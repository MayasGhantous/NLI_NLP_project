  we also still have hereditary positions where you inherit your seat in the house from your father . 
  37 % , and yet we are the only country other than iran who allocates seats in the upper house to clergy . 
  maybe i 'll start lining the pockets of my suits for this exact possibility . 
  i guess it depends whether your nob is particularly cheesy or crusty, 
  we 'll do it live !, 
  but he has * strong feelings * about it . 
  the conservative unionist party could be responsible for destroying two of the most important unions in british history . 
  bloody shambles . 
  best of luck to scotland , enjoy the austerity and euro, 
  we 're still going to subsidise gas and oil though , and `` maximise asset recovery from the north sea '' . 
  18 in the south of the uk . 
  it saves money on production , you take one car and just change the body work . 
  seats are basically vws underneath , same with renault and nissan now . 
   [ let 's all agree that it 's the english fault . 
  the brexit one triggered me, 
  does n't have to be the dems . 
  i 'd op for a george bush over trump . 
  launched 106 years ago . 
  absolutely scandalous that you would all mistake sir nicholas teslebottom of northumbledale . 
  this is the second comic i 've seen in this thread , which has the us flag representing english in a comparison of european languages ( \u0ca0_\u0ca0 ), 
  this is n't a drawing competition . 
  i thought it was greater brttany , with the french brittany being the lesser ( smaller ) one . 
  i know you 're joking , but europeans were folding and braiding steel hundreds of years before japan . 
  but you have things like linux mint , or the [ windows 10 theme ] ( https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes/view/windows-10 ) , or even an [ xp theme ] ( https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes/view/mint-xp ) for those who lack imagination . 
   the former campaign director of vote leave , dominic cummings , argues that the better educated are more prone to holding irrational political opinions because they are more driven by fashion and a group mentality . 
  wtf ? 
  i just wash my dick in the morning , then i 'm good for the day . 
  so she 's scandi sandi ? 
  so it 's my daughter 's problem ? 
   . . the fact is that both countries have overcome the 2008 crisis faster than their rivals ... yeah , [ no . 
  ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/files/2015/03/machin-fig-3.jpg ) we have both had record high share indices , but that means nothing to most people . 
  do n't feel so bad . 
  english spelling is terrible . 
  that 's a pretty big place though , and some places would probably handle it better than others . 
  i wonder where the energy will go if it is n't heating europe ? 
  it covers the uk and then wipes out london . 
  clearly someone has tried to leak some serbian battle plans . 
  another 3.6 million , and they 'll be as big as tokyo . 
  the 1066 club . 
  that 7 % are going to have a much higher level of disposable income and ability to consume compared to much of the world . 
  what a numpty .

  landrover and jaguar are owned by tata motors ( india ) . 
  no , guns that fire boats at people . 
  we 'll rename the eu to the nhs . 
  problem solved . 
  so you know the oldest church of every country ? 
  yes . 
  northern rock 's business model relied on heavy borrowing . 
  the us subprime mortgage crisis created a global credit-crunch that caused northern rock to lose access to liquidity and thus required bailing out . 
  the fact they went before bears sternes and lehman brothers is moot . 
  last i checked the 2008 crash was precipitated by us mortgages , not uk debt , so comparing the levels now and then are moot . 
  i think the big concern though is that a hard brexit will hurt the economy and peoples ability to keep up with repayments . 
  aurochs are basically wild predecessors of modern domesticated cattle , so in a sense we already do farm them for burgers . 
  source ? 
  the 64 % figure came from the london school of economics via [ opinium ] ( http://opinium.co.uk/did-young-people-bother-to-vote-in-the-eu-referendum/ ) . 
  the 36 % figure came from [ sky data ] ( https://twitter.com/skydata/status/746700869656256512 ) . 
  i 'm more inclined to believe a reputable academic institution rather than a murdoch mouthpiece . 
  have n't the people by the bus been run over ? 
   better yet , stop ignoring what the majority of the population wants ... oh , so the leave side have agreed on what it wants ? 
  that 's news to me . 
  maybe someone should tell may and davis . 
   18-25 64 % ! = `` next to no '', 
   only 36 % of young britons voted this meme has to die ** edit : ** [ here 's why . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5kelrc/2016_the_year_of_unwanted_gifts_british_cartoon/dboh6zh/ ), 
  that 's because society is currently a huge pyramid scheme . 
  with the supposed onset of advanced automation we could probably do with less people . 
  it 's just a shame that this news is n't driven by more auspicious circumstances . 
  do n't forget the nice attack as well . 
  jesus it 's been a fucking shit year . 
  have n't most of the terrorist attacks in europe been committed by europeans ? 
  quantitative easing is also causing problems in the us . 
  instead of lending to small businesses and people , banks have used the qe money to buy stocks , subsequently creating a big stock bubble . 
  i have loyalty to my daughter and wife , and i can better provide for them elsewhere . 
  10 % wage decrease since the crash , predicted wage stagnation for the next 10 years . 
  nothing short term about that trend , and i 'm not waiting until my late forties for an improvement in my quality of life . 
  except that 's just not true . 
  i was 23 when the financial crash happened , since then wages have decreased by 10 % ( the only other european county this happened in was greece ) , and now we 're being told it could be another 10 years of wage stagnation due to brexit . 
  you 'd be crazy not to be looking overseas for opportunities at this point . 
  how 's this sign ? 
  is it in the right form ? 
  only if you 're confident that the government , or more precisely those in it , put themselves above everything . 
  they would burn this place to the ground , if that was they only way they could rule it . 
  someone could make the excuse that you 're not in the eu , but then how would they explain ireland and finland ? 
  only a complete moron would think that that is what the info-graphic is saying . 
   % of households who paid a bribe when accessing basic services . 
  note that the above is not the same thing as `` no bribery at all '' . 
  i can believe that nobody bribes for basic services . 
  i 'm guessing this is per family ( i.e. 
  two incomes ) . 
  that 's the only way it makes sense to me . 
  or maybe i 'm just under paid \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
  i had shigella , a close relative of salmonella . 
  i 'm a young healthy guy but that shit almost killed me . 
  would not recommend \u2605 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606, 
   the first prediction was that a vote to leave would trigger a comprehensive review of the entire legal system ** professor of eu law : ** it 's way more complicated than it appears , and will take a long time . 
  it 'll be easy . 
  & nbsp ; hmmm , who to place my trust in ? 
  tough one . 
  oi , not all of us in the sticks voted brexit .
