  / r/unitedkingdom has nearly three times more subscribers than / r/england , / r/scotland , / r/wales , and / r/northernireland combined , so is probably more representative of the whole uk than any of the country specific ones . 
  if i go to / r/unitedkingdom and sort by top all time , boris is the first image link . 
  i ca n't even see those other ones you 've linked . 
  did you use search ? 
  ** edit ** i searched for the first one and it turns out i 'd hidden it, 
  / r/england has ~ 6k subscribers , / r/unitedkingdom has ~ 169k and the top picture is [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/tjknoya.jpg ) . 
  so in your mind , the person screaming to everyone that the house is on fire must be the one who started it ? 
  nicker twisting confirmed . 
   us research and spending into cutting edge technology still dwarfs chinese spending . 
  no doubt . 
  but that was n't what i said . 
  china is the biggest producer of renewable energy , more than double the us . 
  - [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_electricity_production_from_renewable_sources ) . 
  china owns six of the world 's ten largest solar-module manufacturing firms , the us does n't even own one . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renewable_energy_commercialization#photovoltaic_market_trends ) china invests more than twice as much as the us in renewable energy . 
  [ source ] ( http://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chinas-global-renewable-energy-expansion_january-2017.pdf ) china leads the world in green energy investment and renewable energy production . 
   in regards to that recession , europe was harder hit and took longer to recover . 
  again , that is correct , but you 're not responding to what i said . 
  i said the crash originated in the us . 
  particularly it started in the us subprime mortgage market [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_crisis_of_2007%e2%80%932008 ) . 
  this is what happens when you put a fox in charge of the chickens . 
  perhaps a better question is , why does the meat need chlorinating in the first place ? 
  a lot of people getting their nickers in a twist , over europeans apparent inability to count . 
  but the question was who is the `` leading '' economy . 
  china has been the biggest investor in green technology for a while now , they 're also the fastest growing . 
  on the other hand the us is reinvesting in coal , and becoming more insular and protectionist ( if only rhetorically ) . 
  the us was also ground zero for the biggest financial crash since the great depression , and just elected a reality tv star to the presidency . 
  not surprising that people would n't consider them as `` leading '' . 
   but prices will surely stay up . 
  not if nobody buys . 
  ok , that sucks . 
  i 've had friends and family members get my cv into the hiring managers hand , but that 's about it , no guarantee of a job . 
  i know a lot of places in the uk legally have to advertise roles externally , even though they already have someone internally that the role is earmarked for ; so wondered whether teo_vas was referring to that practice . 
  allocated internally ? 
  from within the business ? 
  except england and scotland do n't issue visas separate from one another , much in the same way that they do n't issue passports . 
  and karma is a sanskrit word . 
  we arrest people for tweets , and have things like injunctions and libel laws ; so no , we do n't . 
  recent data has shown , that the economic growth in the later half of last year was driven by unsecured debt , and reductions in savings ? 
  we now have high public debt , record low savings , and averagr wage growth has fallen three months in a row . 
  and prices are expected to go up with the currency drop and inflation . 
  if it 's any consolation , more people died during the 1918 spanish flu epidemic than both wars combined . 
  sounds like your toilet needs oiling . 
  testosterone , it 's a hell of a drug . 
  i 'm by the yellow bit at the bottom . 
  it got so hot today that the road surface in my street started to melt . 
  www.dropbox.com \u30ce ( \u00ba _ \u00ba\u30ce ), 
  oslo seems like a middle ground . 
  not for a while now . 
  it seems every summer we have a `` heat wave '' and winter does n't really come . 
  i guess it 's climate change . 
  plenty of tea , that 's why we need the biscuits . 
  you love it, 
  the `` great '' denotes that it is the larger of the brittanies ( great in size ) , with the lesser being in france . 
  previously the homes of the briton people . 
  also we 're grrrrrreat !, 
  we have the frenchiest germanic language . 
  well , at least 48 % of us anyway . 
  we 've barricaded ourselves in under the stairs . 
  send help , and biscuits . 
  idk , the great war was pretty bad . 
  i do n't think they 've ever really changed . 
  their computer viruses need a little [ work . 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/fh8vpxm1ua7z.png ), 
  also disposable income fell three quarters in a row . 
  last time that happened was the 70 's when we were the sick man of europe . 
  public savings also at an all time low . 
  and unsecured debt at near record highs . 
  would could go wrong eh ? 
  good job we 're so strong and bloody stable . 
   though i would feel comfortable calling it a city . 
  it 's about the size of my town here in england . 
  but i guess it 's a matter of perspective , as the uk is a bit more populous than the netherlands . 
  just out of interested i looked to see what the smallest city in the uk was . 
  it was a place called [ st david ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st_davids ) with a population of 1,841 just to confuse matters . 
  so germany replaced a large town ? 
  english is a mongrel language , it 's all a bit weird . 
  so germany lost a large town ? 
  they 're all in norway, 
  umbrella and parasol in english . 
  seems there is more that unites us than divides us after all . 
  they 're currently in social housing claiming benefits from the government . 
  she also has extended family on the continent , and is married to a greek immigrant . 
  or great britain for short, 
  ... and the scottish one . 
  probably did n't put wales as it 's a given . 
  the french one covers uk , and the maltese and northern irish one is suitable for england . 
  absorbed into westminster . 
  wcgw ? 
  pound weakening plus [ this .

  what a time to be alive, 
  you dawg i heard you like democracy, 
  that makes more sense . 
  plenty of dacias in the uk , but i do n't think they have a presence in india . 
  in india the duster is marketed as a renault . 
  they also have the nissan terrano which is basically a duster underneath . 
  not sure why they chose to make it a dacia in europe . 
  we 're currently in afghanistan and iraq fighting these people .
