  because it 's ridiculously excessive and hysterical . 
  it would be the equivalent of the uk banning catholics from italy because of the ira . 
  there is n't a shred of rationality about it . 
  that 's beyond ridiculous . 
  you 're going to sanction 1.6 billion people based on the actions of a minuscule fringe group ? 
  like i said , isis want the west to persecute muslims , and it sounds like you 're more than eager to do so . 
  btw , do you think the central african republic should ban all christians because of the actions of [ antibalakas ? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26274198 ) do any christians here think they should be held responsible for their actions ? 
  should the uk have banned all catholic immigration during the ira bombings ? 
  isis goal is to divide us and provoke the west into persecuting muslims , and create a holy war with the west . 
  there 's so much desire to capitulate in this thread , it 's deeply saddening to think they may achieve that goal . 
  though perhaps there are people in our society who desire the same thing . 
   there 's not one instance in history of a country with population divided into two or more sizable parts , each holding drastically different sets of values and outlooks on life not engaging in a civil war , ethnic cleansing or other mass-scale violence . 
  not one .

  it 's only anecdotal , but as someone with kids and many nieces and nephews , around the age of two there seems to be some very innate gender specific influences on behaviour . 
   it 's more about why women are n't really interested in working in ict maybe men and women are different , and are therefore interested in different things .

  as stated , equality of opportunity is something worth pursuing . 
  ensuring equality of opportunity just makes sense . 
  ensuring equality of outcome is ridiculous . 
  i 'd argue that some of our core european values like egalitarianism , justice , rehabilitation , democracy , etc , are all rooted in christian doctrine such as equality before god , forgiveness , and fairness ( golden rule ) . 
  that 's not to say christians would agree with how those ideas have evolved ( gay rights , etc ) . 
  i hear people in bristol are really good at it .

  `` of the same parents or grandparents , '' c. 1300 , from old french germain `` own , full ; born of the same mother and father ; closely related '' pretty much .

  the uk used to be number one in global soft power , but i think brexit has bollocksed that up . 
  but the term was still 4 years . 
  the government just decided when , towards the end of that term , the elections would be held . 
   instead of having it at a set date ? 
  this is not the norm . 
  a ge happens every 5 years .

  i do n't understand why they 're getting so upset , like praying is going to do anything . 
  i think they 're ok . 
  they were probably arrested for indicent exposure .

  i find it annoying that i fill my car with litres , but its efficiency is measured in mpg .
