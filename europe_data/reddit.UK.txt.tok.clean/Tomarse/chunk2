  interesting fact , the highest scoring raf squadron in the battle of britain was polish . 
  are you suggesting a hiatus of the `` right to roam '' during times of economic difficulty ? 
  if the uk was outside the eu its exported goods would be subject to import duties . 
  though i doubt that would be the biggest problem , as any right minded business would probably up and cross the channel . 
  to clarify , imo thatcher policy was one of many things that led to the crash , but not the only thing . 
  if you have a job that a poor unskilled foreigner can take , then you 're probably on minimum wage anyway . 
  the eu free market is worth # 211 bil to the uk . 
  freedom to roam is a small price to pay . 
  ninja edit : now that uni fees are 9k a year i guess more brits probably are going to be unskilled :-(, 
  the reason so many people are feeling pinched is because they either took on credit they could n't service , or they or someone they rely on lost money when the markets crashed , or because the government spent a huge amount of money bailing out banks and is now trying to scrape it back from welfare and public services .

  an englishmen , irishmen , and scotsman are all running from the law . 
  they all turn down an alley only to find a dead end . 
  the englishmen quickly jumps into a dustbin , the scotsman gets into a crate , and the irishmen climbs into a sack . 
  that moment the police turn up and start looking for them . 
  the policemen kicks the dustbin , and the englishmen goes `` meow '' . 
  just a cat , the policemen thinks . 
  he kicks the crate , `` squeak squeak '' , goes the scotsmen . 
  just a mouse , thinks the policemen . 
  he then kicks the sack and the irishmen goes , `` potatoes '' . 
  confused me as well . 
  does this mean nobody in france knows how to work a computer ?
