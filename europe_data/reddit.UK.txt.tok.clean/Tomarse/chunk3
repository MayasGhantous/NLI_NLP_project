  well i 'm not sure about england in particular , or your metric of `` telling people what to do '' , but the united kingdom has the most powerful military in the eu , and just recently in a global survey of soft power and influence the uk ranked first . 
  we did it reddit . 
  a more recent one would probably be that the political elite rape and kill children on a regular basis . 
  yep , i guess we just keep spinning plates . 
  i agree . 
  the guy above was talking about gassing jews , so was trying to find a less extreme connection . 
  i think the solution is federalisation , like a united states of europe . 
  it would stop money being pumped to one side of the eurozone . 
  greece would also need to sort out its public sector , and all eu countries would be accountable to a eu wide federal body . 
  in very simple terms it would allow the weaker nations to maintain demand for goods produced in the stronger nations . 
  seems i struck a nerve . 
  not sure what it is in my post that suggests i think it 's all a german conspiracy , but for the record i find such an idea absurd . 
  the greece failure was due to a number of reasons , one being the setup of the currency union and a lack of federalisation . 
  germany 's profiteering in this case is due to the fact investors are withdrawing funds from greece and putting them instead into germany . 
  there 's not much germany can do about it . 
  if ww2 has any bearing on this topic , it would perhaps be the contrast between the wholesale debt forgiveness granted to germany , and the austerity and hardline applied to greece . 
  but this 100 bil was not through germany 's `` success '' , but profiteering ( even if unintentionally so ) from greece 's financial collapse . 
  it also , imo , makes the european project look a bit farcical . 
  really ? 
  the west poked the bear for decades . 
  continued and expanded a military alliance originally dedicated to opposing russia , and put offensive military weapons closer and closer to moscow . 
  and then we all act shocked when the bear finally lashes out , and say it 's a war monger . 
  the hypocrisy and self deception is crazy in this thread . 
   yep and we all know how situation on ukraine looks like now the shit hit the fan when ukraine tried to join nato , not because they were n't in it .

  haha , i 'm sure you 're right . 
  that 's a good point . 
  but like i said , they do n't really need it per se . 
  also the condition can come later in life , or after trauma , so even those who do n't have the symptoms right now might still have the problem , it just has n't been expressed yet ( and might never do ) . 
  it 's an odd situation , i should probably ask my parents more about it (  _ < ) . 
  your english is perfect .

  that 's the thing , no transplant is really needed and we would probably be on the bottom of the list anyway . 
  the kidneys start failing but then stop just before . 
  i do n't have the problem , but those who do just have to watch what they eat , avoid certain things , and they can live a fairly normal life . 
  the most extreme case in my family is my aunt , she has to take meds , avoid over exerting herself ; but you would n't know she had anything wrong just by looking at her . 
  i guess the silver lining with these sorts of things is that you know about it and can do something about it . 
  otherwise it 's completely random and out of the blue , as with the op 's post . 
  genetically inherited is perfectly fine , though i think most would just say it is hereditary . 
  my family also has some strange hereditary stuff with our kidneys , they go through the stages of failing but then stop just before going full meltdown , and just stay like that . 
  working , but with the constant threat of failure looming near . 
  i think we 're sited in certain medical journals . 
  there was a tv program a while ago about twins . 
  with one set of brothers , one lived in the uk , drank at the pub everyday , smoked , ate crap . 
  the other lived in new zealand and was a fitness freak , and a vegetarian . 
  the one in the uk had a health checkup and they found his heart had clots and he was close to a heart attack . 
  he told his brother in nz , who then also got checked out , and he had the exact same thing .

  it was illegal to be atheist back then , punishable by death . 
  i 'm sure newton was a true christian , but `` claiming people '' as it were , based on their christianity is pretty empty and insignificant in a system where that belief was enforced by a noose .

  it literally takes two seconds to encode and decode a message . 
  not really that impractical if you keep your terminal open all day like me . 
  there 's probably even a facebook api that would let you automate and schedule it , so you can stick all your messages in a text file and just have it picked up , read , encrypted , and sent out , and visa versa . 
  you host that on a server that 's outside nsa reach and there 's not much they can do other than force fb to close your account .
