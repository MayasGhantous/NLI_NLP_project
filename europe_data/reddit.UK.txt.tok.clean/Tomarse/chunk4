  but most people wont do this ( i do n't ) because most of what we send is pretty boring and above board . 
  i 'm just saying you can get around it . 
  example ; i go to my python ide and import my encryption module . 
  the friend already has the password given on a piece of paper . 
  from their end they just do the opposite . 
     a = decrypt ( ` f1a10bc8001d ' , b ` sc \\ x00 \\ x00  \\ xe8 \\ x03 \\ xfewo \\ xe2 \\ xab \\ xddus \\ x033 % y \\ xec \\ xcd \\ xf8 \\ x93 \\ x93 \\ x19 \\ xb2 = \\ xd9 \\ xf1w \\ xf7f \\ xe9 \\ xf5 = c \\ xe5 \\ x03 # \\ x1d \\ xa1 \\ xe4 \\ xb7r \\ xc89 \\ xd3 < \\ xe2 \\ xa8 \\ xcf ] / . \\ x8b \\ xc9 \\ x18 \\ x18iy \\ xc1 \\ x98 \\ xdb ' ) . decode ( ` utf-8 ' )    print ( a ) ` hello world ' the encryption is unbreakable even for the nsa . 
  it does n't matter if they have a back door , or can unencrypt the connection , because when they read the message it 'll just be a gibberish bytestring . 
  you might be able to ban tech companies from using encryption , but you can no more ban an individual from using encryption , then you can ban someone from using a foreign language . 
  i was just using popular apps as an example . 
  obviously anything originating from the us is going to be open . 
  but my point is that , even on whatsapp and fbm you can send an encrypted message that the nsa can not read . 
  even if they remove encryption and put in a back door to things like whatsapp and fbm , what stops someone from encrypting a message into a byetstring on their computer , pasting and sending it to another person , who then decrypts it their end with a shared password ? 
  it does n't matter that you can read the message if it 's complete gibberish . 
  does the pm not have technical advisers ? 
  pretty sure that 's always been the case . 
  we do n't refer to them as colonials for nothing . 
  can confirm . 
  am weird . 
  as an englishman who does n't drink much , i can never relate with our stereotype . 
  maybe it 's a northern thing . 
  bicester, 
  agree . 
  does n't apply in the south east either . 
  jumping a queue is probably a more national faux pas . 
  i would also add to the list littering ; being loud in public ( unless it 's in a pub , sporting event , or someplace naturally rowdy ) ; and slagging off the royalty ( only we can do that ) . 
   what i do n't understand is this `` natural '' argumentation thing . 
  homosexuals are supernatural . 
  now this thread is starting to get silly . 
  then it 's no surprise that most europeans said no . 
  you might as well asked , `` would you like to walk hand in hand toward a machine gun nest '' . 
  lions lead by donkeys and all that . 
  you say that like wwiii would n't be a nuke lobbing contest . 
  10 euros ? 
  i guess the floor mats were ok . 
  it boggles the mind . 
  i just imagine that when confronted with an opposing opinion irl they just put their fingers in their ears going la , la , la , la. 
   -15 points how dare you not share the same opinion as everyone else . 
  an orbit is not a rotation . 
  nothing is rotating in the classical sense . 
  the earth is travelling in a straight line , and that line goes through a part of space time that has been warped by the sun 's mass . 
  from the sun 's perspective the earth is orbiting it . 
  from the earth 's perspective it is travelling in a straight line and the sun is following it . 
  if we agree that general relativity is the best model we have for the natural world , then there is no rationally empirical reason to pick one frame of reference over the other , even in a simple system such as yours . 
  there is no centre . 
  really ? 
  not that atomic structure comes up much in conversations , but usually people talk about it like a mini solar system with the electrons orbiting the nucleus . 
  which sounds visual to me rather than some ethereal concept . 
  of course its not an accurate depiction but it has it 's uses and is what a lot of people were taught . 
  oohh , i get ya now . 
  my bad . 
  i thought you were saying what has changed since copernicus . 
  current measurements show the electron to have no size , but is n't a size of 0 less than the size of an atom ? 
  or is it just that the size is unknown so the question ca n't be answered ? 
  uhh ... relativity ? 
  right , but this survey is for the general public , so in that frame of context i 'm guessing most people are visualising the bohr model and those asking the questions are probably working on that assumption to . 
  there is no centre , and everywhere is the centre . 
  so the original question is nonsense . 
  because atomic structure is taught to 8 year olds . 
  though i guess if it 's been a while since you left school and you do n't work or have an interest in physics or chemistry , then you 're probably going to replace that information in your head with something more pertinent to your daily life . 
  clicked the link half asleep expecting to see transformer 's erection . 
  the ideals and values your culture and society hold will be rooted in something , and that something will likely be the source of morality for the majority of that cultures existence . 
  in the case of the uk i think that `` something '' is christianity . 
  anybody raised in that culture , whether religious or not , will have their moral compass and values framed in the context of that society and its history , unless they 've sat in a cave and purposely deliberated the minute of every possible moral tangent and created their own treatise . 
   so you find more similarities between you and indian christians than the hindus and muslim ones ? 
  yes . 
   were you even raised christian ? 
  do you check the anglican in the census ? 
  no and no . 
  i think that western liberalism is in some part derived from christian doctrine . 
  social welfare , equality , a strong sense of justice , tolerance , are all christian ideals . 
  i believe in these values , but i can not rationally justify them from my starting point of moral nihilism . 
  some people may , despite technically being atheist , take comfort in remaining christian in name . 
  perhaps they see it as part of their cultural identity . 
  sort of like those who complain about the royal family , but jump to their defence should a foreigner do the same . 
  it 's part of your cultural history even if you 're critical of it , or do n't really believe in it . 
  culture . 
  i 'm agnostic atheist , but one thing i 've noticed moving around the world is that i 'm culturally christian in the values i hold and the way i think people should be treated . 
  you ca n't escape your history i suppose . 
  in the metros it 's insane , but like i said i 'm in a remote part so there is n't that many people for queueing to be an issue . 
  the worst here is probably the post office which i avoid at all costs . 
  it ai n't half hot mum . 
  i 'm actually in the north east where most of the tea plantations are . 
  the tea is amazing and dirt cheap to boot . 
  speaking of the states , there is an american here who has resorted to growing and processing his own coffee . 
  the coffee you get here is dire . 
  i call it a cup of brown . 
  i 'm british living in a remote part of india at the moment . 
  i miss paved roads , hot showers , and my mum 's roast dinner . 
  i guffawed . 
  hold my helmet . 
  as a native of poole , i can assure you we have great beaches . 
   ... problem solved . 
  well , until africa ends up where america is now . 
  and then they decide that being a consumer economy is unsustainable , and that they should work towards being an export oriented economy running a surplus . 
  welcome to neo-classical economics . 
  modern economies are based on the assumption of infinite growth in the long term . 
  hard to do that ( though not completely impossible ) if your population shrinks . 
  whose going to buy all the stuff ? 
  in latvia , indulgence is having two potato .
