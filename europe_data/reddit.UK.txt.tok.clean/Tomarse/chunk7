  and what percentage of the economy is reliant on the financial services ? 
  cleaners , car hire , hotels , catering , printing services , etc , etc. 
  i used to work for a large bank and we bought a lot of goods and services from surrounding businesses . 
   and we 're nice . 
  hey , i 'll have you know that i am down right tolerable . 
  mint means good . 
  if something is in mint condition then it 's as if it was new . 
  and if you 're minted then you 've got a lot of money . 
  i would say more like 70 % , though most informal speech is old english ( germanic ) in origin . 
  this is a major simplification of a complex issue . 
  the financial sector accounts for 11 % of uk tax receipts , and employs over a million people . 
  you ca n't just pull that from the economy and not expect an utter disaster ( far worse than the financial crash of 2008 ) . 
  it 's possible to be critical of these institutions and still acknowledge our dependence on them . 
  things are n't all black and white . 
  barclays were bailed out , just not by the uk government . 
  a couple of days ago some refugee immigrants came riding into our village on horseback , and killed 90 % of us . 
  our primitive stone age technology was useless against they 're magical shouting sticks . 
  it really is getting out of hand . 
  i ca n't return to my people 's lands now because a few farmers have settled their , and they are protected by their local military outpost . 
  i fear it wo n't be long until every anglosaxon is wiped out , and our once proud tribe is relegated to the history books . 
  please send help ... and tea . 
  they were too busy watching their wages stagnate , getting into debt , and being screwed by the landed class , that they forgot to procreate . 
  down with algebra !, 
  pahaha , loving the double standards . 
  read my comment again . 
  the far left and right both bring people together through fear and hatred of an other , which they blame all of society 's ills on in a simplified way . 
  whether it 's jews , muslims , bourgeoisie , capitalists ; it 's all the same game . 
  i guess it 's seen as an insult due to the far left and right 's recent contributions to human history . 
   no facts or figures , just pure emotion . 
  that 's how the far right operates . 
  they ca n't actually do much about these recent terrorist attacks , so they try to look as if they have control and are proactive , by banning something innocuous like the burkini . 
  it 's seriously pathetic , but it panders to people 's fears . 
  i doubt most jamaicans would consider themselves of anglo saxon descent, 
  cock taste good and it will be 26 years . 
  religion is n't some monolithic block where everybody has the same standards and interpretation of doctrine . 
  everyone is a religious offender to someone else somewhere , because everyone has a different interpretation of the rules and their order of importance . 
  burka wearers ! = all muslim women, 
  so would the uk not be in europe if art50 was triggered ? 
  not that [ most brits ] ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/british-dont-think-they-are-european-2016-4 ) consider themselves europeans ( unfortunately ) . 
  who would store weapons on their face ? 
  so could a trench coat and a clown costume , we banning those as well ? 
  i agree . 
  have any of the terrorist attacks been performed by people in burkas ? 
  then what 's the problem exactly ? 
  italian police cook elderly people ... pasta, 
  on a somewhat separate note , the oslo times hate mobile users . 
  srsly , it 's [ current year ] people !, 
  yeah , sucks if you just want to buy something , get your haircut , or eat a meal . 
  also the ai and robots are set to eat away at the already diminishing middle . 
  so instead of the bottom 10 % being disgruntled , you may end up with the next 50 % or so joining them , and then things start to get really interesting . 
  brexit and an encryption ban , it 's like we 're desperate to get rid of our financial and tech industries . 
  we could still get it to work ...  do not , my friends , become addicted to the sun . 
  it will take hold of you , and you will resent its absence !, 
  i 'm 198cm and currently living in a remote part of india . 
  at first it was cool having everyone stare and crowds of kids follow you everywhere like your own personal miniature pose , but after three years it 's now just annoying . 
  also walking down the high street and having to both avoid falling down holes on the path , as well as having to avoid signs and garrotting yourself from above , is not fun . 
  though it does increase your ninja exp . 
  how bad is bosnia and herzegovina ? 
  how about albania ? 
  malaysia is n't doing too bad . 
  1 year `` whose turn is it ? '', 
  ... that takes out deutsche bank . 
  bosnians playing on hard mode . 
  i hear a lack of pirates is also causing global warming . 
  and this is without article 50 being triggered . 
  i voted remain , but now i have a morbid curiosity as to what would happen if it was triggered . 
  sort of like looking over a big drop and feeling it pull you over . 
  it 's the brexiters paradox , when your nationalism makes you vote for an `` independence '' that destroys your nation . 
  but if scotland had an unofficial referendum and then unilaterally declared independence as a result , what could the u.k. do ? 
  theresa may might not want to be the prime minister who loses scotland , but i doubt she wants to be known as the one who starts our second civil-war either . 
  i think we should go even further , and restore the uk to the beaker people . 
  all the jutes , angles , and saxons , can return to germania . 
  so would that eventually just turn into a use ? 
  the ol' you need to tolerate my intolerance gimmick . 
  sorry , but i 'm not buying . 
  wanting to blame over a billion people for the acts of a super tiny sub group of those people is bigoted . 
  calling it out as bigoted is not . 
  as someone with muslim relatives , i accept that you 're a bigot . 
  pork roast ? 
  sure , but some pretty crazy comments though . 
  that 's a minority of people , who are usually called out as crazy by everyone else . 
  however there are a lot of people who discuss the instability and weakness of the eu and especially the eurozone . 
  something which is immediately downvoted if brought up on this subreddit . 
  [ this is currently a top post . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/4s6vqd/can_rukpolitics_predict_whats_going_to_happen/ ), 
  because homosexuals [ are the manliest of men . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/6xxik6z4exs?t=3m ), 
  i would recommend that people actually read the article . 
  except the gbp has been hit [ a lot worse ] ( http://fxtop.com/en/historical-exchange-rates-comparison.php?c1a=eur&amp;c1b=usd&amp;c2a=gbp&amp;c2b=usd&amp;c3a=&amp;c3b=&amp;c4a=&amp;c4b=&amp;c5a=&amp;c5b=&amp;c6a=&amp;c6b=&amp;dd1=20&amp;mm1=06&amp;yyyy1=2016&amp;c7a=&amp;c8a=&amp;c9a=&amp;c10a=&amp;c7b=&amp;c8b=&amp;c9b=&amp;c10b=&amp;b=1&amp;p=&amp;i=1&amp;dd2=08&amp;mm2=07&amp;yyyy2=2016&amp;m=0&amp;btnok=go%21 ) than the euro . 
  and if we leave the eu they 'll still have all their trade deals as well as all the business and talent who leave our shores . 
  the uk government blocked the eu from raises import tariffs on chinese steel . 
  if you take the referendum votes and map them across the constituencies , the leave vote becomes something like 65 % instead of 52 % . 
  perhaps the same people who bought up the populist rhetoric of the leave campaign also bought the rhetoric of the tories , and their promises to ring fence the nhs and not reform it , or to be the `` greenest government ever '' , or the number of other promises they reneged on ; and perhaps they thought milliband eating a sandwich looked like a mong . 
  austerity taking its toll, 
  that 's the saddest thing . 
  it looks like the things they were protesting about are only going to get worse outside the eu . 
  they could lose nissan , and the tories are reducing the corporate tax rate and will probably double down on the city to reduce the impact of brexit . 
  there was a vote that covered their complaints about a year ago , it was called the general election . 
  i agree , this is the only way we could ignore the referendum and not have parliament burnt to the ground . 
  however , when you look at parliamentary constituencies and then work out their leave/remain vote tendency based on the referendum , leave would win 421 of the 650 seats ( i.e.
