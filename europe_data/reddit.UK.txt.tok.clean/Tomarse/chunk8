  64 % leave instead of 52 % ) . 
  so it may not be the get out of jail free card some of us would have hoped for . 
  i would also expect ukip to take a lot of the northern labour seats seeing as labour campaigned for remain . 
  this is true . 
  but perhaps with everyone buying torches and pitchforks it might boost our economy out of stagflation . 
  this will never happen . 
  firstly , ignoring the referendum is not undemocratic . 
  the ref was advisory only , and any rejection by the hoc would be within the confines of standard operating procedures for the representative democratic system that governs the uk . 
  second , even if you could convince yourself that article 7 applies , it requires unanimous support by the council , and czechia had already said it will do anything to avoid a brexit . 
  it would also draw light on other referendums within the eu that have been ignored , such as greece . 
  nothing is going to happen until we get a new prime minister , and as far as i 'm aware all those applying for the tory leadership ( i.e. 
  to become prime minister ) have said they 'll trigger article 50 . 
  it just ranges from `` as soon as i 'm in office '' , to `` end of the year '' . 
  there might be a legal requirement where it has to be voted on by the commons , but anyone who votes remain against there constituents ( which is nearly everyone ) wo n't see another term . 
  if conservative and labour both vote against the people , then they could become minor parties in the next ge . 
  haha , look at those suckers still in the frying pan . 
  say , can you smell something burning ? 
  this is peanuts . 
  wait until article 50 gets triggered . 
  but have you seen the ftse100 ? 
  i 'm sure the eu expats here also spend their salaries in the local economy , so there is n't much difference there . 
  but the retirees would require more services from the nhs , eu migrants on average are in their early thirties . 
  what are the chances that nhs funding will increase ? 
  there are about half a million retirees in [ eu countries . 
  ] ( http://tabulation-tool.dwp.gov.uk/100pc/sp/cccountry/cat/ccgor/a_carate_r_cccountry_c_cat_p_ccgor_claimants_living_abroad_aug15.html ) i am saying that retirees are not net contributors . 
  generally speaking the older you are , the more you will rely on healthcare services . 
  yes , but the sterling is stronger than the eu , so it 's considerably cheaper to pay for an op in spain than have it done in the uk . 
  most eu migrants in the uk are young working adults and are net contributors to the nhs . 
  a lot of migrants in the uk are nurses and doctors . 
  most british nationals in the eu ( think spain ) are retirees who will take more from a healthcare system than they put in . 
  so it 's in our interest to keep everyone where they are . 
  what are you talking about , they are neolib policies . 
  deregulation , privatisation , austerity , small state , free trade , and low taxes on the rich and businesses . 
  easier to just say neoliberalism . 
  oh absolutely . 
  and the tension between the elite and working people will become even greater . 
  or india . 
  now i feel dirty . 
  in a good way . 
  what just happened ? 
  a pro neolib article in the leftist guardian . 
  whatever next . 
  and oddly , the article is praising the thing which might have underlined the brexit vote in the first place . 
  the last few decades have shown that neolib policy only really worked out for the top portion of society . 
  and what about your mum 's opinion ? 
  hey , i 'll have you know i 'm absolutely gorgeous . 
  it 's good to know the person who 's fucking you . 
  that would require a unanimous vote by the council , and slovakia has already said it will do anything to avoid a brexit ; and i suspect a few other members would also hold similar views . 
  not to mention that the [ hypocrisy ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-ignore-lisbon-treaty-nice-treaty-ireland-greece-france-netherlands-a7105261.html ) and unfairness of such an act would probably weaken and destabilise the union further , adding fuel to the already strong euroskeptics . 
   the rest of the eu can not accept such a blatant violation of democracy and still allow the uk to be a member state and what mechanism would the eu use to oust the uk ? 
  and has anyone told greece that they have to leave ? 
  only the best for my bumholio . 
  but he has [ strong opinions ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2012/3/12/1331571750348/stephen-collins-17-march--001.jpg?w=940&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=49ed83844fa6a84099a085229c05f2f7 ) about government . 
  it 's ok , it 's not like i needed to sleep tonight . 
  also pretty sad that this has 1,374 views and brexit the movie has 2,187,601 . 
  [ oh yeah ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/03/nigel-farage-uses-private-company-reduce-tax-bill-ukip ) those [ tax dodgers ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-tax-return-avoidance-evasion-haven-refuses-to-publish-details-a6978861.html ) are a real problem . 
  so is pretty much everyone in british politics . 
  he wanted to remove climate change from the school curriculum , he said the iraq war would bring peace to the middle east ( lol ) , and he wants to replace the nhs with a private healthcare system . 
  he also had strings leading back to murdoch . 
  you 'd probably end up with a black and red arse as well . 
  it 's the same old story of millionaire etonian politicians being completely out of touch with the electorate . 
  they were so convinced a remain win was a certainty that they hardly bothered . 
  but you only need to look at the last few years to see that this has been slowly bubbling to the surface . 
  the tories have been cutting welfare and public services during an economic slump . 
  but the people only see long queues for doctors and full schools and assume the country is full , rather than poorly managed by neolib ideologues who want to run the country into the ground so that they can privatise it . 
  boris gave respectability to a campaign that would have otherwise been made up of a couple of fringe politicians . 
  but no doubt there is plenty of blame to go around . 
  from cameron for allowing the referendum in the first place , to the inequality in society and the austerity programme and shitty tax laws which exacerbated the issue further . 
  hey , i said an ounce . 
  at least he had an ounce of competence . 
  and he is more centrist than may and gove . 
  uk would still be in the single market for at least two years post article 50 being initiated . 
  those two years can be extended at the discretion of the eu . 
  not sure what the chances of it being extended for a decade are though . 
  i do n't know . 
  he had a cushy mep job from which he could moan and whine and play the people 's champion . 
  i 'm sure he 'll miss it . 
  i never thought i 'd say this but ... can we have cameron back ? 
  cheaper than toilet roll though . 
  looks like trump is crumbling anyway . 
  now you only need hilary to be indicted and you 're set . 
  2016 will be known as the year politics went full retard . 
  his tax free offshore accounts will probably tide him over . 
  sucks is an understatement . 
  the ceo of the lse has said he expects the city will lose [ 100k jobs ] ( https://twitter.com/_benwright_/status/748067642460733440 ) post brexit . 
  no wonder the former cheif of the oecd has said he 's more concerned about brexit than he was about the uk during the 2008 financial crisis . 
  this could put the uk back several decades . 
  i work in banking but thankfully my wife is irish , so looks like i 'll be applying asap for citizenship . 
  and then ... . . moving to frankfurt ? 
  fuck knows . 
  looks like the french want to push an [ eea deal ] ( https://mobile.twitter.com/b_judah/status/748097437047332864 ) that let 's us control our borders , but removes passporting rights for the banks . 
  in any case , outside the eu we will definitely loose the euro clearing business . 
  what 's that saying ? 
  great cunts think alike ? 
  the biggest gripe the leavers had with the eu was that it was anti-democratic . 
  cameron has sort of painted us into a corner . 
  if we ignore the referendum it will likely cause mass civil unrest , and ukip may become a major party in the next ge and take us out the eu anyway . 
  all our options at the moment are just various shades of shit , which is probably why cameron has run away and boris is no where to be seen . 
   and knows how to deal with it 's own referendums . 
  by ignoring them .
