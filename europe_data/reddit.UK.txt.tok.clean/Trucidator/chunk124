  beyond the law there are things like balance of power . 
  this is what is currently happening . 
  juncker is trying to tip the balance of power in one direction and cameron is trying to tip the balance of power in the other direction . 
  politics got interesting . 
  in that case i will answer tomorrow if i am on here and see it :-), 
   do you think that the presidential debates were done for fun ? 
  do you think the rule of law is for fun ? 
  the elections were run this way by some parties and in some places in the eu . 
  but some other parties did not run them in this way and specifically said that they should not be run in this way . 
  and in case of conflict between different ideas about how the commission president should be chosen , my preference is that the law should be observed . 
   because the election has been run on the basis that one of the spitzenkandidaten would become the next commission president . 
  that does n't change the law though . 
  the law remains article 17 ( 7 ) of the teu . 
  i did n't fill in the survey because a lot of my answers were n't options . 
  see below for my actual answers . 
   do you think freedom of movement within the european union is a benefit ? 
  ( schengen area ) the concept of free movement and the schengen area are separate . 
  i think in the case of both there are some advantages and some disadvantages . 
   do you think european union citizens from other countries should be able to work in your country ? 
  in general terms , yes . 
  however , i think this should depend on other factors too ( e.g. 
  impact on infrastructure / housing / needs of economy ) etc. 
   do you think there european union citizens from other countries should be able to live in your country ? 
  do you mean live and not work or study etc ? 
  yes , in general terms . 
  but again this should depend on other factors too ( as per question 2 ) . 
   how would you address immigration concerns ? 
  leave eu and eea , give control of immigration to national parliament . 
  enact legislation similar to canadian legislation . 
   how do you view the european project ? 
  some good things and some bad ones . 
   did you vote in the last european elections ? 
  yes  which way did you vote ? 
  ( you have them listed under two options ) . 
   was your vote a protest vote or a genuine display of your views ? 
  neither of these really , but the best way to achieve the outcomes i want . 
   is your preferred political party ... 
  socially and economically libertarian , but not full-on somalian style ;-)  what is your biggest priority for the european union ? 
  either pull out or massive and dramatic downsizing !, 
   iirc there is not law that governs how the prime minister of the uk is choose , would n't you agree that it would be undemocratic if someone from a fringe party was named prime minister instead of the candidate of the party with the most seats ? 
  in the uk we do n't have a law here , [ but we do have a constitutional convention ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitutional_conventions_of_the_united_kingdom ) . 
  thus , in the case that a fringe party were named pm , it would be a breach of this constitutional convention . 
  constitutional conventions are almost never broken in the uk and if they are broken new laws are enacted . 
  so the situation is quite a bit different from the eu where this is a specific legislative provision governing how the commission president is chosen . 
  edit - thanks for the downvotes !, 
   i do n't think anybody is claiming that it 's illegal . 
  but it is wrong . 
  i 'm not really understanding this argument . 
  if he can get a blocking minority against junker , why should n't he do that ? 
  the treaty of european union specifically envisages different council members voting in different ways and specifically allows a blocking minority . 
  interesting . 
  i guess afd will be standing again for the next german federal elections on a stricter non-eu immigration platform ( among other things ) ? 
  i voted for ukip and would like the uk to have something somewhat similar to the canadian immigration policy ( taking into account the changing needs of the uk economy and so forth ) across the piece ( and basically not favour the eu over the rest of the world ) . 
   it seems everyone is a little gloomy because of the populist upsurge . 
  [ not everyone is gloomy .

  out of interest , did you vote afd ? 
  what were the main motivations of the people that did vote afd ? 
  all my german friends voted cdu/csu , but i know a couple of non-german eu citizens living in germany that voted afd ( mainly on a general eusceptic basis ) . 
   the epp has won the most seats . 
  the epp 's candidate is juncker . 
  in what democratic country would that not mean that he should try to form a government first ? 
  article 17 ( 7 ) of the european treaty gives the council considerable flexibility . 
  this is no legal requirement for juncker to be given an opportunity to form a government first . 
  if you want the treaty to change , that 's fine . 
  but what cameron is doing is entirely within the law . 
  edit - which is more interesting , engaging with the legal/political argument , or downvoting ? 
   correct me if i 'm wrong , but treaty changes have to go through the european parliament , no ? 
  my understanding is that because only the member states are signatories to the treaty , if all the member states agree to treaty changes then the parliament can not stop them . 
  but i will admit that it is a long time since i looked closely at what the treaty exactly says and perhaps i will check this point when i get the time . 
   the majority does not vote always the same on the same issues . 
  alliances vary with the themes on which they vote . 
  is n't this just the normal operation of democracy ? 
  if ukip ca n't block this by themselves and they need to make varied alliances with others to get a majority , and sometimes they are successful in these alliances which do not work out in your favour , it seems that you are not so much critical of ukip , but critical of the system of varied alliances and majority voting . 
  anyway , i now feel bad about la sardenga . 
  where do i send the cheque ? 
   it 's counterproductive is it ? 
  the debate in the uk has just changed dramatically . 
  it seems like my vote was very productive . 
   now they can , thanks to this awesome alliance of new parties . 
  before , thank god , they could n't . 
  it 's majority voting , but you have to mobilize your group , or a good group of meps in the committee . 
  the committee is not the plenary : it 's not that difficult . 
  you think ukip are going to be in the majority voting against funds to italy ? 
  if so , seems like you are n't just annoyed at ukip . 
  you are annoyed with the democractically elected majority . 
   i can wait for my country to change or i can get money for those who need it from other sources , in this case the eu . 
  do you think i 'm gon na wait ? 
  this is kind of exactly the same place as i am when it comes to a referendum on uk membership of the eu . 
  i can wait for my country to change . 
  do you think i am gon na wait ? 
  we 're the same . 
   they do when ukip meps vote against flooding funds because `` to support the solidarity fund means to give more power to the eu '' . 
  i 'd like themto go tomy region and tell directly to the victims of the floods . 
  are ukip going to be able to block this by themselves ? 
  serious question . 
  how are others going to vote ? 
  does this require unanimity ? 
  i thought this kind of stuff was majority voting ? 
  if you have lived in italy , you know very well the monstrous differences between regions .
