  elected representatives should represent the electorate : if some of the electorate is eusceptic , well , that 's democracy for you . 
  the independent are also reporting that the victim claims that the attack came because he was involved in ukip and from labour supporters . 
  i suspect that there is more to it than that , however , it does seem reasonably possible to me that politics were a factor . 
  [ this has also been reported by the independent ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/ukip-candidate-bobby-anwar-stabbed-in-the-face-in-attack-9410465.html ) . 
  i 'm still not seeing why this is relevant . 
   if they did , they 'd realise just how idiotic voting for ukip in the european elections is . 
  voting ukip in the european elections changes the political debate in the uk and puts pressure on the conservatives and the labour party to change their positions on the eu . 
  that 's why voting ukip in the eu elections is sensible . 
   the fact that farage may be a racist is vastly less interesting than the fact that his signature policy is foolish . 
  why is pulling out of the eu foolish ? 
  switzerland and norway do fine . 
  australia , new zealand and singapore do fine . 
  i 'm pretty sure the uk could do fine too . 
   please ignore our paychecks from brussels when we get elected . 
  we 're only doing this for you relevance ? 
   them leaving the union ? 
  or do they offer this kind of thing all the time ? 
  over the last 25 years or so , scotland have been offered more and more . 
  it 's going to be interesting to see how this develops . 
  i think the ecj tends to follow the opinion of the a-g in roughly four fifths of cases . 
  if the ecj do give a ruling on the lines of the a-g 's opinion , then the uk will likely think that it has legal grounds : ( i ) child benefit to eu immigrants whose children do not live in the uk and ( ii ) to extend the period of time that eu migrants have to live in the uk before they are automatically entitled to benefits ( currently it is three months ) . 
   if someone registers in britain as a uk citizen , i 'd be happy to consider them british . 
  why should it be any different in romania ? 
  this comes down partly to a difference between civic nationality and ethnic nationality . 
  britain and romania have different legal traditions for nationality . 
  in britain , nationality is now based primarily on where you are born ( jus soli ) and the idea that if you have a british passport you are a british national . 
  in romania nationality is based on your blood ( jus sanguinis ) and the idea that if your parents are romanian , you are romanian . 
   could you be even more disingenuous ? 
  i 'm being accurate about what the question actually was . 
  accuracy is important . 
   see , this is the same excuse you used last time we had this discussion : farage is not a racist , he just words things poorly all the time . 
  farage generally words things well , but all politicians word things poorly some times . 
  your case against him being a racist is a very weak one and ignores countless amounts of evidence to the contrary . 
  [ if he were racist , why would he be so keen to get ethnic monorities to stand for election in his party ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/474603/you-can-never-call-us-racist-again-ukip-s-black-and-ethnic-minority-members-fight-back ) ? 
  how can you explain this if you think he is racist ? 
   ok , i think it 's safe to say we have reached a point where that excuse does n't fly anymore and you are either 1 ) completely deluded of what 's obvious for everybody else or 2 ) a cynic that supports a racist . 
  i do n't think this is obvious to everyone else . 
  i think it is obvious to most people that farage is not a racist . 
   answering `` you know what the difference is '' when asked about the difference between german and romanian neighbours is racist . 
  the question that farage was asked was not the difference between having german and romanian neighbours , but the difference between having as neighbours a group of german children and a group of romanian men . 
  ( a somewhat odd question . ), 
  i think farage handled that question extremely poorly and farage has admitted that . 
  however , answering `` you know what the difference is '' to that question is not racist . 
  what makes you think farage is racist ? 
  wanting the uk to leave the eu does not make someone a racist . 
  [ ukip 's immigration policy would mean that a greater percentage of immigrants to britain would be non-white than is currently the case ] ( http://www.breitbart.com/breitbart-london/2014/04/28/ironically-ukip-s-immigration-policy-is-the-least-racist-of-all-four-parties ) . 
  and of course , [ ukip are very keen to get as much of the bem vote as they can ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/13/ukip-black-candidates-ethnic-minority-vote-croydon ) . 
  after all , concern about immigration among british bem voters is almostas high as among british non-bem voters . 
   last time i discussed about his one guy tried to spin it by saying that , of course , by white working class farage really meant briton working class and of course it included black and brown british people . 
  the discussion was with me . 
  [ i think you 're referring to the second debate that farage had with clegg on 2 april ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd9rsmd4him ) . 
  in that debate farage mentions the `` white working class '' ( at 26:30 ) and then also `` the afro-carribean community '' ( at 27:50 ) . 
  thanks . 
  i had n't realised that catalan was so widely spoken as a first language outside catalona . 
   well , should n't every single party aim to have meps ? 
  so that they can represent their electorate 's interests ( and their country 's ) in the eu ? 
  yes . 
  this party will not get any meps though . 
   i guess you mean outside catalan speaking areas . 
  yes . 
  does n't `` catalan speaking areas '' broadly correspond with `` catalonia '' ? 
  ok , forget the french . 
  they were n't much help anyway . 
  next time it is just uk v germany . 
  where to start ? 
  belgium or poland ? 
  i know it might not have felt like it , but in ww2 italy were technically mostly on your side ... 
   always 2 against us ... that 's the cowards spirit !, 
  have you forgotten about italy ? 
  it 's `` huit heures et demi ** e ** '' , ( with the extra `` e '' ) but `` une demi-heure '' ( without the extra `` e '' ) . 
  the way to remember the extra `` e '' , according to my old french teacher , is to remember that `` he is after her '' , or ( with the cockney accent of my teacher ) '' ` e 's after ` er '' . 
  actually , more significant than the number of spanish nationals who do n't speak castillian as their native language ( which outside catalonia is a very small figure ) are the number of immigrants to spain who speak spanish as a second language . 
  personally i do n't see there being too much confusion between ukepp and ukip . 
  i 'd be surprised if ukepp get more than , say , 0.5 % of the vote in london and probably quite a bit less . 
  i reckon that aife will be the cause of confusion . 
  i think s/he was reading the map wrong / not understanding the methodology . 
  it is a bit confusing ... 
  both tintin and asterix are massively popular in the uk . 
  i 'd say asterix even more than tintin ... 
  i remember the first time we fought together . 
  i remember the teamwork , the adrenaline , the sheer thrill of fighting along side you . 
  [ but it was nothing compared to the thrill of fighting against you !, 
  ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/609/815/941.png ), 
   and since irish is not only the official language , but also the mother language of ireland , i think there are a few problems here . 
  but a majority of irish people do n't speak irish as their first language . 
  english is their first language . 
   are you saying that irish , the official language of ireland , is not the native language of ireland ? 
  not only that , but that more people speak french than english ... 
  i feel the are a few flaws here . 
  or maybe i 'm reading it wrong ... you 're reading it wrong . 
  irish is the native language of ireland , but most irish speakers do not speak it as their first language . 
  more people speak english than french , but most english-speakers in ireland speak english as their first language . 
  these maps only show second-languages . 
  in britain the walloons have been much more successful at exporting their culture than the flemish ( which is actually somewhat surprising given that the flemish and the english are close relatives ) . 
  [ i blame a certain hercule poirot , the world 's most famous belgian ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/8120568/hercule-poirot-named-honorary-famous-belgian.html ) ... 
  there 's the british people in the uk who learn french to consider . 
   english is the second second most spoken language in united kingdom ? 
  seems likely to me . 
  lots of non-native english speaking immigrants living in the uk speak english as their second language . 
  this number is smaller than the number of british people who learn french , but larger than the number of british people who learn german .
