  my actual belief is that it is slightly more likely that britain stays in , stays complaining , never joins the euro , keeps pushing against the cap and for a common market for services and nothing much changes . 
  us eusceptics have the fight of our lives and we know it . 
  but - is this actually what you want ? 
  faced with a choice with a federal europe without britain or no federal europe but keeping britain in , which is your preference ? 
   the uk is not switzerland , it wo n't magically become switzerland , and it will definitely not be treated like switzerland . 
  it tried to be like switzerland before it joined , but it could n't . 
  britzerland will never be quite as rich and prosperous as switzerland , that is true . 
  but there is no reason why britain ca n't prosper outside the eu . 
   and it will definitely not be treated like switzerland what 's this ? 
  a threat ? 
   the gdp decline after 2008 was weaker for france than for the united kingdom . 
  this is true . 
  the picture has changed a lot since then and the two countries both have different governments now . 
   the uk lacks an adequate industrial sector , that generates a demand for labor . 
  [ the uk has more people in employment now than ever in history ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10524823/pound-spikes-after-surprise-fall-in-uk-unemployment.html ) . 
  [ france has just hit a 19 year high in unemployment ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20131205-french-unemployment-jobless-16-year-high-third-quarter-hollande/ ) . 
  i know which indicators i prefer . 
  well - history will see about that !, 
  switzerland does fine not being part of the eu . 
  britain could do with some of switzerland 's problems . 
  once we 're gone you can set about being a real federation . 
  good luck with persuading the danes , dutch and swedes to vote for that !, 
   i think continued integration is a core tenet of the union ( `` ever closer union '' ) . 
  its rejection amounts to a rejection of the whole in my eyes . 
  this is not supposed to just be a free trade area . 
  democracy is also a core tenet though , is n't it , and mentioned rather more than `` ever closer union '' in the treaties . 
  rejection of the democratic will of the british people , the danish people and the swedish people to hold on to their own currencies is also a rejection of the whole . 
  this is supposed to be about democracy . 
   as for the return of powers to the member states , perhaps some countries would do good to review their own legislation instead of blaming the union . 
  it 's true that britain does need to review its own legislation . 
  [ this is my favourite piece of uk legislation at the moment ] ( http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2013-2014/0063/lbill_2013-20140063_en_2.htm#l1g1 ) . 
  hopefully law in the next year . 
  too funny !, 
  one of the most crazy things i have read on the internet ... 
   the `` unofficial '' but constant blaming of many problems on the eu and the repeated misrepresentation of facts is more toxic . 
  hopefully britain will leave the eu soon and then the eu can all be a lot happier without us !, 
  of course the uk wants cherrypicked membership : that 's what british people want . 
  britain does not want things like eurozone membership because those things would be harmful for britain . 
  what 's your problem with that ? 
  sweden and denmark also want cherrypicked membership . 
  what is going to happen to denmark if britain leaves the eu ? 
  you 're going to force them to give up their opt outs ? 
  no way is that happening . 
   of course . 
  this is n't the end of the world for the eu or the uk . 
  nor is it a massive bonus to either . 
  its a small part in the puzzle , but a part that 's likely more beneficial to the uk than the eu ( at least in terms of the possible renegotiation of powers ) . 
  it is a piece of a puzzle that is true . 
  but the puzzle has thousands of pieces . 
  compared to , for example , how brits vote in the european elections , this is tiny . 
  ( i think we 're basically in agreement though that if it is in anyone 's interests it is in the uk 's interests more than the eu . ), 
   of course as an eu member , the downgrade sucks for the uk as much as any other member state economy . 
  it does n't suck for anyone 's economy . 
  this makes virtually zero difference to anyone 's economy . 
  the amount that this sucks for the uk is somewhere between negligible and zero . 
  it makes a good headline and column inches can be written , but that 's about it . 
  yes - i agree . 
  this kind of stuff is very worrying indeed . 
  join what ? 
  i do n't understand your comment . 
  feel free to explain why you think this is significant if you want . 
  in my view , nobody will be talking about this in a couple of days ' time . 
  the comment section reflects a huge amount of popular opinion in the uk right now ... 
  i 've reread my notes on `` dissemination '' . 
  i agree that there could potentially be a breach - i think it would be fairly hard to prove the `` know the information to be false or misleading '' though . 
  i am going to try and look further into this if i have time . 
  official uk policy is basically : ( i ) for no further transfer of sovereignty from britain to the eu without approval by the british people in a referendum ; and ( ii ) transfer of certain eu competencies back to the uk and then approval of britain 's membership of the eu in a referendum . 
  you can decide for yourself if you think that is `` toxic '' . 
  it 's not the budget that is rated , but the eu 's borrowing . 
  ratings do n't have much to do with budgets . 
  they are about perceived creditworthiness . 
   so it 's hard to believe it will ever be in danger of default you do realise that you are agreeing with s and p here , do n't you ? 
  they also do n't think the eu is in danger of default . 
  that 's why they give it an aa + rating . 
  ratings are one factor among many . 
  there are some institutional investors that have [ policies for some of their funds that only allow them to invest in aaa securities ] ( http://www.netplaces.com/economics/the-great-recession-of-200720/risk-management-and-credit-default-swaps.htm ) . 
  indicators for the uk are better than france ( e.g. 
  uk economic growth is much better than france , unemployment is falling dramatically in the uk etc ) . 
  just to clarify , the downgrade was not because of a reduction in the eu budget . 
  [ it was because the budget negotiatioons were so contentious ] ( http://www.standardandpoors.com/prot/ratings/articles/en/us/?articletype=html&amp;assetid=1245362077132 ) . 
  to further clarify , it was not just the uk that wanted to decrease the budget . 
  other member states ( [ netherlands , sweden ] ( http://euobserver.com/economic/118046 ) ) actually wanted to decrease it by more than the uk did . 
  ( but , given that this is r/europe , please focus on blaming the uk . ), 
  i take it you are not a lawyer ? 
  perhaps you mean the [ financial services and markets act 2000 ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/contents ) ? 
  market abuse under that act relates to dealing based on inside information . 
  credit ratings agencies are not thought of as subject to that because they do not tend to have inside information and also do not tend to deal . 
  misrepresentation is also not really relevant here . 
  that is n't a criminal offence . 
  also , it generally relates to statements made by the issuer of debt , rather than a third party , such as a credit ratings agency . 
   we should stop listening to the rating agencies and look at econometric indicators instead . 
  investors ( obviously ) look at a huge range of factors , including ratings . 
  the eu does borrow on the capital markets , so does have a rating . 
  the downgrade was not because the budget was cut though . 
  [ it was because the budget negotiations were so contentious ] ( http://www.standardandpoors.com/prot/ratings/articles/en/us/?articletype=html&amp;assetid=1245362077132 ) . 
  this is actually very small beer . 
  this downgrade has been widely predicted and priced in for months . 
   yet not a criminal charge ( seriously , is n't this fraud ) . 
  no , this is not fraud actually . 
  there is no law anywhere that says that opinions that are bought are fraud .
