   people might be coming here to work but they 're going to be faced with some extremely hard times , in london at least it was tough for me when i first came . 
  but i do n't regret it . 
  if you 're tired of london you 're tired of life . 
  thanks . 
  an acrimonious break-up will hurt iscotland more than it hurts ruk , which is why i think iscotland will capitulate on some key demands . 
   it is true that wages are still falling in real terms . 
  what kind of miracle is that then ? 
  especially when rental and living costs are skyrocketing . 
  rental and living costs are not skyrocketing , inflation is currently very low . 
  the jobs miracle is that a million jobs have been created in the uk in the last two years , more than the rest of the eu put together , which is why so many people from the rest of the eu are leaving their own countries and moving to the uk . 
  if you want to work , the uk is a good bet for you . 
  many thanks - very interesting . 
   not to mention because scotland has vast unpopulated land you will get crazy money from the eu development fund when you do join that you would n't get as a part of the uk . 
  there 's an eu fund that countries get because they have unpopulated land ? 
  wtf ? 
   scotland is 3 % of the uk 's population . 
   there will be a debate in estonian media on whether it would be good or bad for scotland to become independent . 
  this is r/europe . 
  everyone loves estonia . 
  everyone loves scotland . 
  everyone ( apart from most of scandinavia ... ) thinks that both estonia and scotland can into nordics . 
  everyone is going to want to know exactly what estonia thinks about scotland becoming independent . 
  do make a thread please !, 
  i largely support the united kingdom . 
  however , i know that the success of the uk depends on the consent of the peoples in the uk . 
  i also think iscotland can ( potentially ) do great as an independent country , just as ruk can . 
  i strongly believe in self-determination and am pleased that scotland are deciding this in a democratic way , negotiated with westminster . 
  thus if scots vote for independence i will support their choice . 
  i also think that this vote could potentially have massive implications that are in someways unforeseeable . 
  this is why the world 's media are taking a huge interest in this referendum . 
  but , for a laugh , here are my predictions ... ** result ** - i think there is about 20 per cent chance scotland will vote for independence . 
  though the polls are closer , i do n't think the polls will accurately reflect shy unionists . 
  - if scotland votes to stay in the uk , but the vote is close ( i.e. 
  greater than 45 % for yes ) then there will potentially be another vote within a decade . 
  - if the yes camp get less than 45 % , the union is likely saved for a generation and perhaps more . 
  ** implications for scotland and the uk if there is a `` no '' vote ** - the scottish national party will do well in the general election in 2015 ( consolation prize ) , taking many votes from labour and lib dems . 
  this makes a conservative government more likely . 
  - there will be some people in scotland who claim that the yes camp was robbed - the arguments will continue for years . 
  there is a chance of some violence and civil unrest in scotland on friday and over the weekend . 
  - westminster will begin to make a number of massive constitutional changes . 
  these will cause gigantic rows , especially if england is perceived to get an unfair deal . 
  there is a possiblity that the uk will become a `` de facto '' federation , though i think a `` de jure '' federation is unlikely . 
  there will be many people who will be very angry by these changes , calls for further referendums ( especially in england ) , which i think will be rejected . 
  there is a chance that there constitutional changes will end up causing the break up of the uk anyway . 
  - constitutional debate provokes further constitutional debate , there will be calls to change the voting system , reform the house of lords , pull out of the eu , pull out of the echr , change the constituency boundaries etc etc. 
  ** implications for iscotland and ruk ( and elsewhere ) in the event of a `` yes '' vote ** - there will be some people in iscotland who claim that the no camp was robbed - the arguments will continue for years . 
  - i 'd say 25 % chance that david cameron resigns on friday and a further 25 % chance that the conservative party get rid of him either on friday or within a week . 
  i do n't think this will cause an early general election though . 
  - there is a small chance that there will be a run on the pound and a stock market collapse , that could potentially cause massive financial instability across the globe and particularly the eurozone . 
  - the ruk general election in may 2015 will be fought partly on a `` negotiating with iscotland basis '' . 
  political parties that are seen as being tough on iscotland ( especially the conservatives ) will benefit from this . 
  - there is a larger chance that there will be a small run on the pound , without significant financial implications elsewhere ( other than spain ) but a lot of money leaves iscotland and comes to ruk , causing a gigantic blame game in iscotland . 
  westminster will just say `` we told you so and it is no longer our problem '' . 
  - the ruk government will make an announcement on friday morning that it will not enter into any currency union with iscotland but confirm to the bond markets that it will guarantee all existing debt and that it expects iscotland to pay its share , - iscotland will quickly give up any requests for a currency union ( as these requests will become embarrassing ) and confirm that it plans to set up a new currency , initally pegged to the pound , with a view to joining the euro as soon as possible . 
  there will be anger among some scots at this . 
  iscotland , after some posturing , will agree to pay its share of uk debt . 
  - ruk will say that it fully supports iscotland 's eu membership on an accession basis , to coincide with iscotland 's indpendence . 
  it will try and ensure that iscotland stays out of schengen ( and this will also by iscotland 's and ireland 's position ) . 
  the eu will accept this . 
  - the price of spanish debt will go up considerably . 
  the calls for a catalan referendum will be intense , there may be violence and protests . 
  spain will find ways to slow down iscotland 's accession and try and insist that scotland is outside the eu briefly . 
  there will be gigantic rows across the eu about this . 
  i think that in the end the eu will come down on the side of scotland , but this is by no means certain . 
  - there will be sudden and dramatic seccessionist movements in various parts of the world , everyone will think that if the uk can break up , anywhere can . 
  it is very hard to predict these developments . 
  - iscotland and ruk will reach an agreement under which iscotland joins nato and ruk uses iscotland as a base for nuclear weapons . 
  some scots will complain massively , some english will too . 
  iscotland and ruk will continue to maintain a largely unified military . 
   is there any reason the uk had a pretty much straight line of countries through africa from egypt to south africa ? 
  a massive reason . 
  the uk wanted a secure railway ( for trade etc ) from the strategically placed cairo to the mineral rich cape town . 
  the uk also wanted to ensure that france did not get a straight line of countries going from somalia to senegal . 
  hence , the struggle over sudan ( the place where the two lines intersected ) between the uk and france . 
  judging by the way its circulation figures have collapsed , you are really not the only one ... 
  somewhat lost amid the scotland news is the uk 's continued jobs miracle with unemployment continuing to fall quickly . 
  it is true that wages are still falling in real terms , but in many sectors and in many parts of the uk the job market is very buoyant . 
  note that the quick fall in unemployment is happening at the same time as the fastest growth in immigration to the uk for a while with [ net immigration to the uk being 243,000 in the last year ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/aug/28/uk-net-migration-soars-to-243000-theresa-may ) . 
  the proposal is n't just to stick to the pound , it is to create a currency union with ruk . 
  there is a world of difference between having a currency union and just using the pound without one . 
   however a case could be made that this decision was made for our elected officials by people we did n't elect i.e. 
  the ecb and merkel & co. 
  yes , but elected representatives have not complained about this state of affairs . 
  i actually love irish stew , though i have not exerienced the joys of ulster fry ... 
  i 'm a brit based in london and though i largely support the united kingdom , i know that the success of the uk depends on the consent of the peoples in the uk . 
  i also think scotland can ( potentially ) do great as an independent country , just as ruk can . 
  i strongly believe in self-determination and am pleased that scotland are deciding this in a democratic way , negotiated with westminster . 
  thus if scots vote for independence i will support their choice .
