  from these various different systems there is no reason to say that the only way that constitutions should be changed is by qualified majority . 
   my reason to object is that these differences are not , in my opinion , objectively better than the arrangements of other countries . 
  not being objectively better is not a good enough reason to object . 
   you also support more direct democracy . 
  for those of us that do n't , we tend to feel different about the subject . 
  i acknowledge that not everyone in the uk wanted a referendum , but i think it is worth acknowledging that polls for years showed the british people wanting a referendum on eu membership , a majority of british voters in the 2015 general election voted for parties that had manifesto commitments for a referendum , a majority of mps wanted a referendum and various other parties have over the years promised referenda ( without delivering one ) . 
  it was going to come , it was just a question of when . 
   you 'll find that when a constitution needs to be changed , a simple majority wo n't cut it . 
  this depends on different countries constitutional arrangements . 
  just because your country requires qualified majorities does not mean all countries should . 
  different countries have very different political , legal and constitutional systems reflecting totally different histories . 
  ironically the fact that you want all countries to have similar ways in which their constitutions work and do n't accept that there are differences coming from different countries histories is an example of the inflexibility of the eu - one of the reasons for the leave vote . 
   you argument would be sound if uk law did n't also allow irish , maltese , cypriots ( all eu citizens ) and also commonwealth citizens to vote . 
  why on earth some eu countries could and others could not ? 
  what entitled citizens of some remote island to vote on the referendum more than us ? 
  the thing that entitled commonwealth citizens living in the uk to vote was the fact that the uk parliament elected by the british people specifically decided that that should be the franchise - commonwealth and irish citizens got that vote because of the way that our franchise works and because of the close connection of those countries to the uk . 
  who the uk decide should vote is of course a question for the uk parliament to decide , not a question for your country . 
  thanks , that is interesting [ and somewhat similar to the ft discussion on german politics recently . 
  ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b8287b32-7695-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a.html#axzz4k2ft61co ), 
   he turned a complex policy discussion into a simple yes/no one which people who voted had no idea what exactly they were voting for . 
  the ultimate question , who governs britain and where sovereignty should lie , is not really a complex policy decision . 
  it is of course a decision that only the people can answer . 
  and they have answered it . 
  we can be very grateful for david cameron for confirming that it is ultimately a question for the people as to how they want to be governed . 
   it 's a matter of such importance that the choice of not requiring a qualified majority , at least , was appalling . 
  making it harder for the leave side than the remain side would not be fair . 
  there is no reason why there should have been a qualified majority . 
   further , the referendum did not allow eu citizens in the uk to vote , the very people who will be most affected by this decision . 
  anyone that wants to become a british citizen can apply to become one . 
  but , quite obviously , people that are not british citizens do not get the same rights as non-british citizens in relation to decisions about the uk . 
   other countries do not put matters of foreign policy to referendum . 
  it was just a gamble , which he lost , badly . 
  some countries do , some countries do n't . 
  just because your country does not does not mean that other countries ca n't . 
  it was a fantastic idea for the people to decide . 
   there is a pro-remain majority in the house of commons of 454 mps to 147 . 
  there was a pro-remain majority prior to the referendum . 
  we live in different times now and it is likely ( though not tested ) that there is a pro-leave majority in the house of commons now . 
   did they ? 
  if so , they do n't want to leave . 
  [ yes , you can see how many voted for a referendum here . 
  a large majority of mps wanted a referendum .

   i wander what we can put on them . 
  bridges . 
  you can put bridges on them . 
  you 're welcome . 
  the fact that afd finished fourth but still managed to dominate the headlines is very revealing about current german politics in my mind . 
  exactly because it such an important question , the people had to decide it . 
  i realise that some remainers did not want a referendum because they feared that they would lose it , but a majority of the british people wanted one and a massive majority of mps wanted one . 
  i disagree . 
  we can be grateful to cameron for giving us the referendum which we wanted . 
  this is one of the great things about brexit . 
  it really encourages competition between different countries . 
   out of curiosity , does the law provide for any kind of monitoring for him when he gets out ? 
  yes , it does , which is right in my view . 
  from memory he will be subject to specific monitoring after release - i do n't recall all the details but i think they are covered in the various media reports . 
   think about that . 
  although he should 've gotten more in my opinion , yet i 'm oblivious to what the maximum punishment to these kinds of crimes is in the uk . 
  maybe / u/trucidator is willing to lend a hand ? 
  or someone else knowledgeable of uk law ? 
  maximum sentence available for his specific crime , inviting support of a terrorist organisation , is ten years . 
  the thing to remember about choudary is that he is qualified as a lawyer and for years has used his legal knowledge to go as close as possible to the edge of the law of freedom of expression without going into terrorism offences . 
  this has made him very difficult to prosecute . 
  i think the judge in this case probably went about as far as he possibly could , given the law and the offence . 
   continue to fine the truckers , but take the pool of fines and give it to all truck drivers that have n't had a problem . 
  that 's revenue-neutral as regards those drivers . 
  i like this suggestion , but i do n't think it should be entirely revenue neutral for the drivers . 
  the truck drivers that are not a problem should get money from the pool of fines only once the costs through dealing with the policing issues is removed . 
   british problem only france can solve . 
  correct . 
  ultimately the uk can not control who france lets into france and what france does with those people . 
  that is a question for french government and french democracy . 
  seems like french policy is to let virtually anyone in and then let them live in camps . 
  not much the uk can do about this other than be glad that we have our defences against them , as shakespeare said we are : `` this royal throne of kings , this sceptered isle , this earth of majesty , this seat of mars , this other eden , demi-paradise , this fortress built by nature for her self against infection and the hand of war , this happy breed of men , this little world , ** this precious stone set in a silver sea ** which serves it in the office of a wall ** or as a moat defensive to a house , ** ** against the envy of less happier lands ... ** '', 
  anglo-portuguese alliance , best alliance , 
  we are at an impasse then ... 
  welsh language is insane . 
  the uk government tells ferries who has the right to be in the uk . 
  it is not a secret . 
  if ferries take people to the uk who have no right to be in the uk , the uk fines the ferries . 
  this is what the uk already does with planes and it works . 
  this is why there is no jungle in heathrow . 
   imagine a british guy with a german girlfriend . 
  brits with german girlfriends are no more special than brits with ghanian girlfriends or guatemalan girlfriends . 
   out of curiosity : why ? 
  are there downsides to having two citizenships in uk/ireland i am also entitled to one . 
  i love ireland and have relatives there and visit regularly . 
  but there is no upside to getting irish nationality, 
  get fined . 
   the ferry legally brought a load of people to a border . 
  the border between the uk and france is in the middle of the channel . 
  if ferries take people across that border who have no right to be in the uk , they are breaching uk law and uk can fine them . 
   but if that ends , then french authorities decide who gets on . 
  no , the ferries decide . 
  if the ferries do n't want someone on , they wo n't go on , just as happens now with planes . 
   they only get fined for `` clandestine entrants '' who try to avoid uk border checks . 
  if they just arrive at the border with everyone else then the ferry company does n't get fined , and the person can claim asylum . 
  the reason why they do n't currently get fined is because they have already gone through uk passport control . 
  when this changes , the fine system will change too .
