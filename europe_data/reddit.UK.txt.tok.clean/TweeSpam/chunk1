that whole al magrahi drama was just mental . 
  it showed the us government up as having absolutely no clue how the uk and devolution of powers and governments worked in the uk . 
  you had us senators accusing the uk government of releasing megrahi for bp oil contracts in libya , when the uk does n't have any say in justice matters . 
  then the senators were accusing the uk government of forcing the justice minister to release him , when the uk government itself was publicly denouncing the decision at the same time !, 
  i mean , can you imagine a uk labour london government forcing the snp , a bloody nationalist government in favour of independence to do anything , let alone a fundamentally devolved matter to do with law is laughable . 
  then they went all ` boycott whisky ' etc reminiscent of the `` freedom fries '' episode of a few years earlier and demanded alex salmond to appear before a senate select comittee . 
   nobody tell nigel about this . 
  you 're right . 
  as a new bridge , there 's a vaccant position opened up underneath it for a troll . 
  perfect job for nigel . 
  [ look at a satellite image of scotland / uk . 
  ] ( http://www.eosnap.com/public/media/2009/05/uk/20090511-uk-full.jpg ) it 's all mountains once you get past the central belt . 
  all the brown is basically uninhabitable mountainous regions and can not support large populations . 
  people used to live there , not in very dense populations , but still a decent amount spread out locally ... until the ` highland clearances '', 
  and i guess [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dlc7coi.png ) , or [ this is a representation ] ( http://imgur.com/ycjxd0o ) of srs 's opinion because * this happens daily * it 's often top comments in threads, 
  reddit has roughly 2,329,718 active ( logged in ) users . 
  this sub has 29,700 people . 
  i fail how to see how an upvoted comment can be a consensus for an entire website which receives 70 million monthly unique visitors . 
  no it does n't . 
  more child/mother hate . 
  ** good job , reddit , really . 
  ** you just go on believing that you were never children yourselves and that all children are ill-behaved and must be kept at home . 
  the girl grew up coming to mama 's work , she probably knows the rules . 
  a side note , i remember seeing the first picture shortly after having my child and thinking that it will be okay . 
  if she can do it , with all she 's got on her shoulders , so can i. 
  it was a good moment . 
  i like how one comment is literally all reddit . 
  australia-lite , without the deadly animals but with more awesome scenery . 
  i also found it easier to get laid in nz than aus . 
  such as ? 
  the only thing they depend on the uk for is defence and foreign policy . 
  the uk does not have sovereignty . 
  the queen does . 
  the queen doe n't legislate either . 
  london does n't rule these islands and it 's insulting to the governments elected of these places to suggest so . 
  they have full self-determination and are autonomous . 
  dictating to them on what their own laws should be is a great way for them to vote for full sovereignty independence and remove the queen as head of state . 
   if they really wanted they could change those island laws . 
  the uk government nor parliament have control of those overseas territories laws . 
  if you have a source that they can , please link it . 
  what can the uk do ? 
  these territories have their own independent governments , with their own law systems and elected officials from their own islands and territories from the local population . 
  the governor generals of these places may be appointed by the queen , but they do not rule those places . 
  the governors are just the queen 's representative . 
  they do not make or legislate laws . 
   come on , they all are really small , they could do something about it what could they do about it ? 
  they are not part of the uk . 
  make them vassal states ? 
   of these jurisdictions , 21 are eu-related jurisdictions and ** 10 are uk ( anguilla , bermuda , british virgin islands , cayman islands , gibraltar , guernsey , isle of man , jersey , montserrat and the turks and caicos islands ) . 
  ** they are not uk jurisdictions . 
  they are independent of the uk and there is nothing the uk can do about it , even if they wanted to . 
  there 's a reason for that . 
  the terrain is n't all that suited to build on , [ being mountainous and all . 
  if fred phelps came to the uk , and people told him to `` go back to america '' , would that be racist too ? 
  there 's a difference between telling someone to leave ** based on their views ** and telling someone to leave ** based on their race . 
  they were n't saying that because he was english though . 
  it was to do with him being the leader of ukip and refusing ukips rhetoric and them as a party . 
  england is far more anti-eu than scotland is . 
  it was more of `` go back to england where your views are accepted and where your votes are '' #number of ukip meps in english constituencies : 8 #number of ukip councillors in english constituencies : 201 #number of ukip meps in scottish constituencies : 0 #number of ukip councillors in scottish constituencies : 0, 
   brits do n't want to be in the eu so what 's the problem ? 
  i do n't remember having that referendum . 
  i heard that scotland has been selected for quite a bit of scenes . 
  [ the old man of storr ] ( http://www.scottharrower.com/imgs/gallery/9798/9798_197746094ad5d3088b5ab.jpg ) on the isle of skye is supposedly meant to be yoda 's homeworld . 
  they are not part of the uk . 
  the uk has no power over them . 
  what do you want the uk to do , invade and take them over ? 
  guernsey , jersey etc are not part of the uk as far as i know , and the uk government have no control on its tax policies . 
  hey , i 'll have you know the sun has shined and the temperature risen above 15 degrees twice this year !, 
  you need to remember denmark has high living costs . 
  denmark and the netherlands . 
  competition between energy companies ? 
  ^ ha ^ ha ^ ha, 
  perhaps our czech friend is using cunt in the more friendly , jovial way that the uk , nz and aussies use in reference to our neighbours and best friends . 
  norway exports its green energy during the day and charge a premium ( as per peak demand ) . 
  then imports dirty energy from other countries to pump the water back up its hydro reservoirs when the energy is cheaper at night . 
  not exactly totally green . 
  woah . 
  this has totally changed my perception of our energy prices . 
  i was under the presumption our prices were quite high . 
  but to my surprise not only are we below average for the eu , but we pay the lowest tax on it too . 
  this is exactly why scotland is hosting experimental tidal technology in places like orkney . 
  we have a really vast amount of potential renewable energy . 
  i think we 're expected to generate 50 % of energy coming from renewable by 2015 . 
  the scots government already beat their target of 30 % in 2011 , 2-3 years ahead of target . 
  there will probably always be a need for fossil fuel or nuclear energy for peak demands however . 
  [ does this count ?
