  * [ wikipedia on the toubon law . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toubon_law ) specifically this part :  broadcast musical works are subject to quota rules under a related law whereby a minimum percentage of the songs on radio and television must be in the french language .

  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/8492894/french-radio-stations-fall-victim-to-anglophone-artists.html ), 
  this is incredibly unusual for france and i 'm surprised to see it even suggested . 
  france has a law which bans and sets a quota on the amount of english songs that are allowed to be played on french radio . 
  they ran through a problem that french artists were switching to english and that france was n't producing enough french songs to fill the quota . 
  the economist does have a history of talking shit about france , that 's for sure . 
  i do n't agree with everything you said but i 'll upvote you for your opinion . 
  murica : 311 million people .

  not sure if serious or just netherlands . 
  they were told it would be one reporter and it would be print . 
  when they got to china , they were told it would be three journalists and it would be filmed . 
  in the uk , the bbc are accused of putting the lives of students at the london school of economics at risk by covertly arranging a school trip to north korea for them , and using the students as unknowing cover for an undercover investigation in the rogue state .

  norway has been incredibly future forward looking in investing their oil monies into a sovereign wealth fund . 
  it 's now bigger than their entire economy by 40 % , now sitting at 3.8 tn krone ( # 450bn , $ 670bn ),

  men , when they try to commit suicide , do so with more - erm . . permanency . 
  men do it in ways which there are no going back . 
  hanging , shooting etc. 
  women tend to take pills or slit their wrists ( across , not down ) so fail far more frequently than men . 
  men are just more successfully at their attempts . 
  society does n't offer as much resources or help to men compared to women , as well as gender policing which tells men to `` man up '' and bottle their emotions , rather than seek help . 
  poland is always upside down in country balls . 
  it 's meant to be a running joke . 
  is there a reason why all the country ball 's flags are accurate [ except for the uk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jief8oh.png ) and denmark ? 
  yes , 6th . 
  you 're absolutely correct . 
  but glasgow is n't included on the map . 
  i read somewhere that london is france 's second largest city because there are so many french expats living there . 
  the page format/text/typography reminds me of the guardian and economist for some reason . 
  i personally have nothing to fear from romanian and bulgarian immigration . 
  good luck london though . 
  not quite sure why the uk is the most popular destination for new members of the eu when others are closer . 
  is it because english is their second language ? 
   in 2010 , the latest year for which the data is available , 591,000 people moved to britain - more than double the number who migrated to france , which received 251,200 . 
   spain reported the second highest influx , at 465,200 , followed by italy with 458,900 and germany with 404,100 . 
   these top four countries together took in almost two thirds ( 61.9 % ) of all immigrants entering eu member states , the figures from eurostat showed . 
   the uk also had the highest number of people acquiring citizenship in 2010 , at 194,800 . 
  there is going to be an estimated 50,000 a year in the first five years from bulgaria and romania , but the government 's estimates were lower than what actually transpired the last time , so i 'd expect more than 50k per year . 
  the question that needs to be asked is , can the infrastructure cope ? 
  percentage of england and wales and northern ireland and france 's populations born abroad . 
  correction . 
  afghanistan was controlled by the taliban which harboured al qaeda . 
  the uk is n't part of the 16 member eurozone but is a member of the # 50bn `` european financial stabilisation mechanism '' , which was used to bail out ireland . 
  the uk gave ireland # 7-8 billion . 
  the uk did n't have to pay anything , but did anyway . 
  the uk bailed out ireland and ireland does n't receive much grant money any more due to other more needy countries in the eastern block . 
   all the flags are wrong . 
  the joke is that `` america '' mixes up the flags and the countries are offended by his ignorance and america is then confused by their reactions . 
  the joke is that in the polandball universe , poland 's colours are inverted . 
  no other countryballs are like this . 
  just poland . 
  usaball thinks that because poland is inverted , all country balls must be inverted too . 
  but everyone thinks it because he 's ignorant , when he 's not . 
  it 's a polandball meta joke . 
  everyone in this thread is not getting it . 
  i 've never had thugs chase me around . 
  i 've never been mugged . 
  i 've never been threatened . 
  i 'm not complaining about anything . 
  i 'm just saying a gun would n't have solved that situation unless you wanted to go to prison . 
  how would a gun solve this ? 
  none of these situations would have warranted the drawing of a gun , not even in america . 
  your life needs to be threatened to draw . 
  none of those were deadly force situations . 
  you 'd have your conceal carry revoked if you did in that circumstance and sent to prison - in even the most pro-gun states .
