  islam is the problem in the middle east . 
   having lived in other countries ... life in the uk is n't better or worse . 
  it 's better than somalia . 
   i 'm not going fawn over the uk and pretend it 's a special little island . 
  if something about the uk is good or shit , i 'll point it out . 
  you do n't fawn over it . 
  all you ever do is criticise it . 
  you have an agenda that 's being exposed . 
   however i have no deep seated hatred or love for the uk . 
  it 's quite simply not worth my time . 
  you were born into a war zone in somalia you ungrateful fool . 
   it 's a country that will fade into the background of history in the next few decades and while new players rise up and have their moment in the sun . 
  and not one of them will be in the middle east or africa . 
   and thats how i can tell your an idiot * you 're you stupid cunt . 
   if you looked at my post history you would have noticed my hatred for al qaeda you revel in the us `` being defeated '' by al qaeda . 
  your hatred for the us far outweighs that of al qaeda . 
   oh and i 'm not going to hold my tongue talking about the shit the uk has pulled . 
  my family has already given it 's blood for the uk so why should i keep my mouth quite ? 
  it 's clear from your posts you have a deep hatred for the country . 
  life is not that bad here , otherwise you would n't remain here would you ? 
  happy bulgarian national unification day !, 
   that 's the gist , really . 
  no it 's not , really . 
   the implication that somebody of foreign extraction necessarily ought to refrain from criticism of their adopted country . 
  1 ) that was not what i implied . 
  2 ) it 's not `` criticism '' when the person in question is notorious for his constant bashing of the uk and its history . 
  when the comments are nonsensical , they cease to be genuine `` criticism '' and instead we must question the motivation as to why they make these comments . 
  that 's all i am doing . 
  adding a suggestion that maybe you should n't ** constantly ** run your adopted home country down when the alternative was a somalian warzone is not in any way bigoted ( as you are rather pathetically insinuating here ) . 
  had you not been so desperate to make your own horrible generalisations about me , you would have read my post from ten minutes before where i quite clearly explained this . 
   yes , op 's probably a bit of a tit - but , what 's to say that they 're not british citizens now ? 
  nothing , what 's to say they 're not a british citizen ? 
  all i know is he was born in somalia , left as a refugee and has lived in european countries . 
  i assume he 's a resident here as he talks about `` us '' as britons . 
  no idea if he 's a citizen or not . 
   they have every bit as much right to waffle inanely about imperialism as you or i. i never tried to take away that right . 
  please refrain from ever claiming to know my '' * attitude * '' in the future . 
  keep your prejudice and stereotypes about the english flag to yourself . 
  glad i could assist in proving you wrong . 
   attitudes like his are the reason i feel intensely awkward whenever i see somebody flying an english flag in lieu of the union jack . 
  please do enlighten me as to what this `` attitude '' i supposedly hold is . 
  this should be interesting . 
  please tell me you 're joking ... 
   why ? 
  they 're british . 
  are they ? 
  he speaks as `` we '' but i 'm not sure . 
   one thing we have pride in is freedom of speech , they are more than free to insult britain where did i suggest otherwise ? 
  i simply stated that i suggest he speak in a more respectful tone . 
  he 's free to continue to bash britain , but it 's absolutely nonsensical to do so and he would be better off without making such childish comments . 
  it seems to be a european phenomenon and never ceases to amaze me the disdain some people fleeing from warzones can hold for their adopted country . 
  i 'm certainly not arguing that people coming to this country do n't have a right to criticise it . 
   i do n't remember blair defending us . 
  so i guess it 's ok to call britain a small island . 
  oh wait , you fell for that stuff about france being america 's best friend again ? 
   we 're running on our historical prestige and the economic advantages we gained from our empire of slavery and genocide . 
  all of our advantages are eroding quickly in the modern era . 
  pretty soon we 'll just be an island with a delusions of grandeur who 's `` we '' ? 
  according to your post history ( which consists of sympathy for al qaeda and other posts bashing the uk ) ** you were born in somalia ** . 
  if you 're speaking about your adopted home , i suggest you should do so in a much more respectful tone . 
   i know other people who feel the same way and would never display the english flag . 
  you 've had this discussion then i take it ? 
  feeling uncomfortable at the sight of an english flag in england . 
  rather pathetic . 
  why the `` england flag particularly '' ? 
  i feel like you 're projecting your own personal thoughts onto others . 
   do you live in a particularly chavvy area ? 
  what 's a chavvy area ? 
  poor people ? 
  i 'm perfectly aware of that . 
  hence why i said :  there are many people who are proud of this country ** and embrace celebrations of it . 
  my neighbour has england flags plastered across the front of their house and nobody is complaining about it . 
  i regularly see them where i live . 
  ** i 'm not sure why uk folks on reddit are so ardent in pushing this viewpoint when it simply is not the truth . 
  what would you consider to be an `` overt nationalist display '' ? 
  jk rowling - harry potter ? 
   are you denying that culturally blatant displays of nationalism are frowned upon ? 
  yes i 'm denying that . 
  there are many people who are proud of this country and embrace celebrations of it . 
  my neighbour has england flags plastered across the front of their house and nobody is complaining about it . 
  i regularly see them where i live . 
  i 've happened to notice it 's always you making this type of comment over and over again . 
   to be fair we think nationalism is weird in the uk as well `` we '' ? 
  who 's `` we '' ? 
  you 're always in threads like these making generalisations about the whole of the uk population ( that is n't true ) . 
   no i mean that they have n't adapted their mindset to the new reality of britain , that we are no longer a super-powerful empire . 
  we 're hardly weak but there are much bigger fish in this pond now . 
  which requires that you cede sovereignty to a supranational organisation ? 
  absolutely not . 
  i also reject all arguments that people have a hangover from the empire . 
   everyone agrees that we need reasonable restrictions on who can come and live here . 
  no they do not . 
  what 's `` reasonable '' ? 
  what you consider reasonable is not what somebody else would consider reasonable . 
   but there 's a spectrum of views on immigration , and far too many people do n't understand the benefits that it has had for us and just want to scrap the whole thing . 
  far too many people do n't understand the negative consequences it has had for this country and are opposed to tighter controls . 
   here 's a tip : if anyone says that decisions are made `` by unelected politicians in brussels '' that means that they do not understand how the eu works . 
  i understand the eu perfectly and there 's nothing unreasonable about that . 
  the majority of people that make decisions in the eu that relate to britain are not elected by the british public . 
  they may be elected by other european nations , but this is of little consequence if you think that we should exit the european union and that british laws should ( mostly ) be determined by british politicians .
