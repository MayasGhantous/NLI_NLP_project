  shows your inability to follow a basic argument . 
  the point i am making is that non-muslims are forced to eat meat blessed by muslims , yet the same is not expected of muslims ( to eat meat blessed in the name of another religion ) . 
  i am not religious . 
  it has no bearing on my life . 
  i am merely pointing out the inconsistency that exists between respecting the rights of muslims ( not to eat meat slaughtered in a way they consider inappropriate ) and the rights of other religious people ( to not eat meat blessed in another religion ) . 
  halal meat is slowly being introduced due to the demands of the islamic population , unbeknownst to most people . 
   do you think straight is an ok word to use ? 
  why not non-gay for straight ? 
  you 're from the school of permanent offence . 
  hence why i said in the name of a god of another religion . 
  i 'm perfectly aware of the history of the abrahamic faiths . 
  try again ... 
  as a non-muslim i do n't care if the meat i eat is halal or non-halal . 
  yet why should a christian eat meat blessed in the name of a god of another religion ? 
  there are far more christians than muslims in denmark . 
  why should the belief of muslims be forced onto christians and not the belief of christians forced onto muslims ? 
   there are bus drivers who bless themselves blessing themselves is not the same as blessing meat that other people are going to eat . 
  slaughter an animal in vishnu 's name and serve it to a muslim . 
  you would never expect them to eat it . 
  yet you expect non-muslims to eat halal meat ? 
   i 'm not religious myself so i do n't care that much for people who make a big fuss over archaic religious rituals - whether for them or against them , like yourself . 
  that 's not what you said . 
  what you said is that it 's non-muslims who get their panties in a bunch when the meat is blessed in allah 's name . 
  i think you 'll find muslims would get just as angsty if they were forced to eat meat blessed in the name of a god of another faith . 
  i am also non-religious , but i do n't think it 's right that a muslim 's demand is catered for yet the same respect not shown to other religious people . 
   there are more important things in the world to get agitated about . 
  then do n't comment . 
   oh , and someone says `` god is greater '' in arabic , which gets a lot of people 's panties up in a bunch . 
  yes , many non-muslims do not like the idea of eating meat that has been blessed in the name of another religion . 
  of course you find it perfectly acceptable to ridicule the views of non-muslims yet afford more respect for the religious views of muslims who insist on eating halal meat . 
  [ john bull ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/john_bull_-_world_war_i_recruiting_poster.jpeg/404px-john_bull_-_world_war_i_recruiting_poster.jpeg )  john bull is a national personification of the united kingdom in general , and england in particular , especially in political cartoons and similar graphic works . 
  he is usually depicted as a stout , middle-aged , country dwelling , jolly , matter-of-fact man . 
  that sounded more like a declaration of war than an attempt to promote world humanitarian day . 
  ownage . 
  and if you do n't know what their motto is , bing it !, 
   we probably stole it from italy , spain ** or an arab country ** of the time during the crusades . 
  it 's not from an arab country . 
  this gentleman over in / r/books gives a [ great explanation ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1k8j3x/george_orwells_letter_on_why_he_wrote_1984/cbmqklh ), 
   that place needs to be disowned disowned by who ? 
  i 'm from england but the arrogance of some english people to look down their nose at northern ireland is astounding , when the very reason that old conflict exists is because of england . 
  what a luxury you have to sit back and trivialise such tensions because you are not directly threatened by them anymore . 
  not to mention the ignorance it takes to look at the small groups of people rioting and to suggest they represent northern ireland , as opposed to the majority of people that do ** not ** riot . 
   i ca n't help if it is an inherently unpopular concept according to the polls or the scots in / r/unitedkingdom it is n't !, 
  you were stupid at the time . 
  not your fault , the result of religious indoctrination . 
  you were stupid at the time ( assuming you were still a jehova 's witness in your adult years ) . 
  if you say racist comments , you are a racist . 
  if you say stupid things , you are stupid . 
  not difficult to grasp at all . 
  idiot is defined as a stupid person . 
  i believe somebody who ignores the right to self-determination of a people fully fits this description . 
  that 's not a personal attack , that 's an analysis of what somebody has said and then passing a judgement on that . 
  it 's still ridiculous to ban him for that language . 
  they could have warned him . 
   wow , you 're an ignorant asshole , are n't ya ? 
  you used the term `` barbaric muzzies '' , not me . 
  so yes i do believe western civilisation should be protected from `` barbaric muzzies '' . 
   noticed in my original comment how i said americas meaning north , central , and south america . 
  because yes , muslims do exist in latin america and they are doing fine . 
  nowhere near the same numbers of europe . 
  not even comparable . 
  lukewarm_dick_sauce is a bit of an idiot but i have no idea why he was banned . 
  it should n't be against the rules to have silly opinions . 
   why ? 
  because british nationalists are stuck with a quaint imperial mentality whereas scottish nationalists just love to hear differing opinions . 
  just go to / r/scotland and read all of the pro-union posts . 
  oh wait , there are none . 
   as a neutral observer , that is astounding to me . 
  you 're not a neutral observer . 
  you firmly believe that spain should have shared sovereignty of gibraltar ( despite over 99 % of gibraltarians being against this ) . 
   yes , we must protect glorious western civilization from the barbaric muzzies : / yes we should . 
   muslims in the americas seem to be doing fine and we 're not losing our cultures over here . 
  larger country , smaller number of muslims dispersed over a wider area of land . 
   maybe europe should reevaluate its immigration policy because right now yes it should . 
  i think in the long run the french are protecting a greater freedom , which is the freedom for women to grow up and not have to cover their entire bodies because of religious indoctrination . 
  is this an ideal law ? 
  absolutely not . 
  yet the growth of islam in our society is fundamentally changing the landscape of europe for the worse , and certain measures have to be taken to protect western civilisation . 
  a 5 year old also ? 
  psychopaths . 
   is it really unheard of that some people wear these particular articles of clothing out of their own volition and their own religious conviction ? 
  if you had a nation of people that were not forced into religious indoctrination , then it would certainly be vary rare indeed . 
   they 've already ceded their sovereignty to uk . 
  no they have ceded their foreign relations and defense to the united kingdom government . 
  it governs its own affairs . 
   shared sovereignty would not change much then there 's no need for it . 
  spain just needs to accept the wishes of the people of gibraltar . 
   you have to admit that it 's pretty sly on gibraltar part to drop 70 concrete blocks at the beginning of the neutral buffer zone . 
  spanish vessels are wrecking the eco system in gibraltarian waters . 
  nothing sly about that . 
   looking back , in 2002 the gibraltarians rejected a joint uk-spanish proposal for shared sovereignty , so i 'm not very sympathetic to their problems . 
  there 's absolutely no logic in that at all and you should be ashamed for ignoring the right to self-determination that those people have . 
  no population should be coerced into ceding their sovereignty . 
  what a ridiculous suggestion . 
  read the article . 
   the settlements contravene the fourth geneva convention 's ban on an occupying power moving its nationals into occupied territory but are seen by right-wing israelis as an expression of historic jewish rights to the biblically resonant areas of judea and samaria . 
  about half a million israelis have moved to the west bank , which palestinians view as the heartland of their future state , since its capture during the 1967 war . 
  this gives me faith in the eu . 
  fyi  default-on is a system whereby internet service providers block access to pornographic images as standard , unless the customer opts out of the filters . 
  in the eyes of certain newspapers , it is the silver bullet solution to the problem of kids watching pornography .
