  but , for various reasons , most of the major isps are not up for asking their customers : `` do you want porn with that ? '', 
  they have negotiated with the government and agreed on a system called `` active choice + '' in which customers opt in for filters , rather than out for falling bras . 
  the system gives new users a choice at installing filters , and existing customers the option of switching to safer browser modes . 
  ** the default setting remains filter-free . 
  it 's not even worth discussion . 
  scotland will vote to remain in the uk , yet the constant whining and blame culture that exists there will continue to thrive . 
   wish we could have a referendum in the rest of the uk to just abandon n.ireland . 
  why is this shit being upvoted ? 
  we should do the same in the uk . 
   also , i stand by my `` we '' . 
  the unionist community in ni is undeniably more patriotic and obsessed with being `` british '' than the people who live on great britain are . 
  and the republican community is more obsessed with being irish than the people that live in the republic of ireland . 
  this is because both groups feel that their identity is at stake . 
  this does n't make either of their identities false . 
   as for saying the `` unionists in northern ireland are n't as irish as people in the republic of ireland '' , it 's basically because it 's nonsensical it 's not nonsensical when an idiot says `` we see no difference between you all '' . 
  that is absolute ignorance and that was what i was responding to . 
  northern ireland remains a part of the united kingdom until the people of northern ireland decide otherwise . 
  i can assure you will_homes does not speak for the majority of people in britain . 
   here on great britain , we 're nowhere near as patriotic * you 're nowhere near as patriotic . 
  there 's lots of `` we '' discussion in this thread which does n't represent a general view of the population , but rather is a left-wing reddit view that typically sympathises with the republicans . 
  * some * unionists burn irish flags . 
  * some * republicans burn union flags . 
  i 've been downvoted for saying that the unionists in northern ireland are n't as irish as people in the republic of ireland . 
  how the fuck is that an incorrect view ? 
   no one cares about northern ireland in the uk rubbish . 
  i find it pretty disgusting how this thread has basically turned into an excuse to ridicule the unionist population of northern ireland because of a few idiots . 
   does it drive these people crazy that as an english british person i see them just as much irish as people from the republic ? 
  suggesting that unionists are as irish as people from the republic shows an overwhelming amount of ignorance in regards to history . 
  i see it all too often . 
  where 's the british/english flag for `` goodbye '' ? 
  you can express that opinion . 
  i ca n't express mine without being downvoted . 
  it 's pathetic . 
  that 's not playing devil 's advocate . 
  that 's merely pointing out a truth . 
  a. geographical . 
  term . 
  it 's also a nationality which will completely supercede the use of the word as a geographical term . 
  people will associate * british * with the activities of the british people ( england/wales/ni etc ) . 
  scottish people will not be referred to as british and will look ridiculous trying to associate themselves with a ** different nationality ** . 
   just as all people in norway , denmark , sweden and finland are scandinavian this is where your logic fails you . 
  there is no scandinavian nationality . 
  if norwegians and swedes were in a personal union whereby their nationality was `` scandinavian '' , people would not refer to danes as scandinavians . 
  you can say that denmark was geographically a part of scandinavia , but they would not refer to themselves as scandinavian 's and the activities of the danish people would be referred to as `` danish '' . 
   the full name of the uk is `` the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland '' . 
  the ` great britain ' part refers to the largest island in the british isles , the one that holds england , scotland and wales , scotland would still be on ` great britain ' post-independence yes i learned that in year 1 . 
  you 're failing to understand the point . 
   it 's not like we 're sawing ourselves off from the island . 
  even then , the other parts , ( ireland , the hebrides , orkney , shetland , the isle of mann etc ) are still british because they 're part of the british isles . 
  but you are seperating politically from the rest of the british people , that includes a huge part of the british identity . 
   to further reiterate this point ; the term `` british '' existed long before the union of crowns or the act of union . 
  it 's origins lie in the greek word priteni ( the origin of the latin word britannic ) which was used to refer to the people of great britain and ireland by both the greeks and the romans . 
  nobody is disputing that it 's a geographical or historical term . 
  we 're disputing scotland 's ability to hold onto a british identity when there will already be a british identity ... held by british citizens ( people from the uk of england , wales and northern ireland ) . 
  if the uk was to break up entirely , then of course british identity would mean something else . 
  it would then be used to refer to the countries of britain , their surrounding islands and cultural activities yet british people will still exist as a national group which the scots will not be a part of . 
  you 're completely deluded if you genuinely believe scottish people will continue to refer to themselves as british . 
   a lot of people do n't realise the british empire is dead not this shit again ... 
   the only reason the irish do n't like to be called british is because of past history between them and great britain . 
  also the fact that they are irish nationals , not british nationals ( as is often mistaken by people outside of the uk and ireland ) . 
  if scotland goes independent , the scots will be scottish nationals . 
  the people of england/wales/ni and other overseas territories would be british citizens . 
  the citizens of an independent scotland will not refer to themselves as british at all . 
  it 's ridiculous to assume that they can maintain that identity simply because their independent state is on the island of britain . 
   i think the united republic of ireland , scotland , wales and northern england would probably work out pretty well , actually . 
  not as well as the rest of england on its own . 
  have you ever thought about making a video on the euro crisis ? 
  your videos are great . 
   oh no davis , you do n't get to pick and choose when you think the eu might be a good idea and when not . 
  yes he does . 
  the eu should be scrutinized by people from all ends of the political spectrum to try and weigh up its advantages and disadvantages . 
   you two faced prick do n't get so emotional !, 
   i wonder why bbc gives space to attention seeking whores like him , though . 
  he was the leader of a group the terrorist joined . 
  they can both be seen [ here ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/05/25/article-2330689-19f656e0000005dc-670_634x355.jpg ) together . 
  i agree there 's no need for him to be on tv at such a sensitive time . 
  here 's a picture of anjem before he turned [ radical ] ( http://www.sunray22b.net/images/anjem_choudary_3.jpg ), 
  that 's not what he was suggesting at all . 
  i 'm perfectly aware of the quote . 
  i 'm just wondering why it 's being used in this context ? 
  especially as he thinks the uk leaving the eu makes it weaker . 
   there are a lot of people in england who have n't yet realised the sun set a long time ago what does this mean ? 
   all that 's left is a rainy , overcrowded island propping up a tax haven/financial trading hub . 
  yes britain is a terrible place to live ...  i live in britain oh ... so not that terrible then ? 
   or having them leave , collapse , and come back willingly , the latter is probably better for everybody in the long term . 
  yes we would collapse without the european union . 
  the eu is the only thing preventing us from complete collapse right now . 
  the real question is can france survive ** with ** hollande ? 
  most people on / r/scotland are pro independence and socialist . 
  i think whichever way you look at it , a politician should not need police escort from a pub simply for claiming there should be less immigration to the uk . 
  why are they calling him scum ? 
  greatly unfair in my opinion . 
  i 'm not a ukip supporter but nigel farage certainly has n't done anything to warrant such abuse . 
  so nothing . 
  do n't get so defensive . 
  the quote was said way over a hundred years ago when being born english was like winning first prize in the lottery of life . 
  not that it 's bad , it just matters less . 
  being born in canada for example is no different to being born in england now . 
  for some context ... cecil rhodes died in 1902 lol . 
  it 's not racist at all .
