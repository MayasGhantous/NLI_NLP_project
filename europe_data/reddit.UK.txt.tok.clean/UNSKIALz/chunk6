  i can tell you first hand - merkel and her disastrous policy scuppered public opinion on the eu completely and utterly . 
  do n't be like that to vlad !, 
  a-are you implying we could die of starvation later ? 
  honest question : * would * greece be better off ? 
  historically they were doing better than today , right ? 
  i suppose it has to do with a belief that non-uk entities deciding uk law is n't `` independence '' sad that i have to say this but : do n't shoot the messenger , just making a reasonable assumption as to his / her motivations, 
  top comments with ~ 100 points :  vive l'europe  vive l'europe f\u00e9d\u00e9rale !, 
  equal but opposite opinion , with more substance : -10 points talk about bias . 
  stop encouraging this bubble mentality and downvoting * opinions you disagree with * . 
  it 's unhealthy for discussion . 
  anything is possible after 2016 , i 'd be careful about ruling stuff out ... 
  oh no i agree , it 's accelerated growth and it 's good to see romania and others closing the gap ( they soon will completely , growth is massive ) i just fear that politicians put * fast * growth over the stability of the bloc . 
  maybe it 's just because i 'm from the uk , but i 'm disappointed we left and i ca n't help but feel romania 's growth would be inevitable anyway if different pillars / benefits of the eu were implemented slowly over time until her economy was close up with the west . 
  * then * add free movement , and bam - no mass immigration , uk stays in , far right movements across europe do n't get as much traction , etc. 
  a bit of patience would have been win win in my eyes . 
  but what 's happened has happened . 
  i live in ni and we 're still a developing economy somewhat . 
  i hope we reach growth someday like you guys have , but brexit is certainly going to make that tougher short term at least . 
  i 've been thinking on this for a while and i 'd like to put my theory out there ( feel free to agree / disagree of course ) i think this is very much due to a developing economy being granted free movement with developed ones imo . 
  the movement is very much one-way from eastern europe and sadly laid the foundations for a uk exit . 
  many like to point to the uk as bigoted over brexit , but there 's a reason germany , france , italy etc. 
  did n't really rub the uk public the wrong way . 
  movement between developed economies is very much a more equal affair . 
  decisions like the one taken in 04 were n't mistakes in concept , but they were big mistakes in terms of timing . 
  the eastern economies should have had more time to develop before lumping them in with a whole different league table . 
  would have certainly lead to a more stable eu . 
  think about it - for all the eastern europeans who move to the west , who * really * decides to move to the east ? 
   there is not much we can do at the moment to change that why not ? 
  i fear the uk 's decision to leave was based on this attitude being prevalent in brussels . 
  i really want to see the eu tackle this decisively , and act against opportunists . 
   the democratic majority want to ** close the borders to foreigners ** language is a little misleading there . 
  they want to ** reduce ** immigration ( currently a third of a million per year ) ending free movement is a ** normalisation ** of immigration policy , consistent with the rest of the world . 
  i fear thar turkey has long since veered off the road of progress . 
   neither german or polish economy has sinked there was a deadline ? 
  ehm ... because ni democratically prefers being in the uk . 
  simple as that . 
  most here would be against leaving ( look at any polling data ) . 
  the republic forcing us otherwise , * that * would be occupation . 
  after crimea , they 're not far off . 
  spain 's position shocked me , not going to lie . 
  i reckon a part of it is the needs of highly condensed populations vs smaller , more spread out groups . 
  the latter may have less issues in common given they live in very different regions per 10 people . 
  china 's biggest concern is moral decline . 
  things must be pretty comfy over there, 
  exactly !, 
  that 's why it 's so unusual !, 
  the needs and policy demands of urban areas may act against the interests of those in rural areas , and vice versa . 
  they are different ways of life and a balance between the two is only smart given demographic trends . 
  scotland uses * roman * law ? 
  where * is * their sense of banter , honestly ? 
  i think the electoral college is a good idea . 
  prevents tyranny of the dense urban areas , and iirc was one of the reasons many rural states decided joining the union would n't be a bad idea . 
  come on austria !, 
  where 's your sense of banter ? 
  this guy is a meme of an opposition leader . 
  things like this are exactly why he 's unelectable here, 
  what 's the highest value ? 
  does n't southern europe have some rates much higher than 20 % ? 
  do n't even know what to say . 
  this is disgusting . 
  ah , that one, 
  never too late , considering the strength of a pro-eu uk and the eu combined . 
  these things should not be brushed off and forgotten . 
  there 's talk of poland leaving , we have to ensure this does not become a fact of life of the eu . 
  i do n't want unification . 
  i want both of us in europe :( a very difficult time for pro-union , pro-eu citizens in ni . 
  what a mess . 
  i 've been considering e-mailing an mep or commissioner since the brexit vote , this seems like a great opportunity to do so . 
  i mainly just want to communicate how strongly i feel about the project since northern ireland will be taken out with the rest of the uk . 
  it 's done a lot for us and i fear i was complacent about that growing up . 
  okay , lem me know when he e-mails you back saying he 's finished it . 
  i 'll send mine in after : ^ ), 
  i fear brexit will be a major geopolitical disaster for the uk , europe , and the west in general . 
  united we stand , divided we fall and so forth ... 
  i hope so . 
  yes, 
  i 'd remain weary . 
  people still took the daily mail as news over here ... 
  the olympics / diamond jubilee were a golden age culturally for the uk . 
  where did it go so wrong ? 
  and this is relevant in a football match , why ? 
  seems like a way to sow division and weaken europe . 
  it is in europe 's best interest to work together as one entity . 
  an eu fighting against this kind of anti-european evil would be incredibly effective . 
  the problem is n't the eu structure ( united we stand , etc. . . ) , the problem is with the politicians at the top . 
  there needs to be a systematic change in attitude without compromising the european common interest . 
  i think so , and reported it as such . 
  he described native scots as `` inbred spawn '' and expressed desire to see them die out . 
  it was simply a racist video , i struggle to see any way around it . 
  calling scots `` inbreds '' and denouncing white history / culture . 
  this is not the equality we were promised - instead , this video encourages the pendulum swinging to the other extreme . 
  incredibly , deeply unsettling . 
   how long should that transitional phase be ? 
  until gdp per capita is within reasonable parity . 
  to your second point , i sympathise and would have been in favour of measures to mitigate such imbalance . 
  i hope you understand , i 'm seeing this from the point of view of a europhile who 's own country is removing itself from the union . 
  i 'm * extremely * regretful and saddened over this development , and simply wish the uk had experienced a positive public reaction around immigration from eastern europe . 
  this would have involved actions at both the uk and eu level , such as ensuring that the numbers coming in were comparable to western european rates that produced stable membership in prior years . 
  to go from that , to the rapid increase post-2004 , it was a destabilising force in uk politics i fear . 
  were the people justified in feeling that way ?
