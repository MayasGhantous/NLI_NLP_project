incorporating yearly page views for 2016 does seem to reduce the bias towards sport and controversy , but it also significantly increases the bias towards british people . 
  the top 100 list now looks like : * uk [ 49 ] : david bowie , elizabeth ii , andy murray , diana , princess of wales , winston churchill , william shakespeare , paul mccartney , john lennon , stephen hawking , david beckham , margaret thatcher , henry viii of england , george michael , elizabeth i of england , george harrison , queen victoria , tony blair , charlie chaplin , adele , wayne rooney , charles , prince of wales , isaac newton , amy winehouse , boris johnson , j. k. rowling , alan turing , emma watson , phil collins , prince william , duke of cambridge , eric clapton , charles darwin , kate winslet , daniel radcliffe , j. r. r. tolkien , audrey hepburn , elton john , ozzy osbourne , christopher nolan , charles dickens , mary , queen of scots , gareth bale , lewis hamilton , george orwell , frank lampard , ringo starr , catherine , duchess of cambridge , charles i of england , keira knightley , christian bale * germany [ 8 ] : adolf hitler , albert einstein , karl marx , michael schumacher , pope benedict xvi , friedrich nietzsche , martin luther , erwin rommel * italy [ 7 ] : christopher columbus , leonardo da vinci , julius caesar , benito mussolini , gianluigi buffon , galileo galilei , augustus * russia [ 6 ] : vladimir putin , joseph stalin , maria sharapova , vladimir lenin , ayn rand , nicholas ii of russia * austria [ 5 ] : adolf hitler , arnold schwarzenegger , sigmund freud , marie antoinette , wolfgang amadeus mozart * france [ 4 ] : napoleon , zinedine zidane , louis xiv of france , thierry henry * greece [ 4 ] : alexander the great , prince philip , duke of edinburgh , aristotle * portugal [ 2 ] : cristiano ronaldo , jos\u00e9 mourinho * serbia [ 2 ] : novak djokovic , nikola tesla * spain [ 2 ] : rafael nadal , fernando torres * switzerland [ 2 ] : roger federer , albert einstein * albania [ 1 ] : mother teresa * belgium [ 1 ] : audrey hepburn * croatia [ 1 ] : nikola tesla * georgia [ 1 ] : joseph stalin * iceland [ 1 ] : bobby fischer * ireland [ 1 ] : oscar wilde * macedonia [ 1 ] : mother teresa * netherlands [ 1 ] : vincent van gogh * poland [ 1 ] : pope john paul ii * sweden [ 1 ] : zlatan ibrahimovic * turkey [ 1 ] : recep tayyip erdogan * ukraine [ 1 ] : mila kunis next step is probably to incorporate other wikipedias . 
  well culturally he was certainly low countries : he spoke french and dutch fluently , learning some spanish and german only later in life . 
  given the extent of his domain i guess you could claim him for many places ( he was also king of italy ) but belgium seems to have the strongest claim imo . 
  lol, 
  skanderbeg and hoxha were both missing ( one due to wikipedia , the other a bug in my script ) . 
  they should be # 2 and # 3 . 
  mother teresa is presumably in the fyrom list since she was born in skopje , even though it was part of the kosovo vilayet at the time . 
  good idea . 
  chinese and japanese are two options , as both have large wikipedias and reasonably spread diasporas . 
  still i expect there will be biases everywhere . 
  who else did you expect out of interest ( other than perhaps maria curie ) ? 
  looking into it further it looks like it might not have been a totally fair comparison . 
  nightwish was listed under each individual member , while potf linked directly to the band since most members did n't have a separate article . 
  sel\u00e4nne is actually # 7 , after karja . 
  litmanen is around # 15 , below hyypi\u00e4 , h\u00e4kkinen and various others . 
  ooh that 's exciting !, 
  did n't realise they exposed that . 
  though i wonder whether that too might have a strong currently-active bias ( or at least , recently-deceased bias ) . 
  i 'll take a look ... 
  not quite : the most famous irish person amongst wikipedia editors . 
  not the same thing :-), 
  he got icelandic citizenship in 2005 and lived there until his death . 
  stalin was counted as both georgian ( birthplace , ethnicity ) and russian ( where he lived his adult life ) . 
  i only missed the georgian flag off the top 100 as i could n't figure out how to superimpose it nicely . 
  i 'd never heard of sheamus either . 
  i guess it reflects the us bias of wikipedia ( he 's a wwe champion ) . 
  henry , joyce , yeats , etc do rank highly ; however there 's a clear bias towards living people . 
  that 's why i did the some dead europeans graphics , though since these required manual filtering i did n't do it for every country . 
  the top deceased irish entries after saint patrick were shackleton , heaney , joyce , yeats , robert boyle and bram stoker . 
  ali pasha was # 7 , isa boletini around # 15 . 
  hoxha would indeed be # 2 ( or # 3 behind skanderbeg who got filtered out by mistake ) . 
  i 'll add him when i make my updates . 
  canadian writer born in moglic\u00eb and american actress born in tirana . 
  since this is based off english wikipedia they edge out people like edi rama and ismail kadare . 
  it 's a bit unfortunate . 
  less controversial norwegians such as nansen , ibsen and amundsen are just outside the top five . 
  looks like he accidentally got filtered out during the scraping !, 
  he should be # 2 at 88 % , just behind mother teresa ( and not far outside the top 100 europe-wide ) . 
  i 'll add him next time i update to fix errors !, 
  because apart from being archduchess of austria she was also queen of france and lived in france for all of her adult life . 
  grew up in brussels , so a denizen rather than a citizen i guess . 
  thanks . 
  a fun side project to teach myself more python . 
  lewis was certainly irish !, 
  he just was n't from ( the territory of ) the modern day republic of ireland , which is what this list is about . 
  though i expect that if he lived today he would have had dual citizenship , like many northern irish . 
  she did grow up in russia , moving to the us only at age 20 . 
  the fame measure is somewhat biased towards controversy . 
  i 'm trying to figure out how to counterbalance that . 
  nansen is # 8 . 
  the king is # 9 . 
  ibsen a surprisingly low # 10 . 
  the names are all from the wikipedia articles , which are ( usually ) the name the person is best known as in english . 
  not ideal , i know . 
  wilde is # 2 . 
  bono is # 7 . 
  lewis is northern irish rather than republic . 
  many of the rest are irish-american rather than irish ( the list is geographic rather than ethnic ) . 
  i 'm hoping it 's partly an artifact of the metric : living people naturally get more edits on their pages . 
  still depressing though ... 
  it uses the name of the english wikipedia article , which is the main name the person is known under in english . 
  i guess i could translate each name using the relevant language wikipedia ( portuguese in this case ) ... 
  he 's # 10 ( and # 6 among the dead italians , including ancient romans ) . 
  though i agree that he should be ranked higher . 
  btw , the top 10 modern greeks ( excluding prince philip ) are elena paparizou , georgios samaras , anna vissi , maria callas , sakis rouvas , vassilis spanoulis , yanni , vangelis , george papandreou and arianna huffington . 
  :-) i 've clarified my point slightly . 
  the list is aiming to be primarily geographic rather than ethnic , but in some cases that 's rather difficult . 
  copernicus appears on the both the polish and german wikipedia lists . 
  but yes , i know that the latter is controversial ... 
  worth adding that despite being born in greece he never actually spoke greek since he left the country aged 18 months . 
  queen sof\u00eda of spain on the other hand does speak some greek i believe . 
  there 's an entire section on arguments about copernicus 's nationality [ on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicolaus_copernicus#nationality ) . 
  also ko\u015bciuszko was born in what is now belarus , which i guess is why he 's included in wikipedia 's list of belarusians . 
  at least both are also included in the polish page ( just spotted that marie antoinette is listed under austria but not france ) . 
  fixed the flags on the imgur page . 
  fixed the flags on the imgur page . 
  well this is english-language wikipedia . 
  would be interesting to compare with french or german . 
  oops !, 
  another wiki fail that i really should have caught . 
  oops !, 
  another wiki fail that i really should have caught . 
  the fame metric is purely a combination of article length and number of edits . 
  while this does a pretty good job at distinguishing really famous people from much less noteworthy ones , it 's very far from perfect . 
  arvo p\u00e4rt is actually # 7 for estonia ( behind paul keres at # 6 ) . 
  the names are automatically generated from the list of serbs/montenegrin/slovenes / etc pages . 
  sadly these are n't always very accurate . 
  i 'll try to clean up any more errors that people spot . 
  for some reason the wikipedia page `` flag of romania '' has as its default image the flag of the united principalities of romania rather than the modern flag !, 
  i should have really caught that and fixed it when i made the graphic , sorry !, 
  yup . 
  methinks the fame metric is a bit too biased towards controversial fucktards . 
  automatically generated from english-language wikipedia , based on the various `` list of [ nationality ] '' lists and using a combination of article length and number of revisions as the fame metric . 
  obvious language bias , as well as a bias towards living and controversial figures . 
  for more details , see [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5zxl1c/the_most_famous_europeans_according_to_wikipedia/df1t7at/ ) . 
  ** errata ** : romanian and macedonian flags are wrong ( i ** really ** should have caught those , sorry ! ) . 
  tito is geographically croatian , not slovenian ( ethnically , he 's a mix ) . 
  probably many others , since this was automatically generated . 
  may fix up any i know about in a few days .
