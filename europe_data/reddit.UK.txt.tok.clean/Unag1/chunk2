  originated as a socialist movement ; lenin actually wrote an article about them before he took over russia , calling them a bourgious , fake worker 's organisation !, 
  also once had a substantial trotskyist wing in the 80s who were purged . 
  took a right turn and became tory-lite with blair 's election in the 90s ; now undergoing a leadership election . 
  the leading candidate , jeremy corbyn , may move the party back to the left . 
  ** liberal democrats ** : centre , though it 's hard to say what they stand for these days . 
  formerly the party of classical liberalism , the tory coalition did massive damage to their reputation . 
  ** ukip : ** bloody immigrants !, 
  ukip are like the old , thatcher-era tory party on steroids , and like many of the far-right parties in europe , blame most things on bloody immigrants and/or the bloody eu . 
  that said , they 're not really far-right ; their origin is n't in a fascist movement , but an anti-eu one , their platform is strong civic nationalism and a ruthlessly free-market economic policy ( formerly , at least ; they 're trying to lure in dissilusioned labour voters ) . 
  ** greens ** : mad , mad , mad . 
  they want to pay everyone in the country a `` citizen 's income '' and have no real understanding of economics . 
  their leader famously froze up in an interview when asked basic questions on their economic policies . 
  beyond that , they 're very pro-environment ( duh ! ) . 
  ** bnp ** : literally literally hitler . 
  seemed to be gaining some popular support 5 years ago , but ukip took ther jerbs as the anti-immigration party last election and they lost 98 % of their support . 
  * someone * has to keep the french in check, 
  iirc the victoria line is practically automated already . 
  only reason it has drivers is because of the rmt . 
  since a pack of fags here costs around # 8.50 ( $ 12 ) it 's not surprising we 're among the lowest . 
  most of my friends simply never started because it 's such an expensive habit . 
  indeed , ireland has always benefitted from being in a union with us . 
  biggest culprits for us are the tube drivers . 
  here you head to ` spoons with kev and callum ( proper ledge ! ),

  at least on sky , the filters are dns-based . 
  you can get around it by changing your dns to a third-party one . 
  mmmm ... burger, 
  there are three main ethnic groups who traditionally live in bosnia : serbs , croats , and bosniaks ( who used to be called `` muslims '' ) . 
  a bosnian serb or bosnian croat is an ethnic serb or croat who comes from bosnia . 
  obviously all of them are actually muhammad ( even the girls ) and the lefty liblabcon cultural marxist bbc is obscuring the truth !, 
  this is the start of wwiii !, 
  we 're all doomed , i tells ya !, 
  i call them `` anteuromaneaus '',

  [ i ca n't see it on my map . 
  they do n't fly to syria , they fly to turkey then get a bus to the border . 
  makes it harder to prove they were there . 
  i agree . 
  all posts should be made in all 24 languages of the european union . 
  there are employed cleaners near the arc de triomphe and there are also tourists with digesting problems in the area . 
  do you see any problem if tourists are solving their problems bellow the arc and workers are doing their jobs afterward ? 
  it 's impossible to be racist against the * danskjavlar * danelaw nevr 4get,

  since hungarians are from mongolia they feel they need something like the great wall to the south to make them feel at home .

  i learned it by watching you !, 
  the first comment in this thread is basically `` too late , sweden is doooooomed ! '', 
  you 're right . 
  now we just need to deal with those maltese ... 
   due the low ammount of native groups that lived on the area they , erm , went on a very long holiday !, 
  from the ussr, 
  mission accomplished !, 
  lots of refugees , i 'd reckon . 
  they probably just declared their homeland as `` bosnia '' and that was it . 
  `` yugoslavia '' also probably refers to immigrants from serbia and montenegro as well as sfry . 
  norway and finland will partition sweden , poland-style . 
  it 's different here . 
  romani look south asian , and we have far more indians/pakistanis here so discrimination is n't on looks .
