   if we recognized territorial claims from 1415 , then i guess sizeable portions of france should be given to the english monarch . 
  sounds fine to me .

  lots of them are kurds though, 
  britain has not only apologised for its actions during the empire , but it 's also not state policy to deny these things happened . 
  i could give a speech in westminster square calling the bengal famine a genocide , but in turkey speaking out about the armenian genocide is prosecutable as `` insulting turkishness '' .

  the taliban think that the vaccines are part of a conspiracy to sterilise muslims rather than opposing them on specific religious grounds .

  most muslims in the uk are from pakistan and bangladesh , with a sizeable minority from africa ( mostly somalia ) . 
  we do n't have many immigrants from the middle east , muslim or christian , so i ca n't really comment on that . 
  immigrants from the west indies tend to integrate easily and are predominantly christian , though african immigrants have a larger cultural barrier .

  lots ( maybe even most ) of radicalisation happens outside the mosque ; young people end up on extreme websites , a friend passes around leaflets in school , they might have people with radical views in their family etc. 
  that being said , there needs to be more investigation into where the money and preachers for these mosques are coming from . 
  new mosques in the uk are often funded by deobandi/salafist organisations and individuals , and often have preachers who have been trained in one of those ideological madrassas .

  `` slavic '' is a linguistic/cultural group , not a genetic one .

  `` wait , so you guys created the cyrillic alphabet ? 
  so why do you use the russian one ? '', 
  it is according to many definitions ( all of which are fuzzy ) .
