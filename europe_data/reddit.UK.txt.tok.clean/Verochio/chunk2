  anyway , i think i 've stretched that metaphor too far . 
  edit : spelling . 
   they claim they have somehow protected national security by destroying the copies in the london branch , but leaving the multiple other copies in other countries , branches and people intact . 
  to quote nick clegg 's office from [ this article ] ( http://www.libdemvoice.org/some-more-on-the-reasoning-behind-nick-cleggs-approval-of-the-35827.html )  there may be other sites where this information is held but where the government has the opportunity to prevent information of this nature from being held insecurely , it has a duty to act . 
  they knew that destroying only one copy will not wipe out the threat . 
  it will , however , reduce it . 
   british people of reddit , name this : i do n't recognise exactly what that is . 
  if it 's sweet i 'd go with `` bun '' , if it 's savoury i 'd go with `` cob '' or `` bread roll '' . 
   labor unions are the mirror image of shareholder meetings . 
  not when unions are industry wide rather than company wide . 
  then they are the mirror image of an industry cartel . 
  from where i sit it 's you with the `` fuck everyone else '' attitude . 
  you 're so focused on a portion of the population who are struggling to fight their own corner that you 're willing to impose draconian laws on everybody else . 
  the solution to this problem , as i see it , is to find ways of increasing the options and freedom of those who are struggling to get the life they want , not to reduce the freedom of everyone else . 
  if you do n't like your pay and conditions , then the normal thing to do is to leave for another employer . 
  if that 's not possible then that 's the problem we should be addressing by ensuring there is always somewhere else to go and that it 's easy to move . 
  tackling things like unemployment and lack of jobs by encouraging jobs creation , especially in the regions . 
  access to skills training . 
  access to student loans which are never unaffordable to repay . 
  the competition commission ensuring employers are not acting like cartels on pay and conditions , and are actually competing for staff . 
  also , where are unions in all this ? 
  i 'm sorry , i have n't had time to watch that documentary before replying , but i do think that nhs management have a duty to ensure the best patient care , which includes ensuring staff are well rested enough . 
  if they are not doing that then that 's a problem with the nhs management system . 
  i have no problem with the nhs having an internal working hours limit , and we the public -- who are the ultimate employers -- should be good employers and ensure it happens if it raises the standard of patient care . 
  but that choice should be at the national level of the nhs , not the eu imposing it unilaterally from above . 
  yes the working time directive is negative because it 's illiberal . 
  it 's an authoritarian and patronisingly paternalistic imposition of restrictive rules on people 's lives . 
  it 's a set of handcuffs `` for your own good '' . 
  no thanks , i 'll decide what 's for my own good , not the state , nor the eu . 
  i work 50 hours a week , and that 's cool with me . 
  that 's what it takes to do my job . 
  i do n't see why anyone should be able to stop me from doing that . 
  if medical staff are working too many hours to be fully capable at their jobs then that is a matter for the managers in the nhs who are responsible for delivering quality patient care . 
  it 's nothing to do with the eu . 
  i think what makes a huge impact is the velarization of both english dark l and soft d , and the fact they are both approximants . 
  as i 've said up-thread , i think it 's very similar to the japanese l/r thing . 
  english speakers find it difficult to hear the difference between dark l and soft d , but find the difference between soft d and voiced th very easy . 
  whilst danish speakers find the difference between dark l and soft d easy , but struggle to hear the difference between soft d and voiced th . 
  they do sound very different . 
  for a closer comparison , try to compare your pronunciation of the english word hither with the danish word hedde . 
  i know the first vowel is n't exactly the same , but i ca n't think of a better pair to choose of the top of my head . 
  i 'm really intrigued as to why you think it is n't alveolar , when my danish danish teacher and the nice people over at / r/linguistics think it is ? 
  your tongue does not touch the alveolar ridge , but it is where the ( almost middle ) of the tongue comes closest to the roof of your mouth , and hence where the airflow is most restricted . 
  no it sounds very very different . 
  i do n't know why so many people think this , because they sound obviously very different . 
  in english th the tip of the tongue is tight in behind the top teeth , the back of the tongue is neutral and the gap is small enough to cause turbulent airflow . 
  in the danish soft d , the tip of the tongue is almost behind the bottom teeth , the air is flowing between the middle of the tongue and the alveolar ridge just behind your teeth , but the gap is n't small enough for the airflow to be turbulent , and the back of the tongue is lifted . 
   the d is the `` th '' in `` that '' . 
  this is n't true . 
  i do n't know why so many people think this , because they sound obviously very different . 
  in english th the tip of the tongue is tight in behind the top teeth , the back of the tongue is neutral and the gap is small enough to cause turbulent airflow . 
  in the danish soft d , the tip of the tongue is almost behind the bottom teeth , the air is flowing between the middle of the tongue and the alveolar ridge just behind your teeth , but the gap is n't small enough for the airflow to be turbulent , and the back of the tongue is lifted . 
  your tongue is n't near or touching the roof of your mouth . 
  it just comes * closest * to the roof of the mouth at that point , so that 's the point where the airflow is the most constricted . 
  in contrast , in the english th the tongue is very tight up against the back of the teeth . 
  i 'm not just making this stuff up ; i 'm just telling you what the entire danish linguistics community , every text book , every danish professor etc. 
  will tell you . 
  so the english th has the tongue close to the back of the teeth ( dental ) , and is close enough that it creates turbulent airflow ( fricative ) . 
  the back of the tongue is neutral . 
  the danish soft d has the tongue closest to the ridge just behind the teeth ( alveolar ) . 
  the gap has air flowing through it but is n't quite small enough that it creates turbulent airflow ( approximant ) . 
  at the same time the back of the tongue is raised ( velarized ) and so the place of the airflow is further back in the mouth ( retracted ) . 
  in l the tongue is also closest to the mouth at the ridge just behind your teeth ( alveolar ) but the airflow is not between the roof of the mouth and the tongue ( they actually touch ) , but around the sides of the tongue ( lateral ) , but again the gap is n't narrow enough to create turbulent airflow ( approximant ) . 
  in the english dark l the back of the tongue is also raised towards to the roof of the mouth ( velarized ) . 
  so , the th and soft d share the fact that they are sounds made by airflow going between the tongue and the roof of the mouth . 
  but in one the airflow is turbulent and the other not , in one the back of the tongue is raised and the other not , and the front of the tongue is also in a slightly different place . 
  the dark l and soft d both have the front of the tongue closest to the mouth at the ridge behind your teeth , both have the back of the tongue raised , and in neither is the airflow turbulent . 
  they differ in that with one the air flows around the side of the tongue , but with the other the air flows between the tongue and the roof of the mouth . 
  honestly , i think it 's a lot like the japanese l and r thing , where a japanese person ca n't hear the difference between l and r , but an english speaker can . 
  the english speaker struggles to hear the difference between the english dark l and the danish soft d. whilst the danish speaker struggles to hear the difference between the danish soft d and the english th . 
  we are , in fact , both wrong . 
  they are three separate sounds . 
   the soft d in danish is exactly the same sound as `` th '' in `` them '' in english no , it is n't . 
  the th in english * them * is a voiced dental fricative . 
  the danish soft d is a velarized alveolar retracted approximant , they are different sounds . 
  as i understand it the confusion lies in the fact that english has two `` allophones '' , or sounds , that we use for the letter * l * which are somewhat interchangeable to the point that most english speakers do not realise that they exist . 
  one is called * clear l * ( as is `` lip '' ) the other is * dark l * ( as in `` bell '' ) . 
  in fact many english accents only use * dark l * . 
  danish only ever uses * clear l * . 
  whereas it is the * dark l * sound -- which danish does n't use but english does -- that actually sounds very much like * soft d * . 
  to use phonetic descriptions * clear l * is a alveolar lateral approximant * dark l * is a velarized alveolar lateral approximant * soft d * is a velarized alveolar retracted approximant tldr : soft d sounds like an english l ( or one of them ) but not a danish l. it 's the ls that have different sounds in each language . 
   danish children take the longest to learn their language as a brit currently learning danish , i can tell you that this is n't just true of danish children , but everyone learning the language . 
  it is very hard , so many vowel sounds ( even more than their 9 vowel letters ) , so few consonants and a * d * that sounds like an * l * . 
  on the flip side , it has been entertaining helping the danes i know pronounce all these extra consonants we have in english . 
  it does n't help that so few people learn danish that there is n't a decent english/danish dictionary available . 
  they are all designed for danes learning english , not the other way around . 
  the lat has been pegged to the euro for the last 8.5 years , and so is essentially the same currenty already , just with a get-out clause of being able to remove the peg should it become absolutely necessary . 
  what 's the incremental benefit of completely accepting the euro that makes getting rid of that get-out clause worth it ? 
  they have a bishop and the president of france as co-princes . 
  as such they are the only country in the world to have a monarch who is elected by common citizens . 
  however , as the president of france is elected by the french , they are the only country in the world to have their head of state elected by the citizens of a different country . 
  the ` breaking ' news is n't that it is anglicism of the year , but that it has just been included in the dictionary .
