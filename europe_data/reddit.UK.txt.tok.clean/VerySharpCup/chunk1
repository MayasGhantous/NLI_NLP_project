i 've only played ckii , but i 've seen my younger brother playing the other three . 
  as said before , i do love the fact that my geography is now much better . 
  in fact , my irish geography is now better than my english , scottish and welsh . 
  ( although technically a few counties have been renamed in the last 1000 years ), 
  is n't hearts of iron iii also one of their big games ? 
  it is significantly harder than the other three . 
  yeah , i presumed they were too small , but none are mentioned in the list the original poster gave us either . 
  still , you 're probably right . 
  a bank is probably the biggest . 
  i 'm sorry if this is a stupid question , but does moldova really have not companies worth mentioning at all ? 
  i mean , i know moldova is n't a country in the best condition , but even belarus is on this list , and belarus is n't known for being in the best condition by any stretch of the word . 
  same goes to the micro-nations . 
  we have the same joke here with a scotsman slapping an englishman . 
  i think you just went to an odd spot . 
  within a few minutes walking distance from my house are plenty of proper butchers , fishmongers , bakeries and greengrocers . 
  i 'm confused as well . 
  there are a lot of things i think the uk is lacking in and can improve on , but culture is definitely not one of them . 
  well played luxembourg . 
  well played . 
  i feel unlucky to have been born into it , meaning i get to be one of the unlucky few that can only speak one language . 
  i went to germany to practise german a few months ago , only for every person i found to speak english to me . 
  it genuinely seems that it 's pointless to learn another european language to me since nearly everyone can speak english already . 
  so if i am not to learn a european language , then i am limited to learning languages outside of the continent , which automatically makes it significantly harder since languages like korean or japanese are not as similar to english as french or german are . 
  it 's disheartening and , at least in a language sense , i genuinely feel unlucky for being born in the uk . 
  i ended up looking through the images . 
  after reading the comments i expected it to be r/spacedicks ( nsfl ) level gore , but it they 're not on that level . 
  regardless though , these images are completely disgusting ... 
  i am reading the backstory behind them . 
  thanks for the response . 
  it sounds like i would n't have gained anything by clicking the images so it 's probably for the best . 
  thank you for the response . 
  that sounds horrible , yet also like something worth reading about so i think i will look the names up . 
  thanks again . 
  can someone describe what 's in these images for those that are too wimpy to click ? 
  knew what this would be before i clicked it . 
  great weather ? 
  this comment makes me feel sad . 
  stereotypically , the swedish are n't blessed in the social skills department . 
  we 're not last in a language topic for once !, 
  well , if that 's what they 're taught i have no problem with it . 
  i just personally like splitting them up since it fits nicely with defining continents as the huge and distinct blocks of lands on earth . 
  not a sciency definition , but you get what i mean . 
  when you 've done something wrong , you might as well go all out and do everything wrong !, 
  i like how the eurasian continent is split into two even when , if you think about it , it 's really just one continent , while the americas , which are obviously two continents , have been grouped as one . 
  if the weather is hot then you drink a different drink !, 
  not defile one !, 
  d : to be honest , here people will drink tea no matter how hot it is . 
  people do n't really drink it to quench first . 
  more just as ` something to do while doing something else ' . 
  b-b-but it 's got ice in it !!, 
  ice !, 
  do n't waste more tea !, 
  if you feel the need to not let us have it , at least drink it yourselves !, 
  do n't waste it by throwing it into a harbour !, 
  also , it feels so weird seeing your username outside of ... a certain subreddit . 
  [ this is n't the only stupid thing they believe . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ysy8d/unvaccinated_children_will_be_barred_from/cygfh5l ), 
  that too . 
  i 'm willing to bet most people here would say ` yes ' to ` do you think your culture is superior to at least one other culture on earth ? 
  ' , but would probably say ` no ' to ` do you think your culture is superior to every other country on earth ? ', 
  too ambiguous . 
  to a lesser extent , asking if military force is sometimes necessary . 
  what does ` sometimes ' mean ? 
  if you disagree are you saying that you think that it 's always necessary or are you saying that it 's never necessary ? 
  i do n't like this statement :  our people are not perfect , but our culture is superior to others ( agree or disagree ) if you disagree with it , you could mean one of three things : 1 ) our people are not perfect , and our culture is inferior to others . 
  2 ) our people are perfect , and our culture is superior to others . 
  3 ) our people are perfect , but our culture is inferior to others . 
  ( weird case ), 
  i feel like i 'm reading about another country . 
  in my 5 years of university so far i 've not once met anyone that said anything anti-semitic , racist or sexist . 
  that video is insane . 
  i 've not really heard of anything like that happening here before . 
  ( although it probably does and i 've just not heard of it ) does that same district just do that same thing every year ? 
  i 've never heard anyone call it ` pre-school ' here . 
  i only hear it be called ` nursery ' . 
   ** favourite neighbour ** : britain   ** least favourite neighbour ** : england : /, 
  normally when someone says something about your country is terrible and makes fun of it , there 's this instinctive reaction to defend it and say ` it 's not that bad ' or ' x country does it worse ' . 
  this is not one of those times . 
  our tabloid newspapers and magazines are atrocious and they deserve to be made fun of by any and everyone . 
  #  i love you romania !, 
  i feel a similar way . 
  i wish i could agree . 
  donald trump being america 's president will only last 4-8 years , while we 're out of the eu forever at worst and for decades at best ( that is if anyone would ever want to let us back in , which i doubt ) . 
  unless donald does something really stupid with even longer lasting implications , which might happen . 
  we 're like that annoying kid throwing a tantrum in the middle of class while everyone else wants to get on with their work . 
  they 've told us to either be quiet and do our work or leave the room , but we still insist on rolling on the floor screaming . 
  [ this clip is feeling more real than ever before :( ] ( https://youtu.be/wdqayc1sr7g?t=81 ), 
  yeah , i only ever use the word ` nordic ' too since it 's much more inclusive and less confusing . 
  scandinavia is a much cooler sounding word though . 
  some people in england do a similar thing where they say ` england ' for things where they should say ` u.k. ', 
  i loved the guy at 2:37 pointing out that drunkards in each country must be from the one east of it . 
  i 'd not heard of norwegians thinking that of swedes before . 
  is that one true ? 
  also the height woman at 1:55 was quite sweet to listen to . 
  also , i have always thought that finland is not part of scandinavia , is it different in ukraine ? 
  or is it a case of ` you can include it but it 's not technically correct ' ? 
  maybe it 's just the people i hang out with then . 
  most people i speak to truly can not stand him . 
  still , i 've never spoken to anyone that does like him though . 
  every time he 's brought up with anyone i am with , they always say they hate the fact that he uses a ` loveable oaf ' persona to attract people .
