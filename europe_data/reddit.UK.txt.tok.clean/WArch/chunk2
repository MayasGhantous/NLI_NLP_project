  paul krugman called rent controls the second quickest way to destroy a city after nuclear weapons . 
  for example , contrary to what many people who do n't live there like to think venezuela 's experience with price controls has been terrible and led to huge shortages because companies simply wo n't sell goods if they 're going to make a loss ( or make a greater gain elsewhere ) . 
   this system is much more efficient than a private-run company , since capital is distributed inefficiently in a capitalist system . 
  but again , this is simply wrong . 
  you seem to be in a time-warp where none of the economic peer-reviewed literature since about 1950 seems to count . 
  centrally-planned economies invariably perform less well than their capitalist counter-parts . 
  now you might have noticed that i 've referred to the err-reviewed literature quite a lot , but not brought up any sources , and there 's a reason for that : i ca n't be bothered . 
  this is a comment on a website and i recognise someone who is n't going to have his mind changed even if the evidence is put right in front of them . 
  suffice to say that i know that i 'm right because i 've read the various peer-reviewed studies whilst i was at university and i ca n't be bothered to waste time fishing them out again because in the past i 've always been downvoted for bringing out peer-reviewed studies . 
  at which point i 'll bring up my last point to do with things you said at one point or other in this comment chain :  the fact that you 're incapable of telling me why they 're terrible ideas suggests you 're wrong . 
   also , let me give you a bit of a tip , mate : i 'm not the one obligated to find arguments for your opinions , you are . 
   the fact that you ca n't refute my argumentation and instead attempt to deride it through ridicule is pathetic . 
   you 're a waste of my time . 
   i 'm sorry but you 're not grasping the fundamentals of this . 
   i just countered this argument and you simply ignore it . 
  you 'd make a terrific politician . 
  you know , when you propose things you 're meant to back them up , not simply make statements and expect someone to disprove them for you . 
  an argument should stand on its own weight , not on the stamina of other people finding things that disprove you . 
  [ deutsche bank : scottish independence would bring austerity on a scale never seen before ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/09/deutsche-banks-devastating-analysis-scottish-independence-would-bring-austerity-on-a-scale-never-seen-before/ ), 
  it varies . 
  we 're bros with some ( e.g australia and new zealand ) and some others hate us ( e.g zimbabwe ) . 
  just to throw in my $ 0.02 , i would personally prefer it if the future cabinet were drawn from mep 's sitting in the european parliament . 
  the parties in the european parliament would form a coalition and choose a cabinet . 
  pros : no secrecy and more democratic legitimacy cons : there would be no guarantee that every country would get a minister, 
  to me one of the thigns that this shows is just how heavily populated the south east of england and the lowlands are, 
  i did n't notice at first that this was n't simply made by a person but by sky news . 
  77th - france, 
  this is correct . 
  most noticeably , in wales the employment rate and the unemployment rate are both higher than before the recession . 
   `` and if ukraine says we are going to the eurasian union now , the european union would never make a big conflict out of it , but would insist on a voluntary decision , '' merkel added just a tiny bit of an over-exaggeration . 
  wales , you 're letting the team down . 
  the family and friends of these people - that goes even more so for the handful who have gone off to fight for isis .

  that has been compensated with an expansionary monetary policy . 
  if the eurozone did an expansionary monetary policy then it would have a highly asymmetric impact : it would be welcome in the south but not the north . 
  it may yet be the least worse scenario though .

  the guardian ( and the telegraph as well for that matter ) have become a bit more prone to clickbait in recent years . 
  still , the guardian does a lot of stories that are undoubtedly unprofitable to investigate and even though i lean to the right i think that we would be worse off as a country if its finances forced it to close , so i do n't begrudge them clickbait stories . 
  ` dropping deep ' in this context meaning still above 60 % . 
  a lot of national leaders would kill for that sort of approval rating . 
  i found this interesting as it may have implications for why some countries are more eurosceptic than others , though some bits were confusing as the table on page 1 and the table on page 6 seemed to contradict each other at first glance but actually do n't . 
  australia, 
  according to [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/23cj93/percentage_of_the_average_annual_wage_you_will/ ) the income tax paid by a greek being paid the average greek wage is 0-5 % , so i can not see how the 7625 $ income tax can be accurate . 
  is that a palestine flag as well ? 
  this is what happens when the proportion of energy coming from renewables is targeted instead of co2 emissions . 
  coal is burned to bring down the overall price to balance out expensive renewables . 
  lord have mercy ... 
  georgia is ahead of * norway * on the prosperity and equality index :p, 
  long story short : all it takes is time . 
  the most affluent states of ` new europe ' , such as the czech republic , are about as wealthy as the poorest states of ` old europe ' , such as greece and portugal . 
  growth rates in eastern europe are also higher than in the rest of europe . 
  all it takes is time and keeping the conditions right for growth , i.e , not killing your economy with taxes and protectionist or cronyist regulations . 
  there should be a second [ betteridge 's law of headlines ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge's_law_of_headlines ) that says if a headline includes the words `` the real reason ... '' then it 's a conspiracy theory . 
  this is literally [ an episode of the simpsons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king-size_homer ), 
  i daresay that it 's similar to what a lot of english people are feeling towards the scottish right now . 
  make up your minds already !, 
  i sympathise with them . 
  poverty is clearly a factor ( look at the differences between east and west germany ) but hardly a strong one . 
  greece is on par with sweden and spain and portugal fare better than britain and germany . 
  what i 'd take from this is that healthcare can only go so far , diet and personal responsibility is key . 
  the mediterranean diet , with lots of unsaturated fat , looks like it is the way to go . 
  * plurality but yes , very interesting , especially compared to the fact that a lot of europe has shifted to the right , and in some cases the far-right . 
  admittedly it says ` overweight and obese ' , not just obese . 
  something like 70 % of americans are overweight already . 
  a lot of stuff in the british media is set in the napoleonic times ( [ sharpe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sharpe_\\ ( novel_series \\ ) ) and [ hornblower ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horatio_hornblower ) for instance ) but i would n't say that it portrays napoleon as the living embodiment of all that is evil . 
  in fact , they do n't really portray napoleon much at all . 
  it 's used as the setting for stories rather than the actual events of the napoleonic wars . 
  switzerland has as many of the top 50 universities as france or germany !, 
  per capita that must be insane . 
  i suppose it must be related to the fact that cern and some other things are based there . 
  and yet the top link in / r/europe at the moment is about the british public being wrong about everything !, 
  i 'd be intrigued if you could compare the various stages of education to other countries rather than just the overall score . 
  in the uk our universities are second only to america 's but as far as education below that it 's extraordinarily dysfunctional . 
  not much surprising in this list . 
  i was slightly surprised by greece though . 
  according to this list the tax freedom day in greece is later than germany but [ germany raises 41.1 % of gdp in taxes whereas greece raises just 36 % of its gdp ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_offpub/ks-sf-11-026/en/ks-sf-11-026-en.pdf ) .

  to some extent . 
  the french unemployment rate [ recently hit an all time high ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25922231 ) , but it is n't too dissimilar to the eurozone as a whole . 
  however , what is far more damning is the fact that the french unemployment rate has n't been below 7 % [ since 1980 ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/france/unemployment_rate.html ) . 
  i agree . 
  the obvious alternative would be for the broadcast to be on a 30 second delay so that there would be time for translators to dub the debate in whatever other languages . 
  he forgot to add the sequel http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_hundred_years'_war, 
  the people from mercia and wessex who identify as such could probably fit inside a telephone box .
