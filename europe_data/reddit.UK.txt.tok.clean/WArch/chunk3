  sorry , you 're right . 
  according to my calculations someone earning $ 25,000 ( # 20,500 ) would pay # 3,867 ( 18 % ) in tax in the uk and [ $ 11,830 ( 47 % ) in belgium ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kard4.gif ) http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/personenbelasting#tarieven http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxation_in_the_united_kingdom#income_tax, 
  i did some rough calculations and the tax rate in the uk on the average wage would be just under 20 % including national insurance and just over 8 % excluding national insurance . 
  greece was n't the only country to run a large deficit before the crisis , but it did run a larger one . 
  in 2004 [ greece ran a deficit of almost 8 % of gdp ] ( http://tutor2u.net/economics/revision-notes/a2macro-eu-greece3.png ) !, 
  52 % of the revenue for russia 's budget comes from energy exports , predominantly to the eu : http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=rs they are n't going anywhere . 
  i think that you 're being pedantic as it is obvious what he was getting at . 
  this chart includes biomass ( which is renewable but releases lots of co2 emissions ) but excludes nuclear ( which is not renewable but is low co2 ) . 
  according to this the uk has a relatively lower level of non-wage costs compared to countries such as france and germany http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=file:labour_costs_per_hour_in_eur,_2008-2013_whole_economy_excluding_agriculture_and_public_administration.png&amp;filetimestamp=20140326081119, 
  trailing in terms of output ( citations , patents , etc ) or inputs ( funding per capita ) ? 
  it 's a collection of national parties so it is slightly more difficult to classify than a single party . 
  but it will most likely be primarily anti-austerity . 
   european integration has always been heavily associated with the socialist end of the political spectrum in the uk well that 's not even slightly true . 
  labour was split in the seventies because the hard left wanted to withdraw whereas the moderate wing of the labour party and the conservatives supported greater integration . 
  are you sure it 's nominal ? 
  iirc the british minimum wage has increased nominally every year since the recession though not always above inflation ( though the variations could also be due to fluctuations in the pound-euro exchange rate ) . 
  edit : it says not adjusted for inflation . 
  it must be exchange rate fluctuations . 
  must n't grumble i suppose, 
  they do n't check you 've made a valid vote . 
  you could just scribble a penis on the poll card while you 're in the voting booth . 
  my grandfather was born during the first world war ( 1917 ) and fought in the second world war in north africa . 
  he 's still alive but may not be too much longer ; _ ; he has told me lots of war stories about the initial great retreat , the push back later and how he was briefly in italy for a bit and met the pope ( my grandfather was brought up catholic ) . 
  he was a staff sergeant and was in charge of his infantry platoon usually as their officers kept on dying . 
   risks of violent conflict rise when a surging youth population can not find productive employment the other day the bbc had a lecture by hans rosling about demographics . 
  one thing he mentioned is that when western nations developed we got a lot wealthier and then experienced a big drop in child mortality . 
  however , developing countries nowadays are experiencing a big drop in child mortality and then getting wealthier . 
  is this just pol sci waffle or do you think that this is connected to what this expert is saying ? 
  that the cause of this surplus of young men without employment is due to much lower levels of child mortality ( and thus more children surviving into adulthood ) but fertility is still high as the economy is not as developed as it was in the west when we had those levels of child mortality ? 
  when your only tool is a hammer , everything looks like a nail . 
  when you 're a marxist , like varoufakis , everything can be explained with `` class war '' . 
  do you think that the irony is lost on them ? 
  ... do they argue that though ? 
   do you think europe should n't take in any refugees in the first place ? 
  yes , because this actually does n't lead to more refugees getting help . 
  the cost of housing , feeding and sheltering a refugee in the eu itself is so much more expensive than helping them in somewhere like turkey , jordan or lebanon . 
  we should be giving these countries foreign aid to increase the number and quality of refugee camps whilst rejecting all those who make illegal crossings . 
  what was it ? 
  lightning does n't strike twice !, 
  to be fair , botswana is 31st and there are more than 30 european countries . 
  it 's just as much of a positive story about botswana than a negative one about europe . 
  [ '' * the french language for centuries on earth represented civilisation * '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klhzx7ukknu ), 
  i think you have to categorise them in two different groups : one where there is a need for a strong * demos * and feeling of unity between different countries , and one where there is not . 
  on the economy , the single market is an example of where a strong demos is not necessary . 
  it 's basically an extension of free trade and comparative advantage . 
  the eurozone is an example of where a strong demos is necessary , and indeed the eurocrisis is proof that one does not exist between eurozone countries . 
  as far as foreign policy and defence , there are some things that do n't require a strong demos : a mutual defence clause , removing duplication of every country having an r&d program into new tech , etc. 
  indeed , many of those sort of things already exist in the lisbon treaty . 
  then there are the sort of integrations that would require a strong demos , such as a single policy n sending troops abroad . 
  there is n't anything close to that sort of consensus in the eu . 
  imagine trying to make a single policy for something like the iraq war !, 
  the italian chefs antonio carluccio and gennaro contaldo have done a few bbc programmes too . 
  uk * the labour party has elected a new leader . 
  it marks a very decisive shift to the left . 
  * the scottish national party is exected to reveal the timescale for a possible second referendum on independence in its manifesto for next year 's scottish parliament election . 
  * northern ireland is having a bit of a meltdown . 
  a former ira gunman called kevin mcguigan was killed , apparently by his former comrades . 
  the unionist parties have walked out of parliament claiming that it shows the ira is still active , something sinn feinn denies . 
  * there was a bit of faux outrage after the prime minister made a joke about yorkshire but no-one was genuinely offended . 
  * mp 's reject a bill that would have legalised euthanasia by a big margin . 
  * the queen became the longest-reigning monarch in british history . 
  if it 's just background stuff like r&d and equipment inter-operability then i do n't get what the deal is . 
  indeed , there is some degree of co-operation already . 
   also `` number of mines closed '' is misleading maybe , but the graphs in terms of production do n't seem to imply that the drop under thatcher was not part of a wider trend [ from here ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7952388.stm ) [ one ] ( http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45581000/gif/_45581765_uk_mining48_08_466.gif ) and [ two ] ( http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45581000/gif/_45581766_uk_mining_11year466.gif ), 
  i do n't disagree that iraq was one of the worst foreign policy mistakes for a century , but only three people have ever led the labour party to a majority at an election . 
  the other two died in 1967 and 1995 . 
  he might be worth a listen to . 
  well , according to [ this ] ( http://www.conservativehome.com/leftwatch/2013/04/wilson-closed-more-coal-mines-than-thatcher.html ) ( source [ here ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/historical-coal-data-coal-production-availability-and-consumption-1853-to-2011 ) ) * mines closed 1964-70 +1974 -79 ( 11 years ) = 272 * mines closed 1979-1990 ( 11 years ) = 154, 
  unlikely , seeing as the eu referendum is going to be absolutely traumatic for the labour party . 
  corbyn is n't in favour of withdrawal just ( yet ) but he voted against britain joining the ec in 1975 , did n't rule out supporting withdrawal during the leadership election and draws a lot of support from the eurosceptic hard left . 
  during the eu referendum he 's going to have to piss off one of those groups , either 1 ) the eurosceptic hard left that he has associated with for most of his political career or 2 ) the pro-european soft left that makes up the majority of the labour party . 
  in the 1975 referendum he voted against the uk being part of the ec . 
  with regards to the future , he has n't ruled supporting withdrawal in the future though said that his preference is to stay in if the eu `` changes '' . 
  i could n't see berlusconi immediately so at first i presumed that he was wearing a pretty hat . 
  well we 've given [ c. 40 % of the foreign aid spending ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/04/11/2bf712b700000578-0-image-a-38_1441361012192.jpg ) coming from the eu on syria but you do n't hear us complaining . 
  it 's a bit odd they did n't colour in israel , which is also 0, 
   lol  * le lol * fixed, 
   pan-eu shipping company if you mean a nationalised monopoly on a continental scale then that sounds awful !, 
  integrating services could lead to integrating the single market in transportation though . 
  i do n't know what degree it is integrated but a lot of countries have anti-competitive licensing agreements ( e.g [ greece ] ( http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2021202,00.html ) ) so that could lower transport costs and do what you 're suggesting . 
   dual-language spam posts perhaps it 's just me , but i actually quite like it when people do that . 
  also i have now res-tagged dclausel as `` frog stalin '', 
  what was his comment before ? 
  i was going to mention louis xiv as a monarch who has reigned longer but wow , he is n't even in the top 10 . 
  [ found it !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/writingprompts/comments/2t1b9p/wp_its_the_year_2057_queen_elizabeth_still_reigns/cnuto8u ), 
  yes , but those people who want the best business environment do that because they think that those policies will ultimately end up serving humanity . 
  that 's the bias . 
  pretty much , they get told by smugglers that if they reach europe they will get a free house , job and car but then end up in tents that are no better than where they came from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wt8zvuwhwa, 
   i 'm so angry i made a sign i take it posters with '' * down with this sort of thing * '' are no longer original then ? 
  is giving money to a country you might be fighting in a couple of months a good idea ? 
  you think that the nazis would have still invaded poland if they had n't got the russians to collaborate with them ? 
  the point of getting the ussr to invade with them was to discourage the uk and france from honouring their promise to defend poland . 
  if the soviets had n't invaded poland then what makes you think that there have even been a war ? 
  how is that comparable ? 
  the munich agreement was a failed attempt at appeasement by giving germany german-speaking areas of czechoslovakia , the molotov -- ribbentrop pact was an opportunistic land grab . 
  and not only that but after the war the ussr kept the polish territory they had annexed . 
  [ or it 's chicken variant ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/yu0n5/roast_chicken_w_yorkshire_pudding/ ), 
  me too , the bottom two posts at the moment are both brits blaming russia for irradiating our sheep after the chernobyl disaster and their bombers not understanding what `` personal space '' is ... 
  well my point was two-fold , firstly that the spanish and the portuguese were the countries that started up and drove the transatlantic slave trade not us ( the vast majority of slaves went to brazil or the caribbean , were the life expectancy was drastically lower , whereas relatively few went to modern day usa or canada ) and secondly that the portuguese abolished abolished slavery in mainland portugal in the mid-18th century , long before we abolished it in mainland britain , and whilst i have n't read up on the subject i was under the impression that they abolished it in their colonies before we did too .
