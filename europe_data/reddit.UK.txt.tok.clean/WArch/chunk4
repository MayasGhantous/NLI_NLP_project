  we also abolished slavery in brazil !, 
  we passed a law called [ the aberdeen act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aberdeen_act ) informing the brazilians that they had now abolished it and would be tried by british courts if they tried to continue the trade . 
  also one mild edit , we were neither the driving force that started the atlantic slave trade nor the first major power to abolish slavery in our empire . 
  both of those go to the portuguese . 
  nixon was actually pretty good and would be remembered very fondly if it were n't for watergate .

  the ca\u0219caval pane seems like something i 'm going to have to try out ... 
  british food is essentially simplistic : some meat , some veg , some carbs . 
  pork scratchings go one step further in simplicity by being just a load of protein and fat bound together by salt . 
  though i have n't tried it , i 've seen some eastern europeans on here talk about salo which seems similar as it 's salted fat but raw . 
  i imagine both are good for when you 're drunk !, 
  you can make some yourself if you buy a cheap cut of pork belly that has lots of fat left underneath then cut the fat off . 
  the trick is to a ) make sure it is n't wet when you 're rubbing the salt in as if it 's wet it wo n't crackle and b ) make sure that that the side of the fat you 're rubbing the salt has small , shallow diamond cuts in it made with some scissors or a knife ( see what gordon ramsey is does in the first thirty or so seconds of this video to [ this pork belly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9biioteyehc ) , albeit he 's just roasting a pork belly , not making pork scratchings ) . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/23/homemade-pork-scratchings-picnic-family edit : there 's also cracking which is roasted or fried twice , but i find that that seems to take away a lot of the taste . 
  [ pork scratchings ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ksshfaf.jpg ) are great in a pub whilst drunk . 
  they 're basically deep-fried , salted pork fat . 
  there 's a reason we 're the fattest country in europe .

  he will never be prime minister , but he 's good in his current role and would make a good cabinet minister .

  on paper we 're an anglican theocracy * . 
  in practice i think that few countries have less religious influence on politics . 
  * the monarch is automatically the head of the church of england and all cof e bishops get a seat and voting rights in the house of lords ( upper house of parliament ) . 
  the yanks do n't really see much of a role by britain , so i do n't think that it 's quite right to say that we see it as the same as them . 
  both underestimate the ussr though . 
  the service is excellent . 
  subsidy cuts since 2006 have caused price rises though , which is where the disgruntlement comes from .

  [ an advisor to the bank of greece estimated that two in every three greek workers evaded tax ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21623742-getting-greeks-pay-more-tax-not-just-hard-risky-treasures ) , for example by understating their income on tax forms . 
  tax evasion in greece is simply not limited to a couple of wealthy businesses and pretending that the populace at large is n't to blame ( with exception to the young greeks ) is simply brushing the problems under the carpet rather than solving them . 
  how many hours is full time in each country ? 
  in the uk the government are going to pass a law so the zero rate personal allowance before you pay income tax is raised so that you pay no income tax if you work minimum wage full time , but they 're only counting `` full time '' as 30 hours . 
  check out luxembourg, 
  could it be due to a closing gender divide in employment ? 
  what was it ? 
  to oversimplify it drastically , in 1974 the greek junta sponsored a coup in cyprus with the aim of it becoming part of greece so turkish soldiers went on holiday in northern cyprus and since then the island has been split between the turkish cypriots in the north and greek cypriots in the south . 
  no-one recognises northern cyprus as an independent coutnry other than turkey . 
  plus the un considers it part of the republic of cyprus being under occupation . 
  the republic of cyprus ( the southern bit ) is an eu member state . 
  cyprus used to be part of the british empire and britain still has some overseas territories located on the island of cyprus itself . 
  ten years ago a plan was created that would re-unite the island and one of the many clauses would be that half the british-occupied land would become part of cyprus but it was rejected . 
  1 - the eu 's benefits are mostly intangible ( greater competition and trade creation ) whereas the costs are visible ( payments to the eu ) 2 - the greek crisis has made the eu seem impotent and unable to manage a crisis 3 - right wingers often resent the increased immigration and ( in the uk at least but maybe not elsewhere ) the increased level of regulation 4 - left wingers are starting to see the eu as ` pro-austerity ', 
  yes . 
  spending on interest payments have plummeted in greece from 7.2 % in 2011 to 3.8 % in 2014 .

  people have a tendency to call anything they disagree with as fascist . 
  it 's not new , george orwell [ wrote a brief essay ] ( http://orwell.ru/library/articles/as_i_please/english/efasc ) about it in 1944  it will be seen that , as used , the word ` fascism ' is almost entirely meaningless . 
  in conversation , of course , it is used even more wildly than in print . 
  i have heard it applied to farmers , shopkeepers , social credit , corporal punishment , fox-hunting , bull-fighting , the 1922 committee , the 1941 committee , kipling , gandhi , chiang kai-shek , homosexuality , priestley 's broadcasts , youth hostels , astrology , women , dogs and i do not know what else . 
  however , with golden dawn it 's an [ entirely ] ( https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/washingtonpost/2014/02/03/foreign/images/greece_golden_dawn-0ef66-8385.jpg?uuid=7lyzlizceeoyq_5skcf70q ) [ fair ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b7/chrisi_avgi_logo.svg/660px-chrisi_avgi_logo.svg.png ) description http://www.euronews.com/2014/06/25/photos-show-golden-dawn-leaders-nazi-salutes/, 
  snowflake europe i 'd have said that we 're definitely western though, 
  i meant that the reputation of the eu specifically amongst the british left wing has been damaged by the perception that the eu is ` forcing ' austerity on greece . 
  sorry if that was unclear . 
  though actually what you raise is important . 
  the perception of being ` pro-austerity ' does nothing to make the eu more popular amongst british ring wingers , but it does make it less popular amongst left wingers . 
  my vote is n't affected as i was always going to vote to stay in , but in short : yes , its hugely devastating to trying to convince people to stay in . 
  a lot of british support for the eu since the 1990s has come from the left wing but the perception of the eu as pro-austerity has damaged its standing amongst them 2 . 
  the british government often gets told that they 're damaging the perception of britain in the eu by seeking perfectly reasonable reforms , but the eu rarely seems to worry about its perception in britain . 
  the fact that the eu has been unable to solve a crisis afflicting just 2 % of the eu 's gdp makes the argument that a brexit would be damaging seem a bit hollow . 
  the more that the eurozone recovers , the more this argument seems faulty though and it will seem like britain has more to lose from leaving the eu , so it 's a matter of whether the eurocrisis gets sorted in the next few years . 
  at the end of the day , very few people in britain see the ` european project ' as anything desirable , the vote will be one of pragmatism .
