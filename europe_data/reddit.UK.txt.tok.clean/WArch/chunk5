  ah right , i get you . 
  what i meant was * the fate * of creating a single currency . 
  she [ wrote two books ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/margaret-thatcher-on-the-euro-2013-4?ir=t ) , one in 1993 and one in [ 1995 ] ( http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5162d9986bb3f7342f000018-606-533/downingstreetyearemu.jpeg ) . 
  she supported the ec and for a while monetary co-operation but [ opposed a single currency even while in office ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzzf7clhpg8 ) , though she left office before the maastricht treaty was passed . 
  he 's been sitting on that tweet for weeks, 
   up to 80,000 hereros lived in namibia when the uprising began . 
  afterward , only 15,000 were left . 
   `` within the german boundaries , every herero , whether found armed or unarmed , with or without cattle will be shot . 
  i shall not accept more women and children . 
  ... i shall order shots to be fired at them . '' jesus . 
  why did they stop at the last 15,000 ? 
  bargain balkan beer bought by boorish but bounteous british boys ? 
  maybe an incomplete list ? 
  i suppose it 's possible that in great britain not one person was killed , but certainly not in northern ireland - half of them on the list are from northern ireland as it is . 
  my understanding is sketchy , but the army had a heavy presence and took over some police duties during that period you mention , so any deaths then ( such as bloody sunday ) would n't count as deaths at the hands of the police . 
  structural funds have to be matched in half by the national government do they not ? 
  highly unlikely unless it 's for projects already planned . 
  the label for the west country in england is so unclear  west country english  country west english  english west country, 
  [ speaking of which ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cpk07/ok_heres_an_even_more_accurate_map_of_all_the/ ),

  http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database some of these are crazy  kocher jr was hit by a vehicle while he was walking , and the driver stopped and called police . 
  kocher jr was alive and responsive , according to eyewitnesses , but the attending officer struck kocher jr a second time with his vehicle as he arrived at the accident . 
  he was pronounced dead at the scene . 
  what were the changes ? 
  presumably , like the russians at the moment , he 's referring to the 1169-1922 ` holiday ' english troops took in ireland .

  the benefits greece has received due to the bailout ought to be obvious . 
  yeah , they are different contexts , but i hope that you continue with this sort of template . 
  a tl ; dr , an faq , a selection of links of live coverage , etc. 
  if it 's live then you can update it as the situation develops . 
  keep up the good work !, 
  so is / u/moderatorsofeurope the new way of organising megathreads ? 
  this megathread is much more detailed and organised than the previous ones that led to some annoyance . 
  well done mods . 
  fyi , use this as a template | country | gdp/capita | average salary | ( avg.salary / ( gdp/capita ) ) | | : ----------- | ------------ :| : ------------ :| : ------------ :| | eu average | $ 37,607 | $ 24,978 | 66 % | poland | $ 26,210 | $ 16,445 | 63 % | czech republic | $ 30,896 | $ 17,342 | 44 % | slovakia | $ 29,209 | $ 15,227 | 56 % | hungary | $ 25,895 | $ 15,019 | 58 % | greece | $ 26,773 | $ 23,756 | 89 %, 
  italy is almost as rich as japan ?? 
  which side is tsipras taking in the referendum ? 
  this album is the hottest post on wtf at the moment, 
  it 's more complicated than this , but essentially both the irish and madras famines happened because the british administrators did n't react to crop failures . 
  they should have initiating export bans but instead kept up exports ( both ireland and madras were supposed to be food exporters ) . 
  personally , i like it when people have a translation of their own language . 
  but i understand that it can be jarring for someone who speaks english as a second language , particularly if the non-english part comes first . 
  or if it is n't in italics . 
  france is not having a good day today . 
  really ? 
  why ? 
  is it not a case for a referendum based on the principle of national determination ? 
   countries have a right to prevent areas from seceding , do n't they ? 
  actually they do n't . 
  perhaps i 'm going mad , but i do n't think that [ her speech ] ( http://www.royal.gov.uk/latestnewsanddiary/speechesandarticles/2015/statebanquetspeechberlin24june2015.aspx ) was just confined to talking about the eu  in the nineteenth century in the russian empire a welsh engineer called john hughes founded a mining town which is now donetsk in ukraine . 
  ...  we know that division in europe is dangerous and that we must guard against it in the west as well as in the east of our continent . 
  ah yes , i was think more of countries like france when i typed that . 
  maybe it 's the median average instead of mean average and that 's why the usa is lower than expected ? 
  it would help if op could provide the methodology . 
  i 'm not sure that it 's accurate . 
  i think that ` net ' means ` after tax ' in this context which could explain it . 
  it does n't say if it 's nominal or ppp . 
  i 'd expect switzerland to topcit either way . 
  base and bass are pronounced the same way but bass is pronounced differently to both , albeit bass and bass are spelt the same way . 
  `` continue '', 
  i 'm not sure if the yorkshire accent is impenetrable , [ but monty python did a sketch about that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe1a1whxtyo ) .

  from 1525-1945 the main objective of england 's foreign policy ( and later britain 's ) was to [ prevent european hegemony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balance_of_power_\\ ( international_relations \\ ) #england ) . 
  probably . 
  the one section of society that is n't to blame for the current crisis are the young people , but they 're suffering from youth unemployment of over 50 % . 
  it is still being negotiated by the sounds of it http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/international/facilitating-trade/free-trade/index_en.htm, 
  perhaps to a degree , but speculation about whether greece shall leave the eurozone would continue as the speculators do not rely solely on the media for information but also internal news sources of their own . 
  plus the fundamentals of greece 's economic woes would remain . 
  or born yet, 
  to some extent that has happened in the uk with indian words such as bungalow , khaki and shampoo . 
  you have to put two arms on the left, 
   '' * spy agencies have said that they 've moved people but have n't given identities about who they 've moved . 
  therefore what they 're saying is obviously false * '' reddit can be extraordinary sometimes . 
  pretty much anyone involved in security has been saying this since it has happened : that by releasing hundreds of unrelated files rather than a specific and limited leak about things like prism snowden has doomed some people to having their cover blown and being killed or tortured for information . 
  it 's vicious , but not necessarily a circle . 
  the deficit has fallen from ( iirc ) 15.6 % of gdp to 1.4 %, 
  he was preparing to make that 282 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11668358/sir-christopher-lee-dies-as-he-prepares-to-start-latest-film.html,

  was this the abu hamza who has one eye and a hook for a hand ? 
  a $ 100 bond with a 1 % yield and 10 year maturity would basically mean you buy a $ 100 bond from the government , then the government gives you 1 % of that every year until it matures in ten years time , upon which you would then receive the full amount you lent in the first place of $ 100 . 
  in calculus when a curve goes from being concave to convex , i.e he 's saying that bond yields will start increasing 3 . 
  there are plenty of ways of defining money , m1 , m4 , etc. 
  the lower the number , the more liquid the asset ( liquid = how easily it can be used in layman 's terms ) . 
  presumably he 's referring to the eurozone 's qe .

  britain 's policy towards ireland has not been what you might call constructive , and yet [ there are 4,000 irish citizens in the british armed forces ] ( http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/graham-clifford-ira-attitude-to-irish-serving-in-british-military-belongs-in-1913-28956346.html ) . 
  some back-of-the-envelope calculations by me suggests that that means in per capita terms someone born in ireland is three times more likely to join the british army than a british muslim . 
  in that context , the number of muslims in the british military is disappointingly low . 
  as / u/traubert pointed out , the uk is their home country . 
  i doubt that that would have done more than delay the soviet union steam-rolling its way across europe . 
  just imagine if the warsaw pact covered most of europe though and it 's easy to see why d-day mattered . 
  the main problem was n't the spending and borrowing ( though that was an issue ) but rather the [ closed industries ] ( http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2021202,00.html ) and [ rampant tax evasion ] ( http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/10/12/two-out-of-three-greeks-commits-tax-evasion/ ) that huge numbers of greeks partook in that made greece uncompetitive . 
  much as it 's popular to simply blame politicians for this mess , it is n't just politicians to blame . 
  though it 's sad that the section who bear no blame ( the young greeks ) are suffering the hardest in terms of unemployment for a situation they did n't create . 
  why are you so convinced that the reforms will be bad for eastern europe ? 
  if anything it 's the only thing likely to [ stem the brain drain from east to west ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/24/britain-east-europe-brain-drain-bulgaria ), 
  i reckon that it 's less about decreasing hate and ignorance and more about trying to create a demos , so that people will eventually become in favour of a full blown transfer union ( which is what the eurozone needed from the start ) .
