  i 'm pretty sure blatter was bribed to s stand down . 
  not even joking, 
  are there any polls showing the change in support/predicted coalitions ? 
  and is the pension age being so low a cause of uncompetitiveness and thus a cause of gdp being so low ? 
  it 's a mixture . 
  i ca n't remember the source but greece has always had very generous pensions . 
  in particular , italy 's gdp per capita is not at all low , it 's demographics . 
  if anything i would say that that 's more of a hurdle . 
  countries that would suffer from a loss of cap payments would almost certainly protest ukraine 's admission . 
  i agree with what you 're saying though . 
  if the point of cap is food security then it should n't matter which european country it comes from as long as it 's stable . 
  also , as far as opportunity goes people underestimate how big ukraine is , until the 1990s when all post-communist countries had demographic troubles ukraine 's population [ was almost as big as france or the uk ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_pop_totl&amp;idim=country:ukr:pol&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_pop_totl&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ukr:fra:gbr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=265417200000&amp;tend=1369954800000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  [ from the looks of things ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:ro:hu:bg&amp;ifdim=world&amp;ind=false#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:hu:pl:lt:ro&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) hungary was hit harder by the 2008 financial crisis and has n't recovered as well as its peers, 
  cameron has never been in favour of a brexit and will be campaigning in favour of britain staying in the eu no matter what the outcome of these negotiations are . 
  though to be honest , the red-lines for most british people will probably be the proposed welfare reforms for eu migrants . 
  several other eu member states have similar restrictions , albeit not for as long as cameron wants . 
  that is undoubtedly what he wants to organise so the reforms are n't going through a court to test their legality while the referendum is going on . 
  it helps if you have seen a picture of pre-ww2 borders . 
  the yellow/orange part was part of germany . 
  the blue part was western poland . 
  eastern poland extended further to the east than current polish borders and thus beyond ops picture . 
  there was also another part of germany separated from the rest of germany by the polish corridor . 
  that polish corridor was mostly polish but with a large german minority . 
  in 1939 molotov and ribbentrop split poland in half . 
  after the war the soviets refused to give up ` their ' half of poland . 
  as a result the boundaries were redrawn so that what was then eastern germany became part of poland and all of the germans were pushed out of that land and into present germany . 
  but the reason the partition still exists is basically infrastructure from back in those days . 
  [ in australia at least ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rabbits_in_australia#control_measures ), 
  what has been the change in productivity ? 
  if unemployment is pretty low then that is where the growth would likely come from ? 
  the real ira [ pops up every now and again ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_real_irish_republican_army_actions#2014 ) which is what i presume that it refers to . 
  did n't you read it ? 
  we do n't have enough wild bunnies . 
  the british public weight these things very differently . 
  whilst i think that 4 and 5 are the most important , the two things that the public probably weight as the most important are 1 , 2 and 3 . 
   23 ) greece  25 ) norway erm ... 
  < insert joke about investing in eastern poland  though it sure will be interesting to see how this affects relations with russia . 
  this is die linke 's euro-party affiliation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_the_european_left, 
  is it anti-americanism or could germany potentially lose a lot of trade if ttip is passed ? 
  i remember reading about that , the us air force realised that no matter how much they perfected their drills they could n't respond quickly enough to the prospect of a prospective nuclear strike . 
  though in fairness i would n't say that that 's comparable as far as aggressiveness goes to the russian drills in the op . 
  are there similar nato exercises ? 
  why is support so low ? 
  i agree , which is why i think that people are being a bit sensationalist . 
  30 hours does seem a bit much though . 
   hyperpower * cringe * does there really need to be something above superpower ? 
  and would it really apply to us more than the us in the 90s ? 
  ... if blue means the modern border then is northern ireland part of england in this ? 
  that one extra submarine we have is putting in a lot of bloody extra work !, 
  also it 's the position of the eu that member states should, 
  it is n't tory party policy to leave the eu , the policy is to have a referendum . 
  it will be up to the campaign in favour of leaving , which cameron will not be part of no matter what happens over the next two years , to do that . 
  i do n't think that the party system has disintegrated enough in the usa to warrant a pr system . 
  that is n't to say you do n't have tonnes of electoral reform that the country could benefit from : stopping gerrymandering , controlling campaign spending , abolishing the electoral college and switching to av for presidential elections , etc. 
  maybe abolishing elected judges but i do n't know too much about that . 
  [ here is a graph of the compared spending plans ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/82513000/gif/_82513589_party_spending_plans_624gr.gif ) . 
  red is labour , yellow is the ` anti-austerity ' snp . 
  the snp won through being fundamentally dishonest and ( as they do not have to enter in a labour coalition ) wo n't ever be called out on it . 
  they are n't voting on scottish matters because of devolution . 
  it 's something called the west lothian question, 
  anything devolved to the scottish parliament for the scots but in the westminster parliament for the english, 
  well ... the lib dems did do better than 10 !, 
  what i want to know is whether the snp will stick to their rule on not voting on english matters ? 
  gone and replaced by whom ? 
  how many of the labour big beasts are even left ?!, 
  i did a double take , i thought that you meant that you expected the snp to win fewer than 10 seats !, 
  i too think that the liberals will do a bit better and the conservatives , the snp and and maybe labour will do a bit worse . 
  it could simply come down to the turnout, 
  this is n't even the maddest ever result . 
  in 2005 labour won over 350 seats with 35 % of the vote , compared to the tories ( predicted ) to get 280-316 with 34 %, 
  yes , they gave people a bonus through their health savings accounts, 
  no jokes , i think that the fact that russia wants us to leave has been one of the reasons that the number of people who want to leave the eu has dwindled, 
  the went from cork to prague only to go to an irish pub ? 
  a single army would not be a good idea but there are legitimate arguments for two other things : * r&d - to spread the cost of research , pool talent and increase interoperability * peacekeeping under an eu banner - will enable eu troops to go places nato and their own countries ca n't . 
  how often are there polls on merkel 's approval rating ? 
  they 're two different things . 
  there has been a number of mps in westminster found to be paedophiles ( almost all of the revealed ones are now dead , so there may be others that are n't being revealed ) . 
  also , unconnected to that paedophile ring in some cities there have also been rape gangs , some of which have found to be either ignored by the local councils or not investigated by the police http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rochdale_sex_trafficking_gang http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oxford_sex_gang http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peterborough_sex_abuse_case http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/derby_sex_gang http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bristol_sex_gang http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telford_sex_gang, 
  that 's to be expected though . 
  i was more surprised by denmark . 
  ah right , that 's interesting . 
  the reason for labour dominating cities in the uk is that labour has traditionally been 90 % + funded by trade unions that have been disproportionately based in manufacturing and mining . 
  manufacturing and mining are based in the northern cities , welsh valleys and central urban belt of scotland , i.e those places they currently have seats . 
  since the decline of manufacturing and unions in those places though it has basically just been inertia keeping them voting for labour , which is why there is so much dissatisfaction amongst the british left wing . 
  every party supports devolution , when the proposals get put to a referendum people keep on rejecting them . 
  i 'm interested to hear or read more about norway 's conservative cities . 
  it is true also that in the uk london ( which has only had four elections ) elected a conservative the last two times in a row , though as far as seats goes is still mostly labour . 
  from the dutch and belgians, 
  i 'm pretty certain that an equal distance between london , berlin and paris is roughly brussels , or that 's his joke at least, 
  stop being so unambitious : [ lets drain the north sea with a dam from britain to denmark ] ( http://flashbak.com/1930-the-plan-to-drain-and-dam-the-north-sea-and-create-doggerland-8171/ ), 
  were n't the pensions cut and the retiring age raised since 2011 ? 
  it 's hard to sympathise with the people who opposed those reforms though looking at stats like those . 
  i thought the same about ross , skye and lochaber but it looks like kennedy 's getting the boot . 
  you guys might want to tell them how peachy that worked out . 
  here 's the rest of [ their defence policy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5eirwpv.png ) if you were interested . 
  their foreign policy segment was naive to the point of insane . 
  they say that they support a `` negotiated settlement '' between russia and ukraine or between the palestinians and the israelis . 
  really ? 
  was anyone going into the elections saying '' * fuck this , i want war between these guys * ! '', 
   demand for food banks demand or supply ?
