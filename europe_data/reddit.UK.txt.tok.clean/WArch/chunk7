  or put another way , has the need for foodbanks gone up or was it the case that a decade or so ago there were plenty of people who needed food banks , there just were n't any . 
  i do n't know which is the case . 
  the only stat i 've seen was from the oecd which says that [ the number of people without food has gone down ] ( http://www.oecd.org/unitedkingdom/oecd-societyataglance2014-highlights-unitedkingdom.pdf ) , but it 's not a regular poll . 
  i was talking about clegg 's seat , sheffield hallam . 
  not only has labour never been elected to sheffield hallam , they have n't even been second since 1979 . 
  they will probably come second or first this time but seeing as the top two parties there have been the tories and lib dem since 1979 then i think that it 's traditionally a tory v. lib dem seat . 
  clegg can speak quite a few other languages too , i thought that he should have been nominated as a european commissioner back in 2014 but it seems that he wants to lead his party through the next election . 
  i do hope that he keeps his seat , despite his seat being a tory/lib dem marginal from what i 've heard the tories are expecting enough of their voters to lend their support to clegg to keep him in . 
  well here 's a map showing a prediction from 538 . 
  light yellow are the snp http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/uk-general-election-predictions/ so yes , they are doing rather well, 
  extraordinary , i 've never heard about this . 
  i would have thought that they would just be taken by german soldiers when supplies were short . 
  was there any other sort of communication/exchange other than just these parcels ? 
  and i would have been glad to swap my tobacco for the pork !, 
  not to mention cockfosters, 
  i was wondering why on eleventh night the loyalists have been known to burn palestinian flags along with the irish and ivory coast ones . 
  no , but there is support in other eu countries for social security reforms that affects both eu and non-eu immigrants like those proposed by the tories . 
  i think that the circles represent negotiations currently being underway . 
  switzerland and norway are n't currently negotiating . 
  i thought that iceland had withdrawn too . 
  the manifestos also came out . 
  46 % supporting '' * seeking ways of reducing the size of the human population * '' seems like the bigger headline to me, 
  but it at the end of this http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache: e.g http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1f69429a-e515-11e4-a02d-00144feab7de.html, 
   but the principle of it - hell yes . 
  until the final copy comes out that is all we can support or oppose - outside of a few things that are certain to be in like isds . 
  the fears over isds sound sensationalised to the point of being dishonest . 
  correct stereotype : we suck at learning foreign languages . 
  there 's a lot less pressure to as most people speak english . 
   erekt, 
  i can remember some pretty big protests in moscow in 2011 . 
  is there no chance of that happening again ? 
  heresy !, 
  you clearly have n't seen the new star wars trailer . 
  your english is perfect . 
  what you 're saying about the economy on the other hand is not !, 
  was this guy high ? 
  i love how the general just plays it off though, 
  the potato famine in ireland too . 
  also the penal laws . 
  there 's a bunch of other things too . 
  best just to put : ireland . 
  i 'm not too sure why you credit britain with the enlightenment , though we have had our fair share of philosophers : hobbes , locke , etc. 
  russia will liberalise their oil and gas industry when hell freezes over so realistically this is just their way of asking for the sanctions to be dropped and the common external tariff to not apply to them . 
  you have lots of renewables but also a lot of coal to subsidise the price . 
  in the uk we have less renewables but less co2 emissions , in part because we do n't have so many coal power plants . 
  the german government wants a unified military ? 
  rugby and cricket would be second and third i think . 
  i drew [ this up ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hi9w0kt.png ) in case it helps anyone else to roughly visualise the nuance . 
  the hardest hit were the poor who are now back to the late 70s/early 80s . 
  the richest are also back to the 80s but middle class incomes were least hardest hit and are in the same level as the mid 90s . 
  britain more expensive than sweden ?!? 
  what 's going to happen in iceland to kill 25,000 people :o, 
  his comment karma score is -52 , i think he 's trolling, 
  most boring : all are interesting but unfortunately probably one of the baltics . 
  though i have liked all the chaps whom i have met from there the communists had quite a way of crushing the originality out of a country most interesting : france followed by greece , italy and spain in no particular order . 
  they all have such interesting cuisine , languages , architecture and histories . 
  because on the survey link 10 is unfavourable and 1 is favourable, 
  are there any countries that recognise any antarctic territorial claims ? 
  rip lough neagh, 
  i saw one yesterday in the natural history museum . 
  it 's really incredible to look at despite being tiny because of the history i 'm surprised how any go stolen though, 
  bit rude . 
  what do you hate about france ? 
  i thought that the french one looked like it had the nicest food ( fucking *** deer *** ?!? ) . 
  i could n't live without a few cups of tea a day though , so it has to be either britain 's or denmark . 
  similarly , keep calm and carry on . 
  we might be at war [ but service resumes as usual ] ( https://playingintheworldgame.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ypjwzep.jpg ) . 
  the wealthiest parts of ` new europe ' have certainly caught up with the poorest parts of ` old europe ' . 
  brits who make those jokes were actually the butt of the joke in those episodes of faulty towers as it so happens !, 
  this sounds similar to the uk . 
  iirc we abolished it in the uk in 1803 and in the rest of the empire in 1833 . 
   u wot m8 ? 
  ftfy, 
  i 'm surprised by how many countries did n't abolish it until the 90s/00s . 
  is it less simple than that ? 
  britain has almost always had a professional-only army since the 17th century so it 's not really a thing over here . 
  [ o-ok hans ; _  ( http://i.imgur.com/bgtzjln.jpg ) though i suppose my post just technically broke rule 2.2 ... 
  if he 's pretending that we need us permission then there is no sauce because he 's talking bollocks . 
  people who do n't think britain should renew trident like to pretend that we need the us 's permission to fire them whereas actually we do n't . 
  the think tank 's report [ was n't as simple ] ( http://2ihmoy1d3v7630ar9h2rsglp.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/20-03-2015-infographic-what-hurdles-does-the-uk-have-to-overcome-to-prosper-outside-the-eu-article_image_new.png ) as ` britain will lose 2.2 % of gdp ' , there were a number of different outcomes . 
  here 's a link if you 're interested http://openeurope.org.uk/blog/britain-can-prosper-post-brexit-if-it-embraces-free-trade-and-deregulation/, 
  poor new zealand too , [ always left out ] ( http://worldmapswithout.nz/ ) . 
  [ 506,913,394 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union ) . 
  honestly , i thought germans were supposed to be precise !, 
  game theory wise both sides are seeking absolute gains . 
  suddenly shutting off trade between the uk and eu would have negative effects on the eu as well and thus almost certainly be avoided . 
  the only thing that would concern the eu in this scenario is the free trade deal . 
  it 's the uk public that would probably not accept the other parts . 
  here 's the open europe piece that this article is based on . 
  http://openeurope.org.uk/blog/britain-can-prosper-post-brexit-if-it-embraces-free-trade-and-deregulation/ according to it the possible outcomes are : * brexit and no trade deal : -2.2 % of gdp * brexit and comprehensive trade deal with eu : -0.8 % of gdp * brexit , comprehensive trade deal with eu and some deregulation of current eu laws : -0.1 % of gdp * brexit , comprehensive trade deal with eu , unilateral acceptance of free trade and some deregulation of current eu laws : +0.6 % of gdp * brexit , comprehensive trade deal with eu , unilateral acceptance of free trade and deregulation of both some deregulation of the current eu laws and ` others ' ( it mentions climate change as an example ) : +1.55 % of gdp some thoughts : * both the first and last option are realistically never going to happen , even if the uk leaves the eu * when most eurosceptics talk about the eu they are n't thinking about regulations but immigration . 
  if the cost is 0.1-0 .8 % of gdp at worst then some might accept it , though the comprehensive trade deal might have freedom of movement as a condition . 
  not exactly what you asked for but i found this interesting http://geacron.com/home-en/?&amp;sid=geacron149037, 
  does ` open markets ' in this context mean free from taxes and regulation ? 
  or open as in no tariff barriers or non-tariff barriers ? 
  because tariffs are pretty much always bad . 
  not recently . 
  the only area where we are more free market than the average eu country are income taxes on low earners and our vat rate is low relative to the eu too ( 20 % with lots of items that are 0 % rated including food ) . 
  our planning laws are insanely strict and our healthcare system is probably the most left wing in the developed world . 
   abortion every poll i 've seen on abortion has the tories and labour dead-even on being both for and against . 
  it 's literally ( in literal sense ) a non-issue as people do n't divide on party or ideological lines .
