   99.88 of the romanian population are homo-nazi cia/ss shills fixed that for you, 
  something tells me that this union is simply called ` russia ' . 
  alternatively it might be because you live in ireland . 
  it was cloudy for me to though so i can hardly talk . 
  [ not necessarily . 
  ] ( http://www.iiea.com/files/admin/image/infographics/effective_eu_corporate_tax_rates.jpg ) the effective rate is very different to the headline rate in most countries anyway . 
  edit : i thought you were referring to just corporation tax , not income tax as well . 
  my mistake , i 'll leave the link there in case you find it interesting . 
  excise duties on cigarettes in the uk are extremely high . 
  i imagine that that 's the case in ireland as well . 
  are the things in the pictures from the government or are they from putin fans ? 
  it looks like an art exhibition . 
  it depends on the size of the operation . 
  france has acted unilaterally in mali as has the uk in sierra leone . 
  you would have thought that as soon as the death rumours start showing up that he 'd make a public appearance , even if it was just walking his pet tiger or something . 
  fetal position maybe . 
  god help your toes if you accidently kick when you wake up sometimes though . 
  i 've heard that it [ boosts grey matter ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3739690.stm ) and [ delays alzheimers ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/feb/18/bilingual-alzheimers-brain-power-multitasking ) . 
  i do n't know if that 's true though , it might just be correlation = / = causation . 
  or if there 's a difference between extremely different languages and learning to very similar languages are n't so good or something . 
  somewhat less so compared to previous years . 
  a lot of tories for whom the issue of europe was paramount have left for ukip . 
  since cameron decided to support a referendum in which he will fight to stay in the tories are probably the most united on europe they 've been for thirty or more years . 
  i wonder what if you looked at other non-party ways though . 
  for example , are labour supporters as keen on the eu as they were 20 years ago ? 
  certainly the tories are n't . 
  it 's similar to how support for the tories is highest amongst the elderly but british social attitudes survey found that the elderly were the most likely to name the welfare state as one of the uk 's greatest accomplishments . 
  even if ukip are doing poorly amongst the young it does n't necessarily mean that the young are n't more eurosceptic . 
  i agree that support for ukip is likely to drop once average incomes start rising though . 
  could those statistics simply be due to the recession ? 
  the countries with the greatest proportion of part-time workers seem to be those with more liberal labour laws and lower unemployment rates . 
  in the uk the town of `` dull '' is twinned with the town of `` boring '' ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dull-boring-twin-town-inhabitants-2372158 ), 
  timor-leste seems to be going a bit over the top if you ask me . 
  this might warrant a sarcastic response , but old postboxes in ireland have gr on them ( ' * george regina * ) . 
  i thought that over the past century they would have replaced them all . 
  the people who do stand still on the left on escalators have all been swiftly murdered in fairness . 
  it 's counter-intuitive but the uk is [ making more progress ] ( http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/03/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-rose-in-2012-decc/ ) on cutting co2 emissions than increasing our share of renewables . 
  to take germany as an example why , in germany almost two and a half times as much of their energy comes from renewables ( as the op link shows ) but [ they emit more co2 per capita than us ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=en_atm_co2e_pc&amp;idim=country:gbr:usa:fra&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=en_atm_co2e_pc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:gbr:usa:fra:deu&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) because [ 45 % of their energy comes from coal ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/world/europe/germany-carbon-emissions-environment.html ) to keep energy relatively cheap whereas we use extremely little coal . 
  in my opinion , making the proportion of energy coming from renewables as the legally binding target was short-sighted , it should have been overall co2 emissions per capita instead . 
  [ or just enforce them ] ( http://www.iiea.com/files/admin/image/infographics/effective_eu_corporate_tax_rates.jpg ), 
  well the uk and ireland are grey too , so til croatians are native english speakers . 
  seeing as they would affect the whole schengen zone , is this perhaps being used as a betting chip to try and secure a better deal as far as relaxing austerity goes ? 
  it 's quite interesting actually . 
  often a high rate of cancer is a good sign , it means that people are living longer and thus dying of cancer rather than various other things at a younger age . 
  greece has both a lower cancer rate and quite a long life expectancy . 
  must be that mediterranean diet . 
  well it ca n't be the british migrants there , it 's not like any of them speak spanish . 
   kinda strange when you think about it , neighbors for such a long time , and practically no conflicts was there by any chance a much larger neighbour that made itself a common enemy to the three ? 
  what 's a rough translation of what they 're saying in the op ? 
  it looked like they were just saying that someone looked like a nazi , was the note at the end what they 're pretending is ukrainian currency or was that just a shot of some nazi currency ? 
  the eu or europe ? 
  surely that figure ca n't include russia or ukraine . 
  so do n't support a monetary union that tries to mash together those that do with those that do n't . 
  cameron is n't going to resign . 
  the one definite outcome is that cameron will pop off to brussels to renegotiate . 
  though it is n't certain whether the renegotiation will be a ) a modified term of membership for the uk and a second referendum ( similar to what has happened to denmark and ireland over treaties ) or b ) a post-brezit membership . 
  what were the polls like for the lisbon referendum ? 
  over here the remain camp has blown a 20 % lead to a single digit one, 
  both the remain and leave campaign can only legally spend # 7 million in the entire referendum . 
  this is a # 9 million leaflet job literally entitled `` why you should vote to stay in the eu '' but * does n't * count as part of the remain campaigns expenditure . 
  it only has pro-eu arguments in it . 
  nothing to the contrary about the risks of remaining . 
  really ? 
  it 's more of an anti-establishment trend across the western world . 
  there are many reasons , mostly globalisation , but ultimately i think that they can be summed up as economic ones . 
  that 's also why the areas worst hit ( because of the euro ) have seen the most extreme anti-establishment party gains . 
  subsequent british governments have always been among the strongest supporters of policies that have actually worked ( e.g single european act , eastern expansion , etc ) and the fiercest ( and least listened to ) critic of policies that have proven disastrous ( most notably the euro ) . 
  but emissions are flat , because increasing renewables is n't the same as reducing ghg emissions . 
  the priority should be phasing out coal . 
  the buildings are fixed to the ground and do n't fly anywhere you silly billy , that is n't how an airport works . 
  it 's the benefits of increased exports too ,, 
  and how can the spying agencies know which ones to target with `` mass surveillance '' laws ? 
   so how are all these illegals coming to europe boats mostly, 
  you 're a redditor since today called acidental546 who is reporting on an accident ? 
   someone was defending isis comparing them to the ira [ well that reminds me of this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msfljrj7m4a ) thankfully i have n't seen anyone defend isis in person but i have no doubt it exists . 
  a while ago the national union of students in britain rejected a motion ( at one of their conferences i think ) to condemn isis as they thought it would be islamophobic ( they did n't seem to think that condemning israel would be antisemitic , which it of course is n't ) .

  this is an unbelievably stupid situation . 
  the norwegian government estimate that the cost of helping one refugee in norway [ could have helped 26 in refugee camps closer to syria ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3nbk5f/scandinavians_split_over_syrian_influx/ ) . 
  the ratio is undoubtedly much lower for countries that are n't norway , but this is still a situation in which hundreds of thousands of syrian refugees are having asylum withdrawn , not given to them , by naive europeans . 
  take with a small sack of salt . 
  i simply saw this on / r/ukpolitics so ask that poster where he got it https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3skmc2/apparently_here_is_what_each_country_will_be/ it seems more relevant here than there though . 
  having said that i 'm not sure if this is non-verifiable and will therefore be deleted . 
  the article conveniently misses the bit where oil companies pay an 81 % tax on their profits . 
  the subsidies are just incentives for fracking new fields . 
  given that they pay 81 % taxes on the profits they make from those new fields it 's hardly as simple as the article is portraying . 
  corbyn has to be sworn into the privy council . 
  to do that one has to kneel to the queen . 
  though there 's a long established precedent for republicans that , as they do n't wish to kneel to the queen , they will write ahead telling the palace that unfortunately they will accidentally sustain a small knee injury on the way to the ceremony and thus not be able to kneel so that no one loses face . 
  did you even read the letter ? 
  it even includes specific references to how the reforms benefit all of the member states . 
   their essentials did n't really seem essential to me , and everything cost more in britain supermarkets are just an extension of the class system . 
  funny , they 're part of efta but left the eea in 1993 ( though they were a member before that ) . 
  the bottomless pit of asterisks in treaties related to the eu continues ... 
  well * no two eea members are alike , but they are n't obliged to implement all eu regulations . 
  the norwegians tend to implement almost all of them , the swiss adopt relatively few . 
  this is the main reason to leave . 
  however , what 's important to consider here are the size of the countries involved .
