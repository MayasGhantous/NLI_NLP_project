tbh , most nations were built upon terrible war crimes . 
  i mean i can probably write a book worth of crimes that the english have committed against the scots , irish and welsh ( and vice versa ) yet we all live side by side . 
  georgia 's breathing , but this particular pic is bleh, 
  it was a joke lad , did n't mean to come off as pedantic or whatever . 
  i care very little about proper grammar on the internets . 
  let 's hope that it does . 
  you ca n't revert what happened , but you can still towards the better future . 
  it is really up to your leadership and people really . 
  if you think that murdering others is a european and civilized way , then go for it . 
  it 's a conspiracy !, 
  we must go deeper . . 
  where are the infamous sandal-socks wearers . 
  this picture seems fishy . . hmm, 
  no , it seems like you wish to dominate the very people that do not wish to be a part of your nation and would , like b&h once did , seek independence from it . 
  seems logical to me . 
  again , it would ease up the ethnic tensions as well as allow everyone to finally move towards the eu that you all gravely need . 
  [ it might be .

  seems awfully racist though do n't you think lad ? 
  this is my life now, 
  you want b&h whole , but at the same time you wish to fight the very people that make up large portion of your population . 
  seems quite schizophrenic if you ask me , but then again you balkanites are an odd bunch so what do i know . 
  most germans in the 40s were good actually , it 's just the vocal minority that did all the bad stuff . 
  look at kosovo . 
  it 's peaceful and prosperous now , is n't it ? 
  would n't you want the same for b&h as well ? 
   * races ) of dog umm , what ? 
  it 's called [ dog breed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dog_breed ), 
  apparently , just you, 
  it really has nothing to do with rewarding of anyone . 
  it was proven time and time again that the balkan region is heavily divided by ethnic lines and that talks of unity are only but a madman 's dream . 
  split bosnia between croats-bosnians-serbs and be done with it . 
  it might not be ideal , but in the end ethnic tensions will dribble down a bit and everyone can move on towards the eu and better future . 
  well i 'm favor of self-determination of people through democratic and politically fair process . 
  this talk of aggression and war is kind of hypocritical given that b&h itself was carved out of yugoslavia by the means of military aggression and separatism . 
  it 's only fair that people who do not wish to partake in it be given the right to self-determination . 
  at least that 's how it should be in europe , a beacon of democracy . 
  war doe seem fun , yeah definitely . 
  i figure that war itself was started due to poor economy and leadership and this exact policy is what will be the cause of another conflict unless both sides identify common ground and build relations . 
  that soros guy sure is a dick . 
  fuck that guy, 
  do n't know lad , it kind of seems counterproductive for everyone in the end . 
  seems to me like they do not wish to be under the bosnian rule , for whatever reason and are hence making it difficult for everyone to progress . 
  better let them be so that you can actually push for the eu integration and improvement of economy . 
  do you think that secession of republic of srpska would lead to betterment of b&h 's economy as well as its acceleration to eu ? 
  as far as i 've seen , it 's the rs that 's hold b&h back from developing itself beyond the third world status . 
  `` private '' . 
  yeah sure pepe . 
  member `` the evil fucks of europe '' shitpost way ?

  have n't heard of croatian ustashe i presume then ? 
  gib clay, 
  gee , austrians had some style . 
  love the a-h architecture . 
  ah i was just mocking about , could n't care less about / r/the _ donald and i never post there as it 's mostly `` political correct '' 4chan 's / pol / ( as ironic as that sounds lol ) . 
  sure , but i 'm rather disappointed as i had numerous questions regarding / r/the _ donald that will now forever fade into nothingness . 
  so i take it you 're not a phd then ? 
  umm , your username . . 
  precisely , i agree wholeheartedly with this . 
  we 're not about to leave one `` union '' ( essentially a vassalization ) , only to be absorbed by another .

  seems like you 're [ right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghost_in_the_shell_\\ ( 1995_film \\ ) #audio ) , fascinating stuff . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  that i 'm wrong ?!, 
  preposterous !, 
  [ it is n't ? 
  i beg to differ , you fool .

  aye , i find it hilarious that most eu countries are poorer than greece , yet a lot of them are ignorant of their own economics and bash on greece just because . 
  kind of ironic , is n't it . 
  i ca n't wait for the where imperialism and ownership of people is looked down upon . 
  that 's serbian flag you fool, 
  so this is a nice development . 
  ura russkies !, 
  try yanks ' fahrenheits and you 'll learn all to quickly that 's peanuts . 
  eu brought us more good than it did harm .

  it 's predominantly frankish symbol like i said . 
  now , i take no offense that bosnia would adopt it as it 's quite visually appealing . 
  i guess its symbolism could be used a way to unify both serbs and croats under the common flag as of the common nation that 's void of their respective nationalistic symbols . 
  then what about these : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/64t1k3/best_friend_of_europe_from_space_mexico/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/64rddh/european_countries_from_space_australia/, 
  you seem to have none actually , this girl deserves to be punished for whatever is that she did . 
  it 's originally a frankish symbol , even charlemagne himself used it . 
  this wo n't backfire , not at all . 
  should have gone with crono for croatia and pull-land for poland . 
  the country of serbs , croats and french . . wait what ? 
  just say the word . 
  you deflected his blow like a true roman . 
  bling .

  asking the real questions, 
  pay debt !, 
  that came out wrong . 
  it was n't my intention to imply that balkans were a single nation , but rather that by quantifiable metrics one could conclude that they are , by far , the most butthurt region in europa . 
  that would be the balkans actually .
