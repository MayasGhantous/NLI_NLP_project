  the entire place is an extremely violent , poor shithole . 
  an utter mess of a continent , very much like africa . 
  ales and porters                       lager hence forth i voted for the uk . 
  lager is lager really so the vast majority of continental beers do nothing for me . 
  whether germany , holland , czech republic , belgium etc its all a much of muchness . 
  of course polish society is , they are the biggest receipetents of eu funds after all . 
  poland loves all that eu money , all that german , british and french cash . 
  without which their country would still be a irrelevent , tinpot , backwater 3rd world dump . 
  if i got lots of no-strings attached , never payback , free money i 'd love the eu as well , who wouldnt . 
  all this lofty talk & pretentions otherwise is just that . 
  its actually all about the $ $ $ $ $ \u00a5 \u00a5 \u00a5 # # # , nothing more . 
  that 's what it comes down to at the end of the day . 
  always has done . 
  not here in uk . 
  even though the romans were here for close to 400 years ( 43ad-410ad ), 
  its very meaty . 
  ** reasons against mgm ** ** 1 . 
  ** women prefer intact penises ** 2 ** masturbation feels better ** 3 ** circumcision significantly reduces sensitivity ** 4 ** cut men have a more difficult time masturbating . 
  which was the reason it was promoted in the usa in the first place ** 5 ** circumcision increases risk of erectile dysfunctions ** 6 ** if too much skin is removed in circumcision , it can make the penis smaller since the dong needs some skin to expand during an erection . 
  ** 7 ** circumcision does not lower the risk of aids ** 8 ** the idea that ` circumcision is more hygienic ' : who the fuck does n't clean their dick ? 
  it 's a three second job you do when you shower so this is not a valid argument . 
  women produce 10 times as much smegma as men - so it 's ok to amputate an infant girls ' labia lips so she does n't have to wash them ?? 
  ** 9 ** circumcised foreskin sold to cosmetic manufacturers for profit ** 10 ** erectile dysfunction 4.5 times more likely to occur if you 're circumcised ** 11 ** stanford 's school of medicine links circumcision to many complications ( including infection , haemorraging , skin-bridging , phimosis , amputation and death ) ** 12 ** cut infants get long-term changes in pain response from the trauma of being circumcised ** 13 ** circumcision decreases penile sensitivity : ** 14 ** circumcision associated with sexual difficulties : ** 15 ** circumcision is linked to alexithymia ** 16 ** circumcision ablates the most sensitive parts of the penis . 
  ** 17 ** the exaggeration of the benefits of circumcision in regards to hiv/aids transmission ** 18 ** circumcision/hiv claims are based on insufficient evidence ** 19 ** there is no case for the widespread implementation of circumcision as a preventative measure to stop transmission of aids/hiv ** 20 ** circumcision decreases sexual pleasure : ** 21 ** circumcision decreases efficiency of nerve response in the glans of the penis ** 22 ** circumcision policy is influenced by psychosocial factors rather than alleged health benefits ** 23 ** circumcision linked to pain , trauma , and psychosexual sequelae ** 24 ** circumcision results in significant loss of erogenous tissue ** 25 ** neonatal circumcision is linked to pain and trauma ** 26 ** circumcision may lead to need for increased care and medical attention in the first 3 years of life ** 27 ** circumcision is linked to psychological trauma : ** 28 ** circumcision may lead to abnormal brain development and subsequent deviations in behavior ** 29 ** numorous studies confirms the importance of the foreskin for penile sensitivity , overall sexual satisfaction , and penile functioning . 
  furthermore , many studies shows that a higher percentage of circumcised men experience discomfort or pain and unusual sensations as compared with the uncircumcised population . 
  ** 30 ** circumcision is associated with frequent orgasm difficulties in danish men and with a range of frequent sexual difficulties in women , notably orgasm difficulties , dyspareunia and a sense of incomplete sexual needs fulfilment . 
  ** 31 ** there is a decrease in masturbatory pleasure and sexual enjoyment after circumcision , indicating that adult circumcision adversely affects sexual function in many men , possibly because of complications of the surgery and a loss of nerve endings . 
  ** 32 ** the glans of the circumcised penis is faaaar less sensitive if not completely unresponsive to fine touch than the glans of the uncircumcised penis . 
  the transitional region from the external to the internal prepuce is the most sensitive region of the uncircumcised penis and more sensitive than the most sensitive region of the circumcised penis . 
  circumcision ablates the most sensitive parts of the penis . 
   male circumcision , while nowhere near as damaging or harmful as female circumcision your wrong there . 
  you do know they 're many different kinda of fgm . 
  and in infact the most common kind is actually much less damaging than ordinary male circumcision . 
  so why is fgm banned but mgm ? . 
  why are girls allowed the right to bodily integrity backed up by the law , but boys arent given the same rights ? . 
  we all know why , and the double standard and hypocricy is sickening . 
  absolutely revolting . 
  people should be angry about this . 
  this is violent , barbaric child abuse , yet the powers that be dont care : / . 
  the hms queen elizabeth . . 
  it sounds rather obselete tbh . 
  i mean if they actually wanted this to be useful and actually practical etc. . then it would have catapults and an angled deck , so it could launch support aircraft too ( awacs , tankers and the like ) instead of just f-35s and helicopters . 
  but as ever it was not done simply to cut costs . 
  but at this already huge pricetag an extra billion ( funny enough about the same for 10 dup seats ) is pocket change really , and would 've added so much more value to the carrier . 
  but as ever its more halfassed-ness from those in charge . 
  this is a waste of money as it stands . 
  i was gonns say the same thing . 
  and its not just looks either . 
  i mean for instance there is actually a male height pay gap as well ( as on average a short man will get payed less , earn significantly less than a tall man , and he will be less likely to be promoted as the tall guy as well etc ) . 
  there have been studies done which have prooven this to be true . 
  oh but it was . 
  it was made by the cider maker called brothers ( of somerset since 1995 ) , made specifically for aldi for the summer etc. 
  it may not be the king of ciders aka scrumpy . . 
  but goddamn it was pretty damn good , lush af . 
  their toffee apple flavour makes me pre a little as well . 
  as a brexit voter ( with no regrets ) . . i had a rhubarb and custard flavour pear somerset cider to celebrate this special day , this innagural idependence day as it were . 
  feels good man , cheers !, 
  * bottle clink *, 
  man finland the netherlands ... would you guys just get a room and fuck already ! . 
  i read a article about a man who got sepsis and almost died all because of a ladybird bite on his hand . 
  i never knew ladybirds could be so deadly , but they can be . 
  plus here in the uk they also carry all sorts of stds , im not joking . 
  yes , i copied my comment , my pov into the relevent subs that also have this article ( only 2 other subs ) . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  its the done thing on a public forum . 
  it doesnt make me a `` serial copy paster '' in the slightest . 
  im not gon na retype my whole comment just to post it in two other subs , nobody would . 
  my big belly , cock and chubby body vs your big butt , pussy and chubby body ... who 'd win ? . . 
  there 's only one way to find out  . 
  though i know the answer : we 'd both be winners ~  . 
  superb as ever ! . 
  i know i often wax lyrical about your arse . . but hottdamn, 
  this makes me incredibly angry , because the fact is we owe the eu precisely $ 0 . 
  and that 's an end of it . 
  though if the eu wants to pursue this . . then it should be noted that the uk ( as the 2nd biggest net contributor ) has major , major big shares , investment and ownership rights in many eu instituations and projects . 
  we have every right to recall all that back to britain/and or be reimbursed in full . 
  also only germany & france ( being the other 2 biggest main net contributors ) have any right to talk . 
  everybody else should stfu to be frank . 
  we have every right to simply ignore the lesser , `` take take '' moocher nations and thier demands . 
  they are an irrelevance . 
  but to clarify . . we owe the eu $ 0 . 
  there is no $ 60 billion let alone $ 100 billion as has been the figures floating around lately . . its $ 0 . 
  that 's what we owe them . 
  a bbw + a bhm = a match made in heaven in my book  . 
  i know i often wax lyrical about your amazing arse , but damn those feet are just as gorgeous . 
  soles and toes to die for ! . 
  i could spend all night licking and dicking them feet before i even got to said beautiful arse . 
  hot , sexy feet ! . 
  you could sit on my face any time , sit on my face and grind on it  . 
  certainly the perfect position for such here in this pic . 
  hot pose ! . 
  absolute beauty ! . 
  your one chubby , portly stud . 
  a hot fucker ! . 
  looking good mate  . 
  now idk what i 'd rather lick first , that belly , that lovely cock or them sexy feet ... hmm quite the hard decision ~ . 
  the one thing i know for certain is just how incredibly hot you are . 
  holy beefcake ! . 
  what a super stud muffin you are . 
  man your making me drool outta my mouth and my cock ! ~ .
