  moreover , the suggestion that we should just forget about the last ww is insane !, 
  why on earth would we deign to dismiss the atrocities of the 20th century ? 
  indeed , i 'd suggest that there needs to be a lot more objective analysis of what happened in europe/russia during the 20th century - particularly the crimes of communism and fascism . 
  idk , i do n't want to pass judgement or make any assumptions about you personally , but the last part of your response read a little too much like a pamphlet for me to really engage with it . 
  that 's understandable , i 'll admit that was slightly exaggerated and not especially articulate of me . 
  i 'm not rewriting history at all ( or at least that 's not my intent ) . 
  the popular consensus seems today to be that everybody was vehemently opposed to the ~ ~ germany ~ ~ germans in the '30s and '40s - which simply was n't the case . 
  and , 
   try talking like a man coming from a chap who has just said `` you got to be kidding me '' and `` wannabe street kid '' ? 
  i 'm more than happy to converse in french , if you 'd prefer . 
  and yes , the nazis did draw a * significant * amount of popular support throughout europe . 
  i am not contending that the majority of europe heralded the nazis as the preference ; the majority of germany did n't . 
  this is not specific to france , i was merely illustrating some points where they evidenced an admiration for germany 's current political turmoil and the ensuing fallout ( national socialism ) . 
  i 'll reiterate : at no point have i proclaimed the french were fascist , or pro-hitler - at least not in the absolute terms you seem to think i am . 
  and it 's parli * a * ment * ( sorry , nobody likes the language police ) . 
  haha yeah , that 's laughable that you got banned . 
  the people on the_donald can be equally as precious as the snowflakes they claim to oppose - which is precisely why it 's amusing !, 
  they post a lot of genuine stuff , some stuff that 's been skewed to a narrative , and some stuff which is just outrageous . 
  so does / r/europe ( and do n't even get me started on the well of pseudo-intellectualism that is / r/politics ... ) . 
  in any event , my initial comments were purely poking fun at sweden , and i think you can appreciate i 'm not * actually * surprised that it still exists , or that i believe i 'd be raped there ( but i * am * pretty hot , so who knows ) . 
  out of sincere curiosity ... on a scale of `` it 's a majority swede country with an entrenched culture '' to `` everybody is an immigrant and mosques are popping out of the ground '' , how would you personally describe sweden today ? 
  what sort of issues/problems hound you , as a swede ? 
  the french were all over germany 's dick when the nazi party was on the rise . 
  a significant portion of europe was cheering them in - not just the germans . 
  what 's more , is that thousands of frenchmen , dutchmen , danes , etc. 
  actually signed up for the ss and other sects of the nazi military . 
  it was considered a good career , and you got to be on the right side of history ( or so they thought ) . 
  thankfully people woke up and smelled the coffee , * but * france had already made some terrible errors leading up to this , hence why there was so little resistance to the nazis when they invaded . 
  ( i 'm not bashing france , believe me ) . 
  you 've lost me a bit there . 
   when did i dismiss your opinions as wrong ? 
  `` do n't come here '' struck me as an expression of disdain for merely attending a subreddit every now and then that you clearly abhor . 
  you 've stated that you agree that i can read and write wherever i please , so we 'll move past that . 
   something about `` i never mentioned right or left '' well , you did implicitly . 
  suggesting that i 'm a `` dweller '' who does n't belong `` here '' seems to be a fairly clean-cut dichotomy that you 're trying to establish , suggesting that this sub is one side of the aisle , and subs like the_donald are the yin to / r/europe 's yang . 
  my only point is this : you 're all as insightful , absurd , sweet , and hilarious as each other . 
  and seriously - go on the_donald . 
  they 're not racists , they 're not nazis . 
  it 's just a bit of toxic shitposting and memetic speech . 
  expand your mind m ^ a ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ n. 
   our partner , ally and friend to make a stronger europe and to make a better life for our people in our countries my point being that `` allies '' and `` friends '' can quickly turn , that 's all . 
   that would be so much better if we could sold our soul to overlord trump and kiss the ass of every wannabe dictator begging for their money like the french did with hitler . 
  the hundred years war never ended . 
  ** remember agincourt **, 
  wait ... 
  so i 'm not allowed to have a voice in this forum because i try to practice pluralism ? 
  or perhaps you 're a bigot who dismisses other people 's opinions as inherently * wrong * ? 
  that seems very uncharacteristically intolerant coming from a the bastion of equality , sweden . 
  ( that 's a joke , do n't worry ) . 
  and yeah , london is insane . 
  that video gives me chills . 
  come on , dude . 
  who gives a fuck if i frequent the right and the left ? 
  i 'm not an ideologue ; i simply enjoy observing apes behaving like apes . 
  edit : seriously , go and talk to somebody over on that sub . 
  why would n't you ? 
  ah , i may have misinterpreted him . 
  i still disagree , however . 
  radical muslims tend to stand out more in madrid or oslo , where their beliefs are insufferable and juxtaposed to the nation 's laws and culture . 
  in karachi , marrakesh , baghdad , mosul ... it 's a little harder to tell the wood from the trees . 
  `` not * as * radical '' ... 
  i grasp your point , and i know you mean it in a constructive way , but i do n't invest anything in these sorts of quixotic sentiments . 
  an honour killing in pakistan is equally abhorrent as an honour killing in iraq . 
  remember when france snuggled up to their buddy at the berlin olympics , doing that wacky goosestep move the germans loved , and waving the flags of national socialism ? 
  germany took the country in less than a month . 
  ( totally off-topic , but always worth remembering ) . 
  make the thirteen colonies great again . 
  sweden still exists ? 
   at least in the middle east said nobody , ever . 
  the very term ` feminism ' necessitates an emphasis on sex/gender . 
  it 's like me starting a group for racial equality and calling the movement `` equal whites '' . 
  in common parlance , the labels `` liberalism '' and `` progressivism '' in the us will be met with open ridicule . 
  those words might have meant something thirty , forty , fifty years ago , but not today . 
  it 's laughable . 
  cheers !, 
  is that a hand dropping a bottle ? 
  top left ? 
  thy fucking want some , pal ? 
  inglund ? 
  i think you mean ** ingerlund ** , m8 . 
   british white trash what 's * race * got to do with it , eh ?

  and an observant spaniard . 
  did somebody say sitcom !, 
  i 'd never leave work again . 
  so you 're basically saying that if you lived in a bad neighbourhood , you 'd refuse to work ? 
   one of the first threads i read was a highly upvoted , grandiosely delivered speech written by someone emploring us to `` think european thoughts '' that 's equal parts depressing , scary , and hilarious . 
  and then we need to attend to those bloody work-shy greeks !, 
  few too many pints . 
  way to stereotype the irish ... feck . 
  lolllll, 
  whoops , i shot my load a little too quickly there . 
  nothing ? 
  here 's what you * could * have said : politicians forecasting economic turmoil in a region ( or regions ) can indeed affect democracy , insofar as elections and referenda . 
  by positing that `` x currency will be doomed '' , the individual making the statement knows well that their audience will interpret this as valid and/or worthy of note . 
  for example , let 's suppose that there is an upcoming election in portugal , and the parties leading the race , p and g , are nearing the end of their respective campaigns . 
  the race is very close . 
  p 's main running points are that portugal needs its own national currency . 
  g advocates stronger and `` ever closer union '' . 
  the notion of portugal having a national currency upsets g 's agenda .
