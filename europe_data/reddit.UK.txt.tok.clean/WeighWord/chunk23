  moreover , i would suspect any such test would only be rolled out to those already on a ` list ' , or those suspected of being fundamentalist . 
   homosexuality has been illegal in many countries since a few decades ago . 
  many countries still do n't have gay marriage . 
  many people consider it absolutely wrong . 
  so who would decide where the acceptable opinion ends and the unacceptable opinion starts ? 
  it does n't matter what your opinion of homosexuality is ; what matters is how you believe homosexuals should be treated and regarded in society . 
  the purpose would be to ascertain how muslims would ` handle ' homosexuals , if they had the choice . 
  we 're perfectly fine with educating other people on diversity courses , promoting homosexuality as part of the fabric of our societies , yet we largely refuse to apply this to the muslim community . 
  many christians disagree with homosexuality and frown upon it ; the majority of muslims think it is punishable . 
   treat non-muslims the same as muslims if they held the same opinion yup . 
  i think this would be correct . 
  if you express views which stipulate that homosexuals should be punished or persecuted for their sexual orientation , your religion or lack thereof does n't really matter . 
  the point is it is that this is a growing problem which is increasingly prevalent in the muslim community . 
   deporting you 're own citizens for an opinion is practically impossible an also the end of being a liberal country . 
  it 's a huge contradiction , i know . 
  however , locking a person away for posting a video extolling the virtues of nazism ( as abhorrent as it may be ) is equally restrictive , yet it 's commonly accepted as the correct thing to do . 
  the point is n't about the opinion in and of itself , it 's more to do with how the person manifests their belief in everyday life , and how much that belief is likely to contribute to criminal behaviour . 
   so outlawing a whole religion . 
  would that mean incarcerating or deporting everyone practising ? 
  and calling yourself liberal country ? 
  i 'll backtrack on that - i spoke too quickly perhaps . 
  i would n't outright ban a religion , but , like i mentioned previously , if that religion is clearly dearer to you than to your fellow countrymen and the integrity of society , then you pose a threat to said people . 
  islam is a very difficult example , because a lot of muslims practice the more benign aspects of the religion whilst only supporting some of the more hateful aspects . 
  wash yourself , pray , read the texts , eat halal , but do it off your own back , in your own time , and in the appropriate place ( which is nowhere beyond your home or your place of worship ) . 
  this of course also brings into question the definition of ` no true muslim ' . 
  if you 're practising , say , 10 % of the qur ` an 's teachings and they 're in private , do n't directly infringe on another person 's life , then whatever . 
  if , however , you 're practising 90 % of islam , you are absolutely infringing on other people 's rights and likely committing atrocities . 
  idk , i understand i 'm basically calling for an inquisition , it 's not ideal , it would tarnish our society , but it 's preferable to the current attitude of combating an extremely violent and incorrigible ideology with candles , songs , and empty gestures of solidarity . 
  i 'd rather lose the sails of the ship than steer it into rocks . 
  well , why not ? 
  they 'd be required to take the survey , and they 'd be informed in advance that all answers must be answered under oath . 
  even if they changed their views and these ` new ' views now lay in contradiction to the appropriate attitude , then they 're explicitly admitting incompatibility and would be relocated to a society which accommodates their beliefs better . 
  such a test would be riddled with problems , i agree , but unless we start attempting such approaches we 'll never develop them to be increasingly effective . 
  it has to be achieved incrementally , i think . 
  ask a muslim to draw a picture of mohammed . 
  if the muslim does so willingly and without issue , then they 're demonstrating that they are n't zealous or islamist and are westerners . 
  if the muslim expresses disapproval , but nonetheless capitulates , then they are exhibiting their ability to sideline their religion in order to function in western society . 
  they have chosen our way of life over another . 
  if a muslim refuses , then they are displaying favour for their religion over western ideals , and will be deported . 
  if a muslim not only refuses , but becomes incensed or violent , then they are clearly showing their potential for volatility and an abject disassociation with western values . 
  if a muslim conforms and then later goes on to do the exact opposite , then they are guilty of perjury and will be banished from the country . 
  if the muslim outright refuses to answer any of the questions , then they will have no legal rebuttal to rely on and will be assumed to be a threat to society . 
  i 'm not a legislator , nor am i claiming that the above is an ironclad solution . 
  however , some sort of vetting process to determine the cohesion of people within a society has to be implemented . 
  the simple truth is that if you wish to live in a western secular society , then you * have * to be willing to sacrifice religious rights that you would otherwise be allowed in other countries . 
  to expect ( for example ) the british law to adapt to preparing halal food everywhere is an absolute disgrace , and is an attack on british values . 
  if you move to a country , or you were born there with parents from a different background , then you adapt and integrate to the country ; the state does not adapt and cater to you . 
  should immigrants be subject to such a test ? 
  without a shadow of a doubt - it 's a travesty that europe has wholly neglected to make any attempt at this thus far ( particularly within the eu , at least ) . 
  should muslims born/living in europe be subject to this ? 
  yes . 
  it is n't a nice idea , it will offend some people 's feelings , but it is absolutely necessary for the safety and harmony of all involved . 
  to further the example re attitudes to homosexuality , it is perfectly fine for somebody to express their disapproval of being gay ; it is absolutely unacceptable , however , if said individual would seek to make legislation outlawing or punishing homosexuals . 
  anybody who expresses the desire to do so is incompatible with the society and its people , ergo they are corrosive to the fabric of the society . 
  let 's be honest - installing systems like this is far from perfect , but it is tenfold better than burying our heads in the sand and being crippled by the fear of offending a particular group . 
  get these people to express their beliefs as clearly and extensively as possible , and then we can decide what to do with them ( personally , i 'd deport them . 
  incarcerating them exacerbates the problem and costs taxpayers ) . 
  the truth is that we can only be liberal so long as that liberalism is entrenched and protected at all costs - if we have to outlaw islam and have a ` constitutional crisis ' over it , then so be it . 
  if you think drawings are offensive and are punishable with bloodshed , then you are , prima facie , a threat to western people . 
   states do n't have a right to punish their citizens for an opinion in your own country , germany , it is a criminal offence to deny or revise the holocaust . 
  in my own country , england , we have plenty of laws restricting and criminalising opinion . 
  consider the ` belfast cake scandal ' , where a catholic couple who owned a bakery refused to bake a cake promoting gay marriage . 
  they were arrested . 
  there are mountains of research that show british muslims find homosexuality to be immoral , inexcusable , and punishable . 
  mosques are quite open about their disdain for homosexuals . 
  nothing happens , the government just stresses our need to respect their wishes . 
  establish a litmus test . 
  `` what is your opinion on homosexuality ? 
  how would you react to a family member coming out ? '', 
  `` is freedom of speech more important than blasphemy against your prophet ? '', 
  `` how does this photo of mohammed and his boyfriend make you feel ? '', 
  `` do you consider the propagation of islam to be important ? '', 
  `` do you think the uk would be better suited with a higher muslim population ? '', 
  `` how would you respond to a family member if they became an apostate ? '', 
  `` do you believe islamic teachings and law are are superior to democracy and secularism ? '', 
  `` does the act of denouncing islam warrant violence ? '', 
  `` do you support , in any way , acts of terrorism ? '', 
  `` do you believe women are entitled to every right and opportunity that men are ? '', 
  `` if you were faced with the choice , would you choose your religion or your children , family , and neighbours ? '', 
  etc. , etc. 
  find out how much their beliefs align with western principles and customs ; if they 're not 95 % + compatible , then arrange for them to go and live in a society where their beliefs are properly shared . 
  a monotheistic , totalitarian monoculture has no place in europe . 
  enough is enough - assimilate or repatriate . 
  `` free speach '' < * sigh * , 
  ` islamophobia ' is a woefully stupid term . 
  stop peddling stock phrases to deflect from the issue . 
  it 's perfectly rational to be way of a barbaric , totalitarian ideology . 
  it 's antithetical to western principles . 
  it is not an irrational fear ; it is our beliefs and way of life actively resisting that of another . 
  we did n't vote for it . 
  we do n't want it . 
  we do n't like it . 
  the us navy was founded for this precise reason . 
  look it up . 
   gangs of different backgrounds for anybody interested , i 'd like to point out that there are no such gangs belonging to different backgrounds . 
  child sexual exploitation rings in the uk are exclusively muslim , and overwhelmingly pakistani . 
  local councils and police have consistently ignored this fact so that they do n't appear ` racist ' . 
  i do n't care to be silenced with the social stigma of being smeared as a ` racist ' ; it does n't matter to me . 
  pakistani communities in britain are an utter failure , and unless people are willing to address it then the problem will persist .
