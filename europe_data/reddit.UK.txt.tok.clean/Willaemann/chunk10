  that said i think the view is mostly of housing estates . 
  pretty ones , but estates nonetheless . 
  gatwick would n't be so bad , if not for the tower blocks that line the railway , or landing near crawley . 
  stuttgart is very german in terms of its efficiency ; 25 minutes from touchdown to flagging down a taxi last time i landed there . 
  helps if you position yourself to be one of the first off the bus from wherever they park the plane ( never had one of those corridors come out to the plane there , dunno if they have them ) , but still . 
  my best experiences with an airport are usually directly related to how late i can arrive safely before my departure , and how fast i can get out when i land there . 
  stanstead is the most depressing place in the south . 
  add to that the fact ( if you 're not from the area ) it feels like you 're in the middle of nowhere , and that you can either experience the trains or a national express bus to get away from it . 
  oh the heady joy . 
  job well done . 
  keep it going , mes amis . 
  haha , i know , it took a lot of effort to not end up sounding like the locals !, 
  i remember when i worked in the civil service , having to do outbound calls where we would have to call the client by their last name . 
  even some names that i assume were british , we would be like `` how the hell do you pronounce that ? '', 
  before calling and would hope for the best . 
  french was the first foreign language i learned ; can confirm german is * much * easier than french . 
  english is a pain in the ass too ; i 'm always impressed that people can grasp it when there are so many irregular words . 
  yes i have been there . 
  i worked in my uncle 's british-owned bar for a summer ; tank top , boardshorts , flipflops , bad haircut and all . 
  * shudders * everyone i met was british . 
  i do n't think i saw a single spanish person there . 
  you had to go inland to find those . 
  i mean in that no matter what the argument , your opinion would n't be swayed , so is it worth me trying to debate ? 
  eusceptic does n't come into that ; plenty of people are eusceptic but can accept there are lots of british people living and working in the reu . 
  unless you 're like farage in terms of `` britishness '' ; he comes across as a `` cooked breakfast , pint of london ale and a roast dinner every day , wherever one is in the world '' sort . 
  the irony that i 'm centre-right ... 
  the eu good for business . 
  a few immigrants here and there is not an issue since it generates growth , brings in foreign money and lowers trade barriers . 
  more than worth the `` cultural '' change , and the british government is too short-term-thinking to ever come up with some of the fantastic ideas the eu has implemented . 
  have you been to the british ghettos where nobody bothers to learn spanish , everyone working in the shops , bars , supermarkets , etc is british , `` no spanish food '' is outside restaurants like a michelin star , and the daily mail is available on demand ? 
  i have a feeling i can guess where the majority are . 
  but your mind is already made up in ukip 's favour so i do n't know why i 'm even bothering . 
  probably working . 
  you know , like * what people who come to britain do * . 
  that 's people from * outside * the eu . 
  the usual ukip argument is that everyone from the eu wants to steal british jobs and benefits . 
  [ they even made it into a poster ] ( http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/41/590x/ukip_poster_racist_eu-471861.jpg ) . 
  however if the same amount are leaving as coming , then the ukip scare story does n't happen . 
  the growth in population comes from outside eu immigrants , of which there are more than emigrants . 
  but its obvious your mind is made up , so i ca n't be bothered debating . 
  i did n't think i needed an / s just using the typical ukip / britain first / daily mail statement against the british people , in the vain hope that * some * of them might see how ludicrous it is . 
  2 million - 2 million = 0 if you 're talking about from * outside * the eu , that 's a different story . 
  i think you fail to understand how net immigration works . 
  2 million brits leave . 
  2 million reu immigrants arrive . 
  the population has not changed . 
  also , other eu countries have immigrants from elsewhere too . 
  french people , germans , italians , spanish , portuguese , poles , etc also move to different countries . 
  it 's what `` freedom of movement '' is all about . 
  but i 've seen in the past that you 're a ukip voter , so i doubt this makes any difference to you . 
  well , at least you 're consistent across nationalities . 
  better than the average ukip voter who thinks they should have a right to live wherever they damn well please , but nobody else should . 
  you mean , they go over there , leech off the health service , never bother to learn the language , and do n't integrate ? 
  bet they also read the daily mail and vote ukip ... 
  stealing benefits , probably . 
  yup , got friends in the prison service who said they know of people who are in there because they 'd rather be in prison than deal with ids 's `` reforms '' . 
  `` at least in prison , i 'm guaranteed food and a roof and can learn a trade instead of being treated like scum '' is the logic . 
  they are n't independent countries , but they are separate nations united under the banner of the united kingdom . 
  i expect perceptions differ quite a bit between say , england and scotland , amongst people around the continent . 
  you also imply that if the euro were to crash , that they would revert to the old currency and not start afresh . 
  really ? 
  i found quite a few of them in my grandfather 's house after he passed away . 
  they 're still in the attic ... 
  i 'm getting out of here . 
  joebidenbot is probably more dangerous than skynet !, 
  probably the theory that the [ royal family had princess diana killed . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_diana,_princess_of_wales_conspiracy_theories ), 
  them *, 
  it 's become self-aware . 
  run !, 
  unless you go to stuttgart where it 's all about the mercedes and porsches . 
  or wolfsburg for vw paradise . 
  i found germans to be pretty disciplined drivers . 
  fast , but disciplined . 
  italians followed by the french have been the most aggressive i have encountered . 
  at least germans do n't try to overtake you on a blind bend . 
  5 working weeks ( so 25 days normally ) + public holidays , and we are closed for business sundays . 
  the longer i stay with the company , the more holiday i get . 
  yes they 're all paid . 
  no it 's not a small company . 
  i always found it odd that prussia held the area around sigmaringen , completely cut off from the rest of it . 
  i 'd assume he was referring to universities , with that comment . 
  our universities , along with the usa , france and germany , do attract some of the best in the world to them . 
  must be the desk person 's choice . 
  the person in hannover was happy with my driver 's license . 
  wrong . 
  [ here 's the bbc channels ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_television_stations_in_the_united_kingdom#bbc ) which come from the license fee , and the [ bbc radio stations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_bbc_radio_stations ) . 
  each caters to a different demographic , so we all get publicly-funded regional news and weather , in addition to locally-produced programs that are often broadcast across the national network . 
  none of them have advertisements , and produce some of the best tv shows in the world ( by number of viewers , obviously it 's subjective ) . 
  sherlock , dr who , top gear , luther , silent witness , the documentaries of david attenborough and many more are bbc originals . 
  in addition to those , government funding also goes to channel 4 group , who do use advertising as well . 
  these channels offer a different kind of entertainment , including reality tv , but does have [ film4 productions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/film4_productions ) under its belt , being a leading supplier of high-quality british movies . 
  so yeah , its worth the cost of `` half your phone bill '', 
  what , having a tv station that makes its own content , and is free of advertising , and much less biased , is stupid as hell , whilst having tv stations that cram adverts in at every available opportunity , are biased to the extreme and have to show absolute favour to corporate sponsors is normal ? 
  in britain at least , publicly funded tv is far superior . 
  [ here 's a few tv shows who 's funding came out of the public purse ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/ariel/26296924 ) . 
  not to mention all of the film4 original films , which had a combination of commercial and government funding . 
  i 'd much rather have these than their american counterparts . 
  normally its just to prove your name is the one on the ticket ; for the airline not the government . 
  i 've done germany  italy with a driver 's license before .
