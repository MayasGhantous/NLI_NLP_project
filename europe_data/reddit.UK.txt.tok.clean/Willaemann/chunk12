  the article this thread is commenting on , for example . 
  so in response to my question ... that 's a no ? 
  it 's quite obvious you 're a lawyer sometimes , dude . 
  is there any reason you would * ever * take as a reason to not leave the eu ? 
  you are the most pro-ukip person here , i 'm pretty sure . 
  it was the closest fit on the spectrum that came to mind . 
  i personally prefer le monde . 
  what ? 
  i thought we would be able to pay no money , approve no eu laws , close the borders , and still get full ground in negotiations and be the major negotiator ? 
  you mean they * lied * to us ? 
  impossible . 
  this is left wing liberal media bias by eu shills to discredit the eurosceptic movement . 
  i would take the independent if you want a less business-centric view . 
  they 're pretty centrist . 
  sigh , such a narrow sighted view ( those scaremongering , paid ukip shills ? 
  utiopian pensioners who dream of a bygone era ? ) ... 
  is it really hard to fathom the world will not end iof the uk decide to leave the eu , but the uk will feel a lot more like the 1950s , including a lot of lost trade and influence because the rest of the world has moved on and the british empire is no more ? 
  the uk wo n't take any option that allows anything other than very strictly `` controlled '' movement . 
  so i do n't see any relationship even in the region of what it has presently . 
  it might take that to make the populists and nativists realise that immigration is not the be all and end all . 
  they also forget that the uk wo n't have a free trade agreement with the eu as a whole , because the `` british population '' , spurred on by the daily mail et al , will be too nativist to allow any agreement which would include freedom of movement . 
  bye bye finance sector . 
  switzerland and frankfurt will thank them for the business . 
  thats the old telegraph . 
  the new telegraph is down with the daily mail , bild , le figaro , etc. 
  still in broadsheet format , and with more high-brow language , but as right-wing populist as the others . 
  i guess they 're having their `` now i am become death , the destroyer of worlds '' regret after putting ukip on a pedestal for years . 
  pity they did n't realise it sooner . 
  the fact that all it takes is one minor mistake , inlcuding mistakes made by dwp staff themselves , to get someone sanctioned for weeks to * nothing * . 
  the fact that [ doing this over silly things ] ( http://stupidsanctions.tumblr.com/ ) ( eg , being late because the bus broke down , with proof in hand that the bus did ) is now seen as completely acceptable . 
  the fact that the printed media has convinced the public this is okay , because after all , everyone on benefits is portrayed as subhuman , vile , or lazy , and should all be treated as such in the eyes of this media . 
  the fact people are now on such low amounts of money that they are [ having to turn to charity . 
  ] ( http://www.trusselltrust.org/foodbank-figures-top-900000 ) the fact the government , rather than fixing it , [ is advising them to go to charity . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/11/food-bank-jobcentre-dwp-referrals-welfare ) [ this delightful list of the people ids has driven to suicide with his `` popular '' reforms . 
  ] ( http://blacktrianglecampaign.org/2014/10/21/uk-welfare-reform-deaths-updated-list-october-21st-2014/ ) interestingly enough , even [ the newspaper that demanded these changes ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2117718/british-people-committing-suicide-escape-poverty-is-state-wants.html ) has seen what it has done . 
  even [ mps are admitting it ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/benefit-sanctions-might-just-be-about-punishing-the-unemployed-mps-warn-10130199.html ) . 
  do n't get me wrong , there are some fraudulent claimants , but when did it become okay to treat everyone who is unemployed like they are * untermensch * in order to catch these few ? 
  that would be what i do n't like . 
  as for teaching , i am considering teaching english abroad as a way into another country . 
  i would quite enjoy teaching as a career having tried it out in a secondary school , but i have seen the way the uk system is going and i do n't like it . 
  beyond that , i would rather make use of my ability to travel most of the planet without a visa , and i never like staying in one place for too long . 
  i 'm single , have the funds , and no real attachment to anywhere as an individual beyond where my parents live . 
  it would be nice to see the world . 
  ids and his `` reforms '' are the reason i left the civil service . 
  the stress of the job has gone up tenfold with ids about , and those reports are right , you do get `` points '' with management for being a sadist . 
  the complaints , suicide threats , death threats , and whatever else are a daily occurrence now , but hey , the right wing press got what it wanted . 
  people on benefits are now second only to immigrants in terms of being the most vilified people in the country . 
  gove is the one who took everything that was great about being a teacher and got rid of it . 
  people are leaving the profession as a direct result of him . 
  i do n't care what their opinions on the eu are . 
  i 'm against the idea of leaving for a start , but even if they were in favour of staying , they 're the sort of endorsement nobody wants . 
  like nick griffin , or paul golding . 
  we all know you 're one of the most anti-eu people here , but you ca n't tell me you honestly think people outside of the daily mail 's readership are happy with the vicious way that those two have ripped through the country . 
  i once held hopes of training to be a teacher once my time with dwp was over , but what those two have done has put me off * ever * wanting to do that in the uk . 
  i 'd rather go abroad and teach english now . 
  they 've done enough damage to the uk as it is . 
  one hopes that ids will be one of the first casualties , along with michael gove . 
  there is no way them leaving government would be a negative thing ; massive eusceptic or otherwise . 
  you wish . 
  i believe that ukip are polling on around ... 10-15 % ? 
  they could n't even get a full house with the pathetically small ep election turnout . 
  you might get farage and maybe 5 more mps . 
  you 're lucky you have that long . 
  we have two months . 
  i 'm a little nervous . 
  the daily mail 's readership call for it to be brought back quite regularly . 
  it 's not just france . 
  hopefully france will see her for what she is before it 's too late . 
  had an interesting chat with an american about this . 
  i feel bad for you guys when it comes to people saying `` eurgh , america is getting involved where it does n't belong '' , but if they do n't they get `` eurgh , america should do something . '', 
  actually , europe has a lot to thank america for . 
  we just do n't like showing that we are thankful ;-), 
  they asked the people who live there , ie , the people it actually matters to , which country they would rather be a part of . 
  they did n't ask the people of britain , or argentina . 
  only the islanders . 
  they chose britain . 
  totally fair . 
  [ from new statesman ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/03/was-falklands-referendum-most-unanimous-election-ever ) . 
  she even sounds exactly like we would expect . 
  i remember people in vegas begging me to `` not judge america on honey boo boo or her family '' . 
  oh piss off argentina . 
  we had a referendum , it came back in britain 's favour . 
  personally if they want to leave the uk , its up to them . 
  i would n't be too fussed either way . 
  but you ca n't just * take * it without some resistance . 
  i 'm all in favour of protesting farage for his views ; but it should be done in a non-violent manner when he 's giving a speech , or on the campaign trail , or making a public appearance , without intimidating his wife or children . 
  sunday lunch with the family is ** sacred ** . 
  it does n't matter how much i love or hate someone , i would never disturb them on a sunday when they 're trying to have lunch with their family . 
  if anything , they 've managed to fuel the ukip fire with this faux-pas . 
  i hope so too , which makes me pretty alone in the uk . 
  theres something in the british mentality that makes it want to stand alone against the world . 
  london ? 
  you 'll love it . 
  london is european , it 's the rest of the country that 's having more of an identity crisis ;-) . 
  a lot of what you read is media bias . 
  the daily mail is the worst of british in printed form , the sun is n't much better , nor the express or telegraph . 
  if you want a better view of britain , try the independent . 
  the dwp will thank you for their additional workload !, 
  its predominantly personal ; my so is from schwaben in germany , as is my best friend , and the majority of those i choose to be around socially are also german . 
  beyond that , yes , i 've had offers from hugo boss , daimler , porsche , telekom , and others .
