  portugese men ; * what * are you ? 
  is that your final form ? 
  not to mention the daily mail . 
  there is * nothing * that farage could say or do that would turn their readership off him , even if the paper itself is officially conservative . 
  it 's an alright city on the mediterranean coast . 
  if it 's not your thing , you can get an easy transfer train to nice or barcelona . 
  austria and sweden are around here somewhere , netherlands too . 
   we 're not the only nation that flocks to shitty resorts in spain over summer . 
  * glares at germany *, 
   that 's limited to the southern part of germany . 
  in the words of my friend ( who is from nordrhein-westfalen ) ; `` bayern is 90 % of german stereotypes , and 100 % of the negative german stereotypes '' . 
  to me , even those brutalist structures remind me of dystopian visions of the future from sci-fi films . 
  the burj khalifa does look a little too `` corporate '' to me too . 
  and here . 
  britain has some overseas territories that have been rather `` relaxed '' in the past , although they are apparently cleaning up their image nowadays . 
  the world 's super-rich tax evaders could pool some of their money together and buy saint-barth ? 
  modern architecture comprised of polished steel and glass can be beautiful . 
  i find something very striking about the shard , for example ; both inside and out . 
  brutalism however should be removed from history as quickly as possible . 
  that 's the badger ; i wrote that before my morning coffee . 
  russian baroque architecture is stunning . 
  london is closer if you like rain and smog . 
  berlin is great if you like culture , counter culture , and nightlife . 
  maybe not the prettiest city , and i personally prefer a southern hefeweizen to a northern pils , but berlin certainly has its attractions . 
  there 's no nightclubs , so where are the group of blokes from < insert industrial town  going to go to get hammered before having a fight with the locals in the street , pissing in a fountain , and passing out on a park bench before waking up and demanding a full english breakfast and `` none of that foreign rubbish '' ? 
  the facilities ( or lack of ) there will keep it to a certain sort of customer , even if it is cheap to get to . 
  if this is your kind of place , i would n't worry too much about it getting smashed up whilst benidorm , zante , magaluf , malia , marbella and rimini continue to exist :-), 
  username checks out . 
  i know it 's not old by our standards , i just wanted to clarify that i meant imperial architecture and not soviet brutalist architecture . 
  the older architecture ( the winter palace , for example ) , the literature , the nature , the music and the friends it has given me . 
  yup , people forget that this country has used [ concentration camps ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_boer_war ) in the past , for example . 
  not to mention what the [ east india company ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_india_company ) did in britain 's name in the past . 
  i feel rather more comfortable with the british government having to answer to a higher power . 
  idiocy is not limited by age . 
  i 've worked in customer service , dude ; idiocy can be found in all age brackets . 
  it would work to the pro-eu side 's advantage to lower the age limit , and the anti-eu sides to keep it as is , or raise it . 
  each side has something to gain from this so of course there is debate . 
  you should be interested in what all party leaders have to say about it . 
  obviously your decision on in/out was decided long ago ; but many people are faced with a choice they never thought they would have to make . 
  politicians and the media can swing these things , and * nobody * is above point-scoring to get the response they want . 
  because its ownership is dominated by a few men ; most of whom are very heavily against the eu and would see it destroyed to relax the laws on their media empires . 
  rupert murdoch and the barclay brothers come to mind in particular . 
  i expect that 's even more true nowadays ; this was * before * 5 years of dave ... 
  well some non-british people living here and working here and having a vested interest are not allowed to vote , whilst others are allowed to . 
  surely it should be `` everybody '' or `` nobody '' ; depending on which side of the argument you 're on . 
  cameron is pro-eu , the only reason he would n't want it like the scottish referendum , where all residents were allowed to vote , is to appease his more right wing back benchers , potential ukip defectors , and the printed media . 
  he used to use the eu to bash labour , and did n't expect anyone to take it seriously . 
  now ukip are a thing , farage is n't going to let it go , and he has to hold a referendum . 
  he will do everything in his power to stay in ; this is beyond his control because it will be a media field day . 
  you can see the headlines already had he let reu citizens resident in the uk vote : `` foreigners allowed to decide britains future '' and what not . 
  the commonwealth tends to be allowed because of historical connections , so he can get away with allowing them . 
  but why should commonwealth people be allowed to vote , but not reu citizens resident in the uk then ? 
  why not all people resident in the uk , or british citizens only ? 
  as i said on the / r/unitedkingdom sub : i can see why he had to do it , even if i disagree . 
  if he 'd let non-british people vote , farage would have been infront of the tv cameras within * minutes * shouting about how * foreigners * who lack * british values * are being allowed to vote on * british * matters for * british people * , and therefore if you `` believe in britain '' you must vote `` out '' immediately . 
  obviously if you 're an eu immigrant , you 're almost certainly going to vote `` stay in '' . 
  commonwealth folks are not so clear-cut . 
  the sun , daily mail , torygraph and express would have felt like christmas had come early . 
  to be fair , one possibility would be a letter to the academy of fine arts in vienna 's admission board , telling them its in everyone 's best interests to accept hitler onto their drawing course . 
  a better option would be to tell the french and british to not be so harsh on germany after wwi . 
  might be able to avoid wwii that way . 
  i think if you gave british people a choice between that or the eu ; many of them would rip your arm off for what you have just presented . 
  ca n't say the other states would be so thrilled , however . 
  what 's holding back germany ? 
  i 'm going to assume it 's the csu . 
  they apparently class ukip as major now , but nobody else wants to drag the country away . 
  it 's the writing style of the exit signs . 
  those are typical fonts in britain and greece . 
  [ here 's the traditional german fonts , since you asked . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/rudolf_koch_gebrochene_schriften.png ) i have a few older german books printed in these styles . 
  thanks to european integration , farage 's wife is n't even british anymore !, 
  * watch me . 
  it 's dave 's nightmare and the day farage 's entire ( political ) life has been leading up to . 
  they 've had to appease him and the people who will likely vote for him with a referendum , and * nobody * can see how it will turn out . 
  i 'm quite worried , to say the least . 
  es ist mein schlimmster alptraum * agreed , its only a dream for nigel . 
  it 's my worst nightmare . 
  whilst you are right , it never was just a monetary union , do n't think that this is an island where farage is worshipped as a god , and everyone wants secession from the entire universe because it 's `` lacking british values '' or whatever other fascistic bullshit . 
  we are * not * a nation of daily mail readers . 
  i hate david cameron and nigel farage with a passion , i never voted for any of them , and am someone who believes very much in the eu , as is / u/limitlessltd and many others . 
  david cameron has never spoken for me , does not intend to speak for me , and never will do so . 
  exactly . 
  whilst i am far from impoverished , i am not the 1 % , so the conservative party and the `` british electorate '' as some would say , want me to bend over for the next 5 years . 
  because nigel farage is a brash and rude person ? 
  the sort of person who appeals to a certain demographic , typically found on the southern coast of england . 
  well if the majority want it gone , then i 've given what i believe would be the acceptable response . 
  a threat to a core tenet of the eu should be treated accordingly as a threat to the fabric of the union , particularly when the other 27 states do not want that tenet to be removed . 
  a union like the eu will not function as intended without freedom of movement , so if those people would rather stop immigration , then they should not be entitled to any of the eu 's benefits , since they want to rip apart the base upon which the eu stands . 
  any state that wants to take away a fundamental right of the eu should be asked to leave , particularly when the other 27 are in unanimous favour of it . 
  what is the point of having a member that refuses to subscribe to core principles , demanding special treatment ? 
  you would n't do it with a team , or at work , so why should this be any different ? 
  so if the uk * actually * wants to destroy the right to freely live and work wherever people want in the union ; one of the core tenets ; then so be it . 
  it should be shown where the door is , and asked if it wants to stay inside and get on with it , or leave . 
  i ** highly ** doubt that is the case , however . 
  you 're right , oops . 
  i need to turn on spellcheck . 
  you 're right , if the kippers had their way , the reu would be entitled to have us treated like the uk treats people from say , mexico , when applying to eu jobs . 
  which to those who do n't know , is around the level of `` subhuman '' . 
  good luck with your job placement !, 
  if i get the munich job i 'll buy you a beer if you pass through the city !,
