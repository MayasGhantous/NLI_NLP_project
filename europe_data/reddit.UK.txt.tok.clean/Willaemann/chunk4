  i already said that ; i 'm in favour of the eu but acknowledge a lot of british people hate freedom of movement with a passion . 
  being from devon i share blood with few of them . 
  all issues could be put to bed if the uk you know , acted like it wanted to be in the eu rather than being the one at the table with his eyes on every available exit . 
  i highly doubt that would change , though . 
  britain is a liberalist country ; `` live to work '' as it were , not `` work to live '' . 
  the eu is corporatist by and large , `` work to live '' . 
  the corporatist ideology is one of working with government regulations , employers and trade unions to make up a state that is the best for everyone . 
  liberalism is like the united states , `` i 'm alright jack '' , and more focused on the interests of corporations than of the people working within them . 
  the uk could , if it were not in the eu , scrap this directive , and let the market decide how many hours people should be working and what leave they are entitled to , * like how thatcher wanted * . 
  what if the market decides that it wants 70 hour weeks and zero leave ? 
  what can the workers do ? 
  * go to some other country without a visa and start working there ? 
  that was voted away . 
  a liberalist government , which the conservative , and any other thatcherite parties are , will seek to remove these regulations as soon as they can , in order to make it `` fairer '' for businesses . 
  its what their corporate interests want them to do ; deregulate the labour market . 
  finally , i never voted for a conservative party , neither did 65 % of the electorate , and yet here we are . 
  the tories push through things that have * no * popular support , so why would this be any different ? 
  one can hope . 
  i 'm not saying anything either way at this point . 
  i 'm assuming then that you were not like me . 
  when i was younger , my mother , a senior manager in a supermarket , was forced to work 70 hour weeks , and would get 2 weeks holiday a year * maximum * , which she would be coerced into not taking . 
  the company , who shall remain nameless , said that if she was n't willing to work these hours , then she 's `` uncommitted to the firm and will have to be looked upon accordingly '' i.e. 
  passed up for promotion , and risking her job . 
  the eu working time directive means she now works 40 hours a week , and has 4 weeks holiday a year . 
  it was implemented about 6 months before the wtd came into force that she would not have to work more than 40 hours , and was doubled with her holiday leave which she was required to take off ( no renumeration ) . 
  i would much rather have my mother , than more shareholder profits . 
  i do n't trust our neo-liberal governments with this at all . 
  the fact thatcher openly tried to stop this in case it hurt the profitability of firms , with * zero * regard for the people who were made to be wage slaves , confirms this . 
  my mistake . 
  [ the other two however , were very strongly opposed by thatcher ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catid=706&amp;langid=en&amp;intpageid=205 ) . 
  [ not many left to go ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02388/britain_2388153b.jpg ), 
  the express for a start . 
  do n't even go into the comments section of the independent , guardian , sun , daily mail , telepgraph , bbc , etc. 
  ukip must have a very strong social media team . 
  hopefully . 
  but its the freedom to live and work elsewhere without the trouble of a visa process that appeals to me . 
  i just applied to a job in munich . 
  there is no way in a month of sundays that freedom of movement for british people will survive if the uk leaves the eu . 
  its the single thing the `` british electorate '' , or at least a very vocal portion of it , would want to see gone first . 
  by many people yes . 
  in some newspapers he 's praised like its the second coming of christ . 
  now i 'm in favour of the eu , but i know someone that hates it for this . 
  he 's one of my best friends , and a hardline ukiper . 
  the blunt answer is : because those laws are decided in brussels , which is in belgium and not in london . 
  they feel like it 's foreign influence trying to destroy their `` british values '' and make this country nothing more like a puppet state for somebody else , whilst a proud nation like britain should be ruled by itself and itself alone . 
  this country once ruled the largest empire the world has ever seen , now it 's being told by * belgium * how to run itself , and the * french * and * germans * are allowed to have a say . 
  it is literally about where it is decided and who decides it . 
  they 're not british and it was n't in britain so how can these * foreigners * tell british people how to live ? 
  personally , as someone who has extensively studied business practices ; i am quite happy having the corporatist attitudes of the eu , which looks out for the interests of employees , having an interest over what would otherwise be neo-liberal london . 
  things like `` maximum working hours '' , `` holiday entitlements '' and '' ~ ~ minimum wages ~ ~ '' come from the eu ; despite thatcher 's attempts to block them . 
  we also go there to solve our issues with you guys , mon ami . 
  belgium has become a proving ground for europe ; a fitting place for the eu and nato to be based . 
  `` tackle '' referring to `` remove '' the ukip lot would n't accept anything less from him , and he 's just plain not going to get it . 
  it 's not in the interests of every other state to remove it just to satisfy potential ukip voters , and many would sooner see the uk leave than lose that right . 
  i quite like the fact i can go work in any one of 27 other states , or switzerland , or norway , or liechtenstein ; with little to no governmental formalities . 
  i also like that we can bring in labour from abroad . 
  i also like not having to pay for a visa to go visit my family in france , or friends in germany , and have full use of the healthcare system whenever i injure myself , regardless of where i am in the eu ( looking at you , austrian ski resorts and italian highways ) . 
  ** but ** i accept that a lot of my countrymen do not like immigration , or whenever directives come from brussels instead of london . 
  i hope that these issues can be put to bed and the uk can actually become a major player in the eu , rather than acting like it was dragged in and is looking for the escape hatch at every opportunity . 
  indeed . 
  on a slightly related note , the best british insult for belgium i have heard was on top gear . 
  `` it seemed we had a disagreement with our german counterparts , and so we did as our forefathers have done for generations , and went to belgium to sort it out . '', 
  it is indeed , it 's nice to see other ep members giving back [ what they regularly get at the hands of mr farage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5juavmxqrs ) . 
  maybe it is `` descending to his level '' , and its certainly unprofessional , but it is certainly amusing to see . 
  the thing is , this happens * every week * in the british parliament . 
  [ for example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1il2jgzizw ) . 
  he would get much worse at home than the ep gives . 
  guy verhofstadt is the only one who ever really does it back to him in the ep . 
  another point is that switzerland has in the past maintained its vast wealth by maintaining complete neutrality to the world 's problems , and having a rather open minded interpretation of banking laws ( although that one is of course beginning to change now ) , in addition to their high quality products . 
  i do n't see the uk being the sort of country to do the former . 
  i 'm pretty sure the current government would be happy to usurp the `` no name , just a number '' banking system that switzerland once dominated , however . 
  and yet , that is basically what a lot of them want . 
  `` the eu with no directives or immigration '' would be perfect to many of them , so essentially zero import/export taxes , and not having to pay for a visa to continue their annual holidays to france , but nothing else . 
  do n't forget that newspaper comments seem to be filled with ( probably paid ) political lobbyists . 
  like how every newspaper seemed to have someone claiming the end was nigh and the only way to prevent the coming apocalypse was to vote ukip , normally followed by `` ed miliband is weird '' , or whatever . 
  edit : spelling, 
  for a social experiment , we used to see what was the most bullshit we could get away with in newspaper comments sections and still be in the positive . 
  you can often go `` katie hopkins '' and still have the majority of support . 
  shows the difference in demographics between reddit and newspaper comments sections . 
  what 's interesting is he 's doing that to the guards of the houses of parliament ; i.e. 
  our centre of government ; they 're pissed off by it because it 's annoying when they 're trying to do their job , but most police are alright here . 
  those guys just get pissed off with tourists and idiots every day . 
  like when you 're on a night out and are a bit drunk , the police will get you some water and help you get in a taxi ; they 'll even make sure you get home okay if you 're * really * drunk but not causing any problems . 
  i 've pointed a nerf gun at a passing policeman in the park on parade day , he just joked that if i fired , he would have to call armed response to fire back . 
  british police are honestly pretty cool . 
   but it might still be used in more severe cases . 
  meanwhile in britain , [ this was on national television ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz001ktygmu ) . 
   insulting the king , their spouse or their heir gosh , so many people in the uk would be in prison if we had this law and it was enforced . 
   insulting a head of state or ambassador of a friendly foreign state i see at least one comment every day on a newspaper calling angela merkel `` literally hitler '' here . 
   publicly displaying indecent pictures or objects is amsterdam not included in this ? 
  i saw plenty of things that would be classed as `` indecent objects '' in the windows of shops in the red light district ; or is the definition of `` indecent '' quite a liberal one ? 
  indeed . 
  i know because switzerland is one of the main countries i have looked at going to for work . 
  people think that being out of the eu will make this country just like switzerland , but they forget that switzerland has immigration too ... 
  which is why i find it hard to believe that the uk would be even in the efta . 
  a vast number of the `` out '' people want it so for the primary reason that they do n't like immigration , it seems . 
  indeed , / u/trucidator is one of , if not * the * most reasonable anti-eu brit to be found here . 
  i 'm also interested to hear the anti-eu opinion on this . 
  aljazeera , russia today , bild , daily mail , the sun , fox news , etc ; so many options to choose from !, 
  what flavour would you like your bigotry to be today ?
