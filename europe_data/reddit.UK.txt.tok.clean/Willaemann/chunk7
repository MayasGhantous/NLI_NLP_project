  let us know if you survive . 
  want some tea old chap ? 
  i 'll trade you some for a waffle and a beer . 
  :( * oh fuck , i 'm british and have a photo of me wearing a marini\u00e8re , and another with a scarf and beret . 
  i 'm more french than you ? 
  i 'm a traitor . 
  oh i was n't talking about those ; i was talking about jobs within the ep , ec , and other eu public institutions `` eu jobs '' as in `` jobs within the eu institution '' than `` jobs within the eu nations '' . 
  my bad . 
  i do n't think they 'd want people who were not from member states advising on eu policy . 
  i imagine everyone already in the other eu nations aside from these would be safe . 
  be stupid to fire them . 
  it will likely be harder for any new people who want to go to germany though , for the same reasons as its hard for an mexican for example to get a job here presently . 
  oh it 's you , / u/tdcem , i figured you would be aware of the lib dems doing this , but here 's a fully sourced list for you . 
  [ page 33 of the lib dem manifesto 2010 reads `` we will scrap unfair university tuition fees so everyone has the chance to get a degree , regardless of their parents ' income . 
  '' ] ( http://www.libdemvoice.org/tuition-fees-how-liberal-democrat-mps-voted-22346.html ) [ here 's a guardian article from the time where clegg encouraged his mps to back fee rises . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/dec/07/tuition-fees-nick-clegg-lib-dems ) [ here 's a bbc article where they tried to apologise recently . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19646731 ) [ here 's an independent article suggesting clegg was in favour of fee rises . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nick-clegg-was-actually-keen-to-treble-tuition-fees-former-coalition-colleague-reveals-10218326.html ) [ here 's a record of who voted for , and who voted against , braking their election pledge . 
  ] ( http://www.libdemvoice.org/tuition-fees-how-liberal-democrat-mps-voted-22346.html ) if you have access to nexis : coates , s. , watson , w. * clegg leads ministers in vote for tuition fee rise . 
  * the times ( london , england ) , dec 4 , 2010 , p. 6 on p13 of the same edition ; '' * clegg leads ministers to vote for tuition fee rise as deal fails . 
  * '' so , please tell me how the lib dems breaking a pledge that is clearly in their manifesto , is not a prime example of another party breaking a pledge that is in their manifesto ? 
  you 're always so fast to be sarky and act like i am a child whenever i post anything , so please , would you like to show how it is n't ? 
  edit : throwing in a reference to the daily mail and ukip . 
  to make sure you can maintain your confirmation bias of me . 
  oddly enough i think ukip are pretty well laid-out in their plans , even if i disagree with them on an ideological level . 
  getting your manifesto independently audited before an election is a bold move ; kudos . 
  if it was n't / u/slyratchet it was me . 
  interesting ; i 'm a business graduate myself . 
  what was the book 's title ? 
  i 've read all kinds of things from all ends of the political spectrum and from different periods of history ; would make a nice addition . 
  you 're very welcome . 
  i find you to be the most interesting eusceptic to talk to , aside from someone i know personally ; like i say you source your materials well and can present a strong argument . 
  may have made me change a few of my own views ... whilst i know they are far from the full picture , i was advising them of asking ukip members since ukip are the most prominent anti-eu people in the uk ; no harm in speaking to them . 
  granted you 'll also find sceptics in the tory , labour , lib dem and green parties ( green have said they want an eu referendum , interestingly enough ) , but the most prominent are ukip . 
  i think we have agreed to disagree on just about everything . 
  you can see his legal background there ; certainly one who does his research before posting his views , and has what i would consider to be valid reasons for his views , even if i do n't agree with them . 
  / r/ukip was already a parody before they got to it ; so they went elsewhere . 
  there 's a few of them here . 
  / u/trucidator is pretty good anti-eu person to talk to about this as he always has sources , even if i do n't agree with his opinions . 
  / r/ukipparty is the ukip subreddit , i 'm sure if you wanted it from the horse 's mouth they 'd be happy to oblige . 
   en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-saxon_mode [ fixed ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-saxon_model ), 
  whilst ukip would be only too happy to push us out of eu jobs ; i would n't go back if i were in brussels or strasbourg . 
  also , america would have unblocked access to the uk then ... 
  oh i agree with you ; just trying to convey that i ca n't think of a single party that have kept to their election pledges entirely . 
  but they broke their key maifesto pledge at the first chance , and have been trying to say that it was n't their choice to , despite evidence to the contrary . 
  and this is one of the things that puts people off leaving . 
  we have enough american influence in our lives as it is . 
  they 'll have one to silence farage once and for all , if nothing else . 
  he 's become a real thorn in their side , dragging pretty much every party to the right . 
  have you forgotten the lib dems ? 
  because the eu elections are treated with apathy by pretty much everyone aside from those who have a deep , burning hatred of it . 
  36 % turnout last year or something along those lines . 
  care to give reasons beyond this ? 
  if every country that was found to be spying on its allies was thrown out , britain would have been gone * long * ago . 
  i never said we were wiser . 
  i said we were stepping back . 
  we 're more focused internally nowadays ; not that interested in what goes on outside , whilst in the past we were the ones who went out . 
  i 'll just take one of the hot women , in reparation for the women they stole . 
  can you imagine farage ? 
  he and rupert murdoch would work together to drag the uk out asap if it did . 
  i 'd love us to be one country , but there 's too many right wingers with their `` muh sovereignty '' in the uk for it to be possible at present . 
  we 're more like your parents than sibling . 
  we 're getting older , stepping back a bit , etc. 
  so if the unity which has led to peace is not good for europe , would competition that would likely lead to another war be better ? 
  as someone who is pro-eu i agree . 
  it 's the only way to shut farage up . 
  i highly approve of your username . 
  it would be so much better if we could just boot ukip out of the eu , rather than let them try to drag the whole country out kicking and screaming . 
  it was seen as the only option to some of the students i know . 
  they 're being silly and refusing to vote lib dem on principle , and the nus is paying for a campaign against lib dems . 
  * slow jazz hands *, 
  like the republicans do in the us ; `` do you want a man who speaks ** foreign ** running the country ? '', 
  well actually , yes . 
  gon na need some sources on that one . 
  the type of person we can all get along with . 
  * prost *, 
  neo-nazis do stuff like this , whilst over in germany an ss guard who actually worked in a concentration camp on the nazi 's side , pleaded guilty in a trial because they believe the world needs to know of the evil that happened in those places ? 
  the world is fucked up . 
  wait , oettinger makes the cut , but weihenstefaner does n't ? 
  in the same breath : fuller 's makes it , but not doom bar or tribute ? 
  i have a german wife * ftfy, 
  if they meet the standards i would n't mind . 
  i 'm not sure their massive , powerful neighbor would be so happy about it though . 
  it changes daily . 
  by and large people here are pro-eu . 
  i expect if you go to / r/ukip or whatever their actual subreddit is , they 're quite complacent when it shows exit results but angry when it does n't . 
  people tend to be complacent when it shows what they want it to . 
  besides that it 's a sample survey and not a full census ; there are many people unaccounted for . 
  ukip are a very loud , very vocal minority with the most outspoken leader in years . 
  but they 're polling at 15 % ish . 
  then there 's the silent majority . 
  when it comes down to it would they go with the devil they know , or the devil they do n't ? 
  nobody actually knows . 
  the guardian also posted today that ukip will get 4 seats maximum . 
  polls can be made to say whatever you want them to say . 
  nothing of the sort , my good man . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ god , ^ ^ ^ ^ help ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ move ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ stuff ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ship . 
  i do n't get why not . 
  we 're european , we 're in the eu , what more do we need ? 
  keep quiet , man .
