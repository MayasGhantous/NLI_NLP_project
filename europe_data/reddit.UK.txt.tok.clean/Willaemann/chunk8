  with them focusing on turkey , we can make a swift exit in the chaos . 
  oh they go much further . 
  these are just some of the ones which are safe for print . 
  he once told people not to stay in china too long , lest they get `` slitty eyes '' . 
  [ this should explain it ] ( http://www.bromford.co.uk/customer/changes-to-benefits/bedroom-tax/ ) . 
  it was basically a way for the conservative government to shaft people who live in council houses for the purposes of deficit reduction . 
  labour , greens and ukip have said they will abolish it . 
  lib dems want to change it so people who have nowhere else to go are n't forced to pay it . 
  that is n't out of the ordinary if you live in the far south . 
  is the nickname for munich still `` the village of 1 million people '' ? 
  the british royals are great for marketing the country . 
  they basically pay for themselves . 
  brits will often joke about them , but will be patriotic if people from another country insult them . 
  common themes for jokes : - their german ancestry ( bloody germans , coming over here , ruling our country . 
  send them back ! ), 
  - buckingham palace ( will the queen 's council house be hit with the bedroom tax ? ), 
  - the queen 's longevity ( and prince charles ' desire to be king asap ) - prince phillip , duke of edinburgh and [ racist granddad of a nation ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-philip-quotes-relive-65-1445185 ) . 
  it 's not surprising because you know , gibraltar benefits from the eu quite a lot . 
  it 's a tiny city just off spain . 
  why should they be forced out of the eu ? 
  because a little englander running for election in kent does n't want them to be part of it ? 
  or is that `` different '' ? 
  yeah they 're quite well known for being xenophobic toward anyone who is n't white , british , heterosexual and christian . 
  they can be quite sketchy with facts as well some times . 
  rip indeed . 
  it 's daily mail article ; a lot of people will downvote it by default . 
  sad story though . 
  same as my experiences then . 
  i witness a lot of casual racism from friends and coworkers ; thankfully aside from accidentally walking in on a britain first rally i 've never seen any active racism here . 
  when we had a terrorism alert ( i work in a government building ; they thought there was a bomb in the lobby ) , someone muttered `` well if the roof comes down angel ( black girl on the next team over ) can swing from the rafters and get us all to safety . '', 
  a common name for a convenience store is `` p * ki shop '' `` hitler had a point when it comes to gypsies and pikeys '' whilst passing a traveller site . 
  and of course , the answer to `` why would anyone * do * that ? '', 
  whenever an atrocity has been committed ; `` probably * foreign . 
  i think so !, 
  [ this one ] ( http://mafiagame.wikia.com/wiki/celeste_marque_500 ) appears to be it !, 
  to be fair to adolf , [ those cars were * nice * . 
  agreed . 
  i was conflicted when south africa recently removed the statue of [ cecil rhodes . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cecil_rhodes ) on the one hand the man represented everything wrong with imperialism and it is no shame to see idols of him being taken down . 
  on the other hand , it 's a reminder of the brutality of the past and how the country has progressed . 
  not wanting a debate on the matter , just giving an example . 
  [ the bbc had a go at an article on it ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-32248605 ) . 
  the soviet union sent it less than a year before they collapsed . 
  for the rest of my granddad 's life they never even recognised the help he and many others gave them . 
  without those fleets they could n't have survived germany 's onslaught . 
  he reminds me of [ marcus prinz von anhalt . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marcus_prinz_von_anhalt ) may the gods have mercy on europe if that man is ever allowed near power . 
  interesting . 
  thanks !, 
  says the guy from schwaben ... 
  i 've heard stories of the fraternities at t\u00fcbingen ... 
  [ it 's on the bbc now . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32251699 ) so , farage to say that it 's imperative the uk leaves the echr and dave to use this for some posturing whilst ed tries to dodge the subject ? 
  really ? 
  i do n't know what the opinion stands at now . 
  i expected it to be `` less ties with either '' followed by `` more with us ( and rest of anglosphere ) , less with eu '', 
  the distance ? 
  it 's 50 miles , ish , between dover and calais , complete with a rail tunnel . 
  that 's compared to 3260 miles from land 's end to new york city . 
  those letters they 've `` received '' pretty much sum up every negative stereotype about the us . 
  i 've met a lot of americans and only one has been like this . 
  i 've travelled in the us ( albeit not in the south , texas or the bible belt ) and everyone seemed pretty nice . 
  in that list you 've got military-based threats , references to the war of independence , `` socialist '' being used as an insult , and `` you 'd all be speaking german if it was n't for us '' they really did get the full range of negative american stereotypes in there . 
  if that 's how they * genuinely * reacted ; as a brit i urge you all to vote for sarah palin !, 
  my grandfather served on those convoys , across the pacific and the baltic as a medic . 
  this service was finally recognised by the ussr in 1991 . 
  the medal came about a week after he died . 
  is it that time of the week again ? 
  can we please just start putting them through to voicemail ? 
  just checked . 
  nothing on the guardian , daily mail or independent . 
  maybe this will go unnoticed ... 
  true . 
  i think the right wing press will try to use it as an anti-eu jab , but we see so many of those it 'll likely go unnoticed . 
  i dont know if it 'll make it into a bbc article at the moment , too much election stuff going on , and jeremy clarkson might step out of his front door , which will warrant most of the bbc 's news crews . 
  agreed . 
  dave will say he will fight it , nigel will say `` the eu is stopping us from our right to spy !, 
  the only solution to keep the country safe is to scrap the echr and leave the eu ... '' etc. 
  not to mention i think for the most part , we just do n't care about anything that does n't concern us personally . 
  live and let live . 
  lived with a romanian in germany . 
  yep , she thought `` i want everyone to be happy but that 's just unnatural and against god . '', 
  pity really , was otherwise one of the nicest people you could meet . 
  resolved to telling her that she was standing next to my `` best friend '' . 
  also since the uk is n't a member of the schengen zone , they have to get in first . 
  pretty good . 
  they 're allowed to marry ( including in selected churches if the pastor allows it ) in england , wales , and scotland . 
  civil partnerships in n. ireland . 
  they can adopt children no problem , and the traditionally `` gay '' areas of the country ; soho in london , brighton , and parts of manchester ; are well known for their parties . 
  my uncle is gay , my 91 year old grandmother and 95 year old grandfather have never had issue with it . 
  i 'm bisexual ; when i dated a guy my folks were just happy i had someone i like , and my family is catholic . 
  obviously would n't hold a guys hand in the rough parts of town or in the rural areas , but i expect thats the same everywhere . 
  lived in schwaben , can confirm . 
  i liked al murray 's stance on it . 
  `` a vote for labour is a vote for the snp is a vote for the conservatives is a vote for ukip is a vote for labour is a vote for the greens is a vote for the snp is a vote for lib dems and we all end up with plaid cymru . '', 
  or something like that . 
  it 's a load of horse shit . 
  its why the fptp system needs to go . 
  so we can get rid of this tactical voting rubbish and vote for who we actually believe in , or make it clear we do n't really believe in any of them . 
  of course its in neither the conservatives nor labours interest to change this , so i doubt it will .
