  i 've actually met a few naturally-blond haired , blue eyed spaniards . 
  correct . 
  it 's in an industrial estate . 
  very unassuming building . 
  not where you would expect . 
  guess they 're worried about people protesting outside , and it 's cheaper . 
  rise in the popularity of xenophobic groups can be observed through such metrics as facebook followers . 
  social media is one big data mine . 
  if more and more people are following these things , then more and more people are being exposed to it , starting to agree with it , whatever . 
  it 's half past midnight , i was at work yesterday , and came home to wine ; do n't expect fully harvard referenced responses . 
   painting the uk as a xenophobic hellhole where everybody worships farage is guaranteed to get you upvotes on / r/europe [ 1 ] . 
  he 's the master at it . 
  now call me an idiot , but that sounds * very * much like someone calling another 's loyalties into question . 
  who said that was all i enjoy ? 
  those are just particularly british things i enjoy or am proud of . 
  i prefer gaming , my guitar , rock music , rugby , winter sports , travel , and spending entire sundays in the pub . 
  those things are n't uniquely british though , unless you count [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_theft_auto_v ) british product that has taken far too much of my evenings . 
  what about a [ facebook page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/pegida.uk ) showing the number of people who `` like '' it . 
  [ or these wonderful people . 
  ] ( https://www.facebook.com/britainfirstgb?fref=ts ) please tell me that those organisations are not xenophobic or racist in any way , nor are they on the rise . 
  i do n't know why i 'm indulging you . 
  it 's quite clear that no matter what i say , you will disregard it , then go to other comments in the thread to spread some bullshit about me . 
  i feel proud to have made such a profound impact upon you . 
  not bad for a guy who 's drank a * lot * of wine tonight . 
  they had little ceramic ones of a band in this shop . 
  they were # 2.50 each . 
  i was tempted to get them for a friend who i have a little game running with regarding `` most offensive gesture possible '' ; i might go back and get them when its not a bank holiday monday and the shop doesnt have other customers in it , or when i can get away with taking a picture without the store owner seeing . 
  you are too kind . 
  actually i quite enjoy this country . 
  - the pub culture can not be beaten by any other , though some do make a good runner up . 
  - i challenge you to find somewhere more beautiful than devon , cornwall or sussex on a sunny day . 
  - nowhere else can do a breakfast to match . 
  - the ale is better than about 90 % of things i 've ever drank ( i advise [ admiral 's ale ] ( http://www.staustellbrewery.co.uk/admiral%27s-ale ) if you 're an appreciator . 
  we even have a good set of teams !, 
  - the internet . 
  - david attenborough . 
  - [ the rest of this list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_british_inventions_and_discoveries ) - london . 
  the books and the tv show . 
  all adaptions . 
  - harry potter - the magna carta - edit : missed the sense of humour . 
  even when we 're bad at things ( football , for example ) , we still have a good time and can make a joke of it . 
  no other country has quite grasped the idea of laughing at itself so well . 
  this list goes on . 
  i am rather proud of britain and what it means to be british . 
  just sad at what is happening to her . 
  i saw those on sale in a shop in widdecombe-in-the-moor recently . 
  i should have got a photo for that guy who 's going through every comment i make on this thread demanding hard evidence . 
  you really are out to scrutinise my entire comment thread ? 
  ok . [ take ] ( http://oneworld.org/2013/09/06/immigrants-to-uk-facing-rise-in-hostility-and-discrimination/ ) [ your ] ( http://www.salon.com/2013/01/03/british_xenophobia_on_the_rise/ ) [ pick ] ( http://www.investmentandbusinessnews.co.uk/politics/uk-immigration-and-a-nasty-dose-of-xenophobia/5101 ) and , obligatory article from [ the daily mail ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2151056/is-britain-racist-nation-one-brits-admits-racist-according-poll.html ) . 
  granted , yes , this one is older , from 2012 , but when even * they * can see it ... 
  why not anecdotal ? 
  i 've been treated in a disgusting manner by patrons in the pub more than once for speaking in german amongst my friends . 
  [ but since you 're out to scrutinise everything i say , here you go . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/11/polish-people-rise-in-attacks-blame-recession-politicians-media ) [ even the daily mail admits there has been a rise in hate crimes . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3026015/attacks-muslims-specific-hate-crime-say-tories-bid-establish-extent-islamophobia-britain.html ), 
  and yet germany , the country that * invented * beer , does not get as many problems as the uk does with alcohol . 
  couple the rising xenophobia in this country , with this country 's obsession of getting as hammered as physically possible on a friday or saturday night , and its going to end badly . 
  i live within a half hour of [ newton abbot ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newton_abbot ) . 
  home of [ trago mills ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trago_mills ) ( like a jumble sale in an aircraft hanger , shaped to look like schloss neuschwanstein and run by a very aggressively pro-ukip bloke ) , one of ukip 's founding members , and [ ukip itself ] ( http://www.ukip.org/contact ) . 
  i 'm surprised farage himself is n't running for election here . 
  depends on where you are . 
  in rural devon , farage can do no wrong , and is `` saying the things people never risked saying '' whilst everyone against him is a `` communist '' or `` hates britain '' . 
  now he 's saying all that racist bs , all of that 1950s xenophobia is pouring out in the hamlets , because if someone on the tv does it , it 's fine . 
  i 've recently heard words that i have n't heard since living next to the old lady from rhodesia , if that gives you an idea . 
  alcohol too , ironically enough . 
  what browser do you use ? 
  it installed pretty easy on chrome i found . 
  check you 've given it all the permissions it needs . 
  i do n't think it needs any additional plugins but i might be wrong . 
  [ `` we would n't want to be like the swiss , would we ? 
  that would be awful !, 
  we 'd be rich !, 
  '' ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/23/ukip-nigel-farage-david-cameron-eu-referendum-speech ) he regularly uses this excuse , forgetting switzerland has freedom of movement ; something he despises with a passion . 
  and yet they still have freedom of movement . 
  so the uk would never take that . 
  the uk would never take that sort of agreement . 
  mainly because they could n't say `` no immigration '' . 
  the glorious south . 
  i 'm in devon and farage looks as left wing as that green woman compared to some of the folks around here . 
  maybe that is the case in york . 
  however elsewhere in the country disliking foreigners because they are foreign has become * much * more socially acceptable since the rise of farage . 
  i would n't be surprised if we saw more of this in the future . 
  of course it was in britain that something like this happened . 
  binge drinking , the uk nightlife culture , and rising xenophobia combined . 
  great way to present the country to the rest of the world . 
  to be fair , since farage has appeared , disliking people for being foreign has become much more socially acceptable . 
  this is just the first physical manifestation of that we 've seen . 
  nobody really cares . 
  even vast swathes of the believers are non-practising . 
  if i had n't had a hold bag ( bringing over various british things to an anglophile friend ) i could have done it in 15 minutes flat . 
  bloody baggage handlers letting down the side as per usual . 
  11m30s in gatwick ? 
  what time was that arrival ? 
  the kaiser 's [ mother ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victoria,_princess_royal ) and [ grandmother ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_victoria ) were both british , and both died in the same year . 
  what happened to his desire to see england and scotland totally separate ? 
  with american bombing accuracy , they could wipe out milton keynes whilst aiming for parliament . 
  on that note ; hey ` murica !, 
  we have oil and we 're not sharing with you !, 
  i think my best view was on a ba flight from stuttgart to heathrow , we flew right across central london on a clear day . 
  i tend to read the newspaper , make phonecalls to everyone in a 20 mile vicinity to suggest beer ( regardless of time of day ) , or sleep on the journey into london afterwards .
