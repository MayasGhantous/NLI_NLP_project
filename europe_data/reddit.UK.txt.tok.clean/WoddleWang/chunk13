  more immigration means house prices rising meaning buying and paying off a house is more expensive . 
  you 're right , it is n't back of the napkin calculation , dipshit .

  the pound tanking and inflation rising is n't necessarily bad . 
  all growth predictions are forecasting growth , just not high growth . 
  [ that 's hardly catastrophic . 
  ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/catastrophic ), 
  where did i say immigration would drive up the cost of living ? 
  are you honestly this stupid ? 
  - green belt = cost of land rises - 70 % of the cost of building a house is the buying of land - more people = more demand for housing - more demand for housing = more demand for land - house prices rise https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_belt_ ( united_kingdom ) what the fuck do you think would happen ? 
  more people would arrive and suddenly land is * cheaper * ? 
  * you 're * wrong on this , and it 's not racism you annoying social justice warrior imbecile . 
  you do n't have to be racist to want less immigration . 
  [ do you even know the definition of racism ? 
  ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/racism ) you do n't need to think that our race is superior to want less immigration . 
  i did n't give an argument that population increases are bad , i gave an argument that population increasing too fast * in * * the * * uk * is bad because it drives up house prices since we ca n't build more housing cheaply enough because of the green belt policy keeping the price of land high . 
  it 's true that migrants drive up gdp , but no shit . 
  more people = more gdp is just a fact . 
   wow , people like you who believe in `` overpopulation '' still exist . 
  well , i do n't think overpopulation is happening right now , i think that eventually there will be too many people . 
  i do n't think we should kill people or anything , but maybe encouraging people to have less babies or something more subtle . 
  no laws or anything . 
  more people is n't gon na be great for the environment . 
  now stop being such a pedantic asshat and accept you 're wrong and that there are economic arguments against immigration you pathetic little shit . 
  once i gave that argument you immediately switched to `` would you also be in favor of a one child policy ? '', 
  instead of actually targeting what i said . 
  you think you 're smart but you 're an imbecile . 
  there 's nothing wrong with admitting that there is an economic argument against immigration . 
  if you disagree , target my fucking argument instead of spouting shit about overpopulation, 
  no , because that restricts the freedom of british citizens . 
  comparing wanting to limit immigration because of expensive housing to the one child policy is absolutely fucking * pathetic * . 
  i gave you an economic argument for wanting to limit immigration and you then you resort to that . 
  could n't just admit that there are reasons for wanting limited immigration without just being racist . 
  ... unless you were genuinely asking , which i hope you were even though i doubt it , in which case ... it depends on circumstances . 
  overpopulation does need to be avoided , though i 'm sure there are better ways of going about it than the one child policy . 
  we do n't insult other countries because of ignorance of the empire 's past , we do that because that 's just what british people do . 
  we insult our own country more than any other anyway . 
  ignorance of the empire 's atrocities is n't why people make jokes in bad taste , believe it or not . 
  they 'd still be made either way . 
  that said , it 's not like we go around taking the piss out of the holocaust . 
  i just happen to be british . 
  if you had said it about any other country , i would have said the exact same thing . 
  also , you never pointed it out , and even if you had , history is just one subject . 
  the british empire 's history being ignored in schools does n't mean that the british education system is shit . 
  [ education in the uk is n't as bad as you seem to think it is . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_index ) it could obviously be better , but it 's not * that * shit . 
  maybe you should educate your own dumb ass before talking about shit you know nothing about . 
  also , there are no studies that prove education correlates with how tasteful jokes are . 
  stop chatting shit . 
  yeah , i 'm not surprised , just annoyed at the number of comments saying the same thing . 
  i edited it to say that i 'd * want * to vote leave out of spite , not that i personally would actually do so . 
  made it more obvious that i 'm just making a point . 
  i was just making the point that insulting people because they have disagree with you is n't going to help . 
  i would n't actually vote purely out of spite . 
  i would n't actually vote leave just because i feel insulted . 
  i was making the point that insulting people for disagreeing with you will not bring them over to your side . 
  and `` quite possibly racist '' ? 
  you called me racist because you think i 'd vote leave purely out of spite ? 
  fuck me , you are an intellectual black hole . 
  stay away from normal people , we have enough idiots pottering about as it is . 
  i did n't vote leave and i 'm not racist , you idiot . 
  thanks for being a part of the problem though . 
  there 's nothing racist about wanting less immigration , it depends on the reason for wanting less , and i 'm pretty sure the majority of the people that voted leave are n't racist . 
  there 's no reason to think that they are . 
  i did n't vote leave purely because i * was * informed . 
  everyone else i know voted leave , but i never called them idiots because of it . 
  i explained that we 'd be slightly worse off economically , but not everything is about economics , so they voted leave anyway . 
   only do it out of spite not saying that i 'd vote * purely * out of spite . 
  my point is that insulting people because of their opinion is just going to alienate them . 
  remainers calling leave voters racists , bigots and idiots really did n't help their case . 
   more immigrants does mean more demand for housing yes . 
  it also means more workers in construction/more employment for construction workers which means more houses shih drives down prices . 
  yeah , not in the uk it does n't . 
  one of the main reasons house prices are so high is the green belt policy . 
  [ 70 % of the cost of building new houses is the purchase of the land . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_belt_ ( united_kingdom \\ ) ) more workers in construction is n't going to fix the issue of not having enough land available to lower the price of it , so it 's either less immigration or higher house prices . 
  we * could * get rid of the green belt policy , but i 'd rather preserve as much of our countryside as possible . 
  so there you go . 
  an economic argument that holds up . 
  you do n't need to be racist to want less immigration . 
  there are also cultural reasons for wanting less immigration , though that does n't really apply to europeans since they tend to integrate really well . 
  trump 's victory is neither here nor there . 
  nothing to be sad about until he 's actually had time to do stuff . 
  who knows what his presidency will be like . 
  hopefully his ego will drive him to actually make america greater so that he has a good legacy . 
  at least with him there 's that chance , under clinton it would have just been more of the same . 
  safe bet vs risky bet , and americans went with the risk ( or at least , the electors did ) . 
  i just hope he does a 180 on his climate change views . 
  [ the effects of immigration on social services ] ( https://fullfact.org/immigration/impacts-migration-local-public-services/ ) , are n't really that well understood as it turns out . 
  my mistake . 
  as for infrastructure , it ca n't be argued that more people in the uk = more people using the roads , trains etc. 
  while that 's not necessarily * bad * , more traffic and pollution is n't exactly good . 
  the main reason i can think of for limiting immigration is honestly housing , do n't know why i did n't mention it in the above comment ( edited in now , replaced social services/infrastructure ) . 
  there just are n't enough houses being built , house prices being driven up by more demand just means that young people are going to find it even harder to become home owners . 
  i did n't vote leave , we 're not in a recession and the economy is n't `` fucked '' , we 're just not going to grow as fast as we would have inside the eu . 
  it 's childish to do it purely out of spite , yes , but you ca n't blame the people in the middle for getting pushed over to the other side by people constantly slagging them off for having an opinion . 
  i did n't vote leave , just for the record . 
  how is it childish ? 
  if people were thinking about voting to leave and remainers are calling them ignorant idiots for their decision , do you really think they 're going to 180 and say `` you know what , you 're right '' and switch to the side with the people insulting them ? 
  it 's childish to do it * purely * out of spite , yes , but you ca n't blame the people in the middle for getting pushed over to the other side by people constantly slagging them off for having an opinion .
