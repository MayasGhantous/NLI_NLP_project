  it took an extra five years to build because construction kept being stalled due to lack of funds . 
  yeah , absolutely . 
  fuck wasting money on scrounging economic migrants . 
  defense is important . 
   this is a waste of money as it stands . 
  thank you for your input , ignorant armchair general . 
  inform yourself and then try again . 
   if they actually wanted this to be useful and actually practical etc. . then it would have catapults and an angled deck i love that you think you know what would be useful and practical better than than the professionals in the military behind this carrier . 
  they were designed so that catapults could be built in relatively easily anyway . 
   but as ever it was not done simply to cut costs expenses are pretty important . 
  cutting costs allowed us to have two carriers , which is much , * much * better than having a single catobar nuclear powered carrier . 
  nuclear power is pretty pointless too considering the carriers will always have a support fleet , which is something that was thought of when it was being designed . 
  nuclear is useful if you 're america . 
  if you 're france and can only afford one carrier , it 's a waste of money and means that you wo n't have a carrier permanently available because that one carrier needs to be maintained . 
  better to have two conventional carriers than a single nuclear one so that one is available while the other is being maintained/refitted/repaired . 
   would 've added so much more value to the carrier not really . 
  the f-35b is a fifth-generation fighter , it 's fine . 
   it 's profitable for the nation gdp increases do n't matter to normal people . 
  too much immigration causes many problems , mostly cultural but some economic . 
  cheap labor drags down wages for everyone . 
  not quite . 
  it 'd be 7th behind the uk , germany , the netherlands , ireland , belgium and france . 
  polish mind - not even paying attention hungarian mind - even less than a pole hungarian amusement - ** doing ** ** nothing ** this is one hilariously savage list, 
  you may have misunderstood this chart . 
  greece at 140 % in 2008 does n't mean its gdp was bigger than france 's at 120 % , it means that greece had grown 40 % since 2000 while france had only grown 20 % . 
  in absolute terms , france 's 20 % growth was probably like ten or something times greater than greece 's 40 % increase . 
   but italian millennials , we are kinda cool , we know our shit jesus . 
  you do realize every generation thinks they 're the one that 'll fix shit and change the world right ? 
  millennials are n't special . 
  as we grow older we 'll become more conservative just like every other fucking generation . 
  there 'll be change but overall it 'll be slow and gradual as always . 
  millennials are n't special enlightened snowflakes and all old people are n't useless pampered narcissistic old farts . 
   the british aircraft carriers are n't nuclear powered , which mean less payload capability for the ship , as they need big fuel tanks . 
  the carriers are far bigger so that does n't matter as much , and besides , carrier fleets are always accompanied by support craft . 
  we already four new huge fast fleet tankers , each comparable to the french aircraft carrier in displacement , on top of the rest of our replenishment fleet , so fuel is n't really an issue . 
  yeah i would n't really go off of global firepower . 
  they clearly do n't take into account the quality of the kit . 
  i mean , look how close they place russia to the us . 
  a country with 1 hunk of junk carrier is almost equal to a country with 11 nuclear powered supercarriers ? 
  what a fucking joke . 
  when you compare gdp , budgets and especially their respective navies and air forces it becomes a laughable comparison , it 's not even close to being close ( on paper ) . 
  yeah , they 're fine . 
  i never said that we 're overflowing with islamic immigrants , just that importing their culture is bad because it 's backwards as fuck . 
  that article just stated that wage growth has n't kept up with gdp growth . 
  does n't disprove anything . 
  the uk has some of the highest wages and paying jobs in europe and wage growth * has * been increasing . 
  wage growth not keeping pace with gdp growth does n't change that . 
  common law is better than civil law imo for the reasons already stated by / u/raspberry _ smoothie  we have a greater appreciation for the greyness of the human condition and generally believe judging unforseen cases on the word of the law is asking to convict people who do n't really deserve it , whereas at least in common new precedent can always be set . 
  also , imperial-metric mutant system for life . 
  not really , it 's just that as people get older they become more conservative . 
  the uk was doing pretty decently ever since it joined the eec yet the generation that voted us in grew up into the people that voted us out . 
  the generation of today are n't immune to the trends of the past , we are n't special . 
  as we get older our political position will change and the new generation will think that when they 're our age , the world will burst into a new golden-age as they introduce new socialist policies and stop the corruption , because they 're not like the old fools that are in power now . 
  it 's just the same old shite . 
  the likelihood of us ever rejoining the eu is low , i doubt we 'll ever rejoin . 
   or they turn against us and start working against us after seeing what happened with iraq , i 'd be surprised if they 're brave enough to start pulling that shit . 
  well , it 's debatable , nothing to `` chucke '' at . 
  it 's easy to make a case for either new york or london as the number one financial city in the world , no other cities really compare though . 
  getting scared ? 
  no , stating facts . 
  china does give a fuck , english is in high demand in china . 
  english is the lingua franca , deal with it . 
  turkey 's a * little * bit closer to europe than china is , and china 's been the way it is for a while . 
  turkey went full retard only recently with erdogan going full dictator and the turkish people voting away all of the progress they 've made . 
  do you really need it explained that more recent events closer to home will pop up more in discussion ? 
  are you really that fucking stupid ? 
   while china , a country that is worse in every way imaginable i 'd rather live in china than turkey . 
  at least china is stable and are n't threatening to allow a horde of refugees to wander into our territory . 
  ... why ? 
  because the eurozone ( which we were never a part of in the first place ) grew faster than the us for one quarter ? 
  do n't talk shit . 
  and when imbeciles get bored they produce meaningless comments like yours . 
  nobody mentioned london but okay . 
   yeah . 
  besides shell and british petroleum i do n't know any single british company . 
  exactly , which is why you know fuck all . 
  oh yeah , forgot about jcb , third largest construction equipment manufacturer . 
   just name a single british company that matters worldwide . 
  there are a few , in the military complex but that 's that and that 's it clearly you know absolutely fuck all . 
  - royal dutch shell - bp - unilever - rio tinto - glaxosmithkline - ineos - anglo american - bae - rolls royce - gkn and we produce almost as many cars as you . 
  you ca n't assume the uk has nothing just because you 're dumb and do n't know any better . 
  we focus on finance and services more than exporting products but our industrial sector still generates more gdp than yours . 
  thanks , i tried finding a more up to date list of manufacturers but could n't . 
  either way , it 's still in the top 10 , so my point still stands that the uk is not a shrimp industrially . 
  she 's a suspected terrorist , damn right she ca n't catch a break . 
  you export a fair bit more than us , but neither of our export numbers are bad . 
  we 're both in the top 10 . 
  france and the uk do n't export as much as germany , but we do n't need to because we 're not as trade-oriented . 
   the uk doesnt have much when it comes to industry . 
  [ the uk manufactures more than france at 6th in the world , but whatever ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/industry/manufacturing-output ) [ our industry also generates a higher gdp than yours at 7th in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_sector_composition ) we just do n't export as much of our industry as you do . 
  i know we 're not the workshop of the world anymore , but i do n't get why people think we do n't produce anything except for financial services , actors and movies/shows . 
   taking a lot more time and using a lot more energy it takes more time but it definitely does not take more energy to ship . 
  shipping is way more efficient . 
  it really is n't . 
  4.3 % is pretty much minimum unemployment . 
  2 % or lower would be unhealthy , and there are no nuts2 regions in germany or the uk below 2 % , so i think you 're just making shit up . 
  i do n't get my news from rt. 
  i looked for figures on refugee education and that was one of the sources that popped up . 
  did n't realize it was a shitty source . 
  more than the other fuckwit did , at least i looked for figures .
