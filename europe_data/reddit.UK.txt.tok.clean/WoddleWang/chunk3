  if anything it would just make an even bigger mess . 
  just like every other major civilization in human history . 
  just because people died does n't mean colonialism was objectively bad . 
  cry more , dumbass . 
  calm down asshole , he never said he was proud . 
  he was just saying that the spanish empire did n't lose their territories * that * fast . 
  does n't mean we or ireland will put border controls in place . 
  our secretary of state for exiting the eu said that we would n't seek a hard border . 
  it 's a pretty hard border to police anyway . 
  if the eu forces ireland to tighten the border with the uk , then that just makes me glad we left . 
  fuck an organization like that . 
  ... why would there be a border in ireland ? 
  that 's a separate agreement . 
  political terminology for the cold war , where nato and allies were first world , soviets and allies were second world and the rest of the world was third world . 
  it 's not for splitting countries into groups based on anything . 
  when did i ever say it had anything to do with economics ? 
   the term third world arose during the cold war to define countries that remained non-aligned with either nato , or the communist bloc . 
  the united states , canada , japan , south korea , western european nations and their allies represented the first world , while the soviet union , china , cuba , and their allies represented the second world . 
  by that definition , the uk is first world . 
  by the definition a lot of people use nowadays , where third world means poor country , the uk is still first world . 
  you ca n't just make up definitions like penki did . 
  instead of going full retard like vadrigar , just look at it the way the article wants you to . 
  dark blue - front-runners for integration blue - swing countries light blue - rebels, 
  uk = third world country ? 
   well you 'd be right because it wont , if anything we 'll start independence on a backward footing and have to take it from there yep , you 'd definitely start off in a bad position economically and would be worse off in the short term . 
  that much is certain and was my main point of contention with some other independence voters who thought that scotland would somehow plug the deficit immediately and raise living-standards while avoiding higher taxes and/or cutting spending . 
   staying in the uk economically speaking means that for the time being , while it is politically tenable ( and it 's already getting untenable ) our bills will be paid , but it is n't going to last forever . 
  absolutely . 
   independence may be uncertain and bring its economic risks with it but so too does staying in the uk , and at least as an independent country when we fuck up our economy we have to start fixing it rather than saying that that is our fate , to be economically destitute . 
  understandable , considering that the union let wales slip into a 25 % deficit , continued prosperity in the union is definitely not guaranteed , like you said . 
  honestly everything you said makes sense and is totally realistic , in the long/mid-term at least . 
  living standards would definitely fall post-independence and the economy would take a significant hit , but if you look past that initial shock , the future for an independent scotland might possibly be just as good if not better than if it remained inside of the uk , especially if you 're free of the tories and inside of the eu , though nothing is ever certain . 
  in the end it 's the will of the people that matters . 
  if the majority of scots want independence then they 'll get it , and i hope it goes well for you , though personally i 'd rather the uk stay whole , it 'd be weird living through the dissolution of the united kingdom . 
  i wonder if scottish independence would kick-start other movements , like catalonia . 
  i have my own opinion of course , i was just asking what your reasons are for leaving the uk . 
  the only people i dismiss as idiots are fucktards that deny facts and think scotland would be economically fine and that leaving the uk would be better in * every * * single * * way * . 
  though the economics are just one part of it . 
  there are good reasons for scotland wanted to leave the uk , i even listed two . 
  i was interested in hearing yours and wanted a reasonable discussion since so far it 's just been toxicity and stupidity on both sides . 
   a lot of people intending to vote yes ( me included ) can i ask why you want to vote for independence ? 
  genuinely curious , i want a reasonable scot 's viewpoint . 
  sick of the bravehearts . 
  i 've seen loads of scots try and argue that scotland would be economically better off , which is absolute nonsense . 
  i 'd explain why it 's economic suicide but i 'm assuming you already know why it would be since you seem informed , so i 'll only explain if asked . 
  the only genuinely good reasons i 've seen for independence are : - escaping the tories ( absolutely understandable ) - wanting to keep freedom of movement with the eu what are your reasons for wanting to leave the uk ? 
  damn , that was pretty savage , nice . 
   standard chartered plc and barclays plc are ** considering ** choosing ireland 's capital as their eu base for ensuring continued access to the bloc  the wall street firm is ** considering ** making frankfurt its main hub inside the eu and could move as many as 1,000 employees this is all the same stuff we 've already been hearing . 
  some banks are * considering * moving the minimum number of employees over to the eu keep their passporting . 
  thanks for linking an article from july 2016 . 
   all the people who 've just been employed will loose their job again . 
  so not many people at all then . 
  also , it 's lose , not loose . 
  what corps/banks/orgs ? 
  some businesses have said they * might * relocate , where are these banks saying that they will most likely move ? 
  would n't blame them , pretty sure most of the world would enjoy watching a dickhead like erdogan get what he deserves . 
  i hope that at least saudi arabia sides with turkey in the unlikely event of a war . 
  who would n't enjoy watching the world 's terrorist piggy bank get obliterated by the french ? 
  well , as bad as our politicians are , at least we do n't have erdogan . 
  i 'd say i feel sorry for turkey but they 're are so phenomenally fucking stupid that they keep voting for akp . 
  i can kind of understand trump , brexit and le pen ( le pen not so much ) , but why the turks keep voting for akp and why they 're supporting him now is absolutely beyond me . 
  they must really hate democracy and good government . 
  i 'd rather have fifty years of trump or may than one year of erdogan . 
  well , we * could * just turn them away . 
  we do n't have to accept the migrants . 
   you forgot that people of your country have n't seen real losses since 1945 . 
  any government that chooses to begin operation bringing more than thousand bodybags goes down on nearest elections . 
  or maybe even resigns under massive anti-war manifestations . 
  you do realize you 're talking about the uk , right ? 
  i seriously doubt that the british people would be opposed to a defensive war against turkey , because if it did come to war that 's the kind of war it 'd be . 
  europe would n't strike first unless turkey did something really fucking nasty . 
   same goes for sanctions . 
  if you try to sanction turkey shitstorm will be all over uk over those billions lost on sanctions backfiring and erdogan 's counter-sanctions . 
  haha turkey 's sanctions against the uk would n't do a fucking thing . 
  we 're one of the less trade-reliant nations , it makes up a relatively small amount of our gdp . 
  you think a few billion here or there will make a difference to the uk , let alone cause a shitstorm ? 
  our currency tanked from $ 1.50 to $ 1.25 and barely anything happened . 
  turkey ca n't do a thing , we do n't even really trade with them , but we invest in them . 
  we 're one of their top investors . 
  sanctioning russia did n't have a noticeable effect on us , why would turkey be any different ? 
  speaking of investors , the dutch are the biggest investors in turkey . 
  they 'd do well not to piss the tulip people off . 
  meanwhile turkey would be sanctioned by all of europe . 
  * that * would have an effect . 
   western countries lack inhumanity to actually do something real against muslims . 
  or anyone else . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falklands_war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_iraq tell me again about how the uk would n't do anything against muslims or anyone else . 
  as for france , you 're seriously underestimating the french people . 
  if you think they lack the will to do anything about a belligerent turkey being a pain in their ass , you 're in for a shock . 
  what the fuck does turkey think it can do ? 
  economically , turkey and the meast combined are midgets compared to europe . 
  politically , they have nothing on the european influence . 
  when it comes to allies , the uk has five eyes ( australia , canada , new zealand , us , uk ) and is best buds with the united states . 
  spain and portugal are friendly with most of latin america . 
  if it comes to blows , do they really think they 'd have a chance ? 
  uk crushes turkey , france crushes the rest of the middle east . 
  they 'd need a lot more than the islamic world to do anything against europe . 
   i think the fact that theresa may leads the uk without a mandate really is a pressing matter for uk democracy to be fair , that 's just how british democracy works . 
  you elect the party , not the person . 
  meltdown ?
