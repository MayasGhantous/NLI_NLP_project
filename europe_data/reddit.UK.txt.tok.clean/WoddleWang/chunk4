  i 'm literally telling you facts that i can back up while you 're pulling that 10 year old tactic of `` you do n't know what you 're talking about but i wo n't tell you what specifically you 're wrong about because i 'm actually wrong and refuse to admit it '' . 
  that 's pretty much a concession . 
  i literally linked you a bbc article quoting government figures which prove you wrong and stated the fact that new eu members who meet the requirements must join the euro , but i do n't know anything about the subject ? 
  what 's next ? 
  are you going to argue that the scottish growth figures are wrong too ? 
  or are you going to tell me that scotland will just magic away the deficit ? 
  seriously , * nothing * i have said can be debated because it 's not my opinion , it 's literal fact . 
  the only thing that you could even argue about is what scotland is going to do about the deficit once independent . 
  were you educated in a fucking pub ? 
  so you have nothing to say about the fact that the deficit figures came from the scottish government ? 
  so then you 're admitting that you fucked up and were wrong , because everything else i said is fact . 
  scotland has a 9.5 % public spending deficit , the figures were given by the scottish government and reported by the bbc . 
  * fact * . 
  joining the euro is mandatory for eu members that meet the requirements . 
  * fact * . 
  scotland is growing far more slowly than the rest of the uk . 
  * fact * . 
  scotland will have to slash spending or raise taxes to lower the deficit . 
  not necessarily a fact , but what else do you propose you do about that gaping 9.5 % deficit ? 
  oil wo n't help you now . 
  these are all facts , some of which i previously went through the effort of linking source to prove , unlike you who just went off your own dumb-fuck thoughts and assumed you were right . 
  so * you * stop embarrassing yourself , you imbecilic specimen . 
   again , scotland can not have a deficit while it 's part of the uk . 
  it is impossible and yet it has a public spending deficit of 9.5 % . 
  but please , tell me more about how you know better than the bbc and the fucking * scottish * * government * . 
  they 're the ones who provided the numbers for gods sake . 
  so yes , scotland would either have to go through severe austerity and massively cut public spending or raise taxes * significantly * to lower the huge deficit upon independence . 
  that nice situation would last for a long time since scotland is growing so slowly , and that 's while being supported by the rest of the uk . 
  sounds fantastic . 
   i 'm also smiling at the suggestion you believe scotland would operate its economy exactly the same as the uk currently does i never said it would ? 
  it would definitely be similar though . 
   your euro argument did make me laugh though . 
  you 've went from mandatory ... not meeting the requirements ( despite them already being in the eu ) to voluntarily it * is * mandatory , so long as you meet the requirements . 
  joining is not voluntary , sweden just plays the system . 
  i never said being in the euro is necessary to be in the eu , just that new eu members must join the euro once they meet the requirements . 
   no need to get upset or angry about it , i would n't expect you to have an understanding of the subject . 
  this coming from somebody who clearly has a very limited grasp of economics . 
  then again , you know more about the scottish economy than the actual scottish government so clearly you 've got some deep insider knowledge . 
  i was just being hypothetical , there 's pretty much no chance that the anglo countries , especially the us , will ever form a bloc like that , and there are certainly no plans to do anything like that . 
  nonsense ? 
  one second then . 
   it 's literally impossible for us to have a deficit . 
  [ scottish deficit ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-37167975 ) scotland spends more than it takes in with taxes . 
  that 's a fact . 
  the uk has a 4 % deficit . 
  _______________  no idea why you mention the euro . 
  it 's not been suggested we will join the euro . . and despite the myth you do n't have to use it all eu members which have joined the bloc since the signing of the maastricht treaty in 1992 are legally obliged to adopt the euro once they meet the criteria https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enlargement_of_the_eurozone _______________  unless you 're about to tell me the likes of bulgaria , croatia , czech republic , denmark , hungary , poland , romania and sweden have been using it in secret ? 
  they either do n't meet the requirements or , like sweden , maintain that joining erm ii is voluntary . 
  i seriously doubt they 'll allow a new eu member to play the system like that . 
  once you meet the requirements , you have to join . 
  besides , joining the euro would be something you 'd * want * to do , unless you think creating a brand new currency post-independence is a good idea . 
  you could always peg it to the pound , but then you would n't be able to have your own monetary policy . 
  _______________  no offence , but this is pretty basic stuff . 
  it 's not even worth debating if you do n't understand it . 
  i 'm being told this by an uneducated dipshit who does n't know what he 's talking about and thinks that scotland is just incapable of having a deficit because it 's not independent . 
  if you 're arguing that scotland wo n't be in a really shitty economic situation post-independence you 're a fucking lunatic . 
  well that 's why we would n't form a unit with the us and other anglo nations , but if we did , we 'd be the 2nd biggest component of the world 's most powerful and richest bloc . 
  does n't sound too bad . 
  you 're right , the uk definitely needs reforming . 
  we could scrap the barnett formula first off and put some of that money into the places that actually need it like wales and northern ireland . 
  maybe a federal uk would work , but there 's no political will to go for anything like that . 
  are you taking the piss ? 
  60 % of your trade is with the rest of the uk , compared to 15 % with the entire eu . 
  your public services are kept afloat by the barnett formula , you get # 2000 extra per head spent on you than we do in england . 
  you 're only growing at a rate of 0.2 % compared to the rest of the uk at 0.6 % . 
  all this and you have a 10 % budget deficit . 
  you would n't be allowed to use the euro with a deficit that large , and using the euro is mandatory for new eu members . 
  if you left you would have to use a new currency so your economy is straight away going to take a hit . 
  you wo n't get money from the uk anymore and would still have a huge deficit so you would either have to go into austerity and get rid of free university tuition and cut other services , or drastically raise taxes . 
  either way , people are going to be very unhappy , poorer and have lower living standards . 
  yes , scotland is financially dependent on the uk . 
  pretending otherwise is idiotic . 
  your living standards would fall by quite a bit after independence . 
  the economic argument for independence is very weak , it 's not even slightly comparable to the consequences of the uk leaving the eu . 
  and yet when the uk leaves the eu we ( the english ) get loads of shit . 
   scotland will have a market of 500 million to trade with , and have all that might behind them in trade negotiations . 
   have all that might behind them in trade negotiations they would n't have any `` weight '' behind them , they would n't be doing the negotiating . 
  it would be an eu-uk deal , not a scotland-uk deal . 
   brexit was just a complete fucking disaster calm the fuck down , nothing 's even happened yet . 
   the eu must remain , the eu must stay strong , it 's the world 's only hope at fighting climate change put the crack pipe down and stop being so dramatic . 
  the eu is not at all the world 's `` only hope '' in fighting climate change . 
  if the eu had 0 emissions climate change would still continue because of the us , china , india and other polluting nations . 
  scotland used to be a net contributor to the british exchequer , but recently , because of the oil crash , you 've become the opposite of that ( i 'm tired i could n't think of the word or whatever ) . 
  i know you were net contributors for a lot of the time but that 's just how it is right now because of the oil price crash and the scottish economy not doing too great . 
  right now you 're being subsidized by the rest of the uk so on top of the other issues independence would bring ( no stable currency , would n't be in the eu straight away , 60 % of trade is with the ruk , necessary budget cuts to deal with the huge 10 % deficit ) the * economic * argument for leaving is really weak . 
  i can totally understand wanting independence from the god damn motherfucking tories and dumbass theresa may though . 
  they 're absolute cunts , taking the referendum at face value and the `` brexit means brexit '' nonsense . 
  labor is in a shitty state too right now but they would n't be your problem after independence . 
   and assessed whether they would be going up or down post #sexit currently the rest of the uk is subsidizing scotland , they 're in a rough spot after the oil price crash . 
  scotland would have to cut services , their deficit would be too large . 
  it 's already above 10 % right now . 
  their costs would definitely be going up . 
  mix that with an unstable new currency since they would n't be able to adopt the euro straight away , and you get a fair bit of economic turmoil . 
  not saying that they should n't go for independence , but that 's just how it is right now . 
  for the record , i 'm not against independence , but pretending that scotland would be better off is fucking insane . 
  scotland needs england a * lot * more than we need them . 
  we subsidize them for fucks sake , if anything , they 're a parasite to * us * . 
   scotland would profit from remaining in the eu a lot more than by pretending they have n't been exploited by arrogant englishmen for centuries , and remaining in the uk . 
  scotland trades far more with the rest of the uk than with the eu . 
  if they really wanted to trade more with the eu , they 've had plenty of time to do it .
