   what i tried to tell you is that the only things america has achieved with its superpower was destroying said countries and then fighting the following upraise in terrorism all over the world you tried to say that and you were completely wrong , proving once again that you are an imbecile . 
  south korea 's entire existence is purely thanks to the us . 
  kuwait still exists thanks to us intervention . 
  you do realize that the invasions of iraq and afghanistan are n't the only things the us military has ever done right ? 
  you look at a single decade of us military history and then pretend that only events in that decade happened . 
  what a fucking spack . 
   china grew stronger and stronger and even russia is getting ballsy again . 
  instead of investing into your country you invested into the ability to threaten the powerless . 
  you do realize that the us did both right ? 
  it invests in itself , abroad and in its own military . 
  the us military accounts for just a fraction of us gdp . 
  the us only spends 3.3 % of its gdp on its military . 
  russia spends 5.4 % . 
  thanks to being an economic behemoth , the us can spend less as a percentage of its gdp than russia yet spend almost 10x more in real amounts , though i would n't expect somebody as stupid as you to understand this . 
  fact is the us has a larger economy and better standards of living than either russia or china by * far * while maintaining a military more powerful than both combined , which affords it a hell of a lot of influence . 
  also , i 'm not american . 
  i 'm british . 
   the thing about this military is , that beside all its power it only accomplished one thing : costing the us trillions of dollar without achieving anything if you truly believe that you 're an idiot . 
  on top of being a huge technological innovator , the us military puts weight behind american diplomacy . 
  it 's one of the main reasons the us has so much more influence than the eu , which has an economy of a similar size . 
  so no , it did n't only accomplish one thing . 
  it 's not like the us military just suddenly appeared and invaded iraq and afghanistan . 
  it 's thanks to the us military that south korea exists at all . 
  iraq and afghanistan were blunders , i never said otherwise , but believe it or not invading those two countries is not the only thing the us military has ever done . 
  stop reading stuff that is n't there , it 's annoying and just makes you look stupid . 
   the us is a military superpower when it comes to wrecking countries , but not really that much when it comes to achieving something that actually matters for humanity . 
  holy shit , the military designed for crushing other militaries is great at wrecking countries . 
  colour me surprised . 
  also , i never said that the us was an overall humanitarian force for good . 
  it is n't , fucking obviously . 
  but thanks for telling me something irrelevant that the entire planet is already aware of . 
  i never said iraq was a challenge , just proving my point that the us has engaged a military in recent times . 
  ____________  western industrial nations would likely unleash hell on earth if attacked with what ? 
  what the fuck would italy or austria do against the us ? 
  the only nations that could even make a dent are france , uk , russia , china , india and japan . 
  the rest would n't be able to do much , let alone unleash `` hell on earth '' . 
  i never said it was a threat . 
  i was proving a point that the us has fought an actual military in recent times and that you 're an imbecile for calling the us military `` effectively irrelevant '' . 
  without its ridiculous military the us would n't be a superpower and would n't have anywhere near the clout it has now . 
  at the time it was one of the largest forces on earth . 
  either way , the vast majority of countries would fare just as badly against the us as iraq did . 
  a single carrier strike group could crush the average country 's military , and they have 11 . 
  you ca n't do much against that kind of overwhelming power . 
  spinning it like that would be counter-productive , it 's too fuckin ' cool . 
   the us 's military is effectively irrelevant when the only wars they go to is against nations without militarise in the first place . 
  the us military allows them to project their influence across the globe . 
  big-stick diplomacy is still a thing . 
  saying that the us military is `` effectively irrelevant '' only shows your own ignorance . 
   nations without militarise the gulf war was n't even that long ago , when the us completely and utterly annihilated the iraqi military . 
  the portion worth 20 % of $ 1.2 bn that * might * move over . 
  oh god what will we do . 
  there will of course be some more shifting of staff to the continent . 
  london is still going to be the largest financial center in the world next to new york though , so it 's doubtful that they 'd more staff than the bare minimum . 
  sorry , did n't know that you were just misunderstanding me . 
  thought you were being a deliberately obtuse asshole . 
  edited my comment to make it less belligerent . 
  ah , my mistake . 
  it is irrelevant to the point i 'm making . 
  making it illegal to sell an unhealthy food is something a nanny state would do . 
  whether i live in one of the worst nanny-states in europe is * completely * irrelevant . 
  yeah , the general example makes more sense . 
  greece is doing better than before but they 're still chin-deep in shit at the minute . 
  he used greece as an example of `` doing well '' at first , he 's since edited the comment . 
  where i 'm from is irrelevant as fuck . 
  making food illegal because it 's unhealthy is retarded and nanny state as shit . 
  why would you want the eu to become a nanny state telling you what you can and ca n't eat ? 
  transfats are unhealthy but * everyone * knows this . 
  let people eat what they want to eat . 
  20 % of ~ ~ $ 384 mil ~ ~ $ 1.2 bn moving to paris . 
  nothing major . 
  posted by / u/chrisporter - ________________ no , it 's 20 % of this one division , not 20 % of the entire bank it states the profit made by this division in the article :  hsbc 's global banking and markets division that houses those trading jobs made profits of $ 384 million in the uk in 2015 , according to a company filing . 
  so 20 % of that , still a large amount but not 20 % of 140 billion ___________ not quite $ 1.2 bn, 
   greece  23 % unemployment rate  doing well their unemployment rate may be falling but they 're * far * from doing well . 
  from 24.5 % to 23 % over the course of a year . 
  not fantastic , let 's be honest . 
  edit - he used greece as an example of `` doing well '' at first , he 's since edited the comment . 
  because it 's the second largest economy in europe , news regarding the uk economy is more important than news regarding the economy of , say , portugal . 
  she said that parliament would get to vote on the final deal between the eu and uk . 
  nothing about them getting a say in whether a50 is triggered or not . 
  theresa may announced literally yesterday that britain is leaving the single market . 
  keep up with the damn news . 
  there is certainty . 
  we 're certainly leaving the eu and we 're certainly leaving the single market . 
  exactly , and it 's already tanked . 
  i 'm not saying that actually leaving the eu wo n't have negative economic effects , but we wo n't be * that * much worse off after properly leaving , definitely not as bad as some people on here are saying . 
  what ? 
  investors make moves * before * events , how does it not make any sense ? 
  you 're not wrong , the cost of living does offset our high earnings and makes our minimum wage a bit shit . 
  if we earned as much as we do here in , say , spain , our quality of life would be amazing . 
  it 's still good that wages are growing though . 
  if that was the case then the markets would have already crashed in anticipation of the great economy calamity . 
  it 's only natural that you dutch would hate us . 
  we 're an island surrounded by ocean and all you do is try to fight the ocean . 
  if you keep expanding out you 're gon na connect us to europe with a land-bridge eventually , and that wo n't do . 
  i never said it was being downvoted into oblivion , i just do n't understand the reasoning for anyone downvoting news of this kind for any nation . 
  does n't make sense . 
  if i saw some news saying that germany or france 's economy ( okay maybe not france ) were doing well , at the worst i just would n't upvote . 
  down-voting stuff like this is pretty pathetic . 
   the number of full-time workers was 209,000 higher at 23.25 million people , while the total of part-time employees jumped 86,000 to 8.55 million . 
  a lot more full-time jobs than part-time .
