`` hey you , retired man !, 
  what would may do if spain invaded ? '', 
  `` erm probably fight to be honest . '', 
  `` the british in their daily-mail addled brains have declared they want to destroy the holy eu , annex spain and probably kill jesus again / r/europe must unite '', 
  shh . 
  they were good continental boys they never laid a finger on nobody . 
  then i 'd be a part of scotland . 
  fuck that . 
  more than one thing is getting triggered today, 
  stalin was voted as the 2nd greatest russian in a russian poll , i 'm sure bismarck would be considered one of the greatest germans too despite his anti-semitism , anti-catholicism and nationalistic tendencies . 
  cromwell is a monster but also an amazing military commander who remade the military , conquered ireland and scotland and did the unthinkable and deposed a monarchy in the 1600s . 
  if the poll means `` greatest '' as in the britons who accomplished the most or the largest feats cromwell should probably be included but that does n't mean people think he 's a good person . 
  take them with a pinch of salt , extra history is notoriously unreliable,

  yeah you 'd also have to factor in people voting for any party not just the ones they think might win etc. 
  but the lib dems lost a lot of seats so it 'd probably be ukip + cons + some ni parties and even then it probably would n't be enough, 
  like disraeli said `` england does not love coalitions , '' . 
  plus under a proportional system i do n't think any coalition could even be made in the uk . 
  seeing some similarities here, 
  also `` less educated '' is a phrase which makes everyone think these voters seem like idiots when in reality it can mean a few things . 
  pvv voters could be older , older voters are less likely to have gone into higher education for a multitude of reasons such as simply not needing to . 
  it could also simply mean pvv voters are poorer and ca n't afford university or needed to get a job immediately after their education in order to support their family or whatever . 
  as a counterpoint to this - the republicans and democrats are extremely varied and represent a wide range of views thus being representative . 
  blue dogs vs sanders , trump vs libertarian republicans . 
  remember that claim someone on here made ( and was upvoted for ) that the british live in fear and anger of the channel tunnel ? 
   i do n't know that governments change after elections  but ... the referendum happened under the same government . 
  i have to ask , does it actively hurt ? 
  so cameron called a referendum and may is prime minister now and it 's the same government ? 
  so may is really just cameron in drag ? 
  glasgow generation, 
  i did n't say that i said facts are more reliable than predictions, 
  the argument during brexit though was `` well we 're okay now but leave the eu and we 'll have no deal with america , every company will leave , all the migrants will leave , the calais jungle will be opened . '', 
  with indyref it 's not about making predictions it 's literally `` in your budget right now you have a worse deficit than greece '' . 
  it 's actually information we can look at and not predictions . 
  but we do n't need experts to make predictions on the scottish economy it had a worse deficit than greece and is n't now, 
  and then support for independence went up . 
  either they refuse and support goes up or they allow it and support goes up . 
  n o r t h u m b r i a o r t h u m b r i a, 
  that 's what they said about it the last time, 
  2022 then, 
  `` turkish protesters stamp on toothpaste to protest the netherlands '', 
  english mps outvote scottish mps because london has a larger population than all of scotland . 
   scotland has run a deficit only since 2015 , and this has happened only because for 30 + years england has stolen the north sea oil revenues from scotland and used it to fund the wealth of the se of england , otherwise scotland would have been as wealthy as norway without being dragged by england . 
   http://www.gov.scot/publications/2016/08/2132  excluding north sea revenue , was a deficit of # 12.7 billion ( 8.6 per cent of gdp ) . 
   including an illustrative geographic share of north sea revenue , was a deficit of # 12.6 billion ( 8.1 per cent of gdp ) . 
  north sea oil is n't worth much, 
   scotland wales and ni get more mps per capita than england  all running at a defecit . 
  scotland in particular has a worse defecit than greece  england only country without it 's own unique parliament  the union only serves the interests of england and lies and ignores the other `` constituent nations '' blatantly, 
  the idea is that if a ref is held it 'll show more support for the union and the snp wo n't be able to drum up support for a while but that did n't happen after the first one, 
  a study came out that children born during the blair years were more nationalist and authoritarian than those born under thatcher .

  try posting anything good about the uk and watch it get buried . 
  i posted an article from the financial times saying `` uk budget to reveal sharp upgrade in economic forecasts '' and right now it 's actually positive on +4 but with only 59 % upvoting it . 
  41 % of the community saw that headline and went to downvote . 
  there was a cartoon made a month or two ago with a remainer looking at the uk economy and saying `` bad news ; it 's good news '' . 
  but you 'd never be able to find anything positive about the uk or brexit on here and it helps fuel this narrative that the uk 's falling apart .

  philip hammond is preparing to reveal a sharp lift in this year 's economic forecasts in the budget on wednesday , increasing his # 27bn war chest to dole out pre-election sweeteners . 
  the chancellor will say that growth is set to rise to about 2 per cent in 2017 and there will be a significant fall in borrowing . 
  the upgrade reflects the momentum in the economy late last year not captured in the autumn statement . 
  february 's weaker service sector pmi and expected office for budget responsibility forecasts of slower growth this year are not severe enough to dent a near - # 12bn improvement in public borrowing compared with the autumn statement forecasts for 2016-17 . 
  the treasury is trying to keep a tight rein on spending , and mr hammond has said there is no `` pot of money '' to be spent . 
  he redesigned his borrowing rule in the autumn statement to leave a # 27bn cushion in 2020 but is thought to be unwilling to dip into this money until the economic effects of britain 's exit from the eu are more certain . 
  but he is likely to announce measures in the budget to ease the transition for some companies to higher business rates and provide more money for elderly and disabled care . 
  making good on his pledge not to `` make significant changes twice a year just for the sake of it '' , he will leave big tax initiatives until his first autumn budget . 
  the service sector pmis suggest the economy increased 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of the year , enough to raise the 2017 growth rate close to 2 per cent . 
  if that rate were sustained all year , it would be enough to push the growth forecast above 2 per cent . 
  most economists have not yet updated their forecasts to reflect the revisions to the data , so the budget forecasts are likely to be well in excess of the 1.4 per cent average of independent forecasters for 2017 . 
  the chancellor 's near - # 12bn windfall on the public finances in 2016-17 comes from changes to the way corporation tax receipts are measured and higher than expected income tax , capital gains tax and value added tax receipts . 
  the obr has warned that the gains in 2016-17 are not likely to last . 
  it said people `` should not necessarily assume that a large undershoot of the forecast this year would feed through fully into future years '' . 
  business sentiment towards the year ahead remained optimistic , however , `` suggesting that firms are not especially pessimistic about the near-term outlook '' , according to paul hollingsworth of capital economics . 
  i think the people there were always supporters it 's just that it was way more tongue in cheek back then . 
  eventually people realized he actually had a shot at a few states and wanted a place to discuss it .
