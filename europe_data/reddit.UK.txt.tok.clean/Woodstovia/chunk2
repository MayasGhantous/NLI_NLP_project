  labour argues that copeland was a very unique seat - it 's economy revolves around a nuclear power station and corbyn is anti nuclear energy so labour losing there does n't represent the country as a whole however stoke is more representative and supposed to be part of ukip 's northern strategy of turning the working class away from labour . 
  the conservatives argue that swinging such a safe seat away from labour is a massive result despite local issues and that ukip ran a very poor campaign in stoke with nutall committing a series of gaffes in the run up to the election . 
  uk the conservatives won copeland which is a really big deal . 
  it was a safe labour seat since the 30s and it 's extremely , extremely rare for the party in government to win a by-election . 
  labour managed to hold stoke though and are trying to shift the narrative to `` copeland does n't matter we destroyed ukip '',
