  shhh it 's / r/europe, 
  how have we had our cake and ate it and still complained ? 
  if you 're having to scare other countries into not leaving maybe re-think the eu, 
  `` we 're all europeans united in love < 3 '' `` fuck those racist island monkeys '', 
  well i mean the schultz train has fallen into a ditch and it 's obvious he 'll be spanked by merkel in the election, 
  i kept chickens as a kid and a fox killed them all so i may be biased, 
  not really , she said she would n't use whips and would let it be a free vote , it 's just something she 's personally in favour of, 
  i mean when the eu 's president is leaking ( false or real ) private conversations and tries to set you up to look stupid , then calls you deluded it 's hard to want to keep a positive relationship with the eu . 
  continental logic, 
  `` now i 'm a peaceful loving european and we all know how much we love all europeans but we should gas the island monkeys and make them pay for it tbh . 
  not scotland though because they 're a smaller country and i want to see what 'd happen if they were on their own . '', 
  mp for rochdale, 
  the labour party elects their leaders through an election all members of the party are allowed to vote in . 
  the people that join the labour party are usually going to be the more politically active left wing people in society since your average swing voter probably wo n't join a party , this meant that those people elected corbyn because of his very left wing stances which are more unpalatable with most voters . 
  this has created a big divide within labour with the centrists and corbyn supporters disagreeing a lot . 
  a vote of no confidence was overwhelmingly passed by centrist labour mps but the corbynite party members called it a blairite conspiracy to try and get rid of socialist elements of the party and just elected corbyn again . 
  but you vote on things other than policies - take leadership for example . 
  the labour mps have passed votes of no confidence against him and claim he ca n't actually run and organize meetings , a labour mp left an event crying because a member of momentum said the jews were controlling the media and she was part of a jewish conspiracy while corbyn did nothing to intervene . 
  his right hand man john mcdonnell is a self described marxist who said he was glad for the 2008 financial crisis and was recently talking at a communist rally . 
  and then there 's diane abbott who has gone on rants about how she hates white people and is just really stupid . 
  listen to this recent interview for example - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbtivxn_lce there are plenty of reasons to not vote corbyn , even if you do agree with his policies and you ca n't attribute it all to a massive propaganda campaign . 
  well he threatened us , here he 's just being positive about macron, 
  well the idea is that with the conservatives so high in the polls it 'd be essentially a 6 vs 1 with all the other parties ganging up on her instead of also arguing with each other . 
  unlikely . 
  if ukip got 1 seat with 13 % they wo n't get many at 7 % .

  he asked why people vote for the tories , it 's an important point to argue that the opposition would n't be competent . 
  they devote their life to helping the country and give up any sense of normalcy . 
  i was talking about the presidential system which is a majoritarian 2 round system, 
  [ here 's one from closer to ireland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wonvirspri4 ), 
  the turnout went up after the iraq war but people were very happy with blair because the economy was doing well . 
   ok so you 're ignorant of french politics and organisation of parliamentary elections . 
  that 's kewl good argument  yeah . 
  unrepresentative and therefore undemocratic . 
  we know . 
  so the uk has representative democracy where the idea is you vote for someone to best represent your views because humans can often be individualistic when society sometimes requires collectivist views . 
  if the uk system is designed to create the most stable government possible so that peoples views can continue to be represented and so that those views can be acted on easily . 
  rather than in a coalition where decision making could be strained . 
   i do n't see that happening too much in netherlands , in switzerland . 
  you mean the netherlands where a coalition was formed in 2010 , then collapsed in 2012 requiring early elections ? 
  sounds very stable to me  that 's why dutch turnout reaches 80 % while uk reaches what ? 
  such a low turnout for the most important election should make you question the health of your democracy . 
  you should google a few terms : hapathy , class dealignment and partisan dealignment so the blair government was seen as doing very well leading to hapathy - turnout crashed from the high 70s to the high 50s after blair 's first election because people were happy with the way things were going however partisan and class dealignment was also in effect . 
  blair 's `` new labour '' was disconnected with the old labour many identified with and at the same time a blurring of the class divide in the uk led to a problem where many people do n't identify with the current political parties . 
  i would n't see any of that due to a problem with fptp or the health of our democracy . 
  my beef is that the french government is in it 's 5th republic and you have a very popular candidate wanting to tear that all down and start all over again with a 6th one . 
  while fptp under-represents small parties it ensures stable , consistent one-party governments . 
  using the 2015 results for example you could n't legitimately build any realistic coalition if the method of voting was proportional . 
  a proportional system would likely lead to a carousel of weak unstable coalitions like you see in italy . 
  and it 's not like the government is n't criticized or unpopular in non fptp countries , does n't your president have some polls putting him at 0 % approval ? 
  very pro-labour and lib dem to the point where they 've scared everyone else off, 
  i really disagree with this  fptp / two party system is a complete failure how ? 
  the us and uk are both doing fine as countries and the fptp system has resulted in some remarkably stable governments compared to say italy or france . 
   it 's pretty obvious that the right solution for the uk would be a soft brexit , i.e. 
  the uk leaves as the majority wants but you go for a compromise so that the other half of the population is n't completely ignored . 
  how ? 
  that is n't obvious at all and that 's not how democracy works , your government does n't need to make all sides happy . 
  the majority of voters voted for brexit , the government entrusted to represent those people then decided it was in the best interest of the country to go for a hard brexit . 
  there is n't a need to make sure everyone is heard just to go with what the majority wants . 
   this is just `` the winner takes it all , fuck everyone else '' . 
  it 's not even democratic no that is democratic , everyone votes and then proceeds in the direction the majority voted for , the democratic part is that everyone got a chance to vote . 
   the whole concept that you can only vote on a politician or a party instead of specific laws is bullshit too , but that 's another story but you just trashed the idea of a referendum - voting on specific laws because the losing side would have to be ignored in some way . 
  and no country votes for every law . 
  the only place i could think of doing that would be california and it crashed the economy because everyone voted for higher spending and fewer taxes and then led to gay marriage being legalized then illegalized then legalized because turnout was low and unless voting for a law was well publicized you could basically sneak any shady shit you wanted through .

  from / r/ukpolitics full credit to / u/mimesareshite  59 % believe labour can not win a ge with corbyn in charge 47 % believe the tories will win in a landslide , with only 19 % thinking they wo n't  people are split on whether or not they believe may has their best interests at heart : 38 % believe she does , 40 % believe she does n't  asked who was the better prime minister out of may and cameron , 56 % picked may and 44 % picked cameron . 
  tory ( 73 % ) and ukip ( 74 % ) voters were more likely to pick may , while labour ( 60 % ) and lib dem ( 61 % ) voters more likely to pick cameron . 
   given a choice of may , corbyn , farron and nuttall , 62 % of voters believe that may would make the best prime minister . 
  this compares to 25 % for corbyn , 10 % for farron , and 4 % for nuttall . 
  64 % ukip voters said that may would make the best pm . 
   voters were given a list of issues ( austerity , brexit , economy , immigration , national security and nhs ) and asked to choose the ones most important to them , up to a maximum of three . 
  the nhs and brexit were deemed most important , chosen by 70 % and 68 % of voters respectively ; 54 % picked the economy , 42 % immigration , 24 % national security , and 16 % austerity  for labour voters the most important issue for them in the upcoming election is the nhs ( 85 % ) , for conservatives brexit ( 79 % ) and for ukip voters it 's immigration ( 83 % ) .
