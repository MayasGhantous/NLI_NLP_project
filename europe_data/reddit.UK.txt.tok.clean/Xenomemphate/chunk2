  the issue i have is , if even 1 innocent is executed then it is not worth it , on top of that it is more expensive than just jailing them for the rest of their life . 
  a small portion of the population complaining on the internet is nothing compared to the number of people that were protesting trump and the junior doctors . 
  to imply differently is disingenuous . 
  simply put , the majority of brits do not care , or care very little , about the tories eroding our digital freedoms . 
  they are too concerned about stopping foreigners coming and and leaving the `` undemocratic '' eu . 
   maybe i missed it . 
  you did n't , there were n't any . 
   `` i would be ashamed if i was an american now '' i am pretty ashamed to be called a brit right now . 
  it is a shit state of affairs all round . 
   there 's still a large uproar about the snooper 's charter . 
  is there fuck . 
  nobody with any kind of power , be that media or politicians , even cares about it . 
  the general public does n't give a shit either , it is only people like me and you who do . 
  people are too distracted by brexit to concern themselves with what the tories are doing domestically . 
  especially since we have already invoked article 50 and are leaving . 
  i do n't see why europe should care about which leader takes us out , regardless we are still ( unfortunately in my opinion ) leaving . 
  `` despite ` made in france ' policy '' they claim to play by different rules . 
  trump has many policies but it is hard to figure out what they actually are since he flip-flops back and forth like a plastic bag caught in the wind . 
   expressed as a rule of thumb . 
  except it is a dumb `` rule of thumb '' because carnivores and omnivores exist . 
  `` perhaps best not to feed animals * their own species * '' would have made much more sense , and actually have been accurate . 
   no , infected meat of course . 
  then why bother even stating as much ? 
  i never disagreed that eating infected meat would n't result in it . 
  we had already established that it needs to be an act of cannibalism or to eat infected meat . 
  you do n't get prion diseases just from eating meat . 
   perhaps best not to feed ** animals ** to other ** animals ** it is ridiculous because feeding animals to animals does not cause prion diseases . 
  that is massively simplistic . 
  feeding animals other animals * of their own species or ones already infected * is what leads to it . 
   people have developed cjd from eating meat . 
  uninfected meat ? 
  do you have a source for that because i find that questionable ? 
  pigs are a prion resistant species and that is only applicable if they eat other pigs or infected cattle/sheep . 
  pigs eating beef that is n't infected will not just randomly develop a prion disease . 
  also , your statement is ridiculous . 
  if animals eating other animals was such a worry for prion diseases then carnivores would be full of them , omnivores ( such as pigs ) would also be highly susceptible . 
  hell , humans are technically an `` animal '' yet we do n't develop creutzfeldt-jakob disease just by eating meat . 
  feeding pigs other pigs ? 
  perhaps but as said before they are resistant to prion diseases . 
  one slice of bacon probably wont result in another mad cow disease epidemic . 
  part of being at the top of the food chain means those below you in it do n't really get an opinion on the matter . 
  edit : also , since pigs are omnivores , i imagine they would also enjoy a bit of haggis , or some of a fry up . 
  how about we do n't ? 
  i rather like my fry ups and haggis . 
  so you are saying that every single one of those `` extra '' reports above average were lying ? 
  all the more reason for me to disregard your opinion , especially since you ca n't back it up . 
  `` i do n't need to provide a source to the people who have seen the source . '', 
  no shit sherlock . 
  so no , you can not find a source for that . 
  we just have to believe you about some random video ? 
   and i hope people do n't want the eu to collapse , that 's cruel and sadistic there are plenty that do both on reddit and in reality . 
  and yet i have already quoted you official government figures showing the rise in hate crime documented quite clearly , in line with the brexit referendum , that utterly disputes your claim . 
   for poland , sure . 
  and for the entire eu in general . 
  if money that the uk and germany pays for improvements in poland that then enable poland to be a net contributor , well , that benefits everyone - uk , germany , poland . 
  we do the exact same in the uk - taxes from london help pay for improvements elsewhere . 
   $ 100bn is not banter that is a number pulled out of the financial times ' arse . 
  there have been no official figures released on the cost yet . 
  as has already been asked . 
  can you provide some sources for these officials who are seeking to damage both eu and uk just to see the uk `` punished '' ? 
   on thursday 23 june 2016 , the eu referendum took place and the people of the united kingdom voted to leave the european union . 
  following this result , information released by the national police chiefs ' council ( npcc ) , which covers northern ireland as well as england and wales , showed that there had been an increase in the level of reported and recorded hate crime . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/559319/hate-crime-1516-hosb1116.pdf ) and an article going over the facts and figures from that report : [ from the bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37640982 ) plenty of official stats . 
  what , he is lying about how his acquaintances feel ? 
  are you omniscient that you are able to declare them liars with such certainty ? 
   why is that being interpreted as a punishment ? 
  because we want our cake and to eat it too . 
  the eu is denying us this , thus they are punishing us !, 
  i doubt it sadly , i suspect it will take more than simple facts to burst the bubble of delusion that comes with british exceptionalism . 
   shorties drown natural selection in action . 
  positively darwinist . 
  as a side note both the dutch people i went to uni with were on the tall side so i can see that . 
  source ? 
   height person height or country height because i was under the impression that if it was the latter , you guys are mostly negative height ? 
   i am sure you can point to some examples yes ? 
  so , no , you ca n't ? 
   literally all anglo countries that exist in the world today are better run countries than any of europe . 
  source for that ? 
  the us is a shambles , australia is having issues . 
  the only `` anglo '' country that is n't a fucking mess these days is canada , including the uk . 
  if you are so certain the uk is much better than the continent culturally , and politically , in every way compared to the entire continent i am sure you can point to some examples yes ? 
   there is no appetite for political integration with what most of us perceive to be countries several decades behind us both culturally and politically ( and certainly economically ) . 
  `` we refuse to work with you because we are better than you . '', 
  there is the british exceptionalism we all know and hate . 
   we fundamentally disagree with the entire project . 
  we will be living in huts sparking stones together long before we look eastwards for a friend . 
  maybe you want to regress back to the stone age but some of us are more than willing to rejoin the eu , should the situation arise where we can . 
  i voted against this lunacy , not for it . 
  your / s was missing . 
  the bus links i use every day , funding their upgrade and refurbishment as well as funding an increase to the number of stops . 
   if your region relies on subsidies it was poor before the eu and numerous reports show that the eu subsidies do very little to improve local economies it was poor before the eu , you are correct . 
  since joining though it has enjoyed quite the boon . 
   in those areas just large vanity projects the transport system i use to get to work every single day was created and funded by the eu . 
  before that it was utter shit . 
  westminster did n't care and i do n't expect them to in 2 years either . 
   trade wont cease . 
  no but it will be more expensive . 
  a 0 % tariff rate can only go one direction at this stage . 
   immigration wo n't cease either and it is already so heavily restricted as to make it really difficult for immigrants to settle up here . 
  that is only going to get worse , not better .
