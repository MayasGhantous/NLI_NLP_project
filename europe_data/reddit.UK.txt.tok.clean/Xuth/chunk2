  stem is seen as brilliant , and people are jealous of those with the capacity to get onto a stem course . 
  the manual labour category is seen as jobs the people who did n't go to university do - i 'll admit there 's a class based edge to that as there is with a lot of things in the uk . 
  growing up middle class , there was never a question that i 'd end up as a tradesman - even though i may have enjoyed it and it does pay relatively well here ( pluming especially ) . 
  i chose journalism most especially ** not ** for the pay . 
  i saw my father work away at an it job and be bloody miserable at it . 
  i wanted something that was interesting , something i did n't mind bringing up in conversation . 
  after university i had to re-shift onto more practical jobs to get money - and then the wage became all important . 
  ** since a few countries have higher education subsidized by their governments , is the entire notion of incurring massive debts to pursue a degree unthinkable for you ? 
  ( similar to the concept of debts from medical bills ) or for countries who do not have free access , how has this affected your choice ( or not ) to attend higher education ? 
  ** knowing that my actual tuition was taken care of up front by the government , i honestly never thought about it . 
  it was ** never ** a consideration before university , and would never be something to put you off . 
  we also got an interest free loan to allow us to live and such . 
  you pay this off based on your earnings and only once you start to earn over # 15,000 per year and comes off of my wage like a tax - i never even see the tiny segment which it deducted . 
  in my previous job i was paying back # 5 a month !, 
  if you 've not paid it off by a certain time in the future then the debt is wiped . 
  even now , unemployed , it 's not something i have to think about . 
  ** following the theme of debt from a lack of free public access to basic human needs or rights ( forgive me if that 's inflammatory ) , do you have an overall lessened or non-existent worry and stress over finding , or keeping , a job that provides you with medical insurance benefits ? 
  does this being a non-factor in your search allow you more freedom of mobility to change jobs ? 
  the concept of finding a job based on how good their medical coverage is is insane . 
  as i 've said , i 'm unemployed right now and although i am concerned about things like rent and utilities i know that even if i get a major illness i 've nothing to worry about financially ( in fact , in a sick way , being in hospital would reduce my house bills ! ), 
  i 've paid a tiny fraction of national insurance ( the nhs funding tax ) in my brief career , yet i 'm eligible for every medical procedure a multi-millionaire managing director who 's paid ni for 50 years is . 
  the thing which reduces my job mobility is simply how good or bad the job market is for openings . 
  ** what examples of occupations in the other threads are not common in your country , and vice versa ? 
  ** not really applicable ... 
  i spotted the same types of jobs that are common here . 
  engineers , software devs , marketing , pr , banking etc. 
  mostly jobs in the services sector which is pretty much the british economy . 
  ** is there much corruption ( visible or suspected ) within certain sectors ? 
  government work , education , emergency and medical work . 
  ** hard to say from my very limited experience . 
  unless you count the fact that people will do just about anything to get their own friends and family jobs - knowing someone is 90 % of the application process it seems . 
  ** what does life mean to you ? 
  a linear progression of school , job , work , then die or something different ? 
  ** at this point ( mid-twenties ) just getting a job where i can live a happy life out of my job . 
  i dont think i 'll ever make much of a career-man unless i do make it back into journalism . 
  i 'll take a well-enough paid office job and enjoy life with my family and friends . 
  i may even retrain to something else . 
  bloody hell . 
  my longest comment ever ... this is what happens when an unemployed journalist ca n't sleep . 
  ** the united kingdom ** - the news about the syrian chemical attack has been the most prominent - the us and uk are promising ` serious ' action next . 
  foreign secretary william hague seems to be getting much more vocal in opposition to assad , demanding action from the un . 
  i 'm not sure how to feel that this is * far , far * bigger news than : - david miranda 's arrest . 
  the guardian attempts to fight for our right to privacy , the conservatives are looking more and more scary every day , the opposing labour party appear to have fallen asleep . 
  sadly most broadcast news outlets ( the bbc especially ) are n't covering it as much , neither are many of the other newspapers . 
  we 've also heard about other european news editors taking a stand against cameron . 
  meanwhile , the people of britain ... honestly i do n't feel much of a reaction at least within my family and friends . 
  - the royals released the first official pictures of the new prince ... unsure if anyone actually gave a shit . 
  - a helicopter crashed off the coast of scotland , four people died and their bodies recovered . 
  another 14 people were rescued after the helicopter apparently suffered a `` catastrophic loss of power '' . 
  all other helicopters of the same design have been grounded pending an investigation . 
  - a man has been arrested in north london over the shooting and killing of a 24 year old woman who was out celebrating her birthday . 
  police are saying that she was just `` in the wrong place at the wrong time '' and was n't the intended target . 
  the murdered woman has a four year old son . 
  another 24 year old woman is still in hospital . 
  - the labour party threaten to block the new high speed rail plans in parliament ( to run between london and the northern cities ) if it goes too far over budget . 
  - bonus news : there was a small earthquake in blackpool and barrow-in-furness measuring 2.4 and 3.2 on the richter scale . 
  they 're fairly common in that part of the country , but never strong as you can see . 
  from my point of view : it 's not being completely ignored , but at the same time the coverage is n't anywhere near as big as it should be . 
  far too many of my friends are simply ` lost ' in the recent spy scandal developments - they are vaguely aware that it 's happening but at the same time stuff like cameron 's involvement , most of the specific and darker details are getting lost in the noise . 
  those who do n't read the guardian or chose to get the majority of their news through the bbc are missing a lot of the crucial details which are prevalent here on reddit . 
  i 've just not felt people getting that worked up about it . 
  there few social media reactions ( from what i 've seen ) and it does n't seem a talking point among people once i log off of reddit . 
  i 'd hope this is through ignorance rather than apathy . 
  the front page of the bbc does n't mention a thing at this second and i do n't believe it got much to any airtime on the nightly news . 
  newspapers are the ones making the loudest noise - but even that 's pretty damn muted outside of the guardian . 
  the other problem is that the opposition parties are n't saying a thing either . 
  i do n't think i can even find a quote from the leader of the opposing labour party about any of this ; or any of the shadow cabinet . 
  it 's like they do n't care about it either despite it being political gold for them !, 
  i ca n't see cameron and the lib/con government doing well at the next election , but they should be doing far , far worse all things considered . 
  they were allowed in by the guardian as it was the only way to prevent the british government from using legal action to prevent all reporting of the extent of american and british state surveillance revealed by the document . 
  [ the editor , alan rusbridger , said `` i would rather destroy the copied files than hand them back to the nsa and gchq '' . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/aug/20/alan-rusbridger-miranda-snowden-nsa-gchq-video ) the government were , prior to the destruction , threatening to go through the courts to attain a ` prior restraint ' on any reporting regarding the affair - essentially a news blackout on the subject . 
  but by simply allowing the single hardrive to be destroyed they avoided that . 
  and despite making it fully clear that the data itself was backed up all over the world the government went for it . 
  not to say that the threat of legal action itself was any less sickening as a method to get into that basement . 
  when citizens of a country are actively hoping that an outside force puts a ban-hammer on the actions their own government , you know that shit is n't right . 
  and i , for one , hope that answers * are * forced out of parliament by the eu . 
  * whisky and cigars . 
  seems like a fair prediction from my point of view . 
  the city shopping centres here ( ` the high street ' ) are going through a rough time of it as more people just buying online . 
  the only reason i use physical shops now is for clothing and food ( 50 % of the time anyway ) . 
  every time i stand in a shop and look at the prices my default reaction is inevitably : `` i can get that cheaper online '' . 
  in fact i often use physical shops as a showroom where i 'm able to have a look at the item but then shop around online to find it cheaper . 
  shops like argos might survive well enough though , as the tail end of the article suggests . 
  [ all hail our supreme overlords , tesco . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/0psyirxieyc?t=35s ), 
  pretty sure the uk/ireland result is down to classic `` an englishman , an irishman and a scotsman ... '' jokes . 
  such as :  a englishman an irishman and a scotsman find an evil wizard on the top of a tall cliff . 
   the wizard orders them to jump off the cliff , but he also promises that if they say anything while falling , they will get it at the bottom of the cliff . 
   so first , the englishman jumps off the cliff and shouts , `` pillows ! '', 
  and so he lands on some pillows . 
   then the scotsman jumps off the cliff , and he shouts , `` hay ! '', 
  and so he lands on some hay . 
   finally the irishman runs to jump off the cliff , but he trips on a rock just before the jump and says , `` aw , shite ! '', 
  depending on who 's telling the story it 's the others who are the stupid ones . 
   an englishman , an irishman and a scotsman were taking part in a survey about tea-drinking habits . 
   ' i always stir my tea with my left hand , ' said the englishman . 
   ' i always stir my tea with my right hand , ' said the scotsman . 
   ` how about you ? ', 
  the irishman was asked .
