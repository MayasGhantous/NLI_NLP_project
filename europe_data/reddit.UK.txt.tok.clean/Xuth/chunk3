  said the irishman , ' i always use a spoon . ', 
  but what 's the definition of broadband here ? 
  i 'm in a very rural part of england with bt on one of their ` broadband ' packages , with a broadband router and everything , and [ this ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/2898985589 ) is my result a few minutes ago . 
  yet i recently lived in a town just down the road where my broadband result was [ this ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/2825542871 ) !, 
  well , no one 's done it yet so : the current design dates from the union of great britain and ireland in 1801 . 
  the flag combines aspects of three older national flags : the [ red cross of st george ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/flag_of_england.svg ) for england and wales ( wales was always seen as part of england in historical times ) , the [ white saltire of st andrew ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/flag_of_scotland.svg ) for scotland ( which were previously united in the [ first union flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/union_flag_1606_%28kings_colors%29.svg ) , and the red saltire of [ saint patrick 's flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/st_patrick%27s_saltire.svg ) to represent ireland . 
  if the scottish get independence then the flag may well look like [ this ] ( http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/01437/snn1406gxb-682_1437682a.jpg ) . 
  which is why independence is a really bad idea ... also , there is a right way up and a wrong way up . 
  it 's totally possible to hang the flag upside-down and face death by queen lizzie 's royal death corgis . 
  in short : the st patrick 's line on the side closest to the flag pole should be touching the bottom of the flag and not the side . 
  i love kenal mint cake so much . 
  best energy bar there is . 
  well it depends . 
  from my point of view scandinavians tend to do rp british accents outstandingly well - to the point where it takes a while to even notice there 's an edge of something else in there . 
  [ sidse babett knudsen ] ( http://youtu.be/yn41flr1s1a?t=11s ) , for example , does an absolutely * impeccable * accent . 
  also , i went to university with a danish guy who i presumed was english for two months . 
  besides , with the current british love affair for all things danish some of us even find the proper danish accent ^ a ^ ^ little ^ ^ ^ bit ^ ^ ^ ^ sexy . 
   a spokesman for the ministry of defence said the annual cougar deployment was `` long-planned and well-established '' . 
   `` elements of last year 's cougar \u201912 deployment visited gibraltar and the forthcoming visit by ships making up cougar ' 13 , including hms westminster and the royal fleet auxiliary ships lyme bay and mounts bay , are business as usual . 
  at the same time , other elements of the task force will be visiting spanish ports as part of the exercises . 
   `` the same phase of the deployment will also see port visits in portugal and throughout the mediterranean to spain , turkey and malta before onward transit to the middle east . '' that was left until the last paragraph of course - both sides ' media are out for a bit of sensationalism at the moment . 
  in all likelihood the uk government will use it as a bit of posturing regardless - but this has n't been planned specifically because of recent events . 
  yea , and that annoying variation spelt : ** lite ** . 
  of all of our overseas territories , gibraltar feels the most british to a ` mainlander ' like me . 
  it kinda feels like a distant extension of cornwall . 
  i 'd happily see them as the 5th country/province within the uk along with england , wales , scotland and northern ireland . 
  but the point is much more how the gibraltans feel about it really !, 
  this supposes that the original utrecht treaty carries the full legal weight of the current status quo . 
  some , such as lincoln ( 1993 ) , take into account issues such as eu and un law , which they argue supersedes utrecht . 
   gibraltar needs to accept the fact that they are not fully independent , and will never be , and so any dispute with spain should have been left alone and dealt with through the uk , instead of them making that rather provocative `` reef building '' - move on their own . 
  just going to quote myself from an earlier thread on this matter to try and give another side of the discussion ( it does n't quite line up with the discussion of the reef itself - but i think it addresses your point above somewhat ) :  firstly i need to wave my flag and admit that i will be naturally biased here as brit . 
  however , i just wanted to add another viewpoint to the discussion and aim to keep this as neutral as i can . 
  i will happily take on responses , of course . 
  my aim here is to present facts as i know them . 
  for background : i studied this political situation in depth at university . 
   the uk government bases it 's current position on the wishes of the gibraltan people who voted in 2002 by a factor of 98.48 % to 1.03 % to oppose the shared sovereignty of the territory . 
   before that , the uk and spanish governments were openly sitting down and discussing the subject of sharing control of the land . 
   without the consent of the people however , it would be wrong , in the eyes of the current british administration , to discuss terms on their behalf . 
  this has been a relatively recent double u-turn . 
   an often stated rebuttal of this claim is to call upon the un resolution resolution 1514 ( 14 december 1960 ) . 
  this resolution talks about the need of ` territorial integrity ' with regards to colonies and sovereign territories . 
  so spain 's claim is to return the rock to iberia , if you will . 
   however britain , and in this context the peoples of gibraltar , believe that another section of un resolution 1514 supersedes that particular clause wherein all peoples have the right to self-determination . 
  moreover , the united nations ( in resolution 2734 , nov 1969 ) established that the size of a territory should have no baring on it 's ability to exercise it 's resolution 1514 rights . 
  this would also extend to ceuta and melilla of course , so there is a degree of hypocrisy on both sides !, 
   when it comes to the use of the treaty of utrecht , the spanish government believes that the treaty recognised british possession , but not sovereignty , of gibraltar . 
   however , in response to spanish claims that the treaty of utrecht precludes gibraltarian self-determination , according to u.n. general assembly resolution 2734 , the principles embodied in the u.n. charter supersede obligations under any other international agreement . 
  including that of the treaty of utrecht . 
   if , therefore , the british government chose to argue continued sovereignty based on the words of the treaty , then you ( and i for that matter ! ), 
  can loudly call hypocrisy . 
   so , generally , the world has changed so much since 1705 that using the original treaty as the basis of discussion is now difficult at best . 
  while not a perfect situation , decisions made 200 years ago and by virtue of the sustained population since , we get today 's status quo . 
  pack onto that the 200 years of superseding , un , eu , british and spanish law and returning to a pre-1705 gibraltar would be exceedingly difficult and problematic . 
   tl : dr : the current position of the uk is that the people of gibraltar have an international right to self-determination and discussions of complete or joint sovereignty can only happen if the people of gibraltar want it to happen . 
  the spanish on the other-hand contend that sovereignty should be based on territorial integrity . 
   i apologise for any spelling and grammar mistakes - it 's far too early in the morning !, 
  edit : found an annoying spelling mistake at the beginning !,

  the saddest part is knowing that my government could never carry this out with the same degree of success even if they wanted to . 
  nope , nothing . 
  our passports , like all eu passports i believe , do contain the rfid chip . 
  i have used that on several occasions when travelling back to the uk ( the queues are usually much shorter on the automated chip passport control stations ) . 
  but the chip is useless for anything but international travel . 
  other than that i 'd say that most people use their drivers licenses . 
  i even know a few non-drivers who bought a provisional ( learners ) license just so they had some form of identification . 
  otherwise , the closest thing we have is the [ citizencard ] ( http://www.citizencard.com/ ) . 
  but as i said in the post above , it 's not for official use and you would n't be able to use it to open a bank account , say , or when dealing with the police in a serious matter . 
  this card is literally just for when you get id 'd for cigarettes and alcohol , etc. 
  here in the uk we went through a massive and angry debate into the subject . 
  they were briefly active but then quickly scrapped again . 
  now there is very little political will to ever reactivate the scheme . 
  they were discussed and planned in 2006 by the labour government and given the go-ahead . 
  * [ from the wikipedia article  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/identity_cards_act_2006 ) *  many of the concerns focused on the databases underlying the identity cards . 
  the act specified ** fifty ** categories of information for each each citizen , including up to 10 fingerprints , a digitised facial scan and iris scan , current and past uk and overseas places of residence of all residents of the uk throughout their lives , and indexes to other government databases ( including national insurance number ) -- which would have allowed them to be connected . 
  the legislation on this resident register also said that any further information could be added at a later date .
