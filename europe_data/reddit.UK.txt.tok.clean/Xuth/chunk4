  then in 2009 they were given to people who asked for one ( i believe the uptake was understandably low ) . 
  although they were planned to be mandatory it never got to that stage . 
  they were scrapped completely in 2010 when the conservative/libdem coalition came to power . 
  those id cards are now no longer valid in the uk . 
  * [ from the home office website  ( https://www.gov.uk/identity-cards-and-new-identity-and-passport-service-suppliers ) *  under the terms of the identity documents act 2010 , identity cards ceased to be legal documents on 21 january 2011 . 
  the government introduced the identity documents act 2010 which received royal assent on 21 december 2010 . 
  the act brings into law :  the cancellation of the uk national identity card ;  the identification card for eea nationals ;  the provision for the destruction of the national identity register ;  your identity card ceased to be be a valid legal document for confirming your identity on 21 january 2010 . 
  when formal identity is needed people use their driving licenses or passports . 
  for simple stuff like proving age there is an id card scheme - but it can only be used for stuff like buying alcohol or getting into pubs ; for official ( police etc ) purposes you would need to produce your passport/drivers license . 
  there is no legal need to carry id with you in the uk . 
  it 's only slander ( well , libel as this is written ) if you say it as a statement of fact ( in uk law at least ) , so just add `` in my honest opinion ... '' at the beginning and you 're set !, 
  a copy and paste of a comment i made on another thread about this topic , since people seem to question if it 's actually our ` first ' astronaut or not : helen sharman ( the official first briton into space ) did so as part of a private scheme between a british business consortium and russia . 
  michael foale flew under an american flag and on behalf of nasa . 
  despite his retained uk citizenship , britain had very little to do with him getting into space and he never really ` represented ' us . 
  mark shuttleworth ( space tourist ) has dual south african and british citizenship but chose to fly with a south african flag on his uniform . 
  nicholas patrick became a us citizen in 1994 to fly with nasa . 
  piers sellers did the same in 1992 . 
  as stupid as it sounds , maj. peake is being portrayed ( as a result of the reasons above ) as our first ` pure ' astronaut . 
  a lot of people have high hopes that this is the start of britain being more proactive with our space involvement and no longer just relying on other countries and private opportunities . 
  the uk government massively stepped up its share of esa funding recently , and re-branded our national space organisation to the ` uk space agency ' . 
  it replaced a number of smaller , often useless , organisations which existed before . 
  as a uk geek this is a very exciting time !, 
  it 's something europe does very well together . 
  i 'd love to think that the first manned mission to mars might be a joint american and european one . 
  also ...  an international space station to which britain has never contributed funds . 
  is n't quite true . 
  many out of date sources **** cough **** * this journalist used wikipedia to check his facts * **** cough **** reatain this fact because previous parliaments did n't place human space flight as a fundable project . 
  now , however , the uk currently invests # 240m a year to the esa - making us the third largest net contributor . 
  and the tories ( as much as i hate most of their policies ) are pledging an extra # 60m a year while in term . 
  the important fact is , however , that out of that esa funding comes a specifically ring-fenced # 16m in funding for the iss !, 
  i mean , yes , it 's a shamefully modest amount - but it 's not zero anymore . 
  helen sharman ( the official first briton into space ) did so as part of a private scheme between a british business consortium and russia . 
  maj. tim peake will be the first to enter space while backed by the british government , esa , and their money . 
  thus he becomes our first ` official ' british astronaut if you will . 
  michael foale flew under an american flag and on behalf of nasa , so we somewhat discount him ( as unfair as that may be ) . 
  despite his retained uk citizenship , britain had very little to do with him getting into space and he never really ` represented ' us . 
  mark shuttleworth ( space tourist ) has dual south african and british citizenship but chose to fly with a south african flag on his uniform .

  uk : the uk average speed is [ 12mbit/s ] ( http://media.ofcom.org.uk/2013/03/14/average-uk-broadband-speeds-hit-double-figures/ ) and as such we are fairly behind on the internet stakes . 
  that 's not to say that we 're all so slow though - i 'm on 100mbit/s fibre optic for example . 
  virgin media are currently pushing out 120mbit/s which should be available in the next year . 
  and 1gbps ? 
  ahahahahaha ... oh , yea , i wish . 
  not even a distant hope yet . 
  ** fibre optic : ** on virgin media ( 100-120mbps ) - # 25/month ( $ 30/month ) on bt ( 76mbps ; max speed on their cables ) - # 25/month ( $ 30/month ) on sky ( 38mbps max ) - # 15/month - ( $ 18/month ) * note that with the above we typically buy it with tv packages and that this is the most common way to buy broadband here . 
  so you pay around # 50-100 / month and get your tv ( tivo/sky box/bt box ) , phone and broadband from one provider . 
  * these ones are standalone broadband which fewer people typically get : on ee ( 38mbps max ) - # 16/month ( $ 18.70 / month ) on plusnet ( 76mbps ) - # 18.32 / month ( $ 21/month ) on talktalk ( 76mbps ) - # 19.00 / month ( $ 23/month ) bare in mind that many people ca n't get virgin media in their location , and likewise not everyone can get bt fibre either . 
  so they will end up on standard copper wire broadband below : ** copper broadband : ** on bt ( 16-20mbps ) - # 15/month on plusnet ( 16-20mbps ) - # 16/month and the rest in this category are much the same . 
  the big tv providers ( sky , virgin and bt ) will also give non-fibre broadband around these speeds for a little bit less money than their fibre packages . 
   to all those things we do have in common social alcoholism ? 
  i 'll drink to that !, 
  sk\u00e5l . 
  i believe that today is the only day that british government buildings ( including parliament and downing street ) fly the eu flag ... not that anyone else in the country is aware of why though . 
  edit : actually it seems that the tories may have abandoned this trend [ requirement ? ], 
  and downing street does n't fly it even today . 
  it 's basically the west wing in a more familiar european political setting . 
  so on that basis it 's brilliant . 
  it 's well written , well acted , and has well developed characters ... it has the qualities i 'm used to seeing in british tv ( american tv can sometimes overplay action instead of focusing on good dialogue and clever drama ) . 
  it also acts as an education for us non-danes to some interesting problems you have , such as the troubled relationship with greenland . 
  hell , i 've even started to pick up a few words of dansk as a result !, 
  we like your tv shows too . 
  good work denmark . 
  interesting how clearly the old danelaw border shows up in the uk : [ map here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/england_878.svg/250px-england_878.svg.png ) [ scroll down to / u/phenomenos comment for a higher resolution of this map ! ], 
  so , ta for the good lookin ' dna scandinavia !, 
  edit : just found an summary of the genetics of britain if anyone is interested : [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bryan_sykes#blood_of_the_isles ) . 
  some may be surprised by the comment about the ( lack of ) saxon influence . 
  absolutely . 
  one thing to understand is that britain is so densely populated that in certain parts ` village ' does n't necessarily create images of picturesque countryside idyllics . 
  even in places where families are not all that poor - if there 's not much going on locally , and the ` chav ' culture is strong enough in the nearest big town , then it can easily spread throughout the kids via peer pressure and trend following . 
  social mobility is notoriously low in the uk too - betterment is n't something people necessarily aspire to . 
  if someone 's parents are poor and ` chavy ' they are far more likely to follow their lifestyle instead . 
  i grew up a few miles from [ this hamlet ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/ib2zm ) ( pop . 
  and 80 % of the kids there were , and have grown up to be quintessential chavs . 
  but it comes down to where people go to school , and where people go to hang out and whom you hangout with . 
  in a tiny village like that the young people in it will be easily influenced by the places they have to go to to have fun , because there 's nothing to do there . 
  towns near it ( like stevenage and bedford ) have massive chav and council estate cultures . 
  yet a few miles away i grew up in a village where none of us became chavs - just because of who we were friends with and where we decided to hang out ( more into sports ) . 
  to be honest though , i 'm just a normal guy observing my limited experiences . 
  this whole subject of britain 's young people could easily be the focus of a sociological study . 
  small towns are even more prone to chavs , actually . 
  usually because there 's even less to do . 
  the smaller and more impoverished a town is ( hell , even villages ) the more chavs you 'll find there . 
  cities have large concentrations , sure , but it 's the places you 've never heard of which have the highest percentages per youth population . 
  that 's brilliant !, 
  i get a real kick out of exploring far flung places from my office chair . 
  dropped into a random town called tapioszele and found a groovy pink house and some chickens chilling out . 
  lake balaton a pretty looking place as well . 
  also , did the rest of eastern europe get added recently ? 
  i dont remember romania and bulgaria having this much coverage ... 
  he 's currently slinking around middle england with that euro-skeptic tourettes of his , making ex-toryites and oaps froth at the gash . 
  they want to try and nab a load of council seats in next month 's elections . 
  they 've called it the [ ` common sense tour ' ] ( http://www.thisissurreytoday.co.uk/ukip-leader-nigel-farage-targets-surrey-voters/story-18731889-detail/story.html#axzz2rdojnt5y ) . 
   the telekom anounces , that they will stop providing internetflatrates in the future .
