well they certainly are n't acting like it . 
  turkey has been supplying arms to isis . 
  then they raided the newspapers that released the information about them doing that . 
  their interests seem plenty clear to me . 
  edit :[ just thought i 'd add the reddit thread with more information for those interested . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3jerfh/turkish_daily_exposes_transfer_of_weapons_to_isis/ ), 
  this fucking crisis has brought out the worst in humanity i swear . 
  on both sides . 
   these beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new spanish navy can get a really good look at the old spanish navy . 
  i think this was my favourite part . 
  it 's different from the rest . 
  i 've got a copy of it at my parents house . 
  i 'll grab it next time i go back to visit . 
  i feel like you may have highlighted a comment before you hit reply . 
  i * still * have n't read that book . 
  picture 10 has a child using their dad as a mattress . 
  oddly cute . 
  i 'm quite disappointed in a lot of my countries attitudes are to be honest . 
  i actually got gilded by someone in an [ askreddit thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/3jqrz1/european_redditors_what_are_your_opinions_about/curj4sj ) for my general opinion on it . 
  so yeah , you can say you 're disappointed in how the uk is handling it and i 'd agree . 
  also , [ i definitely commented in that thread you linked ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3k2gwj/im_not_offering_my_home_to_a_syrian_refugee_that/cuu99fe ) calling the article out for bullshit too . 
  i ca n't ever really get behind leaving people to suffer when we could do something to help . 
  especially when we contributed to the clusterfuck that 's made them run from their homes . 
  i know i would n't want to leave my home if i had a choice in the matter . 
  for this amount of people feel the need to run from their * home * ? 
  i ca n't imagine the fear they must feel . 
  you completely took that out of context . 
  first someone complains that he 's not a politician , then someone complains when i suggest that he 's talking about political matters . 
  so it does n't really matter what you think . 
  it seems to me like you 're trying to pick a fight by intentionally ignoring the context of my comment . 
  you wo n't get another response from me so have fun with that . 
  well i 'm glad you guys decided to stick around and i 'm sorry the backlash hit you guys like that . 
  it fucking sucks . 
  that 's actually a really good point . 
  i did n't notice people were quite so ... * impassioned * about the greek crisis though . 
  i ca n't remember the last time i saw so many divisive opinions on reddit than this crisis . 
  if you look at my comment above , you 'll see that i did already know that . 
  he 's a professor of politics , trying to comment on a political insight into a politically complex situation . 
  he should have some tact . 
  as a brit , i like the way germany 's been doing things lately . 
  it 's nice to see you guys around / r/europe more . 
  except in politics , where it 's pretty much essential . 
  for a professor of politics he seems to lack any political tact . 
  that moron does n't speak for all of us . 
  for the record . 
  true . 
  i ca n't blame him though , i 'd put my family over my country . 
  [ i found this fascinating article about him . 
  ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/syrian-rebel-leader-seeks-europe-fleeing-govt-jihadis-163636165.html ) at the end of the article he 's talking about going back to syria to help fight for their freedom once he knows his family is safe . 
  so it * seems * like he left the army because he was afraid for his families safety by staying in syria . 
  it honestly makes me sad the kind of hardships these people are going though . 
  this guy helped take charge and organise big groups of migrants to make it easier on the overtaxed police force . 
   but if there are is fighters posing as asylum seekers , this man is not one of them . 
  in fact , for an asylum seeker , his identity is unusually well documented . 
  his name is laith al saleh , and last month he was the subject of a profile by the associated press news agency . 
  he says that he was a free syrian army commander , and that before the civil war he worked as a plasterer in his home city of aleppo . 
  so the facts about this guy are out there and apparently easy to get . 
  there 's no real excuse for ignorance at this level . 
  that does sound quite exciting . 
  have fun man !, 
  good for her . 
  she can do whatever the fuck she likes to do . 
  she 's kinda earned it . 
  nah dude , if you can afford a phone you can afford to live in conflict . 
  that 's just biology . 
   those are basically the unhcr definitions which is a part of the un . 
  `` the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees was established on december 14 , 1950 by the united nations general assembly . '', 
  - [ source ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c2.html ), 
  what 's an insult ? 
  you are acting ignorant by purposely not considering another viewpoint . 
  that 's what ignorance is . 
  and you called the vice chancellor stupid . 
  so if you actually look at the comments , you 're the person who started insulting people before anyone else did . 
  so that 's a really hypocritical thing to say . 
  honestly i wo n't be replying to you anymore . 
  because you seem to completely lack self-awareness and if you have no desire to explore other viewpoints or consider that your own may be flawed then we have nothing more to talk about . 
  at least you 're steadfast in your ignorance . 
  or maybe the person who is * vice chancellor * is right and your opinion happens to be the one shared with a chimpanzee . 
  ever consider that maybe you 're in the wrong ? 
  i guarantee a lot of the people spewing shit like the guy above are n't even german and have no idea what 's going on in germany . 
   germany is just spewing bullshit at this point so in what way are you more of an expert than the german vice chancellor ? 
  what credentials do you have ? 
  i swear all these news articles are trying to jinx her into dying or some shit . 
  15 % of the people surveyed think `` there are no positive effects from immigration '' that has kind of surprised me . 
  so people are n't * against * immigration , they think the rate is too high ? 
  that 's different to what that guy is suggesting in his comment . 
  regardless , thank you for the information . 
   but almost the entire populace is against it . 
  you ca n't say something like that and not provide a source . 
   that a lot of their children would n't turn into total nutjobs as we 've seen in france and the uk . 
  as interesting as that is , it 's not evidence for the above statement . 
   i 'm sorry there is n't an official poll for everything but maybe if you read a bit more coming from the guy calling for evidence , that 's pretty fucking rich . 
  i 've written a few comments here that i was absolutely certain could n't be misconstrued . 
  i was wrong . 
  you 'd be surprised what someone can latch onto to get the wrong idea . 
  some people just like conflict . 
   but i really do try to keep a critical mindset instead of being sucked in by ideology . 
  i 'm glad you do . 
  it 's an attitude everyone should have . 
  it 's far too easy to get sucked into things based on emotion , or faith , or ideology , like you said .
