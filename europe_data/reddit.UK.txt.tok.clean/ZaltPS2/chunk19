  because we 're a powerful country , simply . 
  in fact a lot of population projections place us second only to russia in the not too distant future and therefore we may end up being the richest country in europe . 
  not only that but we have either the first or second strongest military within the eu depending on who you are arguing with which has become more relevant with the ukrainian crisis and the syrian civil war, 
  i mean ... 43 years, 
  it simply had to be held before the end of 2017 . 
  cameron picked this date as he believes it is the most favourable date for the uk remaining in the eu . 
  one more condition europe . 
  let us win euro 2016 on french soil, 
  i 'm not sure thats all the governments of europe care about though , hence why we got this deal in the first place, 
  initially it seems like a lot of continentals in this thread want us to leave , therefore i will vote to remain out of spite . 
  i try to avoid / r/worldnews its like a cesspool of retardation which thinks the world is going to imminently end in a coming world war every other week . 
  that fucking title , another thing which misinforms those who just read the headlines about british politics ... its like the fucking porn filters all over again . 
  although sex education was honestly one of the most terrible and awkward lessons i 've ever had . 
  looks like estonia 's dream, 
  if we were forced to adopt the euro and schengen i would vote no without a second thought . 
  would i vote to join the eu if the uk had everything it had now ? 
  hard to say , i suppose i 'll be deciding that in the upcoming referendum, 
  damn that usd getting stronger makes it look like our wages didnt increase, 
  the oxford dictionary 's definition of terrorism is irrelevant ? 
  lol, 
   so either it was such a common idea among brits or qt set up the audience to portray one specific idea ? 
  which is it ? 
  i think the latter is the fairest presumption  have all the time , even recently i saw a brit on reddit say it . 
  british people loathe americans . 
  no , people loathe americans and some of those happen to be british . 
  the uk values the us as its best ally and people generally like americans and their pop culture , ask anyone on / r/europe from the uk , they 'll reaffirm that . 
   british people loathe americans . 
  go the the american hate subreddit and see who comments there , it 's nearly all brits . 
  if you 're referring to / r/shitamericanssay that is not a hate subreddit , in fact it openly bans people for being over the top . 
  that subreddit is about mocking stupid statements by americans . 
  furthermore , i do n't think you can infer what their nationalities are . 
   ... which other country had one of it 's most popular programs discussing how the us deserved 9/11 ? 
  did any others have a major paper saying the same thing ? . 
  question time is a show in which politicians and such are in a panel and are asked questions from the audience . 
  so it was entirely on the members of the audience that they blamed it on the us , the panelists probably did n't , and given that i 've never heard anyone say that the us deserved it personally , even when i 'm from a city famous for its high percentage of muslim residents whom would probably be the staunchest critics of us policy . 
   americans are often told how we deserved 9/11 and it 's always from jihadists or british people . 
  the comments following the boston bombings were even worse. , even on reddit we see this . 
  probably because we speak the same language . 
  the uk is far from the biggest vocal critic of us foreign policy . 
  [ if fact this poll shows that the uk views the us the least unfavorably comparably to canada and australia and out of italy , france , spain , poland and germany the uk is 4th in percentage people who view the us unfavorably . 
  ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/1-americas-global-image/ ), 
  so an unbalanced question time audience and an attack on the us foreign policy led by the guardian . 
  the latter is n't surprising but i ca n't remember anything from 2001 , i could n't even read properly yet, 
  like ? 
  very different though considering nobody in the region apart from china recognizes them, 
  small nations perhaps that ca n't protect themselves , but the likes of france and the uk ? 
  no , no they have n't . 
  the us spends more on healthcare then countries with welfare states . 
  are purely strategic bombers becoming irrelevant ? 
  it seems like the russian / american ones date back to the cold war and they 'd be incredibly vulnerable in any kind of conventional war, 
  you 're retarded if you think thats what the bbc is trying to portray . 
  it 'll just be some bombers flying close to uk airspace like they always fucking do you shill . 
  how has the us done that ? 
  you do realize most of the legislation that dictates surveillance and freedom of speech were made under a labour government ? 
  precedent 's in common law are used frequently in the defense, 
  [ police have arrested a 19-year-old man over an `` offensive '' tweet about the glasgow bin lorry crash that has killed six people .

   by the time war broke out the germans had increased the sophistication of the machine and the poles were struggling to make more headway . 
  but based on the polish knowledge , turing managed to build a huge computer that would finally crack the cipher . 
  so they cracked an easier to crack version of enigma and then turing , with the help of polish knowledge , cracked the war-time one ? 
  i agree completely, 
  i wonder how many people in the uk will vote to leave purely on the basis of eu members added from 2004 on wards even though the uk pushed hard for their entry . 
  stupidity has no limits, 
  this is going to be interesting , a lot of the pro brexit arguments are similar to those of the pro scottish independence campaign . 
  [ if anyone is interested in a debate about britain 's eu membership i 'd suggest this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyvat9io5ko ), 
   the letters given to trident submarines by some pm were such that they were not supposed to retaliate because mad had failed and it 's no use to help ending the human species . 
  have you got a source for that ? 
  i very much doubt its public information . 
  hindsight sure is powerful . 
  the alliances with poland were aimed at containing germany . 
  it was a deterrence and there was a reason for that , it 'll be difficult for you to find accounts of senior british and french military officials who believed they could somehow defeat germany in the west before poland capitulates in the east , irregardless of how many german troops were in the west much of the military doctrine and thinking came from the first world war just 21 years prior . 
  [ there is a thread here by askhistorians discussing the phoney war ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3hg003/early_in_the_second_world_war_why_didnt_the/ ) to summarize this , britain and france 's global positions were fragile , the 1930 's had been plagued by economic uncertainly and had spent the previous few years trying to rearm despite this . 
  british and french colonial possessions were threatened by an expansionism in both italy and japan so there was a very real threat that they could face a war with germany in europe , italy in the med / africa and japan in asia . 
  moreover , military doctrine since the first world war was focused on defensive warfare therefore why would the british and french attack the westwall when they could simply sit behind the maginot line . 
  the british and french did try to strengthen the containment of germany in the interwar period by seeking alliances with russia , however out of basic geographical barriers that was difficult , poland was n't exactly going to let russian troops pass through . 
  i do n't believe the british and french would have ever launched an attack on germany , they did n't make the alliance with poland for that purpose , the reason they had the alliance was to deter german expansionism , not fight it . 
  in conclusion , i believe it is understandable why the british and french did n't attack germany because in the context at the time it was seen as unfavourable . 
   we were sold in yalta what could the allies have done ? 
  the british did n't want poland under soviet influence but were powerless to stop it , they were n't going to go to war with russia after a devastating 6 year war with germany that had destroyed the economy and made the empire substantially weaker . 
  [ there is a reason it was called operation unthinkable ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/allied_army_positions_on_10_may_1945.png ) , the british were more fearful of a soviet invasion of western europe then fighting a war with poland , and rightly so , the soviet armies dwarfed those of the british and americans . 
  nuclear weapons have already failed if any of them get launched . 
  edit : looking back this program made me think actually , if a nuclear weapon was launched against your country , you knew it was inevitable that millions of your citizens were about to die , would you do the same to the aggressor , would you condone the deaths of millions on the basis that their government did the same to you ? 
  i honestly do n't know what i 'd do . 
  by the end of that i forgot it was portraying a war game . 
  i suppose how they portrayed it did n't help but i imagine that was more for entertainment value then anything . 
  this was an interesting read on the program http://www.globalresearch.ca/information-warfare-world-war-three-inside-the-war-room-making-sense-of-the-bbcs-pseudo-documentary/5507725 apparently rt suggested the program was to drum up support for trident renewal but given that they chose not to fire and the deterrence failed i doubt that was the bbc 's intentions .

  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/major?s=t  greater in size , extent , or importance : the eu certainly is  great , as in rank or importance : the eu certainly is , 22 members of the eu are part of nato . 
  [ nato themselves call the eu essential . 
  ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49217.htm )  of or relating to the majority : in many aspects the eu is the majority of nato depending on how you define that . 
   the function of nato is to use western europe as a tripwire to instigate a war between the u.s. and the soviet union . 
  well , its being nice speaking to you, 
  saying that the eu member states are not a major part of nato is idiocy . 
  you know what the function of nato is right ? 
  use different terminology and perhaps your point would be correct, 
  when did i ever say that . 
  i just said that the member states of eu are a major part of it , what ca n't you fathom about this are you retarded . 
  here , the definition of major since it seems so difficult for you  important , serious , or significant .
