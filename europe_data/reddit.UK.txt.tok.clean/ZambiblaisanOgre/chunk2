  and of course this sub upvotes it . 
  do you not know where you are ? 
  everyone on this sub knows more about foreign nations than the natives of said nation !, 
  but that 's different . 
  that 's promoting * diversity * . 
  we must accept cultural ` enrichment ' . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ / s , ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ case, 
  but no !, 
  that was the * correct type * of terrorism !, 
  do n't question it . 
  because this sub has the worst case of cognitive dissonance with schizophrenia ever . 
  do n't resist the anti-uk circle-jerk !, 
  well , thanks very much !, 
  more accurately , low youth turnout . 
  i think . 
  i hope he gets to find out . 
  what a cunt !, 
  great link , thanks !, 
  i 've never realized how drastically the range of the street car network in sf has shrunk compared to back in the 40 's . 
  the old photos are fascinating . 
  i like the sort of ` retro-futuristic ' designs ( if that 's a word ) of the vehicles from back then . 
  the city where i live used to have [ 90 miles of tramlines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liverpool_corporation_tramways ) . 
  of course they got rid of all that , [ as well as an overhead railway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liverpool_overhead_railway ) !, 
  to be fair , our city 's economy ( as well as the whole country , if i remember correctly ) was well and truly in the bog then ; no money to fix/maintain anything . 
  i see that they electrified our tramlines in a 5 year period though ; they would probably 20 years to do the same thing nowadays . 
  infrastructure management is so incompetent now . 
  shit like what happened in that first san francisco picture pisses me off so much . 
  i 'm not bloody surprised . 
  perfect sum-up of this country . 
  i 'd rather wipe my arse with nettles . 
   but this ~ ~ thread ~ ~ sub seems to be a `` hey guys look at how awful the uk is '' one , so i 'll be quiet . 
  indeed . 
  to be honest , i just have a more personal problem with the scum , being from liverpool and all ( kelvin mackenzie is the true omni-fucking-cunt here though ) ... tabloids are pretty much all cancer though . 
  especially ours . 
  fuck * the scum * . 
  good . 
  hope the scammers get the book thrown at them . 
   why in the world would any sane country want this kind of thing to happen ? 
  this is the thing : we 're not a sane country to have allowed this to happen . 
  depending on your social circle , to even question our immigration policy could get you a permanent label as * hitler mk.ii . 
  * i hope you guys wo n't experience this sort of drastic demographic change . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  that looks pretty cool . 
  unrelated ; is that motto from russell peters ? 
  apologies , i may have misremembered a few details . 
  it was actually a pledge to * not * support any raise in university fees from # 6000/year ( iirc ) to ~ # 9000/year . 
  liberal democrats leader at the time , nick clegg , was especially caught up in this , as he signed the pledge , and yet during the conservative-libdem coalition , his party then went on to sign plans that would allow universities to charge up to # 9000/year http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8123832/nick-clegg-admits-breaking-tuition-fees-pledge.html https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/19/nick-clegg-apologies-tuition-fees-pledge/ hopefully someone else with more experience might be able to provide further insight on this . 
  that 's actually the most accurate reason . 
  after all , this did get onto / r/all . 
  unfortunately not really . 
  people seem to forget that more than two parties exist to vote for , but our fptp voting system is largely to blame for that . 
  also , many young people still have n't forgiven ( and will never ) libdems for the free university fiasco few years back , and would never vote libdem again ... 
  lovely photos . 
  the netherlands has really nice looking city and town centres . 
  agree with the content of the video . 
  on an unrelated note , it really pisses me off that people comment underneath , saying things along the lines of : `` just because you recognize this is completely wrong , it does n't mean you love hiter '' , - * fair enough ; i agree * - then you scroll down to see some deranged cunt replying to the ** very same comment which denounces hitler ** , saying messed up shit such as `` all non-whites need to be exterminated . 
  '' , or `` 6 million jews alive is the worst thing '' [ sic ] . 
  what is wrong with these people ??? 
  these schizophrenic alt-righters just ca n't get their shit together . 
  it 's the same in every single alt-right related video : one minute it 's `` just because we believe white genocide is real , does n't mean we hate minorities '' , next minute , it 's `` we must lynch every sand-nigger we can !, 
  ( end quote ) . '', 
  ^ ( sorry about that . ), 
  there were reasons to vote leave other than to ` get rid of the [ insert nationality ] ' . 
  but this sub can be * very * left wing at times , especially when there has n't been a terror attack for a couple of weeks or so . 
  when things like this happen , that 's when things appear to shift to the right . 
  it just varies depending on current events , as well as the thread you 're viewing . 
  probably had one too many ... 
  i ca n't fathom the existence of people who lack intelligence to the point of actually having to search what the fucking eu is , after the fricking vote . 
  and , it lies northeast of the island of new britain ... you learn something everyday !, 
  wow , what a piece of shit . 
  surprised that the scum would have a girl from merseyside in it ... 
  the daily extremist ( express ) makes the daily fail feel like a respectable rag . 
  no problem . 
  and yes , it definitely is . 
  he 's quoting sadiq khan i think . 
  in an ironic way i assume . 
  not really ... 
  do n't worry , we 'll be joining you soon . 
  to be fair , the username checks out . 
  that 's what i do n't understand about many hard-righters . 
  they 've got unbelievably schizophrenic , volatile opinions . 
  it 's so irritating to watch . 
  total degeneracy . 
  ha , we definitely need them to get their shit together , that 's for sure !, 
  yeah . 
  i 've got no idea who to vote for in the ge . 
  there is n't actually a `` good '' choice . 
  just bad for different reasons . 
  sad , really . 
  politicians are a bunch lying two-faced twats anyway ... 
  i do n't trust them . 
  i , personally , would definitely want to stay as many parsecs from anything resembling an american healthcare system as humanly possible . 
  this applies to everyone i know as well . 
  i think that as a nation , we really take the nhs for granted , and it 's a total catastrophe that it 's even being considered to sell it off bit-by-bit to the profit-only private companies . 
  i was quite surprised by that statistic . 
  could n't make it up ... 
  the two terms are basically interchangeable on this sub . 
  we should now celebrate the transformation of the uk from a political entity and country , into a single individual !, 
  it has to be ... 
  it 's too ridiculous .
