  netanyahu denounces everything so we should n't take it personally . 
  just google ` netanyahu denounces ' and marvel for a bit . 
  has bibi denounced this yet ? 
  [ queen 's representative steps down after emails urging pakistani community to engage with the wider community were leaked . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/11/queens-representative-resigns-after-saying-british-pakistanis-need-to-learn-civility ) [ pakistani-born mp backs the queen 's representative 's message . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/14/mp-khalid-mahmood-backs-royal-aide-british-pakistanis ) and no , he did not get his job back . 
  i do n't know about the turks in the uk as honestly i do n't believe we have that many of them . 
  pakistanis , bangladeshis and somalis , all of whom are muslim , do not integrate . 
  he talks the talk but never ever walks the walk . 
   with 15 months before the presidential election , the sense of urgency is also political for the socialist leader , who has tied his decision to run for a second mandate to his ability to curb unemployment significantly this year . 
   since 2012 , when mr hollande came to power , more than 600,000 people have joined the ranks of the unemployed at a time when joblessness has decreased in most of the other large european economies . 
  says it all really . 
  this is just a ploy to get reelected and not a serious attempt at diminishing unemployment in france . 
  it 's not going to change . 
  the pakistani community in the uk segregates itself to such an extent that most of their marriages are incestuous . 
  this has led to a high rate of [ disabilities among their community ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/children/11723308/first-cousin-marriages-in-pakistani-communities-leading-to-appalling-disabilities-among-children.html ) yet they still do it . 
  human rights lawyers and the press would demonise any politician to put forward that idea . 
  how would you define smaller cities ? 
  places like hull , wolverhampton , telford , bradford , sheffield and peterborough could be considered smaller cities of the uk but they 're all largely decried as shitholes by most . 
  we saw it with the dutch somalis . 
  most of them were uneducated and could n't speak dutch but somehow obtained dutch citizenship and moved to the uk en-masse . 
  we 'd have to change the rules so it 's nigh impossible for refugees to get citizenship but that will never happen . 
  not a week goes by without bibi denouncing something . 
  afghanistan is begging for them to come back so i 'm sure they 'd accept repatriations . 
  he raped and tortured women of his own court , executed prisoners in gruesome ways , held most jews to ransom , lost a very large chunk of france and was a spineless coward . 
  he was comparable to joffrey . 
  the whole robin hood thing was largely exaggerated , but he did raise a lot of money from the poor to fund an unsuccessful military campaign he did n't have the guts to fight himself . 
  he was a shit king and a horrible human being . 
  seems fine to me though once you reach the age of 5/6 you should really be bathing alone . 
  as for the other comments with people walking around naked that 's not acceptable in my household , underwear at a minimum . 
  as for the toilet/shower thing , we have two separate rooms so yes we lock the doors when we 're showering or going to the toilet . 
  king john . 
  from plastic paddies in boston and other north east coast us cities . 
  even american presidents like clinton had a hand in it . 
  from the end of the world war until the 21st century the relationship between the us and the uk was pretty bad . 
  sinai ( americans screwed us over ) , viet nam ( we did n't go ) , falklands ( us did nothing ) and the us turned a blind eye to ira funding . 
  the middle east ( gulf war 1 ) brought us back together so all is well now . 
  there 's a safe area in iraq and a safe area in syria . 
  does n't give us grounds to decline them even when they travel through a dozen or more countries to get here . 
  french switzerland , preferably west lausanne or vevey . 
  good education , training for jobs , easy language , friendly people , little pollution , good transport and good wages . 
  canadian friend was here on her 24 month working visa as a teacher . 
  if she wanted to stay on she had to be sponsored by a school out of their own pocket so she had to leave . 
  a few weeks later the government complained that there are n't enough teachers here ... another good way to come to the uk is to sign up for a bogus college ( usually headed by a pakistani or indian national ) and just overstay . 
  when i was there i lived in melbourne in the suburbs , 1hour away from the cbd . 
  i do n't see how a pensioner can afford to live in the cbd . 
  it was all chinese or wealthy families there . 
  looking at rental property in say dandenong ( zone 2 ) you 'd have to pay about $ 300/week in rent ( jobseekers is $ 520/2 weeks ) so you 're stuffed . 
  however the government gives you 75 cents to the dollar if you 're renting as a pensioner or jobseeker , pushing the rent down to $ 342/fortnight a zone 1/2 daily ticket ( valid on all trains/trams/buses in the state metropolitan area ) is [ $ 3.90 ] ( http://ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/metropolitan-myki-fares-2016/ ) ( $ 2.50 / # 1.90 ) if unemployed/student/senior . 
  with regards to the attitude towards the unemployed , you can thank the media and the coalition for that . 
  suicide in korean culture is seen as an honourable way to save face and the dignity of your family . 
  that 's why when those ferries with all the kids sank pretty much all the people responsible committed suicide . 
  i do n't think that 's entirely correct . 
  i was unemployed for a little while in australia and i was receiving $ 520aud every 2 weeks from the government as a single jobseeker with no family to support . 
  this was the equivalent to about # 270 a fortnight . 
  i was given a [ healthcare card ] ( http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/centrelink/health-care-card ) which gave me concessions on public transport , medical bills , prescriptions and things like movie tickets . 
  i know that pensioners get a great deal of assistance from the government but with the wage disparity between states ( wa mining boom vs sa/nt income ... ) it would not surprise me that most pensioners have less than the median income . 
  they can come to wolverhampton !, 
  yes . 
  or they will find better ways to censor it . 
  wow ... 
  i really hoped this was just some sick , sick joke . 
  teary eyes in the household today . 
  rest in peace you legend . 
  a day of nothing but your music and a family re-watch of labyrinth is in order . 
  [ here 's one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7cov0_jtbs ) [ here 's another ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f7mvgtt9va ) edited to remove 3rd vid , thank you for the heads up . 
  people are having less kids across the world . 
  these are the un projections/figures from 1960-2090 . http://i.imgur.com/hjgbszv.gif, 
  turkey is now at/under replacement fertility rate . 
  algerians dropped from 7.1 to 2.4 fertility between 1979-2002 . 
  it really is n't any of their business and nobody cares about what the unhcr has to say unless it suits their agenda . 
  quranists are awesome . 
  why do most muslims follow hadith ? 
  hadith preaches so much hatred . 
  nobody would sign treaties with a union that breaks them . 
   we can do everything we like no , you ca n't . 
  the treaties that people signed when they signed into the eu would then be voided . 
  this article is from december , the riots happened in august of the same year . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/uk/datablog/interactive/2011/dec/06/england-riots-crimes-arrested  nearly 4,000 people were arrested for their involvement in the august riots - around half then found themselves in court . 
  interesting that in [ their list of available countries ] ( https://help.netflix.com/en/node/14164 ) they excluded syria , crimea , kosovo , northern cyprus , somaliland , transnistria , abkhazia , nagorno-karabakh , south ossetia , north korea and people 's republic of china . 
  yet they included macedonia ( as macedonia ) , western sahara & palestine . 
  nobody cares about this moron . 
  besides , men should n't have a say on these sort of things . 
  it comes into force on april 6th 2016 . 
  about half of those are from eea countries and are not subject to the # 35,000 rule . 
   net migration of eu citizens was 183,000 this is for immigrants from africa , asia & america mainly . 
  do n't conflate western europeans with our neo-liberal media . 
  when hungary stopped allowing everyone to just waltz right in and had the audacity of actually checking paperwork of migrants ( much to the dismay of the mainstream media ) hundreds of us , myself included , emailed our support to the hungarian embassy . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/hungary/11882507/hungarys-embassy-to-london-flooded-with-calls-from-britons-supporting-tough-stance-on-migrants.html i 've no problems with poland either , just wish their infrastructure projects were n't so wasteful but governments like that . 
  yup . 
  i was at the new years eve celebrations in fed square/flinders st station in australia for the 2014-2015 new years stuff and the amount of drunks and brawls was pretty bad . 
  i saw a man ( pakistani origin ) grope a woman 2 people in front of me and he got punched in the face by some bogan . 
  this sort of organised scale of attacks is n't the norm though . 
  maybe consult other countries next time . 
  looks good that they 've already started . 
  an estimated 9 years for the rail between riga & tallinn and 15 for the tunnel between helsinki and tallinn . 
  not bad considering the fact that the baltics joined the eu only 12 years ago . 
  that would be pretty cool . 
  tallinn and helsinki seem to be closer to the coast than london & paris are . 
  has there been any discussion on this from the eu regarding the 40 % funding ?
