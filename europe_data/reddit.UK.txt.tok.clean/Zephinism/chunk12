  i can understand that they do not want zus in corsica where authorities are attacked but it does n't justify attacking a place of worship and mob violence . 
  the way forward is giving people jobs and increasing security . 
  when youths are assaulting people in the streets they should be ousted and arrested . 
  we do n't need more racial and religious divide . 
  i do n't think it 's related to catholic values as italian women have a 1.1 fertility rate in italy . 
  as for the roma , who knows . 
  lithuanian and latvian women have a higher fertility rate in the uk than back home too . 
  polish women have more kids when living in the uk as they do back in poland . 
  in 2011 20,500 births were attributed to polish mothers . 
  http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/161201,polands-baby-boom-in-uk in 2011 romanian women in the uk had an average of 3 kids each according to government data : http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/fertility-analysis/childbearing-of-uk-and-non-uk-born-women-living-in-the-uk/2011-census-data/sty-mothers-country-of-birth.html http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/fig1_tcm77-351519.png the fertility rates for uk born citizens in 2011 was 1.84 and for foreign women in the uk it was 2.21 . 
  3 in 10 births were from mothers of other eu countries ( 55,000 births in 2011 ) . 
  eh , it does n't really matter . 
  russia educates both men and women . 
  russia has the biggest landmass of any country and could ( & should ) diversify to other exports besides oil . 
  saudi arabia educates only men . 
  saudi arabia is located in a mostly dry area with dwindling aquifers and a growing population . 
  all saudi arabia exports is oil . 
  russia will suffer until they diversify then they will be fine . 
  saudi arabia is screwed . 
  saudi arabia exports : http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/sau/all/show/2014/ russia exports : http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/all/show/2014/ austria exports ( diversified export example ) : http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/aut/all/show/2014/, 
  is it cruising back to turkey ? 
  why not take migrants from croatia instead ? 
  over 20 % unemployment and pretty close to you . 
  if anything we will move to being like india and not something like the united states . 
  there is no common language or religion among european nations ( esperanto is a joke ) . 
  you would have to get each nation to give up their foreign influence as each ` state ' does not need their own foreign ministers . 
  good luck getting past the british , french , spanish and portuguese on this one . 
  there is also the question of monarchies as in the uk we have the british royal family who are still considered crown monarchs of many non eu states ( canada , australia , etc. ), 
  other european countries also have their own monarchs . 
  we have overseas territories , with a piece of eu land already in the indian ocean ( mayotte ) and land in north africa ( melilla & ceuta ) . 
  migrants already force their way into these areas and claim asylum on ` eu ground ' . 
  what would restructuring nation states of the eu mean for british overseas territories ? 
  the falkland islands ( british beyond doubt ) lay off the coast of argentina . 
  would they be eligible to vote in the eu ? 
  it really is just london . 
  i visited family in wolverhampton ( west midlands ) and they recently bought a 3 bedroom house with a decent garden , garage etc for # 105k . 
  they make about # 60k/year before tax combined . 
  london prices are crazy but if you 're not rich you should simply move out . 
  the market will crash there eventually anyway . 
  this article was posted on thursday 20 february 2014 so why is cropping up again ? 
  there are 2 million less possible voters this year , what happened ? 
  2015 ( 97.65 % counted ) votantes 24.761.289 ( 73,22 % ) abstenci\u00f3n 9.058.088 ( 26,78 % ) 2011 votantes 24.666.441 ( 68,94 % ) abstenci\u00f3n 11.113.050 ( 31,06 % ) was there a voting reform ? 
  spains population looks to be about the same as 4 years ago . 
  why is it a bad day in slovakia when slovenia rejected it ? 
   the agency also found overall wealth inequality has increased since 2012 , mainly thanks to the soaring price of housing in the south-east of england and london . 
  once the housing market crashes again ( between now and 2018 likely ) they 'll lose a lot of that imaginary wealth . 
  remains to be seen if they can be refunded for this made up money by the british taxpayer when the crash happens . 
  honestly i do n't care anymore . 
  if journalists are not going to report the ** entire ** story then they deserve to get criticised . 
  the guardian did a piece on some kurds who were stuck in asylum centres in estonia as their stories were being checked out . 
  we were meant to feel sorry for them as they were separated and questioned . 
  that 's where the article ended . 
  what they did n't do is write a followup article where these people admitted they were n't kurds but just armenian economic migrants !, 
  when i have to read the daily heil and the torygraph because the grauniad wo n't publish the full story i can only say that i 'm sorely disappointed . 
  most german media only shows one side of the story and people are n't stupid especially when their anecdotal evidence and their issues are ignored by the press . 
  journalists have incredible power but if they omit facts and twist the narrative then they should expect a backlash . 
  it 's incredibly difficult to write an anti-immigration piece in germany i imagine . 
  cool , good job on completing the probe . 
  another one please , then another , and another . 
  clean up all the isil scum in turkish territory . 
  where are you from and where do you get off on insulting me crudely for my opinion ? 
  eu federalists asking for even more power for themselves and less for the member states . 
  they wo n't be content until we 're all ruled by brussels . 
  colour me surprised , who would 've seen this coming . 
  bunch of muppets ... 
  same and for the same reason . 
  lived there from 1998-2006 and regret ever leaving . 
  i 've heard the following more than once : dutch uncle , double dutch , it 's all greek to me , pardon my french , french shower and beware of greeks bearing gifts . 
  all in shropshire county england . 
  which part of the uk are you from roughly ? 
  it 's bizarre because this was filmed in france on november 26th when they had already enacted ` state of emergency ' . 
  they are in lockdown but there are thousands of foreign men walking on their highways attacking trucks . 
  [ here 's the video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=382njadcwve ) of the hungarian truck driver who swirved at migrants last month . 
  you can tell that he 's agitated as they swarm his truck and pelt him with things . 
  something needs to be done and they need to be deported . 
  i was n't joking . 
  i think something needs to be done and fast before the retired ( and therefore no longer active in the workforce ) percentage of people who can vote will simply block anything that does n't suit them becomes too large . 
  a portion of young adults in romania are emigrating for work purposes and may or may not have kids . 
  there are over 1 million romanians in italy for instance . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_diaspora https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanians_in_italy, 
  no need to worry about it . 
  for example , india will face extreme water shortages in the next 30 years and many of them will probably die . 
  should remove the right to vote at the retirement age benchmark . 
  we should get saudi arabia ( and qatar ) to stop . 
  whilst we can maybe enact legislation to stop this is half the first world countries , what about the rest ? 
  do we let them export fundamentalism to the third world ? 
  easier to stop 2 nations exporting than get 190 + nations to stop importing . 
  a y chromosome . 
  australia actually did something like this with their white australia immigration policy . 
  boatloads of italian economic migrants would arrive ( after a very long trip ) to sydney harbour and the australian immigration officials would quiz them on their dutch or french speaking skills . 
  many of them , being italians , could n't speak dutch nor french and were denied access to australia . 
  sometimes they would actually quiz them in english but only if they could be bothered . 
  italians were seen as inferior ( as were greeks/balkans ) and not really desired . 
  wikipedia link as i could n't find a youtube video where they explained just how discriminatory it was . 
  most would have moved last year i imagine and their claims wouldnt be included in this year . 
  uk accepts about 3000 pakistani asylum seekers a year , they 're out # 1 claimant nation . 
  shi'a and christians are persecuted in pakistan and there are frequent bomb attacks and attacks against minorities in pakistan . 
  they get benefit payments whilst they wait for their claims to be processed . 
  if you look at the colour of the bars above germany you see that it goes a lighter shade of red , thats the number of people who have applied for asylum more than once in that nation . 
  kosovo , albania , bosnia and serbia all have people who claim asylum , claim money , get deported , come back , claim asylum , claim money , get deported , etc.
