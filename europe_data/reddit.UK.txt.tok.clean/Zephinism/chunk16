  if somebody is not talking to you why does it matter to you which language they speak ? 
  it 's none of your business !, 
  i know there 's a fair few on this sub who really dislike hearing migrants speak their own language . 
  they hide behind lameduck excuses like `` they are n't integrating . '', 
  but really it 's none of your business why they 're talking a foreign language . 
  who is gon na stand up for a country torn in civil war with 2 governments and partial isis control ? 
  just call it a peacekeeping mission and call the special forces ` military advisors ' . 
  problem solved . 
  poles are # 2 most incarcerated in the uk now , behind natives of course . 
  most of them are in for theft or burglary though . 
  you just linked an article written by patrick kingsley . 
  the man helped smuggle people into sweden and has a youtube channel where he 's cutting the hungarian fence and pushing migrants into hungary . 
  naturally he will say that we should take more migrants and offer them our beds & homes since they deserve nothing less . 
  this is great !, 
  thank you very much . 
  the growth rates across all regions is impressive , bucharest is definitely increasing it 's lead . 
  is there a gdp per region of romania map that is accurate for 2015 ( or maybe even 2016 - wishful thinking ) ? 
  someone breaking laws in a perfectly safe country was killed by his own stupidity . 
  yeah , i really , really , really do not care . 
  let me guess , you 're a snp voter who voted for independence . 
  really , where ? 
  i 've not seen them . 
  all scores in / r/europe are hidden for 2 hours so that people do n't bandwagon up and downvote fresh comments . 
  it 's getting old . 
  i also wish they 'd crack down on people who submit large numbers of articles without adding any commentary . 
  where do your cherry tomatoes come from in poland ? 
  here in the uk they are mostly from morocco . 
  fixing your mistakes should n't earn you some sort of praise however . 
  anyway , [ the comment to stoke the flames ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/52vmkm/kosovo_spends_millions_of_euros_repairing_serbian/d7npx3e ) came from the op ( unless others were deleted that were posted before them . ), 
  you 'll find some people sympathise with serbia , some sympathise with albania/kosovo . 
  it 's mainly just passed off as balkan drama , what with slovenia and montenegro being the only ones without drama . 
  indonesia and china have the highest score for ` strength of economic ties with eu ' . 
  what does that mean ? 
  they rely on us or is it mutual ? 
  pakis take over ghettos . 
  poles spread out pretty well . 
  you 'd be better off investing in western kyrgyzstan ^ it 's ^ practically ^ uzbek ^ serious ^ reply ^ to ^ a ^ meme . 
  if they do n't pay taxes and employ at most a handful of employees so it looks like a ` head office ' how will that benefit us ? 
  i 'd rather our government claim the several billions in tax these corporations owe us . 
  the 7 year war was the first world war tbh since it involved multiple theaters ( america , asia and europe ), 
  jokes on you i 'm eligible for swiss citizenship . 
  they should make one for [ operation compass . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_compass ), 
  oh sorry , i didnt mean to imply that serbs conquered montenegro . 
  they pushed the ottomans out together . 
  i was under the impression that montenegro existed as a nation state briefly at the start of the xx century ( 1913-1918 ? ), 
  so i thought there would be some differences between them . 
  the part that i was trying to explain was that whilst people in the north would consider themselves serb not montenegrin ( in the census anyway ) that the territories were held by the state of montenegro following the expulsion of the ottomans by montenegrin and serbian forces in 1912 . 
  you have a solid comment history of shitposting . 
  why do n't you keep it to another subreddit ? 
  i read that at least for pljevlja that montenegrin and serbian forces took the area on the same day in 1912 and that it was ceded to montenegro in 1913 . 
  montenegro then joined with serbia , croatia and slovenia in 1918 . 
  montenegrin partisans also recaptured the area from the italians in wwii . 
  could just be ethnic serbs identifying as montenegrins . 
  if you know about the area you could correct me as i 'm pretty ignorant of serbian and montenegrin relations . 
  the regions were part of montenegro when they conquered them in 1913 from the ottoman empire . 
  they went into a union with serbia a few years later but the counties are still seen as ` montenegrin ' . 
  montenegro treats their serbian citizens decently and nobody wants to see more problems arise in the balkans so they kept them after the split . 
  edit : also it seems people move about a lot . 
  the north west area , plu\u017eine , was most against independence ( ~ 75 % of them ) . 
  in 1991 census the town of plu\u017eine itself was 91 % montenegrin , 6 % serb . 
  in the 2003 census it was 60 % serb 32 % montenegrin . 
  actually they marginally voted against it but they were outvoted by everyone else . 
  55.5 % voted for independence , the threshold to become independent was 55 % .

  honestly there 's a few people who seem to hate on each country ( except maybe baltics ) in / r/europe . 
  sweden 's ok , i went to stockholm for a weekend once so what do i really know about the place . 
  if you use res you can mark people so you know who to ignore . 
  haha , was that a reference to [ this ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/51jz8m/uk_immigration_minister_confirms_work_to_start_on/d7cnjjm ), 
  is this the part where we make wide sweeping generalisations about poland and polish people ? 
  around malmo . 
  i do n't understand the snp . 
  they push for referendums yet never accept the results . 
  at this point she is just wedging a bigger gap between scotland and the rest of the u.k. which might work out for her in the short-term is very damaging in the long-term . 
  scotland would n't cope independently anyway with the meagre oil revenue and naff all else going for the country . 
  high teenage pregnancy rates compared to the mainland . 
  honestly is there even that much to do on the jurassic coast ? 
  i lived at bridport for a while and would catch the x51 to get to dorchester & back and it was a jurassic coast ` tour ' bus . 
  mainly just takes you along the flood plains . 
  much better driving for another hour and going to bournemouth and salisbury/stonehenge imo . 
  weymouth is interesting for all of an hour edit : if anyone goes from down from weymouth to portland do not use the word ` rabbits ' as it 's a cursed word in portland . 
  use bunnies or bunny instead . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zdcls/iraqi_detained_in_vaasa_finland_on_suspicion/d6v4age really ? 
  though i suppose reddit and the real world do have some disparaging views . 
  the uk had to face growing problems in palestine and india and was a spent force by the end of wwii . 
  japan went down mainly through pressure from the usa and the ussr . 
  the ` end ' of wwii was also very messy with millions ( of mainly germans ) expulsed from their homes across eastern europe . 
  i do n't see how we could 've continued the war , or really why we should and how you would sell that to the public . 
  most people were fed up with war by that point . 
  they pester everyone to convert to christianity . 
  they should allow fgm if the father of the child agrees to have his dick cut off as well . 
  stops them reproducing and they get to partake . 
  oh if that 's the case then let us pay less tax . 
  cigarettes are expensive as it is due to taxes . 
   `` those who do not have the right to stay have to be repatriated . '', 
  lol ... no they wo n't be . 
  i doubt it . 
  we simply needed more time to prepare for war .
