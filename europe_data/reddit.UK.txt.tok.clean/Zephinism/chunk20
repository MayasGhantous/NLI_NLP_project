   `` the fact that spain impedes the free movement of nato forces between gibraltar and spain is to the detriment of western security , for example not allowing us naval ships to bunker in gibraltar and then dock at spanish ports . '', 
   they also argue the spanish governments decision not to give permission for royal air force aircraft to overfly spanish airspace on their way to and from gibraltar adds an estimated cost to each flight of # 5,000 to # 10,000 . 
   `` the spanish government allows the refueling of russian warships in the spanish enclave of ceutra at a time when russia has invaded the ukraine and is aggressively testing natos reactions . '', 
  this is all so childish . 
  spain is in nato yet obstructs nato members but gives russia a free pass . 
  the irish who left ireland for the usa mainly supported the ira and terror activities during the troubles . 
  the russians in germany support putin . 
  the turks in the netherlands support erdogan . 
  there will always be some who cling to heritage . 
  ford closed their factory in cork . 
  people living in cork still buy ford cars . 
  winchester - former ` capital ' of england , very rich in heritage . 
  the england of ` old ' . 
  stonehenge - not too far from winchester , you just have to see stonehenge . 
  i know it 's the typical touristy thing , but i found it breathtaking the first time i went there . 
  portmeirion ( wales ) - absolutely idyllic . 
  best way to get here is by train so you can also take in the sights of the welsh countryside . 
  take the steam train from blaenau ffestiniog and get off at minffordd . 
  it 's not a long walk from there . 
  [ here 's a video of brick lane .

  i dunno , if you go north enough you might find some . 
  last time they polled the whole country they said they wanted to stay in the uk . 
  no , i do n't feel strongly about the irish getting their independence . 
  however collectiveindividual clearly has some sort of issue with us and this may be where it stems from . 
  just read through their recent posting history and it 's almost constantly about the uk , the british or the english and never in a positive manner . 
  i 'd struggle to find a british person who is constantly posting vitriol about ireland every single day on here . 
  like when they do the lineup mugshots of the latest ` asian ' grooming gangs in the papers here . 
  their faces seem very malleable . 
  macedonia seem pretty chill to me . 
  corrupt as all hell but who in the region is n't ? 
  did n't stop romania and bulgaria from joining anyway . 
  i think the eu would actually work best in the balkans because it would allow for better infrastructure projects , schengen borders ( so no more albanian/serbian/bulgarian invasion crap ) and it would help macedonia do business if people can trust it adheres to eu standards . 
  this explains so many of your posts . 
  luxembourg is outspending russia on the first map ... 
  global warming , al qaeda , taliban , rise in homophobia , communism , tumblr and drunk driving . 
  this is just anecdotal but , i know an iraqi man who attempted to claim asylum in belgium and who was refused . 
  they gave him 6 months before he would be deported to south iraq . 
  he left after close to 5 months and went to claim asylum in the netherlands . 
  they took a little while to process his claim there and eventually sent him back to belgium where his 6 months before deportation was renewed . 
  again , as the 6 month mark approached he went to finland and was there for 3 months before they sent him back to belgium . 
  last i heard from him he was going to try france next . 
  i 'm of the opinion that failed asylum seekers should be incarcerated but i suppose that would violating their human rights to go where theyre not welcome . 
  better to be a bunch of nations who work together imo . 
  this is exactly what the ` leave ' campaign were saying when they said we 'd suffer a rating drop . 
  they also said we had enough of listening to experts . 
  they were wrong about 2008 , that does n't make their opinion something we should brush aside now . 
  who are you with ? 
  the local mosque in saint-etienne-du-rouvray was considered a ` home of radicalisation ' in 2014 . http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/actu/un-foyer-de-derive-radicale-en-normandie-24-11-2014-4316559.php the mosque had an imam in 2010 who had been sent there as other mosques deemed him ` too radical ' . 
  his contract with the mosque was renewed despite him having beaten his wife and gone to court . 
  no , the eu just ca n't ratify a ** new ** free visa treaty with france . 
  not that they need to of course . 
  eu pays them almost a billion euros a year to move towards starting their eu acquis chapters . 
  turkey should just be dropped and the money spent elsewhere . 
  almost anything is better than listening to farage . 
  a lot of people on these boards like to pretend they have even the tiniest idea of what goes on in the uk between england , wales and scotland . 
  most do n't and will get their fill from braveheart or some nationalistic tripe . 
  independence would be a serious , serious blow to scotland but [ freedooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ] ( http://www.monologuedb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/braveheart.jpg ), 
  the guardian newspaper announced a # 173 million loss for last year . 
  start to the week has been good so far !, 
  or maybe we 're just cool . 
   camus says that since marine took over the party from her father the front has made spectacular progress , increasing its electorate from some 20 per cent to about 30 per cent of the population . 
  how could the fn achieve this , he asks , when the bnp never had a chance in the uk ? 
  the first answer camus says is technology : the fn has conquered the internet . 
  in britain , trolling , twitter and alternative news sites are a leftist thing ; in france the fn has built and been echoed by its own alt-media . 
  websites like www.fdesouche.com -- a play on fran\u00e7ais de souche , or real , pure , frenchmen with roots -- pump out an alternative news agenda , with stories every day of migrant rapes and arab knifings . 
  it is among the most popular sites in france . 
  it would be so much harder for them to pump out daily stories of migrant rapes and arab knifings if they did n't actually happen on a daily basis . 
  they need to look at why people are turning to fn and not just dismiss them out of hand . 
   i stroll towards the mayor 's office : a hulking , stained-concrete building with the soviet-feel of provincial russia . 
  the mayor is the new front national . 
  fabien engelmann is a gay vegetarian and for eight years was a far-left activist with lutte ouvri\u00e8re . 
  `` but i defend christian civilisation . 
  i would not have voted for the front national of jean-marie le pen , because of his economic liberalism , obsession with the war and derogatory comments to a certain community . '' he worked in clothes shops and a factory . 
  `` i realised , '' he says , `` after a certain amount of time this internationalist utopia , lovely as it would be , is unrealistic . ''  the new front national mayor rejects the `` far-right '' label . 
  this is a media and elite smear to scare people away . 
  to prove it , engelmann says he opposes mass deportation of immigrants with french citizenship . 
  he says he supports a small level of immigration that assimilates itself . 
  he even has italian migrant roots himself . 
  it 's all about religion , he says , not race . 
   what made a gay leftist switch from the far left to the front ? 
  `` i realised , '' he announces , ** `` my error of interpretation on immigration and islamisation , which is a danger to liberty . '' ** it was seeing a veiled woman standing for parliament -- `` that was the click for me . '' that and -- `` all around us this rise of halal , this halalisation of france through its dishes , it 's a conquest of france through its dishes , if you look closely . '' the islamists will use the left to creep into power and it will not be pretty for atheists or gays . 
  i do n't blame him for switching . 
  i 'm an atheist as well and i know that whilst the right is traditionally the `` christian '' side of things they would not persecute me if i voted them into power . 
  not in europe at least . 
  as for the islamists ? 
  they hate the jews , they hate the gays , and they hate me . 
  it 's bad for everyone but big business . 
  * nobody left to pay pensions back in ee countries . 
  * labour missing in ee countries ( because wages are shit + lack of investment ) * money wasting on training people who migrate to ruk . 
  * increased housing prices for british citizens * increased waiting times for schools and hospitals for british citizens * strain on roads & public transport in the uk . 
  * insufficient space to grow enough food to feed the uk , in the uk . 
  switzerland which is trying to limit migration right now ? 
  cyprus which has seen a population increase of 170 ' 000 over 15 years . 
  germany whose population was actually declining until they pushed for more migration ? 
  austria who almost voted in the far right whose agenda was to limit migration ?
