  but if that is the case , then why on earth did the independent let them loose on a piece about someone who works in the fund management industry ? 
  i would hate to think that the independent did n't care about accuracy as long as the story was good . 
  that 's the worst kind of gutter journalism . 
   this is a simply enormous clanger . 
  no way is capital group a hedge fund . 
  it is a long-established and respected asset manager managing the retirement and other savings of thousands of ordinary people . 
   nor is this the only clanger in this piece . 
  the currency translation is wrong : currently , gbpusd is 1.33 , so $ 1.4 tn is # 1.05 tn , not # 1.5 tn . 
  i presume this is a typo , but really , independent , do n't you have any decent sub-editors ? 
   and it gets worse . 
  the article quotes a spokesperson from capital group , who described philip may 's job as `` client management '' and specifically denied that he was involved in investment :  philip is not involved with our investment research or portfolio management activities . 
   the spokesperson could hardly be clearer . 
  philip may manages people , not funds . 
   given this , what on earth was the purpose of describing capital group 's investments in some detail ? 
  are the authors suggesting that philip may should not work for a company which invests in companies his wife has criticized ? 
  or do they think theresa may knew about the investments but criticized the companies anyway ? 
  or perhaps they are alleging that she and her husband do not talk to each other ? 
  this comment suggests the latter :  it is not clear whether she was aware that her husband 's company was such a significant investor in the amazon and starbucks . 
   i am struggling to see what the point of all this is . 
  philip may is clearly not responsible for capital group 's investment choices . 
  and even if theresa may knew about the investments , she would still have the right to criticize the companies . 
  indeed , doing so would demonstrate integrity . 
  but underlying this is a deeper point . 
  the authors say that capital group indirectly benefits from the tax avoidance strategies of the companies in which it invests . 
  this is a fair criticism , and one that we might expect capital group to take on board . 
  theresa may 's comments could therefore be taken as pressure on asset managers such as capital group to take more interest in the behavior of the companies they own . 
  however , we should remember that as an asset manager , capital 's first duty is to its clients , and its investments are designed to deliver the returns that they expect . 
  investors may decide not to invest in certain companies for ethical reasons , and some asset managers specialize in ethical investment . 
  but in the absence of instructions from investors , there is no particular reason why a global asset manager should eschew the shares of amazon and starbucks simply because the wife of one of their senior executives does n't like their tax strategies -- even if she is about to become the prime minister of the uk . 
  her husband is a client relationship manager and doesnt actually deal with cash . 
  plus the ` tax avoiding companies ' are things like amazon and starbucks ...

  im from hampshire ( new forest area ) and would like to know how exactly we voted from village to village . 
  according to the national highway traffic safety administration ( part of the us department of transport ) 23-30 % of all train crashes are caused by rear-end crashes . 
  there was one in belgium last month though the train that was crashed into was carrying freight . 
  no , middle car . 
  if something crashed into the back of the train it would be bad news to be in the last car . 
  would n't rule out the netherlands . 
  i 'm sure they 'd hold a referendum or two on it . 
  they have half the gdp per capita of the poorest eu nation , they have widespread and significant corruption , a damaged industry and a fragile ` peace . ', 
  looks like a good way to piss your money into the wind at this stage . 
  danes , portuguese , maltese and cypriots kinda like us . 
   moreover , the report found that `` after quickly concluding that he was not a terrorist , '' agents decided to detain him on the grounds that `` they knew that he was ` bad ' . '', 
  sigh ... whoever did this should get shitcanned . 
  conservatives still have the most seats so they get to form government . 
  they can pick one of their mps to be pm . 
  if we are the exception , does that make us exceptional ? 
  it was a rough start ( russia v england v french ultras , germany v ukraine ) and i think the french riot police did a pretty shit job protecting fans , but this was only really a south france issue .

   if the eu is ever at war there would be serious pressure for ireland to provide aid and i have no doubt our politicians would happily succumb .

  everywhere outside of london has been shit on consistently since the end of wwii . 
  whilst the scots and northern irish can escape westminster rule , the north , the midlands , wales and the south west have no chance at all without something like this .

  can i get any sources for this ? 
  i looked into it and it 's averaged to 1 mile per 15 minutes so it 's actually a lot more than what i thought . 
  120 minutes in full gear ( gun included ) weighing 25kg . 
  if i remember correctly you have to run 2.4 km ( 1.5 miles ) in 10 min 30 secs or less for the test . 
  i assume it 's ~ 70 minutes for 8 mile run with kit . 
  did she really spark outrage with a tweet or did most people either not hear it , not care or just mumble afd and facepalm ? 
  half the posts in their recent history are from / r/unitedkingdom so i assumed they are from the uk .

  they are ranked 2nd for crime in the uk now behind only the brits themselves . 
  this allows many rags to print ` truthful ' hate against them , such as : [ we spend # 35million a year to lock up polish criminals ... because the jails there are full - daily mail ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1rbmjyf.png ) [ romanians eight times as likely to be jailed here as britons : shock new figures show they are worst offenders with 11,000 arrested each year ... as foreign nationals fill 1 in 8 uk prison places - daily mail ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fbhhhru.png ) [ eu migrants commit 500 crimes a week in uk - the telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8439117/eu-migrants-commit-500-crimes-a-week-in-uk.html ) [ the polish mafia is turning the uk into a hotbed of mob violence as scores of dangerous gangsters flood here - the sun ] ( https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/1060597/polands-top-10-criminals-on-the-run-in-uk/ ) [ immigrant crime soars with foreign prisoners rising - the express ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/378232/immigrant-crime-soars-with-foreign-prisoners-rising ) sure the independent and the guardian try their hardest to fight these headlines with facts but the sun ( piece of shit newspaper nobody should ever buy , jft96 ) has the most readership in the country .

  do you know anything about british politics ? 
  polls can show whatever the pollster wants them to show . 
  all depends on how the questions are asked and in what order .

  i voted to remain so i resent being labeled a brexiter . 
  the problem still remains that if people feel a job is taken almost exclusively by foreigners they will simply stop going for it . 
  it 's true for many industries in many countries . 
  our unemployment may be quite low but if the government measured things by underemployment there would be stark differences . 
  the uk government has allowed things such as zero hour contracts ( technically you 're employed but you never get work ) and apprenticeships where they can pay you 3.50 / hr instead of 7 .
