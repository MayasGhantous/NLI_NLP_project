  ( minimum wage ) people who worked trades such as construction , plumbing , electrician who used to make a lucrative amount of money now find themselves earning less as they are undercut by foreigners as well . 
  this is frustrating to people and whilst it is the free market it pushes people to get angry about migrants . 
  a few worrying increases there for guinea and the ivory coast especially , but migrants from nigeria , gambia , sudan and mali are also more numerous ... why ? 
  however the decrease in pakistani and iranian migrants is pleasing to see . 
  i 'd like to believe the iran deal helped with that but i 'm sure it 's mainly the fence between fyrom and greece . 
  [ well wayyyyyyy back when the black death struck england and killed off many people there was a worker shortage and employers found out they had to raise wages to incentivise people to come work for them and do jobs other people did n't want to do ( as pay wasnt worth the effort required ) . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statute_of_labourers_1351 ) when the minimum wage in bulgaria is 1 euro/hour compared to ~ 8 euro/hour for the uk there is going to be wage stagnation in the unskilled ( and often gruelling ) menial jobs . 
  british people left those areas since they became dominated by foreigners . 
  there 's an article i read a week ago about a farmer who used almost exclusively eastern european people to pick produce . 
  before the 2004 expansion of the eu these roles were usually filled by young british people ( school leavers ) but he had to pay them a little bit more . 
  without a minimum wage set across the eu less educated/skilled natives in richer eu countries will have to compete with swathes of workers from poorer countries . 
  but if we enforced a minimum wage upon all eu countries it would gut the poorer countries like bulgaria as they do n't have the infrastructure to compete with the richer ones . 
  native brits are n't lazy , they just are n't willing to work for a pittance or with large numbers of people who do n't speak their language . 
  this is also why some people on the left ( like corbyn ) wanted to leave the eu . 
  having foreigners who are not in a union and are willing to work for minimum wage affects their ability to raise minimum wage and pressure employers to do better by their employees . 
  they wouldnt do shit but tell you to avoid those areas . 
  we stole malta when nobody was looking, 
  the article in the op was written in mid may . 
  it 's a shame this map will become outdated soon as montenegro is poised to join nato this very month . 
  i did n't know that , thanks for the info . 
  thank the balkan fences . 
  i thought they would want london business moving to frankfurt . 
  yes it is . 
  [ cyprien video on being romanian in france ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdfl78d26u4 ), 
  go to marseille and you will find your racist foreigners . 
  france has it 's fair share of racism against romanians and co. too . 
  the term ` polish plumber ' was invented by the french . 
   standing outside an indian-run jewelry store with silver baubles arrayed in the window , kafil , who voted leave , recounted how his grandfather was the first member of his family to move to birmingham in 1964 . 
  when kafil arrived here , he struggled to master english while working at an indian restaurant , eventually becoming the chef . 
   `` we have lived here a long time , and we learned the british culture , '' kafil said . 
   in his grandfather 's time , south asian immigrants often were taunted with , `` go home , paki ! '' kafil was only slightly less derisive when he described the families from romania , bulgaria and other eastern european countries that have moved into his apartment building in the last five years . 
   `` they do n't know the law , '' kafil said , his wife nodding in agreement . 
  `` they are shouting at all hours . 
  they park their cars all over the place . 
  they are drinking and smoking . 
  they beg on the streets and pick things out of the dustbins . 
  it is a shame for britain . ''  m.g. 
  gala , a postal worker who lived off soho road a quarter of a century ago after emigrating from new delhi , voted remain to make it easier for his children to travel and work in mainland europe . 
   but gala , 51 , also acknowledged the arguments of leave voters who said the area had taken a turn for the worse . 
  as he left his car in a parking lot , he motioned toward two romanian women sitting on the sidewalk next to bags of recyclables , surreptitiously begging for change . 
  `` it was never like this before , '' gala said . 
  `` i do n't think britain is getting many qualified migrants . '' just sounds like a lot of people took their distaste of romanian and bulgarian gypsies out on the eu . 
   chapter 23 -- judiciary and fundamental rights was opened on 18 december 2013 . 
   the aim of this chapter is to create preconditions for an independent and impartial judiciary , with administrative capacities sufficient for the protection of the rule of law . 
   this chapter of the acquis covers the area of the judiciary , anti-corruption , fundamental rights , and rights of eu citizens . 
  in addition to the need for a full alignment of national legislation with the eu acquis , it is necessary that a candidate country shows visible and measurable results and track record in applying legislation . 
   the acquis in the area of anti-corruption is composed of a series of un and coe conventions , decisions , and recommendations by the european council . 
  the candidate country must fully align with the acquis and show readiness to make tangible results in the prevention of and fight against corruption . 
   the area of fundamental rights comprises a series of conventions , protocols , charters , and declarations , which the candidate country must introduce into its legal system , as well as ensure their implementation . 
   rights of eu citizens include the conditions necessary for ` enjoyment of rights ' of eu nationals . 
  these include voting rights and right to run for elections for the european parliament , right to vote and run for local elections , right of free migration , and diplomatic and consular protection . 
  most of the acquis in this area includes decisions and directives , which enter into force on the day of accession to the eu . 
  good luck serbia .

  things have slightly changed here but it 's just old people muttering things like ` polish scum ' under their breath . 
  not seen any attacks . 
  i think you exaggerate the strength of the republican movement in oz . 
  when the queen goes we 'll see . 
  that sounds pretty good tbh given the cost of living there . 
  are there any job prospects for someone with a degree in it and languages who can not speak a single word of romanian , in romania ? 
  technically we 're still in the eu so now 's the time to look at moving . 
  that 's not relevant . 
  it 's late enough to start drinking so i suppose i shall get to it . 
  i am really fucking disgusted by some friends who voted to leave based on immigration issues . 
  i am 24 . 
  i have lived outside the uk for 16 of those years , first as an immigrant in switzerland , then in australia . 
  i know what it feels like to be an immigrant and be scapegoated for the woes of the country . 
  friends from staffordshire , cheshire and wigan voted to leave over immigration because they believed immigrants were taking their jobs and their housing . 
  all 3 of them are unemployed , the staffordshire and cheshire one live with their parents and the wigan person is on housing benefits . 
  i have gone through 3 different jobs without any gcses or uk qualifications since arriving here . 
  no the jobs were n't always great . 
  the hours lousy and the pay frankly shite . 
  i 'm not a londoner and i 'm proud to be british but i am fed up of the people who blame everything on migrants . 
  i explained to them that we will likely get an eea style deal with eu migration but that we have just thrown away our vote at the eu parliament and they simply do not understand . 
  they do not see the eu as democratic . 
  i do n't believe any of them ever voted for an eu mep , ever . 
  i am bilingual , english & french and my job relies on me helping french speakers both here and on the continent . 
  what 's stopping them from relocating my job to the mainland instead now ? 
  both the tories and labour do not give a fuck about staffordshire , cheshire or wigan . 
  they will do the bare minimum to help cover the funding loss from the eu to these areas and i am positive that my friends will continue to blame the migrants , and the eu , for their problems which are just going to increase . 
  tabloids like the express , daily mail and sun need to be banned or heavily fined for printing obvious bullshit . 
  sign it anyway , https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215 let 's go , it 's at 2.2 million and growing . 
  i 've noticed a lot more people on the subreddit myself , though many without flair . 
  winchester , like in the old days !, 
  friend from wigan voted leave saying it would help her kids get houses ` when all the immigrants fuck off to their own countries . ', 
  i do n't understand them . 
  less jobs . 
  less high paid jobs . 
  currency crash . 
  price of petrol & shopping increase . 
  well i just lost money in savings and maybe my job as well . 
  can clearly see the old and the uneducated voted en-masse for this catastrophe .
