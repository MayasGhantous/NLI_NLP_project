   blogger anabel schunke argued that the site would do little to address the problematic attitudes towards women and sex found among many male migrants : `` these men know exactly what is and is n't allowed , and they just do not care because they have anyway never interested the laws and culture of this country , '' she wrote . 
  nailed it . 
  with a nice population decline . 
  ukraine had a garbage song . 
  australia or georgia should 've won . 
  she has that cute little angry italian headshake . 
  no idea why the song has an english name when she does n't sing a word of it but ` eh . 
  edit : oh , she started singing in english . 
  it 's being streamed live on youtube . 
  3 people tried to escape in a car and ran over 2 people , are those 2 included in the count ? 
   gunfire was heard at the scene .

   during the search operation at the cemetery , police reportedly found the body of a third victim , a law enforcement source told russian media . 
  they pestered me for weeks in a shopping mall in victoria , australia . 
  there 's a whole scam ring behind it .

  looks like they had fun . 
   `` but these are not the topics that generate public unease , '' he says . 
   `` rather it is the appearance of non-english names above the shop-fronts in the high street ; so pakistani/bangladeshi/afghan / polish stores ? 
   the odd decision to provide only halal meat in some schools to cater to pakistanis & bangladeshis  evidence of corruption in municipal politics dominated by one ethnic group or another . 
  as seen in tower hamlets by pakistanis and bangladeshis . 
   citing the examples of the rotherham and rochdale grooming scandals so pakistanis and bangladeshis, 
  i see slovenia as the gateway between the west and east europe , but i 'd have pegged it as western european ( if central was not an option ) . 
  we 'll never forget the amount of continentals who came and fought to protect our little rock and those who died fighting besides us . 
  my family is personally indebted to a polish squadron who saved 1 of my ancestors . 
  great work finding and mapping so many of them . 
  is slovenia east europe ? 
  and will trump win ? 
  as heritage ? 
  i read it was under protection . 
  unesco website only has 2 heritage sites for bosnia and herzegovina . 
  great news for bosnia and her people . 
  they should look at making it a unesco heritage site . 
  this growth for some of the poorer eu countries looks great . 
  cyprus is getting closer to parity for eu contributions ( some year they give a little more than they receive , and vice versa ) . 
  i wonder how long it will be for czechia , estonia and slovenia to follow and become net contributors too . 
  we 're not in the euro . 
  germany is by far the biggest and most powerful force in the eurozone which gives them sway over every other nation in the eu aside from us and denmark . 
  sweden , poland and co. ca n't put off joining the euro forever and i do n't see any of them , or france , stepping up to lead the monetary union . 
  politically , yes . 
  nobody cares about what either italy or the uk want in the eu despite the sizes of our countries and our economies . 
  france have strasbourg , and the germans dictate finance for the eurozone . 
  italy and the uk are some of the largest net contributors to the eu . 
  i guess the uk has some opt-outs so we 're not quite italian level of sidelined yet . 
  let 's be real . 
  germany will not let that happen . 
  france bickers amongst itself and since germany united in the 90s they have become the powerhouse of the eu . 
  the uk will be consigned to the sidelines like italy , we 're just fortunate enough to not have our money tied to the euro . 
  juncker is still a scumbag though . 
   that 's because they 're subjected to brainwashing indoctrination meant to instill an engineered sense of a `` british '' national identity . 
  whats wrong with feeling british ? 
  in a sense , more people in great britain feel welsh , scottish and english . 
  british is the next step for them . 
  think of it as being corsican , french then european or flemish , belgian then european . 
   the reality is that british people still think they 're special , desperately clinging to the remains of their empire . 
  thanks for letting me know , i was n't sure what i was meant to be thinking this morning . 
  i 'm from ringwood shown on the bottom left corner of your screenshot and there are protests against any idea of building in the greenbelt nearby . 
  still , there are 800 houses with approved building permission in totton and another 2000 ( total ) in the new forest area .
