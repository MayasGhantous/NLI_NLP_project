  sounds like germany . 
  only took them 11 years to see the light with youtube . 
  i dont know , they certainly like the french less & less according to that . 
  what it comes down to is this . 
  if someone is intercepted at the border without valid identification they should be held until either * a ) they put forward a claim for asylum * b ) they can be safely deported as they are an illegal immigrant . 
  if they claim asylum they should then be moved to an asylum centre where they will stay until their asylum claim is processed . 
  if they are successful in their claim for asylum they are now a refugee and should be given temporary shelter and assistance from the government . 
  if they are not successful they should be held in another centre until they can be safely deported . 
  once they make a claim for asylum their fingerprints should be taken and their identity added to an eu/eec database . 
  this database should be accessible to local authorities in all 28 eu memberstates , as well as andorra , monaco , san marino , switzerland , norway and iceland . 
  countries who do n't take back their illegal migrants should be charged the average annual salary per migrant either through taxes on things or in aid loss . 
  areas in great britain over 20 % seem to be cities or big towns . 
  from south to north brighton , london , bristol , cardiff ( wales ) , swansea ( wales ) , coventry , birmingham , wolverhampton , leicester , nottingham , derby , sheffield , wigan , manchester , liverpool , hull , middlesborough , darlington , sunderland , newcastle upon tyne , kilmarnock ( scotland ) , hamilton ( scotland ) , glasgow ( scotland ) , paisley ( scotland ) and dundee ( scotland ) . 
  i noticed southampton , bournemouth , plymouth , exeter , oxford , cambridge , norwich , york , edinburgh ( scotland ) and aberdeen ( scotland ) fared well in comparison . 
  it seems to point towards wealth but i do n't know enough about the cities . 
  if spain did invade ( this is hypotheticals ) first it would violate nato treaties . 
  spain does not meet the 2 % spending , and spain let russia refuel ships at their city of ceuta under guise that it 's `` technically not protected by nato '' . 
  meanwhile the uk has twice as big a force , the oldest military alliance in the world with portugal and a deeply intertwined military alliance with france . 
  nuclear weapons or no , spain would get kerbstomped by the uk in a regular war . 
  twins , triplets , quadruplets and its over their fertile life not per year . 
  buy the real estate , knock it down and make a fishfarm , timber farm or a crop farm out of it . 
  gives the last few people in the area a job as well . 
  yup , in 5 years they lose their majority due to natural deaths . 
  yes, 
  i see , i had no idea that was the case . 
  it 's just difficult to break the habit when i speak it , though i strangely never type ` the ukraine ' . 
  thanks !, 
  they won eurovision 2016 . 
  very good with it , my ukrainian guildmate codes and manages our guild website in exchange for us paying his game subscription . 
  homophobic culture . 
  any discussion about ukraine from 1918-1950 will end in an argument . 
  their very fertile soil is sought after worldwide . 
  i believe it 's called black earth . 
  lots of ukrainian descent people in essex , lancashire and dorset . 
  almost 2 thirds identify as ` not religious ' . 
  the country is depopulating due to terrible fertility rates and migration to russia , poland , czech republic and slovakia . 
  i keep placing the word ` the ' infront of their name but i do n't know why . 
  i helped , they were botting like crazy but their scripts werent enough !, 
  but they keep choosing the wrong option . 
   the report defines `` inactive '' as not achieving the government guidelines for physical activity of 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity a week and strength activities on at least two days a week . 
  well i dont meet these guidelines so im one of those 20m + people . 
  so i decided to dig a little into the poorest region of bulgaria , severozapaden . 
  in 2008 , 898,371 people lived in this nuts2 region of bulgaria ( on paper anyway ) . 
  by january 1st 2016 that figure had dropped to 783,909 . 
  12.75 % drop in number of inhabitants .

  we could do the text underneath the flag instead . 
  http://i.imgur.com/8tqvua8.png i helped for a couple of hours , gg ladies and gentlemen !, 
  thank you !, 
  thank you !, 
  [ not sure how to add one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/62oaq5/party_parrot_thread/#youtubeparrot ) edit : [ ] ( #youtubeparrot ) [ ] ( #youtubeparrot ) [ ] ( #youtubeparrot ) [ ] ( #youtubeparrot ) thank you kind souls . 
  i dont know about that . 
  even the falklands which is far , far away from the uk and next to argentina would rather be british than argentine . 
  if they isolate the rock as happened in 1969 i think it would just stimulate the typical british island mentality . 
  scotland is most at risk for leaving the uk in my opinion . 
  yes i know that but people do polls to gauge numbers or you can read about it . 
  i found a few things on it such as [ gibraltar puts a brave face on brexit - financial times ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/eb36b958-e878-11e6-967b-c88452263daf ) and [ as brexit tremors ripple , the rock of gibraltar shudders by the washington post ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/as-brexit-tremors-ripple-the-rock-of-gibraltar-shudders/2017/01/14/f86c0b70-d764-11e6-a0e6-d502d6751bc8_story.html ) both reputable sources . 
  it seems to lean towards remaining in the uk but not exactly enjoying the situation . 
  nothing that i 've seen in the media anyway . 
  i 'll look to see if i can find a survey from a reputable source post-brexit . 
   if it was me i 'd vote to become spanish but it 's not up to you . 
  its up to the citizens of gibraltar . 
  they have continuously voted against this . 
  they 're british citizens and gibraltar has almost a complete self-government . 
  they rule themselves in most matters . 
  they are n't spaniards and they have made it clear time and time again that they do n't wish to be . 
  funny how we give oversea territories and scotland referendums to decide their fate yet spain does n't do the same for catalonia . 
  [ edit : the downvote less than a minute after my post is also nice . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_voting ) [ why bother ? 
   the draft guidelines drawn up by eu leaders state that the brexit deal will not apply to gibraltar without an `` agreement between the kingdom of spain and the uk '' . 
   the clause has taken british officials by surprise . 
  one told the telegraph it is `` absolutely unacceptable '' and gives spain too much power over the future of gibraltar . 
  pretty low move but i dont see the uk selling out the rock anytime soon . 
  about # 1200 . 
  not as much as in germany , but pretty expensive for pre-job costs . 
  they expect you to have your licence before you apply here , it 's a pain in the arse . 
  truck drivers is a big issue here too . 
  massive shortage of them in bournemouth , ringwood , downton , salisbury . 
  signs everywhere with pay starting at # 23k/yr and no takers . 
  how much is a hgv licence to drive a truck in germany ? 
  edit : ~ 27k $, 
  why ? 
  there have been a significant number of cases where someone has been put to death and proven innocent after their unjust execution . 
  by sentencing someone to life in prison they can be released if proven innocent later . 
  should 've let us take it and put it on display . 
  worked well for the greeks and egyptians !, 
  [ it 's a snp mp quote ] ( https://twitter.com/mhairiblack/status/844240118965829632 ), 
  great play by the snp since they want independence but they lost the last referendum by 10 % and their economic model relied solely on a diminishing natural ressource that has tanked in value so i 'd argue a win for them would actually be a loss for scotland . 
  so basically ` fuck the english ' . 
  nice . 
  i agree . 
  i 'd like to see eu politics more widely discussed at a national level so people would be encouraged to go out and vote . 
  i just do n't know how they could do that without having to pander to people with populists . 
  he 's a snake oil salesman , nothing more . 
   it 's indicative of how disconnected uk voters were to the eu , i mean if you elect someone like that to represent you with all the other big players you can not be paying attention . 
  let 's not kid ourselves , the uk isnt the only country in the eu where eu parliament election turnout numbers are significantly lower than national . 
  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/en/turnout.html http://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-elections-2014/news/it-s-official-last-eu-election-had-lowest-ever-turnout/, 
   it 's funny how only in this kind of threads you are allowed to say that such a thing as eastern and western europe exists . 
  nobody denies this is a thing ... 
  i mean it 's pretty visible in most maps showing differences between countries .
