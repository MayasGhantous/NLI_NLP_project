  honestly had no idea estonia had such a high gdp . 
  probably the same places as contrary to popular belief we can travel to many countries for 3 or 6 months . 
  we just wo n't be able to work there and steal your jobs and cause your house prices to rise . 
  i imagine the spanish will be pleased . 
  paywall , can you post the article in the comment section please ? 
   grab your eu flags does anyone here own any ? 
  americans probably . 
  they are culturally insensitive & pretty arrogant on the whole but some of the ignorance i come across is astounding . 
  conflating the uk for england or gb for england is idiotic . 
  and of course they 're all 1/8th scottish or irish and feel the need to let you know that loud and clear . 
  nobody from bali posting in here haha . 
  sofia is great but i do n't think many tourists goes to the countryside . 
  i would recommend it , it 's pretty cheap too . 
  norway and switzerland are on the continent of europe . 
  canada & us are to the west . 
  south korea and japan are to the far east . 
  australia and new zealand are on the opposite side of the planet . 
  find me a middle eastern , central asian or african nation that works as well as the eu or efta nations in europe . 
  vietnam ( cyprus , latvia ) and cuba for czech republic are pretty good too !,

   a romanian civil servant denigrated the idea of same-sex marriage , saying it 's `` bizarre ... maternal love is something else , even though in a relationship between two gay persons one is passive and the other is active . '' this argument is shit . 
  what if the woman dies during childbirth and the child is raised by the father alone ? 
  not gon na get any ` maternal love ' now are you ? 
  what if two gay women have a child ? 
  ** double maternal love !, 
  ** homophobes have the dumbest of arguments . 
  kinda seems like local news . 
  i 'd argue that having a country reach eu minimum standards would be a reward in itself . 
  as much as we ( brits especially ) moan and groan about the eu , it 's leaps and bounds better than anything to the east or south of the continent of europe . 
  not exactly a large sample size nor a proper sample of english society . 
   i do n't deny many of these have a non-swedish origin but i hardly think the cause is immigrants . 
  do you introduce yourself as a viennese to french people , to spanish , to swedes ? 
  maybe if you near live the border you 'd go so far but regions are rarely discussed outside of the country 's borders . 
  whenever it comes up in conversation where i live ( which is next to never ) it 's called macedonia . 
  people need to understand that outside of their country nobody gives a shit about what state/province/region they are from . 
  macedonia could change their name to new new england if they want . 
  you spend your time linking to posts about the armenian genocide , which are almost always brigaded by turks in denial . 
  why ? 
  why would you make a post like this when you yourself are a muslim living in europe ? 
  i could n't give a toss about the religion of people who legally move to europe but we 're going to apply the same rules for everyone and i am of the opinion that if you 're a legitimate refugee you should be taken from refugee camps be they in the middle east , south asia or africa . 
  just because i am against this criminal activity of illegal border crossing , people smuggling , & lawless behaviour it does n't mean i am a bigot . 
  yeah , it 's essentially phasing out the british vote . 
  over 1 million of the 23million people in australia hold british citizenship . 
  i 'm sure most can not vote . 
  lol , i can understand why they dislike ` pakis ' ( despite there being loads of them at places like clayton vic ) i think brits would object to lebanese australians coming along and having a repeat of cronulla . 
  brits ca n't vote in australia , i know that for a fact as i was unable to and voting is mandatory there . 
  other two , no idea . 
  this is great and hopefully ends up being in the works , possibly with ireland included too . 
  having moved to australia and back to the uk i now have to go through the whole visa process again to visit oz . 
  i know that kiwis can work in oz ( so nz-aus deal ) just as there 's the uk-ireland deal . 
  i am a little bit biased since my end goal is to work in montreal canada if i can but this seems good . 
   seventy per cent of australians were in favour of the idea with only one in ten opposed . 
   support was stronger among canadians ( 75 per cent ) , new zealanders ( 82 per cent ) and people under the age of 35 . 
   the policy proposal was least popular in britain , where 58 per cent of those surveyed backed it and one in five did not think it was a good idea . 
  i like belgian humour and french . 
  gignoles de l'info is probably my all time favourite foreign comedy . 
  [ that video with the norwegians pretending to be danish people who could n't understand each other was hilarious too . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ) ca n't name any german comics i like and honestly i do n't know any dutch . 
  link some ? 
  ukraine has some serious issues with blatantly powerhungry and corrupt officials . 
  they need to be held to account . 
  no more blaming russians or anyone else . 
  this is clearly an ongoing ukrainian issue the ukrainian people should resolve themselves . 
  president after president are corrupt and self-serving . 
  northern ireland 's gdp ppp per capita is $ 27.5 k to ireland 's $ 28.5 k gdp ppp per capita for their border , midland and western region . 
  south and east ireland has a gdp ppp per capita of $ 49.3 k the poorest area in the uk is wales at $ 26k gdp ppp per capita . 
  source oecd [ regions and cities  regional statistics  regional economy  regional gdp per capita ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/ ), 
  nope . 
  archbishop welby never takes sides in these sorts of things , rather pushes for further discourse . 
  to pass the time ? 
  i mean the airline that has expanded cheap flights to many third world countries flying them from wherever straight to turkey . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/11874964/eu-border-force-blames-turkish-airlines-for-surge-in-illegal-african-migration.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/11793416/turkish-online-visas-providing-easy-back-door-into-europe.html your country gives 'em easy visas and cheap flights to your country then turns a blind eye when they depart from the shores by the thousands a day . 
  does n't really matter . 
  kurds can go to kurdistan , turks can stay in turkey and all the 3rd world turkey 's national airline has decided to do flights to can stay in turkey too . 
  this coming from someone whose country only joined the eu in 2013 . 
  that would also imply 27 countries working together in unison . 
  hahaha . 
  can you do one for viet nam & usa during the viet nam war ? 
  thanks . 
  torn between ireland and france . 
  england once occupied a significant amount of france , the last people to invade england were french ( from normandy & bretagne ) . 
  we have similar cultures to those of northern france though i think marseille & nimes not so much . 
  ireland as we were together for hundreds of years until halfway through ww1 . 
  i have irish ancestry and so do most i talk to here . 
  we 're well intertwined already with near identical culture and we share a commonly spoken language & borders .
