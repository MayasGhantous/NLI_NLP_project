  on march 24th 1550 peace was declared between france , scotland and england . 
  the war was started by king henry viii of england who sought to marry his son edward vi with mary , queen of scots who was an infant at the time in order to unite england and scotland .

  probably more than half of british people here voted remain . 
  at least they 've been vocal about it but british users with union jack or england flags as their flags cop a fair amount of abuse . 
  we get negative stereotypes about just about anything and anything to do with northern ireland , scotland or brexit just devolves into `` fuck england / the english '' . 
  / r/europe has become a hostile place for the english users since late 2015 . 
  just look at the london terrorist attack thread that broke . 
  comment chains of insults and snarks towards us that were eventually removed . 
  about two thirds of my guild are moroccan so i ca n't say that i 'm surprised hhhhhh . 
  roubaix is an interesting place . 
  sadly much of it has fallen to the wayside since france began a transition to a postindustrial country . 
  also home to ankama studios who make one of my favourite games of all time , dofus !, 
  ( they also make wakfu . ), 
  i 'm not sure why there are quotation marks there . 
  it was in both the uks and czechs interest to rebuild their agency as the czech republic emerged as a democratic central european state . 
  the czechs have been looking after their spy affairs for at least 20 years and maybe this is biased but i prefer it to have been trained by our agencies than the russians . 
  the general populace may have voted brexit but our government is n't actively funding nationalist movements across europe . 
  probably yes . 
  would n't surprise me if a lot were in that case there as some of the best schools in ireland look more favourably upon catholics than atheists . 
  this seems pretty good for poland . 
  on average a polish woman had one child extra living in the uk than in poland . 
  once migration from ukraine to poland dries up ( it has to at some point ) then poland will need stable population to keep up . 
  things seem to be going well for poland though . 
  rising gdp , rising living standards , falling unemployment , infrastructure booming across the country . 
  completed avoided the 2008 crash . 
  stupid laws see many , many polish people on the streets so the polish people wo n't take shit lying down . 
  poland meets their nato requirements biggest issues i see for poland is the low investment into r&d and and low renewable energy drive . 
  most non-eu migrants are students, 
  i like your train of thought . 
  what the hell ? 
  right after ww1 the british were helping the white russians and latvians fight the red russians . 
  then we had lithuania and poland at each others throats through the 20s and 30s , spain embroiled in civil war etc.

  let 's form a rebel alliance fellas !, 
  sucks we ca n't include denmark or portugal in it though , they can be our informants . 
  alabama , mississippi , louisiana , kentucky , georgia , south carolina and west virginia are all pretty shitty states to be quite frank .

  outside of tokyo a lot of japanese houses are demolished [ every 30-40 years .

  28 of the 51 countries of europe are in the eu . 
  as for the usa being called america that annoys me too but i 've given up on it . 
  if they want to join the border force and turn them away at the border , fine . 
  but this ...  one group jogged off into a thicket of beech trees while another watched an instructor demonstrate , with a 6-inch hunting knife , the proper technique for stabbing an assailant in the chest and throat . 
  this is not on , especially for an eu member . 
   `` i hope that geert wilders does n't win , and the dutch want to stay in europe . 
  i also wish the same for france , '' said another man . 
  i know this is probably petty , but i wish people would know the difference between the eu and europe .

  yeah i agree if it returns a no vote we should wait until 2022-2023 to have another one . 
  maybe 2028 after that just to give things time to cool down and possibly in the 2030s too when the eu starts accepting the remaining balkan nations .

  they dont value showing up to vote , so i dont worry about them . 
  probably , we just need a generation to die . 
  if they do get one , every single penny for it needs to come from scottish coffers . 
   probably 60 % of refugees support having the death penalty for non-muslims `` probably '' where did you pull these stats from ?

  nothing turkey or euphrates can really do about it . 
  they took long enough just to capture albab . 
  without the dup ( democratic union party ) holding an absolute majority , same-sex marriage can finally be legalised in the last part of the uk . 
  i think this is pretty good . 
  but people are blowing it out of proportion . 
  dup is headed by a corrupt crook and uup shot itself in the foot by saying they 'd back sdlp . 
  desire to cede from the uk is still weak and just wishful thinking from nationalists . 
  japan has yakuza and shady redlight district deals . 
  [ at the end of 2016 , 81 journalists were jailed in turkey .

  there were 259 journalists imprisoned worldwide with turkey having twice as many as the next country ( china , 38 ), 
   migrants who are refused entry to the eu and dispute the decision should be detained to prevent them staying illegally . 
  its not about those resettled across eastern european countries as they are already processed and deemed to be worthy of asylum . 
  this is about those who are refused asylum , contest it and just walk to another schengen country or go underground . 
  anyone refused asylum should be locked up ( according to the commission ) . 
   it 's not a call for blanket detention , said a commission official , but a way to make full use of european legislation which allows irregular migrants to be detained for six months , and in some cases for 18 months . 
  the official added that the move is to stop migrants disappearing while their claim is being processed . 
  poland and cyprus i can understand , but romania , bulgaria and croatia are n't even in schengen . 
  eu should let bulgaria and romania join the eu since they meet all the standards to join . 
  for croatia i 'm unaware of their situation with the schengen regulation . 
  labour are such a terrible opposition party . 
  no unity , no backbone and no voice . 
  over 60 % of those who voted at the ge in 2015 did n't vote tory yet whatever the tories want they seem to get .
