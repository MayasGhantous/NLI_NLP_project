  you misunderstand . 
  if you give people the opportunity to legally work in countries with better wages & lower unemployment it can help them avoid the poverty trap and steer them away from petty crime . 
  the downsides are depopulation and brain drain but these can be countered by governments investing in r&d possibly with the help of the eu and an improving infrastructure and economic situation at home . 
  also there 's no need to downvote every time i comment , you can just argue your case and hold the discussion with me instead . 
  if people can move where they want then there will be less of a problem with minority rights in the balkans . 
  bosnian serbs & croats , serbs in northern kosovo and minorities in montenegro could just move to places with the same currency and languages as each other . 
  yes depopulation helps as it gets people into work and turns them away from petty crime and unemployment in their countries even if they work in another country for a certain amount of time . 
  think of it like how moldovans benefit from romania being in the eu . 
  yeah but that was back when people were restricted to living in the balkans . 
  when the entire balkans is in the eu for ~ 7 years , people will be able to move to all the other eu states and there will be funding for balkan infrastructure . 
  like this http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/west-balkan-six-concludes-in-pristina-eu-pledges-infrastructure-funds and http://www.gtreview.com/news/europe/eu-institutions-to-support-western-balkans-infrastructure-development/ though there were immediate migration controls enacted on romania , bulgaria and croatia when they joined , [ this is poland 12 years on from eu accession . 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/eiqontbviu8y.jpg ) the combined population of the non-eu balkan states is less than that of romania and maybe i 'm a wishful thinker in believing that when they join the eu and have free movement to norway , switzerland , sweden & germany that tensions will subside and people will just move to where they can work . 
  may i direct your attention to the ` reactions ' part of the page you linked me ? 
   but islamic pakistanis can do no wrong err , what ? 
   in the last two quarters of 2016 , more than 800 eu citizens had their permanent residency requests refused with a further 5,500 declared invalid , a rejection rate of around 28 % , analysis by the liberal democrats found . 
  to qualify , eu nationals need five years of continued residence in the uk . 
   a home office spokesperson said the refusal rates included applications that were invalid because of errors or unpaid fees and said that meant it would be `` wrong to draw conclusions '' about the reasons for the rejections . 
   `` eea nationals are not required to apply to the home office for documentation confirming their status or their right to be here and these rights remain unchanged while we are a member of the european union . ''  the house of lords is likely to back amendments to the article 50 bill this week that would guarantee rights to eu citizens , with support from labour , liberal democrat and crossbench peers . 
  more than 80 peers across the parties voiced concern for the rights of eu nationals over the course of the two-day debate at the bill 's second reading in the lords . 
  the important parts basically . 
  the rest is gibberish about calais and davis spouting off in estonia . 
  i do n't know if serbia really has that much unfinished business anymore . 
  they are sending people to the hague to be tried and will attempt to work things out with croatia . 
  their relations with albania and bosnia do not matter ( as they are further along the path to eu membership than these nations ) . 
  the biggest roadblock for serbia is kosovo . 
  if serbia recognises kosovo as independent , the eu nations who do not recognise kosovo will recognise it as well . 
  obviously corruption is an issue but that did n't stop hungary , bulgaria or italy from joining . 
  here you are complaining in the [ uk subreddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/56g4uo/britains_view_of_its_history_dangerous_says/d8j4xej/?context=3 ) about being attacked and getting downvoted for ` criticising ' the british or the army and here is [ you saying / r/europe is a bunch of racist the_donald users ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56yygz/the_syrian_heroes_of_leipzig/d8nntsp/?context=3 ) yet you post [ this `` criticism '' of the armed forces ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/55yz8y/teresa_may_never_again_let_leftwing_human_rights/d8ew2qi/?context=3 ) and link a song glorifying a terrorist group . 
  add turkey and serbia to that list . 
  did n't know that they taught spanish in slovakia . 
  til . 
  yeah , we share a lot of similarities with france . 
  they 'd be amongst our closest european friends . 
  yeah , tens of thousands of unemployed americans and a massive loss of influence not to mention a logistical nightmare . 
  edit : oh actually , they are quite similar are n't they ? 
  the police are . 
  if a woman reports to have been raped over a week by a man , say twice a day ( she thought she would meet him off the internet for example ) that would be 14 counts of rape . 
  even if its not proven in court , or they could only prove 5 counts of it . 
  if you get with a woman , tell her before sex that you 'll wear a condom but you take it off at any point during sex ( or dont wear it at all ) that is rape . 
  if you have sex with your wife when she told you no , that is rape . 
  if you have sex with someone who is not of capacity to say yes or no ( drunk , drugged , unconcious ) that is rape . 
  hi im just curious if you know we can see your highest rated comment is a fox news submission to t_d subreddit ? 
  [ right here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/55ub25/high_school_student_in_critical_condition_with/ ) your fourth highest rated comment on reddit is also on this very same alt-right subreddit . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/4gn3ry/donald_j_trump_has_won_every_single_county_in_the/ ) anyway i 'm very saddened to hear that even * left-wingers * like you are getting upset about ` muslim migrants ' in an european country you 'll likely never visit . 
  can you link me to some sources for your stats please ? 
  `` i 'm concerned for the citizens of the country being assaulted by refugees . '', 
  that does n't happen though . 
  if cologne has shown us anything it 's illegal immigrants from the maghreb ( algeria , morocco & tunisia ) who commit the majority of these crimes as immigrants across the continent . 
  fyi you tried to disprove a t_d user , a futile endeavour really . 
  good counter article though . 
  the average american makes about the same as the average italian person , maybe slightly less . 
  they just have the most billionaires so it skews the numbers . 
  as if you actually talk to refugees lol . 
  have you ever even met one ? 
  most grenade attacks are between drug and gambling gangs from the christian nations of serbia , montenegro and bulgaria . 
  just like most gun deaths in the us are either suicides or hoodrats killing each other . 
  rape is prolific everywhere . 
  south africa is mostly christian , they have bad rape issues . 
  india with their hindus . 
  the japanese with the rape of nanking & women only train carriages ? 
  hell , even in my country the uk we 've found the clergy , the politicians and the wealthy tv folks abuse and rape children .

  the roundabout with two layers is something i see in the uk , but its geared towards walkers . 
  i wanted to see what happens if a long vehicle has to stop for a cyclist when exiting a roundabout . 
  would n't this hold up traffic on the roundabout ? 
  was it a pitbull ? 
  eh , i think the baltic nations would rather have england as a neighbour than russia . 
  is n't that belgium 's flag ? 
  thanks !, 
  looking at the picture i can sort of imagine where the lake would 've been , but the town itself looks completely planned and sort of artificial , especially the linear housing & the trees . 
  almere sounds like some spanish town name , not dutch . 
  what does it mean in dutch ? 
  how is this good ? 
   but so far , i have always thought about places like the uk was that really necessary ? 
  thanks mike !, 
  sorry to bug you , but could you tell me what the remain/leave vote for this area is ? 
  ( removed ) i dont see where the numbers are . 
  well it 's in everybody 's best interest to keep the border between ni and ireland open . 
  it would be damaging to both nations to have terrorism flare up again . 
  where i live ( new forest district , hampshire ) people had long carpet things sprawled out on their roof saying ` vote leave ' and there were ` take back control ! ', 
  signs everywhere . 
  the village i 'm in is pretty much entirely white british aside from the token indian family who run the pharmacy and indian takeaway , the 2 chinese families who run takeaways and the turkish run kebab shop . 
  i do n't recall seeing any remain signs at all . 
  the jihadists have run a lot of their ilk through the meatgrinder defending al bab & qabasin . 
  the russian strike that killed 3 turkish soldiers hit near ghuz to the south west of al bab where the saa has advanced to . 
  euphrates shield ( turkish backed ) and syrian arab army ( russian backed ) are clashing to the south & south west of al bab . 
  i read that the turks already said they wo n't go further than al bab when they previously wanted to go to al raqqah because the russian and syrian governments made a deal with them behind closed doors .

  the combined population of albania , bosnia & herzegovina , kosovo , fyrom , montenegro and serbia is only 18 million which is less than romania and half of that of ukraine or poland . 
  i do n't think we would really feel the ` shock ' of them joining , besides they need to meet the acquis goals first anyway . 
  how does this work ? 
  can i let my friends from across europe `` use '' my address to sign up for netflix and such ? 
  why ? 
  i 've not met anyone who dislikes serbs here . 
  i mean granted there are some who hate anyone who is n't english , scottish or welsh but those people are a minority . 
  most people would tick the ` do n't care ' box if asked . 
  long live her majesty !,
