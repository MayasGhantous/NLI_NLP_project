   the slovenian parliament on thursday endorsed the government-sponsored bill of amendments to the aliens act with restrictive regulations for potential migrants and asylum seekers , criticised by international nongovernmental organisations and the council of europe . 
   a total of 47 mps voted in favour of the new legislation and 18 voted against . 
  after the announcement in the national gazette , the law will enter into force . 
   the new legislation enables slovenian police to seal the country 's borders to illegal migrants for a limited period if needed . 
   the law is meant to prevent a repeat of a six-month-long flood of migrants across slovenia that ended in march 2016 , when several countries closed the main balkan migration route . 
   around 500,000 illegal migrants crossed slovenia , the smallest country along the migration corridor , on their way to desired destinations in the wealthier western european countries . 
   interior minister vesna gyorkos znidar said the law did not contravene the european legislation and international conventions which refer to refugees and not economic migrants . 
   turkey on friday filed a second extradition request with greece for eight soldiers who allegedly took part in a coup attempt last year , state-run anadolu news agency reported a day after the greek supreme court denied a previous demand for their handover . 
   meanwhile , turkish foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu cautioned he would move to cancel a bilateral readmission agreement between turkey and greece on irregular migration , according to state broadcaster trt . 
   that agreement , allowing migrants in greece who are not granted asylum to be returned to turkey , came into focus last year during talks between ankara and brussels on stemming migration flows from turkish soil to the european union . 
   `` we ca n't look positively on a country that backs terrorists , putschists and traitors . 
  greece should know that , '' said cavusoglu , according to trt , adding that turkey would take the `` necessary steps , '' including on the readmission agreement . 
   the greek judges accepted the views of the public prosecutor that the men could face an unfair trial or even torture if they were sent back to turkey . 
   an istanbul court quickly approved an arrest order issued by a prosecutor for the soldiers , shortly after the court in greece made its decision . 
   the two majors , four captains and two sergeants escaped from turkey by helicopter in july during an attempted coup . 
  they applied for asylum once they reached greece . 
   turkey blames the coup attempt on fethullah gulen , a us-based turkish preacher , and his followers . 
  gulen denies he orchestrated the failed putsch . 
   the anadolu report on the new extradition request did not indicate that grounds for it . 
   the state prosecution filed an indictment on friday charging momir , petar and mirko tasic with committing crimes against humanity in the visegrad area during wartime . 
   according to the charges , they participated in the forced disappearance of six bosniaks on june 16 , 1992 . 
   the accused men had previously arrested , tortured and abused their victims , the indictment says . 
   the six bosniak victims are still listed as missing . 
   the three suspects have also been charged with raping two people . 
   the indictment alleges that momir and petar tasic were members of the bosnian serb army servicemen , while mirko tasic worked at the public security station in visegrad . 
   the prosecution claims that the tasics committed the crimes as part of a widespread and systematic attack on the bosniak civilian population in the visegrad municipality . 
   it was not immediately clear whether the three men are related or not . 
   the indictment has been forwarded to the state court for confirmation . 
   estonian government on thursday approved the concluding of the rail baltic agreement and authorized prime minister juri ratas to sign it on the behalf of estonia . 
   compared to existing agreements , the accord to be concluded between the governments of estonia , latvia and lithuania will not bring new obligations to estonia , but it will give certainty that the project for the high-speed rail connection will not drag on , the government 's press service said . 
  the prime ministers of the three baltic states are to sign the agreement at the end of this month in tallinn . 
   `` rail baltic is a very important investment for the estonian state , which will support the development of our business , tourism and transport sectors , on the one hand , and on the other strongly connect us with central europe , '' prime minister juri ratas said through spokespeople . 
   the agreement to be signed by the prime minister next tuesday in tallinn reflects the agreements previously set out in joint declarations of the baltic heads of government and transport ministers as well as the provisions of the rail baltic financing agreement concluded between the joint venture rb rail , the three baltic countries and the european commission . 
   the agreement is important in that it will give greater force to what has already been done , the government said -- it will be signed by prime ministers and ratified in national parliaments , which means it will stand also in the event of a possible change of government . 
   the rail baltic agreement determines the general technical parameters and route of the railroad as well as the construction timetable . 
  an intergovernmental agreement is necessary because there are some matters which companies can not regulate under the rail baltic joint venture shareholders ' agreement , the government 's press service said . 
   the accord regulates ownership of the future rail infrastructure and the land under it , as well as the conditions of financing the construction . 
  it also provides for ensuring access to the rail baltic infrastructure and gives general guidelines for the rail baltic management to determine the infrastructure operator . 
   the total cost of the works on the estonian territory is projected at 1.3 billion euros of which estonia 's contribution is 250 million euros . 
  up to 85 percent of the rail baltic project funding will come from the connecting europe facility . 
   both lithuania and latvia have already approved the rail baltic agreement at the government level and authorized their heads of government to sign it . 
  rail baltic agreement not to be put before lawmakers before april  the estonian government will not send the rail baltic agreement to the parliament for ratification before the completion of the rail baltic feasibility study in april , prime minister juri ratas said after the estonian government had given its nod to the agreement on thursday . 
   `` we will not send this agreement to the riigikogu automatically for ratification , but will wait until the conclusive feasibility study is completed , '' ratas said at the government press conference , adding that the feasibility study covering all the three countries will be ready in april . 
   `` it is based on that study that the government must make a decision about sending it to the riigikogu for ratification , '' he said . 
  `` the feasibility study carries great weight and it has to be discussed by the government once again then , '' ratas , chairman of the center party , said . 
   ratas declined to answer when asked whether the government could abandon the plan to build rail baltic if the findings of the feasibility study are negative . 
  `` i 'm quite convinced that most european railways are supported by the state or the public sector , '' he said . 
   `` under no circumstances will the government take the decision concerning rail baltic lightly , '' ratas said . 
  will the eurozone have a fiscal union this year then ?

  turkey would have to be stupid to throw that away over 8 people not being extradited because an independent court ruled against extradition .

   according to statistics estonia 's initial estimates , the population of estonia was 1,317,800 on jan. 1 this year , which is 1,850 persons more than at the same time a year ago . 
   the population of estonia increased for the second consecutive year because immigration has been higher than emigration and negative natural increase combined , the statistical office said on monday . 
   the population decreased by 1,370 due to negative natural increase ( the number of deaths exceeded the number of births ) and increased by 3,220 due to positive net migration ( more persons immigrated to estonia than emigrated ) . 
  in total , the population of estonia increased by 0.14 percent in 2016 .
