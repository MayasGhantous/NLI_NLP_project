  the hourly pay rate in the italian public sector is 40pc above that in the private sector , whereas in france and germany , the hourly rate in the public sector is below that in the private sector . 
   incidentally , in ireland , hourly pay in the public sector is 25pc above that in the private sector . 
   in italy , healthcare and pensions absorb 20pc of gdp , as against 12pc in ireland . 
   there are also severe inefficiencies in italy 's commercial sector caused by lack of adequate competition and out-of-date laws . 
  the transport and energy sectors are particularly costly . 
   there is a lack of competition in the legal system . 
  the courts are the third slowest in the eu . 
  it takes 500 days to get a case into court . 
  this means it is difficult and costly for businesses to enforce contracts and collect debts owed to them . 
  court delays have also contributed to the increase in non-performing loans ( npls ) in the italian banking system . 
  npls are now 18pc of all loans , as against 6pc in 2007 . 
   the bankruptcy laws in italy are impossibly cumbersome . 
   a competition bill , which would have helped resolve some of these problems , was blocked and watered down in the bargaining between the senate and the lower house . 
   renzi 's constitutional reforms , which would have reduced the power of the senate , would have dealt with that . 
  unfortunately , they were rejected by the voters . 
   the gentiloni government , like that led by renzi , has a majority in the lower house , but will now face an increased risk that any reforms it proposes will be bogged down in the senate , because the senate will feel empowered by the referendum result . 
   resolving italy 's problems will require statesmanship of a high order in rome , brussels , frankfurt and berlin . 
  ireland overcame a similar crisis since 2010 , and the willingness of all sectors of society here to meet the painful challenge quickly , and leave politics aside until later , may provide a model that italy could follow . 
  if it paints the uk in a negative light they will upvote , most wo n't even read the article . 
  let me know when they actually convict him . 
  people of power seem to get away with all sorts of crime . 
  thanks for letting me know about this , my young cousin ( 2 and a bit ) has a massive penchant for using stickers and they seem aplenty in the packs , 
  not sure why your comment was downvoted whereas the 4 word reply from the other guy got massively upvoted , but thanks for those links they were quite informative . 
  how much of that export market is to other euro using nations ? 
  not allowed to joke about these sorta things in this sub mate , you should know that by now . 
  georgia could become the netherlands of the caucasus region . 
  if china decides to begin shipping through georgia and the black sea , the ports will be bustling cargo back and forth between georgia and romania & bulgaria . 
  surprised the indy is even allowed as a submission in / r/europe . 
  it 's basically buzzfeed at this point . 
  look at the casualties for battles the soviets undertook in ww2 then contrast to say operation compass . 
  the ussr lost so many soldiers to desertion ( they would shoot them ) , poor equipment and terrible strategies . 
  if it was n't for shipments from the uk and the us the soviet union would n't have held as they did either . 
  probably the same deal that south korea got . 
  did n't migrants cross through croatia and sleep rough in croatian graveyards , even going so far as to defecate on some of the tombstones ? 
  that 's easy . 
  they 'll both just move their youth to germany once they 're in the eu . 
  probably yes . 
  i 'm looking for the absolute migration numbers but i ca n't find any . 
  about the same for switzerland and austria too . 
  more people from north korea moved to the eu than from south korea . 
  i 'm sorry but this is clearly a map of eu cities not european ones . 
  no moscow , st petersburg , oslo , zurich , bern or geneva . 
  i mean cyprus no disrespect , but the fact that nicosia ranked 60/60 and that swiss , russian and norwegian cities did not even feature shows that . 
  they are scottish populists who foster division . 
  the similarities between salmond and farage are quite striking . 
  both full of hot air , blame someone else for their failures . 
  like farage , salmond stepped down as head of his party then came back . 
  [ alex salmond and rupert murdoch ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/77037000/jpg/_77037310_77037309.jpg ) they were good buddies . 
  i would love to get nigel farage , jeremy hunt , rupert murdoch , nicola sturgeon , alex salmond , tony blair and boris johnson and strand them all on some uninhabitable rock thousands of miles from civilisation . 
  on ya bike you divisive , lying , horrible little man . 
  mainly the kingdom of mercia and the kingdom of wessex fighting over the south west and midland region of the uk . 
  norwegians and danish people kept invading york to kill monks before sailing off again . 
  they also settled most scottish isles which they used to launch raids against great britain . 
  the danes crushed mercia , causing them to retreat towards wales . 
  erm , plenty of russians in latvia and estonia also no ? 
  the burgers are better at ~ ~ hungry jack 's ~ ~ ** burger king ** . 
  yes it is ... iceland and ireland are in europe , why would n't the uk be ? 
  kids and animals ca n't give consent so they should always be out of any sexual things anyway . 
  minted 6 years before the biggest eu expansion . 
  i 'm glad the pilot got out okay . 
  how often do pilots get to dry run landings on an aircraft carrier ? 
  it takes considerable skill . 
  aww , i thought it was 3 not 13 . 
  well , never mind then . 
  thanks for the link though , it 's much appreciated !, 
  if the tories lose 3 more mps they lose their majority . 
  an idea like that was put forward earlier this year but was lambasted by india for they claimed it was a racist policy designed to keep them out . 
  i had a preconceived negative bias against them based on my uninformed opinion . 
  130,000 people migrated to the uk looking for work ( without a job to go to ) and we hit record numbers of migrants moving from the eu . 
  this was all pre-vote . 
   for the first time , romania tops the list for the country with the most number of migrants to the uk - with 54,000 people coming to live in britain . 
  the press is going to have a field day . 
  i ca n't find the stats right now , but only around 40 % of brits have a positive view of romanians compared to ~ 65 % for austrians , italians , etc. 
  the media already runs romania 's name through the dirt as it is with their bogus stories .
