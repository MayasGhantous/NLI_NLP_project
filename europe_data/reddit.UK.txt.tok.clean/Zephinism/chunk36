   around 60 % of europe 's roma population is thought to live in ghettoised districts , which in turn is strongly associated with poverty . 
  i feel really bad about this but i actually thought it would be higher than that . 
  i 'm here in a typical boring yet bustling midlands city . 
  ` among former soviet states and europe ' they 're former soviet states . 
  we should get him on a plane to brussels but divert it to the hague at the last minute so he can face justice . 
  the scots are not servants to the english . 
  we 're equals . 
  maybe the welsh are servants though , nobody seems to value their opinion . 
  you forgot india collapsing because they just caused over 80 % of the money in circulation to be worthless . 
  kazakhstan has a higher gdp ( ppp ) per capita than eu members hungary , latvia , croatia , romania and bulgaria . 
  using last years figures anyway . 
  [ ukraine today ] ( http://uatoday.tv/politics/eu-ukraine-visa-free-epic-tale-the-day-that-never-comes-812778.html ) did a very good article on this a couple of days ago . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's paywalled or not so i will post it in this comment . 
   ukraine 's quest for eu visa-free regime goes on and on with no end in sight  despite all the allegations and suggestions , ukraine has n't obtained the eu visa-free regime so far . 
   the date of abolishing visas has been postponed many times , and yet we still we do n't know when will the ukrainians start travelling europe freely . 
  according to the latest news , the eu officials fail to approve the necessary suspension mechanism by the end of 2016 , so abolishing visas for ukraine and georgia is likely to be postponed again - at least until summer 2017 , just after holding crucial presidential elections in france . 
   the long-awaited decision on visas is being pushed back because of the concerns of france , belgium , germany and italy , the european parliament president martin shultz told on thursday . 
   nevertheless , ukraine has successfully fulfilled all 114 options demanded by the eu officials for cancelling visas , so now it 's up to the european bureaucracy to have their final say , ukrainian officials say . 
  hello there !, 
  i did not realise there were many redditors in this neck of the woods , let alone another / r/europe poster !, 
  in dorset there are places like puddletown , tolpuddle & alfpuddle on the piddle ( yes with an i ) river . 
  there 's all these winterborne places located on the winterborne river ( borne = stream ) which only appears in the winter . 
  in new forest ( where i live ) we have places like [ sandy balls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sandy_balls ) , [ godshill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godshill,_hampshire ) , [ nomansland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nomansland,_wiltshire ) & [ charlton-all-saints ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charlton-all-saints ) . 
  you 'll see a lot of them replicated in the new england area of the usa . 
  ok well i think when my family lived in switzerland we integrated pretty well . 
  do malta and cyprus not have the roaming deal or did they just get left out by accident ? 
  yeah it 's almost like they have an axe to grind . 
  it does n't really matter though as this question was moronic and poorly asked . 
  i enjoy writing the subtitles for his videos but once i got up to 1:37 and had to type out those names i gave up . 
  can a finnish person help out ? 
  why would they name a city in the centre of the country ` boat ' ? 
  should n't that be a coastal city name ?

  i 'm not going to downvote you for the snip at the end there but you need to understand just how much damage thatcher inflicted upon the working class and even the middle-class in the uk . 
  in her never ending pursuit of capitalism she destroyed job security for millions and relegated them to welfare and poverty . 
  she ruined towns across the country that were not competitive enough and forced communities apart by the subsequent north-south migration that ensued . 
  following thatcher the rich/poor divide has done nothing but grow . 
  speaking personally , she ruined the lives of both of my parents families and was the reason my mother 's family abandoned cheshire after being there for hundreds of years . 
  when she died , i remember my parents buying a load of plonk and celebrating ... 
  the biggest protests across the uk in history were against the iraq war and nothing came of it as blair merrily carried on . 
  i have nothing but contempt for the man . 
  the fact that he was made ` peace envoy to the middle east ' after what he did is a disgrace . 
  too expensive to go to belarus ... why are visas so much ? 
  playing by the rules , except for the rigging against sanders . 
  find a nice dogging spot and off ya go . 
  you just replied to a serb calling us xenophobic lol . 
  did you actually take his comment seriously ? 
   royal navy besieged the coast . 
  did n't the royal navy do that to help estonia and latvia though ? 
  have you ever met a refugee before ? 
  in french switzerland you learn german ( not swiss-german ) from 1st grade . 
  the uk and france have a military union that would continue regardless of nato/eu , and we already have bases in cyprus . 
  we share a direct land border with ireland and have the world 's oldest military alliance with portugal . 
  i think we could work something out , especially if france is taking part in this too . 
  farage never had any ideas . 
  he 's a demagogue who could point out flaws in things , but never in any of his speeches does he ever present a solution . 
  people replying are trolls , when the op wrote  angela merkel now is the leader of the free world . 
  as if this were fact . 
   $ 2300/month i do n't know how you could afford that ... that 's more than i take home a month .

  i looked at the nordic countries and thought that it was pretty neat that the names were the same in english ... until i got to denmark . 
  what the hell is that ? 
  were n't the s-70-19 black hawks made in the uk by westland ? 
  otherwise known as ws-70, 
  [ they do though . 
  is that map pre-libyan civil war ? 
   however , italy fears the groups are facilitating people smuggling and encouraging migrants to make the passage , and it has proposed a code of conduct governing how they operate . 
   some groups , including msf , have refused to sign the code . 
   they object to a requirement that italian police officers be on their boats and that the boats must take migrants to a safe port themselves , rather than transferring them to other vessels to allow smaller boats to stay in the area for further rescues . 
  the proposed code of conduct seems quite reasonable from italy given that is where the ngos were bringing the migrants . 
  the vale is wales no ? 
  cyprus , a member of the european union , is greyed out . 
  so then what is austria to you ? 
  going off your post history you 're from south africa . 
  i 'd wager that despite these infrequent attacks in western europe , we is far safer than south africa . 
  vice sold out to rupert murdoch ( fox news/sky news/news corp. owner ) back in 2013 . 
  yes , you are right . 
  thanks for the correction, 
  more russians live in their capital than latvians . 
  loyal to a fault . 
  the uk helped them secure independence after ww1 . 
  the uk failed to help break them from soviet occupation . 
  latvian people sort of roll with the punches but make the best of a bad situation . 
  they have some weird forest sex pagan tradition . 
  latvia is also home to the dying latgalian language . 
  road links in latvia suck . 
  generally lumped in with lithuanians but culturally and historically different to their southern neighbours . 
  acted as a doormat for various empires over the years as they have often been subjugated or ethnically cleansed . 
  one of the few countries in the world that nobody dislikes or has a bone to pick with . 
  yours actually includes northern ireland as well .
