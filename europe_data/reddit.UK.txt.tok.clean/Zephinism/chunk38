  they come to europe , we determine their asylum status , we deport those who fail . 
  we need to strike comprehensive deportation deals with asylum-seeker prone countries like we have with afghanistan . 
  also one thing our governments could do is if someone claims asylum please lock them in a secure refugee camp until their asylum claim is processed , and if they fail their claim put them in a deportation camp . 
  none of this sleeping on the streets and roaming schengen bullshit . 
  we should n't allow people to drown at sea if we can help it . 
  if they make an asylum claim when they land it should be looked into and assessed . 
  if they are not worthy of asylum they should be deported . 
  the eu is working deals out with countries to deport their citizens . 
  the eu can deport an unlimited number of afghans and is setting up multiple other arrangements with asylum seeker prone countries . 
  if someone is genuinely fleeing war on a boat and we stand there and watch them die because they are black , muslim or just the notion that saving them will encourage more ... 
  i think we 'd have failed ourselves at that point . 
  the biggest problem is deporting failed asylum seekers but it 's getting easier as more deals are being made . 
  i became lactose intolerant at 24 and know your pain , but do n't they have lactose-free milk there ?

  [ source for data ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitviewtableaction.do ), 
  not that surprising to be honest . 
  there are likely to be more single parent british people here than non-eu single parents ( per capita ) in a family nucleus the woman in the household is less likely to work than the man . 
  the uk allows for non-eu family members to be brought over to the uk . 
  if i were to guess i would guess most of these unactive 20-64 year olds are women of foreign background whose spouses meet the 22k/yr requirement for family reunification . 
  edit : checked the data source [ here ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitviewtableaction.do ) foreign ( non-eu ) males aged 15-74 had an unemployment rate of 4.8 % in 2016 in the uk . 
  foreign ( non-eu ) females aged 15-74 had an unemployment rate of 6.9 % in 2016 in the uk . 
  in 2007 it was 6.8 % unemployment for non-eu men and 8.9 % for non-eu women . 
  why would n't you take an irish passport if the choice was available to you ? 
  my nan applied for her irish passport through descent as my great-great-grandfather moved to the uk in the late 1800s last year despite my nan herself never having lived there . 
  she holidays a lot so it 'll be easier for her to travel . 
  sadly , not just in the uk either .
