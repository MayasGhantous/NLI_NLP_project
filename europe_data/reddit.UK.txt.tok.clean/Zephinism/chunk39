  for some reason they did n't have numbers for cyprus , luxembourg or malta and when i went to get the figures for the 3 missing countries from politicos linked source , the office for national statistics [ \\ ( link here \\ ) ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/datasets/populationoftheunitedkingdombycountryofbirthandnationalityunderlyingdatasheets ) the numbers were off for pretty much every country when it came to living in the uk . 
  this casts doubt on their other figures since lifting numbers off an excel sheet is not overly complicated yet they were off by remarkable numbers ( ons estimated 286k german nationals living in uk in 2015 , politico put 135k ) . 
  i 've emailed the editor for an explanation . 
  the mountains range from 850-1100 metres above sea level , with villages nestled between the valleys . 
  driving through wales is a bit like the villeneuve to sion drive in switzerland . 
  yeah i see a smattering of those dogooder type of posts and fortunately they seem to be on their way out as people come to their senses , i am just concerned with how easily people on this subreddit can jump to extremes such as murder of the innocent and unarmed . 
  you constructed a strawman and then tried to pin that on them . 
   it 's that ok then ? 
  they can rape and kill with impunity ? 
  they never once said that . 
  i dunno , the thread that came about a month ago had several chains with 20 + upvotes calling for just shooting them with live ammunition . 
  i can get behind deportations and holding people in secure camps until we can do so , but murdering people before they even have a chance to present their case ? 
  [ mods are very responsive to reports though thankfully . 
  * what stereotype do you have of argentina ? 
  argentinians like to show off . 
  * how is life in northern europe ? 
  pretty decent , a bit lacking in the hours of sunlight for most of the country but it 's not that different to most of europe . 
  * have you visited argentina ? 
  what do you think of it ? 
  yes i visited bueno aires in july 2011 . 
  i got a bit sick from jetlag ( was living in australia at the time , very long flight ) & food . 
  i thought it was pretty nice , i bought a really good leather jacket there which came with a little argentinian flag in it . 
  it got pretty scary at night though i have to admit . 
  * what is your favorite music from argentina ? 
  er , i do n't know any music from argentina ( i think ) . 
  * where are you from and how are argentinians seen in your country ? 
  i 'm from england and if argentina is in the news they are seen negatively since it 's almost always something about the falkland islands . 
  * what 's the best place to visit on holidays ? 
  north finland !, 
  arctic circle and just overall great sights . 
  cheaper than norway and sweden . 
  * what 's the best food on the continent ? 
  rosti in switzerland . 
  absolutely love the stuff . 
  * where can you find the prettiest women in europe ? 
  tough one , but i 'd say slovenia . 
  it would n't surprise me if montenegro and serbia join the eu within the next decade . 
  the other balkan countries ... yeah not for a while . 
  it 's pretty decent really . 
  bournemouth sort of fusions with poole and christchurch in an urban sprawl and it is a half hour from southampton . 
  there 's a big google service desk company that is constantly hiring as well as really weird support companies . 
  there 's a company in ringwood ( 15 min drive from bournemouth via the a338 ) that has ~ 300 german speaking staff to manage germany 's biggest lotto ( lotto 6 aus 49 ) . 
  not sure why they do n't have the support actually in germany , wages would be competitive i imagine . 
  here a lot of them expect you to have prior experience and wo n't train you in the relevant licence ( s ) but still pay you like shit . 
  security jobs pay pretty dire here as well from # 8/hr for daytime retail security to # 10/hr for nighttime site theft prevention security . 
  have n't gone to alton towers since 2006 lol , i remember the queues for some rides were 2 hours minimum . 
  what 's it like nowadays ? 
  lots of jobs going in my area ( new forest , hampshire ) . 
  unemployment is much lower than national average . 
  security , construction , translation , it services , fruit pickers , bar staff , retail , forestry , travel agents , bus drivers , truck drivers , aerospace , nhs staff , etc. 
  for security roles they 'll pay for your training themselves no experience required . 
  translation roles they need people who speak german , romanian , polish , french , bulgarian . 
  they just get someone fluent to talk to you in a language , and then have you write a few sentences in your language & english and hire you for # 10/hr + downside is house prices are crazy unless you live in immigrant heavy areas . 
  it 's pretty much poles , lithuanians , bulgarians and romanians all cramped into one small area and the rest paying outrageous rents or inheriting houses . 
  [ ( boscombe , bournemouth ) ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@50.7258948,-1.8420854,3a,75y,92.41h,84.49t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sd7hklfnblohxzzimunwmza!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dd7hklfnblohxzzimunwmza%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d109.52569%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656 ), 
  up until a few years ago [ alton towers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alton_towers#ride_statistics ) was more popular than legoland windsor in the uk . 
  i guess that ride safety failures have put people off going . 
  such a shame . 
  ok so to start you do n't need to tell me to fuck off & most of what you said is factually incorrect and you are confusing yourself over names of countries . 
  first to clear out the ireland part . 
  the isle is called ireland . 
  on this isle lies the republic of ireland & the six counties of northern ireland . 
  people colloquially call the republic of ireland ` ireland ' just as they call the united states of america ` america ' . 
  in 1284 edward i of the kingdom of england conquered the kingdom of wales and turned it into a principality . 
  in the 1530s new laws were written and wales became a country once again equal to england ( in theory ) . 
  in 1603 the king of scotland , james vi also became king james i of england and wales . 
  king james vi / i ruled over great britain . 
  in 1707 wales & england and scotland combined parliaments in what is known as ` acts of the union ' . 
  the country is named kingdom of great britain . 
  in 1801 the parliament of ireland approves a political union between the isle of ireland and the isle of great britain . 
  the united kingdom of great britain & ireland is born and with it the flag we use today . 
  in 1922 , 26 counties on the isle of ireland regained their independence and formed the irish free state . 
  the uk as we know it today is born , the united kingdom of great britain & northern ireland . 
  the flag of the kingdom of england has never been used to represent the united kingdom , and since our first political union with scotland we have used a combination of the english and scottish flag as we are equals . 
  lack of education . 
  london is really overpriced and unaffordable to most , that 's true but believe it or not in a country of over 60 million we do have other cities . 
  manchester , liverpool , birmingham , southampton , edinburgh , glasgow , bristol , cardiff , newcastle , etc.
