  - is incompetent / can not plan . 
  so if i convert to shintoism how would i become a risk ? 
  yeah he left sweden though did n't he ? 
  lol, 
   in the last year the number of adults has risen to 3,736 , an 11 percent rise . 
   south korea was never colonized & had a lower gdp per capita than the democratic republic of the congo at it 's time of independence and was able to grow without a colonizer while post-colonial drc has remained the poorest country in the world . 
  wow . 
  yes , south korea grew without a coloniser . 
  just a gigantic funding boost from the united states . 
  great job . 
  wish more countries vetoed it , but this will do . 
  weird , the uk , canada , australia and the us have already been taking ** genuine refugees ** from camps there . 
  did n't have to pay turkey though . 
  because when the ottoman empire controlled the mid east things were so much better right ? 
  what is really fueling these issues are population growth , climate change ( droughts ) and religion becoming more conservative . 
  syria had a population of 6.379 million in 1970 . 
  40 years later syria had a population of 21.53 million . 
  switzerland had a population of 6.181 million in 1970 . 
  40 years later switzerland had a population of 7.825 million . 
  drought + population boom + lack of jobs & infrastructure + conservative islam = ?? 
  you believe in some grandiose utopia ? 
  no we wo n't . 
  northern ireland is as euroskeptic as the welsh and english . 
  as for scotland , who cares ? 
  every time something does n't go their way they have a fit . 
  they 'll get over it . 
  we gave turkey 3 billion euros , nothing changed . 
  giving them 20 billion will make them get off their ass ? 
  hahaha . 
  fool me once , shame on you ; fool me twice , shame on me . 
  how about no . 
  you can shut down an illegal protest without resorting to violence you know . 
  it 's like anyone looking for change in turkey are terrorists these days . 
  i am still reeling in shock . 
  p.s - sensationalist article titles suck , euobserver . 
  it is nothing but pr spin but nobody outside of turkey is buying it anymore . 
  i ca n't think of anything . 
  i like welsh and portuguese the most . 
  i also dislike dutch and german ( too coarse ) . 
  the only thing i could find was ethnicity in london , http://imgur.com/a/ajofh the number ranges are different and quite wide , and it only encompasses white british , black carribean , chinese , pakistani and irish . 
  check op 's post history and his comment score . 
  how does this guy still post here ? 
  ah well , enjoy your shitstirring . 
  they were probably making a navy joke in reference to all the navy posts that occurred over the past few days . 
  you did n't need to get so angry . 
  what a foolish thing to say . 
  many of us across the continent that is europe lost large swathes of our family to the various wars that have ravaged europe across the previous century . 
  juncker would be better off looking at what led up to these wars . 
  according to eurostat documents , found [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7203832/3-04032016-ap-en.pdf/ ) : * 29 % of first time applicants were from syria * 14 % of first time applicants were from afghanistan * 10 % of first time applicants were from iraq * 5 % of first time applicants were from kosovo * 5 % of first time applicants were from albania * 4 % of first time applicants were from pakistan * 3 % of first time applicants were from eritrea * 2 % of first time applicants were from nigeria * 2 % of first time applicants were from iran * 26 % of first time applicants were from other countries the top 3 country of origins of applicants for each eu nation was : * austria - afghanistan ( 29 % ) , syria ( 29 % ) , iraq ( 15 % ) * belgium - syria ( 26 % ) , iraq ( 24 % ) , afghanistan ( 20 % ) * bulgaria - iraq ( 34 % ) , afghanistan ( 31 % ) , syria ( 30 % ) * croatia - syria ( 18 % ) , kosovo ( 7 % ) , afghanistan ( 10 % ) * cyprus - syria ( 43 % ) , palestine ( 8 % ) , vietnam ( 6 % ) * czech republic - ukraine ( 46 % ) , syria ( 11 % ) , cuba ( 10 % ) * denmark - syria ( 41 % ) , iran ( 13 % ) , afghanistan ( 11 % ) * estonia - ukraine ( 42 % ) , iraq ( 7 % ) , syria ( 7 % ) * finland - iraq ( 63 % ) , afghanistan ( 16 % ) , somalia ( 6 % ) * france - sudan ( 8 % ) , syria ( 7 % ) , kosovo ( 5 % ) * germany - syria ( 36 % ) , albania ( 12 % ) , kosovo ( 8 % ) * greece - syria ( 29 % ) , afghanistan ( 14 % ) , pakistan ( 13 % ) * hungary - syria ( 37 % ) , afghanistan ( 26 % ) , kosovo ( 14 % ) * italy - nigeria ( 21 % ) , pakistan ( 12 % ) , the gambia ( 10 % ) * ireland - pakistan ( 41 % ) , bangladesh ( 9 % ) , albania ( 7 % ) * latvia - iraq ( 26 % ) , vietnam ( 24 % ) , ukraine ( 14 % ) * lithuania - ukraine ( 22 % ) , georgia ( 16 % ) , russia ( 13 % ) * luxembourg - syria ( 27 % ) , iraq ( 23 % ) , afghanistan ( 9 % ) * malta - libya ( 53 % ) , syria ( 23 % ) , ukraine ( 4 % ) * netherlands - syria ( 43 % ) , eritrea ( 17 % ) , iraq ( 7 % ) * poland - russia ( 68 % ) , ukraine ( 15 % ) , tajikistan ( 5 % ) * portugal - ukraine ( 45 % ) , mali ( 10 % ) , pakistan ( 8 % ) * romania - syria ( 45 % ) , iraq ( 16 % ) , afghanistan ( 7 % ) * slovakia - iraq ( 63 % ) , afghanistan ( 9 % ) , ukraine ( 6 % ) * slovenia - afghanistan ( 17 % ) , iraq ( 17 % ) , iran ( 12 % ) * spain - syria ( 39 % ) , ukraine ( 23 % ) , palestine ( 5 % ) * sweden - syria ( 33 % ) , afghanistan ( 26 % ) , iraq ( 13 % ) * united kingdom - eritrea ( 10 % ) , iran ( 10 % ) , pakistan ( 8 % ), 
  normalised us-cuban relationships ( not solely down to him ) . 
  also oversaw the iran deal . 
  these could both be attributed to john kerry as well . 
  good . 
  much work needs to be done on the eu 's newest members anyway . 
  infrastructure , roads and job creation in bulgaria and romania should be top priority . 
  i 'd rather see the entire balkans join the eu first once a few more issues are ironed out it should be okay . 
  have the romanian anti corruption people help macedonia , serbia , bosnia , albania and kosovo by showing them how it 's done . 
  can worry about ukraine , belarus , moldova etc later . 
  they were mad he was speaking english . 
  title makes it seem like he may have been speaking persian . 
  he teaches at london 's guildhall school of music and drama [ credit : jimmylehgs ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/48s5gt/iranian_musician_forced_to_stop_cologne_concert/d0m1kyi ), 
  coming from a dane i ca n't help but think this is sarcasm . 
  for a country of 9.6 million people 27.88 billion euros over 4 years is quite the sum . 
  are they able to raise it even higher or is this fixed until 2019 ? 
  uk/england . 
  nhs is overworked and underfunded . 
  lost two relatives to preventable issues over the past 3 years because they were seen be incompetent doctors after too long a wait . 
  when they were eventually seen by a proper doctor it was too late . 
  housing market is fubar . 
  cheap housing is gone . 
  housing prices are crazy across most of england . 
  the government , with 26 % of the vote , received 100 % of the power . 
  crazy . 
  germany had the east/west divide , austria did not . 
  hmm , i would say most swiss can speak 1 language fluently and the second one to a reasonable level ( comprehension ) . 
  in vaud swiss school system i was taught german as well as french from grade 1 , english from grade 5 and italian in grade 9 as elective . 
  most of my classmates from those days that i speak to on fb speak french fluently and have a high understanding of german and english . 
  romansch is barely spoken at all . 
  woah , that is a surprise . 
  in the uk portuguese is not taught which i find disappointing as for england portugal is our oldest ally . 
  do portuguese only learn english then with a spanish elective later ? 
  as i read into the sources for this top 15 i begin to feel that it is flawed to some degree . 
  they list singapore in the top 15 yet singapore 's official language is english . 
  no it does n't really surprise me . 
  the netherlands & scandinavia have been stable and rebuilding as a united country ( unlike say belgium ) since the second world war . 
  there has n't been significant military investment in them ( finland aside ) so a lot goes into education . 
  norway benefited from well managed oil profit redistribution of wealth . 
  spain came out of a dictatorship , france lost many colonies and dealt with a lot of issues from north africa since ww2 . 
  germany was divided until 1989 and has spent a lot to improve standards in east germany . 
  other states were under communist control . 
  all of these things would 've taxed on education and i suspect west germans speak english at a higher proficiency than east . 
  i ca n't really think of a reason for austria being behind poland or even germany , but italy and portugal make sense in a way since their languages are latin based . 
  i do n't know what they 're taught in school there but i imagine spanish for portugal and french for italy ? 
  the surprising country for me in that list is slovenia . 
  ex-yugoslav central european country with no historical ties to the uk speaks english at the 6th best in the world . 
  estonia is not far behind but estonia has one of the best educational systems in the world ( in my humble opinion ) and is very talented . 
  their leaders can speak english quite well too . 
  argentina being 15th is just funny though . 
  do they learn english to see what we say about them in the news ? 
  :p * edit * before you get upset , i 'm just basing this off my own preconceived ideas , i can be factually incorrect .
