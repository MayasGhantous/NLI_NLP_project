  manchester-liverpool-leeds-sheffield are all well connected and improving with a smattering of towns in the area . 
  they have air , sea and train links across great britain and to mainland europe too . 
  i wish companies would see past the mantra of ` capital cities ' . 
  berlin is n't even that great compared to the bonn-dortmund area . 
  reading this made me really happy . 
  nicely done malta !, 
  so far in 2017 ascension island , the falkland islands , guernsey , the faroe islands , finland , bermuda and now malta have legalised same-sex marriage . 
  germany and taiwan are wrapped up in bureaucracy but it is likely to be legalised in both countries this year too . 
  armenia recently decided to recognise all same-sex marriages performed outside their borders . 
  hopefully jersey , aruba and italy will follow soon . 
  the independent is labour not liberal . 
  what did you expect the uk to do ? 
  magic up some way to land in the east and recapture poland ? 
  though it would only account for a small number , there have been a number of lithuanian gang members arrested in the uk and ireland who are then sent to lithuania . 
  they steal cars , dismantle them and sell the pieces online . 
  lmao !, 
  you actually went and deleted a whole bunch of your comments . 
  you left a few rather inoffensive ones but all the ones about obama you purged including that submission that had over 3k karma . 
  you just forgot to delete [ your actual submissions ] ( http://i.imgur.com/poxdvd8.png ) it seems . 
  we 're done here . 
  if we sort your comment history by ` best ' a bunch of posts in t_d show up so excuse me if i am a little sceptical about that worshipper part . 
  eh , there are problems with illegal immigrants from africa in guangzhou but they are nothing compared to problems with illegal immigants in europe . 
  when i lived in dorchester the water we got from the tap was absolutely horrible . 
  since then i 've always filtered my tap water through a brita jug and i 've stopped buying bottled water . 
  easier to just bottle filtered water and store it in the fridge until i 'm going out anyway . 
  so unless you 're cooling your car or walking around an attraction park , why would you need bottled water anyway ? 
  for people on the yahoo comment sections the sun revolves around the glorious united states of america . 
  they do n't care that the chances of him having come here illegally are minute . 
  a year after the fall of the berlin wall . 
  the channel tunnel achievement continues to amaze me . 
  how can rents still be that high despite population loss ? 
  is there some sort of consortium of landlords that decides on the prices for rent there ? 
  should n't there be a property surplus ? 
  san marino allows foreign people who are in a same-sex relationship with a sammarinese person to stay in the country . 
  in march 2016 3 parties have announced various policies to allow same-sex marriage without adoption rights .

  that table is pretty interesting , thanks . 
  top 3 countries of origin for asylum seekers in iceland . 
  former yugoslav republic of macedonia , albania and iraq . 
  iraq i can understand lol , but fyrom and albania ? 
  he just called germans nazis again btw . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-40442064  mr erdogan castigated germany for the ban , accusing the government of `` nazi-style '' behaviour . 
  the lapel pin is the grand master of the order of the legion of honor . 
  only the french president may wear it . 
  same happens in prisons here . 
  one of the easiest ways to avoid it is for ee citizens to stop commiting crimes that carry a prison sentence in we . 
  another brit here , since you bring up nationality , i am going to make the assumption that you are italian based on your flair . 
  the economy of italy has been stagnant since the 2008 collapse , losing 2 decades of growth . 
  italy has many , many big banks that need constant taxpayer cash injections to keep functional . 
  italy is already a net contributor to the eu budget so each italian will have to pay even more to fill this hole . 
  countries that italy pays towards such as poland , hungary , slovakia and czech republic spit in your face when it comes down your country asking for help managing the ever increasing number of illegal migrants . 
  yeah brexit is a fucking stupid mutilation given all the special opt-outs the uk had within the eu and the nhs 350m was debunked as complete shit by the remain campaign 5 minutes after it was announced . 
  the uk will struggle to wade through the pool it just shat in and that wo n't be pleasant for us but italy had better hope it does n't turn into a greece 2.0 when so many eu members take it for granted and abuse it . 
  you 've got shitty banks , increasing illegal migration , increasing eu contribution requirements and eu members who make things harder for you at home to play for an audience . 
  argentina wants to remove the british citizens from the falkland islands . 
  this ruling is against moving people from their home islands ( chagos islands in this case ) . 
  argentina voted in favour . 
  with their pathetic claim over the falklands , this vote would just further them from having a claim over the islands . 
  it is interesting to see who voted against and who abstained though , a lot of traditional alliances seem to have been broken . 
  abortion ban at work . 
  i thought macedonia sub was https://www.reddit.com/r/mkd/, 
   prior to cypriot accession to the eu in 2004 , eu law did not apply to the sovereign base areas . 
  this position was changed by the cypriot accession treaty and eu law , while still not applying in principle , applies to the extent necessary to implement a protocol attached to that treaty . 
  this protocol applies eu law relating to the common agricultural policy , customs , indirect taxation , social policy and justice and home affairs to the sovereign base areas . 
  the sovereign base areas ' authorities have also made provision for the unilateral application of directly applicable eu law . 
  the uk also agreed in the protocol to keep enough control of the external ( i.e. 
  off-island and northern cyprus ) borders of the base areas to ensure that the border between the sovereign base areas and the republic of cyprus can remain fully open and will not have to be policed as an external eu border . 
  consequently , the sovereign base areas will become a de facto part of the schengen area if and when cyprus implements it . 
  cyprus is not in schengen and already has a deal with the uk on border passings . 
  let me explain this to you in a simple manner . 
  * italy receives illegal migrants from algeria . 
  * italy asks algeria to take back their illegal migrants . 
  * algeria says no . 
  * italy and the rest of the eu decline all visa requests by algerian people , including their wealthy and businessmen . 
  * algerian upper classes pressure algerian government to accept the return of illegal migrants . 
  * eu lifts visa restrictions on algeria once illegal migrants are returned . 
  1 year in and we still have little to no idea about what it means for us , our future and our country 's future . 
  all we got was ` brexit means brexit ' . 
  off to the pub now though thanks for the reminder / u/tack50, 
  who was the journalist interviewing him ? 
  all the sources i 've found for this interview are rightwing shitrags ( infowars , britainfirst , therebelmedia , etc. ), 
  and not a single 1 of them name the interviewer . 
  then again , all dominik does is deflect . 
  talking about refusing refugees because ` how many attacks have you had in london ' . 
  what 's the relevance here given that not a single one of these attackers were refugees ? 
  it 's probable that the ones that were deported from poland were deported to countries that generally do n't refuse to accept their citizens back . 
  likewise germany could deport albanians , kosovars and serbs who had failed asylum claims pretty easily . 
  ** asylum acceptance rate ** : germany : 58.67 % sweden : 64.59 % france : 23.59 % italy : 49.39 % hungary : 10.52 % austria : 59.04 % united kingdom : 35.97 % netherlands : 64.89 % belgium : 40.54 % greece : 15.51 % norway : 59.32 % bulgaria : 85.00 % denmark : 61.36 % poland : 21.42 % finland : 40.62 % spain : 47.82 % ** successful deportation rate ( returned home after ordered to leave ) : ** germany : 85.78 % sweden : 55.29 % france : 20.73 % italy : 21.01 % hungary : 42.85 % austria : no stats united kingdom : 69.86 % netherlands : 29.33 % belgium : 16.16 % greece : 30.29 % norway : no stats bulgaria : 7.14 % denmark : 31.25 % poland : 90.16 % finland : 48.57 % spain : 35.53 % between 2012-2016 , ** 3,709,000 ** people applied for asylum for the first time in the above listed european countries and ** 875,000 ** were deported . 
  the last column shows people deported . 
  875 000 people were deported from the listed countries from 2012-2016 . 
  lots of gay people are afraid to come out to their parents if their parents follow any faith at all tbh . 
  +6 celsius temperature anomaly, 
  someone has to pick them , and most of the places around here pay you by the weight and not by minimum wage/hr . 
  wages in the west are pretty stagnant whilst wages in prague specifically are picking up . 
  unemployment in spain and france is considerably higher . 
  ethnic north african numbers are increasing in france . 
  neither you nor the other poster actually answered how visible ethnic minorities would be viewed there . 
  especially as most are more open with their faith . 
  well if they are british , french , spanish etc they could be interested in moving to the czech republic for work . 
  low unemployment makes the czech republic an attractive place to settle to work .
