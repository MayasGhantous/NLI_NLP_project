  we have lots of ethnic indian , pakistani , bangladeshi etc in the uk . 
  would they not be welcome in the czech republic ? 
  what about maghreb descent french , belgian or spanish ? 
  turk descent germans and angolese or brazilian descent portuguese ? 
  welcome or not ? 
  apparently when we make our concerns about brexit and the lack of any preparation or plans known we 're just bitter remoaners . 
  when people finally figure out how belgium works bosnia will join the eu and kill the eu project with their ability to cause mass confusion . 
   in the meantime , as he explained on air he was surprisingly able to file his tax returns ( well that 's the tax office for you-no problem collecting cash from a person , even if he is dead ) , but when it came to financial benefits from the state it was another deal altogether . 
  try reading the article . 
  ot ; what is the background on your username ? 
  i live right next to sandy balls so am curious . 
  australia too . 
  https://nvite.com/community/thegreatgettogether put in your postcode to find an event near you . 
  was there any reason you decided to skip visting cardiff ? 
   that includes an estimated 6,000 millionaires just in 2016 , a sixfold annual jump i suppose none of them will keep their money in try either . 
  +23 for suggesting mistreating vetted refugees to prove a point to ` leftists ' . 
  and some people claim this subreddit is too leftwing . 
  what a joke . 
  i posted the source for you , i hope you do n't mind . 
  [ here is a breakdown ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qmyhzol.png ) from december 2016 . 
  [ source ] ( http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/researchbriefing/summary/cbp-7783 ), 
  it was stickied at the top of the page , not sure if that makes it an announcement or just a sticky post . 
  the welsh one was posted a little over a month ago in / r/europe but took place in / r/wales . 
  my constituency went from 59.9 % conservative to 66.8 % conservative . 
  got ta love new forest west , i 'm off to bed . 
  i really hope labour stops them getting a majority . 
  you vote for the person in theory , but we have ` whips ' which force mps to vote along party lines on most issues unless a free vote is called . 
  if the whip is not convincing enough , backbencher mps will rebel and vote with the opposition . 
  lib dems take bath from conservatives with a 17.6 % surge, 
  snp win glasgow east from labour by 75 votes . 
  boris johnson holds uxbridge and south ruislip , his majority dropping from 23.9 % to 10.8 %, 
  by 169 votes . 
  crazy especially when sdlp had a 16.3 % lead on sf just 2 years ago . 
  well there is currently an eu project to link austria to croatia with a 4 lane motorway through slovenia . 
  i suppose after that they will try to connect croatia with bosnia , serbia and montenegro . 
  https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10580/desmond_swayne/new_forest_west/votes this guy will be reelected in my constituency . 
  voted against him but he 's been in since 1997 with over 50 % of the vote . 
  i am pretty much against everything he votes in favour of , so glad he 's representing me for another 5 years ... 
  woah , another from the new forest west ? 
  pretty demoralising to see how the area votes . 
  i cast my vote for labour ( despite being more of a lib dem ) but tories will get over 50 % anyway . 
  the drop in readership in just 7 years is staggering . 
  spain also has almost twice as many police per capita than the uk . 
  http://i.imgur.com/qlcbzxx.png police forces here are underfunded and too few . 
  alright . 
  a lot of migrants are already in italy and greece , who are buckling under pressure . 
  you are basically saying ` we do n't want to take them ' . 
  so what does poland offer these two countries instead ? 
  will poland pay more money to help greece and italy process , detain , deport and manage migrants ? 
  reading this all i see is ` we do n't want them , good luck ' which is a giant fuck you to other eu members especially when poland is the biggest recipient of eu funds and italy is a net contributor . 
  this is the czech republic 's way of saying ` hey greece and italy ? 
  fuck you guys and enjoy being a dumping ground for migrants . 
  italy pls send eurofunds ! ', 
  kinda like san marino, 
  ok , then let 's concede this is about persecuted christians in the mena region ( rather than ` the world 's most persecuted ' ) . 
  why is it in / r/europe ? 
  i fail to see the world ` religion ' in the title at all . 
  homosexuals and romas are minorities . 
  oh , we must be seeing different titles as i see ` the world 's most persecuted minority : christians ' homosexuals are minorities , are n't they ? 
  the one thing i admire about prageru is they do n't try to hide their overwhelming bias and agenda pushing . 
  anyway yes , christians are more persecuted than gays , atheists and romas . 
  the tombstones with christian crosses on the forefront of mosques is touching .

   brexit is the most important single development in british foreign policy since declaring war on germany in 1939 . 
  it is also arguably the worst unforced error ever in british history this is what the article opens with . 
  brexit is the most important single development in british foreign policy since declaring war on germany ? 
  since 1939 , here are some events the uk has gone through : joining the eec , the suez crisis , the falkland war , the iraq war , the creation of israel , the troubles & goodfriday agreement , the drafting of the united nations charter , the signing of the north atlantic treaty . 
  all of these are less important than brexit for our foreign policy apparently . 
   the general election is showing the extent to which britain has diminished in power over the last year . 
  `` l\u2019angleterre , ce n\u2019est plus grand chose -- england is not much anymore , '' said president de gaulle in 1963 as he vetoed britain 's bid to join the eec . 
  so we will quote de gaulle 's comment about england from 1963 to show that ` britain ' ( not the uk either ) has diminished in power in a year . 
  this comment de gaulle made a year after france lost their biggest colony in africa , algeria . 
  both the uk and france suffered blows after ww2 . 
  british india was gone . 
  french indochina was gone . 
  suez crisis . 
  de gaulle 's dislike of the anglophone world is pretty well documented , so what his quote is worth on a 2017 article about brexit i do not know . 
  i 'll concede that brexit is an extremely risky leap into the unknown for what i see as being little benefit , but the rest of the article is pretty much trash . 
  i do n't understand what you are trying to say . 
  is n't that just another way of saying what i said ? 
  new ira/real ira/continuity ira are not the pira but they were founded by former members of the pira , yes ? 
  yeah the pira does not provide them arms ( as far as i 'm aware ) but people from the new ira split off from the pira around 1997-1998 . 
  [ it 's an on-going and seemingly neverending process for northern ireland . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-10866072 ), 
  no , they are continuously doing it but this is a splinter faction known as the ` new ira ' . 
  when the 1998 treaty was signed , some extremists from the provisional ira ( not to be confused with the original ira pre-1969 ) split off to form smaller factions ( new ira , real ira , continuity ira , etc ) . 
  they have been actively attempting and sometimes succeeding with terror plots ever since . 
  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recognising-the-terrorist-threat/recognising-the-terrorist-threat https://www.gov.uk/terrorism-national-emergency/terrorism-threat-levels [ here is a bbc article with a timeline of dissident republican activity in northern ireland since 2009 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-10866072 ), 
  this table must have some mistakes . 
  look at w pps of lithuania in 2000 then 2005 . 
  that does not make sense at all . 
  that is pretty bad . 
  i tried to look at things for the czech republic that were cosponsered by cohesion funds but the 2014-2020 period for czech republic is blank which is strange . 
  2007-2013 period saw a lot of infrastructure investment in the czech republic .
