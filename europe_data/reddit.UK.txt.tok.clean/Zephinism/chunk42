  what about being shot at by rednecks or cinema & college campus mass shootings ? 
  yeah i understand that , i guess i 'm just a bit bitter when i compare and see our wages stagnating and infrastructure being left to rot . 
  but visibly people in lithuania are pushing on . 
  not bad , and with the infrastructure projects ramping up in lithuania it should hopefully stay this way . 
  [ lithuania 's unemployment is below the eurozone average ] ( https://tradingeconomics.com/lithuania/unemployment-rate ) , [ average wage is up 140 $ more per month than it was in 2014 ] ( https://tradingeconomics.com/lithuania/wages ) lithuania is already renovating railways for rail baltica [ 1 ] ( https://www.europeanrailwayreview.com/30716/railway-extra/infrastructure-lithuanian-rail-freight/ ) [ 2 ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/eipp/desktop/en/projects/project-54.html ) [ lithuania also won the european broadband award ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/five-projects-got-first-ever-european-broadband-award ) in 2015 for the best project in the category on socio-economic impact and affordability . 
  [ there is also a target for 30mbps download speed coverage for the entire country by 2020 , 50 % of households to have 100mbps and over speeds . 
  ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/country-information-lithuania ) despite pessimism i often hear about lithuania , things are moving along rapidly and in the right direction . 
  why would he compare the uk to uganda anyway ? 
  that 's such a strange comparison . 
  someone was actually arrested for a post they made on r/unitedkingdom last year so eh jokes aside r/europe mods are pretty chill . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/53y1wi/a_redditor_was_arrested_and_fined_for_an/ ), 
  that queue is magnificent !, 
  the court system will be more lenient on him for being 17 . 
  language ( dialect , slang ) , geography questions, 
   the brandenburg interior ministry said the suspect was syrian but police tweeted that neither the `` syrian nationality '' nor `` concrete attack plans '' could yet be confirmed , and that investigations continued . 
  so they are 17 ( convenient age really ) and have been in germany for almost 2 years yet germany does n't even know if they are syrian ? 
  do n't they do basic tests on asylum seekers ? 
  she 's been doing a stellar job at it since she was home sec . 
  just curious , i had a look at your post history and i would like to know what you deem to be reputable news sources . 
  wtf . 
  country may be going towards brexit , but if it 's nato we 'll honour our commitment . 
  i 'd like to think that our history ( even just the past 100 years ) reflects our commitment to countries in europe both small ( latvia , belgium ) and large ( poland ) . 
  as for the americans , who knows if they 'll wait 4 years before joining again . 
  hopefully spain can countersue these parasites for every last penny . 
  there are so many of these sort of scams . 
  it clogs up the judicial system , destroys livelihoods of people in spain ( and other eu countries too ! ), 
  it also breaks the credibility of proper reports ( i 'm sure we 've all heard of the boy who cried wolf ) . 
  i 've got a dashcam just for these false claim assholes . 
  i do n't know if its prevalent in other eu countries but we have ` brake for cash ' where someone slams their brakes infront of you on the road , leading you to hit them as well as ` flash for cash ' where someone flashes you with their lights to give you passage ( technically they are not legally obliged to ) and then carries on so that you crash into them . 
  melania is 47 . 
  where 's the outrage ? 
  my dad thinks corbyn was part of the ira lol . 
  he 's the guy who kicks the messenger into the well , right ? 
  well net immigration from poland to the uk has certainly fallen . 
   immigration from eu8 states - the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia - was down by 25,000 to 48,000 , while those leaving the country increased by 16,000 in 2015 , to 43,000 last year . 
   these resulted in the smallest net migration estimate of 5,000 for this group of nations since they joined the eu in 2004 [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40043483 ), 
  less than half of london self reported as white british in the last census ( 2011 ) . 
   his mother and father are now believed to be back living in libya . 
  for a while he left the uk too , but he is believed to have returned in the past few days . 
   abedi 's younger brother , 20-year-old hashem abedi , was arrested in tripoli on suspicion of links with the so-called islamic state group on tuesday evening , a spokesman for a local counter-terrorism force rada said . 
   bbc home editor mark easton said the raided area was known to have been home to a number of islamist extremists in recent years ; some with links to syria and libya ; some alive and some dead . 
   a muslim community worker has told bbc news that members of the public called the police anti-terrorism hotline warning about abedi 's extreme and violent views several years ago . 
   they had been worried that `` he was supporting terrorism '' and had expressed the view that `` being a suicide bomber was ok '' . 
   mohammed saeed el-saeiti , the imam at the didsbury mosque , remembers abedi as an dangerous extremist ,  `` salman showed me the face of hate after my speech on isis [ an acronym for the islamic state group ] , '' said the imam . 
   chief constable ian hopkins confirmed that it was clear that abedi had been part of a network of collaborators and home secretary amber rudd said he had been known to security services . 
  we have pretty much given up our right to privacy in this country , and for what ? 
  did he need neon signs saying ' i am a dillusioned religious conservative failure who travels to a country in a civil war that is a known hotbed for isis ' infront of his home before they caught on ? 
  wwi we entered because belgium was invaded . 
  post wwi we fought the russians out of latvia and wwii we entered because poland was invaded . 
  none of those 3 countries did much of anything for us . 
  now belgium is where nato and the eu headquarters are based , poland is the country the most of our 1st generation migrants are from . 
  doubt the average joe here even knows of latvia . 
  probably think its a cool city for their stag night if they 've heard of it . 
  i 'm not overly surprised by out score . 
  wow the forestry commission owns almost all of the new forest . 
  i only checked my local area but its not that interesting . 
  the areas held by foreign entities seem to be held by jersey ( crown dependency ) , gibraltar ( british overseas territory ) and the netherlands ( shell company for tax avoidance ) . 
  to be fair , he did actually spend 6 months in iraq in 2003 serving in the army even though he was an mp . 
  plus he 's the mp with the least expense claims in our local area . 
  but his voting record is not aligned with my views at all . 
  same here . 
  new forest west , hurray ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_forest_west_ ( uk_parliament_constituency ) #elections, 
  [ or this . 
  is your username ironic ? 
  sorry only just saw this before going to bed , but i 'll dig up the source for you tomorrow . 
  you know , these sort of stories popping up actually make me happy in a way . 
  it is no longer taboo to talk about massive and rife sexual exploitation of children in the media . 
  no more hiding of the condemned perpetrators and more centres for people to shelter in . 
  i am just saddened by the sheer scale of the abuse and how many towns let this slide for so long . 
  more needs to be done to support victims and people shouldnt be protected from facing justice due to their race , position or wealth in the uk otherwise the majority will lose faith in the system and take the law into their own hands . 
  edit : removed part about ethnic pakistanis having 3x the incarcerated rate of normal population . 
  i was n't able to find statistics to back my point . 
  the post stood at 151 points at time of edit . 
  nope , opens fine for me . 
  i have noscript and ublock on firefox . 
  what are you using ? 
  possibly army ? 
  if france wants to share their nukes with germany/eu that is . 
  why though ? 
  this is just old people / brexiteers fucking over everyone else on these islands . 
  misery loves company and these idiots will probably drag ireland at least part way into economic misery . 
  all talk . 
  instead we 'll just get more draconian surveillance laws . 
  what about croatia ? 
  man imagine nigel farage and boris johnson duet eurovision 2018 . 
  not sure if you can edit but you spelt australia wrong . 
  your comment history is hilarious . 
  first not actually recognising denmark , poland or finland as actual countries . 
  like wtf ? 
  second saying you 're a swedish immigrant to the us who voted for trump and thinks he 's doing a good job . 
  you are so full of shit i 'm surprised that you have n't burst at the seams yet . 
  this is youtube comment level worth of ` debates ' . 
  a complete farce really . 
  with the absolute bile you 've spewed in a few other subreddits you are in no position to call other people worthless leeches or accuse them of having a degenerate culture . 
  you should seek help . 
  just look at their recent comments . 
  dude your comment history is apologising and blindly defending donald trump . 
  you have no room to talk . 
  ok ivan calm down , it was just 60 years ago western europe had thousands come from hungary . 
  edit : as refugees , the economic migrant hungarians have just been this past decade .
