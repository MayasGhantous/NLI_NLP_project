  people with money will store their cash offshore or buy from companies who will store their cash offshore . 
  people without money barely have enough to get by on , if that . 
  makes sense some saudi military supplies would go missing after they arrived in turkey . 
   i could explicitly point out everything wrong with your legal reasoning and wording , but i 'll just settle for calling you a cunt . 
  so you could make a proper argument and instead decided to make an ad hominem attack . 
  why did you post ? 
  i did not and will never excuse or defend murderers . 
  just as i will never excuse police ineptitude and the authorities involved in covering up rotherham scandal . 
  keep the gay asylum seekers and the christians . 
  deport all the single males from the other one . 
  do you mean the city of london ? 
  i 'm sure they 'd cope outside the eu . 
  groom & rape over a thousand girls for over a decade . 
  - 6 arrests , prison sentences ~ 10yrs . 
  kill an old guy - 2 arrests , prison sentences ~ 20yrs . 
  we could start with vetoing montenegro 's eu application . 
  where did you read this ? 
  they do n't care , they want to make an example of us . 
  all good though , we 'll never be dictated to by the germans . 
  i lived in switzerland as a foreign and had a few police related issues to resolve . 
  never had to seek legal advice beforehand . 
  depends on what you are being accused of i suppose . 
  for something where they want to check the property i would assume you should get legal advice pronto . 
  that 's really stupid ... it also should n't be you who has to die , this whole thing would be sorted out if the one who refuses to obey constitutional courts got a harsh reality check instead . 
  i thought they werent in the schengen area . 
  they do use euro and follow certain eu laws though . 
  my area is ranked 63 out of 188 for eurosceptism . 
  it 's a tory stronghold where over 40 % of the ges vote went to the tories as well . 
  median age is 60 + . 
  i figured tory strongholds would be more prone to eurosceptism but some labour strongholds are in the top 10 ... 
  it 's true though is n't it ? 
  your government has threatened to ` unleash ' more migrants upon europe unless we pay even more this year . 
  they hoped they would move on and turned a blind eye to it . 
  now that the migrants are piling up they are too numerous to deport . 
  they piled up because more and more came when they realised how easy it is to carry on through the balkans from greece . 
  greece was more than happy to provide poor facilities and encourage them to move on . 
  yeah we should help greece clean this mess up , but greece should own up to the fact that it was intentionally waving migrants north . 
   some in syriza used to argue that providing poor facilities for migrants would encourage them to move along . 
  but thousands of tunisians , moroccans and pakistanis blocked at the macedonian border earlier this month are now settling in . 
  greece can not afford to deport them . 
  maybe they should 've got their act together and deported them instead of hoping they would move along . 
  that didnt create any refugees though did it ? 
  lol latvia . 
  his company paid a mere [ # 4,327 in the uk last year despite giving out over # 35,000,000 in staff bonuses ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/oct/11/facebook-paid-4327-corporation-tax-despite-35-million-staff-bonuses ) . 
  just another obligarch telling the populace what they can and ca n't say or do . 
  i ca n't think of anything nice to say about them or albania . 
  i 've heard a few negatives ( extreme nationalism , mafia , trafficking ) but positive albanian stories never make the news . 
  i also do n't know anything about the history of albania nor do i know the name of the capital city without googling it . 
  then again i do n't know the capital city for montenegro or macedonia either . 
  ignorance is bliss or am i missing out on some cool albanian things ? 
   fairly comprehensive public transport system public transport system in dorset is absolute shite . 
  rest i can agree with . 
  it 's proven that if we leave the eu they 'll all immediately stop trading with us forever . 
  he was released 12 years ago . 
  seems more like a failure of the spanish authorities to keep a close watch on him . 
  though perhaps failure is too harsh given that they stopped him before the act was carried out . 
  i saw a [ vice news documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dubbxiognaw ) on a former detainee living in kazakhstan , his moves are monitored . 
  this is where we differ . 
  your method of deporting them when they are in schengen involves catching them here . 
  schengen is huge . 
  deporting them after they arrive here is a ** reactive policy ** . 
  preventing them from arriving in turkey and beginning their journey into schengen as i suggest is a ** proactive policy ** . 
  i would rather deal with the problem before it becomes a problem and you would rather deal with it after it becomes one . 
  whilst my proactive solution is more restrictive on moroccans and could damage turkish tourist industry , your reactive solution could allow for further drowning in the aegan , more money to people smugglers , increased crime by illegal migrants throughout the schengen ( from trepass to theft & sexual assault ) . 
  what i mean by ` flight risk ' country is that people from morocco are not staying in the country for the purposes of their visa . 
  they catch flights to turkey and then stowaway on ships to greece . 
  giving visa-free access to a country ( such as turkey in the schengen soon ) is a sign of confidence that people from that country will not overstay their 3 months and will return home . 
  clearly people coming from morocco can not be trusted to stay in turkey anymore due to significant numbers going to greece illegally . 
  a british person can get a visa from turkey to visit turkey for up to 90 days because we can generally be trusted to go home after our 90 days our up . 
  admittedly some british citizens have been going to syria after arriving in turkey but turkey is improving their checks and arresting more of these people . 
  unless they can ensure that visiting moroccans stay in turkey they should restrict access to turkey to the wider moroccan population . 
  [ it is also crazy that british people require a visa to enter turkey , yet moroccans do not . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rexgqhg.png ) http://answersafrica.com/countries-moroccans-can-travel-to-without-visa.html, 
  to be fair portugal has the same timezone as us , so do ireland & iceland . 
  turkey should stop issuing visas to people from flight risk countries ( morocco & pakistan ) . 
  that 's essentially the ` he started it ' argument . 
  every country that has armed the jihadists should be ashamed of themselves . 
  i love eating [ r\u00f6sti ( swiss dish ) ] ( http://www.domesticate-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/potato-rosti-with-pancetta-and-mozzarella-step-7.jpg ) as well as raclette & fondue . 
  to be fair when 20 % of them ca n't read i doubt they can look much up . 
  this is the same guardian that has multiple articles that are nothing more than mouthpiece propaganda for ksa ... 
  germany is ` do as i say , not as i do . ', 
  we ca n't stop people coming here telling us they have kids in some foreign country who 've never stepped foot here from claiming child benefits yet germany can stop payments ... 
  most probably went to sweden . 
  the ones we get in calais come through italy and spain do n't they ? 
  i 'm in favour of a spanish , french & british led eu-wide foreign policy . 
  these 3 eu countries have the most ties outside of the eu as combined they have settled in most countries in the world . 
  i 'm also in favour of each country having their head of state ( prime minister , president , etc. ), 
  to assign an eu delegate who will choose to block or allow laws . 
  no more bringing in the leaders of individual nations . 
  have them take care of their citizens instead . 
  these delegates will meet to discuss what the eu parliament has decided ( the elected meps ) and whether to pass things into law or not . 
  all laws must pass with a 70 % rate ** and ** must be agreed upon by at least 2 non-eurozone countries . 
  currently 19/28 countries in the eu use the euro , which is 67 % of countries in the eu . 
  should more countries in the eu use the euro , this would protect those who do n't use the euro from unstoppable euro favoured laws . 
  pakistan , india , bangladesh , china , vietnam , the phillipines , russia , australia , the us & nigeria .

  what country do you live in ? 
  it would be good . 
  knugen could be first . 
  these comparisons are weak and made by the obvious apologists who feel neverending guilt for what were different times .
