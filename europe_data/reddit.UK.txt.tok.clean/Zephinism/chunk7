  to think i 'd been told germans have no sense of humour . 
  clearly i was misled . 
  they 'll get to read all about it in the big issue i 'm sure, 
  not scottish , they 're finnish . 
  yeah , september/october when hundreds of thousands more migrants arrive by the month would 've been a guaranteed brexit . 
  so how much more will bulgaria contribute towards the budget ? 
  pmsl, 
  quote that i agree with wholeheartedly from the comment section on the g.  how about this . 
  you criticize the israeli government , much as you might criticize the chinese government for its actions in tibet , but you do n't try to shame the average israeli citizen by boycotts and hateful rhetoric , or more widely everyone of jewish ethnicity simply because some very small number of their kin are nasty bastards . 
   would anyone think it legitimate to attack chinese citizens going to oxford over the prc 's treatment of ethnic groups within its borders ? 
  would they demand anyone of chinese ethnicity publicly apologize for the chinese occupation of tibet ? 
   let 's be clear here . 
  what 's going on is racism , thinly masked as `` political criticism '' . 
  these people are bigots who have found the latest way to promote anti-semitism .

  how do they still have 2.6 million syrians when this is the number they had before sending over 1 million people to europe last year ? 
  did another million flee syria last to turkey ? 
  oh , thanks for that . 
  we leave , someone has to pick up our tab . 
  with the ways things are running right now , it 'll be germany , and they wo n't bear it for long . 
  germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank , has huge exposure in greece , spain , portugal and italy . 
  once that debt gets too bad for germany and deutsche bank it 's belly up for multiple eu countries , big bust . 
  whine about our concessions all you want ( as a dane that 's quite funny ) but kicking out the second biggest net contributor to the eu would n't be without consequences . 
  despite using the pound we still paid a bit towards stabilising the euro . 
  portugal and england ( biggest part of the uk ) are allies forever . 
  i know more about slovakia than slovenia due to having a slovakian friend in wow who chats a lot and actually speaks english to me ( unlike almost all on the realm who speak slovak or czech and insult english speakers ) . 
  capital of slovakia is bratislava ( kid is lava ) . 
  slovenia is small , near italy and formerly part of yugoslavia . 
  the capital is ljubljanjubjub or something with lots of j 's and l 's . 
  china ones are probably political asylum . 
  iran possibly homosexual or claim to be . 
  bangladesh they could be atheist as there have been increasing cases of killings of atheists there recently . 
  the ruler of the gambia said in may 2015 that if they find out that you 're homosexual there they will slit your throat . 
  somalia has no law enforcement to speak of . 
  anything goes . 
  eritrea has never-ending forced military service we should help sort these issues out in these countries so they do n't have to leave their own countries for fear of their own safety but at the same time it 's not our right to enact change in their countries . 
  for q1 of 2015 ( jan 2015 - mar 2015 ) these are the nationalities and numbers of people applying for asylum from outside of europe ( excluding non-eu european countries ) * 29,100 from syria * 12,910 from afghanistan * 7,295 from iraq * 5,310 from pakistan * 4,220 from nigeria * 3,415 from somalia * 3,155 from eritrea * 3,085 from the gambia * 2,365 from bangladesh * 2,275 from senegal * 2,260 from iran * 1,965 from mali * 1,795 ` stateless ' * 1,575 from algeria * 1,285 from the democratic republic of the congo * 1,250 from china * 1,190 from sudan * 1,145 from libya * 1,105 from guinea * 1,065 from morocco * 1,060 from ivory coast * 18,430 from other non-european nations .

  q1 ( jan-mar ) 2015 there were over 185,000 first time asylum applicants in the eu in those 3 months . 
  q2 ( apr-jun ) 2015 there were over 210,000 first time asylum applicants in the eu in those 3 months . 
  q3 ( jul-sep ) 2015 there were over 410,000 first time asylum applicants in the eu in those 3 months . 
  syrians are a small majority of those on the boats that would be turned around though . 
  europe should continue to take syrians directly from turkey . 
  people coming on the boats are from all sorts of countries and many of them are economic migrants . 
  turkey should request a tourist visa for migrants from north africa ( morocco , algeria & tunisia ), 
  uk to go from 64.8 million to 85.1 million people in 65 years ? 
  seems a bit low . 
  with more eastern european countries joining the eu , unlimited migration from africa , pakistan , india , bangladesh & commonwealth nations we 'll probably be 10-15million higher than that estimate . 
  the number of gaellic , anglo-saxon and celtic background people in britain will slip down considerably . 
  one in two children in the uk is born to someone born outside the uk . 
  immigrants make up 12 % of the current population and 50 % of the births . 
  yeah , we are . 
  but with less economic migrants . 
  wow , it 's like the british , canadians , australians and americans are doing basically ? 
  what is that island west of estonia ? 
  sweden will try their hardest , do n't you worry . 
  brunt of it *, 
  it 's less than 10 years if you go through swiss school system . 
  i grew up in vaud from 1998-2006 as a british citizen and was eligible for swiss citizenship . 
  only deterrence was cost . 
  [ 1 year in swiss school = 2 years towards citizenship . 
  ] ( http://lenews.ch/2015/04/22/7-step-guide-to-getting-a-swiss-passport/ ), 
  31km over the limit is way too excessive . 
  turks are n't white . 
  knugen !, 
  i do n't see it happening in the tradition sense of a federation . 
  it just does n't seem workable because we do have different cultures across the continent . 
  what i do see changing though is that slowly we will be become more understanding of other european countries be they in the eu or not . 
  prior to poland joining the eu most british people probably knew nothing of poles besides the few who came here post ww2 . 
  at first when a million arrived we were fearful and annoyed as a nation but we 've come to accept them , their work ethics , their mannerisms etc. 
  as freedom of movement continues to mix people together we will better understand what makes us different to one another and how to compromise . 
  no eu member looks even close to going to war with another eu member , just outsiders . 
  however there are economic differences between many of the nations and standards of living are quite different . 
  it would be harder to encourage brits & germans to move to bulgaria than to encourage bulgarians to move to britain & germany . 
  unless we significantly lower the wealth disparity between nations some nations will feel they give more than they get . 
  some also fear that to bring others up they must lower their own standard , which they naturally do n't want . 
  could n't they just take the money from the migrants and harvest their organs instead of transporting them across the country ? 
  population of riga has dropped 150 ' 000 ( ~ 20 % ) since 2000 . 
  if they do join the eu and eventually get freedom of movement & work i wonder how it will play out among different ethnic groups in bih . 
  croatia has yet to get freedom of movement & work but given that some countries can expect up to 20 years from application to accession i 'd imagine it would be possible for croatian people in bih to move to croatia enmasse in the future . 
  that being said it took croatia 9 years to go from application to full member . 
  perhaps there 's hope for accession before 2030 . 
  battle of aljubarrota is a fine example of the might of a combined english-portuguese force . 
  look at those odds !, 
  from the onset of the domesday book really . 
  people born on the british isles ? 
  eg 2 pakistanis have a child in britain , their child is british-pakistani and therefore a briton . 
  except they were born there in your case . 
  http://news.yahoo.com/us-urges-turkey-halt-syria-strikes-211448956.html us telling them to stop . 
  turkey is shelling syrian government controlled territory . 
  [ afp source ] ( https://twitter.com/afp/status/698600206997327872 ) [ timeturk source ] ( https://twitter.com/timeturk/status/698587870848794624 ), 
   if we 're arresting migrants that break the law and jailing/deporting them are you ? 
  they trapped dozens of people in a basement and killed them all indiscriminately . 
  even they did n't claim they were all terrorists this time . 
  edit : brigaded by turks , as anything on kurds on r/europe is . 
  most journalists conflate migrants , asylum seekers and refugees as just refugees . 
  he won a nobel peace prize for getting elected . 
  so what ? 
  governments of cyprus & greece went into people 's bank accounts and took money . 
  your money is n't safe in banks either .
