are you implying scotland will be better off within the uk and out of the eu ? 
  if so , why ? 
  it 's good to be skeptical , that 's how people can weigh up the pros and cons and come to the conclusion that despite pros and cons , eu membership is the exeter option and we want our country back . 
  i do n't want to be ruled by a tory government i have n't voted for . 
  we get to vote for our representatives in the eu . 
  and the eu has a lot less control over scotland than westminster does . 
  if we leave the uk we get to control our own affairs . 
  the eu are good . 
  the eu prioritises human rights and workers rights and all of the things . 
  the tories do n't do that . 
  we get to vote for our mep . 
  we did n't vote for the tories . 
  exactly , what harm is it for those to be in the eu ? 
  they do a good job making sure people 's rights are looked after . 
  westminster does not do that . 
  i trust the eu with those far more than i could ever trust theresa may or her governemnt with them . 
   nuclear policy would dissapear , foreign policy and military are going to be ever more centralised in the eu at accelerating rates . 
  aye , and we do n't want trident but we were never given a choice in the matter . 
  that is under westminster 's control . 
   fiscal policy is in a big way decided at a european level for eurozone countries ( which scotland would have to be ) and it will be even more if macron wins . 
  no , scotland gets to decide how to do this . 
  we have never had a choice on the matter before . 
   energy there 's some reluctance because the energy industry is quite big and wields a lot of lobbying power but sooner than latter we are going to be a energy union too . 
  well , we have oil , which is nothing to rely on . 
  however we are also a jutting outcrop on the windy north sea . 
  wind farms , perhaps . 
  we can utilise are energy for scotland far better than westminster utilising our energy output for the entire uk . 
  it 's a very simple concept . 
  you 're talking about all this lobbying and unions but it 's all speculation . 
  that is irrelevant to the issues scotland face around sovereignty at the moment . 
  to put it into context , the eu controls worker 's rights , human rights , health and safety , fishing and agricultural policy , free trade and travel and the environment . 
  these will all go back to westminster after brexit and under the tories , it 's reasonable to assume that worker 's rights will quickly fizzle away . 
  westminster currently controls benefits , social security , military and nuclear policy , foreign policy , immigration , fiscal policy , the economy , industry , employment , energy , domestic surveillance , the constitution and laws . 
  if we were to leave the uk we would have sovereignty over all of these issues , which westminster has complete control over right now and simply give the eu ` sovereignty ' over the stuff westminster want anyway . 
  their human rights and worker rights are not bad at all anyway . 
  they 're very good . 
  the tory track record , on the other hand ... well . 
  ... scotland will not do well out of brexit , it will give more control to westminster , which already have control over most things in scotland . 
  even if the eu were to broach federalising in the future , we still would have more sovereignty than remaining in the uk . 
  we democratically voted to stay in the uk so we could stay in the eu . 
  then the uk democratically voted to leave the eu . 
  this is not what we wanted and we did n't get a choice in the matter . 
  it 's no hypocrisy at all . 
  it 's the effects of westminster on scotland as a country . 
  we want democracy and staying in the uk does not give us this . 
  the eu wo n't impinge on our democratic decisions . 
  when we make democratic decisions via our elected parliament in holyrood the eu will no overturn them . 
  westminster does without a second thought because we do n't matter to westminster . 
  not as a whole anyway , only as a sum of parts essentially with no say . 
  i find that english people seem to be taking the move for scottish independence very personally . 
  we do n't want to be attached to a sinking ship who does n't even care about what we want . 
  we want to make our own decisions . 
  being part of the eu is one of those decisions . 
  the uk do n't care that we want to be members . 
  they know we do because they used it in their campaign against independence . 
  the eu never stopped westminster from doing what they want . 
  ** they ** !, 
  it 's actually ** me ** and ** my ** country men and women . 
  it 's not ** they ** . 
  it 's ** me ** . 
  ** i ** do n't want to be in the union anymore , same way ** you ** does n't want to be in the eu anymore . 
  why should n't ** i ** have a choice to decide ? 
  why do ** you ** get to decide that ** i ** leave one union but must stay in another ? 
  why ca n't ** we ** decide that ? 
  over representation in westminster means absolutely nothing . 
  it means nothing because the tories are in charge and ** they ** do what ** they ** fucking want to ** us ** . 
  it 's not a country though , is it ? 
  it 's four different states ruled by england . 
  i do n't want to be ruled by english tories . 
  so because you want to rule me and want me to leave the uk , i have to ? 
  where abouts in england are you , as a matter of interest ? 
   the uk can not prioritize scotland leaving over the well being of the rest of the country exactly . 
  scotland has to prioritise our own well being since westminster does n't give a flying fuck . 
  so an upheaval is not worth it because scotland is an inconvenience and westminster ca n't efficiently manage the civil service ? 
  what grounds are those ? 
  increased hassle for westminster because scotland is an inconvenience is not really good grounds at all . 
  they can still tell us to shut up and eat our cereal . 
  how would scotland leaving the uk harm the english ? 
  yes , they will have to . 
  that is how section 30 will be brought before westminster . 
  aka , westminster ` democracy ' . 
  just like how everyone else wants the rest of the uk to hurry up and brexit so everyone can get back to the important things , like welcoming scotland into the eu as an independent country . 
   the only people we remember from 1000 years ago are our kings . 
  they at least did something worthwile , like established the state and such minor things . 
  nicola sturgeon . 
  nicola sturgeon !, 
  aye , i believe that 's true , although i 'm not very informed . 
  i trust the merits of both will be discussed , particularly in relation to our oil and fishing rights . 
  i have faith in our government . 
   as it stands , new member states must agree to join the euro once requirements are met , croatia has agreed to joining the euro eventually , and schengen as well . 
  has n't poland made such an agreement and sort of refused to join the euro . 
  as i see it there is scope . 
  perhaps that may be something to be negotiated , particularly as we are currently a member who does not currently use euro . 
   i just really want scotland to have a say , be it inside or outside the uk ( though it seems like the uk is going more and more against scottish will ) . 
  i just wonder if scotland would prefer to join the eu or the efta based on the requirements of the eu . 
  we do n't have a say within the uk . 
  they could n't be clearer . 
  i just hope we do n't fuck the referendum up this time !, 
  sturgeon officially says she wants to rejoin the eu , although i imagine the merits of both will be discussed when the time comes , right after the next election results , i strongly hope . 
   ah yes , that 's what i 'd personally call victory aye .
