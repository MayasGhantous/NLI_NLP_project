  so , 72 inches distance ( 1.83 m ) ? 
  officer 's dress swords were more around the 32 - 33 inch mark , and had more of a curve in the 1700 's . 
  no , it 's not !, 
  bollocks !, 
  http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-45356262.html 1/2 a mile from a train station straight into leeds . 
  whole journey can be done in 45 mins . 
  there are thousands of houses like this all round the country . 
  our house was # 92,000 for a red brick cottage . 
  15 min drive into sheffield . 
  there 's no housing crisis for most of the uk . 
  just a lack of decent jobs . 
  but a couple in most northern cities can both earn # 20k , buy a house in their early 20 's and have kids before they 're 30 . 
  quite easily . 
  it just depends what your aspirations are . 
  and that the bullet is n't likely to go through a person , a brick wall , and then into someone else ... 
  especially in hollowpoint , the 9mm tends to stay in its target . 
  police forces are often given less powerful loads for this reason . 
  i do it with leak/onion and celery as well , plus some rosemary !, 
  does that make me middle class ? 
  because we 're still paying the membership fees ... 
  though i agree , from a sense of democratic , ` gentleman-like ' conduct , it 's not really cricket . 
  except the ` countries ' of the uk are n't sovereign , and ca n't act unilaterally on the plane of international law . 
  which is what the eu means when it refers to a ` country ' . 
  it really depends on what your definition of a ` country ' is - i.e. 
  strict legal principles , or less strict ` social ' definitions . 
  the uk usage is more akin to the german word ` land ' . 
  i agree - if we 're going by strict definitions , * the whole of the uk * should be blacked out . 
  it 's a map of states , not jurisdictions . 
  it 's a bit of an all-or-nothing thing ... 
  seriously !? 
  who weighs it , the binmen ? 
  seems a bit mean for families with young children ... 
  but i suppose it must function as a decent incentive !, 
  absolutely !, 
  and many are a tad bigger than that . 
  one of my favourite designs is a row of four-flour terraced townhouses , but the ground floor is a garage . 
  it solves 2 problems : 1 ) off-road parking in dense areas , and 2 ) it raises the living area above eye-level . 
  i know a lot of people who are really put off by the idea of a house being directly adjacent to the pavement , because people can walk right by your living room window . 
  if the window is 7 foot above ground level , that 's problem ( almost ) solved !, 
  it 's not just about the amount of space , it 's about the quality of it . 
  but we built * thousands * of buildings out of bricks , for decades . 
  workers ' terraced houses are now some of the most popular starter homes , and command a bit of a premium , compared to high-rise flats . 
  they feel like actual homes !, 
  small , yes , but you can get up to 1000 sq ft ( 92 sq. 
  m ) if you use the attic space as a third bedroom . 
  maybe even a bit of a garden !, 
  or at least a small yard to sit in and hang your washing .

  presuming 10g a coin , then about $ 300 in silver value . 
  not sure how many shekels someone would have earnt a day 1900 years ago , though ... 
  not always , in some dialects . 
  where i 'm from , ` too ' is the same as ` two ' , but ` to ' is often pronounced as an ` u ' ( like in the word ` up ' ) , or simply as a schwa . 
  quite different . 
  well , my exams were in french ... 
  i 'd 've struggled to pass them without it !, 
  my french was n't awful to start with , but i learnt a shit load while i was there . 
  most impressive was this italian lad called ricardo . 
  he barely spoke a word of french when he arrived . 
  he became fairly fluent in about 5 months by sleeping with half the girls on campus ... 
  some of us also worked quite hard , and had to pass everything to complete our degree programmes at home ... 
  yep , i had to pass * all * of mine , and it was essential in order to be awarded my degree . 
  it 's just not true though , is it ... 2 and 3 bed brick terraces are * far * more popular than old concrete flats . 
  they feel more like ` homes ' . 
  a lot of cities are having to completely gut and redo the old flats , or simply just knock them down . 
  they were badly built , damp , soulless places . 
  by all means , keep a few examples to show what we did , but the majority can come down !, 
  where 's that ? 
  not park hill flats in sheff is it ? 
  i agree - i never said that using ` asian ' to mean east asia is ` wrong ' . 
  al these places are , after all , in asia :p i 'm merely pointing out that that using asia to mean the erstwhile-called ` orient ' is a new thing in british english . 
  the police ic codes have ` asian ' and then a separate box for ` chinese ' and other parts of asia . 
  it 's also done like that on most official ethnicity forms . 
  that 's how it was always used when i was growing up !, 
  we 've never had a massive east asian population in the uk , and the use of ` asian ' to mean chinese/korean etc can only really have come from us media , because it 's not been pushed by any mainstream british sources . 
  even mainstream comics like romesh ranganathan and nish kumar refer to themselves as ` asian ' . 
  it 's just how it ' always been . 
  and that 's perfectly fine ; it 's all asia after all . 
  i 'm just pointing out that , in british english , asian has primarily meant south asia , as that 's been our main immigrant group ( until the poles  ) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_asian, 
  i mean it 's an american import * into british english * !, 
  the official police ethnicity codes puts ` asian ' as south asia - chinese and ` other ' is a separate category . 
  we have the ` british asian ' radio network that caters for pakistanis and bangladeshis . 
  it 's been this way for decades . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_asian the traditional way of saying east asians in british english was ` orientals ' . 
  the reason on reddit you 're seeing young britons using ` asian ' to mean china and neighbouring countries is because of american tv and film . 
  the usage is very recent . 
  i meant that the use of ` asian ' in the uk to mean ` east asian ' is an americanism - it makes sense for the us to use it that way !, 
  but it 's not a thing that 's happened in the uk till very recently , because ( like you said ) our immigrant population from east asia has been minimal . 
  then you either spend too much time around americans , or you 're not actually british . 
  ` asian ' where i live means south asia , full stop . 
  it 's the official definition for the census and police ethnicity codes . 
  in my neck of the woods ( yorkshire ) ` asian ' means south asian . 
  it 's also done that way on official police ethnicity charts . 
  using it to mean ` east asia ' is an americanism . 
  made perfect sense to me , and i 'm english ... 
  it could be a more elegant sentence , but there 's nothing grammatically wrong with it . 
  i tend to be suspicious of beers being sold ultra-cold - makes me think they 're trying to hide something !, 
  and yes , we make some decent beers !, 
  though i feel there 's recently been a trend ( probably copying the americans ) of hopping the shit out of them . 
  i 'd give it a few years for micro-brewers to get it out of their systems , and find a nice balance :p germany tends to make lagers ( good ones !, 
  ) , so i get why they 'd be cold .
