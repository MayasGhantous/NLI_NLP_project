  but for the roma , it 's whole communities that just ca n't seem to lift themselves out of tribal practices that result in neglect , abuse , and deprivation . 
  and ` harm ' can constitute the ` apprehension of harm ' . 
  the legal definition for assault . 
  see r v ireland ( 1998 ) . 
  heavy breathing down a telephone on multiple occasions constituted a criminal offence under s. 47 of the offences against the person act . 
  i 'll admit , this would be pretty hard to prosecute if the threat were made to a large group ; the threat does have to credible , with a an apprehension of ` immediate ' harm . 
  defamatory libel was in fact a criminal offence in england & wales until 2010 !, 
  though rarely prosecuted . 
  veteran 's day ? 
  nothing to do with the uk , mate ... 
  if they 're complaining about veteran 's day in the us by burning poppies in the uk , then they 're more stupid than i thought !, 
  it 's armistice day . 
  the americans have a great idiom for this : ` casing the joint ' . 
  i suppose you could use maps to have a good look around for people without alarms , or unsecured side windows . 
  then again , you could just do this in a van , and go around pretending you 're a bit lost . 
  there are thousands of well-built affordable houses in the uk outside of south east england and a couple of middle class hotspots dotted around the country . 
  seriously , just look at somewhere like pontefract in yorkshire on rightmove . 
  you can get 3-bed houses with a garden within walking distance of the station for about # 100k . 
  housing is n't expensive in the uk - it 's getting a house in a fashionable area where there are plenty of well-paying entry-level jobs for graduates that 's a challenge . 
  mobile phone tarrifs , however - very reasonable all over the country !, 
  nothing - our free movement relationship with ireland is bound by separate treaties between the uk and ireland . 
  ireland get a pretty good deal out of it . 
  they 're on the list of countries whose citizens can run to be members of our parliament and vote in our national elections . 
  the reverse is not true . 
  any hiccoughs caused to standard trading relationships between the uk and ireland could be quite easily solved by a few decent lawyers over a few business lunches . 
  and the british . . 
  gay applies to men * and * women ... 
  gay applies to men * and * women ... 
  i know ... 
  but do you not see the slightly humourous hypocrisy after a wall of text about the virtues about holding onto words ' etymology in their orthography ? 
  just made me smile , that 's all !, 
  if you 're happy with ` hiccup ' , then you should equally be happy with something like ` maneuver ' instead of ` manoeuvre ' ? 
  if so , your whole ` oui/huit ' argument loses its conviction a tad ... 
  would n't it be nursery * and * reception ? 
  this is genuinely how i do it !, 
  ( i 'm british ) . 
  i use french to figure out which ` desert/dessert ' i need !, 
  i also do the same with principal/principle . 
  if i can say ` principe ' in french , then it 's spelt ` principle ' i 'm english . 
  and manoeuvre ` man - oeuvre ' . 
  the americans butchered that word !, 
  hiccough , 
  * hiccough !, 
  it 's a ` high cough ' !, 
  oh , the irony , 
  they 've done far more than drop the ` i ' in colour !, 
  they 've got rid of the etymology of the words . 
  encyclopaedia , mediaeval , diarrhoea , manoeuvre , analogue , centre etc. . . 
  these words retain the spelling forms from their original languages - the americans have eroded this etymology . 
  jesus christ , people really are n't getting what you 're saying !, 
  i agree with what you 're saying . 
  we ca n't convict someone of a crime * here * for something that is n't a crime elsewhere . 
  i mean , we can ... and lots of laws * do * apply elsewhere . 
  if you murder someone in antarctica , then come back to britain , you can still be done for it . 
  but i agree with you - if we allow social care intervention from the moment they arrive on our soil , then we should n't be looking to prosecute for something that was legal in their own country . 
  obviously if there 's evidence of continued sexual contact over here , then that 's a different matter . 
  france also allows marriages at 14 with judicial consent ... 
  i studied french family law in france . 
  i was also rather surprised !, 
  andorran law is based on and heavily draws from its neighbours . 
  a better one would be moving to the uk , where we absolutely do n't allow marriage under 16 !, 
  you do know * our * country does n't universally support gay marriage , right ? 
  we always forget the northern irish !, 
  yes , though this generally refers to * early * pubescence , rather than * pre * pubescence . 
  most 13 and 14-year-olds would probably fall into this category , but there are plenty of 15 and 16-year-olds ( mainly girls , as they develop slightly quicker ) who are nigh on fully sexually mature . 
  does n't mean that an adult taking advantage of a 15-year-old 's lack of * emotional * maturity is n't predatory and despicable , but to criminalise the act * per se * just reeks of puritanism and a complete lack of understanding of how teenagers develop . 
  i like my jurisdiction 's ( england & wales ) approach to the matter . 
  whilst the age of consent is nominally set to 16 , the sexual offences act comes with quite a robust prosecution guideline , written * by government * , on the advice of parliament . 
  from the parliamentary guidance on section 9 of the sexual offences act 2003 , ` sexual activity with a child ' : `` in deciding whether it is in the ** public interest to prosecute ** this offence , where there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction , prosecutors may take into consideration factors which include ** the age and emotional maturity of the parties ** , whether they ** entered into the sexual relationship willingly ** , any ** coercion or corruption by a person ** , the relationship between the parties and whether there was any existence of a ** duty of care or breach of trust ** . 
  the discretion of the cps not to charge where it is not in the public interest would be particularly relevant where the two parties were close in age , ** for instance an 18 year old and a 15 year old , and had engaged in mutually agreed sexual activity . 
  ** '' i.e. 
  these laws are n't there to be officiously applied * wherever * the criteria are met they are there as weapons for the prosecutors and the police , so that when there * is * evidence of abuse or predatory behaviour , there 's actually a law in place that can be used to achieve justice and remove harmful people from society . 
  there are plenty of young teenagers in perfectly loving and safe sexual relationships . 
  criminalising them as rapists is just ridiculous . 
  i believe it 's 18 if there 's a position of power , like a teacher or councillor , but i 've never heard of such a general romeo and juliet clause in french law . 
  i studied french law in france , and whilst i did n't take criminal law , i went through all the major sexual offences with a friend to help him revise . 
  i do n't remember a thing about the age of consent being 15 only for children . 
  obviously , if you can quote the law i 'm ignorant of , je mangerai mon chapeau ... 
  well , it can ... 
  it just needs to pass a law that says : ` steve in accounts can veto any speeding ticket he wants to ' . 
  that 's parliament 's prerogative . 
  we really * do * have a separation of power in the uk ... 
  the concept was one of the main reasons for : 1 ) renaming the judicial branch of the house of lords as the ` supreme court ' , and moving the judges across the road to a different building , and 2 ) changing the role of the lord chancellor in 2005 . 
  before then , the lord chancellor ( now michael gove ) was in the government 's cabinet , * and * was head of the judiciary !, 
  it 's a constitutional debate that went on for over a century !, 
  they also added a new name - ` justice secretary ' - to make it * look like * the lord chancellor no longer can interfere with judicial affairs . 
  the westminster system is pretty much * built * on the concept of the separation of powers !, 
  we had to do that because treaties do n't have direct effect under the uk constitution . 
  our highest tier of legislation is a regular law . 
  the french constitution , for example , has an article guaranteeing the direct effect of international treaties where they create personal rights and obligations . 
  before the human rights act , there was no way to challenge a british law or administrative decision against echr jurisprudence without going to strasbourg with it . 
  hardly * anyone * had the means or funds to do this . 
  and even if strasbourg * did * tell the uk off , there was no enforceable mechanism for getting the law/decision altered . 
  putting it into law was pretty much our only option if we wanted to see the convention enforced in the uk . 
  odd ... 
  within the uk the yorkshire accent ( of which sheffield is a subset ) often comes up as one of the most comforting and trustworthy . 
  you really dislike it more than brummie ? 
  when i lived in france , ` bonne journ\u00e9e ' seemed to be the farewell of choice - especially when leaving shops or bars . 
  ` au revoir ' seemed a little too much . 
  never could get on with ` ciao ' .
