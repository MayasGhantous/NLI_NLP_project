  probably because in english it 's an * immensely * middle class thing to do . 
  as is doing the ` bises '  very bourgeois for us !, 
  i 'm a native-speaker ... 
  i never say ` i 'm good ' . 
  i 'd say ` i 'm well ' . 
  however , i do say ` i 'm fine/alright ' , which are both adjectives . 
  no-one would bat an eyelid . 
  just a dialect thing . 
  ` i 'm good ' sounds * really * american to me , but i know a lot of southern brits say it . 
  ( just thought , ' a lot of ' should n't be used with a non-count noun , but it sounds perfectly natural to say it !, 
  it 's become an accepted speach pattern ) . 
  bit petty ... 
  pretty sure taiwan * would * count as south-east asia were it not for the political sensitivities . 
  southeast asia is usually counted as sovereign states south of china . 
  most people consider taiwan to not be part of china any more ... 
  being liberal means believing in the free market and maximising personal autonomy . 
  does n't mean you have to actively support any sort of progressive agenda . 
  a liberal 's mantra would be ` it 'll sort itself out , leave it be ' . 
  but , she is mrs merkel ... she 's married . 
  it 's common for our news to use formal appellations . 
  we do the same with our own chancellor and other countries 's politicians . 
  ` mr obama ' is a common one . 
  thought it was 6 months ... 
  confirmed by the ` collins ' judgment . 
  and it can be extended where there 's proof of a genuine chance of being engaged as an employee . 
  we have a housing shortage in the south of england . 
  we have plenty of houses in the rest of britain ( barring a couple of rich enclaves ) , and at very cheap prices !, 
  good luck finding a decent-paying job though , unless you have years of industry or managerial experience ... 
  do n't be a dummy !, 
  well , there you go !, 
  i read a lot of french , and i do n't think i 've seen this before . 
  so is that the order that would be given to order troops to fire ? 
  that 's not the word for ` fire ' in this context though , is it ? 
  thought it was ` tirer ' ... 
  in some english dialects , they are n't actually the same . 
  same north england dialects put the ` y ' in . 
  ` thee-yuh ' . 
  then again , some of them also put the ` y ' in ` there ' and ` their ' , so it 's hardly helpful ... 
  do n't think they mean ` informed ' . 
  from my knowledge of french , i think they 're transliterating the italian word for ` computerised ' . 
  ` it-savvy ' . 
  they 're saying the italians do n't use technology much . 
  ` computer-literate ' , ` it-savvy ' , ` technologically-advanced ' would all be okay translations . 
  whilst ` informatised ' should technically work in english , it 's just not used . 
  i lived in nancy for a year !, 
  similar sort of place . 
  industrial but with some nice 18th century architecture , good bars , couple of good parks . 
  not too expensive either !, 
  highly recommend as somewhere that probably would n't be on your list , but is very pleasant !, 
  might be true that we brits see them as ` nations ' in the cultural sense , but they are still below that nation-state level . 
  scotland/wales are not ` countries ' in the same way e.g. 
  germany is . 
  the only equivalent is the uk in legal terms . 
  i love to see them included , but for fairness ' sake it is a bit off , seeing as many catalonians feel the same way about their ` region ' . 
  they see it as a nation within a larger state , just like wales within the uk . 
  if we keep making exceptions , as completely legitimate as they may be , it makes the task of putting together a list of ` countries ' very difficult , and open to accusations of political bias . 
  the only fair way to do it is to ask ` who gives out the passports ? 
  ' , and use that . 
  it 's more objective . 
  i studied law at university - if i 'd written ` country ' for england , scotland , etc without a qualification . 
  i 'd have got a red mark next to it . 
  they 're historical nations , but not ` countries ' in the modern sense of ' a nation-state with internationally agreed sovereignty ' . 
  i agree that culturally we see them as ` countries ' , but so do the catalonians with catalonia !, 
  functionally , they 're much more like provinces/states . 
  england does n't even have its own government ... 
  the word ` country ' used to be used like the germans use the word ` land ' - the uk has just kept up the use of the old definition because we never had a ` nation-state ' revolution like other european nations . 
  we actually rebuilt it after wwii !, 
  to the exact same blueprints from 100 years previously ... 
  the british legislative chambers are definitely the most ` different ' on that entire list . 
  a lot of the other ones look pretty interchangeable - there 's no mistaking ours !, 
  it 's built around a concept of adversarial debate between two main parties , not around a system of co-operation . 
  our court system is very similar - adversarial advocacy !, 
  true , but you 've used lethal force regardless . 
  if this were a civilian case , it 'd be at least attempted murder . 
  potentially murder if it could be shown that the pilots ' being shot by rebels was a naturally predictable outcome of downing the plane . 
  but whatever , nato 'll give them a slap on the wrist . 
  the russians will probably keep it as a bargaining chip to use later on when they want something . 
  probably not the uk . 
  knots are used for air and boat travel . 
  though i expect if we were writing a report to another country we 'd put both , but a lot of us/uk-led international treaties define borders and jurisdictions in nautical miles . 
  the us does n't use imperial , they use us custom . 
  there are a several minor but very distinct differences . 
  sort of - in my variety of english , the ` a ' becomes a schwa . 
  then again , so does pretty much every other vowel , so it 's hardly unusual ... 
  yup !, 
  and although we 've come to standardise a lot of how english is written ( or , at least , every country has its own system , though we still dispute things ) , silent letters and intrusive consonants are basically un-learnable for foreigners without living in the place for years . 
  in my native north of england , we drop the ` h ' from the beginning of words all the time . 
  this means when speaking quickly words get left out , but other letters get put in to ease pronunciation . 
  ` we need to find an ` otel ' ( hotel ) . ', 
  it makes sense - the french do n't pronounce the ` h ' either , and that 's where the word 's from . 
  i would n't write it like that - i 'd put ' a hotel ' , but that 's not how i 'd say it colloquially . 
  but we do the same with other letters - ` when we get to ' airport , we need to ring the y' otel . ', 
  a faint ` y ' gets put in to prevent a glottal stop before ` hotel ' , but a glottal stop is used to replace the word ` the ' altogether . 
  we also have a thing called an ` intrusive r ' . 
  we normally do n't pronounce ` r ' after a vowel . 
  in british english ` fetter ' and ` feta ' are pronounced identically . 
  as are ` law/lore ' , ` caught/court ' etc. . . loads of them !, 
  * except * where a vowel follows . 
  ` for better or worse ' would be ` fuh bettuh r ` aw wuhse ' . 
  the only pronounced ` r ' is the one at the end of ` better ' !,
