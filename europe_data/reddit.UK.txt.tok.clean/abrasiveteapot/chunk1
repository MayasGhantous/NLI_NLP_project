yeah that sounds like an australian . 
  south africans and australians tend to be rather blunt ( like the dutch and germans ) , more so than politely passive aggressive like the british . 
  on the other hand the friendly part is a willingness to chat to strangers anywhere . 
  it 's a long list of those who hate the english :-), 
  yeah we got french in primary ( qld ) , then french italian or german in secondary ( northern nsw ) . 
  they offered indonesian for one year but no one wanted to do it . 
  yeah working holidays visas are reciprocal between oz , nz , uk , canada and some parts of europe ( definitely sweden france and netherlands , i think there are more though ) . 
  absolutely . 
  until ww2 there was a huge irish population - many of the convicts were irish , plus a lot of free settlers in the 1800s for economic reasons ( not just the famine , but that was a big one ) also the gold rush . 
  40,000 irish convicts alone . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_australians after ww2 oz had a huge wave of italians , greeks and central europeans . 
  the kiwis argue about the invention of the flat white ( and also the pavlova ) both oz and nz claim them . 
  yeah , i get asked if i 'm south african as well ( aussie accent ), 
  what 's wrong with pronouncing ko\u015bciuszko as cozzie-osko ? 
  huh ? 
  bloody hell , beat the dutch by 20 years , well done !, 
   on a serious note , i 'm actually curious how this will play out for industries that require low skilled workers ( in the uk ) . 
  i ca n't imagine they 'll do well , they 're currently importing large numbers of central/east europeans for a reason , if the flood of willing workers stops i 'm not sure what they 'll do . 
  i ** assume ** the reason they preference eu workers is that uk workers do n't want to do the work , but i do n't know that to be true . 
  i guess they 'll either have to pay higher wages and pass the cost on or go out of business -, 
  i think most of our cherry pickers are romanians and bulgarians are n't they ? 
  our farmers wo n't be pleased :-), 
  but our govt keeps saying they want free trade without free people movement ( 2 of the 4 freedoms ) that 's referred to as cherry picking from the freedoms, 
  late 60s, 
  oh , ok , yeah very aware of soviet resettlement and the problems it caused , it just did n't read that way . 
  thanks, 
  indeed , corrected, 
  ahh ok , i was n't sure . 
  cheers . 
  not guilty your honour . 
  a francophile yes , french , no . 
  i wish , then i would n't have to worry about brexit . 
  i had a similar conversation to this one on / r/france recently where my ( incorrect ) english style word order was noted as `` cute '' ( and gave me away as a foreigner - although given how bad my french is that was n't exactly a sherlock holmes level deduction ) . 
  the philipines has some amazing places boracay is fairly well known but there are a bunch of others . 
  thailand is great too . 
  hell you can have fun in most parts of south east asia . 
  < applause  i am simply chuffed that you considered my opinion worth enquiring of . 
  to be honest that 's not the first place aussies go for a beach - there 's plenty in oz , but to go overseas it 's more bali ( indonesia ) and the pacific islands, 
  perhaps , given that you 're famed for your beaches and known as a popular place for brits to holiday , aussies are n't going there because we have plenty of both those at home :-), 
  agreed ... but . 
  it seems only really grammatical in context of rebutting a previous sentence ( in my non expert but native speaker * opinion * ) . 
  / u/alimbiquated posted it as ( presumably ) an example of a wording that while valid unnecessarily uses an `` ing '' form when a better wording exists . 
  thank you by the way , you 've just pinned what was weird - it 's the tenses . 
  if you want to say that `` you will in the future '' be going to work , you would say `` i will be going to work every day '' as opposed to `` i am '' ( now ) going to work every ( future ) day ( temporal clash ) . 
  it was hard to unpick because `` every day '' could be any time period depending on context . 
  the `` am '' in the rebuttal version above is an affirmative not a statement of present time situation . 
  english speaking-wise i 've worked in the us , uk , australia , singapore and the philipines . 
  not sure i understand your point though . 
  i 'm the one arguing `` have you any plans later '' sounds perfectly normal and acceptable to me . 
  did you mean to respond to / u/cesaragus ? 
  no , i 'd more likely say `` do you have a brother ? '', 
  but yes the `` have you an x '' is n't seeming awkward to me . 
  it feels a lot more natural in the `` have you plans later '' example than the `` brother '' example , but i would n't notice it as unusual if someone said `` have you a brother '' . 
  i 'm not sure the us/british split is as clear as you suggest - the northern uk dialects retain more usage of germanic sourced words ( got / gotten ) as the preferred wordings whereas received pronunciation seems to preference french derivatives ( note : opinion linguists feel free to jump in ) . 
  ie the `` posher '' you are , the more likely you are to say `` have you plans later '' than `` y' got plans then ? '', 
  i 'm an australian in uk so perhaps my dialect is muddled :-), 
   it got to the point where i do n't really know any more myself as to what is right . 
  yeah , i know what you mean , i 'm getting a little that way too !, 
  in some ways it 's hard because there can be many `` right '' answers too . 
  the second is fine . 
  the first is subtly `` off '' but i 'm not sure why . 
  edit ahh that first construct is really for using with an emphasis on the `` am '' ( as an implied rebuttal of a negative - `` i do n't care what you say . 
  i am going to work every day '' as opposed to `` i work every day '' or `` i 'll be working every day '', 
  it 's `` workplace '' level of formal , not `` meet the queen '' level of formal . 
  so yeah , probably only said at pubs in the right parts of chelsea or kensington when one is wondering whether going to the club or home is the better choice . 
   in british english you would normally ask ` have you got any plans later ? ', 
  as opposed to ` have you ... ? 
  interesting , i would n't say that , i 'd say ` have you got any plans * for * later ? ', 
  i 'm no linguist but the `` got '' without the `` for '' sounds wrong . 
  sorry ca n't tell you what rule it is breaking if any . 
  although mind you , after having read the phrase 57 times now , i think i 'm also more likely to say `` have you any plans for later '' rather than `` have you any plans later '', 
  agreed, 
  that 's a surprise , there 's bloody aussie backpackers everywhere in europe , you ca n't go to a hostel or pub without tripping over them . 
  now i * know * you 're southern european and not british !, 
  :-) ok , but no kissing dammit . 
  perhaps it 's because i 'm probably older than reddit 's median age ( although the european forums seem to be a little more mature than some of the american dominated ones ) but in australia and uk nobody would blink at it although it 's perhaps a little more formal , you 'd more likely say it in the office than at the pub i suspect . 
  mind you the australian would more likely say `` ya got plans t ` morra ? 
  we 're having a barbie at the beach , ya comin ' ? '', 
  the * best * kind of right hey ? 
  ok , a bront\u00eb sisters novel then, 
  i 'm irritable so some of it is me , but your wording implies that i 'm excusing the educated middle class from being in any way participants . 
  i did n't and would n't , but the numbers are an order of magnitude different . 
  snobbery and not being nice is n't a hate crime . 
  middle class remain suburbs are n't hotbeds of race hatred . 
  let 's just say a little from each and we 'll move on ? 
  you 're preaching to the choir mate , i 'm not and did n't try to argue hate crimes are n't up . 
  they are and it 's an abomination . 
  what you wo n't see is them occurring in a physical way in middle class suburbs ( remembering that it can be less than a kilometre from posh to council estate ) . 
  as for snooty middle class mums being shits yeah no surprise , as an immigrant i get it , but that 's the english class system at play more than anything . 
  anyway , if you 're looking for someone to argue with by trying to misrepresent , i 'm outta here . 
  my kids are at primary school right now , and yes they are `` taught another language '' , note the quotation marks . 
  they 're getting taught a couple of phrases in german and french , it 's probably a couple of hours a term . 
  compare that to european schools and it 's hardly surprising uk kids mostly have limited foreign language skills ( except those who are raised by bilingual parents of course ) . 
   `` have you any plans later ? '', 
  does n't really sound natural now , outside of victorian literature . 
  really ? 
  til i live in a jane austen novel . 
   yeah , the shock is in the numbers not really , wilders and lepen are at about 35 % of the vote iirc , and that 's about the percentage of the population who voted leave ( 70 % turn out and half voted leave ) too many people abstained . 
  most of the hate crime against immigrants is n't happening in places like tunbridge wells , it 's happening in the rougher suburbs where recent poorer immigrants live - places like croydon where a refugee got bashed . 
  i think you 'll find that the locals in middle class parts of kent and surrey are quite happy about the poles , they get better more reliable tradesman at a cheaper price .
