  my milk is 3.408 litre ( 6pints ) i just checked . 
  edit come to think of it , the 450ml is the pissy american pint , we have proper 568ml pints in britain , do n't try to short change a brit on his beer !, 
  yes , exactly what i 'm referring to , soixante-dix as seventy and four twenties plus 10 for 90 ( quatre vingt et dix is that right ? ), 
  damn !, 
  you win . 
  i 'd much rather you cloggies came and did a modern version of the glorious revolution and replaced our leadership with yours again . 
  that mr rutte seems much nicer than the wicked witch of the west we currently have in power . 
  that glass is half full , hey ? 
  :-) fair enough . 
  i would think it increases the likelihood of confusion myself , but hey , i see a half empty glass !, 
  not to mention a space shuttle, 
  we 're schizoid in the uk in so many ways . 
  part of entering the eu was that we had to go metric , but got some explicit exclusions , so we still use miles for road distances ( only ) , pints for beer and milk . 
  everything else is metric ( timber , nuts and bolts etc ) all food is measured in kg as the primary and you can add any additional markings you wish , so some food ( like prepackaged mince at the supermarket ) is sold as 454g ( 1lb ) and milk is 568ml ( 1 pint ) . 
  even when the ukippers die off who care about it it 'll still probably keep being used out of low care factor, 
  and given subway `` foot longs '' are often not a foot long ( they got sued over it ) the couple mils difference between 30cm and a foot is with their margin of error anyway . 
  ** officially ** the uk does n't but miles , pounds and pints are everywhere still . 
  i grew up with metric so i 'm constantly converting . 
  and base 20 remnants, 
  seconded . 
  the downvote waves are illogical sometimes . 
  wow , great inability to read , you missed this bit  they ca n't leave at any time of their own choosing and there is only one destination that australia will allow : back to whatever war torn shithole they ran away from in fear of their life . 
  i can only assume you did n't read the rest either , good night . 
  we were talking about manus , not nauru ... which is in the middle of nowhere with no routes off other than what australia chooses to provide . 
  so , no . 
  your understanding is fundamentally flawed i 'm sorry . 
  it 's not a case of australia kindly providing a refuge , a temporary place of sanctuary for protecting war refugees at all . 
  it 's a deliberate cynical ploy to avoid fulfilling the terms of a treaty we signed in the 50s , which requires us to accept any genuine refugees who enter our legal jurisdiction ( un convention on refugees ) . 
  here 's how it goes : refugee escapes war zone and flies into indonesia ( almost always , because a ) the distance from the edge of indon territory to oz territory is comparatively small by sea , and b ) it 's well serviced by airlines ) , he gets to a port serviced by a people smuggler who extracts $ 10s of thousands to cram him into a rickety boat ( usually a worn out fishing vessel , because they often get destroyed ) , the game is to successfully sail it into australian waters so they can claim asylum , given 90 % + usually are successfully able to prove refugee status under the treaty , if they achieve this they 're on an easy route to australian citizenship . 
  the australian forces try to intercept the boats while they 're in international waters , if they did they sent them to manus ( until it was shut down by courts as illegal the other month ) , they do n't get to apply for asylum because they 're in png which is n't a signatory . 
  they ca n't leave at any time of their own choosing and there is only one destination that australia will allow : back to whatever war torn shithole they ran away from in fear of their life . 
  in several cases australia has refused to ship them to countries that have offered to take them . 
  they ca n't leave the camp , they 're under armed guard , even if they could , there is nowhere for them to go , manus is an island hundreds of miles off the coast of png which itself is mostly undeveloped wilderness , you ca n't swim off , and even if they had money few of the locals have boats you could get to the mainland on . 
  now the argument for such harsh treatment is that there are dozens of countries they could claim asylum in between syria and australia so therefore they deserve to be raped , to die of basic illnesses that are easily treated and etc. 
  i personally think that is an evil mindset , you seem to differ . 
  i hope you sleep well . 
  i 'm not going to try and change your mind . 
  only if australia chooses to convey them there , they have no agency or ability to do so at their own choosing . 
  you get the idea of an island in the middle of nowhere , one of the poorest regions in one of the least developed countries in the world ? 
  you ca n't stroll down to the train station and catch the 705 to new jersey . 
  they 're in a camp secured by armed guards with no public transport that could get them out of there . 
  even the locals have limited means of getting to and from there to the rest of png . 
  it was just a long time ago for you guys !, 
  spain has exclaves in north africa as well , but yeah libya and many other african nations would be happy to receive a tenth of what erdogan was promised to do a whole lot more . 
   and is there policy for australia to prevent them from leaving . . ? 
  last i read about , no they do n't have such policy . 
  they do n't have to have a `` policy '' it 's an island , which is ** not part of australia ** , hundreds of miles from ** anything ** other than a couple of other smaller islands that make up a remote province of one of the least developed countries in the world . 
  they ca n't go anywhere given a ) you ca n't walk or swim your way off , b ) they 've exhausted their funds with people smugglers to get onto the boats from indonesia they were captured on before being shipped there . 
  c ) even if they had a million bucks burning a hole in their pocket they 're under armed guard like prisoners , they are n't allowed to just walk out of there . 
  it seriously does n't get a lot more remote than manus outside of maybe pitcairn island . 
  i seriously doubt your `` last i read about it '' you sound very much like someone making a bunch of assumptions without actually having read anything yet . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manus_province edit : just so we 're clear , australia has had for a decade a policy of offering a small amount of money and a free flight back to country of origin to asylum seekers in order to try and empty some of the camps . 
  when manus was declared illegal they upped the amount in hopes of getting takers . 
   yes , they can leave any time they want . 
  no they ca n't , we 're still talking about manus , right ? 
  they can only return if and when the australian govt agrees to ship them back ( noting that manus is part of png not australia so australia has no legal obligation to do a damn thing ) . 
   even syria has a lot of safe places oh ffs . 
  we 're talking about the refugees here not assad 's cousins , sure if you 're in the right clique i 'm sure damascus is still pretty damn fine . 
  being destitute in syria after you 've burnt all your savings to almost get to oz , then shipped back to a country you got the hell out of for good reason is n't going to go well . 
  no home , no job no money . 
  turn away , nothing to see here . 
  we can be fairly sure of this because we have plenty of actual case histories of what happens next ( and to the afghanis who got shipped back as well ) . 
  edit : you do understand that manus is an island , right ? 
  a dot on the map off the coast of papua new guinea , it has pretty much no links to anywhere available to them and it 's a little too far to swim given it 's hundreds of km to the png mainland ( and that landfall is heavy jungle ) . 
   yeah the difference is that they can leave anytime they want not really . 
  they have usually exhausted their funds getting there , so it 's a choice of a ) get sent back to syria or b ) rot in prison with no hope of an escape ( at least a prison has a finite sentence ) . 
  thanks . 
  i hope to visit russia some day :-), 
  yeah , evil , really . 
  people dead because they were denied basic medical treatment . 
  rapes by guards , no punishment . 
  beatings , solitary confinement . 
  child abuse . 
  no education facilities for the children . 
  etc etc. 
  this is a prison , not a refugee camp and if prisoners in australia were treated this way they would literally be breaking the law . 
  google it , there 's zillions of articles , here 's a starter based on 2mins effort : https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/17/revealed-year-long-campaign-to-make-conditions-harsher-for-manus-refugees https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/opinion/sunday/australia-refugee-prisons-manus-island.html?_r=0 https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/06/nauru-abuse-inquiry-did-not-interview-children-so-as-to-not-traumatise-them-further http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-14/png-police-respond-to-reports-of-shooting-at-manus-is-centre/8445274 http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/manus-island-detainee-class-action-begins/news-story/a79949d0033c75de5d813b9229051993 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/film-about-australian-refugee-detention-centres-screened-on-london-embassy http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/27/asia/manus-island-refugee-death-australia/index.html https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/05/amnesty-warns-any-company-taking-over-manus-and-nauru-camps-complicit-in-torture, 
  sure , but that 's just logistics and certainly not beyond a group of countries as rich as the eu and with so much maritime capability . 
  the real issue here is that there would be a storm of protest both physical and legal that would derail it . 
  and that is exactly why i prefer to be in the eu than an australian any longer , there 's still something vaguely resembling morals and ethics left in the place . 
  yes , there would be significant legal issues with implementing it for refugees already on european soil , but that 's not actually the australian model , the australian model is to sidestep the refugees legal rights by intercepting them before they set foot in australia ( or in this case europe ) and before they can claim asylum . 
  shipping the existing european based claimants to an african country would be illegal and require changes to any number of laws , i could n't imagine that ever getting successfully passed ( could be wrong of course ) . 
  good point . 
  i was n't op , but perhaps the idea with shipping them there was to pay lip service to the refugee convention ( they 're still technically in france ) , while removing them from europe proper ( just a guess ) . 
  of course it worked , being evil usually does in the short term edit evil enough to get a $ 70m damages payout https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/14/government-to-pay-damages-to-manus-island-detainees-in-class-action, 
  100000 refugees vs a million is merely a matter of logistics , shipping people out of one place to another place is n't hard . 
  the resistance and protests however would be ugly - hence it only really works when you do what australia did/does and divert them before landfall . 
   i do n't think appealing to morals will work on this subreddit i 'm afraid . 
  it seems , to me at least , very anti refugee . 
  oh , i was n't appealing to morals , i was merely pointing out that the eu ( to date ) have shown better morals than australia , they may not necessarily sustain that . 
   are you moving to the uk ? 
  already living here , qualify for citizenship shortly , however thanks to the gobsmacking amount of money it will now cost , and brexit , i 'm seriously thinking about upping camp and moving back into the eu ( probably ireland ) . 
  australian model works for them because they pay the 3rd world countries money to allow them to do so . 
  i 'm sure there 's a couple of dirt poor african states that would happily allow the eu to pay them to set up something as atrocious as manus island . 
  it 's not a case of pointless or not possible , it * is * the case that so far eu has more morals than australia and has chosen not to . 
  fortress eu is very possible though . 
  source : am australian , for a little bit longer . 
  australia deals with refugee immigration by capturing the boats outside australian waters and shipping them to camps in foreign 3rd world countries nearby ( manus island for example ) . 
  it allows them to avoid having to recognise their refugee status ( they 're a signatory to the un charter on refugees ) , if they do n't get into territorial waters they ca n't make their claim for refugee status . 
  nefarious way to get around the letter of the law .
