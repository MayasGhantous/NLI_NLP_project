  the restauranteur is making it up , i 've seen some awful nachos in uk and germany , but they all make a nod to the original concept of chips salsa and cheese . 
  yeah , while true , trump ** thinks ** the eu is paying the us 2 % of their gdp for nato , listen to what he says ( and tweets ) . 
  he thinks nato is an outsourcing arrangement . 
  lol , ** `` the queen '' ** - ` cos there can be only one !, 
  qe2 of uk and etc i assume you mean ? 
  ( denmark and etc have queens as well btw ), 
   is the defending chief cunt of the united kingdom . 
  with strong competition from farage, 
  an excellent start, 
   `` expat '' is a fancy word for western europeans who do n't intend to integrate . 
  < shrug  you say that like it contradicts what i just said . 
  there are plenty of people who immigrate with the intention of staying permanently who make little or no attempt to integrate either , and plenty of expats who assimilate quickly . 
  i do n't see how willingness to integrate is a differentiator when both groups do and do n't do it as for the example of the poles , if they 're staying short term then yeah , they 're expats by the definition , although amongst my polish friends most of them came intending to stay for a short time and then stayed a lot longer , until brexit i do n't think any of them were likely to go back ( a bit up in the air now ) . 
  this is the grey area that has no word attached - is an expat who came 35 years ago still an expat ? 
  given it 's about intention then technically yeah , if he says he wants to still return but you 'd have to wonder how much he really means it . 
  some people use the word incorrectly and then again some people use the word literally when they mean figuratively , i ca n't help that . 
  lol !, 
   white = expat  brown = immigrant expat - someone who moves to another country ** not ** intending to stay permanently immigrant - someone who moves to another country ** intending ** to stay permanently it is n't difficult to differentiate without making it about race . 
  yes there will be more white expats , because they are more likely to come from somewhere first world ( because most people describing themselves as expats tend to be highly skilled and moving temporarily for work purposes and intending to return ) . 
  does n't mean there are n't plenty of brown american or canadian expats ( for example ) working for a few years somewhere overseas but intending to return home to start a family . 
  i 'm a white immigrant to the uk , or at least i was until brexit , now i 'm suddenly an expat unless i can find an eu country who 'll take me . 
  yeah aired in australia too ( not austria ), 
  quote unquote, 
  where are they getting upset ? 
  in / r/australia they 've pretty much given him honorary citizenship , none of the aussies on here are moaning ( one or two cringing a little bit and that 's about it ) . 
  hell even the aussie broadcaster 's announcers were pretty mellow about it . 
  most of / r/australia wants to give him citizenship ... ie https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/6b0dfb/this_is_what_happens_when_australia_gets_to_be_in/dhizy8j/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=australia, 
  it 's a reference to swedish rape laws, 
  welcome to / r/europe which is n't one of the 50states the donald sub is over thataway do n't let the door hit you on the way out, 
  this atheist went and visited churches in poland when i was there , it 's an important part of their culture and history , of course you have to . 
  i do n't think the tories have any qualms about cutting the funds provided to scotland though ... 
  same result, 
  good to see some sensible analysis for a change , the putin bots always talk up the `` russia weak and inoffensive '' . 
  the above is exactly how it would go until the europeans finally `` bit '', 
  truth hurts , mr erdogan ? 
  as you posted below  as part of the audience , especially the german audience is not familiar with the concept of a first daughter , i 'd like to ask you your role how is that harsh ? 
  seems perfectly reasonable to me . 
  well he was a helluva good mass murderer , you have to give him that, 
  insufficient information ... where , when , who ? 
  you 're the one who needs to chill . 
  erdogan is the one threatening everyone left right and centre . 
  you 're a barely tolerated member of nato nowadays , it 's a shame , ataturk was a great man , he 'd be horrified to see what your current dictator has turned your country into . 
  i think the connection being russian activity in both instances ( not op , guessing ), 
  well , given the last 800years worth of english actions against the irish , i think the fact the two countries get on so well is remarkable . 
  the real threat is what happened to czechoslovakia in 1938 . 
  as we 've already seen in crimea , donbass etc. 
  everything short of an outright war coupled with strong attempts to destabilise nato/the eu ( funding lepen , farage , trump etc ), 
  nfi why the downvotes , you 're right the sun specialises in `` was n't necessary '', 
  and that 's an improvement on the poll in feb when they were level at 20 % each, 
  the shock is wearing off . 
  ouch !, 
  no it 's the poms who hate aussies . 
  the germans do n't hate us ( except in munich - and they have good reason for that , sorry about oktoberfest germany ), 
  i hope putin is paying you well . 
   i still wish the russians had democracy ) i think you missed me saying this above . 
  putin is a dictator . 
  why would i wish on the russian people the swapping of one dictator for another ? 
  i wish for them freedom and self determination . 
  if that 's a shitty way of saying `` have there been worse dictators in the world than putin '' ? 
  then sure , stalin for a start , but there 's a bloody long list of awful ones , pol pot , idi amin etc he is certainly not the worst dictator ever , but he still is one . 
  we can dislike putin and dislike evil oligarchs too ... 
  mind you , putin is one of the key reasons many of those oligarchs still have their money , he removed power and funds from any who stood against him , any that remain are in his thrall . 
  ( btw i do n't think putin is trying to make russia a hellhole , i think putin is doing what dictators do - consolidate power and try to ensure the longevity of his reign , he 's pretty damn good at it too . 
  there 's absolutely a case that there could be worse dictators of russia than vlad , but i still wish the russians had democracy ), 
  yes , it 's a good point . 
  putin could very well start ww3 , directly or indirectly , particularly given he seems to be keen on installing loose cannons into the leadership of the west . 
  having said that , i do n't actually think he will directly , he 's seems to be better than hitler was at pushing the envelope without quite getting to war ( then again many probably said the same in 1938/39 so maybe i 'm just overly optimistic ) . 
  probably because ericsson is often at the forefront of developing the new tech, 
  gbk in london have the same thing, 
  there 's going to be selection bias here because only people with an impressive list are going to answer , but here 's my modest list . 
  australia new zealand hong kong singapore thailand indonesia usa ( several states ) england wales scotland jersey france hungary spain norway finland sweden i think that 's everything, 
  euros is the currency of the eu m ^ 2 is square metres a measurement of area . 
  euros per square metre is therefore the cost of something per sq m the link above shows a building plan and tells us that it will be housing surface area : 1.375.000 m \u00b2 ( fuck me that 's big ) and the cost is 1950 euros/m \u00b2 so the total cost of the building is estimated to be $ 1950 * 1.375.000 = $ 2.681.250.000 note europeans use '' . '', 
  as a thousands separator not '' , '' as used in uk & us, 
  time to move to lithuania son . 
  there 's a helluva lot of teslas in norway , i see a few in london ( parked next to one today ), 
  opel is general motors . 
  so is vauxhall in the uk . 
  that 's actually a great explanation , thanks for the link, 
  entirely true , quite a few there and we also swiped words from everywhere , arabic , greek , persian , chinese , indian ( pick a dialect we 've borrowed from it ) etc etc, 
   it 's ok !, 
  english pronunciation is irregular at times . 
  the gs in `` geek '' and `` gem '' are different . 
  i do not know why . 
  because the words were stolen from different languages as i understand it . 
  the first one is 50km out of lisbon , which does n't match your stated criteria . 
  the second one i ca n't get that map to work properly on this device but if it 's anywhere in barcelona ( as it seems to be ) then go for it , barcelona has a strong economy and strong demand . 
  my undestanding was anything that cheap in close would be dodgy as , but , ymmv . 
  is it really that bad outside of stockholm ? 
  grape jam top ? 
  only for americans . 
  europeans are saying we do n't get that here ( or am i missing something obvious ? ), 
  you 're not going to get much in a major west european city for that . 
  i 'd suggest you either consider relaxing the country restrictions , or relax the locale or up the ante . 
  you could find a small house in a small village or town in rural spain for that , as you say places like galicia or andalucia are considerably cheaper than madrid and barcelona ( and their surrounds ) as their economies are weak . 
  alternatively you may be able to find something in central or eastern europe . 
  probably not warsaw krakow or prague but the baltics and balkans are still relatively cheap . 
  rural italy can be very cheap but you 'll struggle to rent it out . 
  lastly , think about borrowing another 50k - $ 100k should be enough to buy a small flat in lisbon , madrid or barcelona and the interest should be deductible against rental income . 
  london still - the waifs http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_emz0o638pq the aussie expat song :-),
