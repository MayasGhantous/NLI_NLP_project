  more latitude is given to officers and there is an expectation that they will be actively filtering . 
  a foot soldier is only expected to disobey the obviously unlawful ( ie shoot this unarmed person ) and not to question say , shelling a position . 
  an officer however would be expected to be sure that all available info suggests that it is a legitimate target ( for example ) . 
  i did n't want to bog down the primary point by differentiating the levels of adherence to command in the command structure !, 
  i do , and did appreciate it . 
  i am however well aware of how rarely the rest of the world gets it when we use dry humour , hence the edit to tone it down :-), 
  no because your ambassador to the eu is on record saying he wants the eu to break up . 
  because your president is on record saying that he sees no need for nato and that he likes the way putin operates . 
  those are actual facts , not alt-facts ( even if malloch did try the `` i was only joking '' defence ), 
  yeah , sorry about that . 
  i 'm glad i do n't get to hear the german equivalent . 
  the english chavs are bad enough . 
  yeah , that is looking a bit inevitable , is n't it ? 
  except that uk would never agree to give up command of its forces to the eu . 
  with the current isolationist viewpoint in govt it wo n't happen . 
  a lot would have to change for that to be acceptable . 
  no argument , i think it needs to be done . 
  trump ca n't be trusted and who know how long he 'll be in power . 
  europe should be able to defend itself without reliance on the americans . 
  my point was only that other eu countries would have good historical reasons to be leery of german military build up and that those concerns should not be dismissed , they should be carefully managed . 
  edit , sorry that sounded snippy . 
  thanks for that - i 've wasted far too much of this morning watching those clips :-) i had n't seen this one . 
  i agree - i would have expected it to be france as well . 
  lol . 
  british army will happily fight side by side with the eu , but the odds of them giving up command - near enough to zero . 
  there 's enough moaning about us command and active attempts to avoid it ( refer the way afghanistan and iraq were executed ), 
  indeed , although that 's not quite how they word it :-), 
  oops sorry , my bad , i can never remember where luxembourg is :-), 
  existing protocols already govern this , it had to be written into local laws and military rules in order for nato to work, 
  i do n't think there actually are luxembourgian troops are there ? 
  anyway , your example is both the hardest to resolve as well as the most unlikely , hard simply because luxembourg is ~ ~ on ~ ~ * near * both countries borders so deployment in the region is likely and deployment is the key tool for managing inappropriate usage . 
  the dutch get to say yes or no to ( for example ) deployment to donbass . 
  once there they 're under german command . 
  i think we can agree that will work ok , if there 's a reason to be there of course . 
  the `` firing on eu citizens '' thing should be covered by rules of war ( no officer will do that without coverage 40 ways to sunday ) firing on a hypothetical other eu member 's army , well , generally deployment control would have prevented the dutch being part of a german aggression , but in this hypothetical the only way the germans could legally be firing on another eu country 's military is if they are at war . 
  if they are not at war and it 's unilateral aggression then again rules of war mean commissioned officers of both countries would ( legally ) have the right to refuse to action it . 
  ** tl ; dr ** german army could n't legally engage another eu member 's army without a declaration of war . 
  officers have right and obligation to refuse to carry out an illegal order . 
  therefore both dutch and german officers should/would refuse to carry out the command . 
  edit . 
  luxembourg is on belgium / germany not dutch/german border , my bad . 
  point still remains that deployment control is first level of prevention , rules of war second level . 
  i 'm curious as to whether you think that 's a coincidence ? 
  i 'm proeu but a lot of my countrymen have drawn the parallel and extrapolated the end point ... 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  it needs to be handled very carefully as it could easily go wrong both perceptually and in reality.a lot of countries have historically good reasons to be concerned about german mikitary build up , but given putin is the real threat , and the us have said they 're out , i do n't see there is another choice . 
  trump has made it clear you ca n't rely on them . 
   almost nothing happened after this kind ** indecent ** when the wrong word is exactly the * right * word !, 
  i agree the optics can be portrayed negatively , the alternative would be to put another country in charge , denmark czechia finland or something . 
  not sure how that would play in germany . 
  there will be angst on this regardless , but i think it 's the right move given trump . 
  i doubt they expect to stand alone , i would assume it 's the desire to have control of their own troops so they ca n't be `` betrayed '' ( ie a strategic withdrawal as opposed to fight to the death over warsaw or something ) not polish , take with grain of salt , just putting myself in their shoes . 
  given their history i 'd be loathe to release control of a very effective military and hand it over to a country with less recent experience ( yes poland has had more battle experience in the last 25years than germany thanks to the yanks ), 
  the `` bmg '' as the pollster is the only reference , the `` data '' is incomplete and wrapped in emotive languages without providing information as to the question asked . 
  so , go on , if i 'm too dim to find the data and source , show me the data set , show me the splits between each question or at the least one actual question asked and the responses . 
  ie , this is providing the data ( link in the reuters article i provided above ) . 
  http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/britain-eu-scotland/010031ss43p/britain-eu-scotland.jpg it shows the question asked , the date , who did it , the sample size and what the result was . 
  that 's how you provide info about polls . 
  i 'm not `` blaming you '' , stop being so precious . 
  the express is an unreliable source as has been proved many times , and the `` data '' is not in the article , merely a bunch of assertions supposedly based on data to which there is no linkage . 
  edit and to cast further doubt on the article , an alternative publication draws the opposite conclusion from what seems to be the same poll http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-scotland-iduskbn15n061 conclusion : in the absence of the actual poll data treat anything from express with caution , the above does n't prove it wrong , but reuters has no overt political stance on brexit , whereas express does . 
  ergo balance of probability and past history suggests not to trust express ' version until verified with actual data, 
  according to an unreliable rag with undisguised political views . 
  i would n't take anything from express or sun as reliable . 
  yeah , i have a feeling we may have to soon at the going rate :-(, 
  he 's only been in 2 weeks , give him time, 
  voter repression and stand over tactics . 
  they 've been busily jailing all dissenting voices , they 'll make sure they do n't let their opponents vote . 
  poor dora . 
  did they forget to liberate andorra in ww2 or something ? 
  i 've googled and can not work out the reference . 
  take it out to 150 and they had a pretty good go with the american indians . 
  yeah but if the us declares war on australia and new zealand they 'll have to go help the us fight ... 
  it will get rather confusing . 
  i 'd rather a bottle of bordeaux :-), 
  i hear you . 
  i think a schism is already occurring , the pertinent questions are a ) is it repairable after 4 years , b ) if he gets 8 years will it be repairable then ? 
  i think your confidence that a democrat will get in in 4 years is misplaced , and the assumption that a democrat will be enough better than trump to heal the wounds quickly seems optimistic . 
  any democrat who can beat trump is going to have to be very like him . 
  i also sincerely doubt the americans on this thread who are very confident that he 'll be voted out next election . 
  the gop has a history of gerrymandering and vote suppression that will get a shot of steroids under trump ( we know how much he hates losing ) . 
  also some of the american population will be better off if he does some of the stimulus efforts he 's talking about . 
  if he 's as shithouse rat cunning as he seems to be , he 'll be making sure the benefits are landing heavily in swing states . 
  maybe i 'm just pessimistic, 
  that 's the same thing the americans were saying 2 months ago ;-( you 'll excuse me if i 'm nervous . 
  ** worst ** case ? 
  worst case is he gets re-elected in 4 years and pulls some sort of cunning stunt and makes himself dictator for life . 
  if we survive the next 4 years without a major war kicking off and trump gets voted out in the 2020 presidential election then i 'd call it a ** best ** case, 
  < shrug  fair enough , i wo n't argue that the us looks the same as rome , it does n't . 
  i 'm curious to hear how you are defining it though . 
  edit wikipedia does n't wholly agree with you https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empire  the term `` american empire '' refers to the united states ' cultural ideologies and foreign policy strategies . 
  the term is most commonly used to describe the u.s. 's status since the 20th century , but it can also be applied to the united states ' world standing before the rise of nationalism in the 20th century . 
  [ 31 ] the united states is not traditionally recognized as an empire , in part because the u.s. adopted a different political system from those that previous empires had used . 
  despite these systematic differences , the political objectives and strategies of the united states government have been quite similar to those of previous empires . 
  i do n't disagree , but then russia is bent on destroying eu because it feels threatened . 
  an alliance * might * subvert that . 
  was n't he an austrian ? 
  you assume the trump administration will end . 
  i * hope * it will but it 's by no means certain . 
  yes , you 'll undoubtably ( sp ? ),
