  say i 'm being overly paranoid , but he has been pulling all the highlights out of the hitler mussolini early years play book , i would n't lightly bet against a state of emergency and a delay on voting in 8 years . 
  a very good question , and i honestly think it would be the best solution in the short term ( a la ribbentrop pact ) , i do n't think the us would take very kindly to that option , but then they wo n't like a china pact either . 
  i guess russia just became an attractive bride for both eu and us :-), 
   more to do with trump 's apparent aim to break apart the eu . 
  which his candidate for the eu diplomat post has explicitly said he wants to see happen . 
  i actually think it 's more to do with his `` nato needs to be shut down '' than the wall or the break apart the eu btw . 
  if eu interests and us interests are diverging , and the one key reason that we tug forelock to america is about to be removed then willingness to bend over backwards is also removed . 
  i personally think its a good thing , eu should arm up and let trump pull his troops home . 
  lol . 
  seriously ? 
  the us has n't been exercising economic and cultural hegemony for the last several decades ? 
  they have n't been changing countries rulers at will , arm twisting countries to do things they would n't otherwise have done through economic or military tactics ? 
  it 's not all bad , to me the us have been at the benevolent end of the global dictator spectrum , but they are most certainly an empire with troops located in every part of the globe . 
  the ussr most certainly was an empire as well . 
  are russia now ? 
  to me yes , they have strong influence over a number of countries , but i could hear an argument against it . 
  similarly , are china ? 
  most definitely , take a wander around africa as well as asia , they are just not as loud ( or as strong yet ) as the americans . 
  i think your conclusion is probably correct but from a dubious start point . 
  ** if ** the eu can stay together ** and ** it lifts its military spending , its a big enough bloc to become a superpower . 
  that 's a lot of ifs . 
  the russians are threatened by the eu and so have been working to destroy its cohesion . 
  they also seem to have got the manchurian ( siberian ? ), 
  candidate into us presidential office . 
  it 's a long bow to conclude they will become allies though . 
  neutral relations / cessation of hostility with the us would be a massive improvement for them , but the only way the us could become an ally of russia would be a trump dictatorship ( not impossible , it 's early days ) . 
  again , a lot of ifs . 
  the us is definitely moving to hostility with china - it 's looking like trump wants a trade war - if he does that it will likely become a cold war . 
  the problem for the us is that much of the 1st world has excellent relationships with china and are n't terribly keen on cutting them . 
  i think we can safely say that the us will get a lot less support for hostility to china than they think . 
  trump ( and his voters ) do n't care , do n't think they need to , but there will be little support for sanctions and if he pushes it further i suspect the eu in particular would seriously consider pivoting to china rather than the us . 
  so , yes , an eu / china alliance very likely , but it 's more about trade and consequences of actions than `` it always happens this way '' do n't get me wrong there are scary amounts of historical resonance between now and several pre-major war periods in european history ( not just preww2 , but also resonance with preww1 and periods in each of the preceding 3 centuries ) . 
  i suspect you 'll find a similar drop in confidence in the us across all of europe and asia . 
   sweden is by far the most sceptical of russia of any country surveyed regardless of political views more skeptical than finland estonia , latvia or lithuania ? 
  edit sorry , missed that you provided a link . 
  ok well of those surveyed i 'm not surprised . 
  vat or equivalent sales tax for one, 
  fair point . 
  stop inserting logic into my feels dammit !, 
  :-) the equivalent of # 10 for a pint of beer was a bit of an eye opener . 
  i still liked norway though , just did n't drink for two weeks, 
  seems like it :-), 
  damn !, 
  are norwegian air still doing those cheap flights ? 
  tronder is trondheim area ? 
  it sounds to me like you 're trying to pick a fight with me about immigration . 
  i have no horse in this race , finland 's immigration is up to finland and the eu , i 'm not one nor very soon the other . 
  yeah she was danish he was swedish , pretty sure . 
  edit here you go http://mrrobot.wikia.com/wiki/tyrell_wellick, 
  sorry man , do n't understand what you 're saying there . 
  fig 4 if accurate definitely shows 2nd gen immigrants with a higher propensity to be employed than natives ( which is in line with the fact that life outcomes are correlated with the education of the parent , and most migrants into eu are skilled - the current wave of refugees is the exception ) . 
  fig 6 seems contradictory to what i understand to be the case in several countries hence needs to be investigated further before relying on it . 
  natives wanting to limit immigration being wrong or right is a values question which those graphs do n't address . 
  pretty much every study i 've ever seen shows that most 2nd gen migrants tend to be highly educated , high performing and highly motivated - usually because their parents left something shitty and drummed a work and study ethic into them . 
  belgium and france seem to be the exceptions to this rule on what i 've seen in previous studies . 
  lol . 
  ok , if you prefer a tenth of a percent . 
  happy ? 
  yes different parts of europe write it differently but seriously ? 
  sorry man , my finnish is non existent . 
  but , i think you 're right to question the 0.1 % - that whole graph just does n't add up - there 's something wrong there /, 
  no conflict . 
  one is the average of the full list , presumably weighted by population , the other is the individual splits per country edit actually you know what , i think the second one is the opposite way around to the way author has worded it . 
  intuitively there is no way the weighted average of hungary portugal luxembourg and bulgaria could outweigh the uk alone let alone uk and france . 
  i think the negative percentages in fig6 are actually the amount native born are less than 2nd gen. 
  simply because it is certainly a fact that hungary , poland and luxembourg have very small migrant intakes in total . 
  the maths simply does n't add up . 
  conversely , suggesting 2nd gen migrants in belgium are hugely more employed than natives also seems incredibly unlikely . 
  conclusion there is something very wrong with that graph ( as i think you were originally trying to work out ), 
  umm -0.1 % difference is tiny and almost certainly not statistically significant ( ie there is as much chance that the 2nd gen immigrants are outperforming the locals as there is a chance they are underperforming ) . 
  belgium and croatia have a problem . 
  portugal , hungary finland and poland do n't . 
  the 5 below them probably do n't either . 
  right . 
  you are reading it correctly . 
  was n't he swedish ? 
  yeah but the difference is post brexit they do n't have a choice about moving the stuff that requires passporting . 
  it 's not about tempting any more , now it 's a legal constraint , it 's the only reason switzerland does n't do it now . 
  so , you 're a bank , you 're being forced to either move a capability or give up the revenue and profit stream . 
  you do the maths and work out the optimisation point balancing costs and how much you move ( you can move all , nothing , just what is legally required or somehwere in between ) . 
  i do n't know what each bank will choose , but i know they will dispassionately choose what ever maximises their profit in the big picture , they are bankers after all . 
  do n't lose that big picture comment though , while these types of trades are not necessarily even a single digit percentage of the bank 's profits , they often correlate to access for other deals . 
  my guess is that this will significantly impact the total amount of dealing done through london , but eu is n't the whole world asia and the americas are large markets , we wo n't know until the crunch hits . 
  what i can say for sure , is that we will know before brexit actually occurs , because none of them will want to explain to their boards why they lost significant revenue streams , the projects will be done and dusted before the two years are up . 
  i 'll bet they 'll then move onto a 5 year cost rationalisation project to optimise to the total lowest cost between the eu and uk sites . 
  what the outcome of that is will depend on a bunch of things, 
  london became a primary banking centre because of 400 years of effort to become and remain one , the empire helped a lot in that . 
  leaving the eu is a disrupter but there is absolutely no reason those roles ca n't just as easily be done elsewhere in the eu and all the major banks are working on their plans for doing so . 
  yes there is capability and knowledge that would be impossible to immediately replicate , hence the major banks will triage who it is neccessary to throw money at to get to relocate , and who they 'll just replace locally . 
  it 's just another project for companies who do billions of pounds worth of projects on a regular basis, 
  yes , we 're heading for 1939 again but not the way you 're meaning . 
  this time it 's the anglophone countries with authoritarian populists at the helm , and germany & co as the liberal democracy bulwark of freedom . 
  oh the irony . 
  it 's not just that much of it is old , the key issues are coordination and supply lines . 
  the eu can field a reasonable amount of men and kit by each country , but the reality is that even with the nato structure the command chain is a nightmare and the supply chains could n't cope with anything more than a brief skirmish let alone a serious war . 
  if the yanks pull out or seriously disengage from nato our ability to defend a russian attack is seriously compromised . 
  we need to address this lack urgently . 
  understanding geo-politics and historical context is hardly paranoia . 
  it must be an interesting world you live in with your fingers in your ears saying lah lah lah, 
  * please * do n't confuse dollar value of spending with capability , that is only ever an approximation for the simple reason that its not apples with apples .
