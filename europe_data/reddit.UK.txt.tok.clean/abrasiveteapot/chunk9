  people do n't feel they have any say , they are ruled and not listened to . 
  and you do n't think this is as serious as a constitutional change ? 
  i mean this seriously , can you not see a difference between an overwhelming desire for change ( say 2/3rd or 3/4s of the vote ) and a bare pass ? 
  particularly when it was obtained on bald lies ? 
  yep , just did that for you , it offers me the options of english australian , english canadian english uk and english us . 
  do you have a point ? 
  the website is a website not a language , it will portray whatever characters the user in question uses out of the ascii set , i 'm guessing it will come as a surprise to you that there are reddit subs in languages other than english too, 
  snort . 
  not triggered at all by the spelling variances , am triggered by the op who decided to have a `` murica fuck yeah '' moment, 
  as per / u/dnomirraf link scotland , northern ireland and most of england pronounce it to rhyme with gone , yorkshire and some of the rest of the north go with the long o - tone pronounciation http://www.cam.ac.uk/sites/www.cam.ac.uk/files/scone_rhyme_with_gone.jpg ps , `` the uk '' = / = england only ... 
  gone is short o , `` gon '' tone is long o , tohhn, 
  in most countries a referendum of this consequence would have a higher threshold than a `` bare pass '' 52 % is hardly a resounding affirmation . 
  in australia and equivalent change would need a 2/3rds majority and a majority of the states . 
  given 2 of the 4 countries of the uk voted against it , and given it squeaked through by a bare 52/48 split , it 's hardly a basis for a massive change . 
  it is a basis for a solid investigation of what the people actually wanted and coming back to them with a solid proposal that would get more people on board . 
  i am very ambivalent about the eu , juncker in particular shows the worst of the eu project , but this is n't the way you change your country , this whole thing has been managed abysmally, 
  why not have a vote once we actually know what we 're voting for - some facts instead of airy fairy promises . 
  clear cut statement by the govt of what the new world will look like . 
  if you did n't think you 'd lose it i doubt you 'd be defending it so hard . 
  imnsho the majority of the leave vote was n't for leave , it was a general fuck you to the political establishment who have been fisting the majority of england since thatcher . 
  fair enough , but they did n't quite realise what the actual consequences were . 
  yes i know you 'll say `` i knew what it was for and what it meant '' and you probably did , but you 're a very small minority in my opinion . 
  that would fly if the leave vote had n't been won on outright lies . 
  many of the people who voted leave wo n't get what they thought they were voting for , so it seems reasonable to check back in when we know exactly what we will get . 
  350m for the nhs anyone ? 
  no way . 
  it 's a trained squirrel . 
  lol  this site is written in american english this site is written in more varieties of engrish ^ ( 1 ) than campbells have soups - your dialect is no more `` right '' than any other unless you can show me the reddit rule that requires postings to / r/europe to be spelt ^ ( 2 ) incorrectly ( 1 ) not a typo ( 2 ) correct usage in english ( as opposed to your sub dialect ), 
  as well as most of the uk , australians say scone rhyming with gone , but we also have a town ( in nsw ) called scone ( which is rhymed with tone ) , obviously must have been yorkshire men settled there, 
  still finland : sami speakers plus finnish plus swedish enclave in \u00c5land the swedish speakers are your belgian german speakers ; sami and finnish as main two languages ( does n't quite work as both sami and swedish are minority languages but near enough for government work ), 
  yep , \u00e5land thanks / r/polandball , i 'd never have known without you, 
  pfft there 's no such thing , where are you really from ? 
  yeah , but we all said the same about trump . 
  i agree the establishment * seems * to have a way to block lepen ... 
  1788 for australia , so squeaks into 18th c, 
  sure . 
  i get that , and i try to use your preferred terminology , but the majority of the uk populace would n't differentiate . 
  then again this is a country that lumps the ( several ? ), 
  billion people of the indian subcontinent in with the billion people of china , in with the billion of indochina/south east asia ( half the world 's population near enough ) under the banner `` asian '' . 
  many of them would throw a lot of the middle east in there too ... east europe vs west europe is amazing levels of subtlety given that schema ... 
  i 'm thinking you may have a point, 
   jews on the other hand , do not like mixted couple very much and any man marrying a jew woman has to convert . 
  utterly untrue , the exact opposite in fact . 
  jews make it very hard to convert . 
  other than making a straight rather than wiggly line from leicester to hull that looks about right !, 
  see it 's all about the cultural divide :-), 
  the border is fuzzy for the exact same reason we have had several threads discussing whether spain is south or west . 
  there is however a clear distinction between the former danelaw areas which retain a level of cultural connection to their former rulers , and the strongly norman south . 
  the greyness partly comes from the history of the celts/britons and the anglosaxon areas that were n't under danelaw, 
  yes , i 'd agree , central europe is a term i have never heard here from anyone who was n't polish , czech or romanian, 
  said every englishman ever, 
  yours is much nicer but the key should probably call out the overlap colours for clarity, 
  / u/speech500 's map linked above is overlapped as well hence spain is purple ( red + blue = west + south ) poland is dark green ( grey plus green = east + central ) etc, 
   there is also the idea that british people are `` anglo-saxon '' which is obviously a bit silly errm why is that silly ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-saxons `` the anglo-saxons were a people who inhabited great britain from the 5th century . '', 
  the romans pulled out , the angles , saxons and jutes moved in / invaded . 
  that 's where the word `` england '' is derived ( angle land ), 
   i think we should have supported isis against pkk or at least make some kind of a deal with them . 
  everything curently wrong with turkey in one sentence . 
  congratulations daesh supporter for confirming why `` not europe '' is the right nomenclature . 
  i was rebutting the assertion that the accusations of turkey funding isis were started by russia after their plane was shot down . 
  which was n't true . 
  not commenting on the veracity of the accusation ( which btw does actually have significant evidence ) reading comprehension disability must suck . 
  come on man , do i really have to put a / s on it ? 
  you normally have a sense of humour, 
  steady on old chap . 
  there 's no need for insults . 
  errm how do you cook if you 're not allowed to own a knife longer than 8.5 cm ? 
  chopping vege must take hours . 
  did you perhaps mean `` not allowed to carry in public '' ? 
   turkey has supported isis , purchased oil from them  this piece appeared sometime in 2015 when we downed the russian jet . 
  russia went on a pretty scathing pr war against turkey at this time . 
  this is lying by omission . 
  bollocks . 
  reports of erdogan 's son buying oil off isis and selling them arms was all over twitter years before the russian plane was shot . 
  errm refusing to accept chlorinated chicken means we 're prejudiced ? 
  nice , but why is france white ? 
  yeah , agreed, 
  i had always thought portugal was a lot more culturally similar to italy and spain than ireland or uk . 
  is that untrue/unfair ? 
  hence why even though you 're geographically west i see you as mediterranean or `` southern '' . 
  same as uk may be geographically north but it 's culturally closer to france and benelux , hence western . 
  this is how i see it , except i 'd put uk and roi in western rather than northern , and i 'd say mediterranean rather than southern . 
   benefits are not really a good example since those are regulated very strictly for obvious reasons . 
  they are however an outlier in that it is still not allowed to discriminate based on nationality . 
  this principle of non-discrimination is unrelated to freedom of movement . 
  ofcourse you can set certain criteria such as a residence permit or whatever , as long as that applies to everyone equally good lord . 
  and you think guns are n't `` regulated very strictly for obvious reason '' ? 
  of course they are . 
  they ** are n't ** `` discriminating based on nationality '' they are discriminating based on residency ** exactly ** the same as most countries ** legally ** and ** already ** do for welfare , and of course it applies to everyone who is a resident in czechia ( and the same rules are applied in every other eu country ) that was already stated further up the thread . 
  while i 'm with you that the eu directive is bollocks and should be fought , that is not an accurate characterisation of the situation in the uk , yes it is overtly controlled ( and a bit excessively in my opinion ) but hunting and target rifles and shotguns are n't that hard to get approval to own . 
  no , that 's not correct . 
  freedom of movement does n't mean you 're exempt from local laws . 
  if czech law requires czech residency to buy a gun , you ca n't say `` does n't apply to me , i 'm dutch '' . 
  the same way you usually need to have residency and worked in a country before you can claim welfare . 
  you ca n't just move from athens to amsterdam and claim unemplyment benefit because you were registered in greece can you ? 
  how on earth does that prove your point ? 
  it proves the exact opposite , they got less than a fifth of what russia got !, 
  great movie , i always thought it was russian , oops . 
   i did n't say a single inaccurate thing nor pass a judgement .
