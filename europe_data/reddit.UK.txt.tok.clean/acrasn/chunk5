  these guys are doing the same job german and british truckers do without the benefits for half the pay . 
  it 's sad to see . 
  the cheek for the company to say that ` they can just go home whenever ', 
  exactly , props to her for keeping it secret . 
  one things for sure though , she is an arsenal fan . 
  the queens keeping it classy . 
  ca n't imagine her to ever support chelsea/west ham/spurs . 
  i sometimes really wonder about what the defender of the faith , protector of the realm thinks about political issues, 
  can someone give me a background here ? 
  why are people sending explosive letters to finance related persons ? 
  it 's just wishful thinking from him . 
  it 's like telling your mates how you 'd set the team up if you were a football manager ` yeah lad id go 4 4 2 fellayneh and eebra uptop ' not gon na happen, 
  once in a scottish generation is about 5 years, 
  the usa 's military might will always amaze me no matter how many times i see it, 
  i wholeheartedly agree not to judge a man on appearance but his policies and ambitions . 
  i am contradicting myself here i admit . 
  the british media was on a witch hunt for ed 's appearances , no one makes fun of davis for looking like an evil villain, 
  if mifid 2 is changed just to single out the uk ( but keep the us and singapore ) then you can expect hostile relations & negotiations, 
  nope , i actually voted for miliband . 
  just something about david davis that makes him look like a villain . 
  as long as he gets the job done . 
  which will result in collateral damage , us , uk & singapore, 
  i find this bit very interesting `` uk based financial services firms have passporting rights as members of the eu . 
  -- but so too under the mifid2 directive will financial services companies from countries like the us , hong kong and singapore whose financial regulatory systems are deemed to have ` regulatory equivalence ' as would the uk 's ; -- most british ucits funds choose to operate via companies set up in luxembourg and dublin rather than using their passport from london . 
  ( this has not caused an exodus of jobs from london . ), 
  moreover , they clearly find the value of low tax in these countries more than offsets the extra cost of setting up companies . 
  this puts fairly modest value on passporting ; -- the growth in uk financial services exports to the eu does not show any marked change since passports were introduced ; -- british financial companies seem to export very successfully without passports to countries like the usa and switzerland -- our two largest markets ; -- most british financial services business is wholesale whereas passports are largely designed to facilitate retail business . '', 
  it would be stupid to say the uk is ready for no deal then say we have made no assessment of what no deal means . 
  they clearly have . 
  ( or so i hope ! ), 
  i mean , look at david davis ' face , this man is a snide , untrustworthy , cunning , smug little cunt https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/david_davis_2016.jpg/1200px-david_davis_2016.jpg, 
  i like to think that for any currency that experiences fluctuation or troubles you would try to bring out information in order to protect it against a massive drop . 
  nothing that 's special only to the gbp, 
  i often read the personal finance subreddit and you get usa graduates starting their first job at like $ 70k . 
  sure there are other factors to take into account that make that pay relative and all their student debt etc but we need to see an increase in wages in the uk/eu, 
  my money is on that this ` spat ' will go back and forth . 
  all sorts of things politicians will say to the media so that they look good to their electorate only for this fiasco to conclude in two odd years with both sides reaching a sensible deal in order to limit damage to both parties . 
  when that terrible coup happened , erdogan said it was ' a gift from god ' the whole diplomatic spat between nl and turkey has been a gift from erdogan to rutte ruttes great handling of the situation definitely has won him some votes, 
  i would give my left testicle to have scenic views like the norweigans, 
  good move for both sides ` the exact sum of the divorce settlement would be agreed later in the negotiations . 
  amid reports that the uk could face a bill of between $ 34bn ( # 30bn ) to $ 60bn ( # 52bn ) , mr barnier is saying the exact sum will be determined on the eu side by the eu 's court of auditors towards the end of the two year negotiations . 
  the ballpark in brussels is that the eu has liabilities of around $ 600bn ( # 520bn ) . 
  the uk would be responsible for around 12 % of that , producing a rough figure of $ 60bn ( # 52bn ) . ', 
  interesting daily mail headline soon : victory for britain , brussels backs down due to british power, 
  i rented a villa in the south over christmas . 
  plesantly it was sunshine during the day very often , averaging 18-20c . 
  at night however man was it freezing !, 
  luckily the landlord had installed ac 's which could blast out hot air . 
  love your country , will be visiting again end of this month !, 
  i like that quote, 
  come on pirates , you should know stealing a greek tanker means no payday infact expect to make a loss feeding the cabin crew, 
  i visit the algarve quite often . 
  near faro/portimao/lagoa , everyone makws everything from cork and your houses in the south get very cold during winter, 
  haha i thought you did !, 
  one who blindly defends their country is a fool . 
  thanks for your contribution . 
  i 'm not diverting anything , britain is also guilty of such crimes . 
  there goes your argument !, 
  getting the said governments to admit waterboarding wo n't be possible either . 
  sure its alleged but if x amount of people say it im sure there 'll be some substance to it, 
  the above article says so , that is the source, 
  scotlands deficit is 10 % . 
  that means they cannkt adopt the euro just yet , i should of been more clearer . 
  if scotland does join the eu , a favourable deal between eu and uk will be needed for scotlands trade is heavily reliant on the uk . 
  not a thing to be proud of as a british citizen however i think the eu needs to conduct an inquest into hungary/romania/bulgaria for the torture methods such as waterboarding that is being done on these refugees . 
  sure , the 1st country you arrive in is the one you should reside in as its safe , but if i were a refugee i would not look to settle in bulgaria/romania/hungary because integration would be more difficult and welfare/prospects of a better life are dimmer than residing in western/northern eu nations . 
  however , amongst this refugee crisis is also a large amount of economic migrants trying to fit in . 
  i am more for creating safe havens in said countries personally . 
  there is no such thing as a queue in terms of one country must join before the next one etc but what do people mean by ` quicker ? ', 
  surely they have to go through the accession talks like any other country , do they mean to skip a few chapters or something ? 
  scotland being in the uk already abides by a lot of eu regulation but i think economy will be a big factor , otherwise the eu ends up with another greece, 
  go ahead boys , butcher it apart . 
  feast !, 
  agreed . 
  have you even left the uk ? 
  go on , leave this ` shithole ' and lets see how you fair, 
  we generally have the option to learn french , german and spanish during secondary school but it 's generally the piss about class that no one focuses in, 
  no , of course those people did not deserve to die . 
  op just seems on a propaganda mission . 
  i am just giving the other side . 
  we are on / europe not / jokes, 
  i 'm not delusional , i accept that the uk has comitted many atrocities in the past . 
  the difference is , you can not accept the crimes of your state,

  it 's always funny when you hand it to someone and they know its legal tender but they really do n't want to accept it but have no choice,

  hahaha you cant even beat them for 40 years and you are getting your arse handed to you in syria . 
  if european turks love turkey and erdogan so much why dont they fuck off back to turkey ? 
  selective picking . 
  i can not be bothered to link you as you will dismiss . 
  the difference between us is i dont follow blindly and can accept crimes from both sides , just like the way the uk handled ireland . 
  you are delusional if you think your problems can be solved by military only !, 
  peaceful solution needed, 
  would you like me to link you to turkish state crimes ? 
  or will you dismiss the dead civilians as terrorists just because they 're kurdish ? 
  you are an akp puppet , delusional like half your country . 
  say bye bye to your neo-ottoman intentions, 
  and also to take away attention from syria , the battle that erdogan is currently losing . 
  russia and the us have both decided to block erdogans ambitions of moving into manbij which is currently in the hands of the sdf ( kurdish led multi ethnic group ), 
  if scotland does leave and manage to use the euro , it will save me the embarrassment of handing over someone a scottish # 5 or # 10 note , god its like hot potato .
