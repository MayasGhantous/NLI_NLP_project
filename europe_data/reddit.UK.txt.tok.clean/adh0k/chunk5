  loosing 10 % is a lot . 
  i dont know how many greek youth has emigrated and would love to see figures i have found some data : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/19/young-talented-greek-generation-g-worlds-biggest-brain-drain, 
  lol - of course france would say that . 
  they did the `` homework . '', 
  good on france for taking the initiative and being constructive . 
  i dont know . 
  you need to look at more scientific data to get an answer . 
  if you have over 55 % of young people unemployed , and when you have a country experiencing a depression of a similar nature to what the usa experienced in 1929 then i dont think that greece is living the good life and that they may be doing worse . 
  if the ecb went against its mandate / rules then it should be taken to court . 
  surely you dont want the ecb to make up its policies as it goes along - or do you ? 
  a higher pension does not mean a higher standard of living . 
  i dont know what your standard of living is compared to other eu countries but you need to look at that rather than an absolute amount . 
  they should not have been made to pay for greeces debts - and their anger should be directed at the people who put forward this plan - of bailing out the banks and passing the debts to the eu taxpayers . 
  also i hate the attitude - `` well i was raped so why should they also not get raped . '', 
  may they continue to experience being raped until they learn to fight against it - for themselves and others . 
  then so are most economists when discussing austerity and depression . 
  they do not recommend austerity during a depression . 
  there are always exceptions and anomalies . 
  it does not mean he is wrong in regards to his theories . 
  he may be wrong in regards to his analysis of these baltic countries . 
  the article could be subject to criticism as well and does not prove anything . 
  edited-the original, 
  and who is foreighpolicy.com ? 
  does a single article that is rather biased discredit krugman , financial times , stiglitz ( another nobel economist ) , friedman , the imf research departemnt , the us governments view and most economists . 
  biglebowskibot  you 're not wrong , walter , you 're just an asshole . 
  thank you for your response . 
  i will be polite and just let your response define you . 
  there is no doubt what you are . 
  it seems you want to associate with the good things - like the roman times but not the things you disapprove of . 
  am i wrong ? 
  either you are share the roman culture and ethnicity or not . 
  if you did then they are your people . 
  like them or not . 
  are you saying you are not italian or roman ? 
  are people in northen italy of different ethnicity ? 
  what is your history then . 
  do northen italians generally feel this way ? 
  from a curious brit, 
  why do you need to distinguish your flair to state that you are `` northen italy '' ? 
  do you feel that you are superior to `` southern italy '' are you ashamed of being italian ? 
  or is northen italy a separate place . 
  thank you - i accept that you concede . 
  and that you cant give me any facts to back your repetitions . 
  there is no point when you do not have facts and you hide behind repeating the same lines . 
  you are a parrot who only repeates the same lines without the understanding . 
  i thought a car analogy ( you are not bright enough to grasp the concept of an analogy ) may explain it but obviously i needed crayons to draw the concepts . 
  if you want a discussion - facts backed by economists or gtfo . 
  your repartitions are impotent . 
  show me the articles from your economists and explain the problem with their assumptions . 
  you have not done that yet . 
  i am doubting your ability to do that . 
  i agree what is scary is that a lot of people believe they know . 
  i have done 3 years of economics at university and all i know how little i know . 
  i am blaming greece for this mess , and the way it was governed . 
  but we should also blame the bankers who have gave the credit - who made irresponsible decisions ** knowing ** the situation . 
  you have not read or understood the imf report that was released last week . 
  they may have had a point - but they did not do their job in greece and they have lost credibility . 
  they scared instead of educate . 
  you are stating facts . 
  but so what ? 
  do you understand the concept of what it means to run a surplus when the economy is contracting and when its in depression . 
  a car has 4 tyres . 
  that is a fact that you have stated . 
  if you take off the 4th wheel then it can not operate as a car . 
  that is fact . 
  by the way the surplus is before the interest and debt payments . 
  you dont understand the economic concepts . 
  find me a source that shows that the current deal has any economic merit instead of describing things . 
  yes - and they were in favour of the yes vote . 
  this was the media that did not inform the public about the situation in greece pre debt crises . 
  this is a media that has not dont its job . 
  i am torn . 
  i dont think most people understand economics - dare i say even the redditors here . 
  but i do think that in matters that affect their , future people should have the right to decide as long as they understand the consequences and implications of their vote . 
  if you have educated informed citizens then yes . 
  but i dont think this was the case in greece . 
  the retirement age is now 67 . 
  however the fact that some people could retire at 50 is embarrassing and ridiculous and shows how fucked up the system in greece was and is . 
  every one has an economic opinion - but the experts argue differently to your `` opinion '' . 
  i believe the arguments put forward by the imf , heavy weight economists such as krugman , shiller , and many others . 
  they have all stated that the debt is not sustainable and the country is bust . 
  if greece accepts the terms , it will have to keep borrowing and increasing its debt , to pay its debt i think your opinion is based on your subjective view and lack of understanding of economic concepts and facts . 
  do you understand the concept of shrinking gdp and the concept of debt to gdp ? 
  i know the comment is not popular and i will be voted down but the fact is greece can not pay this debt even if they wanted to . 
  armchair economists will vote me down , but not present me with economic arguments - or economists who can confirm the opinions that you put forward . 
  you still have not provided a source . 
  do you have a source ? 
  also a lot of people have been forced to take early retirement because of the staff cuts required by the troika . 
  a person in greece who loses their job at 60 will never be able to find another job . 
  this pension is used to support the family unit as most other people in the family are also not working . 
  i agree . 
  they have to make a lot of changes and take responsibility . 
  and not abuse the system . 
  that is why greeks want the eu/euro - they trust it a lot more than they trust their political system . 
  they have mismanaged their country . 
  i dont think any greek will disagree . 
   no , the retirement age will be 67 in 2022 . 
  the newest bailout condition asked to speed up the process , and was rejected . 
  ** it is 67 ** .
