from seeing videos of this kind of thing in glasgow i think the police only turn up to this kind of thing ( unless it 's actual well defined hate speech ) if someone has made a complaint to them . 
  at this point they tell the person to stop and if they refuse they get arrested . 
  it 's called scotland the brave in case you want to know the name . 
  alongside flower of scotland and scots wha hae , it 's one of a few unofficial scottish national anthems . 
  do n't think there 's much opportunity for that in fife , sorry pal . 
  over the course of a month or so it 's gone to complete trash . 
  it felt more like a community , and discussion was a lot more ... moderate to say the least . 
  now it 's just a huge anti-immigration circlejerk , and i doubt that 'll end when the crisis finishes . 
  there should be diversity of opinion but when anyone who sticks their head above the parapet and posts something leftist or pro-immigrant gets immediately shouted down then you know that there is a serious problem . 
  the same happened during the greek crisis . 
  i do n't really know what the solution is . 
  yours, 
  hopefully it 's easier for us as we have widespread internet access now to help campaign , which sadly was n't really available to quebec in between its referendums . 
  i 'd imagine it 'll be 2021/2022 before we hold a second , although we could get one earlier depending on what happens in westminster . 
  there 'll be a second referendum at some point i 'd bet . 
  i ca n't say i 've met anyone that 's changed their mind but the polls suggest that it 's happened . 
  i 'd imagine its a mixture of tory government , devo-max going undelivered even though we voted for it in may and a sense of inevitability to the whole thing ; people wanting to be on ( what they feel is ) the winning side of history . 
  the largest ever poll result in favour of independence , and the first to show a pro-indy majority even with undecideds included . 
  edinburgh has a reputation within scotland as being unfriendly and sort of aloof , especially compared with glasgow . 
  so this comes as a wee bit surprising . 
  we do n't talk about that, 
  any time we ventured outside of scotland always ended in disaster . 
  case in point : the battle of flodden . 
  during the italian wars of the 1500s , we were persuaded to invade england by france . 
  we took the biggest army ever to go south , with a massive artillery train and the latest arms from the continent , and positioned it on a hill in northumbria . 
  we should have won against the smaller army , but for some reason we came down the hill and were annihilated , losing most of the top nobles of the time aswell as our king . 
  france and england then spent the rest of the century manipulating us to use against each other . 
  also from that time , we built the biggest ship in europe , the great michael , and put the biggest gun in europe , mons meg , on top of it . 
  still holds the record for biggest calibre gun on a ship . 
  it was built with all seriousness so that we could take constantinople from the ottomans , which is the embarrassing part . 
  you have to admire the confidence . 
  eorpa is a pretty good current affairs programme in gaelic that covers social issues all over europe , so i think that 'd be scotland 's best contribution . 
  other than that i 'd say all the best scottish productions are comedies that would n't translate very well to the outside world sadly . 
  i remember well the time alistair darling stood up in front of tv cameras and clearly warned that saudi arabia would increase oil production in order to destabilise iran and russia and make the us fracking industry unprofitable , meaning that the oil price would decline far below what anyone else had predicted / s. 
  you still would n't be misleading anyone . 
  if the scenario was truly analogous , the drop in shares would be caused by something so complex and unpredictable that you would technically be right to say `` my shares should give us # 8000 '' . 
  but anyway , the idea that the snp should take any blame for the oil price slump is the same kind of intellectual dishonesty that the tories use in claiming that labour alone caused the 2008 crisis . 
  that really is misleading people . 
  can you claim that the obr 's figures were n't propaganda also ? 
  http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/domestic_politics/obr+independence+undermined+by+bias+claims/3705182.html alistair darling did n't agree . 
  how were they misleading anyone exactly ? 
  if i tell someone that i 'll go on a date with them later but get hit by a bus on my way , have i lied to them about going on the date ? 
  have i misled them ? 
  no , because something happened completely out-with my control . 
  i 'm guessing every economist and government worldwide also misled the people in failing to predict the oil price collapse . 
  you ca n't ` mislead ' people about something which you have no idea is going to happen . 
  i was referring to what was said in the last sentence of the post i replied to . 
  i 'm not sure if a society which forces people to work against their will can be called a society that functions . 
  while thats true for the uk party , in scotland ukip is at the time being really a one man job . 
  david coburn self identifies as a right wing libertarian , so i 've put that as it is hard to understand the policy of ukip in scotland . 
  i 'll change it to populist . 
  just noticed i 've made the same mistake with the greens too , forgot to mention maggie chapman . 
  i think eurosceptic does n't necessarily mean that you want to leave the eu , just that you 're sceptical of the organisation . 
  syriza and podemos are sometimes described as eurosceptic for example . 
  i see . 
  i 've edited the original post anyway , i apologise if i 've mentioned sheridan too much in the context of the party . 
  woops - was being made out on the internet like the ssp had fully signed up to the idea . 
  does that mean that the ssp will stand in 2016 under the banner of the left project ? 
  or will they just be standing as the ssp ? 
  some highlights include : [ this rant about the snp 's ` plans ' to fill the highlands with ` pashtun warriors ' ] ( http://youtu.be/o2evxwea7s4 ) , [ his mating call at the beginning of this interview ] ( http://youtu.be/i_htcio6ddc ) , [ his ban from wikipedia for editing the ukip article 65 times ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/29/ukip-mep-david-coburn-banned-wikipedia-indefinitely ) , [ this mad pre-referendum tweet about alex salmond ] ( https://twitter.com/davidcoburnukip/status/508334766308216832 ) , [ the time he joked to the press about a member of the scottish government being an islamic terrorist ] ( http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/its-bollocks-says-ukips-david-5337050 ) , [ these pictures ] ( http://www.sunnation.co.uk/here-are-some-pictures-of-ukip-mep-david-coburn-stroking-some-hairy-cows/ ) and his parties [ manifesto launch in scotland ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/05/05/ukip-scotland-manifesto-launch_n_7213838.html ) . 
  that makes more sense yeah . 
  they would n't have considered the 1707 union under threat when they named it i guess . 
  ** snp ( scottish national party ) ** the snp is currently the governing party in holyrood ( the scottish devolved parliament ) , and are led by nicola sturgeon , who is the first minister of scotland . 
  they 've been in power since 2007 and in 2011 were re-elected with a majority ( which is n't easy in the mixed member proportional system we have in scotland ) . 
  they also have 56 out of 59 scottish members of the uk parliament , and are polling at 60 % for the next election . 
  their ideology is basically that scotland should secede from the united kingdom and become an independent state within the eu . 
  they are pro immigration , have an almost keynesian economic policy and are against the uk possessing nuclear weapons . 
  they are left of the centre in uk politics at least , but are often criticised from the left because they still define themselves as pro business , and do n't have a track record for raising taxes or calling for higher welfare despite their leftist rhetoric . 
  their huge popularity stems from them being seen as competent in government , a number of popular policies they 've enacted ( no tuition fees , free prescriptions ) and a general feeling that they stand up and care about scotland the most , seeing as they are the only large party based within the country . 
  their critics accuse them of being incompetent in health and education , authoritarianism and having unruly supporters ( which is over-exaggerated in the largely unsupportive media ) . 
  ** scottish labour ** scottish labour is the scottish division of the uk labour party . 
  they are a traditional social democratic party , and are currently leaderless after losing all but one of their seats in the uk general election to the snp . 
  until recently labour was the largest party in scotland , but its voter base has largely left it for the snp and smaller parties . 
  its main seat of power is now in local councils and it is currently polling around the 20 % mark . 
  at the present moment , it is hard to tell what labours policies are ( due to leadership elections in scotland and across the uk ) but at the last election their policies were generally left of centre but involved continued austerity and the retention of nuclear weapons . 
  they are in favour of some higher taxes on the wealthy and wish for scotland to remain within the uk . 
  their support has fallen rapidly due to a feeling that they attack the snp too regularly , that they have drifted right and are ` red tories ' , and that the scottish labour party is a b team under direct control from london . 
  ** scottish conservative and unionist party ** the conservatives or tories are a pro business , centre right party that are in power across the uk . 
  they believe in lower taxes and welfare , greater personal responsibility , low immigration and that private is generally better than public . 
  they are led by ruth davidson . 
  as their full name suggests , they support the union between scotland and england passionately . 
  it is a core part of their ideology that the two countries remain united , yet they support the right of scotland to secede if it votes to . 
  in the mid 20th century , this party was the largest in scotland mainly due to its association with protestantism at that time . 
  there is no sectarian aspect to the party today however . 
  since then , the party has declined , mostly due to the rapid de-industrialisation that took place under margaret thatcher , among other policies , making them hated in much of urban scotland . 
  their support is generally confined to rural areas unaffected by this period , with a stronghold being the south of scotland.they are polling in the mid teens at present , and may increase their seats marginally in the next election . 
  ** scottish liberal democrats ** the lib dems are a centrist party that are socially liberal . 
  they believe in greater localism , and while they are opposed to scottish independence they support a form of federalism between the nations of the uk . 
  historically the party drew its supports from the highlands of scotland , however today their base of power has been shattered by their 2010 decision to go into coalition with the conservatives in westminster . 
  they are currently polling under 10 % percent , and are forecast to lose seats at the next election . 
  they are led by willie rennie ** scottish green party ** the green party are the smallest party in holyrood , and the farthest to the left . 
  their policies are based on environmentalism and socialism . 
  they are led by two co-convenors : patrick harvie and maggie chapman ( though harvie is given more publicity and is more well known in general ) and they are currently polling at around 10 % on the list vote meaning they are in line to increase their number of seats . 
  the greens support scottish independence and are the party on friendliest terms with the snp , despite the greens taking a much more leftwing stance on many issues . 
  ** ukip ** ukip support british withdrawal from the european union . 
  they are led by david coburn mep , their sole elected representative in scotland . 
  they are a right wing ~ ~ libertarian ~ ~ populist party that is anti immigration and tends to appeal to loyalism within scotland . 
  they advocate reduction of the powers and budget of holyrood so are polling low and probably wo n't take a seat next year . 
  ~ ~ scottish left project ~ ~ ** scottish socialist party ** the most leftwing of all mainstream parties , the socialists have two co-spokespeople : colin fox and sandra webster . 
  early last decade , the party got into the scottish parliament and was emerging as a viable leftist opposition .
