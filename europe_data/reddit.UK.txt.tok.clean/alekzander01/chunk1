i use it already . 
  level 7 french !, 
  ca n't wait to speak english in germany and have nationalists get angry at me , only for me to show them my german passport i do n't even speak german . 
  my mum never taught me !, 
  trying to learn though, 
  my family used to live in holland park ( near the greek consulate ) . 
  we left when i was a wee baby though the park is great , i love the old house with its semi ruins , and the japanese garden too . 
  i preferred it over hyde park when i visited london, 
  the white house is pretty tiny when you see it in person, 
  you failed in 1453 :( jk , turkey is cool . 
  erdogan is a bit suspicious though, 
  there is hope then , guess my norman surname wo n't be alone now i just got ta actually learn french and swiss german, 
  but will i ever be swiss ? 
  and how does one go about earning swiss wages ? 
  brazil here you people know nothing of shit roads, 
  oh my god we have better roads in brazil !, 
  oh right my knowledge of the english civil war is shite . 
  not mentioned often . 
  i was educated in a british-brazilian school and i learned it there , but my british friends seem to forget it and i remind them about it most of the time when you say revolution you usually think `` france kills king '' . 
  not `` anglos get mad at catholics and invite the dutch for tea and ruling '', 
  hehe , `` woo i will now call him `` king woo the iii '', 
  independent ? 
  normandy was a french vassal that was given to rollo . 
  they spoke french , fought on horse ( a frankish thing ) and had french names ( william , sainte claire , robert , stephen , etc ), 
  i still find the thought that england had a revolution be weird, 
  yeah . 
  despite being a scandinavian he spoke norman french , fought on horse , and considered himself a frank/french, 
  british troops from spain . 
  not canadian , at all, 
  thank god , finally a map not made by dailmaily with the `` muhammad ! '', 
  fear mongering, 
  norway declares sovereignty over the orkneys, 
  paradox games ( ck2 , eu4 , and vic 2 being the big 3 ) are a lot more complex . 
  which is why they 're so much harder to learn , but once you do they are awesome for strategy . 
  i never like civ for historical stuf like this victoria 2 and eu4 however ! ... 
  non-eu here ( well , eu citizen , but living in brazil ! ), 
  why is ~ ~ independent ~ ~ telegraph so bad ? 
  estonia has invaded rightful ivan clay !, 
  quick !, 
  elizabeth declares claim to french throne * aux armes citoyens !, 
  bloody norman aristocrats . 
  guerra da cis platina never forget `` uruguay ist brazilian ! '', 
  ah yes , \u00e7a va and salut ... `` salut '' `` salut '' '' \u00c7a va ? '', 
  '' \u00c7a va '' `` salut `` salut '' damn frenchies and their short conversations, 
  where did you learn the other languages ? 
  especially portuguese !, 
  look at you , fancy swiss . 
  speaking 4 languages and shit . 
  shit , am from a norman family and i do n't know . 
  fook you french !, 
  come on now , let 's not bring back cromwell . 
  that ' b be enough to restart northern irish independence, 
  `` these bastards do n't even realize i 'll still be the queen of scotland '', 
  no royal baby ? 
  rome = rome athens = athens * i am genius * / jk edit : was not making fun of you btw . 
  the jews needed it due to the desert being bad for the peepee , since you only wash it every decade . 
  it looks like a secret message !, 
  hear hear , the great beloved nordics have spoken !, 
  now scatter stormfront , raus raus !, 
  the jews and muslims were getting along okay in medieval jerusalem . 
  hell , before the radicals came about they even allowed christians to safely pilgrim there, 
  seems 50/50 for me . 
  monday it 's a liberal orgy , on tuesday it 's a nuremburg rally, 
  we all can do it !, 
  join in everyone !, 
  just like the christian reformations in 1400-1600 's funnily enough , islam is in the 1400 's of their calendar i think ( islam having started in the 600 's and all ) . 
  culture always evolves with or without migration . 
  look at scandinavia , 1000 years ago they were pagan vikings , and then in the 1600 's they were christians who looked nothing like the vikings except for having blonde hair . 
  same for greece ; look at greece in 100 bc and greece in 1000 ad . 
  the byzantines and classic greeks are very different but they were n't subject to mass migration like the west was, 
  you did n't rape 'em , you stayed in germany , we 're the anglo-saxons here mate, 
  for real . 
  people act as if god put each nationality on earth and they all stay put since creation . 
  the english themselves are descendants of a bunch of german migrants . 
  half of western europe is probably descendant of a germanic-bastard or a roman bastard child , add in the asiatic huns and magyars , plus the turks and moors . 
  europe is a massive melting pot , as is every continent because people are always moving and always banging, 
  source is 1 picture with barely any background or context . 
  yeah right , seems reliable . 
  tries to measure gdp all the way back to bc times too ... 
  what 's worse , farage was right or / pol / being right ? 
  oh god i ca n't believe this could ever happen, 
  dubai is a pretty horrible place , they have slaves ffs, 
  i heard brevik * shouted * the high king apart !, 
  go back to your own country you damn * kittens !, 
  divide and conquer . 
  the elves can easily beat a divided empire, 
  maybe york and dublin, 
  eh , they 've had wars over less, 
  yes , the french should 've just bent over and invited the nazis to fuck them in their asses while deporting all the `` undesirables '' to death camps . 
  yes the taliban fight against occupiers too , difference is that the american occupiers ** do n't ** send anyone to gas chambers or work them to death as slaves because they believe they 're racially superior , unlike the nazis which did . 
  french broke the rules , so what ? 
  germans were doing the exact same ( no actually , they were doing a million times * worse * ) in the east . 
  you know , sending in killing squads to kill slavs , rounding up jews , raping sex slaves in their brothels , leveling their cities , and successfully managing to anger people who initially greeted them as liberators . 
  are the polish resistance `` terrorists '' too ? 
  yes it ca n't be denied . 
  but it also ca n't be denied they were brave for resisting against * literal nazis who send people to death camps * and who invaded their country . 
  french generally do n't deny women right to go to school along with other things like the taliban do . 
   french terrorists wot in case you forgot , germany * invaded * france after they started the war by invading poland . 
  the french were literally living under ** actual nazis ** . 
  the game makes you realize how disconnected the leaders are from what they 're doing,
