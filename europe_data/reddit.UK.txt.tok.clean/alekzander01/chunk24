  oh and the indian army was a volunteer based one . 
   you seem to miss the point those were not allies those were vassals if we are honest . 
  vassals shipped in from all over the world to die for the british . 
  no , no they were n't . 
  they were n't vassals since 1931 , that 's some years before ww2 began . 
  comparing canada , nz to india is idiotic , and even in india the army was made up of volunteers . 
   why were canadian soldiers and new zealand soldiers in europe ? 
  because they declared war on germany ? 
  canada already controlled their own foreign policy by then . 
   well , that 's what they tell you in school it 's more about german priorities than capabilities . 
  no , german capabilities for an amphibious invasion were in fact severely lacking ( ayy lets cross the channel on a river barge , that 's gon na end well ) , and they simply failed to defeat the royal navy and air force . 
  post-war war games also ended with german defeat in an attempted landing . 
  hey , stanley kubrick made a ww1 movie following french soldiers , so there 's something i guess ? 
   americans ... 
  dice is a swedish company . 
  but yeah , american pandering because they 're the biggest audience . 
  thanks, 
   claiming to be historically accurate ( ? 
  ) , they had black german soldiers fighting in europe . 
  it would be okay if it was a map set in africa given that there were black soldiers fighting for germany there , but europe ?!, 
  oh , and there was only 1 white guy in the british army classes . 
  iirc the character skins are 1 african , 1 indian , 1 was supposed to be an aborigine i guess ? 
  ( link : http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2016/26/1467101884-1467101310563.jpg ) i 'm all for representing indian , african , etc. 
  soldiers in the british army , the british-indian army was the largest volunteer only fighting force in history after all . 
  but it 's a bit ridiculous to show more of them fighting in france than white europeans ( who were the overwhelming majority of soldiers fighting in europe ) . 
  mate , * you * were the one parroting `` aktschually it was an invasion '' as if there was any difference between iraq war and invasion of iraq . 
  also  lead to the birth of modern terrorism . 
  terrorism began long before 2003 you know ? 
  both sides during the cold war used it extensively , it 's not exactly new . 
  yeah no shit , but it was one of the biggest supporters of toppling gadaffi , you 're the one trying to pin all of the blame on the us . 
  marshall plan ring any bells ? 
  texas too . 
   uk ahead of usa , china , russia i mean , that 's pretty nice but ... how ? 
  oh boy , link to that dunkirk post plz ? 
   falklands are it wo n't work if you use the ~ ~ british ~ ~ correct name . 
  i was hoping for more salty americans given that they 're the ones who pumped europe with cash and are the ones who actually opposed russia . 
  albeit russia does have the potential to be a super power , and they still are a major one . 
  do n't forget the grand tetons huehuehue, 
  that 's just the rustic decoration . 
  the rats are actually dressed up and trained hamsters , perfectly safe to touch !, 
  we upped our tourism game with brexit already , devaluing the pound !, 
   they were us allies in us wars except france did n't take part in the iraq war . 
  because it 's an independent country , y' know , not some american drone that does it 's master 's bidding . 
  france chose to fuck up on libya on its own accord . 
  did you read your own link ? 
   signalled the start of the iraq ** war **  iraq ** war ** yeah no shit it wasnt an emergency , i was being sarcastic . 
  okay ? 
  but it was still a war . 
  i did n't dispute that attacking iraq was bad , my point is that the iraq * war * was a * war * . 
   it just looks like a horrible place for people . 
  modernism really failed to take human needs into account . 
  it was horrible for pedestrians and the apartment blocs felt really sterile and lifeless . 
  the city itself does look cool and stately , but for actually living there ? 
  no thanks . 
   even the americans build nicer buildings than you guys . 
  tbf the capitol , white house , scotus , lincoln memorial and washington monument are pretty nice looking . 
  neoclassical is kinda hard to screw up . 
  reminds me of brazil 's capital . 
  brasilia was pretty much built from the ground up in the 1950s , so everything there has that modern style . 
  not sure if i like it tbh , it 's interesting but kinda bland after a while . 
   it 's sad , but the uk is no more . 
  oh come on , germany went from being nazi germany to being everyone 's favorite country within a century . 
  yes brexit and anti e.european racism is bad , but it 's not the end of the country . 
  i really hope you are right , but i think being in the younger social bubble may skewer your view a bit . 
  i know i had some skewered views on the societies i 've lived in due to this . 
  what 's your opinion on that sadiq khan drama ? 
  not immigrant related i know , but it seemed really controversial with my canadian and american friends alike . 
  trump 's defense secretary is a big fan of nato and the pentagon is a big fan of getting to use their stuff and getting more funding . 
  a war with a proper enemy to defend your allies ? 
  the dod would be getting trillions in funding and let loose with their shiny toys and research for new toys . 
  i ca n't see them not supporting such a great opportunity . 
   2nd least worst given the mess that is brexit , 2nd least worst is like the best compliment we 've got !, 
  oh yeah i agree , i wish we had our own macron here in the uk . 
  he appears well balanced and his economic policies look pretty good on paper . 
  france has the biggest military budget in europe , and is now going to be the only nuclear power in the eu . 
  they do take defense seriously . 
  i do n't see how the falklands proved that , british manpower is actually superior to argentina 's . 
  israel is a good example though . 
  tough little bastards . 
  the first one is undergoing sea trials atm , but you are right that we do n't have one in active service , which is embarrassing . 
  yeah yeah , our new carriers are n't nuclear powered or catobar , but it was either 1 of those or 2 of the current design . 
  it depends on what you want i guess , the british navy wants 2 acceptable carriers so there 's always 1 available in case one has to undergo maintenance , the french navy wanted one really good carrier but if it has to undergo maintenance then they 're left without one for some time . 
  is n't niger important for france 's uranium supply though ? 
  involvement there kinda makes sense from that pov . 
  yes , the usa only cared about western europe . 
  they did n't save eastern europe because they hate those damn easterners so much ; the presence of millions of red army soldiers had nothing to do with it . 
  the us would n't be negotiating because they would be the ones annihilating the enemy and demanding unconditional surrender . 
  the only way the usa could not win is if their enemies use nuclear bombs , and that still means certain doom for those who did use them . 
  fighting for latvia would be a hard sell , that 's why the pentagon would market it as a war against the old red bear , russia . 
  or if it 's to protect japan/philippines/etc . 
  then market it as a war against the new commie terror . 
  propaganda is not something the usa will have any difficulty with . 
  no love for the uk ? 
  we 're still wanking ourselves raw over ww2 and the falklands . 
  war is our jam . 
  is the french army really in a dire position ? 
  i thought they were better off than the british hmm well , the british army has manpower issues too actually , so the standard is n't very high . 
  it was to be expected . 
  reddit is mostly left wing economically and socially ( evidenced by the massive pro bernie sanders crowd ) , macron is centre-right . 
   healthcare needs to be the main focus of every government i 'd put freedom of speech , movement ( allowed to leave the country ) and access to safe food and water ahead of providing healthcare services .
