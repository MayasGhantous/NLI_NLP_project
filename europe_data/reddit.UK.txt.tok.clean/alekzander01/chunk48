  that 's quite specific . 
  yeah but article 50 has been triggered , whether we can untrigger it is up to the eu . 
  is n't france the eu 's `` second cash cow '' ? 
  or did we contribute more than them ? 
  yep . 
  i wish we had a system similar to the american electoral college , obviously with some tweaks , but i think it would really help out wales and ni ( and ofc scotland ) since politicians would have to appease to them , also the english north which seems to be neglected since the thatcher era, 
  it 's pretty easy to find a nice secluded area , away from everyone else , in brazil . 
  europe is a bit stuffy though so good luck with that, 
  him irl http://www.the7eye.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/10487300_790359014329388_4499807501380660476_n1.jpg, 
  more like a tranquilliser, 
  it 's truly a colossal fuck up , westminster seems incapable of doing anything right when it comes to keeping the rest of the nation happy . 
  is this bait or ? ... 
  well they 're not * my * heroes , i do n't look up to them and hope to be like them someday , but it 'd be lunacy to deny that they 're scottish national heroes . 
  besides , mediaeval politics and grudges matter little in our modern world . 
  france and germany are bffs even though napoleon , france 's own national hero , was occupying and ruling over germany less than 200 years ago ( not to mention those incidents in 1870 , 1914 and 1940 ) . 
  oh god please no . 
  this vicious cycle is what 's gon na keep us with tories in power . 
  commonwealth citizens have an easier time getting into the uk , they 're already allowed to vote as long as they have residency here ( citizenship not required ) . 
  kinda hard to revive coal mining and metallurgy in the west . 
  he did n't bring it up , another user did . 
  imo the uk would really benefit from an electoral college like the american 's . 
  napoleon was n't committing genocide . 
   against the brits * english . 
  scotland was allied with france at the time !, 
  hero ? 
  he gets burned on a bonfire every year , not to mention he was a religious extremist who was more anti-protestant than anti government . 
  william wallace , robert the bruce , lord nelson , wellington and churchill i suppose . 
  yeah the marseillaise is awesome . 
  i wish our national anthem was something else , maybe `` rule britannia '' or `` i vow to thee my country '', 
  reminds me of disraeli 's ( first british jewish prime minister ) famous comeback `` yes , i am a jew , and when the ancestors of the right honorable gentleman were brutal savages in an unknown island , mine were priests in the temple of solomon . '', 
  200 years is very recent though . 
  500 + is when it gets sticky, 
  certain words are banned in parliament ( in order to try and maintain some sense of decorum ) so all the mps have to make up elaborate insults to get around the ban . 
  iirc he was illiterate , i wonder how he spelled his name . 
  is this how we get sweden to back us in brexit negotiations ? 
  is that why everyone likes scotland ? 
  they got us there, 
  fun fact : his skeleton is used for teaching medical lectures at the university of s\u00e3o paulo . 
  well churchill did suggest it https://europa.eu/european-union/sites/europaeu/files/docs/body/winston_churchill_en.pdf, 
  i think a scotland-england divorce would be amicable . 
  i do n't support it happening , but i hope we remain on good terms if it does . 
  wtf ? 
  what do you mean `` cultural legitimacy '' ? 
  is there one for scotland ? 
  oooh fight fight fight, 
  good lord , if the queen died during brexit negotiations the country would descend into anarchy . 
  iirc oxford stories their stuff in an old salt mine ( dry air keeps books safe from decay ), 
  i think the israelis are number 1 at that , sadly :( / #makejamesbondgreatagain, 
  neither does `` liking '' others . 
  i absolutely despise nigel ( thanks to brexit we now have indyref 2 being a possibility ) , but this was quite funny . 
  really ? 
  despite their blatant human right abuses ? 
  pretty much . 
  sweet jesus . 
  imagine what korean unification would cost !, 
   the anglosphere is based on ethnicity so are most european nations . 
  i have german citizenship because my grandparents are germans , that 's literally it . 
  * jus sanguinis * is the norm in europe , * jus solis * is mostly a `` new world '' thing . 
  those are all white ethnicities though , how is it racist for britain to prefer assimilated indians over unassimilated `` fellow '' whites ? 
  how are we not european ? 
  just because we are n't in the eu anymore does n't mean we are n't european culturally . 
  the uk has received from and given to europe since humans first settled in the area . 
  according to de gaulle , he found the quebecois to be quite proud of their french history and very much `` connected '' to france . 
  iirc canadians can vote and hold office in the uk without being british citizens , they just have to live here . 
  we already have the foundations for a closer commonwealth , it 'd be nice to see it grow . 
  well we did give them versailles ii . 
  germany lost more land than ever , losing prussia would be like the usa losing massachusetts or virginia . 
  plus they still had to pay reparations . 
  `` v '' for victory . 
  that 's why churchill was always make that sign with his fingers . 
  because they do n't want them and would rather suffer a massive demographic crisis instead . 
  what was so `` sick '' about germany during that time ? 
  was the reunification really that costly ? 
   english citizenship * double triggered *, 
   `` said the queen of england ... '' * triggered * revoke his citizenship immediately !, 
  well i 'm not sure who scotland 's parents are and sunshine sounds pretty grand , so we 'll just pretend to be a part of new zealand and combine our sheep herding powers . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  the uk got alzheimer and is going to live with his kids in australia and new zealand , the sunshine will do us good . 
  no shit . 
  theresa may herself was also against it . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3348004/what-does-being-british-mean-ask-the-spanish.html you know how the child resembles the father ? 
  its also funny considering that a lot of brits share common ancestry with the basques http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3348004/what-does-being-british-mean-ask-the-spanish.html, 
  that 's glorious . 
  i do n't think the drawings below us would have appreciated though, 
  and we 're the tip of it :(, 
  oh yeah no doubt about that , but i always wished the uk had built closer ties to it 's next door neighbour . 
  yesterday i learned that malta nearly joined the uk , but this is something else !, 
  i somehow doubt the french public would have accepted a return to a monarchy . 
  but as a scotsman , the idea of a super-auld alliance sounds magnificent :p oh what could have been !, 
  with 2 european ex superpowers united , a federal europe would probably come along much more quickly . 
  credit to / u/homo _ culus for leading me to this article . 
  and ireland !, 
  before the war yes , my own dad ( a brit raised in argentina himself ) told me that his first reaction to the news was `` what the hell are the falklands ? '', 
  but now ? 
  everyone knows them exactly because of the war . 
  especially when the top gear crew got shit for their 1982 car plate . 
  what 's the issue with the falklands ? 
  they 're nothing like northern ireland . 
  i know right . 
  clearly philip , duke of edinburgh should be the greek one .
