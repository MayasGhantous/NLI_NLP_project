  how did you come up with that ? 
  it 's so witty and new . 
  i especially like the `` muh '' part instead of `` my '' . 
  that 's genius . 
  mark my words ... this is gon na become a huge internet meme . 
  just you watch . 
  you should be proud that you started this . 
  you 'll forever be written down in history on ` knowyourmeme ' as the genius who came up with this format of `` muh ______ '' . 
  bravo !, 
  so , you 're saying the uk was holding the eu to a standstill in regards to an eu army ? 
  despite them making plans to develop one before we voted to leave ? 
  `` anti-rational '' ? 
  that 's a matter of opinion . 
  you ... literally did the same thing . 
  still better than `` muh eu inturgrayshun '', 
  yeah , but remainers tried to claim that the eu was n't going to make an eu army at all . 
  of course,

  but only 1 way to go down ? 
  are they trying to force us underground ? 
  why no ... * eye twitch * ... right escalator painted and lit up ? 
  good luck searching for pro-indyref2 if she gains power . 
  not that i support it ... but it should be available . 
  or even irish reunification . 
  or anything anti-government for that matter . 
  plc ca n't attack russia or great horde until 1500 . 
  they can now . 
  he voted to leave the eec in 1975 . 
  he 's talked about being anti-eu . 
  whilst that is a nice anecdote of immigration that worked ... what a sad story for those americans that must be . 
  to be left behind by the system in favour of foreign born citizens . 
  sweet . 
  now do pineapple . 
  the us has a strict immigration policy . 
  so , most legal migrants would be very skilled there ... which is not true for the uk . 
  i 'm not anti-immigrant , i 'm anti-immigration ( if that makes sense ) . 
  not even completely so , cause i do n't think it has to be reduced to a net 0 or that every immigrant has to have a doctorate or masters ... but it needs to be kept at sustainable levels at a rate at which the public services can grow in capacity . 
  nice to have a diversity of opinions . 
  people only comment on topics they 're passionate about ... and very few are passionate about being pro-immigration . 
  that would n't even relate to farage since he was n't part of the main leave campaign . 
  he had his own separate campaign . 
  [ yeah ... that 's what you want us to think . 
  considering the population of iceland ; there 's probably more j\u00f3hanns in india . 
  are we just gon na pretend not to notice that malta is home of the borg ? 
  but martin 's tend to be ... special . 
  i 'm on r/europe discord . 
  cheers , mate !, 
  deus vult reported wednesday *, 
  oh , english is english wherever you go . 
  we 're not so intolerant this side of the channel . 
  we respect all forms of the beautiful language . 
  you finally learnt about contextual interpretations ???!!!, 
  so , you did learn something of value today ... bless . 
  no , you did that . 
  '' ` imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness '' , oscar wilde it 's why it makes me glad that you , a german , took the time to learn english  you learnt something of value today about the english language . 
  i hope you hold onto that and continue to imitate our language . 
  it is truly flattering . 
  it 's ... it 's ... it 's ... it 's almost as if i was replying to you !!!, 
  oh the humanity !!!, 
  welcome to the english language . 
  also ,  me : you are basically unarmed  you : you fashioned a weapon are complete opposites . 
  i also called you out , with your broken logic . 
  i gave you plenty to work with but it 's never enough with you ... because you never intended to do any work . 
  you just want to point out that it 's all my fault for not giving you anything to counter , whilst failing to hold your own logic up in the first place . 
  you fashioned a weapon out of a banana peel and continously claim it to be dangerous ... but if i hold a banana peel at you , you laugh and say it 's harmless . 
  look at how desperate you are by saying i 'm clinging to other comments . 
  you know perfectly well that the context vindicates my comments , but you refuse to accept that . 
  you also tried to weasel out of your way of your own logic because you could n't provide evidence of something i said in the same vein as you asking for evidence of something i said . 
  the only difference is that i had context to back me up and you had nothing . 
   i told you why `` blocking everything '' like you said will backfire in the brexit talks and why the uk losing it 's veto power in two years is relevant . 
  you could n't disprove my point , besides quoting other people . 
  i never attempted to disprove that point . 
  unless you can quote me to prove otherwise . 
  i simply stated that the argument for this hypothetical is based on the point that the eu does n't care what the uk says or does , so why would the eu care at all if the uk vetoes everything it does . 
  honestly , you have been entertaining ... like a monkey at the zoo trying to act human . 
  you do n't have to be so angry mate . 
  honestly , i just want to clarify my position . 
  it 's nothing personal against you and i did n't mean to hurt your feelings as i did n't realise you were so delicate . 
  woah calm down mate . 
  lol , you are pissed . 
  it 's just reddit , you do n't have to take is so seriously hahahahaa the thread is what matters , and it 's what started this debate ... you can not call it irrelevant . 
  it 's pretty desperate of you to claim that i 'm desperate lol i gave you the opportunity for a more adult conversation , but you insisted on continuing this childish arrangement . 
  so , do n't act so self-righteous hahahaaha i do n't care if you 're bored . 
  probably cause you do n't have a convincing argument . 
  i 'm enjoying getting the better of you at every turn . 
  so , you conveniently missed out the original comment in this thread . 
  start from there as your base . 
  even after giving you an explanation , do you graciously accept part of the blame ? 
  noooo lol look at you adulting so hard . 
  `` i 'm an adult and you 're stoooopid '' lol you 're cute hahahahahahaha, 
  the point was to show a bizarre hypothetical as a result of the eu not caring what the uk thinks . 
  not for it to be taken seriously . 
  i genuinely thought you did want an adult conversation , so out of courtesy i stopped the `` hahaha 's '' and the `` lol 's '' . 
  but what a facade you built . 
  now you 're saying i 'm triggered and that you 're calling me out lol honestly , saying you called me out is pretty convenient and a novel way of avoiding the point . 
  you 're a slippery one , you ... do n't take the truth because it 's too bitter for you . 
  what a sad , sad man you are hahahahahahahahahhaha, 
  but the original comment states that the eu does n't care about what the uk says . 
  so , we can veto and no one would care .
