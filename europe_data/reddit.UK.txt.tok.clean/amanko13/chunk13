  but the original comment states that the eu does n't care about what the uk says . 
  so , we can veto and no one would care . 
  see , you 're calling me upset and then you get upset when i try to show you that i 'm not by adding a few `` hahaha 's '' and some `` lol 's '' . 
  you 're a hypocrite to your own argument and the fact that you think i 'm upset and pulling things out of my ass is ** your ** interpretation . 
   no need to get down to kindergarten level now , that you are getting called out . 
  it 's ok to make a fool out of yourself , as long as you can learn from that . 
  says the guy who continuously says `` you are upset '' in the hopes that it 's true . 
  you ca n't demand an adult conversation when you 're so keen on acting like a child . 
   seriously now ? 
  that 's something you claimed you did yourself yeah , but looks like you did n't interpret my joke as a joke . 
  you are the first on to say that i called you an idiot ...  you 've already made a progress from calling people idiots i just played along for a laugh cause i thought you were being ironic ... 
  i hope you were . 
  otherwise , you 're just defying your own logic again . 
  okay , i 'll quote you :  given that the uk 's veto power is lost in 2 years , it actually is relevant . 
  what 's relevant ? 
  the fact the uk does n't have vetoing powers for long . 
  which was the argument made for why the uk 's vetoing powers do n't matter . 
  and you 're calling me childish for `` hahahah 's '' and `` lol 's '' when it 's your fault for childishly calling me salty . 
  so i thought maybe i had to lighten my speech a bit more , cause you might actually think i 'm angry or salty . 
  if you did n't want this childeshness ... do n't start it . 
  i took your sarcasm from here :  well , congrats you 've already made a progress from calling people idiots to `` my sweet '' . 
  keep it up . 
  ... as a complaint . 
  but where did i call you an idiot ? 
  huh ? 
  where ? 
  huh ? 
  quote me !, 
  ( i assume this is what you wanted me to ask , since you seem to be trying to prompt me here ) yaar , thoo ingredgi nai sumedganda . 
  no , you ca n't just quote random lines and hopes that solves it lol that does n't quite cut it darling . 
  trying to weasel out of it again ? 
  awww and i was having such fun . 
  quote me on where i said that ** you ** said it does n't matter ? 
  lol that 's that . 
  you do n't have an answer !, 
  you just fucked up by your own logic and you 're trying to weasel your way out of it hahahahahaha this was class . 
  carry on and dig your hole a little deeper please ... it just adds to the fun . 
  if i did n't call you an idiot , then i do n't know what you 're complaining about . 
  that 's what ** i ** thought . 
  ** i ** never said ** you ** said it . 
  so ** you ** ca n't point out something that ** i ** said ? 
   but wait you already admitted that you ca n't also , where did ** i ** admit that ** i ** could n't point out something that ** you ** said . 
  quote ** me ** . 
  well , complimenting yourself was really self-indulgent and retarded . 
  i thought it would be too mean to call you an idiot again . 
  did you even read my comment ? 
  and oh look , you did n't answer my question . 
  i 'll ask again :  where did * i say * that * you said * it does n't matter ? 
  maybe talk to the right people about things they said next time . 
  * yawn * ... that sad , old cliche . 
  if it makes you feel better , my sweet . 
   given that the uk 's veto power is lost in 2 years , it actually is relevant . 
  that 's you defending a comment defending the original comment . 
  i just connected the dots . 
   where did i say it does n't matter ? 
  my answer was `` context '' . 
  if you did n't get that , you might need to brush up on your english darling . 
  it 's still a bit rough . 
  but if you want to be so pedantic , where did * i say * that * you said * it does n't matter ? 
  english is like a stick in your arse ... if you take it too literally , it 's gon na hurt . 
  it was more an observation of your lack of reading comprehension , but i did n't mean to hurt your feelings , as i did n't realise how delicate you must be if you 're using that old defensive mechanism . 
  it would 've been , if it made sense . 
  but the only thing that became clear is his lack of understanding of the english language . 
  yeah , it 's a real brain teaser ... where could i have possibly gotten that notion ? 
  it 's almost as if i looked at the context of this thread . 
  i 'll give you the context , so that you can comprehend and maybe learn how to use context to improve your english speaking skills . 
   and we should care what the uk has to say about what the eu is doing exactly why ? 
  that 's the original comment in this thread and the comment you were defending . 
  that 's what i 'm referring to . 
  then our argument was , if the eu does n't care , then we can just block everything for 2 years . 
  not the end of the world . 
  but i thought it did n't matter to the eu ... since we 're losing our veto powers anyways . 
  why would they care if we block everything ... ? 
  unless you 've changed your tune and are now saying it does matter . 
  okay , the uk will just block everything for 2 years until brexit because it does n't matter apparently . 
  well , i was just generalising as you had done when you were talking about the english accent being boring . 
  the only good thing about the irish accent is that the americans ca n't understand it ... cause it 's certainly not as fun as the australian accent and not as proper as the english accent ( unless you 're talking about the northern heathens ) . 
  not even the welsh can understand the welsh accent and scots are just perpetually angry . 
  perfect . 
  not brexiting hard enough . 
  can we just leave this plane of reality entirely ? 
  reform the empire in the netherworld . 
  so ... everyone but the uk ? 
  that 's very different terminology ... you make it seem like we 're retards calling ourselves european , whilst norweigens are definitely european and no can take that away from them because it 's theirs by right . 
  does the same apply to brits ? 
  cause i think that 's what the original argument was about . 
  you really need n't take it so personally . 
  we made our decision not as a fuck you to the eu ... but what we believe is best for britain . 
  france are biggest traitors !!, 
  * grits teeth * sir , yes sir ... 
  [ curse you moldavians !!!,

  where ??!!, 
  yeah , i like tequila too . 
  good . 
  never speak english again , so i do n't have to listen to your whining . 
  he said in english . 
  being polite to france by sharing that title . 
  there was a lot more pro-eu media than anti-eu . 
  so , please do n't be so patronising .
