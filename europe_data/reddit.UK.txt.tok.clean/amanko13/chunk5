  but even getting more people to vote for their meps would allow for a more democratic union . 
  just no one knows what they actually do . 
  also , i 'm not sure how democratic it can be to vote for someone to vote for someone who votes on whether or not things go through . 
  there must be a point of diminishing returns in terms of democracy . 
  lol i think i heard something like that . 
  i ca n't really remember , but hopefully they were just joking . 
  it 's not cognitive dissonance ... when one wants to retain sovereignty and have a more democratic eu . 
  getting rid of the european council is n't the only option to improve the level of democracy in the union . 
  greater federalisation is n't the only solution for greater democracy . 
  you give people a reason to be anti-uk . 
  that 's what the remain campaign was run on . 
  everyone points to the brexit campaign for lying , but conveniently forget about the lies from the remain camp . 
  well , i know the keynesian bit . 
  is `` milton '' also a term used in economics ? 
  ** kongo ** they shall grow not old , as we that are left grow old : age shall not weary them , nor the years condemn . 
  at the going down of the sun and in the morning , we will remember them . 
  we will remember them . 
  mech is always fashionably late . 
  we should just be ready 15 minutes before it 's hosted like last week . 
  just be glad the both of you did n't grow up in milton keynes . 
  just get your hello kitty from the black market . 
  it 's all about swedish super holes . 
  what has making jokes got to do with that you depressing twat ? 
  why stop there mr. 
  comedy police ? 
  why are people making jokes when people are starving in india ? 
  not interested in pussies , eh ? 
  someone get this guy a dick ... you know , apart from himself . 
  i 'll be expecting a potato attached to some wires ... oh hang on , you do n't have potatoes , do ya ? 
  lol what are you gon na do about it ? 
  i think the point was `` who cares what he thinks cause he 's dead '' . 
  all the extras were unnecessary . 
  and the eu is ? 
  a united kingdom of great britain and ireland would be nice . 
  i 'm a brexiteer ... but i love europe . 
  how do you think we should deal with irun , packistan , east koria , and maddupistan ? 
  not quite that black and white . 
  if it stops my banjo string from getting torn ... then that 's value for money . 
  yes , but let 's not forget he was an old white cis male . 
  if it 's not [ this guy ] ( https://youtu.be/ahawhxzuv8q?t=30m55s ) , i 'll be thoroughly disappointed . 
  lol that 's true . 
  it was kinda funny , but not enough to make me even chuckle . 
  it 's just my opinion ... 
  i do n't think it stands the test of time . 
  you 'll struggle to get kids to watch it . 
  i have no idea how you reached that conclusion . 
  what is it about being frightened that allows us to do the thing that needs to be done ? 
  i was born in ' 95 , it was before my time and every time i see a bit of it , it looks like an aged comedy that is n't worth my time . 
  i saw that episode where they 're pirates going through new york with their ship being a building ... 
  i did n't find it funny . 
  i feel like i 'm alone in that regard . 
  his party was responsible for the 1984 anti-sikh riots which was labeled as a genocide . 
  he and his party have a nice bit of amnesia in that regard too . 
  oh right . 
  i 've never watched monty python . 
  i mean , are you genuinely asking or ... ? 
  lol the fuck 's wrong with you ? 
  edit : never mind , i see you 're a regular user of r/the _ donald, 
  but ... but ... we have the best humour . 
  damn man ... 
  i ca n't find wally anywhere . 
  i was talking about the blitz . 
  do n't give in to the fear . 
  we 've seen worse . 
  this wo n't frighten us . 
  what 's the turkish equivalent of obi-wan ? 
  something about 5 ' 7 that makes you want to conquer europe . 
  i wo n't make fun of you if you have that potential . 
  oh ... guess not . 
  yeah , we all know that now but he 'd be short by today 's standards . 
  the last panel is true though . 
  basically ... humans come in all shapes and sizes . 
  even brexiteers . 
  not even remotely similar . 
  we now need a corsican guy on r/europe to crown himself emperor of france . 
  preferably short . 
  some are agreements for a framework of co-operation . 
  some are commitments made by a country which wishes to join the eu to reform and develop in exchange for tariff free access to some or all eu markets . 
  and some are just customs unions . 
  oh , looks like south africa and georgia have some sort of trade agreement too . 
  that 's the source i used :p only 3 of them are free trade or trade agreements . 
   the cheek of you comparing argentina to great britain . 
  ftfy . 
   the eu already has a lot of trade agreements i count south korea , mexico , and switzerland the only countries the eu has a free trade agreement with . 
  singapore and vietnam have concluded negotiations , but the deal is yet to be signed . 
  we need high loyalty for admin points !, 
  india setting up call centres already ? 
  bloody hell ... that was quick . 
  ** kongo ** feudalism ... bitches . 
  `` of course , these figures are highly uncertain '' - not even the experts are sure about the pros . 
  i do n't think you understand my argument . 
  i 'm not saying refugees will bring about armageddon . 
  but there is , at least , some short term costs to bringing in so many . 
  as well as the increased terror threat ... 
  however , the main crux of my argument is that germany 's handling of the situation was a failure because they quickly regretted letting in so many refugees . 
  they then wanted other countries , whom they made no prior agreement with , to accept those refugees to ease their burden . 
  then also paid refugees to go home . 
  it 's just another reason for the rich and powerful to pat themselves on the back and feel good about themselves , whilst the working class have to suffer . 
  the raf ? 
  do you think the islamists invented terrorism ?
