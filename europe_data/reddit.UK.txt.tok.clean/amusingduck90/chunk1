` bout tree fiddy, 
  we 're no better !, 
  a billion used to be a * million * million , instead of a thousand million . 
  same for trillion , which was a * million million * million . 
  typing this out has made the word * million * lose all meaning . 
  the way you 've described your method means that the coins are laid in pefectly straight rows and columns , right ? 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wyb84h4.png ) ( 400 circles ) is your method . 
  a better method is [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bwpinqn.png ) ( 429 circles in same space ), 
  you put :  in order to fit 2.42 billion on the field you thus need to stack ( 2.42 * 10 ^ 12 ) 2.42 * 10 ^ 12 is 2,420,000,000,000 , which is 2.42 trillion , not 2.42 billion :\\ ^ ), 
  22.5 mm * 3.15 mm = 0.00000125 cubic meters per # $ 2.42 bn = ~ # 2.14 bn = 2675 cubic meters in # coins . 
  2675 / 90.7 * 100 = 2949.28 cubic meters with perfect packing ( thanks / u/robertmurz ! ), 
  # 2.14 bn in # 1 coins would cover wembley 's pitch with a layer roughly 40.7 cm thick, 
  according to wiki , a $ 1 coin is 23.25 mm in diameter and 2.33 mm thick . 
  in meters , it is 0.02325 m in diameter 0.00233 m thick . 
  this gives the volume of a $ 1 coin as 0.000000989 cubic meters . 
  2.42 billion $ 1 coins , with no gaps , would take up 2,393.38 cubic meters . 
  wembley stadium 's pitch is 105 meters by 69 meters . 
  2.42 billion $ 1 coins would be enough to completely cover the pitch in an even layer ~ ~ 33cm ~ ~ 36.4 cm thick ( thanks / u/robertmurz ) . 
  why do n't you take a look at the wiki articles for the afghan/iraq war and see how many `` little eu countries '' participated . 
  hint : most of them, 
   you can not have free trade without freedom of movement . 
  the us does n't have free trade with the eu ? 
  the us has freedom of movement with the eu ? 
  which one is it ? 
  what about egypt ? 
  china ? 
  mexico ? 
  all have free trade with eu , and no freedom of movement that i know of . 
   this is a common misconception in the uk . 
  til canada is a member of the single market, 
   worries for problems the internal uk instability could bring to the world people should be more concerned about the eu instability . 
  capital flight from the southern states to the northern states , for example . 
  target2 is the ridiculous clearing method employed in the eu . 
  unlike most ( all ? ), 
  other clearing mechanisms , the money never actually clears . 
  if i have a barclays bank account , and i transfer # 10 to your lloyds bank account , the money does n't actually transfer immediately . 
  both banks register the transfer with the bank of england , and every day the transfers are reconciled . 
  in this example , at the cut-off point , barclays realise a loss of # 10 and lloyds realise a gain of # 10 . 
  the eu does not work this way . 
  the money does not clear . 
  this is why germany has a target2 balance of * $ 800bn * . 
  if a country like italy ever decides to leave the eu , what is going to happen to their target2 balance ( - $ 350bn ) ? 
  what do you make of the target2 imbalances ? 
  i hope so too . 
  i wrote an absolute wall of text , then pressed cancel . 
  sigh . 
  the gist of it was that i think the media has misled you somewhat . 
  the uk media ( for the most part ) was ** strongly ** in favour of remain . 
  project fear was real , and economic ruin was a sure thing , even before we had actually left the eu . 
  what is `` too many concessions '' ? 
  i do not expect the eu to give us something for nothing . 
  in an ideal world , the eu and uk would agree on the aspects that are mutually beneficial , and the one-sided aspects , there should be give and take to provide an agreement that suits both parties . 
  what there is ( should be ) no place for , is political game playing . 
  yes , thats how i understand it . 
  i 'm not opposed to an exit fee as part of the withdrawl agreement . 
  as long as the agreement is acceptable , and not punitive , i do n't think an exit payment to smooth the transition is unreasonable . 
  i do not think that `` agree to $ x billion before negotiations start '' is an acceptable proposition for us . 
  many non-eu countries have a fta with the eu https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements why does the eu 's political interests outweigh the practical interests of its members ? 
  how are they going to supercede article 50 ? 
   the ft 's jonathan ford takes a different view . 
  he says mr barnier 's cash call is not legally well grounded . 
  as a recent house of lords report notes , when treaties fall away , the commitments attaching to them disappear also . 
  `` article 50 does not provide any provision for an ongoing obligation , let alone one requiring any payments , '' he says . 
  `` quite the contrary , in fact . 
  in its very brevity it points to departure being a clean break . '', 
  exactly . 
  theres no reason it ca n't be a win win . 
  the eu will no longer have the uk holding back it 's goals . 
  i fear that politics will win over common sense , sadly . 
  [ yanis varoufakis described his experience with eu negotiations ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/28/yanis-varoufakis-brexit-advice-theresa-may-avoid-negotiating/ ) . 
  it 's not a promising read . 
  source for that 50 % ? 
  i 'd wager that is the result of the media stoking up the tensions . 
  i do n't think the uk has a problem with * europeans * , we just do n't want to be a member of the * eu * any more . 
  in what way is prioritizing the eu political project over the member 's interests a good thing for the average european ? 
  i think your average greek would have a lot to say about the eu 's priorities , and the average young spaniard too . 
  eu businesses put politics ahead of their performance ? 
  bmw , vw et al wo n't mind losing the sales of [ 1 in 7 ] ( https://fullfact.org/europe/german-cars-uk/ ) of all the cars they make ? 
  really ? 
  that did n't answer the question with the eu 's economy already declining as a percentage of the world economy , losing # 290bn of exports for purely political reasons is acceptable ? 
  with the eu 's economy already declining as a percentage of the world economy , losing # 290bn of exports for purely political reasons is acceptable ? 
  source - https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-has-shrunk-percentage-world-economy/ really ? 
  ... and it wo n't hurt the eu too much for it to be politically acceptable ? 
  how so ? 
  uk is perfectly free to walk away with no deal . 
   the current red line is `` no agreement on that = no negotiation for a new status after the deadline of two years '' yes , that is the eu 's position . 
  if the uk decide that paying an exit fee is also a `` red line '' , then ? 
  what if the uk decides that the exit fee is fine , and we 'll take our share of the eu 's assets that we 've contributed to for the last 40 odd years ? 
   i 've only ever heard of people wanting to negociate the whole security thing . 
  unless you mean freedom to live and work , which has nothing to do with security `` if , however , we leave the european union without an agreement , the default position is that we would have to trade on world trade organisation terms . 
  in security terms , a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened , '' she wrote . 
  the european parliament 's brexit coordinator , guy verhofstadt , responded that meps would not accept any attempt by the uk to use its strength in the military and intelligence fields as a bargaining chip , underlining the complexities that the prime minister will face in achieving a smooth exit from the eu . 
  why would the uk pay a $ 100bn exit fee that we have no legal obligation to pay ? 
  why would the uk agree to pay an exit fee before any negotiations start ? 
  why would the uk agree that eu access to our security services is non-negotiable ? 
  the eu 's solution to the problems in the eu is ... * more eu * . 
  $ 100bn exit fee that we 're under no legal obligation to pay * before negotiations begin * ? 
  security services ca n't be included in negotiations ? 
  no thanks . 
  btw , you might find [ this ] ( https://mishtalk.com/2017/02/24/fuse-is-lit/ ) interesting,
