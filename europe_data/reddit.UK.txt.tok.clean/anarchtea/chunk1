yes . 
  for the oil reserves stat , there was no calculation , that 's a direct quote from the cia factbook . 
  as for the other figures , they are also direct quotes and i 've stated a couple of times the rankings were calculated by removing eu countries that would cease to exist under a single state . 
  others have disagreed with the inclusion of non-country gdps like jersey , but as such economies would n't be counted in the eu total i thought it incorrect to exclude them . 
  these calculations were only needed for the averages -- gdp per cap . 
  and life expectancy -- since everything else is cumulative and totals for the others are bigger than any single constituent . 
  edit : by the same measure , the uk is 30th in oil reserves with 3.12 billion bbl . 
  i used ppp because , having only a basic grasp of economics , the notes from the factbook state that it :  ... is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries . 
  i see where you 're coming from . 
  there are many ways to interpret the data and while they 're not countries and some economists would probably disagree , they are considered to have an individual gdp . 
  jersey , for example , is not a full member of the eu , and does n't contribute to the eu totals , so it i think it should not be excluded when comparing eu statistics against the rest of the world . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're looking at . 
  the gdp per capita listed on the world factbook [ here ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ee.html ) states the eu is 41st . 
  looking at the country comparison [ here ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html?countryname=european%20union&amp;countrycode=ee&amp;regioncode=eur&amp;rank=41#ee ) , there are eleven eu countries ranked above 41st : luxembourg , netherlands , austria , ireland , sweden , germany , belgium , denmark , uk , finland , and france . 
  population and the number of internet users are not proportional to each other . 
  the us has a population of 318.8 million and 245 million users , or 76 % of the population . 
  china has a population of 1.3 billion and 389 million users , or 29 % of the population . 
  some of the stats on the original were close to what the cia and world bank have , but the numbers for both gdp figures were too big and they bumped the ranking up . 
  ( e.g. 
  the gdp per cap . 
  on the original said the eu was 16th . ), 
  one of the reports [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/school/math_en.htm ) ( at the bottom , ` final report of the high-level-group on literacy ' ) makes for interesting reading , particularly on p. 22 . 
  these rankings are for the eu not competing against its constituent states . 
  for cumulative statistics ( e.g. 
  population , gdp ) , the eu number will always be bigger than any one of its states , so the resulting rank is also higher and does n't need to be recalculated . 
  gdp per capita and life expectancy are averages and the ranking shown is a recalculation by removing any countries that rank higher . 
  yesterday i cross-posted a similar graphic from / r/mapporn and it was deleted , rightfully , for not being reputable . 
  it 's good to know this sub has critical eyes moderating it . 
  so i pulled data from the world factbook and the world bank 's databank and came up with this . 
  adult literacy does n't have a ranking as i could n't find a reliable table . 
  the ranking for averages ( gdp per capita , life expectancy ) has been adjusted to remove countries that would cease to exist . 
  the world factbook ranks the eu at 35th for life expectancy , but this table also includes countries within the eu , eleven of which are ranked higher than 35th . 
  therefore , the eu would be 24th . 
  technically , i 've visited five countries beyond great britain but it does n't feel like it .
