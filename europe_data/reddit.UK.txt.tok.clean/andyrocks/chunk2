  i believe the majority of the british challenger 2s are indeed based in germany . 
   there was no threat to the citizens of the falklands . 
  the argentinians were quite happy to let them live there . 
  we do n't know that . 
  argentina had a fascist military government at the time who executed many of its own people . 
  it 's certainly possible that once the occupation had settled down they may have tried to relocate the population , or worse . 
   to be fair , that 's kinda what you guys did to ireland , scotland , the 13 colonies , canada , australia , india , south africa , and so on . 
  that 's what happens when you 're a small neighbor of a large country . 
  i 'd love to hear how you think we bullied canada and australia . 
  whatever you do do n't go there and say that . 
   i , personally , would hold our scientists in much higher regard - stephen hawking , charles darwin , david attenborough , alan turing and the likes . 
  you ca n't seriously put attenborough in the same league as darwin . 
  also , where 's newton ? 
  none of what you wrote is true . 
   england britain . 
   england britain . 
  god dammit . 
   to claim germany started ww1 ist just wrong it is absolutely correct . 
   this is pretty much the reason the uk guaranteed belgium no it was n't . 
  the british did n't want the germans to control the channel ports , where an invasion of the uk backed by the high seas fleet would have been a grave possibility . 
   i think the remembrance of wwi should be about the overall pointlessness of world war one and not about soldiers from one side correct , however the war was popular at inception in britain . 
  queues formed hundreds of yards long at recruiting stations to `` help defend plucky little belgium '' . 
   in uk media the cause for so many deaths of commonwealth soldiers is almost always blamed firmly upon british command . 
  that 's a shame , it 's not true , and it 's not a view held by modern historians . 
   the nuclear warheads will work as they are very straightforward . 
  that is not true . 
  nuclear weapons are sensitive weapons that will not function unless the entire set of components works as designed . 
  they are also perishable , in that some of the nuclear material degrades over time , and that components are affected by being close to high levels of radiation . 
  tritium has a short half life , metals get embrittled due to the neutron flux , and so on . 
  if any of the primary or secondary stages do not work exactly as designed then you 're looking at either a dirty bomb or a little fizzle . 
   in 10 years we 'd have a simple common language aside from all the people who no longer go to school . 
   tell that to africa , to gypsies , to any ethnic minorities , to the indians . 
  every economy and society works differently . 
  in the west there is often a correlation between economic performance and birth rates . 
  scott living in england , it 's definitely a thing ... 
  it 's fucking great . 
   the point is : why make up stories if there were enough real negative stories ? 
  that 's not my point ( and has a very obvious answer ) . 
  my point is that all news sources have bias , including pro-eu . 
  a glimpse it may be but that 's hardly the whole story . 
  pointing me towards a blog where examples are cherry-picked to show this hardly proves the point . 
   that 's just semantics sorry . 
  what is just semantics ? 
  what do you mean by that ? 
   the point is that a significant number of anti-eu stories are blatantly incorrect my point was that all sides have bias . 
  just because they are on your side does n't mean they lack bias . 
   within a british context , a paper which simply reported the truth would be considered pro-eu thats a huge generalization about news . 
  what ` truth ' ? 
  the eu is complex enough that a paper can report truth on the eu consisting entirely of negative stories . 
   even the ** pro-eu media ** view the facts through a political filter . 
  yes , they do . 
  that 's implicit in your statement . 
  ah i see what you mean . 
  geographically it 's entirely contained within greater london . 
  what ? 
  how can the city not be in greater london ? 
  an accent from britain . 
  it 's perfectly acceptable to say that . 
   i would say that the us and the uk , even australia , are far worse in the crazy meter progression line no way is the uk as crazy as the us , italy , greece , or france . 
  industrial scale ? 
  what exactly do you mean by that and can you back it up with sources ? 
  while i do n't doubt a lot if nastiness happens i can not agree that the uk is assassinating on an ` industrial scale ' whatever that may be . 
  you 're not coming to london ? 
  crikey , a politician doing what the people who voted for him wants ? 
  the utter bastard !, 
  `` ex-british soldiers '' means soldiers who are longer british . 
  `` british ex-soldiers '' means ex-soldiers are british . 
  ex-british ? 
  why change the title ? 
  more likely it 's the whole island thing . 
  i think they mistranslated warships . 
  not to mention british airbases . 
   would ** directly ** lead to innocents being killed by the resultant fallout . 
  people are n't killed the the political fallout of chemical weapons . 
  they 're killed by the chemicals . 
  i see what you 're trying to do here but i do not believe that is the meaning you intended . 
  chemical weapons do n't have fallout . 
   or they could dig their heals in and tell spain to go fuck itself . 
  which is exactly what they 'd do . 
  british people do not like being bullied . 
   i. . . what ? 
  how are these equally valid ? 
  dude is n't a lawyer . 
   hugely biased toward the english side on this british . 
  and that may be because the gibraltarian claim is much stronger than the spanish . 
  each eurozone member . 
   yes our exports have dropped , but the fact that other countries seem to be able to cope whilst ours is suffering suggests that the majority of the problem is internal rather than external . 
  which ones are doing better ? 
  we 're doing * ok * , and a lot better than some . 
  not at all like that , no . 
  he killed himself . 
   the values of the english are markedly different from scottish , welsh and irish values , and a lot more in line with the other four eyes . 
  are they ? 
  i do n't see any problem with the term anglo-saxon to describe the uk & us , it 's not accurate but it is * understood * . 
  english is the language of business , you 're splitting feathers . 
   the only statutory/official language in the uk is welsh , and only in wales . 
  business in a lot of the world is spoken in english , so i 'm not sure that really helps . 
  that 's fascinating , sorry i did n't fact check that before i commented . 
   and while there are a few people who speak welsh who do n't speak english ( in parts of south america , iirc ) , the problem is n't about immigrants , the problem is about the welsh ( and other minority language-groups ) ; they are being told that they 're not important enough for ukip ( or whoever ) to consider , and that their language ( and thus culture ) is n't important . 
  i do n't agree that they are being told this , this is a far step from making immigrants speak english .
