  it 's a shame the popular image of them is one of incompetent duffers miles from the front line ceaselessly throwing their troops onto barbed wire covered by machine guns . 
  there was a great deal of tactical innovation throughout the war and they really did try , repeatedly , to break the german lines in novel ways . 
   more british men were killed in that one wwi battle than the u.s. lost from all of its armed forces and the national guard combined not true . 
  60,000 * casualties * includes wounded , missing and taken prisoner , it 's not just deaths - there were 16,000 british deaths on that first day of the somme , and perhaps 95,000 during the whole battle . 
  the us had around 116k killed for the whole war ( depending on how you count it ) .

   english british , for fuck 's sake . 
   i do n't think the royal air force existed either , it was called the royal air corps . 
  royal flying corps , and the raf was created in 1918 . 
  would n't have taken you more than two clicks to find that out before posting . 
   i 'd say that amounts to main combatant level for a short time though . 
  the contribution is orders of magnitude lower . 
   almost all the blame goes on british leaders i do n't look upon the british generals as being as bad as their popular image , but holy fuck the french had some awful ones . 
   it 'll be us/uk on the western front if i was french i 'd be insulted as fuck about this . 
  the us did next to nothing compared to the french . 
  france is bacon . 
  `` english queen '', 
  that does not stop them issuing their own currency . 
  ridiculous . 
  sorry , but what right does the eu have to legislate on gun control ? 
  yes , it 's hardly a great solution - but it is possible . 
  they can not do this under the euro . 
  they can , and have , done this with the drachma . 
  i have no idea what you mean . 
  oh i know , i was only kidding , 
   governments can not magic money out of thin air they can if they have their own currency . 
  it 's a joke . 
  is n't poland in eastern europe ? 
  it has a ring of truth about it . 
  it 's really not that hard . 
  if you ca n't see do n't overtake . 
  unproductive chanting ? 
  what on earth does that mean ? 
  i guess we may see !, 
  are you going to make a point ? 
   apples to pears comparison . 
  indeed , i was being flippant . 
  i agree with you . 
   tell that to ukraine . 
  i could , but it 'd still be bullshit . 
   `` uk will cause breakup of the eu . '', 
  no but it might begin the process by fatally undermining confidence in it . 
   sovereignty does n't exist . 
  clearly it does . 
   the world anarchy operates by the strong and the weak . 
  you 've jumped off the deep end . 
   we have a chance to enforce the rule of law on this continent , and we should take it . 
  you talk as if the continent is lawless , and the eu is the only solution , which is clearly bullshit . 
   you 'll be losing sovereignty to another greater power instead well that depends does n't it . 
  deciding to co-operate with a foreign nation does n't mean you have lost sovereignty , only passing laws which give that nation authority over your nation does . 
  being part of nato for example implies no loss of sovereignty . 
  we commit to a treaty , we may base foreign troops , but at no time do we hand the ability to pass laws to nato . 
  that 's what people mean by lost sovereignty , the inability of national parliaments to legislate over policy areas that have been handed to the eu . 
   unless you 're a nuclear power , national sovereignty is a 19th century myth . 
  clearly false . 
  also , sovereignty in this argument is not a binary thing - having it nor not having it . 
  you can cede some sovereignty , you can win some back . 
  it 's not all-or-nothing . 
   if you have no means to guarantee your own sovereignty , you do not have it , whether you 're a formal member of a union or not . 
  what do you mean by guarantee ? 
  through military means ? 
  i have no idea what you 're saying here . 
  iceland is not part of the eu , has no military , and is clearly a sovereign nation . 
   federalism forced down the throat backfires tell that to the confederates, 
   not sure about many other eu countries , but my student visa application to get into the uk was no walk in the park . 
  neither was my j1 for the states when i was a student , however that was a while ago now . 
   the eu was considering removing/limiting visa free us and canadian travel this is only for the schengen area , right ? 
  is it ?

  it often feels like it . 
  you 've really been fighting your corner in this thread , and you 've made some great arguments in the face of the pseudo-enlightened . 
    do you think you are more connected with your nation state because of historical reasons ? 
   historical , ethnic , traditional , same language and living in the same country understanding how the irish work and whats best for us . 
  i 'm amazed that people seem so shocked by this . 
  it 's been the natural state of humanity , everywhere , throughout it 's entire history to align to the group you ethnically , culturally , and geographically relate to the most . 
   the eu is setup as a classic bicameral system there is nothing `` classic '' about the setup of the eu . 
  if it wants to be popular and relevant , that army has to fight and win a war . 
   why do eu politicians seem to hate voters so much ? 
  they do n't rely on them for their power . 
   wait a sec , there was another country that roamed the world with its empire before the british expansion ah yes , the portuguese !, 
   ( maybe some piece of clothe or an handkerchief , ca n't remember what exactly ) . 
  it was the flight engineer 's hat , on the last flight of that aircraft . 
  he stuck it in there deliberately to leave a memento on the aircraft . 
  i believe it 's the concorde up at seattle now . 
  the hat has been since stolen . 
  scotland was not a colony . 
  it 's not just the uk that objects , for one thing . 
  so not a consensus then . 
  gibraltar is not part of the uk . 
  not surprised that we did n't like the nivelle offensive , it was an unmitigated disaster . 
  either works . 
  `` string '' is a keyword , `` string '' is a type , they can be used interchangeably . 
  ginger ? 
  england has no presence in international politics . 
  the country that does is the uk . 
   we have the manpower , money and there are still many frontiers `` we do n't want to fight , but by jingo if we do ... '', 
  ah , great point , i see what you mean , indeed we do . 
  when have the british done this at election time ? 
  aberdonian ?
