what has this got to do with human rights records regarding migrant workers - the statement at hand is ` to be fair , noone in the me does ' to ` israel does n't give a fuck about palestinian citizens ' , ie equating the active forcible theft of palestine itself from palestinians by israel , to the less-than-perfect handling of palestinian refugees . 
  considering your history i am surprised that you 're going out of your way to reinforce a statement that israel is simply no different to arabs in its treatment of palestinians . 
  there are a lot of issues with how countries have treated the palestinian diaspora , but it is absolute bs to equate israel 's racist , murderous settler-colonialism to the arab world poorly handling palestinians refugees . 
  a palestinian treated as a second-class citizen in lebanon = / = a gazan incinerated by white phosphorus by the idf . 
  if they did n't care they would n't have been there in the first place . 
  palestinian diaspora getting caught up in the politics of a nation = / = ` not caring about the palestinians just like the israelis ' . 
  the very link you posted said as many left when saddam invaded due to iraqis , obviously a matter of being caught in the middle of a conflict . 
  again , would n't have 400k palestinians residing for decades if they did n't care . 
   noone in the me does if they can help it . 
  * jordan 3,240,000 * syria 630,000 * lebanon 402,582 * saudi arabia 280,245 * egypt 270,245 * qatar 100,000 * kuwait 80,000 * iraq 57,000 * yemen 55,000 * libya 44,000 * algeria 4,030 ? 
  where are these palestinians refugees being turned away . 
  countries like jordan and lebanon have taken in palestinians , are now taking in syrians , with limited resources , land , and means . 
  that 's not being fair because it 's not true . 
  nor is it fair because it is israel , and not , say , oman , which is colonising palestine and periodically dropping banned weapons on palestinian civilians . 
  that 's what communism did to the eastern bloc and democratic socialism to scandinavia . 
   the allies , though also brutal , ** lacked the institutional love for allowing vengeance ** --  i 'd say there is a difference between bombing - ** an act of organised war ** and rape - an act of individual savagery . 
  your argument was that it was about ** institutional ** revenge , i then point out the utter incineration of japan and germany by the western allies , and then it 's apparently about the ` individual savagery ' of the russian soldier . 
  it 's a lot easier to say that as a latvian , you hate russia , and russians , and what happened in wwii in latvia at their hands , than to swing your argument from one extreme [ institutional evil ] to the other [ individual savagery ] . 
  germany 's plans for eastern europe were der hungerplan to let the vast majority starve to death , then plant german settlers using slavs as slave labour , and finally when the planters were firmly settled , either liquidate or deport the remaining slavs . 
  [ it 's also fantasy that western allies did n't rape german women ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/book-claims-us-soldiers-raped-190-000-german-women-post-wwii-a-1021298.html ) . 
  while i disagree with that number , this idea that ` the allies did n't rape ' is just out and out a deluded lie . 
  it was n't ignored , it was the same period that the eu was doing nothing about ethnic cleansing on its own doorstep - everyone was kinda busy scratching their head at what were essentially ` domestic ' issues to be able to do something about a domestic civil war in the teetering rump state of the soviet union . 
  should we have invaded nuclear power russia ? 
  people paid attention , people condemned , but it was n't some turning a blind eye . 
   the allies , though also brutal , lacked the institutional love for allowing vengeance and bloodshed as the germans and russians did . 
  is this a joke - the allies incinerated at least hundreds of thousands and likely over a million japanese and german civilians through institutional vengeance , for pearl harbour and the blitz . 
   worse than the western allies for sure western allies incinerated hundreds of thousands of people in raids that were dubious in their strategic necessity and were in many respects , revenge pure and simple . 
  i do n't really understand how a lack of discipline among soldiers is worse than how the top brass orchestrates 24/7 firebombings . 
  russia destroyed a russian city and rebuilt a russian city . 
  syria is n't going to have the domestic means to rebuild to that degree , and it 's unlikely the international community will do anything more than pay lip service to the idea of rebuilding . 
  when help is offered it will likely be to exert influence over the country - expect saudi and the gulf states to offer to build schools or religious institutions solely in order to mold syria 's next generation . 
   neo-colonial love how if you try and call western interests in the third world ` neo-colonial ' , you 're a leftist loon , but ofc someone on the left thinking poland should n't have been admitted into nato is an act of neo-colonialism . 
  lmao . 
  nkrumah et al obviously had whether poland would be allowed to host american weapons systems or not in mind when formulating it . 
  implying romanians are n't considered a non-european rabble by ` old europe ' lol . 
  feel free to side with w.european reactionaries but they do n't think anything of you and give less than a damn about you - you 're not even ` better the devil you know ' - that 's poland et al. 
  the people that think w.europe is going to end up a collection of emirates think a pinch better of romania - but only a pinch . 
  what you decide to throw your weight behind is your business but do n't be under any illusions . 
  ironies of ironies , rather than realise the bourgeoisie are now importing cheap third world labour so that social/cultural/religious / racial conflicts will divide the working-class even moreso , and in reaction counter it by * not * deciding decades of issues are to be blamed on recent migrants and instead put blame where blame should be put ... recognise aggression as aggression etc. . . they turn to the right and divide themselves . 
  there is a sizable proportion of the population intelligent enough to recognise * cui bono * , and they with aplomb play straight into the plan as if they 're part of it and not the victim of it . 
  they 'd rather charge windmills than deal with reality . 
  it 's interesting because ofc in conspiracy circles , it 's well documented how many clinton critics have died in accidents . 
  i 'm pretty sure most people think they 're quacks . 
  but they 'll believe any dead critic of putin was killed by putin . 
  i 'm inclined to believe that if someone believes one is an absolute certainty and the other is an impossibility , they 're talking through ideology . 
  does n't matter which they believe and which they write off . 
  just kneejerk reaction to both . 
  [ it 's a dutch milkmaid ] ( http://www.fancythatcostumes.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/milkmaid-long-blue.png ), 
  does n't fit the narrative of the brave individuals rejecting socialism with love , truth , and justice however . 
  the soviet bureaucracy was so calcified rather than reform as it should have under the situation , it snapped , and the buck was passed to a degree where we saw what happened happen . 
  as / u/yesimglobal also mentions , berlin wall is another similar situation of buck passing and lack of a communication = in the western media , some sort of brave revolution of liberated individuals . 
  that 's not to take away from anything that happened but rather to state that what happened was obviously incredibly editorialised by people who were and are ideological enemies of that state . 
  there 's a difference between interfering and controlling . 
  interfering in the democratic process is totally different to controlling the democratic process . 
  there 's a reason half the pics subreddits have ` porn ' in their name , it 's a by-word for something titillating , gratuitous , graphic , etc etc. 
  teenage boys watching those sorts of videos are engaging with the same fantastical as well as unemotional and brutal urges as pornography , which by definition is unemotional . 
   it was supposed to show how easy it is to smuggle guns from ukraine into romania and then to isis . 
  ` we paid these men to pretend to be gun smugglers - it 's really that easy to meet one ' if anyone wants me to pretend to be a gun smuggler in the uk to show just how easy it is to meet one , pm me . 
  [ also sky is really not having a great time atm , along with that * `` this church says ` all welcome ' - if i 'd have been isis with several ak-47s , that entire church would be slaughtered '' * piece they did . ], 
  wales should be mentioned because like cornwall they could n't have possibly bit the hand that feeds them more . 
  cornwall voted massively to leave despite being big recipients of eu funding . 
  apparently the appropriate cornish authority asked the leave campaign to assure funding would continue post-leave , which , lmao , not on your nelly - the uk has no reason to and the leave campaign has zero authority . 
  the uk may have screwed itself but none more inexplicably than the welsh and cornish . 
  scotland 's working on reanimating de gaulle to elect as president to be the one to veto them . 
  you just said yourself a referendum is ` one of the most problematic ways to make a political decision ' . 
  what you 've now argued is how remain should have fought [ when i was talking about him using refs not losing refs ] - well if there was only ever one reasonable answer then it should n't have been a referendum , should it . 
  no politician should ever put to the people ` right , there 's the right decision , and a planless fuck-up ; have a think we 'll vote it out in two months ' . 
  cameron did so for the reckless reason that he believed it was a sure bet and he 'd use that sure bet not for the good of the country but for political collateral . 
  he should n't have ever put the eu ref in the manifesto , and chances are he did it expecting another coalition seeing as one was forecasted . 
  we 're here very simply because he played a dangerous game , and i stick to my point , he is a gambler . 
  cameron has used referendums as political leverage ` here let the people decide - and let me make sure we scare the people ' . 
  the scots ref was shameful , the degree of hostility and scaremongering that came from government . 
  we 've had them because he thinks they 're a sort of political sledgehammer with which he can smash though his political problems . 
  he 's been playing double-or-quits with the fate of the union . 
  * a conservative * , no less . 
  cameron 's got a gambling problem , worried we 'll see him on channel 5 at 3am playing poker when he eventually quits . 
  squatters rights innit m8 - we want the room without the rent . 
  we bombed it too if that has any affect on ownership . 
  maybe that 's more ` pwnership ' though . 
   this soon-to-be abortive coup ... 
  he 'll only go away if he resigns , and he wo n't resign unless he loses a ge . 
  i would like to think so , but they can act like this again and again and it 's a lot harder to replace dozens of mp than it is to replace on leader and a vocal fringe of the party - which ofc they did before with militant , which was far more popular and powerful than corbyn 's clique . 
  they 're not all idiots - many are in marginals that will be lost if actually left-wing candidates are fielded in their place . 
  they know what they 're doing and have intentionally made a point of stopping corbyn putting favourable to him candidates in the selection lists . 
  corbyn is accused at the same time of being a joke that nobody outside of the socialist worker listens to , who hates the country , and of being a loud voice that had the country listening and did n't say enough . 
  the labour frontbench were n't exactly setting the world on fire with their referendum presence themselves . 
  where was hilary benn and his bad churchill impression ? 
  labour are deluding themselves that their issue is corbyn and not something deeper in the party . 
  corbyn 's remain pitch may have been tepid but surely considering he 's in his heart a brexiter you 'd not rely on him to be the party 's voice on the issue . 
  someone like benn could have positively picked up the slack and showed himself to be a leader through positive action , instead they stay quiet hoping he 'll fail and then look to get rid of him through backroom politics . 
  it 's utterly negative and illustrates finely labour 's inherent issue , a total lack of leaders , or people of principle to can speak to the heartlands they have so clearly utterly lost . 
  why over-dramatic when plans to oust him started literally before he was even elected ? 
  they put their heads in the sand and insisted the hundreds of thousands who joined were tory and anarchist agent provocateurs . 
  how 's that outlook for ` legitimate ' ? 
  they insisted he got elected because of tories and anarchists . 
  they set out a load of conditions for his shadow cabinet and wanted him out after benn jr 's cod churchill impression over ~ ~ fighting on the beaches , fighting on the hills , for freedom and democracy , for harry and st george ~ ~ bombing syria . 
  the lib dems , the sizeable third party of uk politics , entered into government and were obliterated at the polls . 
  that would indeed suggest that we have a two party system that makes a shambles of third parties , because the one time they get power , it kills them . 
  the liberal democrats are now perhaps even more in the wilderness than the mid-20th century liberals they replaced . 
  it took them several elections and decades to get to the point of jointly grasping power with one of the two parties , and now they 're eight irrelevances in parliament .
