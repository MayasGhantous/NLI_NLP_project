to be fair islam is worse than catholicism with regards to being socio-culturally regressive . 
  there absolutely is . 
  almost all rich countries can not support an infinite population . 
  maybe the us , maybe germany , but not many . 
  there are countless reasons as to why they ca n't , ranging from social , to economic , to environmental factors . 
  is it morally acceptable to only help some and not others ? 
  who gets the distinction ? 
  ultimately , these people were born into societies moulded by their ancestors . 
  if they did a bad job , that 's on them . 
  it is now their turn to work to provide a better environment for their future kin . 
  otherwise how does a country grow , if its people just run to better places ? 
  look at europe in , say , the 1100s . 
  people were n't really running to the middle east for a better life . 
  they stuck it out , worked hard , got lucky , and now have provided a good place for their ancestors to live . 
  and are throwing it away similar to how the middle east did in recent centuries . 
  in a couple hundred years when europe is on the backfoot and china or whichever other hegemony lords over the world , what will the response be then ? 
  do the chinese * owe * the rest of the world something because their ancestors worked hard to bring them a country that they can enjoy the riches of ? 
  i do n't see the logic , moral or otherwise , of giving away what people in the past literally gave their life to provide for their ancestors . 
  ask your peasant great-great-great-great grandfather if he worked fields for 16 hours a day so someone from the middle east could come and live off the land . 
  this moral superiority complex is simply a european reaction to their own affluence . 
  in time , when said richness is waning , they will look back and lament their naivet\u00e9 . 
  limit to how people can live ? 
  you mean how many ? 
  population limits absolutely have to be monitored , and indigenous birth rates should be raised rather than looking outside for migrants . 
  mass immigration damages both the host country , and the country that sees population flee . 
  it makes countries that are currently worse off , struggle to progress , as their host population leave for greener pastures . 
  danes ' ancestors worked their asses off to provide for their families a country that was strong and wealthy and protected . 
  why give that away to people whose ancestors have done nothing to further the country ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  it 's charity , but it 's kinda offensive to those in the past who have sacrificed everything to provide for future generations . 
  guns are super rare here . 
  even the people that are supposedly packing do n't realise that most of theirs do n't work, 
  it 's survival of the fittest ascertained through inexorable human onslaught . 
  not exactly what i 'd consider a natural situation . 
  wait ... are you saying turkey is more powerful than any current eu nation ? 
  germany 's been biding its time . 
  the time has come . 
  with a western front now backing it its victory is inevitable, 
  we 're poor as fuck m8, 
  he mad/10, 
  anecdotally , i get much better internet in finland than sweden or the uk . 
  even in the deep woods i can get 10mbps down . 
  in sweden and the uk i do n't even get 3g in rural areas . 
  these are all hilarious , both yours and medborgaren 's . 
  nordic humour < 3, 
  blacks are n't the only minorities - middle-easterners are more culturally prohibitive . 
  you ca n't expect to take on a massive population of people from worse-off countries , and place them in better countries , and expect it to make things better . 
  unless you 're a country with a significant minority population who abuses the minorities , like the middle eastern nations , some far-east ones , and the richer african states . 
  in terms of amount of non-whites in france , it can damage social ease and community spirit , prompting people to take more extreme political opinions as is currently being seen . 
  worse , i think , is that it is at the cost of the current french population - why take on so many immigrants ? 
  why not just try harder to make their countries better ? 
  flooding countries with foreign people was never going to end well , i do n't know what europe was/is thinking . 
  immigration is fine but you ca n't go crazy with it - at our rate , something like 25 % of the population will be non-white british/other by 2040 , which is too big a minority and will lead to massive social issues . 
  i 'm liberal but people must be reasonable/rational about immigration . 
  do n't worry buddy , i understood your original comment and thought it was funny xx, 
  i know this feel , i visit the nordic countries a lot because of ties with them . 
  they feel quite empty and massive , though , which freaks me a little bit , with their sprawling black forest . 
  iceland is more open and beautiful though so i 'd imagine it 's similar to england in its quaintness . 
  in my experience from living in the country , people see germans as a mythic people . 
  they 'll eye you with distrust and wonder . 
  just act genially reserved and you 'll be fine . 
  yeah i mean to be honest i 'd rather live in a decent part of a decent city in sierra leone than live most places 150 years ago ... 
  i was just being facetious, 
  some parts of africa are pretty fucked . 
  i doubt many people in the uk , france , germany , spain or italy 150 years ago would want to live in sudan , the congo , sierra leone , or eritrea . 
  true , and statistics show that there are many safer countries , but there 's something about the quaintness of england - especially the countryside - that fosters feelings of comfort and security . 
  best thing about england imo ( have n't lived in scotland/wales/ireland so idk about there ) is that , provided you 're not in a super-poor neighbourhood of a big city , it 's incredibly safe . 
  i 've lived all over the world and i 've never felt safer ( combination of atmosphere and statistics ) than in england . 
  inbetweeners movie captures the lower-middle/middle classes quite well in a suburban setting, 
  the north 's stagnated/regressed iirc . 
  the city only keeps growing . 
  mid and south pretty slow growth but not too negative i think . 
  mate i 'd live in a fucking cardboard box outside tescos in london over living in a two bedroom all to myself in bradford . 
  for someone unaware , what advantages are they ? 
  out of interest who gives the best/most valued ratings ? 
  moody 's , standard n poor , etc. . . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  my grandmother used to say ` palaataan asiaa ' ( apologies for poor spelling ) . 
  i always figured it meant ` let 's discuss options ' , or ` let 's think about our ideas ' . 
  have i been wrong all this time ? 
  corruption is n't too bad in the nordic countries ; centre the industry around there . 
  oh ok , did n't catch that . 
  congrats on the success , i 'll check it out next time i 'm over if i 'm in the south , it 's actually not too far away from my homes . 
  why did they choose finland ? 
  excellent tech track record for its size , to be fair . 
  how does this work ? 
  if someone is born without a dick/pussy or with both , do they just go with it ? 
  suomi : ** kahdeksan ** , ** yo ( with umlauts on the o ) ** . 
  god it 's a weird language . 
  in my defense , i 'm a 2nd language * speaker * , i ca n't really write finnish , so apologies if the spelling 's a little off . 
  incredible how sharp the divide between germany , italy and austria is compared to the eastern nations . 
  thanks , russia, 
  i do n't understand how germany does it . 
  it might sound naive , but why ca n't everyone follow their example ? 
  yes , but compared to the us it 's a non-issue . 
  on a personal level it 's obviously important - they 're a big economy and military . 
  they are n't comparable to the us in either way , though , which is something i see a lot and it annoys me . 
  also , they 're headed towards a major economic downturn . 
   people still thinking russia are a threat the us has left them so far behind it 's a wonder people talk about russia as if it 's relevant at all . 
  see sights in amsterdam .
