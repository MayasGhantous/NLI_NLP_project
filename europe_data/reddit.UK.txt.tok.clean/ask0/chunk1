its their duty to inform themselves and become educated on matters that affect the public . 
  its their job and they are proving to be incompetent . 
  there is no excuse for supporting acta , and any similar shit the tories put in front of them . 
  i am going to be writing to them to cancel my membership ( out of habit ) and will joint the pirate party instead . 
  keeping the internet free is the one thing i expected them to do . 
  if they cant be bothered to be informed , or if they are persuaded to side with the tories on the new internet laws then i am out . 
   but that is what is happening , with the memorandum , and the response is very widespread hostility . 
  the greeks from what i hear are more resentful towards their leaders . 
  i do think they are aware how how corrupt their system is and how inefficient , and i imagine they want change . 
  but the austerity measures are damaging their society . 
  there would be hostility if you lost your job , if you had no prospects , if your nhs didnt provide essential services etc etc. 
  you need to bring in changes gradually , its a cultural change as well that is required and it cant happen overnight . 
  i agree with all that , but the uk is a little bit more desperate in regards to that special friendship . 
  the uk bends over a lot more then other nations . 
  and the uk deludes itself about the nature of the friendship - essentially the uk is the naive girl confusing love with sex . 
  what exactly is that hold that the us has over the uk , and what does the uk get out of it . 
  the british go as far as to delude themselves and become sentimental about the benefits of that special friendship because they cant face the truth . 
  an article by bbc regarding blair 's current standing he was popular and got elected three times , but he is no longer popular in the uk . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-15092475 edit : his popularity on r/unitedkingdom http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/vu6q0/five_years_after_leaving_power_tony_blair_wants/, 
  you may disagree with me but the his poll ratings were dismal and he had to resign to save what was left of the labour party . 
  that is fact . 
  yes , he was elected three times only because people did not have any other viable alternative - the tories were considered unelectable after the damage they did to the economy when they were in power . 
  from wikipedia article : ** events prior to resignation ** as the casualties of the iraq war mounted , blair was accused of misleading parliament , [ 81 ] [ 82 ] and his popularity dropped dramatically . 
  [ 83 ] [ 84 ] the labour party 's overall majority in the 2005 general election was reduced to 66 . 
  as a combined result of the blair-brown pact , iraq war and low approval ratings , pressure built up within the labour party for blair to resign . 
  [ 85 ] [ 86 ] if you read an article about blair in the guardian , the telegraph , the independent , the top voted comment will always be the one which is highly critical of blair . 
  i read many papers and the one thing that unites the readers is their dislike for blair , the right hate him for his policies , the left for his policies and hypocrisy , the moderates see him as self serving , and i am not even including the special hatred the average daily mail reader reserves for him . 
  i would be very interested where you get your information regarding blair being popular nowdays and well liked by the british public . 
  i am not a political expert but i would define it as anything that affects us , tangible or non tangible . 
  it would go against our interests if the costs outweigh the benefits - something unfavorable . 
  it could be doing something we would not necessarily do that would make us appear hypocritical and lose favour , or goodwill . 
  an example is the extradition treaty between the us and the uk : http://www.google.co.uk/#q=us+extradition+treaty+with+uk&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=nws&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=bg_vt8okecfx8qo51kmpdq&amp;ved=0cbyqqai&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.cf.osb&amp;fp=b89008533e522d69&amp;biw=1200&amp;bih=638 http://www.whtimes.co.uk/news/ufo_hacker_extradition_treaty_lopsided_says_mp_1_1426353 i will try and get hold of the books you mentioned . 
  top voted comment in telegraph : `` if you want to live in the eurozone , go live in mainland europe . 
  the uk is an island nation , culturally has very little to do with mainland europe and will never join the euro . 
  i do n't understand why these pro-eu , anti-british whingers do n't piss off and live in france or germany , surely they 'd much prefer it amongst their european brothers ? '', 
  i agree that it is speculation - my speculation . 
  its based on the strong and very strange type of hold the us has over the uk . 
  often forcing the uk to do things that go against its best interests . 
  things that a rational leader would not agree to do unless he had no choice . 
  or someone had something on him . 
  he says he thought it was the right thing to do . 
  and maybe he had to convince himself until he believed it . 
  i dont doubt that in the end he really believed it . 
  but i am willing to bet that he went into war because he was following orders from his masters across the ocean . 
  i dont know what hold the us has on our politicians but they all ** bend over ** to preserve that `` special friendship '' and be the usas bff . 
  once obama praised the special friendship that the us had with france and you can not believe the reaction of the uk and media . 
  it was hilarious and also so pathetic . 
  the one thing that unites british people is their hatred of blair . 
  he is not divisive in that respect - our dislike for this man brings us all together . 
  its not just r/ukpolitics . 
  he did not do what was best for the uk or the eu but did what the us wanted him to do like a good little poodle . 
  i have not forgiven him for the war and question his integrity . 
  you are right that he may have the skills but i want somebody who puts the eu first . 
  why did you not include jews ? 
  why pick only on muslims ? 
  both of them circumcise their male children . 
  i agree with your sentiment and would upvote your comment if you did not come across as such a racist . 
   if you want transparency in politics , lobby for it and cause a fuss . 
  palming the problem off to an international organisation with questionable democratic legitimacy and grave problems of its own is n't the solution . 
  well the solution is not the uk dealing with it because they have not and they wont . 
  the independent has done something about it by exposing it . 
  if nothing happens do you think one person lobbying will make a change . 
  i wish i was that idealistic and believe that if i got involved it would make a difference . 
  but the bottom line is that eu nations need to get involved in this matter as it affects them all . 
  they all have a responsibility to protect the eu . 
  i could turn it around and say that if you do not want the eu to interfere then lobby for the uk to change its policies . 
  bottom line - if you dont want the eu to get involved or to interfere then fix the problems in your own back yard - so you dont give them a reason to legislate further . 
   why not ? 
  dont know if you are that naive but do you really think they would vote against their self interest ? 
  they have not done so yet . 
  sometimes its not a good idea to let the foxes guard the chickens . 
   do the institutions of the eu have a better track record ? 
  i bet if the germans saw this happening in france , or italy or greece they would speak out against this practise and cry foul . 
  same with the french against the germans . 
  this system may work better . 
  let countries police each other when it comes to the good of the eu . 
  if an action affects the eu they have every right to intervene . 
   do the institutions of the eu have a better track record ? 
  crsp do you really think that the uk will tackle this issue ? 
  and how ? 
  because they have let it go on for so long ,, 
  ... ... because they are influencing eu policy as well . 
  ideally it should be on national level . 
  in our ( uk ) case - they will not do anything on a national level . 
  the government is run by these people who will not vote against their interests . 
  they have not successfully policed themselves and wont . 
  this makes me so angry . 
  the rules do not apply to our leaders . 
  the eu should set guidelines for persons in political power to disclose all their interests or even better to not have any conflict of interest . 
  you can not serve two masters . 
  i wish i could say the same about cameron, 
  ** you say you are no longer religious ? 
  ** `` i have lost my faith . 
  they use god 's name to start wars . 
  when i came to europe and asked for a pacifist church , nobody understood what i was talking about . 
  ** there are no churches in germany or sweden that are pro war . '' **, 
  they also cant afford it . 
  do you know that the political party ( state ) will pay your transportation / ferry trip so that you can vote in the election . 
  if say you live in athens but are registered to vote in say on island of corfu , the pay for you to travel and vote . 
  is it racist to statistically breakdown the crimes and analyse them by nationality , sex , age ( assuming the figures have not been distorted ) ??
