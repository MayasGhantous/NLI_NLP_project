  and how they are involved in everything from politicians to business to the judicial system . 
  is that accurate ? 
  is it all of italy or certain parts of italy ? 
  it is very scary , and i do not know how you deal with that problem as a country . 
   since when did politics ever have anything to do with reason or logic i guess that is the problem, 
  this link has been provided by `` aceofspades25 '' regarding its success . 
  i dont think beating up a child is the best way to discipline it . 
  you only create a damaged individual . 
  i prefer to use reason , logic and setting boundries - that is how you end up with healthy productive people who contribute to society . 
  - paying ludicrous rates will not enable the country to sort out its problems . 
  - it will cost us in the eu a lot more to sort out this mess, 
  thank you . 
  i agree that it is better to do something - even if it is making your opinion known . 
  i do not want greece to default , i want them to be able to pay their debts . 
  however when their bond yileds are so absurdly high and have to pay such a high interest on their debt , they will default and my banks will also run into problems - and that is when i will end up bailing out my banks . 
  it will be less painfull for all if we helped these countries by lending them money at a reasonable rate , and not destroying their economy in the process . 
  it will be cheaper . 
  i will tell you what i know about them . 
  i heard about them today . 
  i was reading the financial times and they had an article on the eu and mentioned that stephen fry ( http://twitter.com/#!/stephenfry ) had supported this cause . 
  i am a fan of stephen fry , and i also wish to add my voice that the bailout terms should benefit the countries , and build them up to be able to repay their debts , rather then destroy them with unrealistic terms . 
  here is a link to members stories : http://www.avaaz.org/en/community.php#memberstories i do not know much about avaaz , but here is some details regarding what they do : http://www.avaaz.org/en/about.php there is some information on wikilpedia discussing their campains . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avaaz.org i am not sure how succesful they are , but the more people speak up , and the more people that get involved , the more power they can have to bring issues to the fore . 
  please sign this patition . 
  i believe the bailout , and the terms of the bailout should help the people of greece , spain , italy , portugal , ireland fix their country - and not to make bankers richer ( while bankrupting their economy ) unbelievable , they 're doing it again . 
  our governments are giving even more free taxpayer money to banks !, 
  absolutely , we need to bailout greece to save greece , and save europe . 
  but the current bailout makes us the taxpayers pay back banks for 90 % of their foolish investments . 
  greek people do n't get a cent , and we give a ton of money to rich bankers . 
  and even worse -- about 30 % of our money will go to speculators who will make a massive profit from gambling on a bailout !, 
  how on earth did our governments write a bailout plan that floods banks and speculators with our money and leaves greece with nothing ? 
  the answer -- they actually asked bankers to write the agreement . 
  our finance ministers are deciding on this plan in days -- let 's send them and our parliaments a massive call to go back to the drawing board , and bailout greece , not the banks . 
  i worked in greece as a contractor - and they are realistic . 
  even with a 13th cheque , they are still paid a lot less then other eu countries . 
  upvote for username, 
  not disputing what you said , but would like to know what the eu loose by letting turkey go its own way . 
  i think that turkey benefits much more than the eu , regarding preferential trading terms and any subsidies it recieves . 
  bring it on . 
  i thought this article was worthy of being posted here as well . 
  i am wondering what the mood is like in italy , and if we will see similar demonstrations as in greece , spain etc. 
  agreed . 
  world politics would be better . 
  murdoch has been one of the biggest opponents of the eu, 
  you are correct . 
  they are out to make money , and they use their `` incompetence '' when it suits them . 
  they get it wrong when they can profit from the situation . 
  if we as europe stand togethor on this issue , we can have the political clout to tell them to fuck off . 
  there is not reason why the us should be dictating what the eu citizens do . 
  just curious - are you also arguing that member states like eg texas and florida are not part of the usa ? 
  is that the basis of your argument ? 
  your so called facts did not prove anything . 
  apart from the fact that sarah palin has found her intellectual equal in you . 
  i really am curious if you can address those comments using facts , logic and analytical thought . 
  instead of that palin `` gotcha '' logic of yours . 
  or do you not have a comeback based on facts ? 
  or did mercurygirl `` get you '' , so you could only resort to a half assed reply . 
  well what ever we agree on , the eu has given greece more money , and imposed measures that will not help the economy grow . 
  thus greece will default and the eu taxpayers loose . 
  i am an eu taxpayer in the uk so i loose as well . 
  they have given greece money with out a plan to get it back . 
  regarding productivity , the country is not competitive but that does not people work less hard . 
  it means the resources are not efficiently utilised . 
  it means some people get paid a salary without even having a job due to the corruption . 
  and those that work , do the job of many . 
  i worked in greece for just over a year in international - consulting firms and found the people i worked with to be as competent and productive as people i work with in the uk , or holland . 
  my point was that for the same type of work i did in greece for # 14k i did in the uk for about # 35k with no change in my productivity . 
  the amount i am paid does not have much to do with how productive i am . 
  ** point 1 ** does it matter if you get 14 salary cheques a year or 12 . 
  what matters is the amount you get per year , or how much you earn per hour . 
  not how often you get paid . 
  someone in germany would probably get euro 20 000 per year , and somebody in greece would get paid euro 14 000 , but it will be paid over 14 months . 
  why are you resentful of that . 
  they do not earn more than you . 
  salaries in greece are very low . 
  there are a lot of people who work hard and get a small salary . 
  in greece salaries are extremely low . 
  when i worked there i earned less than euro 1000 per month . 
  i used to do corporate finance for one of the accounting firms . 
  in the uk i would be earning about # 4000 per month . 
  yes i got the 14 cheque , but it meant that i earned # 14000 per year . 
  i paid tax as it was automatically subtracted from my earnings . 
  ** point 2 ** regarding the age of retirement , i misunderstood your argument . 
  i assumed you were saying that you live longer if you work less or more . 
  ** point 3 ** i agree . 
  the greeks should have been protesting about all these issues long before now . 
  some of the changes will be beneficial although they may hurt certain special interest groups eg hairdressers , chemists etc. 
  a lot of greeks who leave greece are successful in their new countries but can not succeed in greece . 
  you success in greece depends on who you know or bribe . 
  there is a lot wrong with the country . 
  ** point 4 ** a lot of people in greece are angry because of the situation . 
  a lot of people were not responsible for this mess . 
  and now they have to pay the price - retrenchments , and a drop in salary that was not high to begin with . 
  they as a country are accountable for the crimes of a few , and are being punished . 
  yes , it can be argued that the greeks should have protested sooner , but i do not know why they did not . 
  they were complacent . 
  ** point 5 ** its not sympathy that is required , but rational thinking . 
  a lot of the measures are necessary and much needed . 
  but i do not think that the eu taxpayers should be throwing good money after bad . 
  i do not think these proposed measures by the imf will grow the economy or enable greece to ever repay its debt .
