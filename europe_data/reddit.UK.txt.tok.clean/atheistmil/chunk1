well , both italy and france recently found common ground with the ec , but they ar estill breaking the rules . 
  why shouldnt the uk seek `` common ground '' on issues it has a problem with ? 
  i had a dig for the electric market and there 's a few opinion pieces but i cant find the articles i had read previously - so much for google !, 
  anyways , the general thrust is that france is nervous about energy ( particularly solar/wind from spain ) from other countries reducing the economic viability of french nuclear power . 
  it is effectively protectionism ( again ! ) . 
  also , they have stopped take overs of their utilities . 
  a good example is the the french company that bought a uk power company . 
  the uk goverment ok 'd it yet were any other company in the world to attempt to buy a french power company that states `` golden shares '' would come in to play, 
  the budget deficit rules is the obvious example . 
  france has also been quite protectionist when it comes to danone ( a bit old but still ) . 
  it has also fought against the single market for energy and resisted foreign take overs of its power companies by using `` poison pills '', 
   i prefer the uk leaving to the uk deciding to violate eu rules and getting away with it . 
  but it 's ok for other member states , not least france to break the rules on a daily basis ? 
   it is one of the foundations stones of the single market it 's funny how little regard is given to the other `` foundations '' of the single market . 
  if you 're playing by the european rules , which given the forum i assume you are , then the revised classic opener would be king 's cross . 
  personally , i find that a bit obvious though and tend to play for a cross-lateral from oval [ . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mornington_crescent_%28game%29 ), 
  i think you overestimate the ability of militaries from different countries to work together . 
  take out the uk and france 's nukes and russia would wipe the floor with europe . 
   there are enough provisions in the treaties to integrate defence forces into one eu military . 
  outside of france and the uk i do n't think there is one eu country that could mount a serious response to russia . 
  even collectively without the uk the eu military is very weak . 
  the reason seems to be due the crapness of law enforcement and insurance . 
  my wife 's step mother ( russian ) was involved in a nasty car accident at the only proof was from a multitude of dash cams . 
   i fucked up a sheep if only you 'd stopped there ... 
  serious question - why cant these immigrants stay in france or anothe transit country ? 
  see my [ other post to you ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2k4uas/eu_makes_britain_pay_for_recovery_demand_for_an/clicoe9 ) . 
  france , and others have repeatedly not been constrained by the 3 % rule . 
  it was only those that were truly buggered like ireland and greece that had to comply . 
   france has been under the 3 % rule [ ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!, 
  ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=central_government_deficit_and_financing_of_gdp&amp;fdim_y=revenue_expense:3&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:fra:gbr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;ind=false ) france has barely met the maastricht criteria even during the height of the boom . 
  france has evaded rules over competition [ e.g. 
  danone ] ( http://qz.com/80043/yahoo-dailymotion-deal-scuttled-by-french-government/ ) old but interesting read [ civitas ] ( http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/civitasreviewaugust06.pdf ) ** pdf ** edit : typo, 
  are you kidding ? 
  the uk budget deficit has been around 4 % , iirc it was 10 % at one point, 
   people scream enough they get to skirt rules ? 
  see france . 
  the evade so many of the eu `` rules '' and treaty criteria it should be embarassing , but it is n't for them . 
  then other countries gold plate eu laws and get shafted for playing by the rules . 
   this is like london saying they do n't want any more people because they ` re full , and then the whole uk has to change the internal migration laws because of it . 
  it beyond reasonable . 
  the housing market achieves that . 
  how 's that maastricht budget rules working for you ? 
  this is where i hate the absolute hypocrisy of the eu . 
  france wants to ( again ) bend the rules for its budget deficit . 
  but < diety  forbid that the uk leader wants to bend the rules on immigration . 
  you know what is worse than the media ? 
  it 's the eurocrats . 
  seriously , i find it hard to believe that an organisation as poorly managed , so much of a `` old school ties '' brigade as the european union - run for the elites by the `` elites '' - manages to gain so much popular support . 
  again , this very week we see france breaking the rules on budget deficit without so much as a grunt . 
  until the eu starts acting and behaving sensible about its future in an open and honest way then there will be plenty of targets for the anti-eu people to aim for . 
  if the eu is such a popular thing why not be honest with the electorate and campaign on a european scale for its future ? 
  maybe the majority of people do want more integration ? 
  maybe the majority are happy with the status quo . 
  until we start finding out then blaming the british for being more squeamish than most is not only disingenuous ( even germany has an anti-euro party ) but it targets one nation for nothing . 
  the spelling on that map is awful . 
  proof ? 
  i 'm open to debate on most things but if you 're insane enough to try and claim the british train system is the `` best '' in europe you 're either comparing it to a very small , rural town in the far east of belarus or you 're using a definition `` best '' that is unheard of . 
  edit : read the article : `` british passengers rated their experience of travelling by train higher than people in france , germany and italy . '', 
  i think these are the same people that travel by car , as in `` 10/10 avoided traveling by train again . 
  or , simply that the french are complaining the wine is served at the wrong temperature and german trains run out of beer . 
  whereas you 're a font of knowledge and wisdom of doing business ? 
  which highly successful organisation do you run ? 
  you already have too many ships around cyprus * shakes fist *, 
  it 's so easy to get carried away with these things . 
  nah , it 's well known that we 're america 's poodle . 
   we joined the euro , not the dem . 
  hahaha , cute . 
  do you really believe that ? 
  all that is well and good but france , in monetary terms , is no longer a soverign nation . 
  no-one in the eurozone is a soverign nation . 
  that 's the point . 
  the ecb has gone through great contortions to try and bail out the countries without , in the strictest legalese , break any of its founding rules . 
  do n't bail out countries . 
  the political and economic framework for handling this kind of problem really doesnt exist in the eu , it needs to but the eu has spent decades pussy footing around . 
  it 's yet more evidence of bbc bias and scaremongering . 
  that 's why you have an enema before engaging in such activities, 
  play piggy in the middle, 
  only we 're moving further away from a 2-party system . 
  lib dems , greens and ukip are getting votes and have won seats . 
  ukip may well take a few at the next election . 
  and that 's not to mention the snp and plaid cymry, 
   i ca n't see increased military spending being a popular option in many european states . 
  that 's alright !, 
  when we 're dead , living under a new soviet empire/caliphate at least our unemployment problems will have gone away . 
  the eu really needs to be able to stand up for itself . 
  take the us out of the equation and if russia was so minded i think they 'd probably get past berlin this time . 
  heaven is russian women :-), 
  heaven is russian women :-), 
  again , not likely . 
  the market has constrained supply due to planning regulations . 
  no imagine a world were supply was able to respond more quickly to demand and more stuff was built . 
  there would be less pressure as more and more people are not chasing the same volume of housing stock . 
  the housing market is screwed by regulations which are present under any form of government . 
  if you had a more capitalistic free market then london would look very different . 
  you 've missed out caernarfon and conwy castle !, 
  at least one of them should be on the list  also the natural history museum is pretty awesome, 
  oh the train station - thanks for reminding me , 3 sets of body scanners . 
  there is so much to like about russia but the bureacracy is not one of them . 
  ah yes , i wa sin russia last week getting a train from kaluga to moscow , it decided to piss down with rain and the official on the train insisted on seeing my passport before allowing me on the train .
