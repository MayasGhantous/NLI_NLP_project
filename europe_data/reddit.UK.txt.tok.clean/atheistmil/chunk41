   hundreds of billions in unpayed taxes data ? 
  the billions in unpaid taxes are morally no different from the leech claiming eur400 a month . 
  a `` 300,000 billion derivative market '' is neither here nor there so long as the state does n't need to get involved . 
  i 'm not sure what the relevance of this one is . 
   you 're the imbeciles who will eventually turn r/europe into just another circlejerk-subreddit . 
  too late , 
  and if 100,000 people do that ? 
   do you trust other europeans to behave decently with your taxes , no . 
   as you would a citizen of your own country ? 
  i do n't even trust these guys !, 
   so what is the take away from this ? 
  that the club med lot should have spent the last 10 years reforming and improving their economies rather than pissing in the wind . 
  so other countries * do * have eurosceptics . 
  i know these guys dont have a snowball in hells chance of achieving anything but i admire their courage :d, 
  some people take a similar approach on other things like cliamte change :d face reality and embrace it . 
  humanity is crap . 
  i have a lot of sympthay for merkel as she 's trapped between her instinct to do the idealistic right thing ( no eurobonds before reform ) and the car-crash in slow motion which is the club med lot . 
  she 's damned either way, 
  i think that applies to most , if not all banking systems . 
   my penis works the same say circumcised as it does uncut . 
  no , it does not . 
  the functions work but it works differently . 
   i 'm not seeing the harm in circumcision you are wilfully mutilating a body part of someone who is not able to give their consent . 
  i managed to injure myself during what can only be described vigorous sex , basically my foreskin tore and didnt heal properly and basically no longer retracted . 
  this caused no small amount of discomfort and the doctors said the only practical option was circumcision . 
  yes , you would never know what you missed but that 's no excuse . 
  furthermore , i do agree that it is a form of child abuse . 
  yes . 
  as a male who had the misfortune to be circumcised later on in life due to a medical necessity i can whole heartedly assure you that sex is better with a foreskin intact . 
  edit : typo . 
  if we fine them a bit more then we can pay for the greek bailout . 
   or perhaps we 're just committing thought crime by disagreeing welcome to the eu . 
  edit : i hope downvoters will note the irony in downvoting , 
  you 're neglecting the fact that some jobs can and often will be out-sourced to cheaper locations where wages are lower . 
  this is unlikely to happen in the short term but would be evident in the long term by an increase in long-term unemployment - you should see this over an economic cycle or two . 
  furthermore , most companies will simply pass on the increased costs to the consumer via price rises so the eventual effect will be to raise inflation and thus the purchasing power of the minimum wage will in time reduce back to the same level . 
  italy , greece and ireland ( through their bailout of the banks ) , also the spanish government has formally requested help for its banks . 
  so no , fuck you deary . 
  because the eu has such a marvellous and rich history of obeying and implementing its own laws . 
   merkel want to keep us alive so we can pay our debts , not because any friendship or solidarity where was the friendship when the pigs were running up those debts ? 
  have a good time on someone else ticket and then ask them for more ? 
   i mean , even if they wanted to exit the eu , they would n't take the risk of proving the french right would they ? 
  you 've just converted me to a europhile . 
  again , i dont know . 
  but given the uk is pretty good at implementing eu law and abiding by it i 'd think we stood a chance , 
   yes , we need to fix the problems in the framework and strengthen institutions . 
  if we do this without a political union [ ... ] that is highly disingenuous or are you suggesting that all treaties we currently have ( including maastricht ) are basically unenforceable ? 
   it 's not possible to break up the euro in a way that would be even remotely orderly . 
  with the aid of the imf/world bank and a massive devaluation of the nations that leave the euro it could work . 
  the fallout would mostly be political and deepen hostilities between those in and outside the various clubs . 
  if greece were to write off its debt it 'd be fine in 5-10 years . 
  that would ruin most of the banks that lent foolishly which of course would have a big knock on effect to germany ( and the uk ) but then that 's what should happen when banks lend foolishly . 
  instead we 're trying to have our cake and eat it , something which is generating much resentment amongst people who cant understand why the banks are constantly getting `` bailed out '' , it 's not the banks that have the problem it 's the governments whose bonds they are buying with cheap ecb money . 
  the democratic deficit in the eu is one of the minor criticisms of the eu right now . 
  we may well be , i do n't know . 
  there is much to be said for encouraging free trade , moreso if we are able to use our strength in services to help develop other nations . 
  though i think an eu of the `` north '' could work well . 
  i doubt the uk would ever leave the eu at least in its current guise . 
  i guess it depends what happens with greece . 
  a quick dash to federalism will see the uk and probably one or two other countries ( czechs ? ), 
  take a step back . 
  i think the uk should try and set-up a rival eu that was grounded in sense and its members actually obeyed the laws rather than paying lipservice to them . 
   a `` commitment '' to form `` a committee '' to `` draft a process '' does n't mean all that much that 's one way of kicking something in to the long grass . 
   but if we do n't manage even that , how can there be any trust that the causes , i.e. , the lack of a common fiscal policy and the political union to legitimize it , will be addressed i see you 're setting the bar low . 
  greece has had the better part of 15 years to liberalise its economy ( so has france for that matter ) and perform all thechanges it needed while backed with european funds as a softener . 
  what makes you think that adding more laws will change things ? 
  we 've already seen how the ecb is skirting its mandate on not bailing out countries by conveniently lending to banks who then by a miracle i 'm sure you 'd agree happen to go and buy government debt . 
  a banana republic would feel ashamed at the behaviour of the eu . 
  who are we to mock the russians and chinese on rights and responsibilities when we 're already flouting the existing laws created in the eu ? 
   sure , it will be difficult . 
  so , let 's not try at all then , shall we ? 
  each successive increase in the mandate of europe has led to fudge after fudge leading to the mess we are in now . 
  simply shovelling more shit on top of it in the vain hope it works is not exactly reassuring . 
  it would be a much more positive thing to fix the problems within the existing framework and strengthen existing institutions . 
   how is it fud if the alternative is `` massive political and economic fallout '' ? 
  because the eurocrats will throw their toys around and the inevitable lack fo leadership will create the self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  if handled well a break-up or at least a `` fix the problem rather than apply more plasters to a sinking ship '' could work . 
  eurocrats do n't want it to . 
   when asked if this would n't take too long , he said that `` this can happen very quickly '' is he talking in glacial terms ? 
  the eu does not exactly have a great track record of acting either quickly or decisively . 
  furthermore , while i 'm sure many of the elites are convinced of the need for `` yet more europe '' has much thought been given to how this will play out within each nation ? 
  as i 've said before the use of fud to basically push through federalism is distasteful in the extreme . 
  sadly , the alternative is a massive political and economic fallout which the majority of europe would not handle well . 
   what else are they gon na do ? 
  stop being corrupt , try and punish those who are . 
  liberalise protected industries and encourage competition . 
  i 'd sooner just put it to a popular mandate and see what people want . 
   when combined with [ this ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:uk:pt:es:fr:it:el:dk&amp;idim=country_group:non-eu&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=803775600000&amp;tend=1308697200000&amp;ind=false#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=edp_b9_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:non-eu&amp;idim=country:es:ee:pt:el:ie:lv:cy:it&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=803775600000&amp;tend=1308697200000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) data yes it does .

  they were running budgetary deficits despite it beign an economic boom and plenty of money from the eu . 
  spain has so many long standing problems that were swept under the rug when times were good ( e.g. 
  an unemployment rate that was rarely below 9.5 % ) and now things are bad things are getting much worse . 
  granted the government has/should have more room to manoeuvre , but it is hobbled by the [ cajas ] ( http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_10/b4169024624450.htm ) . 
   the euro is a systematic failure and the crisis is just as much the responsibility of reckless lenders as well as borrowers . 
  fair point . 
   perhaps we should focus on what can be saved with progressive measures that leaves morality out of it . 
  forced federalism then ? 
  there 's far too much moral hazard in the whole thing to let politicians do as they will over the crisis and given they have shown they are not very good at dealing with this stuff in any sensible way i 'm not sure why trusting them now is any better . 
  fair enough , but it is at least contrary to the circlejerk around here * shrug * not everyone will like everything , 
   do n't try to make hollande look like the `` evil guy who wants to spend all our money '' he is n't .
