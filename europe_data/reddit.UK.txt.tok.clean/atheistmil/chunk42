  i 'm not saying he 's our saviour , but he 's definitely not the dangerous man the economist is describing here . 
  only time will tell  i do n't know wether he will or wont be but i found the article interesting nonetheless . 
  you 're also being quite [ selective ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:uk:pt:es:fr:it:el:dk&amp;idim=country_group:non-eu&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=803775600000&amp;tend=1308697200000&amp;ind=false ) with your choice of data points . 
  here 's a few more . 
   in the run up to the crisis . 
  10 years was one hell of a long run up !, 
   it 's for some workers who 've have worked since they 're very young i think it is but so what ? 
  does the same apply to workers in germany ? 
   so far germany 's demands connected to earlier solutions have not really solved anything . 
  whereas the french and club med tactic of spending like fools has worked well over the past decade ? 
  fro mthe article you have provided :  `` the principle is no mutualisation of debt without mutualisation of responsibility , '' said andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy spokesman in the german bundestag for the christian democratic union and  eu leaders will be given a first report at their summit meeting at the end of the month on what might be included in a `` fiscal union '' . 
   in berlin , this would include more intrusive supervision of national budgets , with clear guidelines set for social spending , retirement ages and pension benefits , and such questions as public sector pay . 
  harmonisation of taxes is one popular proposal in germany , and a common european tax to lay the foundations of a european treasury is also under discussion . 
  france is , or rather hollande is kinda running counter to this with his desire to reduce the pension age for some workers . 
  it was sarcasm . 
  by issuing eurobonds or mutalising debt you 're basically asking germany to use it 's own credit rating to lower costs for others . 
  there have been calls to do with without any of the german demands/desire for a banking union . 
  this would meet the criteria as stated by the economist . 
  i 'm having slightly trouble finding one article which covers the whole lot with quotes from hollande himself , but it is widely reported . 
  what americans ? 
  the economist is a uk publication . 
  try again . 
   ** that view is only reinforced when mr hollande joins the leaders of spain and italy in pressing germany to be * unconditionally generous * with its credit **, 
   nervous markets see france as more like spain or greece than germany or austria . 
  that view is only reinforced when mr hollande joins the leaders of spain and italy in pressing germany to be unconditionally generous with its credit always easier to spend other peoples money is n't it ? 
  good little german . 
  and this is why you ssh to your home machine ( or other machine at your disposal ) and use irc via the command line from there . 
  no trace of irc on your machine , 
   popular linux client : ~ ~ xchat ~ ~ irssi :-), 
  i side with the government on this one , it is crazy that coal is being subsidised in spain . 
  that 's not far off 1 per year ... they do like change, 
  185th this decade ? 
   yeah , but i never said anything close to that , if you have a little look . 
  just that inequality is rising . 
  ok , maybe the fault is mine , it just sounded like hyperbole . 
   unfortunately that is something that is unlikely to ever change . 
  now who is saying `` it 's all bad fuck it all '' ? 
  we need to work very hard at removing corruption & ensuring the rule of law is obeyed in spirit . 
  the problem is that the hack breaks the spirit of the [ german constitution ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2011/09/german-court-upholds-eurozone-bail-outs ) and skirts the problems . 
  there is a lot of criticism for companies that break the spirit of the law when it comes to tax avoidance despite it being perfectly legal but you 're arguing that a similar principle is fine for policiticians to do . 
  that reeks of double standards . 
   things are bad , but they 've always been bad , so fuck it all ? 
  no , but to say there was some nirvana period where the average person was living the dream is false . 
  the `` average '' person is always hard up . 
   fact the dangerously unregulated market is more to blame . 
  have you seen the amount of legislation that banks have to adhere to in the eu ? 
  it 's far from `` dangerously unregulated '' . 
  it 'd more accurate to say it is poorly over-regulated . 
   but remember that banks lobby very strongly for such conditions , even though both the banks and the politicians were aware of the risks and this is why in a better capitalist system we would ensure that the banks would fail and that the shareholders and bondholders took the hit rather than the taxpayer . 
  along side existing assurance policies for depositors there is little reason for socialising the losses of banks like the eu did . 
   so to say that `` they really are n't '' to blame , is at least as inaccurate as my statement . 
  are you blaming them for the current mess in the eurozone ? 
  in which case the banks have little to be blamed for . 
  if you mean the earlier crisis in 2008 then yes there is some scope for assigning blame but in the context of what happened there are mroe important factors namely poor regulation , lousy ratings agencies and deluded economic policies by governments . 
   however , with our one vote every four years , there is not a lot we can do directly , short of revolution ? 
  what would you suggest ? 
  honestly , i think politicians should be legally accountable for their actions . 
  the concept of `` presidential '' immunity which appears to still exist in some countries should be scrapped and in cases of corruption / incompetence then politicians should be in court . 
  to look at the uk gordon brown and bliar raped the country and then walked away with fat pay cheques despite many of their decisions being demonstratably designed to further their own near-term needs . 
  i agree that it is increasing but it is increasing from a very low base in the image you 've provided . 
  also as a recent article on the bbc showed you can have decreasing relative poverty because average wages are falling . 
  that 's a bit of perverse logic is ever there was one . 
  edit : typos, 
   essentially the average guy is pretty hard up . 
  find me a period in time when they were n't . 
   they are largely responsible for getting us in this mess in the first place they really are n't . 
  they 're a very convenient scape goat for politicians though also they are incredibly easy targets . 
  like any complexs narative there is much more devil in the detail than the headline `` evil bankers '' . 
   there are treaties in place . 
  well let 's change the fucking treaties . 
  if there was the will to do it , it would be done . 
  eh , heard of this little thing called `` democracy '' ? 
  between the european conssitution and the treaty of lisbon there has been a dwindling support for further european integration even amongst the core countries like frace . 
  good luck on getting a popular mandate to effectively force through federalism . 
   but so many politicians are cosied up to lobbyists and senior bankers that they pretend their hands are tied . 
  true , but we - yes * we * the people have only ourselves to blame for disengaging in politics and not holding out politicians to account for their failings . 
  we let robber-barons run countries - chirac , berlesconi to name but two . 
  i can understand your anger but it is somewhat misplaced . 
  yes , they get to pocket the difference and make a good profit - assuming of course that the debts are repaid and not written off a la greece debt ( to some extent ) . 
   my international finance knowledge is n't great but does anyone know why the ecb has basically handed the banking industry $ 100bn + in free money ? 
  government bonds are typicallty considered safe assets and can be used to increase the amount of [ core capital ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tier_1_capital ) which determines a banks solvency . 
  furthermore , since the banks buy up government bonds it is a very nice loophole allowing the ecb to fund governments without breaking any of those pesky treaties which say the ecb can not lend directly to governments . 
  they show zulu every christmas too . 
  and lots of silly american films . 
  i think statistics are always massaged by politicians because they want to make themselves re-electably and they can only do this if they are seen to deliver on their promises . 
   a draft communique from the summit of g20 leaders in mexico said europe will take `` all necessary measures '' to hold the eurozone together and break the `` feedback loop '' between sovereign states and banks . 
  made me chuckle . 
  looks like the end game is in sight . 
  germany time to play your hand and see if you won :d, 
  by `` give-in '' you mean buy europe at a massively discounted price ? 
  i do n't , it 'd make scrabble eaiser . 
  each generation rebels against , or thinks they have it harder than the last . 
  this is neither new nor newsworthy . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:es:el:it:ie:uk&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=422146800000&amp;tend=1334790000000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false&amp;q=unemployment+rate+spain ) a link to a graphic showing unemployment in several eu states . 
  in this graphic you can see that the last 10-15 years has been relatively kind to people with the exceptions of spain and greece . 
  while this does not delve in to the details of youth unemployment it does show that the problem faced by each group is not as unique as it is assumed . 
  debt may be easier to get these days , but if well managed ( on a personal and national level ) it need not be a bad thing . 
  going back even to my parents day the number of people who went to university was a hell of a lot lower than it is today ( about 10 % i think , compared to nearly 40 % now ) . 
  the consequence is that someone has to pay for it , the state provides some support but if it is deisrable for more people to go then the recipients of the education can/should bear more of the cost . 
  now imagine if the governments were to say they were cutting the number of university places to 10 % and that the funding would be paid for .
