  moreso since part of this common goal seems to be to put one of the uks strongest industries at a competitive disadvantage in relation to its global peers . 
  if the eurozone want to save money cut the cap , there 's billions there !, 
   the fact than there even is an agreement on this scale is praiseworthy in the fight to beat back the euro crisis . 
  to be clear , right now if there was open conflict then markets would be punishing them and we could see things get a lot worse . 
  as drunkentypist says there are a * lot * of red lines for each country , but each no that they need to make the right noises so the economy does n't tank . 
  even as a eurosceptic i must apologise for whatsherface ashton , she is an embarassment . 
   europe , not the eurozone , is in this together . 
  er , hungary , sweden and the czechs look likely to not sign up . 
  dont count your chickens before they hatch . 
  hush now pigsy . 
  if you cant tell the difference you have bigger problems than i can explain away . 
  it 's a commonly used term and has been for a very long time , long before this crisis emerged . 
   uk says the more it is asked for , the more it will ask in return - and any treaty agreed by the uk would have to go through parliament . 
  and rightly so . 
  yay cameron . 
   that includes a proper central bank which would have enabled some form of qe . 
  wtf do you think the ecb is ?!, 
  the germans have always been adamant that the ecb should not be a lender of last resort . 
  i honestly ca n't see the uk swaying that years ago when all was fine and dandy . 
  even in a crisis they dont appear to want to let the ecb print money . 
   true , but that seems unlikely to be overly common unless it was something that would just benefit us and no one else or it was outright stupid . 
  think about this politically , a transaction tax on finance would be a major detriment to the uk because of the global nature of the banking industry . 
  this may affect frankfurt and paris in some way but it 'll be peanuts compared to the uk as are quite a bit smaller . 
   better than no voice at all , though , leaving us having to deal with decisions we have had no hand in making , as is the case now . 
  why is it so bad to be masters of our own destiny ? 
   i highly doubt much of significance would change were we within the eurozone . 
  i am lost for words ... a ** lot ** of would change . 
  for a start our interests rates would be 1 % ( or until very recently 1.5 % ) . 
  we would not have been able to use qe to help the banks out . 
  those are ** not ** trivial things . 
  i do n't wish to be dismissive you what you say but you clearly do not understand a lot of issues around fiscal policy . 
   more importantly , though , it would give us more of a voice in europe this may well be the case , but as i said before if it were the uk v the rest of the eurozone we would obviously be out-voted . 
   an anglo-fanco-german alliance at the centre of europe would be far more palatable to me than the current franco-german alliance . 
  it may be more palatable to you , but it is not a likely outcome . 
   a common currency is a fine idea with fucking huge caveats . 
   one that being outside of raises barriers to our trade with our biggest trading partners . 
  the free market and the ability to set our own fiscal policies in accordance to * our * needs outweighs the benefit of using the euro . 
  why for the love of god should we join a fiscal union with europe ? 
  hull is definitely not `` open minded forward thinking and a bit bohemian '' . 
   very right-wing economic policies . 
  uhm , no . 
  he was many things and i hate the guy but he is a far stretch from `` very right wing '', 
  [ relevant ] ( http://xkcd.com/386/ ), 
  of course germany benefited from it , but it is a stretch to say they got the most from it . 
   when the [ person who was the father of the euro says it was doomed from the beginning ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8932647/euro-doomed-from-start-says-jacques-delors.html ) then maybe you might want to rethink what you mean be `` eurosupport '' yes , there were fanatical politicians who wanted the benefits euro without any costs regardless of the effect in the future , yes there was a population across europe that was overpromised that the euro would herald a new era of prosperity . 
  fuck , you can find people that believe in gods and horoscopes . 
  does that mean they are correct ? 
  no , it does not . 
  there was no way in hell that the euro was ever going to succeed without a lot more fiscal oversight . 
  this was blindingly obvious for anyone who cared to look . 
  this is n't about being a europhile or eurosceptic it boils down to very basic economics and an understanding of human behaviour . 
  any and every currency union that tries to do what the euro did would fail . 
  also :  i do n't believe that the eu constitution or lisbon are good indicators . 
  why not ? 
  because they do n't fit your world view ? 
  try to be slightly more objective . 
   there was quite a bit of support for the euro because of the reliance on germany , the pigs could clearly benefit from not having to have their currencies devalued every time their governments fucked up . 
  without the strength of germany ( and france ) then for club med countries the euro would have offered little . 
   but people did n't consider how several different economies would be able to function together with no oversight on fiscal policy . 
  you 're living in fairy land . 
  people ** did ** consider it , history is littered with examples , if you are an economist and are n't aware of these things then you are criminally incompetent . 
  sadly , those who did point out that the euro was doomed were labelled `` eurosceptics '' and told to shut up . 
  uhm , are you being obtuse on purpose ? 
  the eu consitution and the farce around lisbon should be a good indicator that there is a popular opinion against integration . 
  the treaties that have been made have been done by political elites who have gone out of their way to create a political mess . 
  we have never had a genuine poll that shows support for the eu one way or another . 
  the sad thing is the majority dont even seem to realise it . 
  i have a lot of friends in russia who are surprisingly pro-putin , though by large many of the people i know steer clear of politics . 
  unrest is growing but it 's from a very small base . 
  corruption is still too much a part of every day life . 
  it 's a sad state for the country . 
  germany is in a position of strength and your society is not collapsing like that of greece 's , so i 'd say looking out things seem terrible but the storm has yet to reach home . 
  how many of anyone that votes has studied health , foreign policy , economics or any other subject that parties sell themselves on ? 
   the euro had substantial theoretical backing . 
  i 'd love to see sources on that . 
  every article by any economist of note at the time was ripping the euro to theoretical shreds but they were ignored . 
  and how good to you think europes infrastructure is in the east ? 
  or would that be sacrificed ? 
  we are also vulnerable to russian missile strikes . 
  taking mad out of the equation and we would have a very bloody land war even against just russia . 
  we are a long way from being that technically superior to the russians that we could defeat them easily . 
   china has no ability to project force at that distance if china were to ally with russia the tropps could move quite conveniently by train via russia . 
  they share a land border . 
  might not be the fastest method but it would work nicely . 
  i agree being heavily reliant on the us is not a winning long term move but the majority of people here bitch amount the us `` military complex '' well , newsflash - the eu will need something similar eventually . 
  also , if russia and china were to ally and attack europe and the us to stand it out ( unlikely but lets think it through ) then i seriously doubt the eu would be able to defend itself well . 
  they 're giving hints such as `` we think this move would be economic suicide and we will downgrade you if you do it '' . 
  truth hurts huh ? 
   why the hell do we need to do that ? 
  because we spend small change on defence , our militaries are piss poor in comparison to the us , our kit does not integrate well though the uk has made a point of buying kit that integrates well with american stuff . 
  we should do it ourselves , but good louck convincing people we need to spend more on the military when social programs are being cut . 
  * cough * stability and growth pact * cough *, 
   ireland , as a sovereign state reserves the right to set it 's own tax rate . 
  one for the history books , 
  why should the swiss only get the action ? 
  and the same could be said for european spending ... financial transfers happen and will continue to happen between richer and poorer regions of states . 
  if you wish to be in the eu then are you going to resent the eastern europeans while they play catchup and the amount of money that is sent east ? 
  should others fund the eu for their benefit when their money could be better spent on themselves ? 
   because we pay higher taxes and receive less investments/services from the central government . 
  should the germans and other nations use that as an excuse for the rest of europe ?
