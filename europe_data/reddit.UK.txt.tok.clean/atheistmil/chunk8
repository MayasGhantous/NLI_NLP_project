  so much happens behind closed doors and between heads of state with little oversight or control i ca n't in all seriousness consider the eu very democratic . 
  the eu should re-engage with voters and accept that sceptics are part of the conversation instead of pushing them to the fringes like ukip and geert wilders party . 
  there are two blocs , the centre-right and centre-left , neither are a true challenge to each other and are basically an echo chamber . 
  sure , the eu has done many things that are good but it 's storing up too many problems for the future . 
  we 've already seen a small north/south divide emerge . 
  now imagine what would have happened if germany could not have footed the bill , then what ? 
  the eu must find common answers without relying on a handful of nations to carry the rest . 
  to grow up for the eu , at least in my mind , means to have institutions which have demonstrated competence , resolved issues in a sensible manner . 
  to behave like the supra-national entity that it is rather than a kids play ground where powerplays are made on the basis of whichever leader happens to be blowing in a popular way . 
  i 'll take the concrete example of the euro since it is what this thread is mostly about . 
  when it was formed there was no explicit guarentee what the powers of the ecb would be in case of a currency crisis . 
  the germans insisted on retaining influence to ensure that the ecb would not let inflation rise too highly . 
  indeed its mandate was to focus on price stability . 
  no mention of financial stability until 2010 . 
  it was incredibly clear from the outset that southern nations ' interest rates were falling to historic lows because of the implicit guarentee that germany would back the currency whatever happened despite this being explicitly forbidden by german constitutional ammendents . 
  the markets were partly right , but this kind of thing should have been clear from the outset and has helped exacerbate problems in the ez . 
  it was well known at the time that yielding monetary control to the ecb while not having any serious poltiical controls over spending would certainly lead to a problem . 
  always a `` when '' not an `` if '' . 
  nothing was done to repair the damage of france and germany failing to adhere to maastricht . 
  aside from the fact it was convenient for the south to turn a blind eye what levers of power were used to bring france and germany to heel ? 
  none . 
  and this is a sign of immaturity . 
  if the eu can not force member states to abide by the rules then already it has failed . 
  the euro was a disaster waiting to happen . 
  any rational debate that was tried by those who are eurosceptics was shouted down as the work of fringe lunatics . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're trying to show with the gdp graph other than eu & ez has only done mildly worse than usa and japan . 
   i would add perhaps that there has also been , in my opinion , some `` exploitative '' element , where the richer , more competitive north , or more precisely : companies from the north , took advantage of the situation in the south as you described it . 
  which makes the question of who is to blame for the mess slightly more complex . 
  i struggle with this one . 
  the germans ( not alone ) saw the potential for free riding but while times were good and they struggled they broke the rules ( maastricht criteria ) and as a consequence lost not only the moral high ground but the will to confront the countries with real and deep-seated problems ( greece , italy , spain ) . 
  everything the eu does is driven by ideals and political grand-standing with little though to pragmatism or good practice . 
  the northern countries are culpable in that they let the south get away with so much for so long , the south are guilty of misrepresentation and an oscar-winning performance of `` really ? 
  i ca n't believe such a thing could happen '' acting . 
  the sad state of the eu is that it has moved too far too fast without its institutions having any maturity of demonstratble competence , it is riddled with corruption and farcical elements such as the travelling cricus and italian meps being the highest paid since mep wages reflect local politicians norms . 
  the eu needs to grow up something it sadly shows no inclination to do . 
  why so many downvotes ?

  the guy should have been in prison a long , long time ago . 
  he has used his power and influence quite openly to alter the law in his favour and thus keep himself out of trouble as a pm . 
  i 'm not sure about the details of which pm you 're talking about in ukraine but the difference is likely to be one of actual persecution and manipulation rather than simply perceived . 
  yeah , it 'll be hell for him to be stuck in a massive mansion . 
  i wonder how he will cope with all those bunga parties ? 
  officially 35 hours pe rweek but i often put in about 40 , sometimes more . 
  i get 30 days holiday ( + 8 for standard bank holidays ) . 
  before taxes i get # 1250 per week and the benefits are amazing : healthcare , pension , phone , flexi-time hours , ability to work from home , highly subsidised travel . 
  though i could get a higher basic salary elsewhere the benefits more than make up for it . 
  sick pay for upto 6 months as a % of pay also . 
  paternity and maternity leave is pretty good too ( 1 month and 9 months respectively ),

  what do you do if you do n't mind my asking ? 
  # 70k or more is n't a good wage for you ? 
  or # 50k in the north ? 
  wages are pretty decent for what the job entails . 
  a lot easier than being a barrister . 
  edit : so many typos, 
  you do n't learn by waiting for someone to teach you . 
  simply [ read ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/encryption ) what is available and ask more questions . 
  i wouldnt say there is a boom in it , the market is improving but it 's far from what it was . 
  however , there is a massive shortage of decent people in software development . 
  if companies could hire more it workers i think we 'd see a lot more jobs , but they struggle to fill vacancies as it is . 
  most people are too lazy and stupid . 
  * cough * maginot line * cough *, 
  nah , we always made fun of the french . 
  even before the cheese-eating surrender monkey days . 
  it was usually cheap jibes about how quick the french will surrender to a passing german . 
  you could theoretically do that with some clever nfc tags . 
  when i was temping i was quite happy to work 60 hours a week , for starters it meant i had less opportunity to spend money :d, 
  [ hehe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raid_on_the_medway#1941_.22replay.22 ), 
  quite the contrary i remember studying ww1 in school ( quite a while ago now ) and one of the things that got talked about was that many of the tommies ( soldiers ) in the trenches felt that we had a better relationship with germany than with france . 
  the french were looked down on a lot as thieves . 
  in the context of the times it was shit on or be shat on . 
  perhaps to take pride is too strong a word , but it should necessarily be seen as something to be so shameful about as some apologists would have it - that said there were a few things which were truly shameful , but not everything .

  *** uk *** for mps i.e. 
  to stand for the national government see [ here ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/members/electing-mps/candidates/ ) where there are also some links to things that can disqualify you from standing . 
  people wishing to stand as an mp must be over 18 years of age , be a british citizen or citizen of a commonwealth country or the republic of ireland . 
  candidates must be nominated by ten parliamentary electors of the constituency they wish to stand in . 
  authorisation is required to stand for a specific party , otherwise candidates will be described as independent or have no description . 
  in order to encourage only serious candidates to stand , a # 500 deposit is required when submitting the nomination papers - returned if the candidate receives over five per cent of the total votes cast . 
  certain people are disqualified from standing as an mp - please check the electoral commission website for further details . 
  edit : there 's also this [ handy pdf ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0cewqfjad&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.electoralcommission.org.uk%2f__data%2fassets%2felectoral_commission_pdf_file%2f0003%2f108597%2fcan-you-stand-for-election.pdf&amp;ei=akt2udbaau-s0qxnzogobq&amp;usg=afqjcnhhnvpzvifgur4q1hhgwrv9rehvmg&amp;sig2=teqdjg3njjms6q7hwrehqq&amp;bvm=bv.49784469,d.d2k ), 
  i read this years ago and was recently reminded of it . 
  it 's quite funny and worth a shot for any who like a comedy/detective story . 
  options 2 or 3 are ones i 'd happily go for . 
  option 1 would be a very bad idea and i doubt anyone would think that is a good idea . 
  safety ? 
  security ? 
   twits per day that should be a measurement of government activity . 
  lots of russian sites are a rip off of others, 
  this . 
  getting vc funding to us levels in the eu is nigh impossible, 
  they only join in after an austrian has started . 
  i 'll see myself out . 
  getting rid of the monarchy will suddenly make everything better and turn sleazy , shitty politicians in to ones that are competent and good ? 
  if only . 
  there are quite literally hundreds of ways we could improve our democracy without touching the monarchy , and many of those would require a tenth of the effort . 
  at some point it should be up for debate , but as far as national issues go i rank this along side such pressing things like sould we sell 2litres of milk instead of 2.23 ( whatever it is ) which magically equates to 4 pints, 
  maybe i should rephrase - i am more than happy with the constitutional monarchy we have and there 's far more important things for * any * [ british ] government to be dealing with before worrying about the royals . 
  * sigh * time to dust off my cavalier outfit then is it ? 
  we vote for enough pointless idiots as it is , i 'm more than happy with the monarch ,
