`` wheres the popular front , then ? 
   `` he 's over there . . '', 
  not so . 
  belfast docks are still a target . 
  < whine  but it was * agreeeeed * < / whine , 
  apparently in 2007 , if some of the `` euro flags '' are to be beleived . 
  and they honestly do n't see the problem with that . . 
  not really . 
  i do n't think we feel much solidarity with people who joined a currency union against our advice . 
  that was very funny , and quite ballsy . 
  except at the time the * scoti * did n't live there , they lived in ireland . 
  the caledonii lived north of the wall , and they were defeated by the romans at the battle of [ mons graupius ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_mons_graupius ) . 
  however , war elsewhere in the empire meant that the romans could n't afford to garrison the land they 'd just conquered , and so the victory was mostly forgotten . 
  hmmm . 
  sounds lovely and ... bubbly . 
   former olympic gymnastics champion is it wrong that this turns me on , a little bit ? 
  everything but foreign policy and defence . 
   are you comparing having the option of leave or stay to being held a gun on ? 
  do you really think that 's a good example ? 
  it 's a good example of coersion , not a direct analogy . 
  what you described was coercion at a national level . 
   maybe its not the only reason , but it surely seems like that , but please , enlighten me no thanks . 
  i 'm not typing out all that stuff again on my phone to enlighten one person . 
  how about going and finding out for yourself ? 
  its talked about often enough in / r/europe so it should n't be hard to find one of those threads . 
  or visit the eurosceptic subreddit , or read `` the rotten heart of europe '' , written by a former uk member of the eu commission . 
  none of them talks about us collectively being `` special '' . 
   yeah , i meant leave . 
  and in my opinion , when you have to options to freely choose , you are not being force . 
  really . 
  so you do n't believe in coercion then ? 
  so if someone held a gun on you and said `` give me your wallet , or i shoot you in the face '' , you would n't feel like you were being made to choose between two things you did n't want ? 
   and a lot of uk people feel they are special or better , why else would you wan na leave ? 
  this is an ignorant thing to suggest . 
  people want to leave for many different reasons - how about you make an effort to go and find out why , rather than just assuming the worst of 60 million people ? 
   they would n't be forced out , they will be have the choice of being more integrated or live . 
  i assume you mean `` leave '' . 
  that * is * forcing the uk out - you 're effectively saying `` do as we say or we make you leave '' . 
  there is * no * widespread support in the uk for us to move towards further integration . 
  such a step would be undemocratic . 
   this is something i was wanting to say to the uk for a long time : uk , you are not a special country . 
  it 's sad you do n't realise how silly this statement is . 
  the uk has no more special treatment than france or germany , or another number of nations does . 
  and before you harp on about the rebate - we offered to give it up , repeatedly , in exchange for cap reform , but the french have always blocked that , because the cap benefits them disproportionately . 
   it seems like all of this could only happen with the consensus of the member-states regardless , that 's why it would be ` ceremonial ' ceremonial was a poor word to pick , imo . 
  the military , the law , trade , diplomacy , that * is * the state , and has been since before rome . 
  if you no longer vote on those things directly , then you no longer live in a democracy . 
   because it would come from the nation-states regardless , hence why i used the word ` intergovernmental ' , as opposed to supranational . 
  translation - you think people will still vote at a `` state '' level on ... well , whatever is left after you take out the military , the law , trade , diplomacy , and so on . 
  and that the `` states '' will then go on to do the actual business of running a country . 
  that would result in an oligarchy . 
   what he 's describing seems to be an intergovernmental structure with run by an organization with a ceremonial role . 
  managing defence policy , the military , diplomacy , law , and trade agreements is a `` ceremonial role '' ? 
  i would n't classify it as such . 
  and i would certainly like a right to vote on those things if such a state were to emege . 
   if that 's the case , best to just keep the legislative impetus at the nation-state level and they can put in common standards for human rights , defence policy , new members , and single market regulations through treaty change , if he 's really into minarchism . 
  this does n't really expand on your comment about why we would n't `` need '' democracy in such a state . 
  why would people not want , or need , to vote on the things you 've just talked about ? 
  wow . 
  your `` ideally '' sounds like a nightmare to me . 
  countries forced out of the eu because dissenting voices are n't tolerated , and fiscal decision making for european nations ultimately handed down by the bundesbank . 
  your `` realistically '' might be more accurate though , aside from the rose tinted glasses about germanys energy , and i think , an under-estimation of just how far right some eu constituent nations could shift virtually overnight . 
  please , tell me more about how we do n't need democracy combined with minimal government . 
  best freedom is surprise freedom !, 
  that 's piece is actually called `` the imperial march '' , not `` the empire strikes back '' . 
   yes but just look at the napoleonic wars . 
  for 6 odd coalitions we just floated around offing encouragement . 
  it was n't until number 7 we actually did something . 
  that actually undermines your own argument . 
  what you * interpret * as `` floating around offering encouragement '' was active engagement in european affairs , which is the precise opposite of what you were talking about . 
  the fact that you only classify military action as involvement is a bias . 
   as long as the island is safe we do n't care . 
  there where no real attempts are territorial enlargement into europe after the hundred years war . 
  `` do n't care '' ? 
  what does that mean ? 
  why is your definition of active involvement with europe confined to military action , and conquest ? 
   not being on the mainland meant we only took part in euro affairs to weaken certain countries . 
  that is n't true for us any more than its true for europe 's other nations . 
   the major focus has been abroad for centuries . 
  europe is `` abroad '' . 
  i assume you mean outside of europe . 
  i think its a myth that historically we ignored europe . 
  i certainly do n't see much evidence of that in reading history books . 
  we 've been embroiled in europe 's intrigues and petty squabbles for our entire history . 
  what the fuck are you on about ? 
  you really are wired to the moon , mate . 
  `` europe is france and germany . 
  all the rest are trimmings '' - de gaulle i 'd rather not be trimmings , thanks . 
  no one does . 
  i think you misunderstood the point . 
  the point is , when you said : `` well for a start scotland is actually a viable country . '', 
  - * you * do n't get to decide who is a viable country and who is n't . 
  the people who live there do . 
  secondly , the rule does n't selectively apply to the uk , but also to an independent scotland . 
  if , for example , the northern isles or edinburgh wanted to break away and become small states , you do n't get to tell them that they are n't going to be viable countries . 
  that statement does n't relate to anything in my post . 
  who gets to decide what a `` viable country '' is ? 
  is luxembourg a viable country ? 
  how about iceland ? 
  there are counties in the uk larger than either .
