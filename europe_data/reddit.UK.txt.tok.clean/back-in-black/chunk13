  it 's fascinating to watch . 
  their reaction to this story is that its all the fault of `` the corporate media smear campaign '' . 
  i said this a few weeks ago - corbyn will be their big daddy figure until he loses in 2020 , and then they 'll simply foist their messiah complex onto someone else . 
  probably another labour party leader . 
  there is actually a series of books on exactly this subject . 
  the opener is [ stone spring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stone_spring ) , and is followed up by `` bronze summer '' ( set around ~ 1500 bc ) , and iron winter ( set around ~ 1400 ad ) . 
  both the latter books are effectively in alternative timelines . 
  the first is set in doggerland in about 6000 bc . 
  roughly the time doggerland was disappearing beneath the sea , but also around about the same time people were learning how to make bricks in the near east . 
  the two are put together and the proto-europeans in doggerland build a dyke to hold back the waves , followed rapidly by attempts to reclaim submerged land and extend the dyke . 
  eventually , by the time the books sequel is reached , the dyke is a huge wall holding back the north sea , stretching from the uk to denmark , although neither country exists in this timeline . 
  edit : actually around 6000 bc , or 8000 years ago . 
  early in the book , [ a mega-tsunami occurs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doggerland#disappearance ) . 
  deserves to be top comment , or a least above the `` no england , lol '' type-comments . 
  what has always astonished me about the europhile approach to the eu is their attitude to noticing that it is n't working - they decide what is needed is more eu . 
  not reform . 
  not a change of direction . 
  but charge even faster in the same direction and call anyone in your way a populist . 
  `` your stupid statement flooded the eu with refugees . 
  you take them all . '', 
  `` but zat iz not fair ! '', 
  `` not fair ? 
  ** who are the nihilists here ? 
  yeah , i honestly ca n't stand the national anthem . 
  but then again i 'm also a bit of a republican , and would rather get rid of the royals . 
  rule britannia is just outdated as a choice for an anthem , but land of hope and glory might be a decent choice . 
  edit : nope . 
  it had references to empire in it . 
  maybe time for a complete rewrite ? 
   out yonder waits the saxon foe 8-o fucking hell , dude , that 's a bit specific ... 
  i wonder what he teaches ? 
  english teacher would be ironic . 
  ** hon hon hon , hon-hon le hon **, 
  til / r/europe thinks the bbc does propaganda . 
  nobody expects the customs and visas ! '', 
  he has a little blue one with golden stars . 
  a lot of that aid came in the form of food handouts and medicine . 
  you can see how this is different from food hand outs and medicine , right ? 
  what other kinds of aid are you referring to ? 
  might be helpful , when you formulate an argument , to say * why * something `` ai n't going to do shit '' . 
  if you watched the lectures , then you understand that he 's come up with a coherent explanation for why desertification happened in the first place , why attempts to control and reverse it have failed , and how it can * actually * be reversed and why . 
  he 's even demonstrated it on ranches the size of small european countries . 
  so why do you think he 's wrong , exactly ? 
   the un predicts africa is set to quadruple , to 4 billion by the end of this century . 
  at the same time as experiencing the harshest effects of global warming . 
  can anyone , with a straight face , tell me there are n't any clear indications we will face a wave of millions or tens of millions willing to come to europe , to escape the effects of climate change , of overpopulation , of poverty and of the inevitable civil strifes resulting from the above ? 
  we * might * , but it is not inevitable . 
  if we invest in africa , they 'll be able to [ weather the storm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueaftsfh_x4 ) [ * ] . 
  the worst thing we can do is be simply react to floods of migrants as they arrive without trying to help make their homes a better place . 
  [ * ] tldw ; of the lecture - is that we can use livestock to de-desertify much of the planet that is currently uninhabitable and in doing so , feed people and halt climate change by sequestering carbon in new topsoil . 
  allan savory has basically proved it on a `` small '' scale repeatedly in africa and north america . 
  edit : his ted talk : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpthi7o66pi which is much shorter edit2 : or the pbs clip here ( 4 min ) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvxchasdihs, 
  someone should turn this into a song , with the last line of the chorus as `` the kingdom of saudi arabiaaaa ! '', 
  are n't you that prick in the other thread blaming the whole of the migrant crisis on the uk alone ? 
  edit : yes . 
  yes , you are . 
  your opinions = lawl, 
   your guy churchill had some nice thoughts on that , maybe you should check them out . 
  churchill is often misquoted , and this is one instance in which he frequently is . 
  when encouraging a european union he was referring to continental europe , and not the uk . 
  to old imperialist types `` europe '' meant `` all of those people over the water '' and certainly did not include the uk . 
   on another note do you think england would be stronger and more prosperous if scotland , wales and north ireland left the union ? 
  your ancestors knew unity was necessary why leave over some minuscule issues in the grand scheme of things that can be fixed . 
  that 's 3 assumptions all in one go with very little in the way of facts to back them up . 
  they may stay . 
  they may go . 
  they may do either whether or not we are inside the eu . 
  and fyi the reasons our ancestors wanted a union on these islands was for security against hostile powers from continental europe exploiting differences for their own gain . 
  that is much , much less of a concern these days . 
  not much . 
  did n't we get the cross of st george from georgia ? 
  stalin was from georgia . 
  the russian army gave you a beating a few years ago . 
  and lastly is n't georgia the likely location of colchis ( from the greek myths ) ? 
  i ca n't remember if you were part of the ottoman empire at any point . 
  were you ? 
   europe is far , far more integrated than the commonwealth . 
  you 're right . 
  it is , but that * does n't matter * . 
  europe is the artificial creation of a collection of bureaucrats who wanted to collectively protect themselves from a changing world by forming a power block . 
  there is no real shared identity . 
   europe has a single parliament , a council of ministers and commission ( that effectively parallel a national gov ` t ) , the ecj ( court ) , and a vast body of law . 
  the commonwealth does n't have any real parallel in that regard . 
  true . 
  all created by bureaucrats and staffed by failed career politicians . 
  and the anglosphere has no equivalent ... 
  but as i noted above , it does n't matter . 
  it 's fluff held together by treaty , its not built on any sense of shared identity . 
   there is no real unity beyond the loose association of the commonwealth and shared heritage and culture . 
  the whole eu debate in the uk is centered on political and legal issues , not cultural ones . 
  there does n't need to be any * legal * unity at all for there to be a sense of shared identity . 
  the artificial identity of `` european '' that has been created in the last couple of decades is convenient for many people , but even so , its telling that so few people have taken advantage of that in comparison to those taking advantage of the language we share with a whole host of nations . 
  hell , i was born on the continent and lived there for years , mostly as a child . 
  i 've travelled all over the place and continue to do so . 
  australia , nz , and even the us have always felt more like home than anywhere on the continent . 
  meh , that 's an entirely arbitrary decision on your part . 
  there is n't anything really behind it . 
  europe is not a nation , its just a collection of treaties . 
  you have basically sliced the cake the only way it supports your conclusions . 
  if you take the english speaking commonwealth nations together with the us - `` the anglosphere '' , there is an underlying cultural commonality that we do n't have with europe , and the number of brits in those nations vastly outnumbers those on continental europe .
