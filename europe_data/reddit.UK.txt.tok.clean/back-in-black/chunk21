  i read up on memristors years ago and immediately saw just how much of a game changer they were . 
  the only reason we have computers designed in the way that they are , with fast memory and slow storage , is because memory is volatile and storage is not . 
  if you have a component that can be used as fast non-volatile memory * and * storage then in one fell swoop you have something that has the potential to make computers both faster and more efficient . 
  imagine turning your pc off , and then when you turn it back on again having every program resume from where it was just before you turned it off . 
  imagine the energy savings when you no longer have to keep hard disks continually spinning in every single machine on the planet . 
  that is n't even taking into consideration the parallels between a single memristor and a single neuron . 
  anyway , i 'll stop my massive geek-out here . 
  repost from another subreddit . 
  this is pertinent to europe because the author suggests that russia will use syria to end eu sanctions against russia . 
  this is explained in the video . 
  meh , does n't really count if they 're invited and the army switches to their side . 
  no it 's not bad , healthy teeth are not necessarily straight or unstained . 
  the older generation do not seem to care much about teeth aesthetics as the younger folk . 
  are you saying ... that france is the geographical equivalent of the worlds largest and most painful looking toilet log ? 
  they 'd never do that ... they do n't want to lose all that sweet , sweet cash . 
  you do realise that when you compare tens of millions of people to a child having a tantrum that it does n't make them look bad , it actually makes you look bad , right ? 
  jonathan pie is a `` mock '' bbc reporter that does pretend off-broadcast rants about whatever he 's supposed to be reporting on . 
  i thought / r/europe might appreciate this one , as its about ... wait for it ... * brexit * . 
  this cracked me up : `` the eu is basically a collectively owned sock for corporations to have a wank into . . '', 
  how dare they have opinions you do n't agree with ? 
  they 're clearly all stupid . 
  `` you people '', 
  i honestly do n't think anyone would care . 
  in fact , a lot might be relieved they could pick one language to learn to be understood on the continent without people getting mad at them for using english . 
  dry humour my friend, 
  personally i like mine straight because they are easier to dunk in my tea . 
  and a deep fat fryer . 
  mmmmm ... 
  trevor moore from `` the whitest kids you know '' has done some really fucking funny stuff . 
  a favorite : [ founding fathers rap ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-medpljhem ), 
  [ `` mmm , check out the ass on him ... '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6txjrhphypa ) edit : sfw - it 's trevor moore 's `` pope rap '', 
  dude , we do n't control what goes on * in france * . 
  that is what the french government is for . 
  own up to your own problems . 
  egypt complete it first * sad trombone noise *, 
  i am * totally * ready to bend over for brussels now !, 
  hand me the lube !, 
  guys , wheres the lube ? 
  guys ? 
   it has as much influence as any country of it 's size ( or it would , if it knew how to properly use it ) . 
  `` oh , you totally have influence !, 
  '' , `` oh , okay maybe you do n't , but its totally your fault ! '', 
  admit it - you ca n't even tell when it is n't * your * wine ... 
  and we like our empires served with a dash of french tears . 
  how long before he 's a monarch ? 
  it means poland gets to be the gimp, 
  the newsthump headline is gold : http://newsthump.com/2016/10/18/man-who-demanded-sovereignty-of-parliament-outraged-by-sovereignty-of-parliament/, 
  you mean just like norway , iceland and switzerland had to ? 
  they did ' t have to do that at all . 
  no its not , but do n't interrupt a euroflag circle jerk just before they jizz all over each other . 
   on one day france says it wants all the finance companies to move to paris , and then a couple of days later does this . 
  you 'd think they would have learned from what happened to the finance industry in quebec when the nutty separatists got in and said they would `` ban english '' . 
  but apparently not . 
  that would be `` americunts '', 
  more like another hate mob . 
  look at this shit - i cant believe the mods consider this `` discussion '' . 
  for all the uk hate , ironically they would n't even be in the eu were it not for the uk . 
  `` it 's not hate if they literally are inferior to us '' / s, 
  you can debate for ages about whether the normans were french or not . 
  personally i think not . 
  if i were french i 'd also probably want to distance myself from the horrendous acts of genocide william committed in england . 
  when britain finally moved towards unification it was because of english aristocrats inviting a scottish king to take the english throne , not because of anything william the conquerer did . 
  and by that time the french speaking aristocracy was long gone . 
  as for the usa - there was no way for the uk to win that war without some kind of ongoing insurgency . 
  there would have been a compromise in the absence of the us winning . 
  they would , at worst , have ended up with a series of parliaments that acknowledged george iii as a token head of state . 
  aaaand it was posted by trolls_brigade . 
  again . 
   so no idea of when it will be triggered , how many times are we going to have to refute this nonsense ? 
  you 're even posting elsewhere in here claiming we might not trigger it at all . 
  both are untrue . 
  the pm has said it will be triggered next year , and has said that it will be triggered . 
  seems reasonable to me . 
  nothing else would be acceptable in a county that wants to call itself a democracy . 
   and no idea of what the uk will or even should aim for in negotiations . 
  they are literally figuring that out now . 
  the referendum was on whether we wanted to remain part of the eu or not . 
  it was never a referendum on whether we would remain part of the eu or adopt a specific approach * if * we were to exit . 
  i do n't get why you are finding this so hard to wrap your head around - a simple question was asked about status quo or not status quo , and we voted for * not * status quo ; ** of course ** its going to take time to figure out what that will be . 
  why would you expect otherwise ? 
   meanwhile the department for leaving the eu has only 32 civil servants and the diplomatic staff are far too few . 
  there was no such department several weeks ago , and i imagine they will grow steadily in size over the coming months . 
  did you really expect it to magically pop into existence the day after the vote , thousands of people in strength ? 
  if no , what size ** were ** you expecting , over what timescale , and why ? 
   finally there are the contradictory requirements that such a plan will have to fulfil , to placate the brexiters while not sinking the economy or research institutes . 
  so , normal politics then . 
  there will be compromises , and some people will get upset and throw their toys out of the pram . 
  just as in every other realm of politics . 
  honestly , you 're all over this thread trying to whip up some kind of panic party ; why ? 
  it seems kind of daft to me . 
  the two year figure was the last minute invention of an italian eurocrat , it was was never meant to be a realistic figure , and no one thought it would ever be used . 
  there 's no point moaning about the uk not triggering article 50 - clearly they cant trigger it until there 's about 2 years worth of work left . 
   you are going into all that `` too complex to prove '' nonsense on purpose and you know it `` mate '' . 
  i literally have no idea what you 're talking about here . 
  i honestly can not make this any simpler - either show the evidence you have for the extraordinary claim that the uk benefits from eu membership , but the eu does not ... or just be honest and admit that you just made it up and did n't think anyone would question what you said . 
   my question was a valid one aaand you know it and you know the answer to it - that `` contribution to eu budget '' is just a tip of the iceberg , your money sucking service economy will turn to shit if you leave . 
  if not then activate art 50 asap please . 
  as i said before , this is just a transparent method you 're using to avoid backing up your claims with any evidence , or admitting you just made something up . 
  either provide your evidence , or admit you just made up something that `` seemed right '' . 
   do n't think that all your bullshit and dislike of eu has n't been noticed .
