  after cnut died , the house of wessex took england back , just in time to watch the normans come and mess up the country . 
  bernard cornwell is writing a really great series of books on this era , i recommend them . 
  i think perfidious albion is in the same league as surrender monkey france and genocidal deutschland . 
  because we wanted to end the cap , the eu said `` no '' , so we accepted a rebate instead . 
  the uk has repeatedly offered to give up the rebate in return for cap reform . 
  the answer has always been `` no '' . 
  and the french are threatening to veto the budget if agricultural subsidies are so much as touched , but as usual , it 's only the brits who are seen as `` problematic '' . 
  they 'll just add a new civilisation - romania . 
  they get writing for free at the start of the game . 
  in the following story , let 's call you adam . 
  adam , you have a friend , his name is dave . 
  ** dave : ** hey , adam , me and some of the other guys are getting together and forming a club where we all share the same bank account . 
  you want to join ? 
  ** adam : ** no thanks dave . 
  and no offence , but that sounds like a terrible idea . 
  unless you all have rules about how much you can spend , but that does n't sound like much fun . 
  ** dave : ** whatever dude , your loss . 
  it 'll be sweet . 
  ** much later ** ** dave : ** adam , we need you to pony up some money for our club . 
  ** adam : ** dude , i 'm not even a * member * of your club . 
  why would i want to pay in ? 
  ** dave : ** dude , we expected you to join later . 
  anyways , it turns out steve was spending all of the money in the account . 
  ** adam : ** well , i told you so . 
  ** dave : ** do n't fucking lecture me !, 
  you 're our friend . 
  we expect you to pay up . 
  and eventually join our club . 
  and by the way , we 're all moving in together , we expect you to come with us . 
  soon . 
  ** adam : ** wtf . 
  i told you i wanted nothing to do with your stupid club . 
  and now you want me to join it , pay up , * and * move in with you ? 
  no way !, 
  ** dave : ** if you do n't pay up you ca n't hang out with us , or be our friend any more . 
  we 've all decided you should move in with us . 
  oh , and you need to give us 80 % of what you make on your weekend job , me and the other guys will come up with the other 20 % . 
  we 'll use it to buff up the account . 
  ** adam : ** you 're insane . 
  question : should adam be * collaborating * more ? 
   it 's unfortunate that the uk may leave the eu when unity is needed the most . 
  but the solutions to the euro crisis are exactly what 's forcing us out . 
  in the long run , the eu is * literally * expecting the uk to adopt a disastrous failure of a currency , and accept a tax which will ultimately hit our country the hardest , to pay for a disaster not of our making , which we warned from the beginning would be a disaster . 
  did you not read any of his post ? 
  he 's already answered your question . 
  the europe that we see now , is on a one way road to federalism . 
  we tried to stop that happening , and we failed . 
  and now you think it 's our duty to . . what exactly ? 
  help it become more federalist ? 
  totally change our minds to keep france and germany happy ? 
  fuck , no . 
  i read this twice , thinking that perhaps i 'd gotten the * second * part of the sentence wrong . . 
  indeed . 
  i ca n't wait to hear another bunch of europhiles rant about how collectively awful the uk is . 
   apart from your condescending , alienating remarks that 's just how comelli rolls , yo . . 
  to be fair , population wise , canada is very small . 
   . . independence would , amongst other things , enable us to remove wmd 's from scottish soil . 
  the uk 's nuclear arsenal is located 25 miles from george square in glasgow ( scotland 's largest population centre ) and seven of the uk 's disused nuclear subs are sitting rusting away in rosyth dockyards less than 12 miles away from the scottish parliament in edinburgh . 
  as usual , a bit of snp spin here - it 's a bit [ misleading ] ( http://www.mod.uk/defenceinternet/microsite/des/whatwedo/sdp/ ) . 
  seven of the uk 's twenty seven decommissioned nuclear subs are at [ rosyth ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosyth_dockyard ) and are actively maintained , not `` rusting away '' . 
  [ the fuel has already been removed ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-15801357 ) from the reactors , and the only radioactive parts that remain are localised to the subs reactor working parts . 
  the mod is in the process of organising disposal of the reactor before the subs are broken up and recycled . 
  campaigners in [ barrow-in-furness ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_dreadnought ) , in england , have been petitioning to have one of the subs moved down to become a museum piece when this work is complete . 
   that would be morally reprehensible at the best of times , but when westminster is currently enforcing cuts ( with more to come ) affecting the most vulnerable in society this is an abomination . 
  nuclear weapons are a funny thing . 
  an independent scotland would benefit from having a friendly , nuclear armed ruk to the south , without actually having to foot any of the bill for maintaining the weapons , whilst simultaneously getting to feel all morally superior and smug about not being a nuclear armed state . 
  it 's kind of like when iceland get held up as an example of a state without a military , when in fact they have a treaty with the united states that guarantees american military protection . 
  nukes are n't nice , but it 's still better to have them and not need them than need them and not have them . 
  same here . 
  it 's like finding out that that girl you always wanted to go out with is actually a bit of a bitch . 
   what is nonsense is these `` variable geometries '' marketing gimmick , because it would lead to more fragmentation . 
  sorry , the eu wo n't commit suicide because there are some nuts in tory circles , using their media contacts to magnify some eu mistakes while hiding the benefits from their electorate . 
  i 'm not an eu apologist but i do n't hide my head in the sand . 
  well `` variable geometies '' is just me quoting what was said above . 
  and as for fragmentation - what would you rather have , an eu with members who are leaving because of its single-mindedness and lack of flexibility , or an eu in which everyone stays and slowly comes to some kind of accord on what they collectively want the organisation to be . 
  you can only pick one . 
   the `` variable geometries '' is another polite way of saying `` we want to be in only if it 's in our interest '' . 
  uk knows that it is isolated because of this shit , and tries to make it seem like there is a large bloc behind it , supporting the same . 
  newsflash : there is n't . 
  a couple of disagreements from others do n't mean a thing , things like that will be ironed out . 
  eu always finds common ground . 
  as i noted above , an eu of more than one track would not just benefit the uk . 
   all eu members influence the eu . 
  educate yourself about the function of eu 's institutions . 
  it should be painfully obvious to everyone , by now , that all is not equal in europe . 
  some members have more say than other members . 
  at the very least it should be obvious that those states in financial trouble have far less say than the ones that are relatively financially healthy . 
  it should also be apparent that there is a strong case for some states to exit the euro , and that this option has been kept out of reach for many of them . 
  it should also be obvious that france and germany are the primary policy makers in the eu , and that everyone else comes a distant second . 
  other states are bullied and cajoled into accepting what these two players want . 
  the rules are not set up for the benefit of the majority , they are set up for the benefit of the most influential . 
  but nobody listens to us in europe - our `` rational voice '' would be unheard . 
  assuming that joining the euro would have changed things seems a bit of a reach to me . 
   listen here friend . 
  the coming world will not cater to small , individual nations . 
  your country will have to `` hit rock bottom '' then beg to rejoin the eu . 
  so i keep hearing , but i think this is classic fud . 
  time alone will tell which of us made the wisest choice . 
  are you kidding ? 
  it failed for the exact reasons everyone said it would fail .
