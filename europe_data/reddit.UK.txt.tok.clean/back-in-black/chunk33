  we 'll adapt , we 've always managed to before . 
  well , the problem is , we have no influence . 
  has the uk succeeded in reforming the cap ? 
  what about the common fisheries policy , which ruined our fish stocks ? 
  and now the new banking laws ? 
  how do you think we 'll do there ? 
   it 's germany and france 's baby now . 
  has been for a while . 
  it was from the beginning , that was the problem . 
  we were out for so long , that by the time we joined , the germans and the french had already arranged matters to their own benefit ( such as with the cap ) , and had decided on a direction the whole project would take . 
  nothing we could have said could have made any difference in any area , we were wrong to believe otherwise . 
   but you will never know that , and besides - why would we care what you want ? 
  because we 're members until * we * choose otherwise , with all the associated powers that grants . 
  that 's why you should care . 
   the only thing you do is obstruct and shout profanities from the sidelines anyway . 
  yeah , thats right , nasty british , obstructing the way toward a centralised , authoritarian , federalist state . 
  how dare we ? 
   that 's my problem with britains attitude . 
  they want all the good stuff , without accepting any of the ( really minor ) rules the eu demands effectively accepting governance by a foreign power is not a `` really minor rule that the eu demands '' . 
  it 's a condition imposed by one group of people on another group of people , affecting their lives , their livelihoods , and that of their children . 
  the eu is completely undemocratic . 
  moreover , it is a club of nations run in the interests of few of the larger core members who resist any attempt at fair reform ( such as the cap ) whilst simultaneously proposing legislation that would disproportionately damage other members . 
  it has deliberately maneuvered itself into a position where a federal state is all but inevitable , having expressly stated that this was never a goal in previous years . 
  it is duplicitous , untrustworthy , manipulative , authoritarian , and a far cry from the simple common market that the uk opted to join decades ago . 
  * that * is why we have a problem with it . 
  i had great hopes for it , and was pro-eu for a long time , but its become a runaway train , run for the interests of a few at the expense of many . 
  unless there is much change , and soon , i think it 's time to get off . 
  no one has left the eu before . 
  upon leaving the uk would want to negotiate its exit with the remaining members , and part of that negotiation would likely be the uk wishing to remain within the eea . 
  of course , judging by the comments in here , the barrel of sour grapes that would be opened if we left would probably mean the eu would throw every petty slight it could think of in the direction of the uk . 
  not until we know for sure whether you 're going to fuck us over or not . 
  isolation ? 
  you mean like switzerland , or norway ? 
  they seem to be doing okay . 
   there is no if about it . 
  leaving the eu means leaving the single market . 
  if the eu kicks the uk out of the eea if it leaves the eu , then that will be a petty , vengeful measure , and everyone will recognise it for what it is . 
   that will hurt your economy , especially in the financial sector , which is pretty much all britain really has anymore . 
  untrue , yet often repeated in the circlejerk that is / r/europe . 
  the financial sector accounts for about 14 % of the economy , at the highest estimate . 
  that 's enough to want to protect , but not so much that `` thats all there is '' . 
  yes . 
  look at what happened in greece and italy . 
  if the uk is so important , then why do europe 's players push it toward exit rather than compromise ? 
  that 's the uk perspective . 
  well , to a certain degree i am playing devils advocate here , but your points have a few flaws . .  43.6 % of our trade goes to the eu . 
  he seems to think that somehow this is due to a technicality where our goods are exported through rotterdam . 
  i somehow doubt it to be the case that the government and economists around the world have miscalculated on a mere technicality . 
  what was said was actually :  ** the treasury pink book ** , the ** oecd ** , the ** european commission ** : all now put the figure at below 50 per cent . 
  the latest official figures , published by the ** office of national statistics ** on 11 september , show that the eu now accounts for 43.6 per cent of our exports , the lowest share since the current measure was introduced in 1988 . 
  in other words , they are not * his * figures , they are figures from other sources , including the eu commission . 
  on your second point :  his other argument is that western europe has n't maintained 38 % of world gdp . 
  that 's not quite what he said . 
  he pointed out that europe 's share of world gdp had drastically decreased , and is set to decrease further , down to 15 % by 2020 and declining , and that other non-developing countries have managed much better than that . 
  on your third point :  he goes on to say how switzerland has bilateral agreements , without even mentioning the guillotine clause or the fact that switzerland has no say when its signing up for all these agreements . 
  i thought it was a fair comparison . 
  switzerland is outside the uk and has a similar dependence upon the financial sector . 
  they 've done pretty well outside the eu , and have no intention of joining anytime soon . 
  no one seems to vilify them for being eurosceptics . 
  and finally :  and finally he moves the argument in the direction of commonwealth , which i imagine is just a coverup for the fact that a lot of conservatives , probably including himself want the british empire back . 
  i do n't think that 's really an accurate observation . 
  there is nothing wrong with wanting a closer relationship with nations with which we share a great deal of culture , and even extended family , that does n't make you some kind of bonkers imperialist . 
   untrue , it would have to happen in their jurisdiction . 
  in which case ... we should extradite them . 
  a better example , holocaust denial is illegal in germany , should someone do that in germany and then flee here , we should extradite them back . 
  i was actually referring to `` crimes '' committed on foreign soil , which are not crimes committed on uk soil . 
  and no , i do not think someone should be extradited for such a crime . 
   i disagree . 
  if the treaty were grossly unfair to the uk for example , including phrasing that permitted extradition without evidence for example . 
  i would count that as the country being burned by it . 
  no matter how reasonable a treaty is , i would not expect it to result in no unfair trial or things like that , simply because those happen in all countries . 
  that 's why i must make the distinction . 
  disagree totally . 
  the consequence of what you describe affects individuals within the uk , attempting to separate individual and state when it comes to these sort of treaties makes no sense . 
   but the cameron administration 's unwillingness to compromise leaves the german government with no choice . 
  how ironic . 
  that 's exactly how the much of the uk now views the eu - unwilling to compromise , thus leaving us with little choice . 
   the crime in question was spying , which is illegal here too , even if we define it differently . 
  but the definition of the crime is just as important as the crime in question . 
  if , for example , `` hate speech '' was defined in another european country to include , say , blasphemous statements , then under an extradition treaty the uk could find itself extraditing people for doing no more than exercising their freedom of speech in this country . 
  that 's clearly unacceptable , and yet , would be a consequence of signing up to such a treaty . 
   i actually asked how the uk had been burned , not uk citizens . 
  well , this is pedantry , really . 
  the uk itself ca n't be `` burned '' by an extradition treaty , only unjustly extradited individuals can . 
  well , you asked how uk nationals could be burned by an extradition treaty , and i gave you one example . 
  the fact that taking photos of military jets is illegal is daft and i do n't think the uk should be required to extradite people for that `` crime '' . 
  what about the british tourists arrested in greece for `` spying '' because they were taking photos of jets taking off from a nearby military base ? 
  good grief , baycitytroller - was getting told to sod off by / r/scotland and / r/ukpolitics not enough for you ? 
  you 're seriously trying to seek validation here , now ? 
  some [ history ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19904844 ) on this for everyone who is not subscribed to those other subreddits : baycitytroller is a scottish nationalist with an axe to grind . 
  now , there 's nothing wrong with being an snp voter , but when you start posting misleading headlines , and make stuff up to suit your own inner narrative , then it really gets up people 's noses . 
  hence , why his [ two ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/11aycx/desperation_in_the_unionist_camp_david_cameron/ ) [ threads ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/scotland/comments/11aywh/desperation_in_the_unionist_camp_david_cameron/ ) on this subject got downvoted to zero . 
  of course , he does n't interpret it this way . 
  he thinks it 's a [ conspiracy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/11d64h/is_anybody_aware_of_plans_in_countries_other_than/c6lf3c8 ) of `` britnats '' out to get him , rather than his own daft editorial decisions , that brought him the downvotes . 
  yeah . 
  we 've covered this in here before , so many times - 80 % of such a tax would be paid by the uk . 
  they might just as well rebrand it as an extra tax on the uk to pay for the euro crisis , because that 's what it would be . 
   interesting how whenever anti-uk thread pops up in r/europe , it 's always only the brits who defend it . 
  there 's never someone from some other country who would defend it . 
  and yes , there have been instances of people who are not from serbia defending serbia on / r/europe .
