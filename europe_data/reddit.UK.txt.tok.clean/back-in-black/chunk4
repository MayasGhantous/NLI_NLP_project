  loooooooong before the euro we had something called the exchange rate mechanism . 
  it was meant to reduce currency fluctuations in europe . 
  countries could only devalue so much . 
  we know . 
  the uk was in the erm . 
  [ it did n't turn out too well for us ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_exchange_rate_mechanism#pound_sterling.27s_forced_withdrawal_from_the_erm ) . 
  hence future scepticism about other bright ideas from the glorious visionaries in brussels . 
  [ citation needed ] out of the eu does not mean isolated . 
  most of the planet is `` out of the eu '' and always will be . 
  the other english speaking nations are `` out of the eu '' , and they seem to be doing fine . 
  if you shaved your balls , got halfway and cut yourself , would you then conclude that what you needed to do to fix it would be to shave the rest of your balls ? 
  * warning this post contains `` populism '' * i think its fine , as long as the nations joining such an entity get to vote on the proposition * directly * . 
   at this point in history britain has 3 real choices . 
  join the eu and be part of a world power . 
  become a protectorate of america and hold some world power . 
  stay alone and become an internationally irrelevant nation . 
  it 's all about how you frame the options . 
  he 's an alternative view of the options you presented :  join the eu and be part of a world power . 
  you mean become a compliant backwater within an undemocratic european superstate . 
  the eu have n't been very good at * asking * europeans what they want , they just keep pushing what they think everyone * should * want . 
  there is no reason for them to change this behaviour , as its worked out pretty well for them so far . 
  because of the way the eu has acted in the past , i see little reason to trust it . 
   become a protectorate of america and hold some world power . 
  you mean , continue to ally ourselves with the us , when and where it suits both us and them . 
   stay alone and become an internationally irrelevant nation . 
  you mean head into an unknown future as one nation amongst many of comparable size , into a world thats changing at breakneck speed , free to run our own affairs as we see fit , and free from an organisation conceived in the ashes of wwii , which itself could be irrelevant in a few decades . 
  and , honestly , as long as we 're free , who the hell cares if we 're `` irrelevant '' . 
  you very clearly have no clue at all . 
  true , but for some reason england has recipes for apple pie going all the way back to the 1300s . 
  we used to grow a lot more apples than we do now , hundreds of varieties , most of which are now extinct . 
  a shame , really , large agribusiness killed off centuries worth of work . 
  even our mythology has references to apples - `` avalon '' from arthurian myth means `` island of apples '' . 
  i do n't really like any of our monarchs , so i abstained from the ops question . . but one of my favourite historical figures is john churchill , duke of marlborough , who managed at the [ battle of blenheim ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_blenheim ) ( a very european battle btw - look at all the nationalities involved ) to destroy the myth of french invincibility , and change the course of european history . 
  to quote the link :  had it not been for blenheim , all europe might at this day suffer under the effect of french conquests resembling those of alexander in extent and those of the romans in durability . 
  his descendent , winston churchill , wrote a detailed biography of his ancestor ( marlborough , his life and times [ 1933 ] ) and because of his research , later became convinced of certain parallels between the ambitions of loius xiv , and that of a certain german leader of his own era . 
  he eventually began speaking in hawkish tones in parliament , insisting that a strategy of negotiation would no more work with chancellor hitler , than it would have worked with king louis . 
  and the rest is history . 
   because that `` compromise '' is the destruction of the union . 
  that is what you said . 
  a lot of what `` eurosceptics '' want is : * democratic accountability - which the eu terms `` populism '' * a move away from federalism do those two things and about half of the `` eurosceptics '' in the eu are happy . 
  that 's compromise , and none of it would destroy the eu . 
  so , for example : not having the end goal of a federation would result in the destruction of the eu ? 
  not having created the euro would result in the destruction of the eu ? 
  adhering to the results of national referendums would result in the destruction of the eu ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  does n't always work , though . 
  saw one of our nukes for sale down near brick lane market the other day next to some stolen bikes . 
  it was labelled `` vintage nuke ( 1970 's ) '' . 
  you began by saying that it is a 300 year old union . 
  so why do n't we stop for a moment and start by acknowledging that 's completely irrelevant bullshit ? 
  no need to get angry . 
  it is a 300 year old union . 
  but both nations shared the same same executive leadership from 1606 . 
  the identity of the army was forged by fighting common foes for hundreds of years , right from its inception . 
  i do n't see how that can possibly be irrelevant . 
   you 're really insistent on the common english language . 
  sure enough it simplifies matters . 
  but it 's in no way shape or form a deal breaker , much like it is n't for the rest of the european institutions . 
  we have europol , and esa , and even an european defense agency already . 
  it kind of is a deal breaker , you know . 
  an army is not like the other things you listed , you need a common language to fight together effectively . 
  even when using the same language - there have been [ instances ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_imjin_river ) when the british and americans have totally misunderstood each other , and it 's nearly led to disaster . 
  armies that share a single language fight together more effectively . 
  it really is that simple . 
  anything else is just second rate . 
   you claimed it was a 300 year old army with a common command structure , a common equipment set . 
  aside from the 300 years being irrelevant , you have a common structure and a common equipment set precisely because you have a common army . 
  no , i did n't . 
  the british army * currently * has those things . 
  europe 's armies collectively do not , and will not have a common army unless those things are addressed * first * . 
  imo there are too many vested interests for the eu to ever agree on enough of those points to form a useful fighting force . 
  300 years is relevant because what you see now is the product of 300 years of shared experience fighting common enemies , not 40 years of constant bickering with no coherent foreign policy . 
   makes no sense to say , well we have a british army because we have a common structure , but the eu does n't . 
  well of course it does n't have a common structure , we do n't have a common army . 
  as i said , chicken and egg . 
  i did n't say that . 
  and if you think i said that , i suggest you reread what i wrote . 
  here it is :  says the guy from a 300 year old union with it 's own army . 
  with a common language , command structure , a common equipment set , and a common ethos . 
  all forged during a time of civil wars , revolutions , and more revolutions . 
  that in no way states that we have a common army * because * of those things . 
  what it states is that having an army without those things is a lot more difficult . 
  i thought that was obvious , because it 's clearly true . 
  for europe - we do n't have a common language , we do n't have a common culture , we do n't have a common command structure , or ethos , or equipment set . 
  if your benchmark is the professionalism of the british ( or american ) army , you 're going to fall short by a long way if you just cobble together a half arsed bunch of soldiers with no common language , differing uniforms , equipment , supply arrangements , rank structures , rules , and ideas of what it means to be a soldier . 
  you honestly might as well not bother even trying , unless you 're actively trying to lose a war to someone and get your own people killed . 
   a 300 year old union with a 300 year old united army . 
  `` dude '' , yourself - both armies spoke a dialect of english at the time of the amalgamation . 
  and various combinations of scots/welsh/irish and english had been fighting on the same side , different sides , or has switched sides during the conflicts of the previous century . 
  soldiers in both armies had also , on and off , sworn allegiance to the same ruler for almost a hundred years before the amalgamation took place , in the form of the stuart dynasty . 
  it 's not like two foreign armies just decided to amalgamate one day . 
  if that 's what you think happened , then you 're mistaken . 
   and interestingly enough you see propaganda against scottish independence on the basis that their defence will suffer out of the union what `` propaganda '' is this ? 
  a quick search brought up some pretty valid questions , like [ these ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/01/how-would-an-independent-scotland-defend-itself ) . 
  other than the oil rig concerns , scotland would n't need much of a military . 
  i do n't see how this conflicts with policies on military cooperation with europe . 
   , all while telling mainland europe they do n't need a common defence . 
  i think you 've misunderstood again . 
  the uk backs nato , which * is * europe 's common defense . 
  the uk also regularly takes part in joint exercises with europes other military powers , such as france , and has taken part in operations along side them .
