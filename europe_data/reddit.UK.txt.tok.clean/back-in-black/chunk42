  that 's the meaning of the word . 
   the british media wreaks anti-eu sentiment and the british people give about 80 % against the euro . 
  wrong again . 
  britain and its press is largely pro-eu , especially when it comes to respected organisations like the bbc . 
  not wanting to adopt the euro does not make the uk `` anti-eu '' - this seems to be your core belief , echoed again and again throughout the posts here . 
  it 's a very silly belief . 
   you are a moron . 
  7 % are neo-nazis . 
  ukip are extreme abolitionists . 
  that person implied greece in whole are neo-nazis . 
  your neo-nazis got [ twice as many votes ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/ ) in greece as ukip did in the uk . 
  so , yeah , your 80 % figure is complete bullshit . 
   but if you want to ninja go there , brits are not extreme abolitionists but they do hate the eu . 
  so , you claim that the brits hate the eu , but that they do n't vote for the only anti-eu party available ? 
  that is a completely ridiculous belief . 
   e.g. 
  look at how many hate the idea of abolishing the pound . 
  not wanting to exchange the pound for the euro does n't mean they `` hate the eu '' . 
  that 's also a pretty stupid belief . 
   this strategy is pig disgusting cockroach british level , i did n't expect it from germany .

   7 % is all greeks now ? 
  the anti-eu sentiment on the other hand is apparently about 80 % in uk . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2012/may/06/greece-elections-results-map?newsfeed=true ) are the greek election results . 
  here are the [ recent local election results ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/vote2012/council/england.stm ) for the [ uk ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/may/04/local-elections-2012-localgovernment ) . 
  looks like ukip actually got fewer votes than the equivalent greek parties . 
  so , no where near your bullshit `` 80 % '' figure . 
   i keep hearing brits talking in a condescending manner to greeks to leave the euro and it pisses me off . 
  okay , so you 're not actually trying to start a discussion , you just want to vent about something you think you 've observed . 
  not a good start . 
   it pisses me off because they are not neutral at all : no one is `` neutral '' , the countries within the euro have a vested interest in it . 
  in fact , the uk has a vested interest in seeing the euro succeed . 
  collectively , most of us do n't want to join the euro for reasons that have frequently been discussed in / r/europe . 
   they fucking hate the euro , the eu and any kind of such union . 
  no we do n't . 
  we do n't `` hate '' the euro , we just did n't want to join it because we thought it was a bad idea . 
  the euro is currently struggling for the reasons that we said it would struggle , so we 've been vindicated in our decision not to join . 
  nor do we hate the eu , we collectively voted to join 30 years ago , and political parties that advocate * leaving * the eu get a [ much smaller part of the vote ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/ ) than , say , the neo-nazis did in your recent election . 
  so , calling us all `` anti-eu '' , is kind of like assuming all greeks are neo nazis . 
  in other words , it 's a stupid thing to say , and is based more on ignorance and prejudice than fact . 
   they are attached to their imperial past and they try to prove every chance they get that they are not because `` it 's ages ago '' . 
  this is absurd . 
  greece has parts in its history that are `` ages ago '' and still hunt them . 
  so , you think we are attached to our past as an empire , but you ca n't actually demonstrate this in any meaningful way . 
  sounds like another one of the prejudices you 're projecting . 
  you might as well throw the same accusations at the french , or the germans , both of whom had empires within the same time frame . 
  hang on , i forgot that a lot of the greek press have basically spent the last year calling the germans nazis . 
  maybe you pull this crap all the time . 
   i for one i 'm bored and sick and tired of the condescending manner you assume everyone should hate the eu and the way it `` treats '' its nations . 
  just because you were born in the 80s or the 70s or later it does n't mean your nation as a whole is `` free '' . 
  national traits such as a strong feeling towards another nation or nations or certain directions do not get erased just because a technical barrier was removed . 
  they are entrenched in a nation and they last for decades , to not say more . 
  and britain is not detached from the `` glorious '' days of the commonwealth/empire/etc . 
  you simply do not accept the least loss of sovereignty . 
  you are nationalist to the extreme in that regard and the sooner you realize it the better for most of us . 
  i really have no idea what you 're talking about here . 
  you are a stronger country . 
  stop assuming a small country with turkey next to it that on the first chance it got if it saw greece unprotected by international allies would jump into north-eastern greece and annex it to `` protect the minorities '' just as it did in cyprus , this is greek paranoia , and is frankly , one of the reasons you are in the financial mess that you 're in . 
  you 're spending too much of your gdp on arms , preparing for a conflict that will never happen . 
  it 's insane . 
   just as russia did in georgia , just as albania did in kosovo and so on ; stop assuming such a country is like you that you can fuck off from any international agreement and just stay with your american friends judging small countries with a high nose . 
  again , your english is failing you here . 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   sincerely , fuck off . 
  how about you take a chill pill , and give us a call when you 've stopped behaving like a toddler . 
   well , this is false i do n't see how its false . 
  right up until 2011 the only kind of rocket being used was the arianne . 
  now there is the italian modification of the arianne , and a russian soyuz being used . 
  the guy i talked to that was complaining about the arianne fixation worked in the uk aerospace industry . 
  so , that is straight from the horses mouth as far as i 'm concerned . 
  edit : did a little bit of digging . 
  apparently the arianne rocket is made exclusively by [ these guys ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soci%c3%a9t%c3%a9_europ%c3%a9enne_de_propulsion ) , in france . 
  so ... yeah . 
  french aerospace industry monopoly on manufacture . 
  seems to line up with what i was told . 
  well , my last two jobs had a few spaniards , and french , scattered around . 
  there seem to be more spanish being hired in london . 
  they generally seem a bit miffed about the situation back home . 
  like i said `` from memory '' . 
  i was having a conversation with someone in the industry years back , and those were the objections . 
  edit : interesting . 
  i just did some reading on this . 
  apparently the vega is just a [ modification of the arianne ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_space_agency#launch_vehicle_fleet ) for lighter payloads . 
  the soyuz is used because its a heavy launcher with a proven track record . 
  the ariane was the sole launch vehicle up until 2011 . 
   is it because british people hate everything `` european '' ? 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 no , it 's not because `` british people hate everything european '' . 
  from memory esa exclusively uses the arianne rocket , which was designed and manufactured in france . 
  the trouble with this was that the french will attempt to block anything innovative that is n't arianne , or does not directly play to the french aerospace industry . 
  esa was never going to fund a british designed and built space plane , and the only way this design will ever make it off the drawing board is if it is outside of the existing organisational structure of esa . 
   responsibility is not the issue . 
  nato is simply not designed to be 28 armies capable of doing everything independently , that would be a gross waste of resources . 
  this is true . 
  during the falklands conflict the royal navy had specialised in submarine , and anti-submarine warfare , which was a problem when it was attacked by argentine jets armed with exocets . 
  it cost the uk ships it should n't have lost . 
  on the other hand , the presence of extremely quiet nuclear submarines in the south atlantic kept the argentine navy in port for most of the war . 
  the admiralty learned their lesson . 
  the navy has a new set of ships capable of engaging and destroying dozens of aerial targets simultaneously . 
  the first one came on-line recently .
