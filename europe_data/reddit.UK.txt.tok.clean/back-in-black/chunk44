  i 've had the same conversation with americans dozens of times . 
  they * always * equate the separate states with the separate countries of europe , and often get upset when you point out that the us is pretty much homogeneous by comparison . 
  we need a language of governance . 
  the us has one , despite there being no official language . 
  india has one , despite having dozens of languages . 
  china has one , despite having dozens of dialects of mandarin , and separate languages like cantonese . 
  what will be our language of governance ? 
  because it 's horrible and no one speaks it . 
  it 's been around over a century , and has n't taken off . 
  seriously , i would rather we all spoke french or german than esperanto . 
  * con * federation . 
  in most of my political leanings i 'm fairly conservative , but this is one of the exceptions , as the voting system is in desperate need of change . 
  the political process in westminster is stale , and certainly lacks the vigour of what is happening in the devolved parliaments , especially scotland . 
  unfortunately , neither lab or con is likely to ever let go of their stranglehold , and the libs will never have the majority required to push it through . 
  the * only * alternative i see is to have a devolved english parliament , which follows the same rules as those in scotland , wales and northern ireland , which westminster and the other devolved parliaments are determined to prevent , it seems . 
  that would make pr the de-facto standard for the uk . 
  seems to have worked pretty well in [ scotland ] ( http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/proportional_representation.htm ) , wales and northern ireland . 
  why not just bring the rest of the uk in line with what already works in the devolved parliaments ? 
  why waste time experimenting with av ? 
  which has historically conflicted with the desire for * unity * . 
  the trouble is , no one really wanted that voting system . 
  we wanted pr . 
  new labour promised us pr 13 years ago , then realised they might lose their majority if they followed through , and so reneged on the promise . 
  the conservatives have never wanted it . 
  the liberal democrats want it , but were forced into a crappy compromise that they could n't sell to the electorate . 
  it surprises me that people still complain about this on reddit - as soon as it became clear that we were n't going to vote on pr , it was a given that the vote to change the system was going to fail . 
  edit : correction , labour promised a * referendum * on pr, 
   i do n't see how speaking the language of my ancestors , can somehow cause any harm to anybody . 
  that wo n't cause harm . 
  refusing to speak anyone else 's language might , though . 
  haha !, 
  your link was awesome . 
  thank you . 
  dude , you just have to look at the shit you post about the uk , and the things you say to its people to understand the downvotes . 
  for example , i seem to recall [ this little gem ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/qod6v/nigeria_deaths_italian_anger_at_uk_over_rescue_bid/c3z7tug ) , yesterday . 
  well , have an upvote , on the house . 
   you are overreacting if i am it is based solely on what you 've said . 
  is what you said ( quoted below ) accurate or not ... ? 
   comments on the italian papers today focus not just on the sad outcome of the raid , but rather on the arrogance of hm 's government , their unability to `` think european '' , their former-empire reflexes , etc. 
  ... yes , or no ? 
   the articles are actually more sad than angry . 
  in the best case the events are an expression of mistrust . 
  from what your quote indicated , it does n't sound `` sad '' to me . 
   comments on the italian papers today focus not just on the sad outcome of the raid , but rather on the arrogance of hm 's government , their unability to `` think european '' , their former-empire reflexes , etc. 
  so , basically , dragging out all the usual silly old insults that get thrown our way whenever we do something some continental country does n't like . 
  the decision not to tell the italians before the raid was based on what the military wanted for safety reasons , not on `` arrogance '' or `` not thinking european '' . 
  how stupid would you have to be to believe any of that ? 
  what are these papers , the intellectual equivalent of the daily mail ? 
  off hand , ca n't remember . 
  i remember my dad ( intelligence corps for 22 years ) complaining about politicians doing stupid shit like telling relatives when a rescue was about to occur . 
  the ethos is - the fewer people know before hand , the higher the likelihood of success ; and that has been developed from experience . 
  there were also things like the bbc announcing the attack on goose green hours before it happened , which could have cost the whole campaign . 
  does n't exactly increase your confidence in the common sense of the average civilian state employee . 
  dude , i 'm explaining why they made that decision . 
  i 'll put money on them taking the same decision again tomorrow . 
  take it or leave it . 
  they were probably briefed on the risk of the italians inadvertently alerting the terrorists to the impending rescue attempt , and decided to remain quiet until the attempt was over . 
  there have been bad experiences in the past with `` courtesy calls '' about rescue attempts blowing the whole operation . 
  well , that would be * a mistake * . 
  notice the capital letters there , for added mistakey-ness . 
  you 're welcome . 
  so very wrong . 
  this could be called `` europe : do n't fuck with whitey '' .

  well , this finally tipped me over into a fit of giggles . 
  this is . . a surprise . 
  for once i 'm lost for words . 
   major_butthurt indeed . 
  yeah , i saw this on the tube the other day . 
  i pointed it out to my wife , who sniggered and then looked guilty and said `` that 's cruel '' . 
  i know . 
  i can barely understand chaucer . 
  well , came here looking forward to seeing a ukip mep get out-debated , and instead ended up listen to some italian dude insult my country ( i think ? ) . 
  from the english in the video :  i think it is deeply possible to reconsile democracy and integration , of course , integration . . of course only a deeply superficial , insular culture might consider that . . er . . might naively . . then switches back to italian . 
  not a slav , i 'm british , but i can understand small chunks of dutch if i concentrate . 
  i 've read that icelandic is very similar to old english , but i ca n't understand a word . 
  despite being an asshat , he 's also very smart , and often right . 
  what he says should be taken seriously . 
  this is really cool . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  erm , pretty sure the comment above yours is meant to be humorous too . 
  what you just described is called `` populism '' in the eu , and `` democracy '' everywhere else . 
  oh you , with your logic and facts , what are you doing posting here ? 
   but it 's long and was probably too difficult for the one-word-at-a-time brits oy !, 
  cheeky !, 
  `` look at the sky ! '', 
  `` which one ? 
  there are so many . . '', 
  `` independent scotland to be utopian ideal , says salmond '' do n't know about you guys , but i 'm convinced . 
  nice link . 
  still , though , i do n't think it follows that that would make the euro the worlds reserve . 
  the us dollar is the currency that is used to purchase the worlds most valuable commodity - crude oil . 
  as long as that remains the case ( and the americans have been very thorough in making sure it remains the case ) , and as long as people buy crude , it 's position is unassailable . 
  it really would n't . 
  ahhhh , i see . 
  virgin sacrifice does n't count if the implement used to make it is your penis . 
  i 'm glad the french are making jokes about this already ; that 's almost . . british . 
  no offense intended . 
  you still think that now after half of europe just got downgraded ? 
  links to the irish sea find ?
