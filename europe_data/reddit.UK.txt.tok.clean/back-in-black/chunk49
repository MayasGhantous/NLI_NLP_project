  look at his comment history . 
  as i said , a fair few other germans * here * ( note : not germans on the whole ) have a bee in their bonnet about us . 
  that is n't bigotry , its observation . 
  in a way , yes . 
  the germans wield too much influence in europe for anyone 's comfort . 
  i 'm beginning to understand why thatcher , years ago , said that she liked germany so much that she preferred to see two of them . 
  perhaps :-), 
  as i explained elsewhere , it does n't want any * eu imposed * regulations to affect the city . 
  the result of those regulations would presumably level the playing field across europe , which would in turn mean that paris and frankfurt could grab some of london 's business . 
  it would also mean that cities like singapore and hong kong would look much more attractive in relation to london , given that they have no external third party imposing regulations upon them . 
  u mad , bro ? 
  merely amused that this is coming from you . 
  lets take a look at your comment history , vis-a-vis the brits , shall we ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/n6te4/i_for_one_welcome_our_new_european_overlords/c36tuej )  and brits are wondring why everyone is starting to hate them . 
  really ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/n6d1r/bye_bye_britain_the_european_unions_new_face/c36syau )  oh , if it was n't for america this might have happend . 
  britain did not do shit , except for being the submissive little bitch it is . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/n6d1r/bye_bye_britain_the_european_unions_new_face/c36ou67 )  i was not asking if britain sucks americas cock , because there is no doubt about that . 
  that is a proven fact even for your fellow countrymen . 
  looks like if anyone is mad , it 's you , bro . 
  you are right in that it needs regulated better than it is currently . 
  but not by an eu primarily run by the germans . 
  the lack of regulation allows us to compete with places like singapore , new york and hong kong , as well as with regional european financial centers . 
  i think it is naive to assume that france and germany will not attempt to pass though legislation that will benefit their own financial capitals at the expense of london , which would also cause additional hurt in terms of our competitiveness with places like singapore . 
  frankfurt has been attempting to grab business from london for years , and continues to do so . 
  it is prudent to assume that the second we let our guard down , the knives will come out . 
  wow . 
  that is a completely idiotic position , if that 's genuinely what they think . 
  ah , yes . 
  this is more like what i was expecting as a response . 
  especially from the germans here , who find it less necessary to mask their hatred every day . 
  perhaps we should wait until you can consider a view other than your own . 
  i suspect that will be a very long wait . 
  you demonstrate a total lack of understanding for the reasons behind our position . 
  i will say again - * we can not * agree to any treaty change which would decimate a large sector of our economy , especially when it looks like the germans and french are dead set on deliberately screwing us with additional taxes and regulation on the city . 
  that is not an ideological position , it is an entirely practical one . 
  to accept the deal on the table would have meant ruin for certain . 
  to reject it is to risk possible ruin . 
  what kind of idiot , except an ideological pro-european , would take the first option ? 
  edit : germany even has a strong motive for screwing over london , given that they want to make frankfurt a financial center at london 's expense . 
   or what do you think the riots where about ? 
  okay , with this comment you have officially declared yourself moronic . 
  i suppose you believe that because you read it in * speigel * , or something similar . 
   stability . 
  giving the french and germans the power to ruin our economy with the stroke of pen is not stability . 
  no , what we did was refuse an obvious losing hand in the hope a better one would come along later . 
  a year is a long time in politics . 
  not really . 
  it makes sarkosy look like a child having a tantrum because one of the big kids in the playground does n't want to be on * his * team . 
  awesome . 
  had to be sure . 
  well . . 
  i was n't expecting * that * as a response . 
  thank you . 
  if that 's really the case , it 's better than being your bitch , mein herr . 
  oh , give me a fucking break . 
  every day is `` hate a brit '' day on this subreddit . 
  not really , no . 
  we accepted rules that destroyed our fishing industry . 
  we accept rules that hurt our agricultural sector . 
  it 's funny how more and more of this subreddit unquestioningly accepts pro-eu propaganda . 
  i was pro-europe when i signed up to this subreddit . 
  now i 'm not even sure we should be in such an organization , as all they seem to want us to do is bend the knee , and accept the cost of doing so , then act all offended when we do n't . 
  that 's a joke , right ? 
  that 's a rather poorly thought through point of view in my opinion . 
  and it 's exactly how france and germany have been spinning this saga for the rest of europe , and as usual , this subreddit has mostly bought into what they say , and cast the uk as the villain . 
  for better and for worse , the uk has made the financial services industry the core of much of what we do as a nation . 
  this means we make a great deal of money from that sector , but it also means we are particularly vulnerable to any changes in financial services legislation imposed by the eu . 
  if you 've ever studied game theory then you might know of a golden rule discovered during the cold war - * never , ever put your opponent in a position where they have only one choice other than defeat * , because they will take that option over defeat almost every time . 
  that is exactly what france and germany did during the latest summit , they put the uk in a position that made the use of the veto inevitable . 
  the uk * can not * allow any treaty to go ahead without safeguards to protect the financial services industry , if we did , then it would mean that france or germany could later push legislation though that would decimate our economy , and they could do it almost at will . 
  therefore , without such safeguards the only reasonable option is to veto any treaty renegotiation that does not contain them . 
  ignorance and lack of empathy are the only explanations i can think of that could explain why someone would consider such a decision `` egotistic '' . 
  so . . if you 're skeptical about handing power to europe then you * must * be a big proponent of furthering american foreign policy ? 
  how does that fucking compute ? 
  dude ... you have this same comment in two different threads . 
  that 's a hell of leap you make there , and you present it as a small logical step . 
  but it assumes a number of things , including the fact that goods and services are always purchased locally , which in this day and age obviously is n't the case . 
  [ the city of london ] ( http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/corporation/lgnl_services/business/business_support_and_advice/economic_information_and_analysis/research+and+statistics+faq.htm ) claims that it provides over 11 % ( over 52 billion ) of tax revenue . 
  that * is * a massive chunk of the nations income from a small section of central london . 
  errm , no . 
  a massive chunk of the nations income comes from the city . 
  any eu imposed tax that hurts the city will hurt the national budget as a whole . 
  i did n't think they were misleading . 
  seemed quite obvious to me that the flooding would be localised to iceland . 
  if you think that was hate , then i do n't think you know what hate is . 
   it seems like you contradict yourself . 
  each country will decide for themselves . 
  if 2 countries want a new federation , you ca n't stop them . 
  we can stop them . 
  we can veto the decision within the current agreed upon framework . 
  if they want to leave that framework and set up their own organization with the goal of a federation , then good luck to them . 
  but to expect us to leave because we 're not playing ball is perverse . 
   if 26 countries want a new federation , you ca n't stop them . 
  you can either join the federation and give up sovereignty , or not join it and become weaker . 
  i mean , this is basic logic , is n't it ? 
  yet again you assume the majority desire is for a federation . 
  it is n't . 
   but ... in regards to the eurozone , you 're not in it . 
  and thank god .
