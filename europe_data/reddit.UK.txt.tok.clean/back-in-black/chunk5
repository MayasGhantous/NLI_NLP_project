   this is simply a chicken and egg problem . 
  no it is n't . 
  you 're just saying that because you believe that it then leads to the easy solution you 've proposed , which is n't realistic . 
   you 're saying do n't integrate more because you 're not integrated enough . 
  it makes no sense whatsoever . 
  i do n't understand what you 're trying to say with this sentence . 
  edit : actually , come to think of it , the great irony of you using the uk as an example is that the uk shows what the a laborious and fragile process it is before you can unite to form a combined armed forces . 
  1 ) use of a common language , and allow the beginnings of a common culture to form , 2 ) political union , meaning you then get common foreign and domestic policies , 3 ) many decades later - amalgamation of armed forces , followed rapidly by a series of wars in which the identity and ethos of those armed forces is forged . 
  even after all that , in under 300 years , it can all just start falling apart . 
   actual standing army , along the lines of the us military . 
  this us military does n't have the language issue . 
  anyone who joins , has to speak english . 
  i can only imagine the shitstorm that would be thrown on the continent if we announced an eu army with english as its common language . 
   then problems of equipment and armament are temporary , if a long term strategy is created - start with national militaries and a small eu military , with eu equipment , and expand from there . 
  this is glossing over a large and complex issue - who gets to manufacture the arms ? 
  who decides on the equipment set ? 
  because * every * nation with an arms manufacturing base is going to want to get a piece of that pie . 
  says the guy from a * 300 year old * union with it 's own army . 
  with a common language , command structure , a common equipment set , and a common ethos . 
  all forged during a time of civil wars , revolutions , and more revolutions . 
  a photographed piece of paper moving between the foreign office and downing st only proves that a civil servant suggested a course of action , it 's not proof of existing policy . 
  further more , your link is a bit old . 
  here is a more recent guardian article : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/ukraine-uk-push-sanctions-russia-crimea the uk is saying current sanctions enacted by the uk/eu are too weak and is pushing for more . 
  edit : and what was actually on the paper was : `` the uk should not support * for now * , trade sanctions ... or close london 's financial centre to russians '' ( emphasis mine ) edit2 : `` damage to the british economy by sanctions against russia are a `` price worth paying '' , says hague http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/04/28/uk-economy-hague_n_5224462.html, 
   after all , we have a nice , non-russian dominated continent of our own tldr : [ `` i 'm alright , jack '' ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=i%27m%20all%20right%20jack ! ), 
  its not clear what he had in mind for the uk . 
  it was suggested by churchill . . 
  because we thought it was a shit idea , and , oh look , it turned out to be a shit idea . 
   `` us requests france mop up remaining russian seamen '', 
  bullshit opinion editorials are bullshit regardless of whether they 're originally printed in german or english . 
  it 's the usual der speigel combination of whiny and patronizing . 
   i just shortened the title : if you used the automated title generator then it took the title from the page metadata - which for some reason , is completely different from the * actual * title . 
   i think it is safe to say that editorial reflects the opinion of most people in the eu about britain . 
  well if that 's true , then that 's very unfortunate , because the article is patronising in the extreme , and completely misrepresents the uks position . 
  editorialised headline . 
  the actual headline is :  `` britain must choose now if it will stay in europe '' with a subheading of :  `` for years britain has blackmailed and made a fool out of the eu . 
  the united kingdom must finally make a choice : it can play by the rules or it can leave the european union . '', 
  which , frankly , is the most stupid thing i 've seen speigel come out with to date . 
  did you see the headline and subheading ? 
  edit : and why did you modify the headline when you submitted it ? 
  it does n't look like he sees the brits as part of his plans though , which is interesting . 
  maybe he 's lumped us in with the americans ? 
   same goddamn excuse as the av referendum , with the same impotent result . 
  it 's not an excuse . 
  it 's the truth . 
  england was never given the option for the deal the rest of the uks devolved parliaments got . 
  you can squirm all you want and claim england ( the little bit of the ne that was allowed to vote on it ) should have simply voted for change , but the fact remains ; * england was never offered the same deal * . 
  so please stop claiming that we were . 
  it 's not true , and you 're clearly aware that it 's not true . 
   the rest of the country had the same opportunity and it threw it away . 
  it 's not getting special treatment , it 's the rest of the country which renounced their voice . 
  this is not true , and i wish people would stop claiming this was the case . 
  the deal that was offered was * regional assemblies for england * , not an english parliament with the same sort of devolved powers as the parliaments in wales , scotland and ni . 
  the only part of england offered a choice on the matter was the ne of england , and i ca n't blame them for looking at it and saying `` nah , this is shit '' , and voting no . 
  the rest of england was never offered a choice on the matter . 
  the trouble is , the `` no '' vote here would cover both : people who wanted an english parliament ; and people who wanted to stick with the status quo . 
  when english people attempt to point out that scotland gets special treatment ( which it * does * ) , the tired old `` you voted no for the same '' always gets dragged out . 
  it is n't true , and never has been . 
  that was actually kind of sweet . 
  yeah . 
  how exactly did he manage to forget that bit ? 
  `` because its bigger '' is n't exactly a rock sold line of reasoning . 
  americans can be really strange about this stuff : `` nuclear fission ? 
  check . 
  put a man on the moon ? 
  check . 
  provide free health care for populace ? 
  oh my fucking god its too hard its impossible we 're too big '', 
  putin `` the great '' of russia ( hostile ) : `` i knew i was wasting my time with you . . '', 
  i agree . 
  one of the things i find most irritating about the eu is the blinkered insistence on delineating what is and is n't `` europe '' , and therefore , who can be part of the club , and who will forever be excluded from it , no matter what they do . 
  you can see it in here on conversations about turkey . 
  i guarantee you if constantinople had n't fallen ~ 600 years ago there would be no debate about whether anatolia was part of `` europe '' or not . 
  but instead , the majority seem to think it 's okay to say that yes , the greeks are part of europe , but no , the turks are not . 
  as if a few miles of water constituted a permanent and irrevocable barrier . 
  they manage to hold that belief whilst simultaneously insisting that the uk is an * integral * part of europe despite being separated by a watery barrier of approximately equal size . 
  when you ask * why * people east of greece ( and south of spain ) are to be forever excluded you get stuff like :  `` oh , they are so culturally different . 
  they have different concerns . '', 
   `` yes , they are soooo culturally different . '', 
   `` yes , they could never be a part of europe , because they are sooo different . 
  culturally . '', 
  what the fuck does that even mean ? 
  `` culturally different '' ? 
  does a few miles of water between greece and turkey become such an insurmountable problem that it means i can never have common citizenship with the person on the other side ? 
  does that mean that i 'm ( as a brit ) supposed to have more in common `` culturally '' with the average greek than i do with the average turk ? 
  because in my experience , that is n't true . 
  having lived in germany and in many anglophone countries , i 've found i have more in common `` culturally '' with the average canadian , the average aussie , and the average kiwi , than i do with the average german . 
  does that then mean that the germans are `` too culturally different '' for me to ever share a passport with one ? 
  if not , then why exclude people like the turks on that basis ? 
  i honestly think that the `` culturally different '' argument we see bandied about a lot , when applied to turkey , and russia and north africa , for that matter , is in many cases simply a convenient smoke screen for xenophobia . 
  and i think that future borders of the eu , as envisioned by a lot of the people driving it 's growth , is an impoverished vision that will ultimately end up excluding tens of millions of people for no real reason other than fear . 
  `` you failed to keep your border expansion promise ''  :-(, 
  oh , god , i just found [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmovewtdycs ) one watching some of the old clips . 
  it is brilliant . 
  my sides are split . 
  indeed . 
  i 'm sure you know the old story about `` yes , minister '' and `` yes , prime minister '' - the show writers all used to hang out in the bars around westminister and talk with mps , civil servants , and various other folk who worked in the area . 
  it 's why the material still seems so relevant decades later . 
  the very best satire stays close to the truth . 
  he 's from norway , i 'm betting he 's an * actual * troll .
