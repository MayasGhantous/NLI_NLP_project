   silly spelling  german flair http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/023/007/f29.png, 
  hurts my eyes tbh, 
  every post in this thread puts britons in the same pot . 
  when you 're discussing nationalities you have to make generalisations to some degree . 
   i have no idea where this assumption comes from . 
  i think it 's because they see britons mouthing off against eu and brexit politicians saying , to put it in a simplified sentence , `` make britain great again '' and then they think that means that we want our empire back or some shit . 
  when you put it that way it makes us sound like the best nation ever, 
  i wish we could fit a dragon on there . 
  would be badass . 
  yeah , we admire the * image * of boadicea - a heroine rallying her troops against the forces of an evil empire , as you said - not so much her actual achievements irl . 
  i 've been enjoying peep show recently . 
  you know it bruh . 
  all these mediterranean nations looking down their nose at us northern europeans , but meat and potatoes is where it 's at . 
  that guy is a trump supporter , he 's just baiting y' all into shitting on the uk lol, 
  i 'm sorry man but you 're just throwing out anecdotes and generalisations now . 
  face it , you lost and you 're full of shit . 
  over . 
  why does the rest of europe think this ? 
  the only people who say `` back in the good old days of the empire ... '' are either a ) saying it ironically or b ) 80 year olds . 
   europe thrives off hate and xenophobia meanwhile the us just elected trump, 
  bruh you 're projecting by saying that i 'm projecting, 
  christ , you 'd think the eu was your mother the way you 're reacting to what i said mate . 
  you need to seek help , and i 'm not kidding either . 
   fledgling superpower http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/021/557/conceit.jpg, 
  i would n't like a fledgling superpower suddenly appearing on our doorstep . 
  most of the time they really are n't , it 's just most people ca n't handle a joke when it 's told to them by some anonymous user on the internet . 
  / r/europe is bitter as fuck lol, 
  i was making a joke, 
  okay look mate , when i meant `` access to the rest of the continent '' i meant it is easily reachable for holidays , day trips , business or whatever . 
  i did n't mean to work or live . 
  but it will almost certainly be easier for british citizens to relocate to continental europe than most others . 
  `` surges '' by eurozone standards is like 0.0001 % tho, 
  til after brexit nobody from the british isles will be allowed to step foot on the continent of europe, 
   ** some ** europeans are racist towards not just muslims , even muslim cats . 
  please do n't put us all in one box , thanks . 
  weird , every other source has been saying that brexit has had little impact on growth . 
  many agencies have had to revise their predictions for the uk upward . 
  pardon me if i do n't take a source entitled `` https://www.neweurope.eu '' to be 100 % accurate, 
  lol okay bud , i 'm not gon na convince you so i 'm not going to bother . 
  you should have learned though . 
  your post history is just you getting massively shit on by europeans while you cry `` yuropoors are jealous !!!, 
  i mean , i would probably have learned if i got put down so many times . 
  americans are real insecure when it comes to their nationality . 
  that 's why some of them have backpacks with canadian flags on and shit ... 
   america is far more tolerant and inclusive . 
  that 's funny because america sent jewish refugees back to europe to meet their death in the holocaust . 
   no , people like peter thiel and sergey brin both of those people moved to the us when they were infants lmao i swear your entire post history is just you being angry at europeans . 
  you 've got a real chip on your shoulder . 
   nope , i 've been to the uk as i have relatives there sure you have bud . 
   i 've seen the statistics as well well then you 'd know that the average brit is better off than the average american lmao  wales might as well be behind the iron curtain conveniently cherry picking one of the comparatively poorer regions of the uk , particularly southern wales . 
  still better off than the us though . 
   and how little people cared about their lives . 
  what does this even mean ? 
   europe is just a land of mediocrity funny how europe has the best standard of the living in the world then lol . 
  but that does n't matter , america put someone on the moon so usa no # 1 and nothing can change that amirite . 
   while america was taking humanity into space http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=armstrong%27s%20law, 
   most of britain outside london looks incredibly poor too . 
  i live outside of london and have been all over the uk outside of london . 
  you 're so , so wrong , fucking hell . 
  once again , you 're demonstrating the op 's point . 
  you 're telling me what ** my country ** is like without having been there ( im assuming this because you said ` looks ' poor , implying you have not been there yourself ) . 
  it 's just pathetic . 
  just like all the trumplets tell swedish people what their country is like . 
   and how all the high achieving europeans prefer to be in america . 
  what is this worthless platitude ? 
  you mean celebrities and shit ? 
  well yeah , nobody can argue that america 's cultural presence is huge . 
  celebrity culture is also a way bigger deal in the us than in most other countries . 
  and i thought we were referring to the quality of life for the average american vs the average swede . 
  not the top 1 % ers . 
   slovakia is practically third world oh dear, 
   sweden should have provoked an international crisis over donald trump 's remarks i 'm sorry but kicking off an `` international crisis '' because an idiotic foreign politician decided to pander to people is n't worth it, 
   where everyone wants to live the only truth in your post bro, 
  i want to reply to your comment and just disprove everything but i 'd have to write a fucking essay to correct everything you said . 
  but yeah , you 're twisted dude . 
  the world is not white people vs everyone else . 
  or everyone else vs asians . 
  i see from your post history you 're one of those asian supremacist `` white pigdogs have had their time !! '', 
  people , and i doubt someone is gon na be able to change you with a reddit comment , so i 'll just leave you get on with those ... ideas . 
   what makes you say i 'm altright ? 
  your post history . 
   give it 5 years and the top 10 will be full of asian countries i 'm sorry but the only ones that are ** remotely ** close are south korea and japan and they 're already fully developed . 
   europe is the past yeah , from the roman empire through to the dominance of our empires in the modern world we are indeed the defining continent of the past . 
   so are white people bit of random racism there ? 
  odd . 
   you 're less and less relevant and influential funny when white people lead the usa , russia , every european nation and the vast majority of south american nations , australia , nz and canada . 
  regardless , i do n't understand why that matters ? 
  ~ ~ of course you 'd say that , you 're an american . ~ ~ an alt right goon . 
  not sure if you 're canadian or american or what . 
  stupid sexy bologna, 
  we 're hitting / r/all now , prepare for triggered americans, 
  well i did say there was triggered trumplets in this thread . 
  am i wrong ? 
   it 's a good measure of the economic aptitude of the nation , actually . 
  no , no , you cited it as `` earnings '' . 
  you literally said this . 
   i did n't mention salary , i mentioned gdp per capita you referred to it as earnings . 
   unfortunately for us europeans you have a weird way of being european since your entire post history is just you taking one massive dump on europe .
