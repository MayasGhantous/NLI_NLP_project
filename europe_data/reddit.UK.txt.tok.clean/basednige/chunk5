  where the facts at tho ? 
  and do n't come here with breitbart and infowars sources fam . 
  first of all , gdp per capita is not a measure of the wealth of the individual . 
  second of all , it took you 49 minutes to come up with a bullshit answer about salary ? 
  when the post in the op has 13 categories , you come back with 1 category and cite it as a victory ? 
  we were arguing about development were we not , not the richness of the country ? 
  lmao . 
  be a brit fam . 
  best of both worlds - you 're european , have access to the rest of the continent , and you have top universities like oxford , cambridge , lse and all the free healthcare and shit . 
  i struggle to understand why any of this is relevant . 
  these statistics represent the lives of the average citizen . 
  the average citizen does not end up in wall street , silicon valley or at a top university like harvard . 
  i fully agree with you that if i was born into a well off family in a good area i would rather live in the united states because of the opportunities . 
  but the reality is not everyone is born into a well off family in a good area . 
  til every american ends up working in silicon valley and wall street . 
  not like those sectors are reserved for graduates of elite ivy league universities or anything . 
  that 's mean, 
  but they 're not , as the inequality adjusted hdi proves . 
  i would rather live in slovakia than japan or the usa mate . 
   its their wacko president and his deplorable followers who do that . 
  which is a sizable portion of americans . 
   well-informed , educated , sane americans ( the only ones who matter , really ) well they clearly do n't since they do n't have a well informed , educated and sane government in power . 
  these images are not a response to the well informed and educated americans , they 're a response to the trumplets . 
  americans should stop raving about `` swedenistan '' and `` londonistan '' and `` germanistan '' and how we 're a complete shithole then . 
  itt : triggered trumplets edit : also i 'd just like to give this wackjob some publicity lol https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5v4a51/life_in_sweden_versus_life_in_the_united_states/ddzawcj/, 
  tfw 9 of the top 10 are european countries europe stronk, 
  hdi is such a broken measurement . 
  look at inequality adjusted hdi if you want a better measure . 
  so we 're apparently shit at maths but good at science ? 
  bizarre , the two are usually linked . 
  well , not so much at a 15 year old level i suppose , which is the pisa test level i think . 
  you guys are being a bit harsh on him lmao, 
  fuck the media these days , honestly . 
  every goddamn title is clickbait, 
  really not sure . 
  all the things i can find on it is just `` northumbria '' -  northumberland which is of anglo-saxon origin . 
  our education system is really hit and miss . 
  some schools are great and others garbage . 
  it 's not very consistent at all . 
  when people say `` free '' it 's typically shorthand for `` free at the point of use '' . 
  nobody with a brain thinks we get healthcare from nowhere . 
  where would we get it from , the healthcare fairy ? 
  ** u n e l e c t e d ** ** b u r e a u c r a t s **, 
  i just assumed he was another fellow briton who had a poor command of foreign languages . 
  pain au chocolat * edit : also i do n't speak french but is n't `` chocolatine au chocolat '' redundant ? 
  i think it 's somewhere on the south coast like portsmouth , not sure though, 
  you seem bitter as hell lol . 
  did a brit fuck your mother or something ? 
  never seen someone get so upset over a country . 
   ~ ~ england ~ ~ united kingdom , france or spain well , france and the uk are still important, 
  sad, 
  people on this sub have a real hard on about banning religious shit . 
  literally everyone i know who has been baptized is not religious . 
  depends on the country . 
  but even still , the reason the americans speak english is because of the empire . 
  yeah , we do n't need to learn a second language cause everyone speaks english anyway lmao, 
  i 'm not sure , an idea i heard being floated around was that brits who wanted it could apply for some sort of `` associate '' eu citizenship in exchange for a contribution/yearly contribution to the eu or something along those lines , which could work . 
  from what i read about the british military it seems we want fancy tech but not a lot of it . 
  we fund advanced drones and stuff and then buy like 2 or 3 of them lmao . 
  go big or go home imo . 
  these maps are so fucking shit and unfunny, 
  christ what a bellend lol, 
  3/4 of those are proper shitholes . 
  durham city is lovely though . 
  ayyy my hometown, 
  christ those are so shit . 
  i 'd expect nothing less of you, 
  yup same . 
  never really felt `` european '' . 
  it feels like i have more in common with australians , new zealanders , canadians and americans than `` continental '' europeans . 
  it 's probably the language barrier . 
  also the fact it 's hard to feel european when the rest of the world , even a lot of europeans , views you as `` seperate '' from europe by some degree . 
  these people listen to the words of some brexit politicians and then take them as the word of the whole uk . 
  it 's sad . 
  87 % of our population is white - are you accusing all white british people of being racists without stating it outright ? 
  apologies for not getting it , it seems a majority of people who replied to his comment did n't understand that it was a joke either . 
  what ? 
  this is always the top comment on these posts lol `` uk doing well ? 
  better make a dumbarse comment about the attitudes of a minority of the population , that 'll show em ' '', 
  it is true , but he 's taking the piss . 
  after the brexit vote , and the pound plummeted , remainers went `` see !, 
  we told you ! '', 
  and held it up as evidence that the vote to leave was a mistake . 
  now that the uk is doing well , remainers say `` well , we have n't even left yet ! '', 
  when they were happy to act as smug as leavers are acting now . 
  you 're the type of guy who says `` m ` lady '' and wields a katana are n't you, 
  lol hate us cause you anus, 
  the organisation has always been publicly traded . 
   this while saying you wanted to take back control of the country . 
  first of all , only * some * politicians/brexiteers said that , and when they * did * say that , they were referring to eu laws . 
  letting a publicly traded company be - y' know - traded , is n't an example of that . 
   i did read the comment really ? 
  because the rest of the argument you put forward has been addressed by many other comments in this thread , including that one . 
  never change , / r/europe, 
  this sub is sad . 
  the only reasonable comment is at the bottom of the thread , which actually explains the article , and the rest are just `` lol uk really taking back control lolol '' wankfest . 
  it 's just sad . 
  it 's just sad that / u/h33i0 's comment is so far down . 
  the rest above are just `` lol uk really taking back control there lolololol '' fucks sake , / r/europe . 
  i swear you spout so much fucking nonsense .
