there is usually a residency requirement - something like 3 to 5 years . 
  he 's lost a lot of weight - he loves his curries but he 's on a diet . 
  strangely , a rarely aired film , [ guns at batasi ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058166/ ) , was on the telly just a few days ago - great film , incredible performance from attenborough . 
  just in case there is any doubt - [ scottish independence : jean-claude juncker ` not referring to scotland ' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-28311938 ) . 
  and guess who connived to hold the armed forces day in stirling on the same day as the bannockburn commemorations ? 
  bound to be another one - not if we vote `` yes '' mate . 
  not being in the tournament and most of us being sat at home to watch i think you 'll find that most of us are just wanting good exiting football and are not bothered too much about who wins . 
  as for germany , i am in two minds ; one part of me wants germany to have a shit tournament with everyone falling out so that when we play you on 7th september your team will be a complete shambles . 
  on the other hand , if you win the tournament , then stuffing you lot on 7th september will be all the sweeter ( and bring more fifa ranking points ) . 
  good to see those commenting btl have reacted to this story with calmness and stoicism and have maintained their perspective . 
  i agree that was two countries becoming one , however , did that result in east germany 's immediately accordance with eec rules and regs ? 
  in scotland 's case it is already in accordance with all eu rules and regs with the addition that its inhabitants have been eu citizens for over 40 years . 
  i take your point about re-assessing the uk 's position . 
  there seems to have been a general acceptance of the uk governments position ( a campaigning position ) on the way the break-up is to happen , when in reality the actual breakup will be as a result of negotiations . 
  their current position is that ruk will assume all the rights and privileges of a continuing state - including membership of international bodies - and that scotland will have to start everything from scratch ( they also claim a right to all the assets but that we would have to share the liabilities - logically consistency of their arguments does not seem of great importance to them especially when they have the full force of the msm , sunday herald excepted , on their side ) . 
  as other break-ups show , however , this does not have to be the case . 
  indeed the house of commons library researchers prepared a paper , discussed in [ this article ] ( http://eutopialaw.com/2011/11/14/685/ ) , which describes three possible scenarios , each with their own set of consequences and precedents . 
  my own opinion is that if there is a `` yes '' vote then most countries will be happy to fall into line behind whatever scotland and ruk agrees . 
  east germany - given a free pass , immediately . 
  you are aware of the story of king cnut ? 
  the black-caspian-aral seas all seam to be part of an ancient cascade system connected by spillways - given a source of water they would presumably all fill up again . 
  [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epoch_of_extremal_inundations ) - scroll down to cascade of eurasians basins . 
  sadly this care free attitude is not restricted to russians . 
  the uk has dumped thousands of tonnes of munitions in the [ irish sea ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/tons-of-arms-dumped-at-sea-1601949.html ) . 
  apparently the dump site is also close to an undersea gas pipeline . 
  but it is not just the obviously dangerous dumping of munitions that is of concern ; currently several beaches in fife are closed due to radioactive contamination from discarded raf ( glow in the dark ) instrument dials . 
  i wonder how many nations around europe have similar problems lurking ? 
  is it too early for the nuclear option - removal of all irn bru privileges ? 
  in scotland we have gone from hydro producing 93.8 % ( 4,665 gwh ) of renewables in 2000 to only 32.8 % ( 4,844 gwh ) in 2012 due to increases in wind , wave , tidal and solar . 
  these have increased ( as a percentage of renewables ) from 4.4 % ( 217gwh ) in 2000 to 56 % ( 8,264 gwh ) in 2012 . 
  so it is possible . 
  there are 28 members of nato . 
  of these , three are nuclear states and five host us nuclear weapons - belgium , germany , italy , the netherlands and turkey ( although i think that the netherlands has been trying to get rid of these for a number of years ) . 
  so , if scotland does join nato that would mean that there would be 21 nato members without nuclear weapons on their soil - why should scotland be singled out for criticism ? 
  if scotland did accept nuclear weapons on its soil it would be breaking the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . 
   the uk government has confirmed that scotland would be banned from having nuclear weapons after independence under non-proliferation treaty rules . 
    coalition government offi-cials have acknowledged that , under international law , scotland `` would not be recognised as a state entitled to possess a nuclear deterrent '' . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/independent-scotland-faces-nuclear-arms-ban-1-2807469 ), 
   scotland would be doing something antithetical to nato 's objectives . 
  i disagree . 
  consistent with the strategic concept and their commitments under existing arms control treaties and frameworks , allies will continue to support arms control , disarmament and non-proliferation efforts . 
  ** we are resolved to seek a safer world for all and create the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons ** in accordance with the goal of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty ( npt ) . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_68828.htm ) we would be helping nato to achieve one of its objectives ( * a little faster than they intended , i grant you * ) - unless they are bullshitting us of course . 
  edit : in italics, 
  interesting . 
  in scotland we are currently being told that if we vote for independence and then choose to ban nuclear wmd 's from our shores that we would be blackballed from nato . 
  yet here we have an ex-pm of nuclear-wmd-free norway being hailed as the next nato chief . 
   the results of the online poll of 20,000 people ** between 7 and 20 january ** i think the timing is quite important . 
  i 'd go with ** dighted ** - unreasonably merry , a bit of a fool ; or ** feechs/feechie ** - unclean , which gives rise to the expression feechie touch and a game played by school children which exposes them at an early age to the concept of social exclusion . 
   presumably you place as much stock in the betting odds for the result of the referendum i do n't put much stock in betting odds if i ever pay any attention to them at all . 
  i did say `` just as a bit of fun '' . 
  i was talking about making a change in scotland . 
  all students to be charged a tuition fee and students who meet a residency requirement would receive a tuition grant . 
  the residency requirement was something like five years - ca n't remember exactly . 
  grants were only available for first degrees . 
  i agree totally with what you are saying about what debt is doing to people , unfortunately all i can do is sympathise . 
  best of luck with the masters - it should stand you in good stead . 
  one solution/mitigation might be to charge everyone tuition fees and go back to the old system that saw students get a grant for their tuition costs . 
  when i attended university we got two grants - one a maintenance grant the other a tuition grant . 
  i received mine from the scottish education department while english students got theirs from their local authority . 
  i do n't know if this would fall foul of the eu rules and regs . 
  and yes , i am ancient by reddit standards . 
   even a medium term currency union with ruk is impossible that 'll be why carney took the time to come up to edinburgh to continue the technical discussions . 
  i have previously argued against looking at the odds bookies are offering as any sort of guide - but just as a bit of fun here is a ladbrokes press release [ ladbrokes : scotland 1/100 to enter currency union - 50/1 not to - scotland certs for currency union ] ( http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/92105/ladbrokes_scotland_1_100_to_enter_currency_union_50_1_not_to.html ), 
  as i said - it is a problem . 
  you are right , this is a problem . 
  it is a problem created in westminster and is unique to scotland ( must admit to complete lack of knowledge as to the situation in n ireland and wales ) . 
  no other eu member state has a * much larger * neighbour who speaks the same language and has such a divergent policy on the level of student tuition fees . 
  belgium has the much larger france to contend with , however the difference in fees is minimal as [ the table in this article ] ( http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2013/03/04/paying-for-higher-education/ ) shows ( figures slightly out of date ) . 
  similarly austria has germany as a neighbour , but again the level of fees are minimal in both countries . 
  so the impetus for french or german students swamping the belgian or austrian university systems to take advantage of lower fees just does not exist . 
  it is england that is the outlier with respect to the level of student tuition fees . 
  my guess is that this will be a major part of the eu membership negotiations . 
  scotland 's share of the eu rebate will be probably have to be conceded ; the eu giving some opt out for this may be the compensation sought and the eu may be quite willing to give this up . 
  edit : in italics, 
   it does n't rule out an independent scotland aspiring to enter the euro you are perfectly correct . 
  there is nothing stopping scotland from considering to adopt the euro in the future . 
  that will be a matter for the people and the parliament of an independent scotland to consider . 
  the immediate concern is the currency immediately following independence - that time period will not cover a situation where use of the euro is possible due to the convergence criteria , therefore it is a red herring . 
  it seems you did not read the linked article . 
  scotland would not meet the criteria to be allowed to adopt the euro ; * budget deficit must be < 3 % of gdp . 
  the uk is currently running a deficit of 6.3 % . 
  while scotland will be in a more favourable position this will not be sufficient to meet this criteria . 
  * the debt-to-gdp ratio must be < 60 % or falling . 
  the uk 's ratio is 90 % and rising . 
  if scotland adopts a share of the uk debt there is no way it would pass this test . 
  not sure what you are getting at . 
  who is proposing the manipulation of macroeconomic statistics ? 
  i did n't suggest that and i can not see anyone else on this thread suggesting that . 
  the budget deficit and debt-to-gdp ratios do not need to be manipulated to fail the test - unfortunately we are in a position where we fail with flying colours at the moment ( uk and scotland ) . 
  there is a far easier way of avoiding the euro , the method sweden has adopted , that is simply not joining erm2 . 
  being a member of erm2 for a period of two years is mandatory prior to adopting the euro . 
  becoming a member of erm2 is voluntary - you can not be forced to join . 
   i would n't expect the english to be in a good mood . 
  we 're getting the jilted teenager attitude already . 
  not a chance . 
  * the [ 1949 scottish covenant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_covenant ) , claimed to have been signed by over 2 million people , was ignored .
