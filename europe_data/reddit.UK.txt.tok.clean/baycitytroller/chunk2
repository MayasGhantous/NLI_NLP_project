  scotland voted `` yes '' but was thwarted by the 40 % rule . 
  the incoming conservative government refused to consider any form of devolution . 
  * the labour party 's `` one nation '' policy looks to rule out any further devolution with labour mp 's saying that devolution has gone too far and there needs to be a more unified approach to things like the nhs . 
  * currently some scottish labour mp 's are about to [ boycott their own scottish conference ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/labour-mps-plan-conference-boycott-amid-income-tax-row.23365395 ) due to `` leadership '' proposals to fully devolve income tax to scotland . 
  * conservative `` leader '' in scotland , ruth davidson , has previously drawn `` a line in the sand '' as far as any further devolution is concerned . 
  david cameron has previously stated that there would be [ no further tax powers for scotland ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/no-further-tax-powers-for-scotland-says-david-cameron-1-2084365 ) . 
  why should we believe any change of heart . 
  saying `` vote no and we 'll talk about further powers '' is a bit like a hostage negotiator saying `` release the hostages and give us your gun , then we 'll talk about your helicopter '' . 
  the only thing scotland will get if we vote no is a complete shafting . 
  i think the time for any leeway on conditions for using the euro are well and truly over - see greece . 
   as to the likelihood of independence - the polls are moving and the establishment are shitting bricks . 
  [ newsnight 6 feb ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=f1a7symq_gu ), 
  i understand what you are saying but the fact remains that the govt continues to use language that leaves the possibility of some form of monetary union . 
  if they are so against it then that raises the question - why do n't they rule it out ? 
  as for dealing with scotland as a foreign country , you may not be aware of [ this ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/geo6/12-13-14/41/section/2 ) - that was after a bitter and bloody conflict . 
  scotland and ruk will continue to have the same head of state and will share many institutions - we might not be as foreign as you think . 
  edit : i became * aware * a word was missing . 
  given that scotland does not currently meet [ the requirements for using the euro ] ( http://www.arcofprosperity.org/scotland-and-the-euro-convergence-criteria/ ) ( and is unlikely to do so for some time - as is the case for the uk ) nobody is going to be proposing that scotland adopts it as their currency . 
  the euro is an irrelevance as far as the independence debate is concerned - any mention of it is to try to maintain the fear and uncertainty that is the sum total of the better together campaign . 
  you 'll excuse me if i could n't give a fuck what you think . 
  [ this guy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=f1a7symq_gu ) seems to have a bit of a clue though . 
  you are probably unaware of a major problem with the survation survey to do with their weighting methodology . 
   the effect of survation 's weighting , predictably , has been to increase the estimated no lead considerably . 
  before the data were weighted at all ( including to make sure that the sample matches the demographic profile of scotland ) , the yes tally stood as high as 43 % ( after the do n't knows are excluded ) . 
  the weighting has knocked as much as five points off that figure . 
  it looks highly likely that if survation had followed the same practice as most other pollsters , the reported yes vote in this poll would have been over 40 % -- just as it was in last weekend 's icm poll and is in this weekend 's tns bmrb poll . 
  [ link ] ( http://blog.whatscotlandthinks.org/2014/02/survation-enter-the-fray/ ) there is also a mystery about the latest yougov poll and some possible missing yougov polls . 
  4 feb - [ trying to make sense of yougov 's latest idiocy ( it is n't easy ) ] ( http://scotgoespop.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/trying-to-make-sense-of-yougovs-latest.html ) 6 feb - [ yougov 's ` phantom poll ' comes in from the cold - but serious unanswered questions remain ] ( http://scotgoespop.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/yougov-poll-comes-in-from-cold-but.html ) the point i made still stands - it is about the direction of travel with the `` no '' lead being cut from 30 % to 19 % ( yougov ) . 
  the different pollsters all give different figures for support for each camp but the movement they report is all in the same direction and the `` no '' lead being cut by roughly by the same amount * tns-bmrb -9 % * icm -10 % * yougov -11 %, 
  what is needed is a clear statement by the uk government and the leaders of the labour and libdem parties that they will refuse to even negotiate a currency union . 
  this is the only way that uncertainty can be eliminated ( just as the uk govt could easily resolve any uncertainty around eu membership ) . 
  but they will not . 
  they will continue to use words like `` unlikely '' , `` can not foresee '' etc to maintain the fear factor they have been generating since this campaign started . 
  i suspect that immediately following a `` yes '' vote the ceos of asda , tesco , morrisons , m&s , kingfisher , arcadia , etc will put pressure on the uk govt to accept some form of currency sharing arrangement to ensure their businesses ( which must have several hundreds of # millions worth of investment in scotland ) do not have to suffer the transactional costs that would arise by refusing to share . 
  this would also be of benefit to the people who work for these companies and whose jobs rely , in part , on exporting to scotland ( ruk 's second biggest export market ) . 
  pretty selective polling choice by reuters as well . 
  it would appear they have chosen the latest tns-bmrb poll . 
  what is more enlightening than the actual polling figures are the trends ; this poll shows a continuing drop in support for the union - 9 % since the late summer . 
  alternatively they could have chosen the most recent icm poll which has `` yes '' on 37 % and `` no '' on 44 % . 
  that is a lead of only 7 % and a movement on icms figures from a lead of 17 % for `` no '' . 
  tl : dr then you will have missed the postscript . 
   it is worth noting that mr barroso is now encountering vehemently pointed criticism of his half-truths on this subject :   `` the economist and columbia university professor , xavier sala i mart\u00edn , criticized the attitude and position of jos\u00e9 manuel durao barroso , the president of the european commission , to his face on the possible independence of catalonia or scotland . 
  according to a story in el mundo , sala i mart\u00edn addressed barroso in a private dinner on january 23 in the hotel intercontinental in davos , where the world economic forum was being held , and which the economist regularly attends . 
  [ ... ]   sala i mart\u00edn got the microphone and asked , ` you 'll give european citizenship to the citizens of the balkans , who became independent after bloody wars , and you will expel those of us who already have european citizenship ? 
  us , who do n't kill for secession , who only raise the question in a peaceful way , through voting ? ', 
  [ ... ]   ` we have european citizenship and you want to take it from us . 
  you will have to explain your reasoning ! ', 
  barroso did not answer [ ... ] '' ( vilaweb , february 2nd 2014 ) ( links to cited articles in the original post ), 
  you sure about that ? 
  i think the creditors might have something to say , along the lines of `` get tae '' - i 'm not sure what the english translation would be . 
  i think you are confusing the position of the treasury ( who are the debtor ) with that of the bondholders ( the creditors ) . 
   what are the advantages to westminster of scotland keeping the pound and boe ? 
  apart from the transactional cost saving to ruk businesses trading into scotland there is the benefit to the current account of having imports from scotland not being in another currency . 
  the value of scotland 's exports to the row would also boost the strength of sterling . 
  it would also save the boe having to hand back several billions to rbs , bos and clydesdale bank - they have to deposit a sum equivalent to the amount of notes they issue with the boe . 
  ca n't disagree with too much you have said other than your question about what would scotland have to give up in return ; if something is in both parties interests and brings advantages to each , why would either have to give up anything in return ? 
  any division would be a private arrangement between iscotland and ruk as it would be impossible to assign the debt to iscotland without the bondholders permissions . 
  so ruk would be stuck with them . 
  in any event westminster 's stance is that ruk would be the continuing state and iscotland a new ceceding state . 
  the successor state would maintain all the international treaties and obligations and all the national assets . 
  that would also mean and all the debt !, 
  the snp 's position is that both would be successor states and would share the assets and liabilities on a fair and equitable basis - iscotland would assume its share of the uk 's liabilities . 
  only if ruk refused to share the assets ( as they are threatening ) would iscotland refuse to assume a share of the debts . 
  the main asset in question ( other than military equipment ) is the bank of england - issuer of the currency and lender of last resort . 
  by arguing that it would refuse to share the pound ( the bank of england ) westminster has risked triggering the no asset/no debt stance of iscotland . 
  this then gives the market the willies in case ruk can not maintain the servicing and repayment of the 100 % of the uk 's debts it has inherited . 
  by making this pledge it could be argued that the treasury has signaled it will be making a deal on the sharing of the assets and debt . 
  that will only happen if it also willing to share the currency - game , set and match iscotland i think .

  also close by is the site of the [ battle of bannockburn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_bannockburn ) , which will be the subject of commemorations next year , it being the 700th anniversary of the battle . 
  i 'd never be that mean . 
  discrimination being dependent on my monitor rendering the colours accurately and my old , decrepit eyes being able to tell the difference - not a given . 
  sorry , did n't hover over your flag and thought you were irish - they spell it differently , with an `` e '' . 
  you guys really need to get your flag situation sorted out and i need to pay attention . 
   i even know the word for whiskey quite clearly you do n't . 
  no `` e '' unless your talking about that other stuff ... , 
  i view it as similar to schwyzerd\u00fctsch . 
  as long as people are still taught `` standard english '' and are able to read and write it , i see no problem with the use of scots as a spoken language . 
  as a written language it is no longer much in common use , however , much of our cultural heritage is written in scots and so perhaps in encouraging a rediscovery of our heritage we might also encourage a greater use of scots as a spoken language resulting in a greater understanding of it as a written language and thereby a greater use and acceptance of it as a written language too . 
  that is if you think that studying , understanding and celebrating your own culture is of any worth - though there are many fellow scots that would disagree , that 's how we got here in the first place . 
  whether he said it or not i agree with the headline . 
  it is ridiculous that in the 21st century we have to rely on freedom of information requests to obtain information that our government should be supplying openly and willingly as a matter of course . 
  we need much more open government especially with the increase in privatisation of public services . 
  this privatisation is resulting in taxpayers being bound into paying for contracts of which they have no knowledge of the actual contents . 
  these private firms demand confidentiality , usually on the grounds of competitively sensitive information . 
  my attitude is screw them ; if they want to tender for public contracts then it should be a totally open process - they are hardly going to walk away from billions of euros worth of contracts ( especially if such an arrangement was eu wide ) . 
  it should also make any bidding process more competitive and result in savings to the taxpayers . 
  [ tell me about it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/adown.jpg ) . 
  can i just add that once scotland becomes independent you can add berwick-upon-tweed and also , as many of those living south of it seem to be under the impression that it is the border so why not , the land up to hadrian 's wall . 
  ( only kidding ... . sort of ) . 
  it 's just not the same ... when you thought you were the first ... ... but it turns out there were those before you ... . i feel ... . cheated ( sniffs and wipes away tear ) . 
  em , the design had been put out for user feedback , em communications were n't what they are now , er , took longer than we thought ... . bugger . 
  hey limburg ( belgian side ) , we want [ our lion ] ( http://www.theflagshop.co.uk/ekmps/shops/speed/images/scotland-lion-rampant-flag-10-p.gif ) back . 
  i understand your point , however another way of looking at it ( globally , as you say ) is that it would be more efficient for investment in fracking to be directed to the much larger potential in the north of england and for energy investment in scotland to be directed towards the renewables sector . 
  scotland 's peak daily demand is around 5gw yet the estimated potential of renewables approaches 60gw ( though i doubt we 'll ever get near there ) and with additional connectors to europe either being planned or under construction it will be possible to export electricity generated from renewables directly - zero emissions . 
  the shale gas is going nowhere and will be available in the future . 
  we are actually striving for 100 % of our electricity requirements from renewables by 2020 . 
  the rest of the uk will only meet its renewables targets by importing electricity from scotland . 
  so i 'd say we have nothing to apologise for when it comes to co2 emissions . 
  i think you need to delve a little deeper into the polls .
