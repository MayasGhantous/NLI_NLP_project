  also , you might find [ this ] ( http://www.ross.net/notes/loose.shtml ) useful . 
  as to a federal britain - soon - are you serious . 
  there is absolutely no pressure for that in the rest of the uk . 
  it would require a complete dismantling of the constitutional system and a whole new system put in its place . 
  it would require both houses of parliament voting themselves out of existence . 
  all of those troughers voting away their # 300 a day allowances ... yeah , it 's really going to happen soon . 
  heroin/methadone :(, 
  i have no idea whatsoever . 
  could be because of the [ auld alliance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/auld_alliance ) - the worst foreign policy decision scotland ever made imo . 
  just to clarify for anyone who has n't bothered to look - it is a design by the labour party ( unionist ) !, 
  it was nice of them to leave a space for the graffiti though . 
  there are different strands of thinking within the independence movement regarding eu membership . 
  i think most favour continued membership but some do advocate joining efta instead . 
  opinion polls currently show that , as opposed to the rest of the uk , the majority favour continued membership . 
  one of the dangers of a `` no '' vote is that the proposed uk in/out referendum would result in scotland being dragged out of the eu against the wishes of the majority of those living in scotland - another argument in favour of independence . 
  the position of the snp , who currently form the government in holyrood , is that scotland would negotiate its membership in the period between the referendum ( 18/9/14 ) and when we finally split from the uk ( which would be some time in 2016 if all goes to plan ) . 
  so this would be done from within the eu while we are still members - a process dubbed inlargement rather than enlargement . 
  the beauty of independence is that the people of scotland will be able to decide for themselves - much like people living in poland can - it is the normal state of affairs for most nations . 
  here are a couple of articles by a former bbc radio broadcaster derek bateman about what it would be like the day after the referendum - [ yes ] ( http://drderekbateman.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/dateline-september-19-2014-2/ ) written as he sees it - [ no ] ( http://drderekbateman.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/dateline-september-19-2014/ ) - written in the style/parody of simon heffer a particularly splenetic unionist who writes for the daily mail ; a particularly nasty paper often joking refered to as the daily fail or the [ daily heil ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/daily_mail ) . 
  as to laphroig - good choice . 
  please explain . 
  there are many reasons why it would be desirable , some more important than others and each person will have their own various reasons . 
  here are a few - in no particular order . 
  * getting rid of the nukes - forget for the moment that they are an abomination and are illegal , currently the uk 's nuclear arsenal is located 25 miles from george square in the heart of glasgow ( scotland 's most populous area ) . 
  can you imagine the french locating their arsenal 25 miles from the arc de triomphe or the americans locating theirs 25 miles from times square ? 
  or what about 25 miles from trafalgar square ? 
  we want rid of them . 
  * mismanagement of resources - few nations are lucky enough to be blessed with a windfall such as north sea oil and gas . 
  norway - a country similar in size and population - had the same luck at the same time and has built up a sovereign wealth fund of us$ 737billion . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_sovereign_wealth_funds ) is a list of various wealth funds from around the world . 
  many governments from countries less wealthy than the uk and therefore with more pressing need to spend revenues derived from their natural resources now , rather than the future , have seen the sense of setting aside some of their revenues for future generations . 
  the uk is absent from that list because westminster has pissed north sea oil and gas revenues against the wall . 
  the north sea will continue to produce for about another 40 years and although the volumes will be lower there is as much value to be taken out as has already been extracted . 
  * getting a government we actually voted for . 
  * it is the only way to protect the gains of devolution . 
  only 6 % of those living in scotland would like to see devolution repealed . 
  most ( 67 % ) would like to see it extended further or to have full independence ( [ link ] ( http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/1021487/ssa12tables.pdf ) - table 4 ) . 
  many believe that if we vote `` no '' we will see holyrood emasculated . 
  * having control over taxation is the only way to make the powers already devolved work properly . 
  although the scottish parliament has control over education and health ( amongst others ) the money available is determined by spending decisions made in westminster for england . 
  so , although the scottish parliament is in favour of free university education , when westminster decided to cut its funding for student tuition fees to zero the amount of money in the block grant relating to student tuition fees was also reduced to zero ( block grant - all our tax revenues go down to london and then we are given pocket money back ) . 
  we have been told that there will be [ no further devolution of taxation powers ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/no-further-tax-powers-for-scotland-says-david-cameron-1-2084365 ) - so independence is the only way forward . 
  these are only a few . 
  or just do [ this ] ( http://www.arcofprosperity.org/scotland-as-a-nordic-country/ ) . 
  not as exciting , but a bit more practical . 
  [ we know ] ( http://michaelgreenwell.wordpress.com/2013/09/14/then-what/ ) - you 'll have to scroll down a bit though . 
  i understand the sentiment , however , the rest of the uk gets the governments it votes for - scottish votes are almost always irrelevant . 
  [ link ] ( http://wingsoverscotland.com/why-labour-doesnt-need-scotland/ ) edit : the point i was trying to make is that ruk does n't need scottish votes to return a non-tory government . 
  independence, 
  forget the colours - it 's the design that 's all wrong . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:beaumontscottishunionflag.png ) is how it should have looked . 
  it was actually in one of the [ links ] ( http://blog.whatscotlandthinks.org/2013/09/how-big-is-the-no-lead-after-all-new-panelbase-and-icm-polls/ ) i gave : -  of course the do n't knows may not necessarily split in the same way as the rest of the population has so far . 
  indeed , both of today 's polls suggest they will not ( as indeed have previous ipsos mori polls ) . 
  when panelbase asked their do n't knows what they would do if they were standing in the polling station now , as many as 59 % said they would vote yes while only 34 % indicated they would vote now . 
  if that is indeed what they were to do then , on my calculations , panelbase 's estimate of the yes vote increases from 44 % to 47 % . 
  however , when icm asked their do n't knows which way they thought they were likely to vote next year , yes were ahead by a more modest 21 % to 19 % , enough only to take their estimate of the yes vote up from 40 % to 41 % . 
  ok , not quite 2:1 - but it did qualify it . 
   close enough for jazz . 
  [ here ] ( http://whatscotlandthinks.org/opinion-polls ) is a link to a whole bunch of polls and [ a couple ] ( http://blog.whatscotlandthinks.org/2013/09/how-big-is-the-no-lead-after-all-new-panelbase-and-icm-polls/ ) of [ analysis pieces ] ( http://blog.whatscotlandthinks.org/2013/09/method-matters-yougov-and-progressive-polls/ ) by prof john curtice . 
  he appears to be the only psephologist in the whole of scotland , is never off the tv , and is regarded by independenistas as being `` slightly biased '' . 
  despite any perceived bias he has at last admitted that there is a problem with the polls ; that this is a referendum , not an election , and none of the polling companies have much of a clue as to how to weight their samples . 
  another point to be aware of is that when the msm report the polls they will often lump those not responding `` yes '' in with the `` no 's '' . 
  polling is actually discovering that the undecided are more likely to vote `` yes '' rather than `` no '' by about 2 to 1 iirc . 
  the independence camp is not that despondent that we are not in the lead at the moment . 
  no one expected to be in the lead at the moment . 
  more important is the trend , how soft the no vote is ( apart from its hardcore base of around 30 % the rest appears to be softening ) , how the `` undecideds '' will split and how certain people are to vote . 
  expect to see people move from `` no '' to `` undecided '' and then to `` yes '' . 
  last night bbc 's flagship current affairs program did a referendum special - which i had to switch off so as not to endanger my health or pc . 
  after watching it this morning ( now suitably strapped down ) i was pleased that even after their incredibly biased segments and moderation the audience ( from the `` independence resistant '' borders ) split 30 to 18 in favour of independence . 
  [ here ] ( http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2013/09/18/land-o-kilts/ ) is a wee article on the program with a link in the first paragraph ( which might not work in cyprus ) . 
  ca n't comment for those south of the rio tweed , however , up here we intend to produce 50 % by 2015 and 100 % by 2020 . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20140313 ) . 
  i like [ this ] ( http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/electricity/data/realtime/demand/ ) one as it shows the internal transfers , as well as the imports , that are required to keep the lights on in the south of england . 
  now you 've gone and made me cry . 
  weak - you 'll have to do better than that . 
  close but not french flares . 
  you 've worked out how to copy and paste then . 
  well done . 
  you 'll be getting a gold star on your exercise book . 
  next - how to use scissors , but only if you behave . 
  sad . 
  you seem to be trying to make a point but ca n't quite seem to explain what it is . 
  oh well , i guess i 'll never know . 
  it will have to remain one of life 's great mysteries like who shot jfk or why people wore french flares . 
   something obvious to do with scotland 's place . 
  do tell . 
  i wont be able to sleep until you do . 
  your point ? 
   shetlands/orkneys , which so far has not appeared over eager at independence at all . 
  your evidence for this - any statistically reliable survey ( 1,000 + respondents ) will do . 
  of that i have no doubt . 
   it 's not their own natural resources . 
  they are the resources of the uk . 
  at present , yes , the natural resources are in the uk 's exclusive economic zone ( eez ) . 
  however , on independence this would change would it not ? 
  there would need to be negotiations ( 1 ) due to the way estuaries on the east coast were tied off and ( 2 ) the boundary between english and scottish waters due to the overlap when you extend out from the northumbrian and buchan coastlines . 
  apart from that , existing international laws do not give england a claim on what would lie in scotland 's eez .

   they where secured by the uk , the british people open them , harvest them no . 
  exploration licenses were sold to international oil companies who used their own money ( some borrowed ) and expertise to explore and develop the oil fields , much of the technology coming from houston which was and still is the main centre for oil technology .
