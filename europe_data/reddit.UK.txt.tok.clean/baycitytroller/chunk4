   and benefit from them . 
  i think you mean `` pissed against the wall '' . 
  i think i hear you mum calling - it must be past your bedtime . 
  now away and have a wee wank , if your old enough . 
   this was begun in 2008 i think gchq has been at this far longer than that and allowing the septics to use the facilities for the very same purposes . 
  i 'm surprised that everyone seems to be surprised . 
   or is brown not a true scot ? 
  g brown is scottish without a doubt . 
  as to `` true scot '' - i would n't go down [ that route ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman ) . 
  i think he self describes as british in any event . 
  anyway , what exactly is your point ? 
  you are aware that he did n't govern the country on his own ? 
   so long as we get the majority of the oil - which we will and how do you intend to deprive a sovereign , independent country of its own natural resources ? 
  pray do tell . 
   please stop . 
  please go fuck yourself . 
  where i do n't have to use too big a crowbar i will try to counter [ project fear ] ( http://wingsoverscotland.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/projectfear.jpg ) by promoting scottish [ independence ] ( https://twitter.com/scotfeminist/status/207163693799186432/photo/1/large ) ( there , fixed that for you ) . 
  in this instance i think the link is relevant ; this has the prospect of becoming a foreign relations disaster for the uk , just as snowden 's revelations are for the usa . 
  so we have hague telling scotland that the rest of the world is in awe of british institutions we have this shitstorm being created by one of these same institutions - just letting r/europe know that they should n't be getting upset about this , our foreign secretary thinks they should be in awe . 
  edit : project fear : from the [ herald ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/one-year-on-will-better-together-change-their-tactics.21402294 )  one of the charges against better together is that it is unremittingly negative , preferring to pose endless questions of the yes side , rather than sell the benefits of the uk . 
    privately , some inside better together even refer to the organisation as ** project fear ** . 
  mcdougall is unrepentant about the tactics . 
  listen , what you johnny foreigner types have to understand is that you should be flattered that britain bothers spying on you at all . 
  the british foreign secretary , william hague , has just been up here in scotland to tell us to stop getting above ourselves by thinking we could run our own affairs and that the rest of the world [ is in awe ] ( http://newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-news/7617-foreigners-qin-aweq-of-britain-claims-hague-as-snp-hit-out-at-latest-anti-independence-speech ) of british institutions ( no laughing at the back ) although i 'm not sure if he meant to include gchq and `` awe '' is n't really the emotion i seem to be detecting . 
  [ just like us in scotland ] ( http://wingsland.podgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/scotchmen.jpg ) you need to learn your place . 
  edit : to add graphics, 
  a toss up between [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuy5m36ss0i ) and [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylj-o06is_c ) ( especially because of the [ combolins ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combolin ) which you can also hear on [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhyonny-ls0 ) ) . 
  for a more combative sound [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgdgprldn8 ) is also good . 
  apologies for the outfits and the grainy footage - they were recorded in the ' 70 's . 
  i note you omit the strata of society that see no need or did not have the educational opportunity to learn a foreign language . 
  as i live in scotland i think your challenge is a tad on the unreasonable side . 
  when you take out those that are too young to have had a chance to learn it yet and the older ones who , i imagine , would n't have had the same chance to learn it as later generations then it is not so unreasonable . 
  not all stratas of society will have seen the need or made the effort at school to learn it . 
  without wishing to stereotype or denigrate those in manual jobs , i doubt there are too many danish scaffies who speak english well enough to hold a conversation . 
  while the european parliament may discuss issues , in the uk at any rate , this is not covered at all by the uk msm . 
  the reason , i assume , is that the parliament is relatively powerless , the main decisions being made by the [ european commission ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_commission ) which is held in contempt by most of the uk msm . 
  the politicians may discuss things but there is no great debate amongst european citizens . 
  as to the overwhelming majority of europeans speaking english ; i think that is a bit of a stretch . 
  from wiki ( not authoritative - but good enough for our purposes )  english is the most commonly spoken foreign language in 19 out of 25 european union countries ( excluding the uk and ireland ) [ 3 ] in the eu25 , working knowledge of english as a foreign language is clearly leading at 38 % , followed by german and french ( at 14 % each ) , russian and spanish ( at 6 % each ) , and italian ( 3 % ) . 
  [ 4 ] `` very good '' knowledge of english is particularly high in malta ( 52 % ) , denmark 44 % , cyprus ( 42 % ) and sweden ( 40 % ) . 
  and the netherlands ( 87 % ) , . 
  working knowledge varies a lot between european countries . 
  it is very high in malta , cyprus and denmark but low in russia , spain ( 12 % ) , hungary ( 14 % ) and slovakia ( 14 % ) . 
  on average in 2012 , 38 % of citizens of the european union ( excluding the united kingdom and ireland ) stated that they have sufficient knowledge of english to have a conversation . 
  [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_language_in_europe ) edit : if the european parliament was in london then things would be different - the msm does n't have time for anything outside of the [ m25 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m25_motorway ) . 
  europe does not have a common language like america ( although i appreciate the growing % of spanish speakers ) or a common media . 
  as a result there are rarely any pan-european debates except on forums such as this . 
  instead you will have separate debates in each country - even on issues concerning more than one country . 
  in scotland , at the moment and for the foreseeable future , the main topic is the independence referendum . 
  other topics are the independence referendum and the independence referendum . 
  edit : did i mention the independence referendum ? 
  it has been fairly shouty so far with the prospect of getting even shoutier - friends may also be lost in the process . 
  when your manufacturing industries have been fucked you really do n't need much power . 
  look at iceland , i do n't think their energy use is just because its a bit chilly up there - they currently have three aluminium smelters and that is planned to almost quadruple . 
  yes . 
  ask a celtic fan . 
  or you could look at all the multi-nationals that have invested in scotland recently ( second only to london for inward investment ) and the major investment plans already announced and come to a completely different conclusion . 
  the referendum is over a year away - the polls are going in the right direction - the bitter together campaign has shot its load and are now showing signs of desperation - already over 50 % of people want decisions on taxation and welfare made in scotland - the latest round of austerity measures kick in today - a positive yes campaign versus a entirely negative no campaign - a no campaign which is gradually having to concede issue by issue that everything they said would be impossible is entirely possible . 
  this is only heading in one direction . 
  really , who is wondering that and why ? 
  the uk trade statistical release ( nearer the foot of the page - or [ here ] ( https://www.uktradeinfo.com/statistics/rts/rts%20releases/rtsq42012.xls ) ) will give you a spreadsheet with a full breakdown for each part of the uk . 
  an independent scotland , with sales to ruk now counting as exports , would have about the same per capita exports as denmark ( about 10th in world rankings ) and when you add in the ukcs we would jump to 3rd . 
  it seems to have escaped most commentators here that the deficit being referred to has nothing to do with the gap between tax revenues and government spending . 
  this is about the uk 's age old problem of the trade deficit - the fact that the uk imports more than it exports . 
  rather the south of england ( mainly ) imports more than it exports . 
  [ graph - trade in goods ] ( https://www.uktradeinfo.com/statistics/rts/pages/default.aspx ) . 
  all i get is four pages with some horizontal lines and no text . 
  i wonder who is going to get the job of reworking all these lists when scotland becomes independent . 
  if you want to rely on a survey with a sample size of 166 , be my guest . 
  i 'll rely on those with at least 1,000 . 
  que ? 
  then where is your evidence ? 
  and `` domestic interests '' do not always mean american jobs . 
  cast your minds back a few years ; the good ol' us of a imposed sanctions on eu industries that led to many companies going bust - in scotland it was textile companies . 
  these sanctions were targeted at a number of industries over the whole of the eu . 
  what was the issue ? 
  bananas . 
  more specifically that the eu allowed the importation of bananas from former colonies of eu member states ( mainly in the caribbean ) at preferable tariffs . 
  number of bananas grown in the us of a - zero . 
  but , chiquita and dole , are two american companies who own latifundia across central and south america and they grow bananas . 
  chiquita used to be called [ the united fruit company ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_fruit_company ) whose actions helped coin the phrase `` banana republic '' . 
  [ dole 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dole_food_company ) founder was the cousin of hawaii 's first president who had been active in the overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy and its annexation to the usa - necessary to avoid us importation tariffs ( and more $ $ $ to the owners of dole ) . 
  so the us government are quite capable of extraordinary measures to help their rich and powerful buddies - especially if there is a c an i and an a involved . 
   i also dispute the fact that you `` speak for scotland '' . 
  i never claimed to . 
  all i did was put into words the actual results from actual elections in scotland - where scotland spoke for itself . 
  as to comparisons ; as i tried to explain you need a representative scottish sample to be able to make the comparison . 
  that is why the scottish public attitudes & opinion monitor is so important as it is one of the few regular surveys that has a large enough scottish sample ( 100 % of 1,003 ) for it to be safely used . 
  if you make the comparison between two surveys carried out by the same company , you at least know the methodology was the same . 
  you are also aware in any difference between the timing of the fieldwork - for which you can make allowances in interpretation . 
  if you make a comparison between two different companies - you have two different methodologies - you just ca n't do it . 
  as i explained to guernican , ipsos mori uses random digit dialing . 
  yougov use panels ( subsets of the same people , survey after survey ) or they are done online ( self-selecting sample ) . 
  you can not make a valid comparison . 
  in the industry yougov are referred to as `` anything you want gov '' - not exactly highly regarded . 
  and just in case you are wondering , i am no ipsos mori shill . 
  i got fired for telling the boss , who i had n't previously met , that if he did n't want to be mistaken for one of the interviewers ( as i had just done ) he should probably dress in a more professional manner . 
  some do take 20 minutes , but this one would probably only take about 5 minutes . 
  there would have been ten background questions i think ; * gender * age * employment ( which will give whether public/private ) * home ownership * do you have kids * post code * party voted for in last holyrood election ( constituency vote ) * do you support independence * national identity * country of birth then the survey questions ; * do you think there should be a referendum on eu membership ? 
  * if there was a referendum now how would you vote ?
