  * if scotland was independent should it be a member ? 
  would n't take long - the only bits that would take some time is the employment question as you may have to do a bit of probing and the identity one where you would probably have to read out the choices . 
  some people um and ah and that can add a minute or two . 
  7-8 minutes tops . 
  some detailed surveys can take well over half an hour to complete - these are usually surveys of named leads where ipsos mori has been given a list by the client and they may have been contacted in writing prior to the fieldwork beginning , allowing them the chance to tell mori not to bother getting in touch . 
  you might only complete three or four of these surveys on a shift if people are n't picking up . 
  polls of this type are normally carried out ( by ipsos mori anyhow ) by random digit dialing ; a computer will dial out randomly and if the telephone is answered is automatically transfered to an interviewer . 
  this does exclude anyone who does not have a landline . 
  however , detailed questions are asked to be able to obtain a `` representative '' sample . 
  the first few cards , in the poll linked to above , show the sort of detail gathered . 
  other pollster do , however , take a panel approach and will ask the same group of people survey to survey . 
  having worked for ipsos mori their methodology will be same irrespective of the poll - that is the point of being professional pollsters . 
  any uk wide poll will have a `` small sample '' for scotland , way below the 1,000 required for it to be meaningful , so the scottish public attitudes & opinion monitor is really one of the few barometers of scottish opinion out there that is of any use . 
  so comparing one ipsos mori poll to another seems pretty robust to me - better than comparing ipsos mori to yougov or any other combination you can think of . 
  as you are the one disputing the validity of my numbers , i suggest you go and do your own leg work and come up with an example that makes your case . 
  as i say , it will be meaningless if the scottish subsample is the usual 100 or 200 . 
   most polls put it at just a few percentages higher than some parts of the rest of the uk . 
  not true on recent polling . 
  in november ipsos mori polling in england showed : - * 42 % wish to remain in the eu * 50 % wish to leave the eu the most recent ipsos mori scottish public attitudes & opinion monitor ( fieldwork 4th to 9th feb ) showed : - * 53 % wish to remain in the eu * 34 % wish to leave the eu additionally , it showed that 61 % supported an independent scotland 's membership of the eu .

   third of britons please leave those of us in scotland out of this . 
  in the 2010 uk general election ukip received 3.1 % of the vote . 
  in scotland it was 0.7 % . 
  [ source ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/default.stm ) [ source ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/region/7.stm ) in the 2011 scottish general election ukip received 0.9 % , in the regional list vote , dwarfed by the all scotland pensioners party who received 1.7 % . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/election2011/region/html/scotland.stm ) they barely register in scotland . 
  the scottish press really do n't like to dwell on moments when labour shoot themselves in the foot - and the scotman losing its page ranking , on google , through being [ very naughty ] ( http://www.mediachimps.co.uk/blog/110-googles-penalises-the-scotsman ) means you are unlikely to find it there unless you get the exact headline . 
  so it 's no wonder you were having difficulties . 
  also i have to admit i got the story a little bit wrong myself . 
  it concerned modern apprenticeships and the 2010/2011 budget negotiations - they asked for more , more was delivered - they still voted against the budget . 
  from [ meeting of the parliament 9 february 2011 ] ( http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/28862.aspx?r=7133&amp;mode=html ) after 16:48  john swinney   apparently , all that i have just announced is not enough for the labour party . 
  that is a really interesting proposition . 
  this is what i offered the labour party . 
  i offered labour a proposition that reflected all -- and more -- of the issues that were raised with me . 
  i offered 6,500 additional modern apprenticeships -- we are getting 25,000 now ; a future jobs fund with 3,000 places , which labour turned its back on ; 2,000 flexible training opportunities that are being delivered ; additional bursaries in the further education sector that are being delivered ; additional funding for urban regeneration companies that is being delivered , mr mcneil ; and additional funding of # 2 million for the freight facilities grant . 
  that was all offered to the labour party , yet , somehow , it is not enough . 
  that represents all and more of what labour asked of me . 
  another example was in westminster when labour failed to support a snp/plaid cymru motion against the 50p tax-rate cut . 
  this would have passed by unnoticed ( the motion would have been defeated anyway ) had it not been for a tweet from willie bain ( labour , glasgow north east ) who confirmed what everyone had suspected for some time - that it is policy for labour to not support any snp proposal whatever its merits - now know as [ the bain principle ] ( http://wingsland.podgamer.com/the-bain-principle/ ) . 
  this extended to scottish labour mp 's voting against a snp motion that stated that an independent scotland would enjoy the same `` special relationship '' with ruk that is currently enjoyed by such countries as canada , australia , new zealand and india . 
  the motion was defeated by 321 votes to 5 . 
  32 scottish mp 's voted against it ; 27 labour , 4 liberal democrats and the one sole conservative mp in scotland . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20544743 ) . 
  one can only wonder what they hope the future relationship will be . 
   also , the president said he 's not going to allow it . 
  i was talking about scottish labour - they have to be seen to be believed . 
  no , not really . 
  in scotland the snp was able to govern from 2007 to 2011 having only secured one more seat than labour ( snp 47 , labour 46 , conservatives 17 , libdems 16 , green 2 , independent 1 ) . 
  they managed to get most of their program through by building a majority on a case by case basis - and i would n't put the labour party 's maturity above that of a six year old - they famously voted against their own budget amendment because the snp had adopted it . 
  but i do see where you are coming from . 
  edit : they were then returned with a majority ( which was not supposed to be possible under the voting system in operation ) in 2011 and can now carry out the parts of their program that was blocked - which is why we are having our referendum on getting the hell out of dodge . 
   so he declared that his party wo n't vote in favor of any government , so pd has no way to obtain the majority it needs . 
  did n't he say his party would vote on an issue by issue basis . 
  would the centre-left not be able to run a minority administration on that basis ? 
  about a quarter of their net exports is down to the importation of mineral oils and their processing into chemicals and related products . 
  edit : they also export electricity to the south of england . 
  [ the figures ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_net_exports ) also shows just how shafted the uk is - especially if scotland leaves and the eu restricts trades in the euro to within the euro zone ( shafting the city ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?vw=t&amp;dm=slen&amp;pa=70017eng&amp;d1=a&amp;d2=0-2&amp;d3=0&amp;d4=%28l-14%29,%28l-15%29,%28l-2%29-l&amp;hd=130301-0007&amp;la=en&amp;hdr=g3&amp;stb=g1,t ) is the dutch centraal bureau voor de statistiek site which give you the balance of trade for various categories of goods ( services not included ) . 
  you 'll have to change the selection - easy to do - to add the other sitc categories as it only comes up with the total , food and live animals and beverages and tobacco . 
  have fun . 
  without wishing to diminish poland 's achievement here , surely we should be looking at [ per capita exports ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_exports_per_capita ) . 
  that puts poland 46th in world rankings with $ 3,500 ( 2009 ) . 
  to re-work your list : - * 4th netherlands $ 32,817 ( 2011 ) * 7th belgium $ 23,485 ( 2009 ) * 16th germany $ 14,169 ( 2009 ) * 29th france $ 7,200 ( 2009 ) * 32nd italy $ 6,825 ( 2009 ) * 36th uk $ 5,608 ( 2009 ) * 41st spain $ 4,750 ( 2009 ) * 46th poland $ 3,500 ( 2009 ) not included in the list are norway , ireland , switzerland , iceland , denmark , slovenia , austria and slovakia , all ranking above germany in per capita terms . 
  an independent scotland would rank 11th ( $ 18,993 - 2009 ) without adding in its share of the ukcs which would take it to 3rd on $ 43,492 per capita ( 2010 estimate ) . 
  strong exports are great , however if they are matched by equally strong imports it leaves you kind of [ fucked ] ( https://www.uktradeinfo.com/statistics/rts/pages/default.aspx ) . 
  whiskey might very well be ... ... . whisky , on the other hand , is the nectar of the gods . 
  you could also have [ dark lochnagar ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuy5m36ss0i ) - written by lord byron or [ scotland the brave ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk6lkpfz94s ) as rewritten by the corries . 
   edit : almost forgot - [ the sheriffmuir fight ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlchjtfrrum ), 
  yes , i know it is a myth . 
  that is the point . 
  do you not think the msm in the usofa are as capable as the media in the uk of creating and propagating myths such as the bendy banana one ? 
   eu trade commissioner karel de gucht said . 
    [ . . ] the deal would focus on bringing down remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade , ** and standardise technical regulations , standards and certifications ** . 
  if you are from the usofa you can look forward to articles such as `` eu rules ban bendy bananas '' . 
  what i would also look out for is how this will grow over the years and encompass areas such as procurement by public bodies . 
   as well as most of their refining capacity ?? 
  when they tire of kicking the eu around they always have [ scotland ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cartoon/2013/jan/30/scottish-independence-referendum-question-cartoon?fb=native&amp;commentpage=1 ) ( until 2014 , that is ) . 
  i do n't think spanish fishermen would welcome their government losing them scotland 's fishing grounds should we end up being excluded . 
  i think the controversy might be that a member of a foreign government has felt sufficiently misrepresented by bbc scotland that she has thought it necessary to write a letter to nicola sturgeon to set out her position in a way that can not be misrepresented . 
  also , just to clarify she is not agreeing with barroso . 
  interestingly there is no link to the data so we have to take simon johnson 's word for it . 
  perhaps the data might show a more nuanced picture ? 
  perhaps there might be other bits of information that mr johnson has n't deemed worthy of sharing ? 
  well [ here ] ( http://www.scotcen.org.uk/media/1021487/ssa12tables.pdf ) are the question cards for 1999 to 2012 ( pdf alert ) . 
  the first problem for mr johnson is that the referendum will be a straight yes/no instead of being faced with the five options that are on card 1 . 
  the huge 50 % for `` scotland should remain part of the uk , with its own elected parliament which has some taxation powers '' encompasses those in favour of the status quo and the devo-maxers . 
  now those that favoured devo-max have had that option denied them ( by agent cameron ) . 
  it is a huge , and i would say cavalier , assumption to include this group in the 72 % against - as mr johnson does . 
  when you ask slightly different questions you get a different picture . 
  when asked which institution ought to make the important decisions for scotland about welfare , the answers were ; holyrood 64 % , westminster 19 % . 
  for taxation the answer was 56 % holyrood and 36 % westminster . 
  [ card 3 ] when asked which institution has the most influence on the way scotland is run the response was ; holyrood 34 % , westminster 41 % , local councils 10 % , the eu 6 % . 
  when asked which institution ** should ** have the most influence on the way scotland is run the response was ; holyrood 63 % , westminster 24 % , local councils 8 % , the eu 1 % . 
  [ cards 5 & 6 ] when asked who should make government decision for scotland the answers was ( i 've summarised the headings ) ; the scottish parliament 35 % , devo-max 32 % , status quo 24 % , westminster ( devolution scrapped ) 6 % . 
  [ card 4 ] so essentially the survey shows scots to be in favour of independence as long as its not called independence . 
  of course devo-max is not on the table , so we have `` yes '' on 35 % and `` no '' on 30 % ( 24 + 6 ) with the 32 % devo-maxers out there to be won over to either side . 
  this , combined with agent cameron 's magnificent efforts , should be a source of worry , rather than joy , for the unionists . 
  sorry if you thought i was having a go at you - your post did not come across as being anti-semitic to me . 
  maybe i should have expanded my last sentence ; i was thinking about protestant and catholic vigilante groups in northern ireland as much as any other groups . 
  is [ this ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/justice-on-londons-streets-the-jewish-way-1857591.html ) what you are talking about ? 
  vigilante groups , on their own , are cause for concern - but when they base their membership on belonging to a particular religious group and do n't even bother to to get the blessing of the local police force then i think that it is totally unacceptable .
