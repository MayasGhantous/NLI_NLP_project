  have a look at this [ pdf for vat rates ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/rates/vat_rates_en.pdf ) in the eu . 
  the first category for ` foodstuffs ' show that the uk has only two types , 0 % ( fruit and veg ) and 20 % ( pre-cooked food and sweets , crisps , biscuits etc ) , the rest of the eu does not follow the uk 's progressive lead . 
  fresh food in the uk is tax free . 
  in lithuania its 21 % ... 
  no , religious , ethnic or racial nationalists tend to be conservative or right-wring . 
  people like you actually exist outside of the daily mail and express . 
  til . 
  ireland 's economic interests at the time were best served in a union with england . 
  ask the irish today if they 'd rejoin the union . 
  it 's not my place to suggest this is propaganda to downplay scotland ... but perfidious albion ... 
  the map is wrong . 
  it 's missing lots of pubs in the highlands and islands . 
  i refer to it as `` you got off with it but do n't do it again ! '', 
  keep the seat warm for us . 
  see you in 5-6 years . 
  having it as soon as possible would make it illegitimate . 
  it has to be done with the agreement of the scottish parliament . 
  the independence campaign has to be done democratically in a timeframe which would allow debate . 
  rushing it as soon as possible would not be fair to the electorate . 
  your joke falls flat when you use statistics : country | road deaths per 100,000 people | road deaths per 100,000 vehicles | total road deaths last year -- | -- | -- | -- uk | 2.9 | 5.1 | 1827 germany | 4.3 | 6.8 | 3540 france | 5.1 | 7.6 | 3268 belgium | 6.7 | 10.7 | 746 ** poland ** | 10.3 | 15.8 | 3931, 
  you should listen to her [ speech the day after the brexit vote ] ( https://youtu.be/gnlenf_tiqc?t=1m20s ), 
  throughout the 1970s , the united kingdom was sometimes called the `` sick man of europe '' because of industrial strife and poor economic performance compared to other european countries . 
  it was a bit obvious why joining an economic union was popular . 
  the old age pensioners that voted for brexit were quick to forget that when they look back with their rose tinted glasses, 
  i want may to block any referendum for 20 years too . 
  apart from parliament can not be beholden or bound by previous governments as parliament is sovereign , it would skyrocket the support for independence . 
  this will be news to the pedlars of the ** spain will veto \u2122 ** meme . 
  it 's been put to bed and explained so many times and continuously to the same people ; the constitutional , political and cultural differences . 
  but it 'll be wheeled out during the next indy vote . 
  hell , if/when scotland does get accepted into the eu and becomes a member , you 'll still have those adamant that spain will veto \u2122 . 
  you know , there is n't really . 
  at events that men would wear a kilt , women would usually wear a standard formal dress you 'd find elsewhere in the western world . 
  to make it a bit more traditional , they might wear a tartan sash , shawl or cape thing to go with it . 
  [ there is however a highland dance dress ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tclw_v6vp7g/vwkfe2sqhni/aaaaaaaaaxg/nu02d0b64tkdcff94tqyzyquwsdxujwig/s1600/scotland.jpg ), 
  is this what solidarity is ? 
  the office for national statistics ( ons ) is the executive office of the uk statistics authority , a non-ministerial department which reports directly to the uk parliament . 
  gordon brown , then chancellor of the exchequer , announced on 28 november 2005 , that the government intended to publish plans in early 2006 to legislate to render the ons and the statistics it generates independent of government on a model based on the independence of the monetary policy committee of the bank of england . 
  the irony is n't lost on me . 
  those labour mps should have been ashamed of themselves . 
  nothing stopping parliament from introducing another bill now though . 
  i have a feeling had the bill been defeated , it would have been passed by now anyway . 
  that 's because it would be illegal to do so otherwise under eu law it 's illegal to discriminate against other eu nationals . 
  however residents from the rest of the u.k. are not considered other eu nationals . 
  that 's why there was a whole argument of if scotland gained independence and gained entry into the eu , english residents would be eligible for free tuition in scotland . 
  however with the u.k. leaving the eu that argument does n't work anymore . 
   do n't ask me why scotland gets its own parliament . 
  as someone from a poor area in the middle of england , i 'm still waiting for a scot to explain to me why he gets to go to university for free but i have to pay # 9k a year . 
  because scotland had a home rule movement since before wwi for better representation and to sort out unique issues regarding scotland that were n't being served by westminster . 
  some of the same reasons ireland had a home rule movement too . 
  plans for scottish home rule were shelved due to wwi/wwii and did n't come back onto the agenda until the 1970 's when oil was discovered . 
  in 1979 , a scottish referendum on devolution was passed by voters , however due to mps inserting a clause meaning it needed a majority of the electorate , it effectively meant dead people on the electorial role voted no , and the vote lost . 
  the demand for a parliament to better suit the local issues and scotland finally got one after labour was elected and after a referendum . 
  the north east of england was also offered a devolution settlement but they rejected it at the ballot box . 
  had that been successfully perhaps you 'd have one in middle england too . 
  but the key learning is : set up your own home rule movement and fight for it for over 100 years . 
  as for your question regarding tuition fees . 
  it 's quite simple . 
  because you have n't elected a government to abolish tuition fees for residents , whilst scotland has . 
  if you 're specifically talking about why you can not get free education in scotland , it 's because you are not a resident of scotland . 
  it does n't matter that you 're english . 
  plenty of english people living in scotland get free education as they reside here . 
  the underlying reason is england has 50 million people . 
  scotland has 5 million people . 
  if it let those resident in england to get free tuition , there would be nobody living in scotland going to scottish universities . 
  maybe if the uk government also abolished tuition fees for england , scotland would also do similar . 
  you got downvoted for quoting the article behind a paywall . 
  some people , i swear . 
  i mean , it 's quite possible someone could afford a tesla and subsequently become poor as a result of buying said tesla ... 
  the only person that has brought up the concerns of brexit and northern ireland in parliament was the snp 's westminster leader last week . 
  theresa may completely dismissed the concerns and rambled on without saying anything at all . 
  the uk does not have an official state religion . 
  england 's official state religion is anglicism . 
  but it 's not the uk 's state religion . 
  the church of scotland is recognized as the national church of scotland , but is not a state church, 
  a citizen of a country of which the queen is head of state . 
  yes , you can be a sir if you were n't born there . 
  bill gates , for example has an honorary knighthood . 
  if he became a uk citizen , he would be entitled to use the title . 
  anyone can be knighted , but only commonwealth citizens ( canadian , australian , etc ) can use the title of sir . 
  bill gates , for example was given a knighthood for contributions to charity , but can not use the sir title . 
  my city has some of the highest concentration of churches per capita in the uk yet is the least religious in the uk . 
  the majority of those churches are now converted into clubs and pubs . 
  [ how to divide the uk . 
  map edition . 
  ] ( https://cdn.opendemocracy.net/files/imagecache/article_xlarge/wysiwyg_imageupload/553846/eurefmap.jpg ) areas that voted remain vs. leave, 
  nope . 
  england and wales would have to take their proportion ( the vast majority ) of debt for assets . 
  at least that 's what the uk government and better together were telling scotland that they 'd have to take a proportion of debt if they went independent . 
  desire for a * referendum * has dropped . 
  which is a sensible outlook to have . 
  desire for a referendum after article 50 and the type of deal the uk secures after exiting the eu is another matter . 
  the uk government is trying to bypass parliament by enacting article 50 using royal prerogative . 
  the uk government does n't have the right to overrule the court 's decision . 
  it would be a rather odd situation where parliament votes against having the right to debate and vote on article 50 after a court decides it 's their decision . 
  that 's correct . 
  but doing the first option would cause civil disobedience worse than the poll tax and quite possibly an ira type situation . 
  in no way are the snp right of centre . 
  whilst they are a centralist party predominantly , they have centre left and left policies too . 
  but i am in the uk and i know and care about this , so it 's not true . 
  it 's stories like this that remind me how much more powerful the catalan parliament is compared to the scottish parliament .
