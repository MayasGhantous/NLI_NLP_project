  support kurdistan in its desire to become independant . 
  it 's going to happen anyway , might as well speed up the process and be on good terms . 
  fund , help and build their gas capabilities , also expanding on their pipelines , supporting the ones they 're already building and plan for more . 
  these pipelines cross into turkey , have them cross into greece then into the rest of europe . 
  ukraine is n't in nato , so they have no obligation to do anything . 
  danes also ban foreigners from buying land unless they 've lived there for 5 years , i believe . 
  i think there is a complete ban on foreigners owning danish summer houses too . 
  denmark got a special rule in the maastricht-treaty especially for that !, 
  it 's where pensioners leave to when they retire . 
  spain is to the uk to what florida is to the usa . 
  we 'd just rather not spend trillions getting dogged down in the middle east by joining a country that never bothers to plan past invasion . 
  also having the bonus of not having terrorists blowing up london in retaliation is also a major plus . 
  if that means france takes the place of the uk on foreign military adventures with the us , i 'm all for this . 
  and what about the men that lost their brothers , sons and fathers ? 
  she also said that the greatest victims of war are women , because they lose their sons , fathers and brothers . 
  and not , you know , the men that that actually died . 
  did it go something like this : uk : frogs , reduce your $ 6 billion cap subsidy !, 
  ** france : rosbif , reduce your $ 3.6 billion rebate !, 
   wait , british were unable to discover any elements due to modesty ? 
    explain yourself . 
  the uk has [ discovered ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bj2mpit.jpg ) the most elements than any other country . 
   and / r/danmag [ 2 ] raided / r/inglin [ 3 ] in the spirit of the old viking days . 
  / r/inglin is an american astroturf sub . 
  the sub is even modded by those that run / r/murica . 
   because alex salmond is an enormous cunt . 
  independence is n't about one man or one party . 
  take your head out of your arse . 
  you 'll find bigotry and prejudice in every country on every continent . 
  denmark has farms that are dedicated to just exporting the bacon to the uk . 
  thank you denmark for your bacon . 
  thank you germany for invading and stealing fertile danish land which meant they had to use what land was left , ( ie terrible farming land ) which meant they had to focus on pig farming . 
  danish bacon is best bacon . 
   `` an online black market is operating which protects the users ' anonymity and operates across borders through the use of open source internet browers and payments systems which allow users to remain anonymous . 
  this effectively operates as an online supermarket for illegal goods such as drugs , weapons and pornography i think he 's specifically talking about the tor browser , which is firefox bundled with an anonymous plug-in which uses the onion network , which allows you to be anonymous ( kind of ) , and also surf the ` dark net ' , which can not be found via google or normal ip or web addresses . 
  of course , tor is incredibly useful and valuable to political dissidents . 
  which was it 's indented purpose ( it was initially a u.s navy project ) , ` cracking down ' on it is very short sighted . 
  good luck trying to crack down on open source software . 
  i wish you all the luck , mr. 
  politician . 
  au contraire . 
  we do have something to show for it . 
  the money was used to subsidise london and change the entire economy of the uk . 
  the oil money was used to bankroll thatcher 's reforms , helping her reshape the economy of the uk , one based on industry to one based on tertiary services and finance . 
  without the discovery of north sea oil at that time , her reforms would have destroyed the uk . 
  there 's nothing inherently wrong with that , diversification is incredibly important to a country 's sustainability and health of economy . 
  it 's that she focuses on london . 
  she closed down industry in scotland , wales and northern england , used the newly discovered oil in scotland and pumped the revenue into london and the south east , rather than distributing it across the country in areas that the reforms negatively affected . 
  this set up the decades of decline outside of the south east . 
  it 's ironic that the discovery of such vastly important revenue actually made people poorer closest to it , but those further from it richer . 
  such is life . 
  i have a santander 1-2-3 current account and receive 3 % interest a month on balances of # 20k . 
  costs me # 2 fee but get # 40 back interest a month . 
  i hope to god this is a devolved matter and only affects england and wales . 
  implying your elites are n't involved with tax evasion and fraud ? 
  why would you need proxies when you can just select `` no '' on the activation page ? 
  secessions are rarely legal . 
  i. . i do n't even . 
  is she blaming the train company for not teaching her `` how to board a train '' ? 
  it 's odd . 
  american society is about individuality and self responsibility . 
  it 's why they 're so vehemently against socialised services . 
  yet , when something bad happens to them , it 's always someone else 's fault and should be compensated !, 
  i have a suspicion cameron is n't as anti-eu as he appears to be , but he 's having to appease his backbench mps and trying to keep middle england from swaying towards ukip . 
  the other option is waiting until 2016-2018 when gas from azerbaijan 's massive bp fields are connected to turkey , through to greece and to the european corridor . 
  that 's the title for next time . 
  `` we 're going to cut off your gas and make you starve and freeze , or ... we 'll cut it by 1/3 , and you promise to be our little bitch '' not so much diplomatic carrot and stick as carrot and baseball bat . 
  lets call it for what it is , a bribe . 
  before the toubon law , 80 % of popular music on french radio was american or british . 
  the toubon quota greatly reduced this number , and `` in 2000 the new audiovisual law introduced some flexibility in the french-language requirement , allowing the quota to drop to 35 % in certain cases and changing the quotas of songs by new artists , but the principle that the state should intervene to preserve french heritage to ensure ongoing cultural creation in france remained '' [ source : the french challenge , adapting to globalization : page 49 , trade , culture and identity ], 
  probably because it 's illegal for the show to be written in english in french law france is just a lot more aggressive against english creeping into popular french culture , compared to other european nations . 
  the loubon law for example sets a quota limit on the amount of english that can be sung on french radio . 
   the toubon law ( full name : law 94-665 of 4 august 1994 relating to usage of the french language ) , is a law of the french government mandating the use of the french language in official government publications , in all advertisements , in all workplaces , in commercial contracts , in some other commercial communication contexts , in all government-financed schools , and some other contexts, 
  it 's the title of a self-named [ network ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shitredditsays/wiki/directory ) of 66 subreddits which claim to be of feminist ideology . 
  a lot of people seem to just be reading the headline and jumping to conclusions . 
  it 's just an auto-opt in . 
  you can opt-out by asking . 
  internet settings  adult content  off . 
  or phone bt  request the adult content to be switched off . 
  it 's a mild inconvenience i 'm sure , and probably a bit more for someone still living with their parents or someone that does n't pay the internet bill . 
  my phone 's internet has a porn block too , which took all of 30 seconds to unable by typing in my passport digits . 
   first of [ 1 ] / r/mensrights has been labeled a hate group by the splc , a well-known american civil rights group . 
  wrong . 
  nowhere did that page state that it 's a hate group . 
  indeed , the splc even followed up that by clarifying that they did not claim it was a hate group . 
  see this [ link ] ( http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2012/05/15/intelligence-report-article-provokes-outrage-among-mens-rights-activists/ ) on their website and following quote :  ** it should be mentioned that the splc did not label mras as members of a hate movement ** ; nor did our article claim that the grievances they air on their websites -- false rape accusations , ruinous divorce settlements and the like -- are all without merit . 
  but we did call out specific examples of misogyny and the threat , overt or implicit , of violence . 
  and also , again from the splc :  '' ** it 's false . 
  we wrote about the subreddit mens rights , but we did not list it as a hate group . 
  **  `` in almost all cases , we list hate groups at the end of each calendar year when we publish lists . 
  ** i very much doubt we would ever list the reddit [ r/mensrights ] in question ** -- it 's a diverse group , which certainly does include some misogynists -- but i do n't think that 's [ its basic ] purpose . '', 
  boom . 
  liar . 
  i do n't even post to / r/mensrights , but i will call others out for making things up as for the other stuff . 
  you have mental health issues or are a genuine psychopath because you want to genocide an entire people . 
  i originally had you tagged as srs because you must have posted to the fempire at some stage , but i 'm just going to change it to troll/possible genuinely mental . 
  you 're calling / r/mensrights a hate group , yet you make comments such as :  [ -- ] [ alertaantifa ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1sa63h/muslim_patrol_jailed_for_harassing_couple_holding/cdvok8z ) -16 points 9 days ago ( 11 | 26 )  muslims : scum of the earth . 
   if any group ever needed to be exterminated , it would be the muslims . 
  you claim to be a gay jewish atheist , yet you think muslims should be exterminated . 
   then why does the uk want to keep scotland in ? 
  losing prestige on the world stage .
