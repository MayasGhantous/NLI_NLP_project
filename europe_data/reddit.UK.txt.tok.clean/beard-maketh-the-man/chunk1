actually ... http://www.rses.co.uk/, 
  do n't forget about our most treasured wonder : [ the magic roundabout ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7kzksi1.jpg ), 
  it * nearly * whips the llama 's ass, 
  not really answered , rather just an opinion which some people may or may not disagree with . 
  downvoted for asking a question . 
  have some gold ( by you i mean reddit and the service that allows people like yourself to ask a simple question ) . 
  here you go mate : http://www.specsavers.co.uk/, 
  ** united kingdom ** * [ lots of cyclists got killed within a few days in london ] ( http://cyclelondoncity.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/five-cyclists-three-pedestrians-killed.html ) * [ children in need raises more than ever before ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24941239 ) ( # 31m ) * [ an mi6 spy was not murdered and just fell into a locked bag in his bath , with no finger prints anywhere , `` probably an accident '' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24927078 ) . 
   combining the things we love into one glorious concoction can yield unexpectedly delightful results true . 
  open faced grilled cheese and marmite sandwitch with an fried egg on top . 
  your sandwich makes sense , peanut butter and banana is a classic sandwich , pork sausage lend themselves to being combined with either sweet or savoury . 
  they form like voltron . 
   * cheese , bread and tea ... * i like my cheese sandwiches on a plate and my tea in a cup . 
  not sure i like the idea of putting them all together in a cup :\\, 
  would love a nice clear high resolution shot as a desktop . 
   however , as ars has reported previously , german security experts have [ scoffed ] ( http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/08/crypto-experts-blast-german-e-mail-providers-secure-data-storage-claim/ ) at this marketing ploy . 
  further , using german e-mail services is [ no guarantee ] ( http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/europe-wont-save-you-why-e-mail-is-probably-safer-in-the-us/ ) that someone wo n't go rifling through your messages . 
   while germany certainly has strong data protection and privacy laws , using a german e-mail provider does not necessarily provide users more protection . 
  in fact , it might offer less protection , especially to us-based users , since their message traffic would likely pass through exchanges monitored by the [ nsa 's xkeyscore system ] ( http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/building-a-panopticon-the-evolution-of-the-nsas-xkeyscore/ ) . 
  `` fuck '' as in `` do n't bother with '' reading back that post , i can understand why you 'd now say that . 
  i 've completely failed to put across what i mean . 
  they should n't bother with individual companies , since they 've been forced , by law to comply and keep silent about it . 
  other than lavabit who have thankfully taken a stand . 
  i know . 
  ~ ~ fuck individual companies forced by law to comply ( see : lavabit ) ~ ~ edit to clear up what i mean :  they should n't bother with individual companies , since they 've been forced , by law to comply and keep silent about it . 
  other than lavabit who have thankfully taken a stand . 
  attack terrorist organisations like gchq and nsa . 
  electric autonomous cars ca n't come soon enough . 
  seems the uk simply will not build cycling infrastructure so this may be the best hope . 
  taking driving out of the hands of meatbags . 
  ( most of our drivers are fine , but it 's a numbers game , nearly every ride there 's at least one person that puts my life at risk / does something nasty ), 
  yea , that 'll show him !, 
  a 76 year old that has lived the life of total luxury and wo n't suffer in the slightest soon since he 'll have millions stashed away . 
  we showed him !, 
  gen keith alexander is a terrorist . 
  i do n't fear al-qaeda or any other boogie man . 
  but people like gen keith alexander , the nsa and gchq i really do fear . 
  the amount of power they hold is truly terrifying . 
  it 's safe to ignore most things in all default subreddits . 
  only / r/science has mods . 
  the rest is a shithole . 
  reddit will die because of the default subreddits . 
  i was totally put off by them 2 years ago , i 'm glad i pushed past the shit , because there 's thousands of great people here . 
  sadly outweighed by cunts . 
  all major companies have spies from nsa and gchq ( or whatever you local spook agency is ) working within their ranks . 
  these government agencies have been shown to be committing industrial espionage . 
  i wish cannabis was legal . 
  calories are no joke !, 
  i guess i 'm also forgetting that wine / spirits ! = beer . 
  even in very sedate social situations , 3 x 500ml of beer seems very low . 
  especially given we 're a nation of functioning alcoholics . 
  i do n't believe this map for a second . 
  uk only 74l a year ( 74 / 52 = 1.42 ) , so 3 500ml cans a week ? 
  over the years nearly everyone i 've known has had well over that amount before going out into town , to continue drinking . 
  french , it 's smooth as butter . 
  they should , but they wo n't , because they 're part of the global attack on internet freedom and privacy . 
  well the uk uses more cannabis than you do , but i still ca n't walk into a cafe and buy it . 
  i do n't care who uses it the most . 
  i just want to be able to buy a variety of strains without having to deal with . 
  dealers . 
  plus , like i said , cycling     drugs . 
  i 've seen driving standards in france . 
  well fuck , i thought quick was as french chain . 
  it 's just something i remember from being there as a teenager , along with buying actua soccer and an alice in chains album . 
  `` un [ insert burger ] s ` il vous pla\u00eet '' was just enough to ensure i did n't starve while wondering the streets of paris . 
  how so ? 
  also i should add the world class cycling infrastructure is a major draw for myself . 
  cannabis is a very distant second , but i do enjoy using it . 
  netherlands . 
  i like riding bicycles and smoking cannabis . 
  not sure what it 's like moving to another country with limited skills though . 
  quick burgers, 
  ** doncaster ** : [ thomas crapper ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_crapper )  crapper did not invent the flush toilet . 
  he did , however , do much to increase the popularity of the toilet , and developed some important related inventions , such as the ballcock . 
  he was noted for the quality of his products and received several royal warrants . 
  yes . 
  what interest does the us have with romania ? 
  the recent leak showed us that nsa and gchq are logging and storing everything we do online and on phones . 
  it 's no longer tin foil hat wearing conspiracy theory , but actual fact . 
  so yes , the reason they want id is to monitor , link and control . 
  haha , no apology needed . 
  i 'm basking in my 15 seconds of internet fame !, 
  shit , this means ghcq are definitely watching me now :(, 
  i just got quoted :d http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1gyfyd/undercover_police_spies_unmasked/cap25hy  when some people say `` police state '' , this is what they 're getting at . 
   much more subtle than lots of boots on the street . 
  spies everywhere . 
  i 'd say it 's deflecting focus away from the fact that gchq does the same shit . 
   why not allow five year olds to vote too ? 
  :  if they 're old enough to be taxed , they should have a vote on how that money is used . 
  so let them vote . 
  at least they have an excuse for their ignorance and potential stupidity . 
  what 's the adults excuse after all these years of education and experience ? 
  if they 're old enough to be taxed , they should have a vote on how that money is used . 
  it 's not like adults are n't just as stupid . 
  hence our most popular newspapers are the sun , daily mail and daily mirror . 
  let 's not forget news of the world was up there too . 
  really , i felt like punching the crook who walked off with our money for putting pen to paper . 
   in the london riots the turks defending `` their area '' were praised by the media as brave stand-up citizens , some muslims were also praised in similar terms for protecting a mosque . 
  when whites attempted the same they were labelled right wing racists that were seizing the opportunity `` to spread hatred and division '' . 
  citation needed , my old daily mail reading `` friend '' .
