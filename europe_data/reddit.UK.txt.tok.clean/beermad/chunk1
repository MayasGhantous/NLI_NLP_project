to be fair , the way we 've treated them over the centuries they may have a point . 
  daily mail . 
  enough said . 
  whatever it says is just aimed at stirring up hatred , which is the mail 's stock in trade . 
  sadly , for the vast majority of people here in britain , cheese just means cheddar . 
  you can walk into the cheese isle in any supermarket and there will be more `` different '' cheddars than all the other cheeses put together . 
  and it 's nearly all industrially-manufactured crap . 
  happily though , just like the growth in small high-quality breweries , we 're also seeing a growth in small craft cheese-makers who create distinctive and delicious cheeses in relatively small quantities . 
  here in suffolk we 're lucky to have such a producer at fen farm , on the outskirts of bungay , where they produce the divine [ baron bigod ] ( http://fenfarmdairy.co.uk/cheese/ ) , an unpasteurised , soft cheese that is the most delicious cheese i 've ever tasted ( though i 'll admit to being no cheese expert ) . 
  if you 'd ever heard two blokes from wigan talking to each other you 'd understand exactly what i 'm getting at . 
  very generalised and definitely not ** all ** dialects . 
  two british regions i know fairly well , for example : `` east anglian '' - several distinct dialects , albeit related . 
  suffolk and norfolk are certainly different . 
  and within suffolk there 's a good deal of difference between ( for example ) bury st edmunds , stowmarket , ipswich and lowestoft . 
  and even more so for `` lancashire english '' . 
  almost every sizeable town in lancashire has its own dialect , often mutually unintelligible . 
  someone from rochdale would struggle to understand wigan dialect and even fairly close towns ( such as rochdale , oldham , bury and bolton ) have very distinctive dialects . 
  and even in the `` southern english estuary or kentish '' area , i certainly know of dialect words which are distinct to parts of sussex ( such as twitten - an alleyway - used in the west sussex village where i was born ) . 
  i do n't read many blogs , but that particular one is a `` must read '' for me , just to remind me ** how much ** the right-wing xenophobic press in the uk lies about the eu . 
  i think you 're mistaking me for a religious person . 
  disdain is what that miserable old trout seems to specialise in . 
  some people , especially religious people use `` i 'm offended '' as a way to suppress any speech that does n't agree with their ideology . 
  as far as i 'm concerned they can fuck off . 
  and i do n't care how offended they claim to be . 
  why ? 
  well jesus inspired hitler , so not far off . 
  such is the way of indoctrination ... 
  first time i can remember ever agreeing with ukip . 
  though i ca n't help thinking that their main objection is that it 's through the eu . 
  if the british government was negotiating alone they 'd probably back it . 
  they 're not actually ** legal tender ** . 
  that means you ** have ** to accept it . 
  nothing says you * ca n't * accept those currencies , but you do n't have to . 
  in this context i rather * like * the fact that it was passed with a referendum . 
  that makes for an even bigger kick in the balls for the catholic church . 
  the asda here in ipswich ** is ** in the part of town i would most expect fat people to live in ... 
  i think it 's more that they 're ** perceived ** as being cheap . 
  a healthy diet is * far * cheaper than an unhealthy one , but muck like mcdonald 's is pushed to poor people as if it 's some sort of bargain . 
  my friends and i often joke that we 're not poor enough to be able to afford to live on takeaways . 
  maybe it 's connected with regional variations . 
  for example , 25 years ago i lived in a run-down mill town in the north-west of england and even then the local obesity rate was much higher than it is now here in east anglia . 
  even though people here in ipswich are definitely fatter than they were when i moved here , i bet the population of rochdale has got even fatter in that time , so they 'll be skewing the british results . 
  at last something britain can claim to lead the eu on !, 
  almost makes me proud to be british . 
  to quote [ sellar & yeatman ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066_and_all_that ) , there are two important dates in [ british ] history . 
  one 's 1066 and the other is n't . 
  my respect for the independent has just gone up . 
  interesting , though rather old story ( published in 2010 ) . 
  rather reiterates the fact that russia 's greatest defensive asset has always been general winter . 
  fortunate for the rest of us , given that churchill had the same delusions . 
  i 'd love to share your optimism , but unfortunately it 's not just the murcoch press . 
  non-murdoch gutter rags such as the daily mail and daily express are just as keen to promote made-up `` facts '' about the eu . 
  and even the once `` quality '' telegraph crops up too regularly on the european commission 's [ euromyths ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/ ) blog . 
  the europhobes shout a lot . 
  and lie a lot . 
  and have the gutter press on their side . 
  so i 'm not surprised there are a lot of people who believe all the lies about how the eu wants to eat their babies . 
  i have to admit that i 'm quite scared of the idea of a referendum on an eu exit , because the overwhelming media propaganda is full of lies about the eu , so the british public is certainly not well-informed about the truth behind the issues involved . 
  but i hope this is right - maybe a referendum might end up with a sensible result after all . 
  at 57 years old i 've got absolutely no desire to move home again , but if we pulled out of the eu i have a nagging feeling that a move to the netherlands or belgium could become desirable . 
  unfortunately that useful cellar in ekaterinburg got filled in , but i 'm sure we could work out a solution for those families of in-bred parasites . 
  it 's saying the same about the uk . 
  i 'm guessing that 's because of the large number of poles in the country these days . 
  maybe the same in the netherlands ? 
  because religion always depends on the suppression of any opposing views . 
  fortunately in europe , we no longer allow religions to torture and kill people they disagree with , though many of them would love to return to being able to suppress dissent in the way the catholic inquisition used to in mediaeval times . 
  blasphemy laws are more about protecting religious ideology from scrutiny than protecting deities from being offended . 
  whereas religions are free to make up untrue stories and demand that everybody takes them seriously . 
  not really . 
  your nationality ( or race , sex , sexuality ) is simply innate . 
  your religion is an ideology , not something innate . 
  and all ideologies ( including my own ) are legitimate targets for mockery where they 're ridiculous . 
  as religious ideologies all are . 
  let 's be honest , it does n't matter how well migrants behave , ukip will always lie to make the migrants look as bad as possible . 
   jigadski bloody ` phone keyboard . 
  i ** can ** actually understand the logic behind this . 
  a high percentage of the russian militias fighting in ukraine is made up of fundamentalist orthodox christians ( jigadski ? ), 
  who see it as a `` holy war '' in worryingly similar ways to islamic terrorists . 
  so a few priests to encourage them to get even nastier for `` god '' is probably a good plan for the kremlin . 
  summary : the yanks are determined to screw europeans for the sake of corporate greed . 
   the joke was that the brexit is 100 % against american interests that 's nearly persuaded me in favour of it . 
  whatever 's in america 's interest is 100 % against the interest of the rest of the planet . 
  absolutely not . 
  i 'm in 100 % . 
  yes , the us wants to bring things like european environmental , data protection and consumer protection laws down to the same low standard as those in the us . 
  so us companies can screw the people of europe . 
  independent of governments and courts , maybe . 
  but not independent of big business . 
  tribunals that can look at a law that says `` you 're not allowed to poison your customers '' and conclude that as that law is against the interests of business it 's invalid . 
  tribunals that can over-ride laws intended to protect vital national institutions like the nhs and force the uk government to privatise healthcare . 
  that 's what they 're trying to foist on us . 
  ** in secret ** . 
  well look at what they 're there for . 
  to bomb into submission anybody who gets in the way of uncle sam 's interests . 
  whether or not they actually threaten the us itself . 
  as good a definition of terrorism as i 've seen . 
  absolutely . 
  look into them . 
  they 'll terrify you . 
  well the secrecy certainly stinks .
