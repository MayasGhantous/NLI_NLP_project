  and what 's been leaked about the tribunals that will be set up ( as they have been in other such deals ) to go above governments and courts to rule on what regulations we can have ( be they for environmental , public health or protecting things like the nhs ) is enough to know it 's a bad thing for everything but big business . 
  living here in suffolk , with two huge us terrorist bases , it already feels like the 51st state . 
  or at least , airstrip one . 
  the bloody uk , if i 'm any judge . 
  cameron 's desperate to hand over everything possible in this country to big us business . 
  as ever , the problem is not with the proposed eu legislation , but the lies and distortion the gutter press such as the mail , express , sun , etc. 
  would use it as an excuse to unleash . 
  it always amazes me that euro ~ ~ skeptics ~ ~ phobes claim there 's such a strong case against our eu membership yet all they ever seem to come up with is non-existent , exaggerated or mis-represented things the eu has `` dictated '' to us . 
  if the uk ever elected a government that opposed uncle sam 's interests , it would undoubtedly happen . 
  in the same way that the cia had advanced plans for a coup if harold wilson 's government had turned out to be as independent as they had feared . 
  `` freedom '' in the us context means the freedom to elect any government subservient to the us . 
  and to get the crap bombed out of you if you dare elect anyone else . 
  in a part of the country with too many us terrorist bases around it . 
  which just reinforces my views about americans . 
  can we extend the wall round the whole country please ? 
  utterly horrified !, 
  us foreign policy is quite vile enough as it is already . 
  but that nut-job would make twats like henry kissinger seem almost human . 
  america 's national rifle association has issued a statement to say that even fewer people would have died if all the `` good guys '' in estonia '' had guns . 
  given how much secrecy the whole process is being conducted under to keep those of us who are going to suffer under it in the dark , i very much doubt that . 
  the secret tribunals are the biggest prize for big american companies and they are n't going to give up on that without a big fight . 
  the united kingdom is the union to which you refer . 
  england is one of the constituent countries . 
  the graun is only `` extreme left '' if your personal position is on the far right . 
  certainly it 's left of centre , but then as the political and media gravity in the uk has moved so far to the right these days ( even most of the labour party are more like tories ) , you do n't have to be far to the left to be left of centre . 
  to be fair , they also give plenty of column space to right-wing commentators as well . 
  `` daily mail '' and `` news service '' . 
  now there 's an oxymoron . 
  haverhill . 
  just avoid !, 
  there are bigger shit-holes in england ( i 've lived in rochdale , so i know ) but haverhill is definitely the biggest shit-hole in suffolk ; probably in east anglia . 
  i spend my leisure time cycling round the county of suffolk here in england , photographing pubs . 
  most of the time i 'm in pretty villages or charming small towns . 
  and then there 's haverhill . 
  probably a nice little market town until the middle of the last century when huge , horrible estates were built to accomodate londoners who were surplus to requirements . 
  and instead of photographing [ pretty village pubs ] ( https://m.flickr.com/#/photos/beermad/23126060442/in/set-72157660656293479/ ) i end up with pubs like [ the vixen ] ( https://m.flickr.com/#/photos/beermad/23177798576/in/set-72157659170806643/ ) or [ the suffolk punch ] ( https://m.flickr.com/#/photos/beermad/22577006063/in/set-72157659170806643/ ), 
  if all else fails , you can probably get the bbc radio three stream online . 
  should be able to listen to it now on catch-up . 
  i love this concert . 
  pretty much the only time i listen to radio three here in england , apart from timeshifting the jazz and world music programmes . 
  that said , i do n't know a single other person who listens to it , so i 'm guessing its popularity here is fairly limited . 
  but not so limited that they do n't broadcast it every year ( with the second half apparently playing on the tv as well ) . 
  you must live in [ woodland , north carolina ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-town-rejects-solar-panels-amid-fears-they-suck-up-all-the-energy-from-the-sun-a6771526.html ), 
  because of course , the turkish authorities would ** never ** do anything violent to kurds . 
  here in britain , nothing mainstream worth listening to . 
  just a liad of shit from manufactured boy `` bands '' and dozens of horrible mariah carey soundalike girl singers . 
  i know it 's a sad story , but bloody funny headline . 
  unfortunately , however secular the people are , most european governments seem to be under the control of god-botherers . 
  i do n't even do that . 
  ignore it as much as possible in a country where it 's more fetish than celebration . 
  england : indoctrinated into christianity as a kid but saw through it fairly quickly and have been an atheist for nearly half a century . 
  probably got the idea from david cameron . 
  the quality of these photos is amazing . 
  though i could n't help but be amused by the one of the children on a hillside by the church - i never realised that purple-fringe was a problem a century ago < grin  . 
  ... where british twitter users have the fun of taking the piss out of trump . 
   religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature religion is more usually the ** oppressor ** of the oppressed creature . 
   simply put he he was a lot more of an athiest than a catholic . 
  really ? 
  someone even vaguely atheist would write :  i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the almighty creator : by defending myself against the jew , i am fighting for the work of the lord . 
  ( mein kampf , chapter 2 ) it 's pretty clear from that that murdering jews was very much prompted by his religion . 
   did not believe in organized religion you make it sound like he was an atheist . 
  which he most certainly was not . 
  so why did n't the pope even bother excommunicating hitler for what he was doing ? 
  is mass-murder on an industrial scale an insufficiently serious crime ? 
  or is excommunication just reserved for people who are inconvenient to the church itself , such as people exposing child-abuse ? 
  apparently not capable of even condemning what he was doing . 
  or even excommunicating him to show its disapproval . 
  which is not surprising as the pope at the time was behind the idea of exterminating jews 100 % . 
  i 'd suggest it 's more that the catholic church does n't have the power to organise mass-slaughter these days rather than that it 's evolved . 
  after all , it 's barely 70 years since the catholic church was tacitly supporting the mass-murder of jews that was instigated by one of its members . 
  with one of the most enthusiastic organisers of mass-murder being the catholic archbishop tiso who led the puppet regime in yugoslavia . 
  i think you 'll find that through the centuries they generally have . 
  catholicism has a `` glorious '' history of slaughtering protestants , jews , muslims and anybody else who did n't submit to their nasty ideology . 
  one pope even condemned the entire dutch nation to death for daring to embrace protestantism . 
  precisely my thought . 
  rather like outwardly decent muslims i worked with at the time of the satanic verses fuss who were so indoctrinated that having been told they were offended by the book , told me they 'd happily kill salman rushdie . 
  there may be some differences in various muslims ' ideology , but just like members of every other religious cult they 've been brainwashed . 
  and unfortunately the muslim cult is at roughly the level of civilisation that the christian cult was in the middle ages . 
  when christians were trying to exterminate muslims . 
  great idea . 
  because the one thing that deters people from violence is more violence . 
  at least , in the shit-headed minds of politicians .

  useful . 
  thanks . 
  this sort of thing is the reason i have firefox set to reject all cookies unless i specifically allow them on a site ( with the cookie monster extension to make switching them on or off easy ) . 
  my way of thinking is , if letting you set a cookie benefits me ( for instance so i can log into reddit ) i 'll let you do it . 
  if there 's no benefit to me , you are n't going to set one . 
  just to add - very poor representation of british breweries too . 
  and evidently confused as well - it shows an `` abbot house '' brewery in the vicinity of greene king . 
  there ** is ** no `` abbot house '' brewery , but one of greene king 's beers is called abbot . 
  also shows a `` sole bay '' brewery alongside adnams ; adnams ' brewery is called the sole bay brewery . 
  in fact , of 32 breweries here in suffolk alone , it only shows five !, 
  i 'd say most people think the story was bullshit , but love it no less for all that as an opportunity to take the piss ou of an upper-class twat . 
   i am really scared that justin now hates me proving that she 's every bit as big a shit-for-brains s the tossers attacking her . 
  though going to a bieber gig already proved that . 
  `` when you say , ` i need a wife , ' '' so basically treating women as commodities . 
  nice !, 
  welcome to the real world where what one person loves , other people detest . 
  though of all my music-loving friends i can only think of one person who does n't detest folk music .
