  billiards is played on a snooker table [ with 3 balls ] ( http://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,c_fill/http://www.lynnnews.co.uk/webimage/1.7306892.1459504692!/image/image.jpg ) , it 's pretty rare but still played . 
  pool on the other hand is very popular , just we tend to use [ red and yellow balls ] ( https://cgcookie.com/app/uploads/2012/09/pool-table-3-1024x576.jpg ) rather than stripes and spots . 
  then there is [ bar billiards ] ( http://www.mercuryleisure.co.uk/images/supreme-bar-billiards500.jpg ) which has mushrooms and pins and i have no idea about . 
  if brexit is an issue , the uk , ireland or poland will have a huge interest and lots to contribute . 
  spain to has it 's own separatists issues and is watching the fate of scotland within the eu/uk . 
  it 's his out of context re-arrangements that make me hate him . 
  i know that everything you have said is rational but if you listen to his re-working of bolero , it is so shitty compared to the original it 's practically like digging up ravel and shitting on his corpse . 
  no , his version is not amazing , all of the music has been squashed out of it , the hate is deserved . 
  his arrangement of bolero almost gave me cancer . 
  for what it 's worth [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlfbwo-cbz8 ) is how it should sound . 
  come across as formal ( if the role demands it ) , professional and research the place you are going to work for . 
  there is none of this sending thankyou letters/emails after the interview either . 
  you just sit tight and wait . 
  robin hood in the uk, 
  apologies if it was incorrect . 
  have not driven in germany but in the netherlands , belgium and france in one trip and it was fine . 
  you have an eu passport but that 's irrelevant . 
  once you have convinced the hire company to lend you a car you can drive anywhere . 
  providing your passport is legal and your driving licence and insurance is fine there are no problems . 
  you are looking at it from an incredibly us centric point of view . 
  it might work like that in the us but tends not to here . 
  i never understand why americans come to this sub and try to tell europeans we are wrong because that 's not how it works in the us . 
  it really is ignorant . 
  language does n't exist in isolation , having a different language means different customs , background , family , expectations , lifestyles . 
  that 's cute - london has [ over 100 languages spoken daily ] ( http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/census-data-shows-100-different-languages-spoken-in-almost-every-london-borough-8472483.html ) , in every single borough . 
  for reference there are 32 boroughs each with an average of 250,000 in them . 
  blazing saddles, 
  did your grandparents or parents become naturalised americans ? 
  if they do n't own eu passports your chances are slim to none . 
  i live in london , [ this ] ( http://www.theweek.co.uk/uk-news/52652/britains-most-expensive-house-five-facts-about-%c2%a3250m-mansion ) was on the market at # 250m which is about $ 330m us . 
  i do n't think any footballers can afford the top 1 % of properties in this city . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnihdtb1ggm ), 
  house was built in 1930s , was in a 1000 year old building during my lunch hour . 
  every country has pockets of non native speakers , bizarre offshoot religions and old and new waves of immigration . 
  i am just saying that the us is not sufficiently diverse enough to anything other than middle of the pack diversity wise . 
  have you ever been there ? 
  can you name a country that is n't a country of immigration ? 
  diversity ? 
  by what metric ? 
  how much ribena did you add to how much water ? 
  i would say that a good ratio is about 1:4 or 1:5 depending on preference . 
  the uk might not even be able to invoke article 50 - it looks like it will need to be put to a vote through the house of commons first as it will trigger a change to an existing act of parliament , pm or his representative might not be able to do that without a vote in the house . 
  most of the house does n't want it to happen . 
  this is going to take a very long time indeed . 
  blogs.spectator.co.uk / 2016/06/brexit-political-awakening - young-people, 
  i am a firm remainer but 75 % of young people did n't vote to remain . 
  75 % of the young people who voted , voted to remain , that 's part of the reason that leave won , all the elderly voted , the young did n't . 
  if the eu does that it would have to go all in on financial unity , i.e. 
  one central bank , one tax regime otherwise we would just get a worse version of the greek crisis . 
  that would be too much , i ca n't see any way that could work . 
  you are a fucking idiot . 
  if you use dollars and cents what do you think the constituent part of a pound is ? 
  why do you think you call a cent a penny ? 
  why are you trying to change the subject ? 
  is that the sound of a penny dropping ? 
  why is there a speed limit on your roads , why ca n't i , as a responsible driver , travel as fast as i want to ? 
  it 's a matter for americans , none of my business . 
  you just keep shooting each other . 
  nothing will ever get done about it . 
  it 's legal in the uk but a lot of the activities surrounding it are illegal . 
  you ca n't solicit for sex , own a brothel or be a pimp legally . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_united_kingdom ) might be useful . 
  they really do n't , they are really expensive for what they are and not a patch on a high end burger place that is comparatively priced . 
  brit here , feel very european . 
  travel outside of europe and you instantly feel much more so too . 
  taught nothing about native americans at school , why would we be ? 
  we miss out tons of our own history already as there is n't time to teach it . 
  all my info about them came from westerns initially . 
  i think part of the problem is that a significant portion of the uk population like the idea of a trading bloc as was originally formed but hate the free movement thing . 
  the option to return to what was originally accepted is not on the cards so that is why the exit is polling well . 
  people are willing to give up financial stability to stop free movement . 
  i guess it 's an island thing ? 
  i think the real problem we have in the uk is the lack of informed discussion about the whole thing . 
  i am 80 % sure i will vote to remain but i do n't have any idea why . 
  i am trying to find out the benefits and drawbacks of remaining and all i seem to get it hyperbole from both sides , if we leave it will either be an economic disaster or i will be shitting # 50 notes . 
  same with security , if we leave the muslamics will invade and blow us up , if we remain we ca n't stop them coming over here and blowing us up . 
  i personally would like to be a part of an eu that is a trading bloc rather than a european super state . 
  i think that the euro is screwing , and will continue to screw the mediterranean countries to the benefit of the richer northern europeans countries . 
  obama sticking his nose in and advocating something that his country would never in a million years sign up to really really pissed off a lot of people . 
  when you say lack of vision , what vision are the brexit camp lacking in your opinion ? 
  honesty is always welcome !, 
  no , the right wing ones are usually the most anti-us , there is no way they would leave . 
  as a left wing person i would happily leave the uk but it would n't go to the us . 
  have heard of twain and poe but obviously a lot of context is missing . 
  have you read any george orwell ? 
  it 's in the news but most people seem very pissed off about him sticking his nose into domestic affairs and threatening us . 
  uk here - heard about it . 
  apparently it 's non binding but would cause a huge problem if it was ignored . 
  what unique skill set do you have apart from speaking two languages ? 
  try / r/iwantout as there are fairly onerous visa conditions put on non-eu nationals trying to come and work here . 
  car was right hand drive so its either the uk or ireland ( or malta but the weather is too bad for there ) . 
  there was also a shot with the eiffel tower in the background too so add paris . 
  [ mel brooks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybukqf9p5jg ) was really well known for this . 
  if i was looking to buy a house and the neighbour had a flag i would n't buy the house . 
  that 's my problem i know but that 's the truth . 
  i do n't drink coffee at home , only tea . 
  yorkshire or twinings usually . 
  i do drink coffee but only when out as i do n't have a machine at home . 
  no it is n't , look at a map . 
  i will give you a clue , it 's in the atlantic ...
