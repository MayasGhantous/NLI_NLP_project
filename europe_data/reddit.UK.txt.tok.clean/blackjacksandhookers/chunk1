at the same time though its homicide rate is clearly higher than sweden 's , which has one of the lowest rates in europe . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.socialpolemics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/homicide-rate-europe.jpg ), 
  i did n't downvote you btw, 
  i agree completely . 
  the 1930s and 1940s were a dark period for eastern europe and the ussr . 
  the soviets , the nazis , and the people between them all did terrible things . 
  i wonder when we 'll see weekly posts about incidents where baltic jews were betrayed and murdered by their own countrymen , considering far more baltic jews were killed than balts overall ( both in absolute numbers and in proportion ) . 
  the cruel irony is that jews were * more likely * than non-jewish balts to be deported by the soviets . 
  but that did n't stop the wehrmacht , ss , and local collaborators from painting them all as bolsheviks . 
  this resulted in events such as the liepaja massacres , where countless spectators ( from the kriegsmarine , reich labour service , heer , local latvians ) crowded around to watch . 
  yeah i know , i like polandball comics . 
  but the polandball joke is still a reference to the ethnic cleansing of bosniaks , a process that used methods such as locking up dozens in a house and [ burning them alive ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vi%c5%a1egrad_massacres#pionirska_street_fire_and_the_bikavac_fire ) again i do n't mind the joke much , but i 'm surprised at how so few people mind it . 
  i wonder if any other joke about dark historical events is as accepted as `` remove kebab '' . 
  you see a lot of people calling nazi and 9/11 jokes edgy , but no one ever minds jokes about the rape and slaughter of bosnians . 
  i 'm not complaining myself , but i find it interesting . 
  good point . 
  the `` polish death camps '' narrative is absurd . 
  people will believe that garbage and at the same time regurgitate shit like `` the clean wehrmacht '' . 
  in fact polish-german collaboration was also very low . 
  the blue police itself had many people who worked secretly against the nazis, 
  sadly the holocaust of greek jews was widespread . 
  it should be noted , however , that the level of greek collaboration with the anti-jewish campaign was extremely minimal . 
  the lack of prevalent anti-semitism was commented on by the nazi occupiers . 
  yeah the higher-than-average levels of anti-semitism in italy , spain , and poland stand out . 
  [ greece ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2014/05/pg-2014-05-12-eu-4-04.png ) and [ hungary ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2009/11/2009-communism-45.png ) also have these trends perhaps for poland and hungary this is due to the legacies of communist rule ? 
  though the vast majority of jews played no role in the communist regimes ( indeed they were [ often targeted ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_polish_political_crisis#antisemitic_campaign_and_political_purges ) by them ) , atheistic jews were overrepresented in the polish and hungarian soviet governments . 
   as a russian pow escape from germany : you 'd be executed as a traitor since you did not die for your country in the battle you were captured many thousands of former russian pows were deported to gulags , but they were a minority . 
  the majority did face suspicion but they were not killed or deported . 
  i did n't mean they 'll all have illegal abortions . 
  i 'm saying that i do n't know if this lack of access to birth control will be effective , by using the continuing prevalence of illegal abortions as an example that official restrictions do n't always work . 
   the main reason iran has a low birthrate is the exact same reason as here in the west . 
  educated women get children very late and not that many children , thus leading to a low birthrate . 
  it 's a factor , yes . 
  but btw the trend of falling fertility rates in many countries is outpacing growths for female education , such as pakistan and india . 
  india 's fertility rate has already fallen to 2.5 even though a great deal of women are still not educated ( 34.54 % illiteracy rate for women in 2011 ) . 
  even in yemen , which still has  50 % illiteracy for women , the fr has fallen from 9.22 to 4.21 in 3 decades . 
   was n't this the direct result of adolf hitler dividing the attention of german forces over 3 targets on the eastern front ? 
  it did n't help but even without that it 's near impossible to imagine the wehrmacht adequately resupplying its men and materiel with such long supply lines , limited production capacities , etc etc. 
  wages of destruction is a good book on this topic . 
   the war was lost in the east as we both know , and hitler played a big role in dividing german resources as well as clamping on to stalingrad , which turned out to the major turning point in ww2 . 
  also , the battle for kursk which could have been won was lost because hitler took away vital divisions for von manstein his counterattack . 
  stalingrad was a huge turning point , yes . 
  but with the american entry into the war , the soviets ' remarkable resources and their ability to move around production , and the turning of the tide in north africa , it 's hard to imagine a nazi victory . 
  as for kursk , we could hypothesise about it all day and whether it could ever manage to turn the tide . 
  the red army of 1943 was a different beast to what they were in june 1941, 
  the whole `` it was all hitler 's fault '' is a post-war tale told by the wehrmacht , along with the `` clean wehrmacht '' myth . 
  of course hitler made many terrible decisions , but his generals were n't flawless by any means . 
  and even during the massive eastern victories in 1941 , the wehrmacht was suffering unsustainable casualties . 
  but like i said , abortions are not allowed but are carried out in secret nonetheless . 
  there are a [ ton of reasons ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/world/middleeast/iran-tehran-offers-incentives-to-middle-class-families-to-have-more-children-as-population-declines.html ) why iran 's birthrate is so low, 
   iran 1.3 is their 2014 fertility rate . 
  and illegal abortions are used there . 
  are you accusing me of prejudice for not writing terror in the headline ? 
  i 100 % think these people are terrorists . 
  i copy-pasted my title from this line in the article * german police have arrested four people suspected of plotting to attack muslims and asylum seekers . 
  * because it tells you who the intended targets were, 
  if anyone 's interested i created [ a graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/akva5f1.jpg ) on the website statistics sweden that shows the 8 biggest immigrant-groups in sweden right now , and how much their numbers have risen since 2000 . 
  remember that this bar chart only covers today 's most common immigrant groups ; in total it 's estimated that are now 1.6 million foreign-born people in sweden out of a 9.6 million population . 
  other major foreign-born groups are germans , turks , and danes . 
  so in addition to the 2 terrorists who blew themselves up in paris and the 2 arrested in austria , we also know that a man arrested over the brussels attacks had managed to [ sneak back into europe via greece . 
  ] ( http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/36484/aanslagen-brussel/article/detail/2670210/2016/04/08/de-syriestrijder-uit-zweden-wie-is-osama-krayem.dhtml ) and we have this tunisian man who came to italy by boat last year but has been arresetd for [ allegedly having a role ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32824848 ) in the tunis museum attacks . 
  also , there were those arrests in germany of [ algerian asylum seekers ] ( https://www.yahoo.com/news/suspects-plot-lived-refugee-shelters-german-police-092605348.html?ref=gs ) over a possible imminent attack obviously these cases are small % of the 1 million + migrants who have arrived in europe , but clearly there 's a security risk . 
  info on osama krayem from this [ belgian article ] ( http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/36484/aanslagen-brussel/article/detail/2670210/2016/04/08/de-syriestrijder-uit-zweden-wie-is-osama-krayem.dhtml ) : he grew up in malmo , traveled to syria in 2014 , stayed active on social media , and returned to europe via the greek island of leros thanks to a fake syrian passport . 
  hmm , that last part sounds [ familiar ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3swcex/french_official_one_suicide_bomber_entered_eu_by/cx0xbm7 ), 
  the turkish ambassador to sweden himself made a visit  turkish ambassador kaya turkmen visited the scene of the blast and spoke to members of both the kurdish and the turkish communities . 
  several locals voiced fears that the blast was the result of a hand grenade , but police are still investigating . 
   `` turks and kurds have been friends and lived in peace in sweden and we can be grateful they decided not to be a part of this dirty game , '' turkmen told afp as he surveyed the damage at the cultural centre . 
  some positive signs of the actual locals in the community helping each other out :  his opinion was echoed by groups of men at the nearby anatoliska kurdiska who said that locals would not have attacked each other . 
  kurdish groups also confirmed that kurds from iran , iraq and syria were all present at the [ kurdish ] demonstration , which had nothing to do with the [ kurdish ] centre . 
   indeed , roughly one third of the 25 men seated at the centre were turks . 
  likewise a small group of kurdish men had helped clear away the debris from wednesday 's blast . 
   `` we 've grown up together , over there and here . 
  we try to help each other , '' said haydar bayraktar , the kurdish manager of the centre . 
  yeah , i knew people would be justifiably upset , but let 's not forget that there have been hundreds of random attacks on refugees/migrants in germany alone this year . 
  not to mention other actions , such as the murders of immigrants at a swedish school by some far-right extremist . 
   one of three bombers who detonated himself at the stade de france late friday arrived on the greek island of leros on october 3 among numerous syrian refugees , cnn 's christiane amanpour reported , citing an unnamed french senator who was briefed by the ministry of the interior . 
  the man declared himself to be syrian , said his name was ahmad al mohammad and was , under new procedures set up to help refugees , issued a new emergency passport . 
  from leros , he traveled to macedonia , serbia and then croatia , amanpour reported . 
  ** the fingerprints from the bomber at the stade de france match those taken when the man was issued his emergency passport on leros . 
  ** the two others who detonated themselves at the stadium carried false turkish passports , amanpour reported . 
  so it appears the terrorists were a mix of radicalised french + belgian citizens , and people who entered the eu from outside . 
  they 're [ serbian ] ( http://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/article208465471/milde-strafen-fuer-vergewaltiger.html ) apparently, 
  no , i meant to say compared to the uk and elsewhere in europe . 
  anecdotally it seems like veiling is far more common among british muslims, 
  good points . 
  also , how many french muslim women even wear niqabs/burkas ? 
  i remember it being less than 3000 , and a lot of those were converts . 
  as for the hijab , it is more common than niqabs/burkas but is n't it still less common in france than elsewhere ? 
   the people there want segregation . 
  they do n't want to live in a diverse heterogenic environment . 
  to prevent segregation in europe , you have to force them in an autoritarian way . 
  i do n't think this is true of muslims in western europe . 
  see pg 23 of [ this gallup survey ] ( http://www.olir.it/areetematiche/pagine/documents/news_2150_gallup2009.pdf ) . 
  it shows that in france , uk , and germany , muslims want to live in mixed neighborhoods more than the general populations do ( though by a smaller margin in germany ) . 
  i 'd wager that those mena/african youths clash with each other all the time . 
  it seems like they 'd be overrepresented as both offenders and victims . 
  see the intra-somali gang conflict in gothenburg which was in the headlines because of the death of a young british-somali boy there . 
  or the disproportionate black-on-black gun crime in london, 
  yeah i get that , i 'm just wondering how to reconcile that with the apparently high rate of violent islamist incidents that happen in france . 
  might be because is called for lone wolf attacks during ramadan .
