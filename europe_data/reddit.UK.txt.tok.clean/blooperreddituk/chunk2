  natural selection strikes again ? 
  `` untermensch at it again ffs , cba with their shit right now '' - some germans , maybe, 
  til indeed, 
  i mean as opposed to a ` v ' sound . 
  i did n't say that it was . 
  ` of ' is like ` ov ' , phonetically , whereas ` off ' has a soft ` f ' . 
   fifth largest economy , most famous head of state , lingua franca , progenitor of the modern age , blue water navy , valued currency , nuclear arms , common law tradition , westminster system , financial capital , etc etc. 
  ** i wouldnt expect a belgian to understand that , belgium is a non-country . 
  ** dude, 
  apparently so . 
  he 's used a photo of middle-eastern-looking people because that 's the demographic that is coming into the eu the most , and is likely to cause the most problems in the coming years . 
  it 's an accurate representation of a problem that people have with the eu . 
  he did n't use the word 's ` parasites ' or any other dehumanising language in this poster . 
  i voted to remain but i still just do n't get the outrage ; posters are designed to grab your eye and all posters try to speak to people 's sense of fear or pride or humour or whatever else . 
  [ i 'll just leave this here ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/05/15/a-fascinating-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-racially-tolerant-countries/ ), 
  the uk is probably among the least racist countries on the planet - i 'd sooner be black in the uk than in the states or hungary or anywhere in the middle east . 
  i still do n't really understand the problem with the poster - is n't it a reference to the eu 's handling of the migrant crisis , and therefore an accurate representation of the perceived problem ? 
  you can tell with some words , especially ` of ' sounding like ` off ' , which is a typically polish trait . 
  is that you ? 
   xenophobic and undemocratic sounds a lot like some of the people they do n't want crossing their border . 
   ** left-wingers only deal in absolutes ** https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ogau_dekcki/hqdefault.jpg, 
  cash in hand, 
  i wish the eu was just uk , france , germany , scandinavia and benelux . 
   the industrial revolution happened because england was making hella bank off of colonies , nothing to do with christianity ... also because the western european tradition of scientific endeavour , capitalism and intellectual copyright created incentives for inventions that would change the world more than any other , starting with the agricultural revolution in the 18th century that made feeding people cheaper and easier , freeing people up to do other , less menial work . 
  most of the empire was in fact added after the advent of steam power . 
  how dare they get rid of the occupation , right ? 
  1066 never forget , still fighting for freedom from our norman oppressors . 
  it 's up there with  so-and-so ** just ** did such-and-such ` just ' ? 
  like , within the last minute ? 
  come on . 
  go to sunderland then go to knightsbridge , and you may well think the same thing about the uk - it does n't stop people speaking as if everyone in the uk voted to leave the eu , or are a bit racist , or whatever else . 
  you seriously recon they bribed an entire jury ? 
  the teeth thing is in fact a myth ; research shows time and again that our dental health is , in fact , world class , and better than in the us . 
  i do n't see what rabbits have to do with all this, 
  no need for that sort of commentary on our multiculturalism . 
   european mexicans, 
  those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it - some guy we must keep an eye on these extreme ideologies . 
  i did 8.5 / 2170 then as a % but that works, 
  it 's more like # 8.5 bn , which is 3.9 %, 
  yes , * once in * a liberal society . 
  that says nothing about who you * let in * to your society . 
  are the worries about ghosts backed up by the evidence of numerous polls of their shady views on the world ? 
  trump banned people who had green cards and residency . 
  that is not what i am proposing , so it is not as severe . 
  then there would be no problem and nobody would be worried about it . 
  there is no automatic right of entry into any country . 
  we can filter as we see fit . 
  once you 're here you can believe what you want , but we do n't have to let you in . 
  would fillon or macron be * required * to wear it ? 
  did you reply to the wrong comment ? 
  i just do n't want to help people fleeing from shitty countries that are n't at war . 
  exactly . 
  so where are our left wing options that want to limit non eu immigration ? 
  the problem is that there are no left wing parties that hold this policy . 
  i believe in a welfare state , in the nhs , in progressive views on homosexuality and all that jazz , and in the eu - but not in non eu immigration . 
  i dare say there 's a political black hole here just waiting to be filled . 
  for the uk it 's far more about pakistani immigration because of the commonwealth , which brings all the problems with ghettoisation in places like luton and bradford . 
  my point is really for western europe as a whole though . 
  [ this video explains succinctly the problems with immigration from mena countries . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpjzfgchgle ) they are literally being born faster than we could possibly take them in , so do we want to destabilise and dilute our countries to no great benifit of the mena , or do we want to treat the problem at its root by not invading backwards shitholes and by giving aid to african countries ? 
  if you sink the boats , the boats will stop coming . 
  in the long run fewer people will die making the crossing - so now which is the morally defensible position to make ? 
  it 's like that problem with the train and the junction switch . 
  i 'm glad i 'm not the one to make that call . 
  firstly , people who have papers and are from syria or iraq would be allowed in as refugees . 
  the people who are/were camping at calais ( mostly young men ) would be deported immediately unless they could prove they were refugees . 
   was n't ukip against migration from eu countries too ? 
  the dislike towards eastern european migrants was one of the main talking points during the brexit campaign . 
  that 's my whole point . 
  if i want to limit non eu migration i have to throw the baby out with the bath water and vote for these morons who would also get rid of eu migration , which i do not want to happen . 
  why ca n't they just stop it completely ? 
  if that 's what the people want , and i believe that it probably is , then our politics should reflect that . 
  nobody has a right to enter any country . 
  there should be free movement of european citizens , and no immigration from the mena countries . 
  japan is one of the most socially cohesive countries in the world . 
  they do n't do mass migration from mena countries . 
  my point still stands , no ? 
  why should n't we limit immigration from areas with vastly different views on the world to our own ? 
  why is that such an abhorrent stance to take ? 
  nobody has yet demonstrated to me the apparently enormous value of multiculturalism , and it is taken as axiomatic in all these debates . 
  i live in the uk , where the only party that said it would limit immigration from outside the eu was fucking ukip . 
  why should i have to vote for them ? 
  they 're lunatics . 
  edit : i voted libdem in the end , felt like a complete pussy about it . 
  at least they 're trying to do something to limit the impact of brexit now, 
   what , pray tell , would actually be achieved by abolishing same sex marriage anyway ? 
  nothing , but the point being made was not that being against same sex marriage is a morally defensible position , but that it is by far and away a better position than wanting homosexuals to be murdered for who they are . 
  it is an entirely consistent position to disagree with the islamic treatment of homosexuals whilst also being against gay marriage - even if it 's not a position you would take surely you can see that . 
  shades of grey and all that . 
  the real problem is that there is one rule for men , and another for women . 
  if men had to wear a burka too , i would n't give a monkeys . 
  but they do n't . 
  so i do . 
  the way to combat this is to acknowledge that there are problems , then propose solutions rather than ignoring them or claiming they do n't exist . 
  for example , people are concerned about immigration from outside the eu and specifically from mena countries . 
  the solution is not to say ` there 's no problem here lol get over it ' , it 's to say ` there is a problem , let 's stop immigration from these countries for a few years so we can come up for air and take stock ' . 
  this way you come across as somewhere between sticking your head in the sand and stripping the jews of their citizenship and making them wear yellow stars . 
  it 's really very simple . 
  you are making a false comparison between people who hate gay people and would like to see homosexuality made illegal and people who are a bit behind the times about a religious ceremony ( and who share views with a vast number of europeans anyway ) . 
  a single man .
