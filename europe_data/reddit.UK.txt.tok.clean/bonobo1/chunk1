they 're just lower voting areas . 
  the areas with the lower turnouts always have the lowest turnouts ( general , scottish , euopean ) and vice versa for the highest . 
  not much can be inferred re : yes/no . 
  that 's an interesting thought . 
  i really do n't know enough about the globalhawk 's awacs and take/off landing capabilities to you an answer unfortunately . 
  it seems [ you 're right !, 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/defence/10582903/lockheed-martins-controversial-us-warplane-project-to-boost-more-than-500-british-companies.html ) not sure how i missed this . 
  i guess i assumed the uk did n't have such a significant role after [ rolls royce dropped out ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_electric/rolls-royce_f136 ) . 
  if we only have one carrier we could end up in a bit of a mess if it 's in dock undergoing maintenance when it 's really needed . 
  i 'm not bothered by the conventional powerplant , but the lack of catobar is more problematic . 
  f-35b vs f-35c is arguably a minor issue compared to the inability to launch fixed-wing awacs/aew aircraft , e.g. 
  the e-2 hawkeye . 
  the uk f-35s were or are actually going to be made in the uk ? 
  i assumed they were always going to built in the us by lockheed martin , with bae one of jsf partners . 
  i wonder what these commenters in support of the rebels think now . 
   `` these are not actioned by farmers and peasants ; very good luck to them . '', 
    `` i hope they may get the peace they want , and a gov. 
  that may help the citizens , not killing them . '', 
  it 's called [ enhanced cooperation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enhanced_co-operation ) . 
  not loving does not equal phobia . 
  ale and beer used to mean different things in england , unhopped and hopped respectively . 
  now there is no unhopped beer they essentially mean the same thing . 
  although lager will rarely be called ale , and ` real ale ' now generally refers to unpasteurized , unfiltered beer . 
  [ probably ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=beer ) . 
  english is a germanic language but heavily infiltrated by french/latin . 
  edit : link, 
  ale and beer are really two different things in english . 
  beer is hopped and ale is unhopped . 
  this is n't the current usage , although that north/south britain spit still is n't very true in my experience . 
  now there is no unhopped beer they essentially mean the same thing . 
  although lager will rarely be called ale , and ` real ale ' now generally refers to unpasteurized , unfiltered beer . 
  edit : more info, 
  that may be true , but i do n't think the quote proves that . 
  they would say similar about other eu countries as well . 
  unless you believe the us are not invested in the eu 's success . 
  i think he 's suggesting the green areas on the map correspond well with the blue banana area . 
  huh , i totally meant to ask that question on the [ what ( some ) countries think of each other post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dxgqj/what_some_countries_think_of_each_other/ ) , but you answer my question anyway . 
  thanks !, 
  why does italy have such divisive views on the us and russia compared to others ? 
   how does france like the uk more than germany ? 
  but according to the table , france likes germany ( 85 ) more than england ( 60 ) . 
   `` you should never have expected others to buy a round '' huh , i 've never really experienced that attitude in the uk . 
  refusing to be part of a round is fine . 
  but if you accept a drink as part of a round you 're expected to reciprocate !, 
  recognising your mistake and taking it in stride is not dumb at all . 
  it 's interesting to see the telegraph partially blaming greece 's problems on their lack of post-ww2 welfare state . 
  they may have essentially said : `` you do n't have a token , so fuck your deposit '' * , except in many more words to confuse the non-germans . 
  i 've had that tried on me at the german market before even though no tokens were handed out . 
  edit : did you keep the glass ? 
  is there any chance berlin will catch up with the the western cities within this generation ? 
  it seemed like such a vibrant city on the up when i visited . 
  although noticeably poor in ways , almost inevitably on its way to success . 
  do you think my perception is wrong , can berlin become an economic counterweight to the west in the next few decades ? 
  edit : does ` the speckg\u00fcrtel ' just mean outside of the berlin stadtstaaten or a specific area ? 
  it just seems to translate to ` suburb ' in english . 
  edit2 : ok , i found a link . 
  apparently it means literally means [ ` fat belt ' ] ( http://www.germany.info/vertretung/usa/en/__pr/gic/twig__wow/2012/04-speckg_c3_bcrtel.html ) . 
  yet another amazingly descriptive german word . 
  i 'm glad you posted it , because i did n't see it the first time it was posted . 
  the direct link to the higher quality image is here ( in case you did n't know ) : http://www.bbsr.bund.de/bbsr/de/home/topthemen/downloads/bevoelkerungsentwicklung.jpg;jsessionid=0e177398fe31f72610be4013d684074d.live1042?__blob=publicationfile&amp;v=2[1] ^ ^ thanks ^ ^ / u/carrystone, 
  shame about the capital dots/names , but that 's lots better . 
  thanks !, 
  edit : this ( \\ ^ ) better image was posted 5 days ago . 
  is population decline inevitable , or just a levelling out ? 
  either way , it 's going to be a massive upheaval to deal with and will pretty much require the acceptance of a new economic paradigm . 
  edit : hopefully it will work out for the best though . 
  we 're going to have to deal with stagnant population growth at some point . 
  probably best to get used to it . 
  i wish there was a higher resolution version of this , with smaller or no black dots obscuring the capitals . 
  seems like something that could be easily added to an underground car park for the rich . 
  not if you occasionally want to travel further afield , to remote areas with shitty public transport . 
  or want to travel in the early morning on a whim , when even in the better served areas , public transport is barely running . 
   first , people who have been living in the uk for years , but deported back to the mainland and want to get back . 
  are you making this up as you go along ? 
  i presume this is sarcasm as well ? 
  thanks for the reply . 
   force must be used in a proportional way . 
  to me , that means you can grab someone to prevent them leaving , but not strike them violently unless they do so to you first . 
  is that the way you see it ? 
  no i actually did . 
  we have ` citizens arrest ' laws in the uk . 
  i 'm interested in how this is used in other countries . 
  have you ever seen or heard of someone making a citizens arrest in france who is n't some kind of security guard ? 
  because that 's the situation in the uk . 
  it 's technically legal to perform a citizens arrest , but is it possible in this situation ? 
  i think i was too harsh with my previous reply , so i apologise . 
  i was concentrating on the children referenced in the parent post . 
  you made no reference to children specifically , so the venom in my post was uncalled for . 
  so the wp people consider that chinese are ` whiter ' than the romani ? 
  i mean , i assume they 're discriminating against the romani and not the chinese ? 
  t hey probably consider them higher up in the evolutionary chain or something equally stupid ? 
  i 'm struggling to understand how this video gets stormfront types excited . 
  is it just because there 's non/less-ethnic europeans fighting in a european country . 
  are stormfront types basically accelerationists , hoping for some kind of race war during their life time , 
  it seems you are buying into a much darker ( xenophobic ) philosophy , unless you can explain these strong forces you speak of . 
  so we should treat gypsy children like scum for the choice/criminality of their parents ? 
  sounds like you want to cripple the children to spite their parents . 
  roma gypsies arrived in britain long before irish travellers and it 's not clear which ethnicity is dominant . 
  different sources will tell you different things . 
  unsurprisingly there 's also been more mixing between these groups than with the general population .
