  can we be the engineer still ? 
  it 's cool that they have italian style scottish names . 
  `` donaldi '', 
  i know corazon from a song by the clash, 
  project fear , where have i heard that before, 
  im sceptical of the eu but i 'm not going vote to leave . 
  ` eurosceptic ' seems to mean ` will definitely vote to leave ' in the media, 
  that is n't why we have no trees . 
  we have no trees so that rich english people can come and shoot animals in a barren landscape . 
  the people whinging about being misrepresented were the same people calling the scots `` evil nationalists '' during our referendum . 
  you 'll get no sympathy from me . 
  in scotland we say world the same way russians speaking english say world . 
  edit : wurrulld, 
  that lib dem mp carmichael , if he is really trying to promote shetland independence because they are more `` scandinavian '' then he 's trying to stoke an ethnic division that does n't exist and probably has n't caused much problems since the 1400s, 
  a petition was brought by a lib dem trying to contrive a stick to beat the snp with . 
  go up to the islands and ask them if they feel more scottish or british . 
  edinburgh and orkney are scottish, 
  you overestimate the british sense of family, 
  irish person , `` i had no idea they said ` ri ' in scotland as well ! '', 
  i would n't say irish aristocracy is really relevant any more ... 
  thats unlikely to change lol . 
  probably said that in the 1800s, 
  `` promise you wont resist our tyrannical extension into your land , the banning of your language and ethnic cleansing '' this promise ? 
  ours is well known i think, 
  you just see england taking over scotland and ireland , then england getting pushed back out every couple of minutes, 
  it probably should n't take hints from better together . 
  it was on the winning side but it 's widely considered to have been a terrible campaign, 
  never heard of the battle of camaron ? 
  less agriculture , probably because of the clearances and the fact the land is deliberately kept barren so people can come up from england to shoot the wildlife, 
  `` weak federation '' a confederacy you mean ? 
  never again , lol . 
  i 'm a scottish nationalist and an internationalist . 
  i do n't think scotlands better than anywhere else , but i do n't think it 's any worse either . 
  i like folk music and scottish history as well . 
  i feel nothing at all for britain/uk, 
  highland games and shinty . 
  shinty is quite a bit like your hurling . 
  such as ? 
  senseless rupture . 
  suppose you know a lot about scottish politics , aye ? 
  ridiculous . 
  love eu too, 
  `` norwy '' aww, 
  i 'm the opposite . 
  eu is an actual union of countries whereas the uk is one that pretends it is to scotland ni and wales , and says it 's `` one nation '' to england, 
  that 's a good point i suppose . 
  `` the rant about capitalism is unnecessary because i disagree with it '',

  good comeback, 
  the scotland drawing was a good effort, 
  can we still be scotland, 
  that 's an odd flag, 
  aye because all separatist movements are the same are n't they . 
  a pointy ball, 
  lithuanians are fascinating . 
  i believe they can grow out and retract their teeth at will, 
  scots language is mostly dead , ulster scots is a kid-on language used for political reasons . 
  the fact that they talk about rabbie burns even though he was alive a hundred years after the plantation speaks volumes . 
  economics, 
  scotland would become loads of tiny clan holdings, 
  thats right , brus said to the irish clans that scotland and ireland are ` patria nostre ' - ` our nation ' . 
  that songs a belter by the way, 
  i think it 's originally a persian instrument , or at least that 's the oldest one they 've found . 
  it 's just considered to be a scottish instrument because the scots were the first to use it instead of a trumpet in battle . 
  in europe at least . 
  that paredes song is great . 
  feel the same about ireland . 
  mums irish and i spent a lot of time in kerry growing up . 
  the scenery in the west coast of ireland looks much the same as the west coast of scotland, 
  yeah haha . 
  also makes me laugh to think some of the unionists/loyalists over here that hate the irish do n't know that we inherited a big part of our culture to the gaels , that many of us are gaels and its because of the gaels we have the name scotland itself . 
  aye , its why we have a gaelic language in the first place . 
  also , `` scots '' originally was a broad term for both the people of eire and alba . 
  brian boru called himself the emperor of the scots at one point . 
  there 's a type of bagpipe in scotland exactly like the uileanns, 
  thish man hash the right idea, 
  how fucking good is the new fallout , by the way, 
  has it checked down the back of the couch ? 
  it 's a pan-celtic thing , the word halloween itself is scottish . 
  though all we know about samhain is from irish records . 
  the irish were good at keeping history . 
  a lot of old scottish history comes from ancient records in ulster . 
  not at all . 
  scotland very wisely had a system of universal education in place as far back as the 1500s . 
  for quite a while it had some of the best universities in europe , and a higher literacy rate than both england and france . 
  the `` scotland was a barbaric backwater until we civilized them '' shit is a myth . 
  edinburgh was n't just called ` the athens of the north ' because it has an acropolis you know . 
  the scottish enlightenment happened despite the union , not because of it . 
  otherwise it would be called the british enlightenment . 
  whisky means water as well, 
   i presume he said it in a tounge in cheek kind of way well yeah . 
  it 's just his way of saying he supports an independent scotland and a united ireland, 
  of course not , just saying that historically it was . 
  an irish friend of mine said that he supported the `` roman borders '' . 
  britannia , caledonia and hibernia . 
  good neighbours independent of the other . 
  it used to be called the british isles, 
  there 's no ? 
  would n't that be [ scotchtoberfest ?
