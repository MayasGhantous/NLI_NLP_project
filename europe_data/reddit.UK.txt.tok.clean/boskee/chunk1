oriental review is an independent moscow-based internet journal i lol 'd . 
  sikorski is now the speaker of the parliament , constitutionally one of the highest positions in the polish government . 
  in the event of president 's death , it 's the speaker who takes the office . 
  he 's hardly unemployed , but then again , you 're a well known troll . 
  they invade poland so they can be close to each other !, 
  looks like a troll . 
  funny , i do n't think polish children are taught about war crimes committed by the polish during the war with bolsheviks . 
  a lot of russians died in those concentration camps . 
  not really . 
  weather ! = whether . 
  you need professional help . 
  you have bernie sanders , who seems to be a decent human being, 
  most likely licensing issues, 
   or the bridge over the belt . 
  that map is stupid . 
  should be using either german or polish names , not both . 
  yes, 
  us and its coalition of the willing , mainly european countries, 
  you forgot fascist banderite, 
   ( 1186-1127 ) cause of death : botched teleportation, 
  it means they are alcoholics . 
   conservatives leader kaczynski even said , that if there will be any nato bases in poland , he does n't wish any german troops to be stationed there , lol . 
  proving once again that he 's incompetent and does n't know that german soldiers already serve in bydgoszcz and szczecin, 
  i think / u/honigtopfpegasus laughed at the picture you submitted and not / u/fruity _ pies 's comment . 
  3rd picture in the album , i guess . 
  they still have 17 days left . 
  politicians ( and more importantly their guests ) should only eat ramen noodles !, 
  ok , that 's bad . 
  that would be worrying . 
  are you sure about that ? 
   when you wear a wire ? 
   one way to obtain evidence of the commission of the offense may be monitoring telephone conversations ( wiretap ) . 
  note , however , that this is an exceptional situation , which consent must express the district court . 
   http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/wydarzenia/artykuly/165961,partia-tuska-spuszcza-cba-ze-smyczy.html  `` dgp '' reached the draft amendments to the law on cba  - if such a project gets to parliament , for sure i will give him negative feedback . 
  so has it passed yet ? 
   does what exactly and in what numbers ? 
  accidental text , ignore . 
   granted them even more privileges . 
  can you provide more information ? 
  are you unaware of gchq 's involvement ? 
   from 2011 . 
   and ? 
   before nsa . 
  so the claim that `` polish society is the most spied on '' does n't hold water , because we 've learned a lot about the extent of spying in other european countries since then . 
  ~ ~ the german federal criminal police office ( bka ) also does that . ~ ~  security agency , the military counterintelligence service , the cba does not include any external control . 
  the military counterintelligence service and the cba were both created by the previous government ( law and justice ) and not the one led by tusk . 
  right , but that means the court approved them based on evidence presented by the police , right ? 
   in case you forgot or did n't know , it was polish presidency headed by tusk that was pushing acta back in 2012 . 
  that 's a lie . 
  most eu countries signed acta before the protests . 
  poland was n't pushing anything . 
  you ca n't , it 's bullshit . 
  he speaks german and some english . 
  also :  `` tusk in english : nothing is good enough for europe , including my english , but i will polish my english '', 
  how old are you , 12 ? 
  ah the old `` out of context/unreliable media '' defence . 
  pathetic . 
  dracula is much better than other [ bullshit stereotypes about romania ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwxuojun7s ), 
  yes . 
   russians living in the kaliningrad exclave can visit northern parts of poland without a visa thanks to a local border traffic agreement signed in 2011 . 
  likewise , poles living in the vicinity of the border are allowed to cross the border into kaliningrad . 
   until her execution style killing in her apartment building elevator by contract killers . 
  that 's what i referred to . 
  i 'm sure anna politkovskaya would 've loved to be arrested instead . 
   `` trayvon didnt do nuffink '' i commend your reading comprehension . 
  this is exactly what i wrote . 
  so george zimmerman was a victim of a random , unprovoked attack by a thug ( i heard it 's a trendy new word that racists use ), 
  so why was it goerge zimmerman who stood his ground and not trayvon martin , who was followed by some weird guy ? 
  i do n't think trayvon martin attacked zimmerman for fun . 
  a black youth with skittles sure looks like a robber . 
  kingdom of poland ? 
  i prefer [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozzgajjuqzm ) . 
  poland was n't an empire 1000 years ago . 
  huh ? 
  how is that relevant ? 
  are you obsessed with jews ? 
   here is a short popular ( non-medical ) text of well known czech sexologist radim uzel what were the rules of sterilization and how it become political topic over the time . 
  at the end he adds a personal anecdote , how in 1981 a gypsy woman visited him and asked for sterilization ( and associated money ) . 
  he found she was already ( knowingly ) sterilized before and wanted the money again . 
  hilarious and not racist at all !, 
   good by :-(, 
  ask uefa, 
   it 's even better than most roads in the us ... 
  i 'm not sure if you 're trolling , but most roads in europe are better than those in the us . 
  americans still have free press and tv , russia - not so much . 
   bullshit ... putin keeps getting elected by the russian people . 
  and by large margin :  the 83 % of russians saying they approve of putin 's leadership in late april/early june ties his previous high rating in 2008 when he left office the first time . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/173597/russian-approval-putin-soars-highest-level-years.aspx ), 
  putin has no shame :  russian president vladimir putin has said : `` undoubtedly , the government in whose air space this happened bears responsibility for this terrible tragedy , '' according to a kremlin statement ( russian ) . 
   he also said `` this tragedy would not have happened if there were peace in this land , or in any case , if [ kiev ] had not renewed hostilities in south-eastern ukraine . '', 
   he said that he has given `` instructions to the military so that they have all the necessary help in the investigation of this crime '' , and that he 's requested the government 's civilian agencies to assist as best in can in the investigation . 
  he added that `` no one has the right '' to make conclusions without comprehensive , `` objective information about the incident '' . 
   putin also reiterated his condolences for victims ' families , and observed a moment of silence . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/17/malaysia-airlines-plane-crashes-ukraine-live ), 
  shit happens . 
  what 's disturbing to me is that the people responsible were given medals for their actions . 
  ukrainian intelligence agency published taped conversation between the pro-russian terrorists , in which they discuss the incident . 
  it 's pretty damning and thanks to the name drop ( indonesian student ) will be easy to verify .
