  at least mentally . 
  did you consider poland ? 
  it looks like they 're happy to admit ukrainian students . 
   i 'd like to mention the violent crime rate is also higher in the uk than in the us , despite having very strict gun control . 
  please provide source and make sure that it does n't contain this type of data :  the fbi 's uniform crime reports defines a `` violent crime '' as one of four specific offenses : murder and nonnegligent manslaughter , forcible rape , robbery , and aggravated assault . 
   the british home office , by contrast , has a substantially different definition of violent crime . 
  the british definition includes all `` crimes against the person , '' including simple assaults , all robberies , and all `` sexual offenses , '' as opposed to the fbi , which only counts aggravated assaults and `` forcible rapes . ''  when you look at how this changes the meaning of `` violent crime , '' it becomes clear how misleading it is to compare rates of violent crime in the us and the uk . 
  you 're simply comparing two different sets of crimes . 
  in 2009/10 , for instance ( annual data is from september to september ) , british police recorded 871,712 crimes against persons , 54,509 sexual offenses , and 75,101 robberies in england and wales . 
  based on the 2010 population of 55.6 million , this gives a staggeringly high violent crime rate of 1,797 offenses per 100,00 people . 
   but of the 871,000 crimes against the person , less than half ( 401,000 ) involved any actual injury . 
  the remainder were mostly crimes like simple assault without injury , harassment , `` possession of an article with a blade or point , '' and causing `` public fear , alarm , or distress . '' and of the 54,000 sexual offenses , only a quarter ( 15,000 ) were rapes . 
  this makes it abundantly clear that the naive comparison of crime rates either wildly overstates the amount of violence in the uk or wildly understates it in the us . 
  [ source ] ( http://blog.skepticallibertarian.com/2013/01/12/fact-checking-ben-swann-is-the-uk-really-5-times-more-violent-than-the-us/ ), 
   france , germany , austria , switzerland , canada , and all the nordic countries also have rather high gun ownerhsip per capita , but you do not see these countries labeled as gun toting . 
  - switzerland : 0.457 - finland : 0.453 - sweden : 0.316 - norway : 0.313 - france : 0.312 - canada : 0.308 - austria : 0.304 - germany : 0.303 usa has twice as many guns per capita as switzerland . 
   i think it is funny hearing that debate from a norwegian when it was a norwegian citizen who went on a crazy , pseudo-religious , gun killing spree just a few years ago . 
  you get that kind of killing sprees few times a year . 
  there was 11,419 gun related deaths in the us last year . 
  18 in switzerland . 
  how can you deny that a country with 0.89 guns per resident is not gun toting ? 
  give them a break , they have much more important things to worry about than a damn flag .
