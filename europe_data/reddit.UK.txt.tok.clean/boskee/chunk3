  still , embarrassing . 
  & gt ; yeah and it 's part of the reason why they are so pissed at us . 
  we were fast tracking ua and not them . 
  you are making shit up . 
  no one was fast tracking ukraine . 
  no one guaranteed them imminent membership . 
  hell , it 's not how it works . 
  poland signed its `` association agreement '' in 1991 - 13 years before it became eu member . 
   its is the first and needed step to it . 
  we led them to it on that basis . 
  if you say we never intended to give them membership then there are a bunch of hypocritic pieces of shit who should be preparing their resumee pretty soon because they have no valid reason to stay in power at diplomacy . 
  like i said before , you should n't comment on the things that you do n't understand . 
  association agreement is not a guarantee of a membership . 
  turkey signed the agreement in 1963 and is still not in eu . 
  mate , you should stop writing about things that you do n't understand . 
  - association agreement is not eu membership . 
  - association agreement between eu and ukraine was signed after russia invaded crimea . 
  - only the political part of the association agreement was signed . 
  - eu made it clear that ukraine wo n't become a member anytime soon . 
   `` fact is russia will not invade ukraine '' . 
  `` the russians will never dare '' `` the russians are not coming '' did you forget to mention the authors of these quotes or are you making them up as you go ? 
  no one who knows anything about europe would ever say such thing . 
   ukraine was to be the next eu member . 
  so it says otherwise . 
  you are just making shit up at this point . 
  ukraine was never even considered as the `` next eu member '' . 
  fact is , russia will not invade finland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , hungary or romania . 
   http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/03/16/russian-tv-host-russia-is-the-only-country-with-capability-to-turn-u-s-into-radioactive-ashes/  you might want to start paying attention to what they say and do . 
  so claiming that russia is the only country with capability to turn us into radioactive ashes means that russia will nuke california ? 
  you know that 9/11 hijackers were mostly saudis ? 
   nobody else has been carrying that rifle around . 
  erm , how do you know ? 
  how can you tell it 's the same guy ? 
  why `` anti-terrorist '' ? 
  what those `` activists '' do is pretty much the definition of terrorism . 
  brussels bureaucrats are * literally * hitler . 
  polish does n't have a word for `` years '' . 
  now a polish person will argue with you that they do , namely `` lata '' and that `` rok '' is the singular ( i.e. 
  `` year '' ) . 
  but lata is in fact the plural form of `` summer '' -- `` lato '' . 
  therefore if you want to say `` 3 years ago '' the polish is `` 3 lata temu '' , and if you want to say `` 3 summers ago '' the polish is also `` 3 lata temu '' . 
  as you can see there is no distinction . 
  polish does n't have a word for `` sleet '' . 
  it strikes me as very odd given that polish winters can be very cold and snowy that they do n't have a word for `` sleet '' . 
  instead they call it either `` rain with snow '' or `` snow with rain '' . 
  so when the tv weather presenter says `` there will be rain , sleet and snow tonight '' she has to use the awkward looking phrase `` b\u0119dzie deszcz , deszcz z \u015bniegiem i \u015bnieg wieczorem '' .

   most are just losers [ orly ?

  - our research shows that among those who went abroad for work after joining the european union , 22 percent . 
  have higher education . 
  in poland , a university degree can be proud of 17 percent . 
  people aged 13 and older - she adds . 
  they do n't sound like losers . 
   the net effect is drastic decrease in crime ( according to the oecd , poland is the safest country in europe ) and overall increase in quality of young people here . 
  can you cite research showing correlation between emigration and lower crime rate ? 
  it happened during g\u00f6teborgsvarvet 2008 , and his name is mikael ekvall .

   there was no direct mention of yanukovych but the us has been trying to destabilise his regime for 10 years silly americans , trying to destabilise `` yanukovych 's regime '' 6 years before he became a president . 
  exactly . 
  they do n't want to cooperate and then cry about lack of influence/decisions being made without them . 
  that 's what polish politicians thought , but does n't seem to be the case , really . 
  i believe it 's asian for amelia, 
  i believe it 's asian for amelia, 
  germany is not in eastern europe and i 'm not sure how us is `` babysitting eastern europe '', 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but to me it seems like her main concern was the contract and not the vaccine itself . 
  thanks for the link tho . 
  also , that piece about contaminated vaccine material sent to the czech laboratory was ridiculous . 
  a simple explanation such as `` mistake '' was n't even mentioned , and they interviewed jane burgermeister - [ a well known new world order conspiracy theorist ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loukobhyalk ) . 
   i already knew that you fucking twat , that 's why i 've written that exact same thing in my comment . 
  `` vaccinate against something that almost certainly wo n't kill you if you 're healthy and not extremely young or old ? '', 
  insults aside , you previously said that flu vaccine is useless . 
   i asked you very clearly `` what exactly is nonsense about it '' , and you answered that `` anti-vaccine conspiratard theories have been around for much , much longer '' . 
  i asked you what is nonsense about it , and you told me about the longevity of conspiracy theories . 
  what does one have to do with the other ? 
  ok , i will explain it to you like you 're five : 1 . 
  / u/otac _ jedini said that `` parents refused to vaccinate kids after several affairs when government tried to force injection of drugs of suspicious origin into kids . 
  this all started with `` swine flu '' affair . '', 
  i said it 's nonsense , because anti-vaccine groups started much earlier . 
  you asked me what is so nonsensical about / u/otac _ jedini 's claim . 
  i replied that :  anti-vaccine conspiratard theories have been around for much , much longer . 
  for some reason , it did n't answer your question, 
   how do you expect me to come up with information about something like that ? 
  those are just some things that i remembered because i live through them . 
  do they have to be published in nature to be real ? 
  you claim that `` there were more people that had problems with the adverse effects of the vaccine than people who had problems with the flu itself . '', 
  you either have a source on that or you 're pulling `` facts '' out of your ass . 
   like the ones for flu , swine flu , et cetera . 
  [ flu can be more severe in certain people such as  ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/pages/flu-influenza-vaccine.aspx ) [ anyone over the age of 65 ] ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/pages/flu-influenza-vaccine.aspx ) [ pregnant women ] ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/pages/flu-influenza-vaccine.aspx ) [ children and adults with an underlying health condition ( particularly long-term heart or respiratory disease ) ] ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/pages/flu-influenza-vaccine.aspx ) [ children and adults with weakened immune systems ] ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/pages/flu-influenza-vaccine.aspx ) [ anyone in these risk groups is more likely to develop potentially serious complications of flu , such as pneumonia ( a lung infection ) , so it 's recommended that they have a flu vaccine every year to protect them . 
  ] ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/pages/flu-influenza-vaccine.aspx )  there it is again with that source ... 
  damn right . 
  we can bring up anecdotal evidence , but unless you have hard , statistical evidence i 'd rather trust medical professionals . 
   did i say it was fake ? 
   do you like to put words in my mouth ? 
  then what was the point of that sentence ? 
  to me , it looks like a confirmation bias . 
  you did n't catch swine flu , ergo swine flu vaccines are useless and/or swine flu is n't real . 
   that does n't really answer my question , pal . 
  then perhaps your reading comprehension is poor . 
   what exactly is nonsense about it ?
