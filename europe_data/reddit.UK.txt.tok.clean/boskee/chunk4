  anti-vaccine conspiratard theories have been around for much , much longer . 
   there were more people that had problems with the adverse effects of the vaccine than people who had problems with the flu itself . 
  citation needed  needless to say , neither me , my coworkers , my classmates nor my manager died from swine flu . 
  you also did n't die from hepatitis . 
  does it make it fake ? 
   for me , taking useless vaccines is like self-medication . 
  stupid and pointless . 
  please explain the classification methodology . 
  i would like to know which vaccines are useless . 
   just saying that everybody that opposes your opinion is `` conspiretard '' is ... retarded . 
  and where did i say that ? 
  / u/otac _ jedini mentions `` drugs of suspicious origin '' being injected into kids . 
  i would like to have a source on that . 
   drugs of suspicious origin into kids citation needed and not from an anti-vaccine , conspiratard blog . 
   this all started with `` swine flu '' affair . 
  nonsense . 
  yes , if muslim turks were eating pork, 
  both zirinovski and kaczynski are populists playing on the nanionalistic sentiments . 
  kaczynski does n't believe half of the extremely idiotic things he says . 
  i 'd argue that korwin-mikke actually does . 
  he 's a standard libertardian politician , similiar to the likes of ron paul . 
  more like a mixture between kaczynski and korwin-mikke . 
  [ defence ministers of the visegrad four -- the czech republic , hungary , poland and slovakia -- signed three cooperation agreements in visegrad , north of budapest , on friday . 
  ] ( http://www.politics.hu/20140314/v4-defence-ministers-sign-cooperation-agreements/ ) [ the agreements envisage cooperation in defence planning , drafting a defence concept for 10 to 15 years and setting up a v4-eu battle group by 2016 . 
  ] ( http://www.politics.hu/20140314/v4-defence-ministers-sign-cooperation-agreements/ ), 
   just some random ukrainian nationalists . 
  sad . 
  did you mean ukrainian nationals , not nationalists ? 
  that sounds great . 
  [ poland is preparing for refugees from ukraine ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwiadomosci.onet.pl%2fswiat%2furzad-ds-cudzoziemcow-przygotowuje-sie-na-uchodzcow-z-ukrainy%2f0zjjd ) , so yes , in the event of further russian aggression you will be able to flee to poland . 
   you call self-defense against upa `` murdering ukrainians '' [ that was definitely a self-defense ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paw%c5%82okoma_massacre )  prisoner of war camps `` concentration camps '' call them however you like , but you ca n't justify the fact , [ that out of 85 000 russian prisoners , 20 000 died in those camps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camps_for_russian_prisoners_and_internees_in_poland_ ( 1919 % e2 % 80 % 9324 ) )  invent some bullshit regarding lithuanians [ `` invent '' ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=pl&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fpolonisation.hostei.com%2f )  and belarussians [ `` bullshit '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belarusian_minority_in_poland )  call regaining recently stolen territory ( with polish majority ) `` attack '' [ it was all about `` regaining stolen territory '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia )  and use a false flag my grandparents are polish , lithuanian , ukrainian and austrian . 
  i live in the uk where part of my family settled over 30 years ago . 
  which flag is the most appropriate ? 
  you seem like a product of the one-sided polish education system - exactly what i mocked in my original comment . 
  any criticism of poland is met with hostility , because it seems that you believe that poland never did anything wrong and was oppressed by others . 
  i hate to break it to you , but history is not that simple . 
  poles , lithuanians , belarussians , russians and ukrainians killed each other during the history so stop that victim-narrative and face the fact - poland is also guilty of atrocities . 
  since when does honesty equal self hatred ? 
  shoosh !, 
  poland is the christ of nations , persecuted for centuries , never did anything wrong . 
  it did n't attack czechoslovakia , it never murdered ukrainians , lithuanians or belarussians . 
  it never put russian bolsheviks in concentration camps . 
  amen . 
  i am glad that it does n't show krakow . 
  it 's already the top tourist destination in poland , and almost every promotional video includes it . 
  there are other interesting/beautiful places to visit . 
  it 's called `` mushroom land '' and apparently uses footage from old american nuclear training videos . 
  your country deserves to be nuked for inventing [ easy cheese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/easy_cheese ) . 
  horses do n't drink fuel . 
  they are water tanks . 
  i know it 's a joke , but poland actually has 1063 tanks , compared to 0 owned by the dutch :-), 
  john paul 2  jp2  geppetto, 
  how is it a `` toilet-paper journal '' ? 
  well , it is a compromise and not a total victory , but it would be stupid to reject that deal . 
  yanukovych wo n't back down any further and removing him by force would mean civil war . 
  yanukovych has already lost much of his influence , as ukrainian parliament voted to change the constitution . 
  he was just brutally honest with them . 
  yanukovych agreed to resign ( after the situation calms down ) and it was the best they could get from him . 
  if they did n't agree and insist he steps down immediately , yanukovych would have to pacify the protests and possibly ask for help from his russian friends . 
  edit : quick followup questions from itv :  following the encounter , the foreign minister spoke with itv news ' europe editor james mates :  q : you were overheard warning them of the possibility of martial law if they do n't accept the deal . 
  is that a serious threat do you think ? 
   sikorski : it was a real possibility . 
   q : that the army could have been sent in ? 
   sikorski : to my knowledge the interior troops were being readied . 
   q : they 've stepped back from the brink is what you 're saying ? 
   sikorski : well , as you can see it 's almost miraculous . 
  within minutes of the agreement being signed the riot police are leaving . 
   bad skis a bad workman always blames his tools, 
   dude , you ca n't just vote until the `` right '' result comes out . 
  lisbon treaty anyone ? 
  ;-) sure . 
  i am not talking about another , immediate vote on the issue . 
  i am talking about a vote in a year or two , when switzerland tastes the consequences of its vote . 
  ca n't you organize another vote that will overrule the previous one ? 
  i am only saying how they are seen , not who they really are . 
  huh ? 
  the american polonia , especially that from chicago is seen as poor , uneducated mountaineers from zakopane . 
  they have strong religious believes and tend to vote for far right , nationalistic parties . 
  problem with that is that they have a right to vote in polish elections . 
  it 's the water contaminated by a chemical spill from a factory called , i shit you not , `` freedom industries '' . 
  the last inspection at the factory was carried in 1991 . 
  have a glass of water from west virginia and calm down . 
  i remember people in poland calling roma people romanians . 
  that ignorance really pissed me off . 
  the use of ss is frowned upon ever since ww2 . 
  you are wrong . 
  you can go to/leave uk with identity card . 
  i do . 
  do n't take it the wrong way - i am not saying that american football is bad and boring . 
  i know there are millions of people who know the rules , follow it and enjoy it . 
  and that 's good . 
  personally i do n't see the entertainment , but that 's just me . 
  i also dislike horse racing , baseball and cricket . 
  but i do not think that my preferences are superior . 
  i 'm not sure what you meant by similiar , but if you 're looking for misleading subreddits then there 's / r/nra - news regarding amoebas, 
  to be honest super bowl commercials are usually more entertaining than american football . 
  i really ca n't see anything exciting about that sport . 
  it pissed me off when people celebrated new millennium on new year 's eve 1999/2000 . 
  you forgot to mention one little fact - those tax payers are also polish . 
  also :  recent immigrants to britain are better educated , pay more taxes and draw less state benefits than native britons .
