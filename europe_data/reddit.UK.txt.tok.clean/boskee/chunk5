   the findings , taken from official government data , came in a heavyweight report into the fiscal consequences of immigration to the uk , published on monday by the centre for research and analysis of migration ( cream ) at university college london . 
   the authors of the report concluded that fears that `` benefit tourists '' were coming to the uk with no intention of working were `` disconnected from reality '' . 
  david cameron previously suggested immigration was a `` constant strain '' on public services . 
   according to the report , immigrants who arrived after 1999 in britain , and made up a third of the overall immigrant population in the uk in 2011 , were 45 % less likely to receive state benefits than native brits . 
  they were also 3 % less likely to live in social housing . 
   they were also better educated than native britons . 
  in 2011 , 32 % of those from the european economic area ( eea ) and 43 % of those from outside of the region had a university degree , whereas for native brits it was less than one in five ( 21 % ) . 
   recent immigrants from the european economic area ( eea ) contributed on average 34 % more taxes than they received as transfers , while those from outside of the eea contributed 2 % more . 
   professor christian dustmann , director of cream and co-author of the study , said : `` immigrants who arrived since 2000 have made a very sizeable net fiscal contribution and therefore helped to reduce the fiscal burden on uk-born workers . 
   `` our study also suggests that over the last decade or so , the uk has benefited fiscally from immigrants from eea countries , who have put in considerably more in taxes and contributions than they received in benefits and transfers . 
   `` given this evidence , claims about `` benefit tourism '' by eea immigrants seem to be disconnected from reality . '',

  i think you meant central europeans . 
  [ your logical fallacy is anecdotal ] ( https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal ), 
  so you 're comparing statistics to anecdotal evidence ? 
  and yet more university educated people left poland , than stayed in . 
  i provided you with evidence contradicting your claim that `` are n't emigrants usually uneducated men and women who have a bastard child because they were too stupid to use a condom and now have to wash dishes to make a living ? '', 
  it 's now your turn to prove your claim . 
  that 's probably what the media tells you in poland . 
  it 's far from the truth .

   as for the completed school , it turns out that migrants are generally better educated than their compatriots residing on the vistula . 
  - our research shows that among those who went abroad for work after joining the european union , 22 per cent . 
  have higher education . 
  in poland , a university degree can be proud of 17 percent . 
  people aged 13 and over - he adds . 
  in what sense ? 
  the uneducated roman catholic masses voting for pis would attack the young , educated and above all , civilised emigrants ? 
  far-right nuts with their conspiracy theories are n't really bright . 
  nothing to do with the polish politics . 
  not by far-right idiots , no . 
  i did n't mean to say that poles use hate speech , but that authorities downplay it . 
  just few weeks ago polish prosecutor declined to open an investigation after swastikas were painted on electrical transformers in bialystok . 
  he explained his decision by saying , that `` swastika is a universal sign of happiness and prosperity '' . 
  that may be true in india , but it has a very different meaning in europe . 
  expressions of hatred toward someone on account of that person 's sexual orientation are not forbidden . 
  apart from that , polish authorities tend to ignore hate crimes . 
  i love the word pozer\u00e1m which iirc means `` i look '' in slovak but sounds dangerously close to polish `` po\u017ceram '' ( i devour ) . 
  you 're not doing good at all . 
  start with laws that will penalize hate speech . 
  yes , foreign police officers joined the polish police during euro 2012 just for that reason . 
  it was n't resolved in court , but by the ministry . 
  without immigrants you would be stuck with your disgusting british cuisine . 
   however , since the headline included kaczyinski , who is portrayed in whole german media as an ultra-right-wing-nutjob that 's a very accurate description,

  this + slovakia and czech republic voted against the end of milk quotas or help for farmers hit by drought . 
  `` god is great '' is in no way similar to `` heil hitler '' . 
  you 're the one who does n't understand . 
  poles already decided to join the eurozone in a referendum that was held over 10 years ago . 
   the estimated $ 1.5 billion that disappeared from three moldovan banks  alexander loan ha ha ha , good one . 
   we 've been baptised well , which means poland is catholic enough that your parents thought it would be important to baptise you .

  you 're right - i did n't get much sleep last night ;-), 
  you 're right , of course . 
  it 's early ;-), 
  to be fair he did n't have much say in that . 
  it was mainly franklin roosevelt 's decision . 
  edit : brain fart . 
  i assume you 're talking about razem and not ruch poparcia palikota ? 
  it looks so ... american . 
  i do n't like it . 
  the dutch hussars, 
   `` poland is a great nation , only her people are whores . '', 
   jozef pilsudski , a polish statesman ; chief of state , `` first marshal of poland '' , and de facto dictator of the second polish republic , minister of military affairs, 
  i like that word . 
   imo kiev and ma share the blame with those who shot down the plane . 
  it 's russia and russia only that is responsible for what has happened . 
  suggesting that kiev and ma are even remotely responsible is victim blaming of the lowest level . 
  `` her skirt was too short '', 
  hey !, 
  you wash your dirty mouth . 
  poland is the christ of europe , not romania . 
  no need to be an asshole about it, 
   the us did n't even need someone else to do the job during the 80ies , they just shot down a passenger plane themselves . 
  iran air flight 655 . 
  as if russians never did something similar - [ korean air lines flight 007 ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_007 ), 
   maybe , according to international air protocol that plane should have never flown above an active war-zone . 
  thats like a pedestrian crossing a highway and blaming the car when he gets hit . 
  yeah , that 's not completely accurate : `` until the loss of mh17 , aviation authorities had ordered a no-fly zone over eastern ukraine -- but only up to 32,000 ft , known as flight level 320 . 
  the 777 's crew had asked to fly at 35,000 ft over ukraine , but were assigned 33,000 ft -- the lowest permissible altitude in the area . '',

  blaming malaysians for the crash is like blaming a rape victim . 
   but sanctions would be fair i guess , lets go with the ones the us got for killing 290 civilians with flight 655 ah yes , the famous [ `` and you are lynching negroes '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ), 
   what did russia do to deserve this , something other than what western country 's have never done ? 
  i do n't know . 
  providing weapons that were used to shoot down passenger airplane full of dutch citizens ? 
  well , it 's nice to be able to attend a funeral of another independent journalist or opposition leader murdered in russia .

  kick him out of your house then !, 
  misleading article . 
  those cameras are built and used by the polish border patrol , they wo n't be used by the military . 
  the article linked in this thread mentions the missile deployment in kaliningrad , whereas the original polish articles do n't . 
  it 's just the daily mail stirring shit up . 
  [ they could 've at least mentioned the fact that poland is building those towers along its whole eastern border , which includes russia , belarus and ukraine ] ( https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.dziennikpolski24.pl/artykul/3796893,pogranicznicy-strzega-polskich-granic-z-gory,id,t.html%3fcookie%3d1&amp;usg=alkjrhh40solnydne-49duig20zdj48ovq ) and it already has the same type of towers near its ukrainian border . 
  nothing to do with war , everything to do with smugglers and illegal immigrants . 
  post your photo . 
  i 'd like to judge the way you look . 
  no , he 's not . 
  those comments are disgusting . 
  post your photo .
