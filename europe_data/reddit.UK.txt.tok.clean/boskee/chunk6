  yes , you are . 
  you judge people by their names , which are related to race , not religion . 
   why are n't they releasing the names of the pilots ? 
  is that normal procedure ? 
  [ there you go ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/germanwings-plane-crash-live-updates-5401806 ) . 
  sorry to disappoint you , but it does n't look like they 're muslim . 
   germany 's newspaper bild claims to have obtained their identities and has published their first names and the first letter of the surname . 
   the captain is said to be patrick s. a dad of two with over ten years flying experience . 
   the co-pilot is named as andreas l. a young man from montabaur - a town in the rhineland area . 
   both are said to be german nationals . 
  now take your other racist friends and go fuck yourself . 
  but , but muslims hurr durr, 
  like you said , hypoxia is treacherous and quickly impacts the speed of reaction and intellectual capabilities . 
  it sounds like it was helios scenario and not any explosive decompression . 
  yes , it is . 
  belarus , russia , north korea , china ( ? ), 
  it was n't police . 
  you can buy such uniforms everywhere .

   men are meant to defend the women and children . 
  if you would run away , you 're not a man . 
  you 're right . 
  that 's how they created [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bia%c5%82owie%c5%bca_forest ) . 
  nothing to laugh about . 
  they are not emigrants , but tourists who crossed the border by accident . 
  never heard of `` putler '' ? 
   but the spelling pronunciation, 
  he has every right to state his opinion , given that unlike poles , germans came out clean and admitted all of the horrible things they have done in the past century . 
  how exactly is pis socialist ? 
   centro-left po + psl jesus wept . 
  that 's hilarious . 
   here on the internet . 
  ftfy . 
   if they stick to their promises , they 'll actually push some leftist policies like bigger financial support for families with childrens . 
  not a leftist policy . 
  just like trump, 
  no , i did n't know your point , but `` poland city '' has a different meaning than `` polish city '' . 
  fair enough . 
  i was quoting wikipedia :  polish-speakers call the city brze\u015b\u0107 , historically brze\u015b\u0107 litewski ( literally : `` lithuanian brest '' , in contradistinction to brze\u015b\u0107 kujawski ) before the partitions of poland of the late 18th century . 
  and before the partitions it was also called brze\u015b\u0107 litewski i 'm not sure what your point is, 
  what about the austrians tho ? 
  stay safe / r/floridaman, 
  they will release 2 aaa titles between 2017-2021, 
  that 's completely untrue . 
  polish immigrants in the uk have higher degree than the average polish person living in poland . 
  you already have a mutually beneficial deal .

   blackman was heard telling him : `` there you are . 
  shuffle off this mortal coil , you cunt . 
  it 's nothing you would n't do to us . '', 
   he then turned to comrades and said : `` obviously this does n't go anywhere , fellas . 
  i just broke the geneva convention . '', 
  your point being ? 
  precisely . 
  it wo n't affect the likes of flybe which is headquartered in the uk from flying internal british routes . 
  that 's their bread and butter . 
  exactly , but the likes of ryanair and easyjet make most of their money in continental europe . 
  it 's much more profitable to fly paris to berlin and hundreds of other eu routes , than london to manchester and dozens of other uk ones . 
  guess which one they 'd rather lose . 
  i do n't think there are any train operators that operate between the british cities . 
  in order for ryanair to fly paris to berlin , they 'll have to relocate , yes . 
  however , i always thought that ryanair was an irish company ? 
  not really . 
  he 's still in his first term . 
  poland voted for him back in 2015 . 
  sure , but i 'm not arguing that . 
  i simply stated he was elected by the minority of the population . 
  sure , but that 's beside the point . 
  at the end of the day it 's the minority of the population that elected him . 
  it 's 51.79 % of the 74.13 % who voted . 
  that is minority of the population . 
  that also applies to prussia . 
   i forgot that they are actually going to merge with soundcloud , another swedish company . 
  [ looks like they wo n't merge ] ( https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/08/spotify-soundcloud-deal-dead/ ), 
  no , they 're not binding and there has never been a binding referendum in the uk . 
   trump on vkontakte confirmed . 
  ftfy, 
  not everyone can afford that . 
  except , you know , the prison part . 
  they are punished by having their freedom taken away . 
   except as a punishment for crime this . 
  a ) slavery is legal in the us ( read the 13th amendment ) b ) prisoners in sweden are not ** forced ** to work , whereas the american constitution legalizes ** involuntary servitude ** c ) swedish prisons are n't private d ) the slave labour of the american prisoners is sold to corporations such as microsoft , nintendo , nike , military industry and so on . 
  they 're not simply working internally . 
  how is it weak . 
  when you replace slave labour with prison labour and a legal system targeting the same people you previously enslaved , then you can not claim that your country is great for abolishing slavery . 
  cheers . 
   we literally went to war with ourselves to abolish slavery no , you legalized it and renamed slaves to inmates . 
  should i address the rest of your post ? 
  it 's sold here in the uk . 
  you can buy it in tesco , asda and sainsbury 's .

  pis is allied with the british conservatives . 
   i 'm croatian , it looks weird to me too https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krk, 
  would you prefer malta to be represented by 0.5 mep or the european parliament to grow larger and larger . 
  would you like the french , who only have an mep for every 902,837 people to protest , since they are even more `` opressed '' ? 
   maltese votes are worth over 10x what uk votes are in eu parliament elections .
