  they have spies . 
  they would n't be fighting blind . 
  it would get nasty very quickly , and i honestly do n't think the british public care enough about romania to fight against russia . 
  i agree with this actually . 
  most people ignore this . 
  the u.s. might technically obligated to act under nato agreements . 
  but the public would not be happy about sending people to die because of tiny , irrelevant countries they 've never heard of . 
  the iraq and afghanistan wars were unpopular enough , and they were easy to win and really had very few casualties . 
  now imagine fighting against a modern professional army with good technology and big numbers . 
  russia can shoot down planes . 
  and they can sink ships too . 
  the appetite for that sort of action would be very very small indeed . 
  i did n't see anybody say ` their women ' yet . 
  not so great as they get older , but russian girls in their teens to 30s are very very good looking . 
  oh yeah , and all those classical composers , works of art , space and rocket technology and other shit too . 
  but damn , 6ft tall blue eyes blonde russian girls . 
  hnnnnggg . 
  time to change that law , or start ignoring it then . 
  you are making a fundamental assumption that the eu is one country , like the u.s. 
  but it is n't . 
  however , people in european countries are nowhere as aligned to europe as they are to their home countries . 
  in the u.s. , people are aligned to the country as a whole , not their state . 
  i said `` for their own purposes '' , so what they can/can ' t do is critical to the point i raised . 
  as for the concept of an eu-wide army , with individual countries not bothering to have their own militaries , the concept is laughable . 
  i would hope that the uk never participates in such a thing . 
  it would be yet another initiative where we would contribute far more than we would ever hope to get out of it . 
  the eu is not a country like the usa . 
  so texas could single-handedly declare war on another country ? 
  or invade another us state ? 
  sorry , did you just compare the us ( i.e one country ) to the eu ( many countries ) ?? 
  you 're talking about having both national armies and some sort of federal unified eu army . 
  as far as i know , each us state does n't maintain their own army for their own purposes . 
  and there is also nothing to talk about . 
  it 's noticeably high in countries who have shitty military themselves , who do n't spend money on their defence , and who have rowdy neighbours ( namely russia ... ) . 
  is n't that exactly what you 'd expect ? 
  romania , lithuania etc would be massive beneficiaries from a unified eu army . 
  and funny that support is lowest in the uk - one of the few european countries who does have a fairly competent military . 
  we would have the most to lose , since we would likely contribute the most . 
  your `` solution '' sounds far more complicated than the current situation . 
  if a particularly country can simply `` opt out '' of participation at will , it 's not really a unified military at all . 
  having a second , eu-loyal military sounds like a clusterfuck . 
  where are going to get equipment ? 
  who is going to train them ? 
  will the british taxpayer pay for those british eu-loyal pilots to get new typhoons and get trained in them ? 
  why would n't we just train a british-only-loyal pilot instead ? 
  it makes no sense . 
  im british , and i think the uk would be the same . 
  do you think people would support sending uk troops to fight russia for the sake of estonia or romania , or some other country that most of us could n't find on a map ? 
  we might be `` obligated '' to by nato , but i do n't think it would have public support at all - especially not since war with russia could be pretty fucking deadly . 
  what government actually should do is actively invest outside of the capital cities . 
  paris and london are out of control . 
  i do n't know about france , but in the uk , london is responsible for a massive proportion of the economy . 
  the government should invest in other cities which would create more jobs there and lessen the pressure and expense of the capital by distributing everything a bit more evenly . 
  still a disgustingly pitiful amount for having your loved ones blown out of the sky by the richest country in the world . 
  and more members of the left wing are eurosceptic . 
  owen jones wants to leave . 
  and even caroline lucas is pretty unhappy and demanding eu reforms . 
  i would say that protecting the border and preventing a foreign invasion falls within the scope of the military . 
  is this to keep immigrant boats at bay ? 
   business friendly aka tax haven ? 
  i would n't want to be anybody that the sas are out to get . 
  that article is a total mess . 
  it says that stocks recovered on tuesday . 
  but near the bottom it mentions that stocks fell on tuesday . 
  and the americans and japanese should mind their own business . 
  impossible . 
  individual countries ca n't even `` end austerity '' within their own borders with their own elected governments . 
  the thought that it could be implemented eu-wide is bonkers . 
   moving `` into '' europe proper , with europe having to sit and watch it happen . 
  i honestly do n't see why you think europe would just sit back and watch it happen . 
  of course they would do something about it . 
  no more loans . 
  sanctions . 
  threat of force . 
  force , if necessary . 
  in that order . 
  it 's not like the rest of europe has no negotiating power over greece . 
  oh come on . 
  the eu has enormous `` negotiating '' power over greece . 
  they are basically at our mercy . 
  their credit rating is already destroyed . 
  but any sort of eu sanctions would really kill them . 
  and frankly , if greece really were cozying up with russia , or talking about hosting russian bases , radar etc , yes , i would absolutely support the uk military being used in some capacity . 
  i do n't think greece should get to hold us to ransom and demand more money `` or else '' . 
  they are n't in the position to make demands now . 
  what makes you think that europe would let greece ally with russia ? 
  and that 's how greece would find itself sanctioned , ostracised , maybe even blockaded . 
  a pariah state that everybody would hate . 
  it sucking greece though . 
  could they even afford fuel for their planes ? 
  just to add to this . 
  it 's easier and cheaper to be the counteracting force . 
  russia will only ever be fighting on their doorstep . 
  if there 's any way , it would be in europe and not the us mainland . 
  however , to fight russia , the us would have to take the fight thousands of miles away , which means lots more capabilities are needed . 
  also , it 's quicker and easier to play the defensive , neutralising role . 
  for example : america spends tens of ** billions ** on a fancy stealth plane . 
  russia spends tens of ** millions ** on better radar and air defences . 
  america spends billions on aircraft carriers . 
  russia spends millions on better anti-ship missiles .
