they 're brown . 
  i think you misunderstand the concept of utopia . 
  in a utopia you do n't need to ` improve society ' . 
  my definition , it 's perfect . 
  that 's probably one of the things that stops nordic countries being an actual utopia : in an ideal world , there are no classes . 
  does n't make it any less true . 
  this is a country you 'd make in a paradox game . 
  i 'm pretty sure that there are some who have actual family names . 
  j\u00f3n gnarr and his son frosti gnarr have one , for example . 
  maybe your government could give people a legal icelandic name , like foreigners get in china when their name does n't transcribe . 
   the former mayor of reykjavik , j\u00f3n gnarr , told the guardian that the country 's naming law was `` unfair , stupid , and against creativity '' . 
  j\u00f3n gnarr is a dude . 
  his son , frosty ( frosti ? ), 
  was on doug stranhope 's podcast a little while ago , and they told stories of his visit to iceland , when he and his dad ( the * mayor * ) picked him up at the airport in gorilla masks . 
  girl * and * boy . 
   both she and a sibling , duncan , have `` not been approved '' by the icelanding naming committee, 
  all i hear is  thank you for your service . 
  you do the math . 
  i could care less . 
  i suspect less , because england have sporting successes against germany , but the us do n't ( or they do , but they 're in baseball ), 
  ~ ~ immigrants ! ~ ~ birth rate !, 
  mama , kan ich go and make the doing of kampf ? 
  * nein , mein little strudel , for it is not of kampf you think it . 
  not * necessary * , but it would be nice to differentiate between the supranational organisation and the potential nation . 
  huh . 
  i was sure i saw something like that for france ... 
  what about the bird foetuses ? 
  is that popular ?

  fuck , man . 
  she could use an editor . 
  * shrug * but they are n't a country , and i do n't know if they have a ` one nation , indivisible ' clause , either . 
  greenland left it , so it 's presumably possible . 
  any constitution that says that is bullshit . 
  if they do n't want to be part of a country , why would they obey their rules ? 
  i think most british are bilingual - if not in spoken language then at least in measurements . 
  except fluid ounces . 
  fuck fluid ounces . 
  ` lawrence fishburne is black . ', 
  ` well , have you * compared * him to a dulux colour chart ? ', 
  unless you have the hdi of the ayyubid dynasty , you can not be certain that their quality of life was n't better than today . 
  you realise how stupid that sounds , right ? 
  with a classless system , you have no class . 
  see : australia . 
  also the crown own a lot of land and all the profits go to the british government , in return for a guaranteed salary . 
  i 'm not in favour of the monarchy in principle , but it 's a ` what you gon na do ? ', 
  situation . 
   and half of polands !, 
  how embarrassing . 
  that would have been embarrassing ten years ago , but poland are one of the best developing countries since eu accession . 
  a real success story . 
  poland is definitely more relevant than scotland . 
  these people want to bring back primary and secondary industry to the country want to drag the nation forward into the 70s . 
  it 's incredibly short-sighted , and it all just smacks of ` in the the ~ ~ racist ~ ~ good ~ ~ hairy ~ ~ old days ' . 
  yeah , the real enemy is the irish . 
  the scottish king brought the countries into personal union , you know . 
  ever ? 
  even in the middle ages ? 
  i 'm sure you can pay rowan atkinson to sit on a throne if you like people acting odd . 
  presumably not to a personal bank account though ... ? 
  what about per capita ? 
  does it really count when there 's only two ( and a bit ) regions , though ? 
  all that space is in xinjiang and tibet . 
  you are n't going to bury someone from anhui in western china . 
  that 's worse .

  hardcore - anyone who is part of an esperantist community , wants an esperanto state , raises a child with esperanto , uses it commonly or primarily , is part of international organisations ... you done any of those ? 
  have you tried pasporto servo ? 
  eddie izzard is n't very welcome there . 
  good point . 
  but esperanto does n't really have anything else . 
  i 'd quite like to see an ama from a hardcore esperantist . 
  almaty would be fun . 
  seeing the sheer amount of tourists in mankinis . 
  there should be a flag for the language , rather than using a country flag . 
  any country in the [ european broadcasting union ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/european_broadcasting_union_members.png ) can enter eurovision - it 's the big event if the ebu calendar . 
  many arab nations do n't enter because israel do . 
  morocco entered in one year ( 1970 ? 
  ) , finished terribly and never did again .

  yeah , that author has no agenda .

  in cyprus it 'll be british people , too . 
  military bases , commonwealthy empire stuff and britons buying in the sun . 
  the 70s only arrived in romania in 1984 . 
  it would be applicable if 3/4 of crimea voted to rejoin russia in 2006 after a brief period as part of ukraine as an autonomous region of the soviet union/russia , and then ukraine became independent . 
  this all happening without military intervention . 
  berbatov is , having played a significant portion of his career in the premier league . 
  the uk will take until the cows come home . 
  and ukip are working on immigrant reforms so there 's an annual quota of home-returning cows . 
  what 's that normalised against ? 
  procrastinating from writing . 
   what 's the point [ ... ] ?
