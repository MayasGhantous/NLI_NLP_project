  predicting or setting ? 
  also , though , there 's far more variety in english names than there is in arab names . 
  imagine a hundred tears ago when 80 % the women in the british isles were called mary and half the men were george . 
  it was tradition to use names from the bible for the longest time . 
  so many johns , jacobs , adams and eves . 
  there 's a strange thing in brazil for giving english surnames as first names , like ` newton ' , ` anderson ' , ` franklin ' or ` jeferson ', 
  tagged . 
  as an aside , that 's when the child naming laws of france were relaxed . 
  hence ` enzo ' . 
  a french christmas is an awkward christmas . 
  it 'd be like that if the country , for example , was called obama america , and then a saudi got pissed off for calling them obamans . 
  muricans , man . 
  ca n't live with them , ca n't live with them on the other side of the planet , because they 'll come onto your subreddit anyway . 
  why * do n't * they have full citizenship ? 
  that is n't unique . 
  most countries are n't a single culture . 
  take it for granted that every country has one . 
  [ the ones that do n't are far in the minority .

  it was a joke . 
  spanish gypsies are highly romanticised , viewed like 19th century generic latin americans , spending their days and nights in smoky underground bars dancing flamenco and tango and pasa doble while an old andalusian man plays classical guitar in the corner , clenching a cigar between his brown teeth and only interrupting his songs to glug glass after glass of rioja . 
  it would n't work , just like the jar . 
  almost no jews moved there . 
  mongolia is a state of mostly nomads . 
  i foresee a fanfic alternate history . 
  spain 's roma mostly came through the maghreb , so they 're [ gypsy ] ( http://tellingatale.weebly.com/uploads/8/7/5/4/8754389/693381708.jpg ) , rather than [ gypsy . 
  ] ( http://www.caritas-ab.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabian-weiss_the-dima-girls.jpg ) obviously there are similarities , but they do n't have the image of eastern european ones . 
  give them their own state in the levant . 
  that ca n't go wrong . 
  can anyone eli5 this ? 
  i know there are two macedonias - one being a region of greece - but what exactly is the dispute ? 
  cromwell , for republicanism . 
  lenin or marx , for communism . 
  henry viii , for protestantism . 
  louis pasteur , for germ theory . 
  boris johnson , for laughs on have i got news for you . 
  there has never been racial segregation for black people in europe , so ` apartheid ended a long while ago ' is irrelevant . 
  is this a greek saying ? 
  that 's because you 're american . 
  how does gibraltar politics work ? 
  is there any ukip presence there ? 
  cyprus ? 
  beep beep paging / u/meidei, 
  should be . 
  it 's a school holiday . 
  damn metric system . 
  1 ) why is the us split into states but no other country is ? 
  2 ) what the fuck happened to the map of the states ? 
  the uk really does n't have a flag culture . 
  i do n't recognise any of these . 
  it 's exactly like the flag of nicosia , except red and with seven stars . 
  and israelis are a huge percentage of the west bank 's population . 
   660 citizens, 
  handegg and burgermouth . 
  an indian map of india just looks weird . 
  / r/estoniafromabove, 
  is cypriot tertiary education good ? 
  paging / u/meidei !, 
  gta bucharest, 
  they share it . 
  charge each other a small fee for using their telephone lines . 
  anti-nato ? 
  oh , i thought this meant they were pro-russia . 
  are ataka a slavist or pan-slavist party ? 
  edit : that [ picture ] ( http://jpg.euractiv.com/files/styles/x-large/public/gallery/atakas.jpg?itok=ycuollfl ) was n't chosen with an agenda , was it ? 
  are you seriously suggesting that a helmet does n't help ? 
  but they 're more likely to survive being hit by a car . 
  everything except traffic . 
  saville on the news 25/8 for a year might have something to do with it . 
  source ? 
  this sounds interesting , if true . 
  well you do n't send history essays to your mother , do you ? 
  it 's still something you would n't write home about . 
  in fact , it 's something i 'd never write about because i know shit all about economics . 
  [ it 's further than that now . 
  it 's far from that simple though . 
  even just the fact of the large ethnic minorities on both sides . 
  the mineral , coastal and industrial wealth is in the south and east , so everyone wants the east to be part of their country . 
  depending on the specific split , leaving a rump ukraine could probably impoverish the nation , leaving it with a gdp per capita worse than some countries in sub-saharan africa and no hope of entering the eu within any sort of reasonable timeframe . 
  well that settles it , then . 
  the dinosaur republic is proclaimed today . 
  i think it was damien lewis . 
  he 's probably responsible . 
  do you know why brazil is funding a $ 1b port construction in cuba ? 
  dilma 's all about skirting the us , is n't she ? 
  lots of talk these last few months since the nsa and prism came out , turning down a state visit to the us and this weird cuba stuff , too . 
  fuck , i was going to buy a small village until just now . 
  neutral moresnet eu accession 2028, 
  but does n't solve all . 
  and causes some more . 
  or ffuskcse for short . 
  ... says the motherland . 
  portugal speakers only want to be closer to you ; _ ;, 
  what stops them going further ? 
  a few exclaves * are n't * loyal to the homeland . 
  cabinda , northern ireland ( partly ) ... 
  does that mean kaliningrad oblast residents can visit other schengen countries ? 
  oh , take shots at the british all you want . 
  i 'm barely hanging onto the island . 
  and it looks like crap , too .
