  ah , rs2k , i would n't expect any different from you . 
  i call myself brazilian . 
  because i 'm quirky like that . 
  this is a strange thing . 
  i would never have thought that the english/welsh/scottish / british/other had anything to do with race or religion , and almost scoffed when the picture of people in headscarves appeared at the top . 
  ` here we go again . 
  another `` they 're refusing to integrate '' story again . ', 
  it was the complete opposite of what i thought . 
  sikhs are most british . 
  http://www.euronews.com/business-newswires/2134028-price-cap-plan-wipes-more-than-1-billion-pounds-off-uk-energy-firms/ if it goes ahead , i 'd hate to think of the price explosion when the cap comes off . 
  that last video is quite funny . 
  watching him think on his feet and do the old switcheroo . 
  what other flag would you use ? 
  oh , well i do n't get it then . 
  there 's no switzerland , norway , serbia , russia ... 
  if you are n't part of the organisation that promotes it , you are n't going to be included . 
  it 's not part of the eu ... 
  it 's days vs volume . 
  europe is a state !, 
  amerikkka circle jerk !, 
  go away , you troll . 
  why * did n't * portuguese rule the world like the british empire did ? 
  one would think , having all that age of discovery . 
  watch eddie izzard 's doc series mongrel nation . 
  it includes stuff about the viking legacy still evident in the uk today in toponomy , genetics and other stuff . 
  ( spoilers , the north is viking ) [ a bit . 
  ( warning , contains '90s .

  i read an article written by some scottish islanders who supported shetland/orkney independence if scotland got it . 
  their argument was that scotland could hardly argue against self-determinism and that edinburgh might as well be london when you 're that far north . 
   england alone has a bigger population than the uk as a whole did in the 80s . 
  i do n't understand that . 
  how ?!, 
  but england is * in * the uk . 
  i 'm tired . 
  northern ireland would explode if that happened . 
  it 's too volatile to upset , even now . 
  is it illegal in poland , or are the figures off in some way ? 
  they really stick out , considering the area they 're in . 
  and tunisia . 
  they probably just use the figures available for visible countries . 
  catholicism and islam . 
  basically , religion . 
  fuck me , that 's been a long time . 
  it is n't mostly colour . 
  there are skirts and leggings and different shoes and designs and words and different collars and everything that are made for the specific genders . 
  it 's also a cultural thing to show gender . 
  when you see a transgender child , it 's never a sexual thing . 
  if there were no differences in the way boys and girls dressed , how would they express their gender identity ? 
  she has a degree in medicine and has a phd in public health and fundamental theology . 
  knows her stuff about the christian feminism , then . 
  i respect the fact that she refuses to make a political party , and not just joining the gang of them . 
  she values her beliefs over power . 
  [ see her in action ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/may/17/teresa-forcades-radical-catalan-nun-video ), 
  damage to what ? 
  the catholic church ? 
  they 're doing enough of that themselves . 
   ** sister teresa believes the roman catholic church should be thoroughly modernised for the 21st century . 
  ** she thinks women priests should be welcomed , and that gay people should be allowed to serve openly in the church . 
  and no sportspeople eith ... fuck . 
  oh , i always assumed it had something to do with sun protection , and it got out of hand . 
  even men in desert countries wear full length robes . 
  i have it on good authority that bavaria is the germany in germany . 
  is that ... a face ? 
  i 've seen it before . 
  it 's production areas . 
   a 171-strong swiss company got two kilometres into its neighbour they went right through liechtenstein before knowing they were in it ? 
  i see belgian nationalism . 
  i thought south slav nationalism was the trigger for ww1 . 
  why do you have that flag ? 
  nordkapp , norway . 
  and brain . 
  that 's a very late reply .

  they should send him to j. . . oh . 
  honesty is the best policy . 
  shh ... only teardrops ... 
  your response was very illuminating . 
  language is a subject i 'm very interested in , so the insight into the attitude around greek is valuable , thanks for that . 
  and that article is very convincing . 
  oh , i thought it was a genuine proposal . 
  i read a little while ago that greece and cyprus would save 200 million euros a year if they switched script to roman . 
  does anyone in your country want to adopt a different script ? 
  ... where did that come from ? 
  gibraltar is n't a ` colony ' , it 's an ` overseas territory ' . 
  not to mention the more recent referendums in the 90s and 2000s . 
  it 's probably the tenses . 
  i 'm terrible at that . 
  yes , i was . 
  it was a joke . 
  clearly humour does n't translate ... 
  you do n't have to . 
  there are plenty of free resources to learn languages nowadays .
