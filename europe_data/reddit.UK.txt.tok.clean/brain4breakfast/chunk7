  who are you ? 
  i 'm sure that if they knew this would happen , they would n't vote for it . 
  oh right . 
  are they anything to do with each other ? 
  but it makes sense to include cyprus ? 
  just include everything ; it 's not the end of the world if you do . 
  you would n't include the hexagon . 
  french guiana , why not ? 
  i 'd love to do who do you think you are , because i have a scottish surname despite not having any scottish family to my knowledge . 
  i think it 's something to do with the highland clearances since a couple of my grandparents came from ulster . 
  except this is n't true . 
  how do you account for the disparity between the ex-ussr and the rest of europe ? 
  and why are there no internet users in turkey ? 
  well , that one hill that appears in danish legend . 
  [ seems like a nice little drive .

  that 's lots of people . 
  republic of ireland . 
  just say ireland . 
  i thought that brits would be thought of as rude . 
  imagine going to america where the shop people are ` join my cult ' nice . 
  one can use either in this situation . 
  it 's there . 
  i used to go on google maps and try to get the longest single trip in europe . 
  this is what i used to do . 
  nordkapp to marsala . 
  `` not the worst !, 
  not the worst ! '', 
  the ` who can cook the most disgusting fish ? ', 
  competition amongst the nordics . 
  should n't be news , but it is . 
  makes sense to do so . 
  the other 5 % is ice . 
  the flood was so high , it flooded the boats . 
  it being a landlocked , time-warped dictatorial state hiding in the shadow of russia and being funded by china , i 'm slightly afraid of belarus . 
  white russia . 
  the land of bond villains . 
  canada , the american scotland . 
  india , the chinese mexico !, 
  noooooooo !, 
  we must stop it !, 
  kill all the brown people !, 
  it happens every month or so at the moment . 
  a lot going on in hungary . 
  alright , maybe not ` spring ' from the same place , but all three span thousands of kilometres across the steppes and have for thousands of years . 
  contact is only inevitable . 
  we do n't know the geographical distribution , but perhaps . 
  if the five hundred first-language-ers live in a vast minority in a city of twenty thousand , probably not . 
  indoeuropean languages also spring from roughly the same region , and you 're not claiming they 're related too . 
  any similarities might be from borrowing if they were in that much contact . 
  you ca n't just say ` well they were close . 
  they must be related . ', 
  no true native speakers of cornish . 
  it was revived like new hebrew and manx , and there are five hundred ` new native ' speakers , all of whom also speak english . 
  planet earth ? 
  in a very minority theory that is n't at all common consensus . 
  very few people believe they 're related . 
  [ that 'd give an inaccurate geographical shape similar to this . 
  ] ( http://www.sasi.group.shef.ac.uk/worldmapper/images/largepng/2.png ) imagine adding languages onto * that * map . 
  the eu does have official languages , minority languages and regional languages ; they 're all the countries ' languages together . 
  dutch and finnish and welsh and catalan and english and maltese ... everything . 
  the bananas thing had always been bullshit , and had never been a government policy , or even proposed . 
  it 's an out-of proportion joke about the way supermarkets treat slightly misshapen fruit . 
  i 'd say that britain 's 300-400 year success prior to the 20th century had something to do with it too . 
  yeah , but ` macabre ' is pronounced differently . 
  in no accent or pronunciation does it rhyme with metre ( - t\u0259 [ r ] ) , instead it 's - b / - b\u0281 / - br\u0259 . 
  it having just about kept its french pronunciation in all english dialects , its spelling makes sense even in noah webster 's fairytale perfect language land . 
  the first half of your message sounds so wize , but i 'd advize you about some words that even webster missed . 
  bruise , hollandaise , cruise , malaise , rise , raise . 
  it does make me feel better . 
  is it an old street from colonial times ? 
  what i hate most about noah webster is that he tried to iron out inconsistencies in english and ended up creating more . 
  why ` theater ' and ` meter ' and not ` oger ' and ` aker ' ? 
  and he left the strangest of all : ` rough ' . 
  why ? 
  if he was so inclined to make it ` logical ' , why did n't he spell it ` ruff ' ? 
  why leave so many silent letters ? 
  i hate him . 
  yeah fuck you , noah webster . 
  it 's spelled metre because it 's a french word , you idiot . 
  i would n't say it 's most . 
  only when people say ` great british [ public ] ' as if the ` great ' means ` good ' . 
  then it obfuscates the meaning between the island and the nationality which optionally includes ni . 
  although , my father was certain that the isle of man was part of cumbria because they were the same colour on a county map , and we live there . 
  there is a general ignorance about british/uk/crown things that are n't the four major countries , is n't there ? 
  editorialising is a mirror staple . 
   huge, 
  ' ~ ~ news ~ ~ toilet paper ', 
  alright , mister moneybags . 
  it 's nice to see they 're so respectful about not entering moldova or kaliningrad . 
  immigrants !, 
  immigraaants !, 
  if you do n't like it , move somewhere people do n't want to be . 
  it 's one of the things you get for being born in a place people want to be . 
  [ yeah . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/mao_juzizhou_head.jpg ) i actually misremembered it . 
  it 's built on top , not carved in . 
  that 's what they * want * you to think . 
  that 's why i said ` that we 'd recognise as a nazi salute ' instead of saying ` they nazi-saluted their flag ' . 
  godwin 's law is about arguments , and there was no argument here .
