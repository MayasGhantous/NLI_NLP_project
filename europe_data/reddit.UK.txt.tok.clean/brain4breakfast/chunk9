  first past the post is cack . 
  is it fair to day that a majority of catalonia wants to secede now ? 
  it 's every other day in the news and on / r/europe, 
  way to go , netherlands !, 
  and it 's not even oil . 
  or what 's the best polish pickled thing . 
  your flag flair looks like angola , but says ` antarctica ' . 
  and a frankfurter is n't made of the french . 
  what a rip off . 
  shame it 'll all be pickled meat . 
  you could go very north and to sweden or norway . 
  here 's a little tip for the football : apoel nicosia * . 
  * i know nothing about cypriot football . 
  results may vary . 
  it is n't like there 's any usa on the rest of this site ... 
  can you explain the fire thing in norway ? 
  all i 've seen is polandball comics . 
  handcuffed to death ? 
  woah . 
  very . 
  it 's like they do n't try . 
  it seems to be very easy to put another accent on above english , though . 
  not so much for accents like french , with their letter ` r ' . 
  i 'll never understand that to proclaim yourself independent , you should obey the laws of the country you want to separate yourself from . 
  you have to speak english with some accent . 
  why not your own ? 
  as long as it 's comprehended . 
  i want ` lord supreme being of all beasts ' . 
  none . 
  it 's nearly st patrick 's day , we should realise the us is turning irish around about now . 
  really ? 
  why is this a big deal ? 
  i thought horse meat would be right up the french alley . 
  a german , a pole and an american walk into a bar ... 
  completely right with your language point . 
  people underestimate the effect of accent and vocabulary on the spread of culture and ideas through books , television , film , humour , etc. 
  do n't waste your time . 
  this guy does n't understand english . 
  if you 're arguing about apostrophes , you 're on the right track . 
  maybe if that someone from south texas is actually from mexico . 
  otherwise it is n't close . 
  christmas . 
  easter . 
  erm ... donkey-off-roof day . 
  edit : even christmas is celebrated on the 24th in lots of places . 
   different values , accents , food , priorities , politics , religious breakdowns , mannerisms , words , and anything else you can name . 
  we 're spread across similar distances as well . 
  * if you 're discounting language for europe , the usa 's linguistic differences get discounted . 
  * europe has majority secular states ( scandinavia ) , islamic states ( bosnia , albania , kosovo ) and christian states ( just about the rest ) . 
  i 'd say religious differences are more in europe . 
  * usa has brilliant food . 
  breads and meats ( can also get in germany ) pastries ( also dutch , belgian ) , tex-mex , barbecue , big game foods like bison - you ca n't get that in europe . 
  but the nordic countries have fish dishes you 've never heard of . 
  ones you 'd never eat in a hundred years . 
  eu protected foods have ensured we have the best wines , ciders , ales , cheeses , sausages , cured meats and pasties in the whole world . 
  * [ languages . 
  nothing else needs saying there . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_european_union ) the usa might be bigger , might be richer , might be more powerful , but europe is far , * far * , *** far *** more diverse . 
  and they have no eyes , there no indication that ot 's a polandball comic . 
  it looks like it 's supposed to be data , not a comic . 
  gnetherlands . 
  poland is upside down too . 
  estonia can not into economy . 
  i love how well those jokes translate into english . 
  and they 're funny . 
  slovenes sound like a mini germany . 
  your politics does n't change . 
  every law in the us has to seemingly correspond with a 250 year old document written by rich , white slave-owners in a time of tribes and permanent war . 
  close to where ? 
  yes . 
  german [ ic ] since the goths , then russian/soviet from wwii . 
  belgium is better at food . 
  ( unless you love pickled stuff ), 
  neither declared themselves independent ; they just fought over the same , united piece of territory . 
  all or nothing . 
  also , the crossroads of northern europe . 
  this factor is the same as why italy was so fluid for so long , too . 
  `` thank god you 're alive ! '', 
  do n't be silly . 
  greece , spain and italy are fi -- oh ... 
  i 'm sure germany has many many engineers who would n't mind the south of spain for a few years . 
  not much would stop german companies from building in a different country in the eu, 
  even your coat of arms [ looks worried . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/herb_polski.svg/2000px-herb_polski.svg.png ), 
  `` armoured melonhand '' is entering my vocabulary . 
  i get that , but why does does iceland look like he 's going skiing , why 's finland threatening sweden ? 
  can you explain this picture please ? 
  scotland might , but cameron will never into nordic . 
  he wants to into canada . 
  i 've not heard people complaining . 
  the article is n't complaining , it 's just showing statistics . 
  the comments on the article are mostly taking the piss . 
   what is it about britain that polish people find so appealing ? 
   so how is theresa may or whoever going to attempt to stop hungary and romania from invading in 2014 ? 
   cheap beer that actually tastes bloody good . 
  now that 's progress . 
  thanks poland . 
  [ the migration to the uk as a result of the eu is relatively mild compared to other eu nations . 
  places like germany , austria , belgium have high eu migration rates compared to non-eu .
