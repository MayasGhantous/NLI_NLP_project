very good point . 
  there 's no `` better the devil you know '' argument this time . 
  i 'm pro-independence and i 'm happy that we 're making this move now . 
  i would n't be surprised if this takes 18 to 24 months to plan . 
  i think , fundamentally , scotland is too different to the rest of the uk . 
  we 're further to the left politically , we have different views regarding immigration and refugees , and we have different priorities when it comes to spending ( e.g. 
  more on renewable energy , less on defence ) . 
  that gap has only widened in the last decade . 
  an independent scotland would face plenty of challenges . 
  we ca n't rely on oil as much right now , and we trade more with the uk than the eu , so any scotland-ruk trade could be a nightmare of tariffs and regulations . 
  and then if we need a new currency ... whew . 
  but i want us to be able to change things . 
  i want higher taxes , so we do n't have to cut as much from our public sector to balance out the impact of the trade issue . 
  at the next general election , scotland could vote 100 % for snp candidates and wind up with a tory government , or 100 % for labour candidates and wind up with a tory government ( with a smaller majority ) . 
  there will be difficult things but we can find solutions to them . 
  right now , the westminster government does n't represent the scottish voice . 
  indy ref ii : back in the habit . 
   the union i voted for 2 years ago no longer exists in my opinion . 
  i think this is a really persuasive argument . 
  a lot of the no campaign 's message was `` you do n't want to vote yes and risk leaving the eu '' . 
  second time around it 's reversed : a no vote means you _ will _ 100 % leave the eu , while a yes vote means you can either stay in when ruk leaves , or leave and reapply . 
  as long as you leave the western isles . 
  you 're not getting stornoway black pudding and harris tweed . 
  sadly , it 's like dwarven technology : lost to the ages . 
  well , one can only hope . 
  well done , and thank you . 
  i 'm from the western isle of scotland and you got them all right , though we have two words for sunday and tend to use the other one . 
  l\u00e0 na s\u00e0baid ( day of the sabbath ) rather than did\u00f2mhnach , but really , that 's not your fault . 
  both are correct . 
  as a scot who wanted to remain in the european union , this is such a sweet , sweet moment . 
  irn bru is 100 % a scottish thing and really should n't be applied to n. ireland , wales and england . 
  claim us !, 
  please take us with you !, 
  the president of the united states criticising nato allies . 
  is this not everything putin ever wanted ? 
  haha , fair enough . 
  have a nice day !, 
  y' know , since we 're doing offices . 
  source , since that seems fair : http://petermcnally.org/filter/projects/the-first-minister, 
  there 's also a shadow lord chancellor , which i always liked . 
  i do n't think it 's the referendum result itself , but rather the way it came about . 
  i would wager most people who voted leave did it because of things like immigration and that ' # 350m a week ' thing and all the ridiculous , made-up eu directives like straight bananas . 
  when ` what is the eu ? ', 
  became a highly-searched term on google * after * the referendum , everyone just looks silly . 
  i think that 's why the uk looks stupid over this whole affair , rather than the result . 
   they will feel resentful for the brexiters at first but they will eventually forgive them . 
  they can because they are wise . 
  i voted remain and i doubt i 'll ever forgive those who voted leave . 
  we had a ... well not a * debate * , but a thing ... last night with may and jeremy corbyn , the leader of the opposition . 
  it was two interviews back to back rather than a head-to-head debate . 
  the audience laughed at may a few times . 
  the uk 's a laughing stock in the uk , never mind the rest of europe . 
  ooh . 
  ok . what did i miss ? 
  thank you , france . 
  as a scot who still believes in the ideals of the eu , this is a good day . 
  the south has the cities , so it has people and jobs and nightlife and the symphony and restaurants . 
  it also has crime and pollution . 
  the north has mountains and beaches and nice people who welcome you in for tea , and you do n't need to lock your front door , nor knock when you 're going in , and the air is cleaner and the water is purer and everything is far more relaxed and laid-back . 
   are there any popular ideas for altering your country 's current administrative organisation ? 
  ho , ho , yes !, 
  let me tell you about --  i 'm not including independence movements . 
  well , damn . 
  uk-wide , there 's always been decent popular support for abolishing or reforming the house of lords ( our upper chamber ) to remove those who are unelected . 
  some argue it 's necessary because you can bring experts into your cabinet by sticking them in the lords , for instance if you wanted your nuclear policy run by , say , a nuclear physicist . 
  others do n't like the idea someone like andrew lloyd webber can vote on basically nothing for decades but then fly back to london when there 's going to be a close vote on welfare reform . 
   full on federalisation would remove westminster 's ability to revoke these devolved powers at will basically , yes , this is the difference . 
  right now there are plenty of powers devolved to scotland , wales and ni ( though the latter does n't really have a government right now but that 's a different issue ) , but at any moment the uk government could take them all back again . 
  it would n't , because the tory government in westminster knows taking back all powers from scotland only helps the independence movement , but it _ could if it wanted to _ and that 's what a fully federalised system would prevent . 
  i assume the folk are lovely . 
  maduro 's gone all dictatorial and i feel sorry for the populace because their country unfortunately probably is n't getting better any time soon . 
  that we 're cheap . 
  i 've never seen this in person . 
  the other ones are all true : we 're drunk , we 're angry , far too many people in our largest city are bigoted , we 're drunk , our diet kinda sucks , we 'd rather see football outlawed than have england win the world cup , and we drink a lot . 
  but we 're not super stingy . 
  socks or barefoot . 
  hey , they 're allowed in eurovision . 
  when is epiphany ? 
  how long do you have to wait before you can dry white cloths ? 
  also unlucky in some parts of continental europe , i believe . 
  it 's always been considered good luck where i 've lived , but i can see why it would be seen as bad luck elsewhere . 
  which kind of shows you how stupid the whole thing is , does n't it ? 
  * if you drop salt , you have to throw it over a shoulder ( i forget which one . 
  i think it 's something to do with the devil , so probably the left . ), 
  * if your nose itches , you 'll be angry soon . 
  * if you leave the teapot lid up , you 'll get a visitor . 
  * walking under a ladder is bad luck . 
  * a black cat crossing your path is good luck . 
  * opening an umbrella indoors will bring bad luck to the people in the house here too . 
  * there 's also something about magpies , like you 're supposed to wish them well or something , lest they curse you with misery . 
  i got most of these from my 79-year-old grandmother . 
  younger people obviously are n't as superstitious as older generations . 
  we played a lot of football , obviously , but we also played ** high tig ** a fair bit in primary . 
  standard rules but you were safe as long as you were climbing on something ( wall , tree ) . 
  i think we also had a version of hide and seek , only we called it ** 45pm ** , and the goal was to lure the seeker away so you could all get from your hiding spots back home . 
  first one caught became the new seeker . 
  in high school , we had one called ** death hill ** . 
  we were n't imaginative with the names . 
  we had a fuck off big hill at the edge of one of the football fields ; it was super steep and the flat bit at the top was only about 30 cm deep before the fence , so really everyone up there would be single-file , if you can picture it . 
  at the start , everyone ran up the hill .
