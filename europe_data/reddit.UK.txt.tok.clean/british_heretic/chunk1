i 'm not good at compliments rubbish , that brought a tear to my eye ... 
  i 'm going to put it down to ignorance ( optimistic perhaps ) rather than purely malicious intent , but i do n't think there are many brits that would treat our troubled history so lightly . 
  either you do n't understand the magnitude of what has happened between britain and ireland , or you simply do n't care , but either way this is not a situation where banter is really applicable . 
  what the uk have done to ireland in the past is not far off genocidal , so i do n't think humour is ever applicable . 
  there are a multitude of ways in which you can light-heartedly mock the irish , but `` our silly little irish ... '' ... ouch . 
  please do n't ... 
  especially english !, 
  actually yes , that is a very pertinent distinction . 
  i think if i had become politically aware during the labour years i may well have become a labour voter , but with this centrist mob , not a chance . 
  labour should just stop trying ... 
  david `` call me dave '' cameron is a corrupt prick . 
  [ bonus create-your-own dave poster website ] ( http://mydavidcameron.com/ ), 
  that 's quite a bigoted comment ... 
  if we had an eu referendum , it would be as the uk not it 's constituent members , so `` scotland '' would n't have a choice beyond influencing the wider vote . 
  i try !, 
  une cafe au lait et un t\u00e9 silvous plait ... jasas , jamas , parakolo , errm , tha ethela something ... see , it 's really better if i just stick to english !, 
  that 's a great idea , but i 'm an ignorant brit who only knows random phrases in other languages . 
  that 's a great idea , but i 'm an ignorant brit who only knows random phrases in other languages . 
  is azerbaijan asian ? 
  i know geographically it straddles continents , but it 's a former soviet state and in the council of europe ... 
  ouch ... totally true though . 
  _ salivating intensifies _, 
  a couple of highlights , because most people complaining of `` entitlement '' have n't read the damn article :  the poll of detainees found that 29 per cent rated the food as ` good ' or ` very good ' . 
  according to the catering guidelines , detainees at immigration removal centres are entitled to meals that meet ` cultural ' and ` diversity ' needs . 
  a poll ... ~ ~ there ~ ~ they were _ asked _ if they liked the food etc , they did n't seek out authorities to complain to . 
   according to the catering guidelines , detainees at immigration removal centres are entitled to meals that meet ` cultural ' and ` diversity ' needs the detention centre has been ordered to improve the menu , by the authorities , because it does not meet standards defined in the catering guidelines . 
  this is a case of brit-on-brit , not migrants with a sense of entitlement . 
  do you mean [ black pudding ] ( http://cdn.playbuzz.com/cdn/841512d6-8dea-403d-aad0-585b7a496d20/5ab4e52d-8959-494b-83e9-e36d8d4c9fc2.jpg ) ?

  i think you 'll find that most british people ( most certainly me ) will agree with you on that point . 
  i 'm working from my [ dining room ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6dqzerj.jpg ) that is temporarily doubling-up as a very shit studio . 
  i really like ievan polkka . 
  i have _ no _ idea how or why i came across it but it 's been in my collection ever since . 
  it 's just so upbeat and jolly that i ca n't not like it !, 
  i hate that vacuous waste of skin . 
  she at least makes herself an easy target for ridicule . 
  [ case in point ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fp_gokhrt0 ) [ additional case in point ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdyalpzhg_8 ), 
  i read on the bbc that part of the agreement is they privatise their electric grid ... 
   having a convenient distribution platform and policy goes a long way to making sure that people who can buy your shit , do so this is so painfully simple , and yet industry seems too slow to learn this . 
  there are great advances now , but it 's been a long time coming . 
  since the advent of all-you-can-eat content like spotify and netflix my own need for _ other _ content sources has dried up . 
  sure i ca n't always watch the latest episode of something , but it 's a great trade-off . 
  have you ever tried our pissy lager ? 
  it 'd take 12 cans of carling to even feel it ... 
  i 've never done that , although i have added black pudding before ... devine !, 
  of course it is , but it is kinda basic ... 
  but it is amazing . 
  have a toad-in-the-hole and let 's have this conversation again !, 
  actually ... yeah ok, 
  we 're only in bronze medal position i 'm afraid , andorra and turkey are tied in first place . 
  indeed , we all know that wachau riesling is the best riesling, 
  if it means we can escape a conservative government , i 'm in !, 
  no , we do n't need capitals for that ... second , second , second : a noun , a verb and an adjective !, 
  english confuses the hell out of me . 
  i still had n't made my mind up when i walked into the polling station . 
  fortunately it was really quiet so i had time to stand in the booth and contemplate ... hovered over labour for a while ( tactical ) but ended up ticking the libdem box , just like i did last time . 
  i like the greens , but i think they 've got some growing to do and i 'll certainly be watching them with interest . 
   61 % voted for statehood , they have not become a state , i 'm not sure what i 'm not reading correctly here . 
  i do not proclaim to be an expert in statistics , but this seems fairly straight forward . 
  i 'm open to corrections . 
  seems they do want statehood : ~ ~ they do n't though : ~ ~ edit : c&p error ...  on november 6 , 2012 , a two question referendum took place , simultaneous with the general elections . 
  [ 143 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] the first question asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the u.s. constitution . 
  the second question posed three alternate status options if the first question was approved : statehood , independence or free association . 
  [ 145 ] for the first question , 54 percent voted against the current commonwealth status . 
  for the second question , 61.16 % voted for statehood , 33.34 % for a sovereign free associated state , and 5.49 % for independence .

  it 's not like they wo n't pay any income tax , they just wo n't pay income tax to the us , but i think they pay enough to get a vote ... 
  i do n't understand how a democracy can have a territory that falls under its laws but has no means to hold the law makers accountable . 
  they ** do ** pay tax :  though the commonwealth government has its own tax laws , puerto ricans are also required to pay most u.s. federal taxes , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] with the major exception being that some residents do not have to pay the federal personal income tax . 
  in 2009 , puerto rico paid $ 3.742 billion into the us treasury . 
  [ 9 ] residents of puerto rico pay into social security , and are thus eligible for social security benefits upon retirement . 
  however , they are excluded from the supplemental security income ( ssi ) , and the island actually receives a small fraction of the medicaid funding it would receive if it were a u.s. 
  state . 
  [ 10 ] also , medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in puerto rico , even though the latter paid fully into the system . 
  [ 11 ] [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxation_in_puerto_rico ), 
  weird one puerto rico , it 's technically the `` free associated state of puerto rico '' ... but puerto rican 's do n't even get to vote in us elections even though they are under us jurisdiction . 
  not us ... we 've a reputation to maintain, 
  we can help with that, 
  we ca n't help it !, 
  some of us tan ok , given the chance ... 
  the uk being 4th disproves this theory ;o) case in point : a guy at work asked a bulgarian colleague what she thought of british men . 
  her answer , `` no offence , but you 're all fat and pink '', 
  but the uk _ is _ a special snowflake  regardless of what other nations have in their agreements , this would be an unprecedented level of negotiation , and domestically if it is immigration that people care about then the incumbent government would be committing political suicide if they accepted free movement of people as part of the agreement . 
  i personally have no issue with freedom of movement , i 'm hugely on the fence with the referendum and movement of people is n't a topic for me , but nobody can state what may happen next as fact ... nothing is known , everything is possible . 
  you ca n't state that as fact . 
  if we leave the eu there would be negotiations , nothing is off the table . 
  the uk needs to trade with the eu , and the eu needs to trade with the uk . 
  that would be sortie ... sortit !, 
  they could be non-organic ... 
  [ one day you will rule the seven seas , but first you must dislodge the swiss ] ( https://i.imgur.com/rj3aqit.png ), 
  i deserve it ... 
  that was technically the normans , so i like to think it was the northern european part of the genetics that made that victory possible ,
