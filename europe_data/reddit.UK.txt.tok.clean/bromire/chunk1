smarmy and petulant reply it is . 
  you obviously did n't read my comment so i realise i 'm wasting my time , innabit dickhead, 
  4 % * [ like this fella said ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/551ctl/german_business_chief_uk_should_go_for_hard_brexit/d883dom ) , you said world economy which accounts for a countries wealth ( gdp ) and that 's 4 % not 2 % . 
  yours includes ppp ( purchasing power parity ) and accounts for the cost goods , services and inflation rates of the country . 
  here 's a link , i 'm just echoing what 's already available for you to read : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) the fact is though it 's not as useful when assessing a country 's trading power and global economic presence like nominal gdp : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) again , you can be smarmy when you think your right - or you can take a correction gracefully and not come across like a petulant manchild, 
  96 % *  the economy of the united kingdom is the fifth-largest national economy in the world measured by nominal gross domestic product ( gdp ) and ninth-largest in the world measured by purchasing power parity ( ppp ) , comprising 4 % of world gdp . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_united_kingdom ) love how you call someone a smart arse for correcting you . 
  confirms my suspicion that you 're willfully ignorant, 
   has the highest ratio of services exports to gdp in the g7 . 
  britain 's gdp is also more dependent on financial services than any other of the g7 . 
  that is all going to take a hit with brexit . 
  it 's easy to import a car , but a lot more difficult to export labour to foreign services . 
  no argument here on that . 
  i 'm fully aware the ultimate outcome wo n't be positive . 
  i just refuse to accept it when people arrogantly state : `` uk economy is going to go down the shitter '' `` eu is just going to get stronger '' `` if the uk is on its own ww3 will occur '' `` you wont get ur empire bak l0l '' like the guy i replied to , he compared the uk to california like its a bad thing . 
  some people just enjoy slagging off the uk . 
  the uk has a strong economy and can easily survive a hard brexit . 
  just because the citizens wanted an end to the free movement of people , it does n't make them racist xenophobes who should be subject to abuse . 
  could you reveal the location of your economical crystal ball please ? 
  yes ? 
  we agree then ? 
  the germans will be sorely missing a large part of their export market ? 
   german service sector is even bigger than the one of the uk in absolute numbers . 
  the uk is not the only country with a service sector . 
  how is that relevant ? 
  [ only 70 % of germany 's gdp comes from the service sector ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_germany ) . 
  the numbers are irrelevant here , what we 're focusing on is a countries dependency on manufacturing and agriculture - which happens to be 30 % for germany . 
  the service sector is internalised so it has little dependency on trade deals . 
  ( with the big exception of the nhs and free movement of people )  also , since the uk depends so much on the service sector , it is even more important for the uk to remain in the eu . 
  banks are easily replaced . 
  physical products not so much . 
  i 'm debating if you even know what the service sector is at this point . 
   france and germany are larger , if you include countries that are in the eu , which you have done . 
  the argument was if we left the eu , we would be the largest non-eu importer . 
  so i repeat , how on earth does this lead you to believe the uk economy will suffer whilst the eu economy will bolster ? 
   since 16 % of eu trade is done with the uk , it will have minor negative effects on the eu . 
  do you genuinely believe 16 % is minor , fuck me  you think that since some partner is important for the uk , the uk is also important for this partner . 
  you do realise the eu has legislation that creates incentive for countries to trade inside the union , as opposed to outside of it . 
  importing off the eu is n't ** dependecy ** , it 's convenient/cheap trade . 
  once we 're out the eu there is no incentive , we will look for the most efficient imports for out company . 
  let me explain it simply : a nation depends on its exports to sell well , it does not depend on access to imports nearly as heavily . 
  `` your gdp is smaller than the 10th biggest economy , you suck '' let 's forget the fact that it was higher than california 's in 2013 , how is that bad ? 
  the uk accounts for 4 % of the global gdp . 
  the uk has the fastest growing gdp percentage out of all the g7 nations . 
  you are deluding yourself if you think there 's no wealth in the uk  no one country 's economy will suffer more than the uk going to stop here , it 's clear you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
   but europe is more important for britain than the rest of the globe what ? 
  how did you come to that conclusion . 
  the wikipedia links you included pretty much show how ignorant you are . 
  in regard to the ` great sources of data ' you have linked , you are ** completely ** glossing over the fact that population of each country and its gdp is ** paramount ** to decoding this data to make a substantial statistical point . 
  the uk primarly imports , our manufacturing industry is non existant relative to the world stage . 
  we make our wealth through the service sector ( 78 % of the gdp ) , with minor additions in tourism and exports . 
  your mish mash of wikipedia links with no context just shows how little you know about this . 
  [ we are the single largest importer of eu goods outside the eu ] ( https://fullfact.org/media/uploads/the_eu_s_largest_single_export_market_.png ) ; if you seriously think leaving is going to deteriorate the uk economy and bolster the eu economy you are living in a bubble . 
  scotland wo n't be leaving the uk anytime soon . 
  they only just had a referendum in 2014 . 
  snp will likely push for it , but is unlikely to occur in the next 5 years . 
  many more scots voted in the scottish referendum than the uk one ; they had somewhere around 50 % turnout . 
  they did n't care about the eu nearly as much as snp claimed . 
  as for the result of negotiations , i 'm confident that this is the most likely outcome : no free movement of people , no single market , tariffed trade until a further date . 
  politicians , the public , and the media have - while being brexit skeptical - insisted on the importance of the mandate to leave and its association with ending free movement of people . 
  next most likely outcome is soft-brexit . 
  reason this is unlikely is largely due to the fact that the vast majority of voters wanted to end freedom of movement , there 'll be degree of civil unrest if this is what 's resolved . 
  chances of no brexit at all are extremely unlikely , but we will be in limbo for a good while that is certain . 
  he 's talking about the scottish referendum, 
  what 've you got against the trafford centre m8, 
  yes , glad i found this . 
  [ for the uninitiated ] ( http://www.themoviescene.co.uk/reviews/_img/3813-2.jpg ), 
   he gets the passport but it says great britain and northern ireland holy fucking shit are you even reading what i 'm typing . 
  like i said earlier , what it lists on the passport is location . 
  location . 
  i already told you that great britain , is a place . 
  it 's mainland britain . 
  even if the republic of ireland joined back into the union it still would n't say great britain on the passport , ireland is n't in great britain . 
  that 's only wales , scotland and england . 
  so it would say great britain & ireland . 
   like you said just cause your from the british isles does n't mean you 're allowed a uk passport so by definition they 're not truly british but some from of irish living in the uk . 
  no what the hell . 
  how are they not truly british ? 
  like i said before , british means both , being a member of the uk and living in a region of the british isles . 
  you can be either one , both , or none . 
  getting a uk passport is not the be-all-end-all of what it means to be british . 
  i 'll give you another example : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isle_of_man take a look at the isle of man . 
  currently they are a crown dependency within the british isles that are not a part of the united kingdom . 
  they are pretty much identical to people from republic of ireland . 
  ask anyone from the isle of man if they 're british , and they 'll answer yes . 
  but they are not a part of the uk , living in the uk is something else entirely . 
   go on r/ukpolitics and you will see all the true british people call the dup irish terrorist.it 's just the way most people in britain see northern ireland and there 's no way around that . 
  `` true british people '' ??? 
  what makes someone a fucking true british person ? 
  is that when you have decided if they are or not , ey ? 
  fucking ridiculous . 
  r/ukpolitics , like many subreddits , has a biased hivemind . 
  that hivemind happens to be left wing and supports labour . 
  so of course they 're going to slag off who jumps in bed with the tories . 
  it has nothing to do with ni , and has everything to do with tribalism , and hating the tories . 
  you 're selectively picking information to support your arguments , and ignoring all nuance and context . 
  so this is probably a waste of my time . 
   my friend from dublin tried to apply for a uk passport but was denied because he is irish . 
  he argued he is from the british isles . 
  do you think he got a uk passport ?
