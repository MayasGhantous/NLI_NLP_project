whether it 's considered fair or not , it could n't be politically any worse timing in the uk . 
  it 's not a competition . 
   i really do n't see how america is abusing britain or pushing them around . 
  i do know that many brits think that their government is america 's puppet , but that seems like scapegoating . 
  quite right , they just passing the blame on to someone else . 
  also most of accusations in that article have no context . 
   as recently as the 1930s , the us had secret plans to attack britain . 
  these were aimed more at eliminating british influence ( especially in canada ) than actual war with the uk , but even so . 
  uk and canada also had plans to secretly attack us . 
  it 's what bored military advisers do , plan for everything ...  nonetheless , they played a cynical blinder with the lend-lease programme which was a disgusting piece of asset stripping in the guise of aid to nations that had no choice . 
  on the other hand the uk got the most money of all european nations from the marshal plan . 
   iraq as others mentioned blair was all over this too . 
   ira ok well yeah was a bit of a sore issue * some * naive americans helped fund at one point . 
  but at same time a lot of us politicians have done tremendous work in arbitrating the northern ireland peace process ( something many brits are completely unaware of ) . 
  blair deserves credit here too ( that and sierra leone some of the better things from his legacy ) . 
  the article in general is mainly just a badly informed expression of anxiety towards being a post-imperial power . 
  one day , there will be articles in us newspapers like this too !,

  when do you draw the cut offline time ? 
  i mean should we be going back to brythonic only names in scotland at least in areas that were n't part of the irish gaellic speaking d\u00e1l riata kingdom . 
  i thought it was now officially a kind of portmanteau anyway `` derry/londonderry '' . 
  also affectionately known also a stroke city . 
  was n't just london too , other cities like hull had half their population made homeless . 
  obviously there are other countries that were more devastated but the uk was wrecked and broke . 
  rationing did n't end till 1954 . 
  the uk was one of the most mobilised countries fighting and by the end of it what industry that was left , was ran into the ground . 
  the government soon realised the empire was up , not just from a growing sense of nationalism and desire for independence , but british soldiers were tired and ready to go home with no desire to fight against these aspirations , and in some cases even mutinying . 
  my theory why the uk is still a bit obsessed with ww2 is that it was arguably a pyrrhic victory . 
  no real strategic or economic gains like were for the other allies . 
  the only way it can be celebrated for british people is that of it being a moral victory and that means banging on about it all the time !, 
  well i think it 's neither here nor there . 
  but probably the crucial difference is that all the scottish parties with significant mandate are pro-eu . 
  the tories in scotland just have too toxic and image even for anti-eu supporters to vote for them . 
  have you ever looked at the numbers from scotland , it 's hardly more pro-eu . 
  here 's some numbers for you :  in favour : 41  against : 38  do n't know : 21 [ source ] ( http://wingsoverscotland.com/the-mind-of-the-nation-part-1/ ), 
  i think the last 50 years have been . 
  sure we had an empire before , but life was pretty crap for most people . 
  it 's still crap for some people but no where near as bad as before . 
   scotland have been under domination for so long actually was scotland that acquired england . 
  but low-landers were saxons before that anyway . 
  i guess could argue cultural domination through sheer numbers . 
  i guess different schools taught it differently , shameful aspects were explored at my school . 
  one of my favourite quotes from the article  in addition the norm regulated activities of a non-offensive nature ; thus by mutual agreement working parties between the lines were often un-molested-these might include soldiers who emerged in daylight to cut grass in front of their trenches . 
  similarly each side would often allow the other to deliver the front-line rations without interference . 
  one infantryman observes that ` it is only common courtesy not to interrupt each other 's meals with intermittent missiles of hate ' , while on occasion game was shot in no-man 's - land and retrieved with complete confidence in daylight ' from another solider  ` the most unpopular man in the trenches is undoubtedly the trench mortar officer , he discharges the mortar over the parapet into the german trenches . 
  for obvious reasons it is not advisable to fire a trench mortar too often , at any rate from the same place . 
  but the whole weight of public opinion in our trench is directed against it being fired from anywhere at all ', 
  i certainly would n't want to be a minority group if there was too much direct democracy or everything was put to a referendum . 
   the labour party , the so-called party of the working man , does n't trust the working man with the future of his own country . 
  it 's beyond a joke . 
  not sure dictatorship of the masses is the solution either . 
  this was n't parliamentary democracy , was direct democracy . 
  also from what i understand it would have been fairly difficult to get 40 % as the electoral role was largely out of date and contained many registrations who would not have been able to vote . 
  still 51 % not a particularly convincing mandate . 
  well to be fair labour did rectify this when they finally got back into power . 
  even better there will be some saying like they did for av , `` vote no , because while we need voting reform just not exactly this kind of reform ... '' . 
  oh yeah because there 's going to be another referendum on the table this century ... ? 
  if there is a 40 % rule , then if you are a no voter , why bother going to the polling station when you can just sit at home and achieve the same thing . 
  from what i understand any scot born before independence would still retain their uk citizenship . 
  could be quite an interesting situation where most the population are eu citizens but their resident country is not . 
  a bit unrelated he gets discussed in the rise and fall of the soviet empire . 
  he seemed to have been humiliated by stalin quite a bit , who never took him seriously . 
  but the author gave him a lot of credit for his high levels of chutzpah and being able to play a very limited hand so well . 
  very interesting stuff . 
  ww2 was a strategic loss for the uk and for that reason why i think they have clung so strongly to their sense of a moral victory , which perhaps is also a detriment to integration as they did n't get that wakeup call that other countries on the mainland continent did . 
  well i do n't think many if any company in the world is generally ran well , it 's a case of which company is ran least badly . 
   there is only one thing in life worse than being talked about , and that is not being talked about . 
  antidisestablishmentarianists would fight strongly against that !, 
  interesting . 
  my main source is a geneticist called stephen oppenheimer [ link ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/science/06brits.html ) . 
  he suggests that  the principal ancestors of today 's british and irish populations arrived from spain about 16,000 years ago , speaking a language related to basque . 
  i would be interested to find some critique of his methods or conclusion . 
  recent genetic evidence suggest that the majority of people both in britain and ireland come from pre-celtic inhabitants who moved here after the ice retreated . 
  possibly most closely related to basques . 
  since then various waves of elites brought there culture with them . 
  celts , saxons , vikings and normans and left various genetic imprints , though never enough to change base average overall population in their favour . 
  in britain people often say we are a mongrel nation of various invaders , but we are not really . 
  we 're actually one of the least genetically diverse places . 
  on one poll , it 's slightly more pro-eu . 
  my point stands that scotland is not significantly more pro-eu and from the content of alex 's speech it does n't look likely will pursue particularly pro-eu policies either . 
  i 'm only seeing small percentage differences between scotland and london , for example 29 % to 30 % to leave the eu . 
  i 'm really not seeing any fundamentally big differences in attitudes . 
  i used to regularly track the yougov polls and scottish public opinion was consistently at a similar level with london in terms of pro-eu . 
  wings over scotland had an excellent survey a while back . 
  [ link ] ( http://wingsoverscotland.com/the-mind-of-the-nation-part-1/ ) where support for the eu was 41 against 38 which is not particularly convincing . 
  do n't fall into the trap of mistaking the electability of ukip in scotland as an indication of the scottish electorates feelings on the eu . 
  at best we 're talking about a couple of percentages . 
  but generally london is the most pro-eu place in the uk . 
  welcome to the scottish independence debate , 
  i 'm wondering how much it will affect people on day to day , as long as everyone renews their uk passports before secession should cover even for some lengthy negotiation !, 
  the scottish electorate is similarly euro skeptic as england . 
  i 'm pretty sure while there may be some good initial intentions the reality will set in once the democratic spotlight is shining fully on edinburgh . 
  scotland will be a new and periphery country outside the eurozone so will have little weight to push it 's interests without getting ruk on board . 
  this may change over time and i think being a renewable energy powerhouse could be a path out of this . 
  so england is a bad influence on us ? 
   it 's worth pointing out that scotland within the uk has far less power than the uk does within the eu . 
  people like myself want to leave because we feel it is impossible to build a fairer society while westminster is in control . 
  well previous to the current coalition , did n't we just have a government primarily backed by the scottish electorate for 13 years ? 
  including a cabinet dominated by scots .
