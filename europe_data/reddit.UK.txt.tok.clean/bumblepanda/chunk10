  i was about to say that we have the same breakfast roll in the uk but actually none of the breakfast options here has sausage and bacon . 
  fair play to you !, 
  the only item unique on the uk menu is a bacon roll . 
  well that 's partly the point i am making !, 
  well there are many more countries that are successful without being part of a super union ( japan , south korea , israel , singapore , botswana ) , basically any country with solid democratic systems and good education . 
  if the eu federation is for the purpose of guaranteeing all member states those qualities since they are not capable of doing it themselves then fair enough i suppose . 
  otherwise i do n't see how small countries will be `` consumed '' although i agree it is beneficial to be part of a larger union . 
  the problems i refer to are that people want to be independent . 
  even scotland that has been in a beneficial union for 300 years is on the verge of leaving the uk . 
  also look at catalonia . 
  if you somehow achieved a eu federation , inevitably people will fight for independence since sovereignty is more valuable than being part of a big union . 
  you are likely well educated and probably have the idea of `` educating the masses '' that the union will be good for them . 
  but time and time again history teaches us that people do not buy into this ( fall of all the european colonial empires , breakup of ussr , yugoslavia ) . 
  furthermore the states would not be equal . 
  germany by virtue of sheer population and economic power would run the show . 
  you would have to split countries into roughly equal states or tell germans they have much less power per person than say a maltese . 
  this is the issue with california in the us and there are murmurs there of independence . 
  the situation would be way more extreme here . 
  overall it simply can not work . 
  it is a nice idea but not in our lifetime . 
  i predict the entire world will become some type of single federation and there will be no countries before there is a european federation . 
  how will we be consumed by world powers ? 
  australia , nz and canada seem to be alright . 
  i think a fed eu is a nice idea but it would cause more problems than it would solve . 
  you would suddenly get loads of independence movements and resulting divisions/potential violence . 
  hell the 300 year old union of uk is barely holding together ( and funnily enough eu federalists tend to sympathise with scottish independence ), 
  pretty much all of them , examples from one famous comedy duo : france : https://youtu.be/sbhjssjwum4 netherlands : https://youtu.be/irfluamkooy germany : https://youtu.be/dopr-6x9h7c irish https://youtu.be/oekus6ei_qq northern irish https://youtu.be/wxpyw_w5pgo italy : https://youtu.be/j0m2e-td-_c polish : https://youtu.be/ssuj9b96w9u denmark : https://youtu.be/xax205vig_m greeks : https://youtu.be/0myssexiljc south africa and usa https://youtu.be/ykq-_adfrma scottish : https://youtu.be/slu1ouykmik welsh : https://youtu.be/orwoj5weyqc a variety of countries : https://youtu.be/g4gxamb1w6o, 
  as the average english person we usually learn french as a second language at school and i have found it thoroughly useless outside of france . 
  i reckon you have a point with spanish . 
  seems way more useful on a global level . 
  never learnt spanish but it is always popping up in music i like , tv shows ( narcos :p / bits of breaking bad ) . 
  also loads of us end up moving to spain and holidaying on spanish islands , plus spending `` gap yahs '' to `` discover ourselves '' in south america . 
  not sure if this geographically fits your itinerary but la palma ( canary islands ) is an undiscovered gem ( apart from for old german hikers ) . 
  amazing empty ( black ) soft sand beaches , incredible mountains ( famous for hosting observatories ) , `` mordoor '' like scenery in the south where a volcano erupted in the 70 's , snorkelling sites , whale watching , many interesting hiking routes , varied cuisine . 
  its fun to just rent a car and explore the tiny island . 
  i enjoyed my time there more than malta although both are amazing . 
  if you are in south west europe it 's also worth checking out morocco ( marrakech ) . 
  everything is so cheap and it is an awesome cultural experience . 
  started by the french , they effectively gave up . 
  the americans feared a `` domino effect '' of countries falling to communism and went on and started offensively bombing north vietnam ( using thing like the gulf of tonkin incident to justify it ) . 
  it was about preventing the spread of communism . 
  the unjust french war was not really relevant in terms of motives !, 
  ( we were taught ), 
  i guess so , both countries contain poor black people that are subjected to police brutality and live in appalling poverty . 
  so the uk is either in the eu or not a friend ? 
  as a remain voter , thanks eu !, 
  considering the typical uk food stereotype , i feel no sympathy !, 
  well often the limits will be 50 , and most people are cruising through at 70plus, 
  but with those would you actually still get done for doing 80 ? 
  does the old 10 % +2 rule still apply ? 
  also i have been driving around the m25 for years smashing those gantry speed limits and never got anything . 
  maybe they will suddenly switch it on though !, 
  technically it is `` doms '' in english ( delayed onset muscle soreness ) , but yea still not one word !, 
  not sure if this counts as `` illegal '' but the speed limit on motorways ( highways ) is 70 mph and it is not enforced at all . 
  most people drive at 80ish and many go faster . 
  it is pretty much unheard of to get a speeding ticket doing 80 . 
  it just seems to be at the police discretion . 
  i wish they would set 80 as the limit and actually strictly enforce it so everyone has an idea what the `` actual '' limit is . 
  uk : adjective : british , english , welsh , scottish , northern irish , whatever you prefer . 
  noun : briton , englishman , welshman , scot , northern irishman ( ?? ), 
  good question about female equivalents . 
  never heard `` englishwoman '' before , in fact people never really use nouns and prefer to use the adjective . 
  if it ever does come up in the news it is usually `` three britons are feared dead ... '' , i guess to cover all of the uk and to be genderless . 
  u.k. = england , scotland , wales , northern ireland . 
  everything else `` near '' gb is a crown dependency , and everything else is an overseas territory . 
  its not that hard !, 
  gibraltar is not part of the uk , it is an overseas territory . 
  forgot to mention sealand , that is a proud independent nation !, 
  pledge of allegiance . 
  that shit is creepy . 
  i see , its not as much less than the uk than i thought since for us it would be 33 % , and that includes totally `` free '' healthcare . 
  although our employer pays more taxes direct to the government for each employee so the effective tax rate is higher . 
  plus we have `` council tax '' paid irrespective of income for local services like bin collection . 
  it is based on the value of your home and is typically around # 1000 a year . 
  out of interest , how much tax would you pay on 100,000 dollars per year . 
  and how much health insurance do you pay a year ? 
  well both reduce or eliminates tariffs , and brexiteers would argue the eu waters down sovereignty . 
  out of interest why are you against ceta ? 
  how is it worse than the existing agreements between eu countries . 
  maybe the west highland line . 
  made famous by harry potter .

  theory test , and practical test . 
  theory is multiple choice questions and `` hazard perception '' where you have to watch a dash cam video and touch the hazards . 
  practical test includes 45 mins of driving including manoeuvres such as parallel parking , 3 point turn . 
  we also have to know some basic maintenance . 
  auto test = auto licence . 
  it keeps on changing so my knowledge may be out of date . 
  presumably it is similar to ireland . 
  no doubt some scandinavians will shortly post some insane procedure that takes years and involves learning to rally drive/drift . 
  yup , obscene shows of military strength are not really very british unless we are returning from a military campaign to retake islands in the south atlantic . 
  ceremonial displays are much preferred and are so much more civilised :p, 
  australia for sure !, 
  amazing food , wildlife , weather , sea , people . 
  nice to see the old colonies doing well in this sub . 
  `` your welcome !! '', 
  from the uk to all those starting a better life in canzaus :p ( joke !, 
  ! , i know those countries are great for many other reasons ), 
  the uk is european . 
  its just we exported that brand of `` european-ness '' around the world to canada , aus , nz , arguably the us , systems of government of many countries such as india .
