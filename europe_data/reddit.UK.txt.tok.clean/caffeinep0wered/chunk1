  she 's been all over the isles so her accent is mutilated beyond all recognition . 
  my oh hails from that end of the world and i would probably be stabbed if i called it londonderry . 
  actually , the first time i did she was all `` call it londonderry again and you can feck off out the door and never , ever come back you loyalist shitehead '' . 
  you can guess which side she 's from . 
  you 're full of shit , son . 
  irish or scots . 
  also , it 's a border city . 
  fun fact : a short drive up the irish side of the border is a lovely little village called [ muff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muff,_county_donegal ) . 
   smart people go to oxbridge no , smart * rich * people go to oxbridge . 
  the tuition fees for cambridge alone , at least for mphil cs , are 18,300 p/a . 
  most students cover a good chunk of that from trust funds or their parents ' savings . 
  places a year are scholarships but there 's still a bit of an air of elitism surrounding them . 
  and cambridge is the * less * `` snobbish '' of the two , being the more science/tech oriented one . 
  only reason i said as much is because the next time - if they do turn back on their word - it might not be so peaceful . 
  the people will be * royally pissed * . 
  depends if wm keep their word . 
  if the whole `` vow '' falls through and nothing changes , this could end up happening all over again . 
  i hope it does n't come to that . 
  ... huh ? 
  [ it says ** no such thing ** ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/313612/scottish_referendum_agreement.pdf ) , does not give a timescale , or any post-referendum anything for that matter . 
   i feel like a lot of people decide based on their feelings ( braveheart and all that ) we are aware that braveheart is a load of hollywood pish that 's factually inaccurate and about as inspiring as getting slapped in the face with a dildo . 
  it has somewhat appropriate quotes though . 
  but that 's about where it ends .

  why do n't you butt in on this topic you have absolutely no fucking say in . 
  uk is an eu member too with its banks holding part of the greek debt . 
  eight times more than yours , in fact . 
  so if anyone should be butting out ... 
  in addition , here we sit at the opposite end of the spectrum , undergoing austerity on a scale not seen since wwii , whilst our economy is in sixth gear and breaking our own records repeatedly for growth . 
  we have every right to comment , thank you very much .

   opposed by the vast majority of scots i would n't be so quick to call it vast . 
  i also should point out [ 14.9 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_in_scotland#2015 ) of the scottish electorate voted tory and they gained one seat ( a bit of a pisstake if you ask me - scotcons are actually much more centrist and small-c conservative than their southern counterpart , and ruth davidson is actually a half decent politician . 
  sometimes . ), 
  50 % of the electorate voted snp . 
  while that is impressive in and of itself , many of those did so with the understanding a second referendum will not be held during this parliament . 
  sturgeon mentioned `` a material change '' is needed in order for a referendum to become viable . 
  to my ears , that means that they need to be * absolutely 100 % certain * they will win the vote . 
  there is a widely-held view in the yes camp that otherwise , if there is a no vote again , `` the dream is dead for good '' and scotland will forever remain part of the uk . 
  scotland needs to prove itself to the world ( and to itself ) in economic terms first , which is why there is a drive here toward devomax and full fiscal autonomy . 
  if a case is made to scotland that it is more than capable of standing on its own two feet fiscally and socially , the case for remaining in the union vanishes entirely and it is at that point independence will become inevitable . 
  but we are realistically looking at 2019 , at least , before we even get the wheels turning on that . 
  i doubt an eu referendum is a strong enough case for many no voters , who bear in mind for the most part belong to a demographic that support it , to bring them round to independence . 
   the parliament will now not accurately represent the people 's voice . 
  it very rarely has since its inception . 
  everyone i talked to in scotland pre-sep 18 was voting yes . 
  look how that went . 
   as an american of northern european ancestry , so , like nearly every other ` merican in existence , then . 
  `` air pillow vehicle '' , assuming it has the same origin as german . 
  are you for real ? 
  i have a significant number family and friends on the continent , and i appreciate the * good * the eu brings us , with regards to things like rights and law . 
  it has its problems , for sure , but nothing insurmountable if people would actually sit down and use their fucking heads for once . 
  i could n't care less about the fiscal aspect . 
  i was on the fence about independence until the very last minute , and voted yes purely because of a ( in hindsight , misguided ) faith that it might put the boot up the old westminster establishment even if the no side won . 
  what . 
  i want the uk to remain in the eu , and i give a shit about democratic process , and want to see electoral reform . 
  the two are not mutually exclusive concepts . 
  yep , unfortunately it 's no longer fit for purpose ( depending on your viewpoint ) but is still used to push an agenda as and when the authorities feel like it . 
  [ homelessness has been illegal since 1824 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vagrancy_act_1824 ), 
  that 's enough for a one bedroom flat in some parts of the country , i 'm not disagreeing with that , the lha here is # 78 a week here iirc . 
  it 's actually getting that flat in the first place which some people struggle with , for various reasons . 
  a 2 year waiting list for social housing for a single male is not just not unheard of , it 's a regular thing . 
  bear in mind also that hb will be withdrawn when a sanction is applied to the main benefit ( jsa/is/esa etc. ), 
  and that many people do n't know that you can reapply for hb a week into the sanction ( in fact , this information is often intentionally withheld by advisors ) and you have a recipe for destitution on your hands . 
  for example : given the above scenario , a claimant gets kicked out of their accomodation , as they were behind on their rent they were classed as `` intentionally homeless '' , and suddenly they are absolute bottom priority for getting into a new council property , with zero recourse , a prohibitively expensive and long appeals process , and even if they win the dwp appeal , that is no help getting back into their council place . 
   we have an advanced enough safety net that if you are homeless you 're doing it , in some form , voluntarily . 
  i can tell you have n't gone anywhere near the uk welfare system in the last half-decade . 
  ( i spent 2 years as a cab volunteer advisor for benefits claimants . ), 
  we did , once . 
  currently , it sets people up to fail . 
  as someone who has worked ** a lot ** with the homeless in the uk , this is the correct answer . 
  pretty much every single last homeless shelter in the entire country is absolutely full to bursting . 
  there might be 25 beds in a shelter , but when there are 40 at the door , you can see the problem . 
  charging is not an issue since service charges are often covered by housing benefit and/or any excess is paid from jsa/is/esa . 
  street beggars , yeah , ok , that 's a different story , maybe less than half are actually genuine , but a vigilant eye can spot the difference between a chancer and someone in genuine need of help . 
  getting social housing , if you do n't have social work support , can take * years * of waiting . 
  so there goes that idea . 
  which leaves squatting , and sleeping rough . 
  how dare you , all hail queen nicola , saor alba gu brath , #indyref 2 , etc.

  the people ? 
  brilliant , i have some very good friends there . 
  they 're very much like the brits , except nicer , and they actually possess a sense of humour . 
  the government ? 
  at least merkel is n't cameron .
