  many ni staff are bum-buddies with the current cabinet . 
  that 's literally all there is to it . 
   so you do n't feel like the uk is your `` home , '' then ? 
  surely , given the fact that you were born and raised in the uk , speak english , and are immersed in our culture and traditions , you 'd feel some sort of preference / loyalty to the uk ? 
  the country that took in your forbears and gave them a chance at a better life ? 
  this nationalistic bullshit is why you 're unwelcome in / r/europe i hear france has some nice cheese to go with your whin -- oh , wait . 
  grow up and deal with with the consequences of your actions , g\u00f2rach . 
  that may be the way it is ; does n't mean every single last one of us has to be happy with it . 
  same goes for the brexit result and the rest of the uk , now i think about it . 
  i lived in walthamstow pre-gentrification and it was absolutely fine . 
  to borrow a friend 's turn of phrase , you feel like a rice krispie in a bowl of coco pops - without meaning to be racist there - and crime is a little higher than average - but by no means was it a no-go zone . 
  by every single account i 've heard - and maybe half my circle of friends comprises londoners - things have gotten better since , not worse . 
  what is a profit margin ? 
  i used to live in essex and it 's one of the most bigoted , hateful , xenophobic , up-its-own arse counties in england . 
  right-wing haven - pretty much every seat is * very * safe conservative - and holds the only ukip commons seat in the uk ( clacton ) . 
  the london edge ( barking/dagenham ) is also edl/bnp heartland . 
  granted , there are some great people in essex too . 
  i made many good friends while i was living there . 
  but , try getting into a conversation into a pub about politics and nine times out of ten some fat bald twat will step in telling you how all these `` fuckin ' pakis and jippos and polish keep taking our jobs away and should speak more english and go back to their own fuckin ' country '' . 
  harlow itself is a predominantly white , working class `` new town '' which readily breeds sentiment like this , especially when unemployment is high and a third of the town falls within the de social demographic . 
  `` you should n't listen to these ` so called experts ' '' from the leave campaign , rather than thinking it was a joke . 
  i literally just read a quote on a certain social network from a leave voter that said , and i quote , `` you remainers are fucking traitors and you all need to be put down '' . 
  not trying to generalise here , because there are a lot of very nice leave voters ( my family being some of them ) but i somehow doubt that his attitude is isolated . 
  that 's nice . 
  still voting remain though . 
  now take your fucking stupid golf courses and piss off . 
  we were undecided before it was cool . 
  too busy eating froyo and drinking craft beers to give a fuck . 
  think american chain food ( tasty but so bad for you ) but made to european standards ( much better for you and generally a lot less processed shite ) . 
  have also yet to find a baked potato better than the first one i ever ate at a cafe ( whose name i forget ) there , 22 years later . 
  not even american , but god i loved ramstein afb ( used to live in landstuhl ) . 
  and i totally agree with the food court being some of the most tasty i have ever eaten . 
  we tried that . 
  it only ended in tears . 
  let 's not forget that good old quote from the old prune himself :  i once asked rupert murdoch why he was so opposed to the european union . 
  ` that 's easy , ' he replied . 
  ` when i go into downing street they do what i say ; when i go to brussels they take no notice . ', 
  it 's funny in a sad way because it 's true . 
   maschinen ( machine ) l\u00e4rmschutz ( noise ) verordnung ( ordnance )  rasenm\u00e4her ( lawnmower ) verordnung ( ordnance ) compound nouns are awesome . 
  english living in scotland . 
  so they 're * technically * correct . 
  i get referred to as engl\u00e4nder , which as i understand is the general term for `` brit '' . 
  so i guess they are synonymous over there , kinda . 
  ** we 're gon na ` stabilize ' the fuck outta you son ** ps it 's `` stabilisation '' get it right, 
   sorry for my ignorance but what does liberal/conservative mean ? 
  are n't these terms supposed to be just the opposite ? 
  they are not mutually exclusive concepts . 
  fucking / r/eyebleach ho ~, 
  for real , this reminds me of bravo fotolovestory if it was written by bald sweaty 40 year old drunk white van men in a pub in the midlands somewhere . 
   two world wars and one world cup in case you forgot what part of reddit you were on , they won four world cups and have the strongest economy in europe , doo dah , doo dah . 
  well , some of us were gon na already , but you 've all gone and royally fucked that one up . 
  rip my right to go and settle and work in another eu country with minimal paperwork . 
  the money comes from a variety of sources , to my knowledge . 
  i know reif comes from central government , i 'll give you that , but five minutes of research seems to suggest much of our renewable energy come from private enterprise as well . 
  saying that , renewable energy policy is n't my area , so ... 
   sean connery takes over as monarch of scotland and all former uk dominions . 
  fuck that . 
  frankie boyle for scottish president pls . 
   make edinburgh great again . 
  we 're already great , we do n't need ya trumpisms here . 
  try #makeglesgabrawagain, 
  our economy is moving away from oil towards renewable and high-tech . 
  we 're no silicon valley but our hardware r&d sector is pretty up there . 
  with that said , i do n't agree that a 2018 referendum is even a remotely good idea , and neither do most of my yes-voting friends , they ( and i ) would much rather see the dust settle over brexit first and see article 50 through to the end . 
  because you never know , hell might freeze over and brexit might be a happy ending . 
  [ you went there . 
  ] ( http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/maurice-moss-eating-popcorn-the-it-crowd.gif ), 
  oh ik  that probably should have been `` some of them '' do n't like gay people ... idk ... you hear a lot of conflicting positions out of them . 
   but here 's hoping that scotland and north ireland will no longer be part of the eu as gb will leave , forcing scotland to have another vote to leave the uk and here hoping that the north and south of ireland and become one island and leave the past where it is , from a scottish perspective , this is what i can see happening too . 
  furthermore i see a request for a binding second referendum shot down by may 's cabinet , but we 'll end up holding it anyway , it 'll ( barely ) come out for yes and then who knows . 
  i think also that once article 50 is rolling and people start to see the cost of living begin to rocket out of control , hardcore no voters will start jumping ship . 
  hell , my own facebook feed has gone from maybe 25 % no to 0 % since brexit and we 're not even in the hard bit yet . 
  regarding the `` refugee issue '' , it 's a powder keg waiting to go off and it just needs the right ( or wrong , depending on your perspective ) mixture to set it off . 
  another couple of terrorist attacks here and a salvo from the dm/sun/express and i can quite easily see things descending into vigilante violence against muslims and refugees . 
  i am totally expecting a 2011 london riots rerun before the next ge . 
  i know we have a stiff upper lip and all but with everything taken into account and the post-brexit divisiveness it looks bleak here . 
   the people said what they want . 
  deal with it . 
  ** democracy ** * n * . 
  an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organisation . 
  36 % of the uk population voted to leave, 
  afd is more like ukip tbh if you think afd is anywhere even close to nsdap you 're a fucking idiot and have n't got the faintest clue about modern german politics yes , they do n't like gay people . 
  yes , they do n't like refugees or asylum seekers . 
  no , they will not shut down democratic process and start committing genocide . 
  prove me wrong . 
  i considered using / r/nazism but it 's pretty derelict . 
  i respecfully disagree . 
  and i 've been here ( lurking , granted , i do n't post much ) for quite a while . 
  i like this sub because you get all sorts , both sides of the debate . 
  even on the subject of immigration , yes , the top level comments can be a bit `` did they just ... '' but then you drill down and see the other side . 
  i also imagine being an overarching `` parent '' sub to many others it gets subject to brigading on that particular subject . 
  but looking at the actual comments as a whole , it 's fairly centrist ; very , very , moderate right at a push . 
  i sit dead centre on the political spectrum so it is nice to have a sub that sits somewhere in between . 
  free market capitalism in three words : adapt or die . 
  ha hahaha ahahahahahhahahaha no . 
  t_d is a far right sub this place ai n't far right by a loooooooooooooooong shot . 
  well , we will see what impact 16 year olds have on our own elections , seeing as the voting age across the board here was recently lowered . 
  i have my doubts the impact will be that great . 
  what point did i mention ending someone 's life ? 
  i would personally be aiming to merely incapacitate or , better yet , use the firearm as a deterrent .
