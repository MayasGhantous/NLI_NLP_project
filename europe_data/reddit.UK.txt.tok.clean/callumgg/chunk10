  thank you . 
  luckily i edited the title so it included the word ` reportedly ' . 
  hopefully the mods or / r/europe can tag this post as false . 
  edit : bbc did pick up on this though - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26410431, 
  looks like it might not be true in the end - http://novosti-n.mk.ua/ukraine_article/read/7609.html i do n't see why you were down voted so much though . 
  i feel like a russian flair ( no matter the stance of the user ) attracts controversy in / r/europe and either garners a lot of up votes or down votes . 
   i call bullshit til its confirmed looks like we know now http://novosti-n.mk.ua/ukraine_article/read/7609.html edit : why am i at minus two for admitting i was wrong ? 
  the risks do n't make it worth lying unless they thought they were telling the truth . 
  this is about a specific and recognisable ship and could be just as easily disproven than proven . 
  edit : http://novosti-n.mk.ua/ukraine_article/read/7609.html, 
  i would n't normally post something directly from the media of a belligerent but it 's not exactly a breaking headline . 
   this pic has been touted as a confirmation by who ? 
  it 's not unreasonable to assume one ship has defected , given that there is a government in transition and captain gelunov is e. ukrainian . 
  edit : thank god i edited the title before i posted so it would have the word ` reportedly ' in http://novosti-n.mk.ua/ukraine_article/read/7609.html, 
  the article addresses that , but also highlights that you ca n't throw out the baby with the bath water ( to borrow a german idiom ) . 
  are you saying that this is a trojan horse ? 
  i 'm pretty sure gelunov ( the captain ) is from e. ukraine . 
  it 's really strange because i was reading about the ukrainian flagship last wednesday on wikipedia because i was bored .

  at the opening ceremony , [ one of these rings was supposed to open but did n't ] ( http://abcnewsradioonline.com/storage/news-images/getty_020714_olympicringfail.jpg?__squarespace_cacheversion=1391795789442 ) . 
  they changed the closing ceremony to reflect that as a bit of a joke . 
  prior to the midcentury they did represent different continents , but this was removed because they were n't sure if this was the original intention . 
  also the small circle would 've been the americas . 
  see / u/jackblack2323 's comment here - http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1yqu04/four_olympic_rings_appear_at_the_sochi_closing/cfn8ij8, 
  the cossacks too , who whipped the girls , are separate from the state of russia . 
  would be interesting to see what levada comes out with post-sochi . 
  these walls are more of a ` just in case ' sort of thing . 
  the gates are open throughout the day , no checkpoints last time i went through . 
  the greater divide is the transport system , which goes into the city centre from everywhere but not across the different communities . 
  if i want to go from malone road to the village by bus i need to go to city hall first . 
  did n't want to give it away , it was a relief for me when i saw they made it and i thought i could share that with others - not just the facts but a story we could invest our emotions in . 
   the belief that europe 's states have been undermined by a sovereignty-trumping eu has become as popular as it is inaccurate , argues ada regelmann . 
  the real threat lies in these states ' inability to capitalize on the benefits of political integration in what is fast becoming an interdependent world . 
  it 's called a ` request page ' , [ see the wiki here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/passport#the_request_page ), 
  i do n't know about venezuela , but russia 's corruption is fairly consistent with other middle-income countries . 
  lower/middle income countries like russia are more susceptible to corruption - http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/centers-programs/centers/cid/publications/faculty/wp/145.pdf, 
  here 's some more cherrypicked graphs which could help form a greater context - http://imgur.com/a/da2wd, 
  xpost / r/foreignpolicyanalysis  europeans had two remarkable foreign-policy successes in 2013 . 
  in april , high representative catherine ashton announced an agreementthat should settle the most difficult and dangerous of the problems between belgrade and prishtina . 
  the agreement , the product of difficult talks facilitated by the european union that began in 2011 , paves the way for serbia to begin accession talks with the eu and for kosovo to take an important step down the same path . 
  in november , the new iranian government and the e3 +3 agreed to pause the activities the other side found problematic -- enrichment on the one hand and sanctions on the other -- and to take some initial steps back in each area . 
  the interim deal opens the real prospect of a solution to the issue of iran 's nuclear programme without military action -- an objective that europeans , led by the e3 of france , germany , and the uk , have pursued since 2002 . 
  in the case of kosovo , the most important steps have been taken ; for iran the major work lies ahead . 
  but in both cases europe made huge progress in 2013 towards achieving its long-term objectives . 
    in part because of these two high-profile successes , europe 's overall foreign-policy performance ranked significantly higher than in 2012 , a year in which there were some signs of stabilisation and resilience after two difficult years dominated by the euro crisis , and the foundations were laid for this year 's successes . 
  the neighbourhood continued to present complex challenges -- in particular , the conflict in syria worsened even further and the eu had a high-profile setback when the ukrainian government decided not to sign an association agreement with the eu . 
  europeans were also divided among themselves on issues such as the dispute with china over solar panels . 
  nevertheless , 2013 was a good year compared to the previous three . 
  there was improvement in performance on relations with china ( from c + to b - ) , wider europe ( from c + to b - ) , and the middle east and north africa ( from c + to b - ) . 
  on the other hand , europe performed worse than in 2012 on relations with russia , and on multilateral issues and crisis management . 
  perhaps sochi is an opportunity ? 
  also , ca n't say depardieu and le pen 's support for russia helped its image in france . 
  yes i definitely undervalue events like kosovo , georgia etc. 
  how do you think the eu could make a more consistent foreign policy , and what steps do you think russia can take to achieve a less ` cold ' appearance to eu citizens ? 
  or do you think russia will have to wait until it has more progressive values ( e.g. 
  gay rights etc. ), 
  what aggressive stance , can you give some examples ? 
  here 's a very brief and simplistic timeline of russia 's relationship with the west under putin and medvedev 's early presidency : * between 2000-2 , putin pursued an aspirational pro-western policy trying to join the club . 
  however , the predominance of russian conservatives and lack of consensus prevented this from becoming definitive and consistent . 
  putin went against opinion in the ( russian ) security council to join the us-led anti-terrorism campaign . 
  * putin at the start of his presidency made some piecemeal attempts at cooperation with europe , but was more focused on america . 
  this was not rewarding - the us did not withdraw from the abm ( anti-ballistic missiles ) treaty , nato continually expanded east and the domestic view of russia as a junior partner coupled with anti-american sentiment meant electoral suicide . 
  russia became more internationally focused , as opposed to regionally and putin even discussed establishing a russian base in libya . 
  * relations with the us deteriorated when chirac , schroeder and putin 's foreign ministers signed a declaration against the us invasion of iraq . 
  the statement meant they would block the un security council from authorising force in iraq . 
  this was a challenge to us hegemony and the ` special relationship ' that putin had cultivated with bush . 
  putin had ( at this point ) always been pro-west , and he had to choose between two divisive factions as a result of the iraq war . 
  he picked those against ( ` the peace camp ' ) as he felt he had more in common with the europeans -- they favoured a multi-polar world . 
  * the move to europe signalled economic over security policies . 
  much more trade between eu & russia than russia and the us , with potential for more markets . 
  * medvedev was much more focused on emerging economies and the brics than europe , which shows that the eu would have to be much more proactive to make similar gains ( although medvedev shares more international norms/views etc. 
  with european leaders ) . 
  * i 'm getting a bit carried away here , so i 'll just make the point that russia is marginalised in europe and does n't want to be . 
  part of the point of this article is highlighting how the eu can lever this , e.g. 
  with visa free travel . 
  yes it 's good to remember , and it 's * definitely * exaggerated . 
  chicken noodle news at best . 
  xpost / r/foreignpolicyanalysis  it is time for a fundamental rethink of the eu 's russia policy . 
  brussels needs to take moscow 's eurasian project seriously , and it must decide what kind of relationship it wants with russia in the short and longer term as well as whether -- and how -- this is achievable . 
  edit : if anyone is interested in this and near brussels on thursday - http://eu-russia-csf.org/newsdetail/article/889.html?l=1%3b&amp;chash=7454f7d12568878188c5f09a6c2983a3, 
  he also said that ` whoever wants the soviet union back has no brain ' . 
  it 's also worth noting what the word geopolitical means and why putin uses that specific word . 
  the soviet union 's collapse led to the 1990s in russia , economic collapse , mafia/oligarch control , threatening security environment , nato encirclement . 
  i can imagine maybe helmut kohl saying something similar about the gdr , if the strong capitalist west had n't been so successful at integrating the east . 
  in fact , merkel came from the gdr iirc , so [ this wiki page may help explain what i 'm trying to say ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostalgie ) :  next to nostalgia for everyday aspects of life , ` ostalgie ' was also inspired by the absence of unemployment and poverty in the gdr . 
  indeed , ostalgie could be inspired by the longing of the ossis ( german for `` easterners '' , a term for former gdr citizens ) for the social system and the sense of community of the gdr . 
  when the renowned west-german magazine der spiegel asked former gdr-inhabitants whether the gdr `` had more good sides than bad sides '' , 57 % of them answered yes . 
  to the statement of the interviewing journalist that `` gdr inhabitants did not have the freedom to travel wherever they wanted '' , germans replied that `` present-day low-wage workers do not have that freedom either '' . 
  [ 2 ] one last point is that putin 's main opposition is the communist party , and he often attempts to play ( contradictory ? ), 
  roles to different people - secular and liberal moderniser to some , ` father ' figure protecting the russian welfare state to others . 
  how are russia 's homophobic laws different from [ margaret thatcher 's section 28 ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/section_28 ) let 's also not forget the fact that homosexuality in the roi was only decriminalised after pressure from the echr ( something opposed early on by the domestic courts ) . 
  russia is backwards , it 's a middle ( not high ) income country , and it 's having a fundamentalist religious resurgence . 
  but let 's make distinctions between ignorant/homophobic/regressive laws , and a state that wants to ** kill ** homosexuals . 
  you ca n't edit a title after you click post , my own fault for not reading over before . 
  also you ca n't delete a post unless you 're a moderator , you can only disassociate your username with it . 
  clicked the suggest title because i could n't be bothered copy and pasting and it came up with something rather average , the main title on the actual page is '' * hidden homophobia : is germany really as liberal as it seems ? 
  * '' which is a lot better imo .
