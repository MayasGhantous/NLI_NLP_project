  well , i 'm pretty sure they do n't learn the imperfect subjunctive in english schools at any rate . 
  i just got the impression amongst the younger generation that english was seen as ` cool ' . 
  having lived in belfast , it 's not so bad , you can even understand the ` culchies ' and ` spides ' if they do n't mumble * too * much whilst talking too fast . 
  there probably are n't comparable statistics , but i 'm not sure of that . 
  i think the ones in grey are the ones that do n't have comparable systems in place to test english proficiency , as english is the first language of the uk and ireland , it makes sense that their tests wo n't be comparable with the continent . 
  this is probably the same for the other greyed out countries , that they do n't have comparable statistics . 
  so france is getting worse ? 
  that skews my impressions . 
  you do n't give the address to anyone but the person who is sending you the parcel . 
  and thanks , i should include that next time as well , though the impression i got in the uk was that notepads are used for the writing pads ( loose leaf in american ) and notebooks for the ` books ' / ` cahier ' ( e.g the exercise books in school ) . 
  ( edit : around 10 % of those signed up so far are from the uk if you 're interested ), 
  / r/republicanism for the republic !, 
  or maybe freedom house is n't the best source to use . 
   according to who ? 
  american government ? 
  freedom house is funded by the american government , but is not strictly part of it . 
  i can understand your criticisms though :  daniel treisman , a ucla political scientist , has criticised freedom house 's assessment of russia . 
  treisman has pointed out that freedom house ranks russia 's political rights on the same level as the united arab emirates , which , according to freedom house , is a federation of absolute monarchies with no hint of democracy anywhere in the system . 
   freedom house also ranks russia 's civil liberties on the same scale as those of yemen . 
  in yemen , according to the constitution , sharia law is the only source of legislation , and allows assaults and killings of women for alleged immoral behaviour . 
  criticising the president is illegal in yemen . 
   treisman contrasts freedom house 's ranking with the polity iv scale used by academics and in which russia has a much better score . 
  in the polity iv scale , saudi arabia is a consolidated autocracy ( -10 ) , while the united states is a consolidated democracy ( +10 ) ; russia has a score of +4 , while united arab emirates has a score of -8 . 
  edit : i would also add ukraine , turkey , and israel ( why are they yellow ) to treisman 's ` what-about ' list . 
  it 's over , saakashvili lost . 
  ivanishvili 's man ( more pro-russian ) won , forgot his name . 
   i do n't really see the need i 'm pro-europe , but i 'd see the need for a ` safe space ' . 
  they 'd still probably be hanging out here , but if they get tired of seeing dissenting opinions downvoted out of visibility then they have their own club to share sceptic articles etc. 
   when russia or china decides to intervene somewhere they usually do n't ask for un approval when was the last time china intervened without un approval ? 
  what about russia ? 
  the russian state did n't even exist until recently as well . 
  it was the isn 's editorialisation on their facebook page , sorry . 
  i should have added that in my original comment . 
  stable does n't mean peaceful though , nor does it mean ` more unstable than before ' , and the international system is still characterised by anarchy . 
  i do see your point but international relations is still anarchic though , and unstable . 
  x-post / r/foreignpolicyanalyis  daniel keohane is convinced that the european union needs to develop a new and cohesive foreign policy strategy . 
  but what are the chances of this happening ? 
  pretty slim , especially when you take into account the deep divisions that exist between france , germany and the uk over defense priorities . 
   you made me chuckle , i 'll carry on though !, 
  you 're not too late for the [ notebook relay then ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/notebooks/comments/1n6pix/notebook_relay_sign_up/ ) , sign up is closing soon .

  yep there was a good part of a documentary i saw which was quite insightful for me - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey2fgx6dhcc nowhere else in britain would get worked up over the ` flegs ' issue , or take such an offense at a foreign flag . 
  what is the point ? 
  people in gibraltar and the falkland islands often call themselves british , the distinction is that they 're culturally british but not geographically , same as the people in ni ( though this is [ debatable ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles_naming_dispute ) ) . 
  spooky : s. thanks for the comprehensive response . 
  they should 've told that to ian paisley , would 've saved a lot of lives . 
  ah , i should have read the whole article ( or at least searched ` northern ireland ' ) . 
  thanks , 
  you go tell that to anyone in sandy row then , a lot of people in ni identify as british . 
  there are people there who identify as irish too though . 
  the bbc must have some foregone conclusions about northern ireland to have not included them then . 
  is there anything linking the actual russian government to that , or do pissed off individuals count ? 
   utedass i googled that , and this came up - http://static.nytrendo.com/picture/21-mobilt-utedass.jpg, 
   ill keep the city and watch the standard of living boom in the south and you guys can live in your grey wet socialist utopia .

  just in case people read your comment but miss the joke  ... 
  the swiss are very much for their neutrality , and see it as an aspect of their statehood , this is supposedly related to their call for greater self-reliance and autonomy . 
  * however * , there are differing schools of thoughts in switzerland that have ` strong ' opinions on what type of neutrality switzerland should have : * traditionalists , who would want greater autonomy and isolation to some extent . 
  * advocates of `` integral neutrality '' , who would not be against bilateral treaties with other nations for economic interests , but against a treaty with something like the eu , in order to preserve their freedom , sovereignty etc. 
  * advocates of `` active neutrality '' , who would be for significantly greater participation and cooperation in world politics ( even if it means less autonomy/sovereignty ) . 
  x-post / r/foreignpolicyanalysis and / r/europeans  this article talks about the background to swiss neutrality and how it is an important part of swiss identity today . 
  i 'm at qub , i met him a few times . 
  born in london , but * strongly * identify with russia . 
  londoner first , ethnic russian second ; this sounds so pretentious writing it . 
  basil mccrea seems like a nice guy , you just need a decent politician in government . 
  the urals and the caucasus mountain ranges are generally seen as the border between europe and asia , so maybe ` just next to ' would have been more accurate , but the inaccuracy makes for a better title . 
  especially because you 're already given so much in the first place , at least in my experience of polish weddings . 
  if anybody is curious about the homeopathy thing , it 's a reference to the british prince charles : http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/hes-at-it-again-prince-charles-accused-of-lobbying-health-secretary-over-homeopathy-8723145.html, 
  yes you 're right the first paragraph is :  king willem-alexander delivered a message to the dutch people from the government in a nationally televised address : the welfare state of the 20th century is gone . 
  the article is focusing on the irony of using the king as a messenger . 
  x-post / r/republicanism  youngest monarch in europe says people must take responsibility for their own future and create their own social and financial safety nets ...  king willem-alexander delivered a message to the dutch people from the government in a nationally televised address : the welfare state of the 20th century is gone . 
  ...  the king said tuesday some costs for the care of the elderly , for youth services , and for job retraining after layoffs will now be pushed back to the local level , in order to make them better tailored to local circumstances . 
   the king earns an annual salary of around 825,000 euros ( $ 1.1 million ) , though maintaining the royal house -- castles , parades and all -- costs the government more than 100 million euros annually . 
  there 's at least one person who should be cut off from welfare before all the poor people , in my opinion . 
   it 'll take decades until the ( completely natural ) contrarian reaction to nearly half a century of indoctrination wears off and we can reassess the narratives . 
  how do you think this will ever change , given the colonialism of the soviet union and its association with russia ? 
  will young estonians just forget about this ? 
  you do n't think something like this - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night - is part of it ? 
  when identities and national myths conflict , people are going to be upset :  many ethnic estonians considered the bronze soldier in the city centre a symbol of soviet occupation and repression . 
  [ 2 ] at the same time the monument has significant symbolic value to estonia 's russian community , symbolising not only soviet victory over nazi germany in world war ii , but also their claim to equal rights in estonia . 
  [ 3 ] edit : ** it says the same thing in the infographic above , i 'm not even taking sides on who is right , i 'm just pointing out that estonia no longer being under a repressive communist regime is not why the majority of russians ( who are mainly capitalist ) do not like estonia . 
  ** ^ ( or maybe you 're just downvoting me for my flair ), 
  do you mind sharing it ? 
  [ the new york times ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/world/europe/russian-polling-group-says-it-may-close.html?_r=1&amp; ) seems to rank it fairly well . 
  i do n't really get the hate with levada . 
  even from the kremlin in fact , [ forbes ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2013/05/21/the-russian-governments-no-good-awful-really-really-bad-decision-to-target-the-levada-center/ ) magazine did a good run down of why the government should make an exception of cracking down on it as a ` foreign agent ' . 
  i could n't resist changing the title , sorry . 
   the two men in their twenties stood in line to buy beer at a local store on sunday in russia 's rostov-on-don after the city 's anniversary celebration . 
  they were discussing kant 's philosophical ideas . 
   the discussion turned into a heated debate , which was followed by a fistfight and then one of the debaters pulled out a nonlethal pistol and fired at the other 's head . 
  that reminds me of the bluebell forest in kew ( london ) : http://www.kew.org/ucm/images/getimage/kppcont_032656?rendition=main http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/queen_charlotte's_cottage,_kew_gardens_-_geograph.org.uk_-_40670.jpg, 
   interesting that nature never seemed to have taken over , i.e. , covering it with flora and fauna . 
  it 's definitely one of a kind . 
  according to this http://www.best-of-european-union.eu/2011/05/27/bledow-desert-a-unique-desert-area-in-central-europe-poland/ it did take over but people settled the area and the thin layer of soil was lost . 
  i did notice , for the record the finnish wikipedia agrees with me about [ russia in europe ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurooppa ) :p . also , ` russification ' was n't exclusive to the 1900s onwards , a crucial part of colonisation has always been to assimilate at least a part of the native population , even now there is hybridity in places like belarus and ukraine . 
  also , you said that europe is a different culture from russia , but when i mentioned the europeanisation of russia you say it does n't count because the rest of europe was n't russified ?? 
   was n't this characterised as `` sleeping bear awakening '' ? 
  i do n't know , sorry . 
   it was seen in the traditional area of europe `` diminishing '' , not russia entering it as a new player is this taught in finland ?
