  i 'm just curious , as it 's not in w. europe . 
   true , but then , so was usa  good point haha . 
  an argument could be made that the us is ethnically and culturally european , but a world away !, 
   and this preserving of the true faith was a large reason why the interaction with the heretical catholic/protestant faiths of europe were so few . 
  it was believed there was very little to learn from the unfaithful ; due to which peter 's actions were so trastic . 
  do you think this may have been two-way ? 
  western europe always saw russia as a ` mystical ' country because of its distance . 
  do n't forget lorne sausage , neeps , and tatties . 
  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/section_28 of the local government act 1988 if anyone 's interested :  the amendment stated that a local authority `` shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality '' or `` promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship '' . 
  it was replaced in 2003 , so we only have to wait a decade or two for russia to do the same perhaps . 
   meanwhile russia was always just hanging on the sidelines , intentionally staying out of european affairs and cultural advancements . 
  it was n't really hanging on the sidelines , it was pushing further into europe , violently at a lot of times . 
  europeanisation occurred heavily through the 1600s and 1700s with highlights being : introducing the julian calendar , changing the alphabet , recruited top scientists and foreign workers , and of course , built russia 's new capital ( st. petersburg ) deliberately close to ( and modelled on ) the europe of the time . 
  additionally , territory acquired in modern day estonia , latvia , and finland , brought russia closer to the trade routes of central and western europe . 
  after this , russia was intricately linked with european affairs , far from shying away . 
  russia was a major player in the two world wars and the napoleonic wars , as well as being the harbinger of communism ( which took over half of europe and created a divide to this day ) . 
  lastly , much of the traditional rus empire and traditions are based on those handed down from constantinople , and you can see them today mainly in religious iconography . 
  russia is * sometimes * described as the being the ` third rome ' , after ivan iii married his way into the byzantine royals , and highlighted his country 's faith to the byzantine religion of orthodoxy . 
  it 's not contiguous . 
  also , there is a distinction made between the m\u00e9tropole and the overseas france ( i do n't know the name for that ) . 
  i 've heard of brewdog definitely , the campaign for real ale made a difference too . 
  london pride seem to be doing well also . 
  coming from london , caring about craft beer is often seen as a ` posh ' thing to do . 
  i have no evidence of this but anecdotal though . 
  as a mod of / r/foreignpolicyanalysis i 'd love to see someone sum up their country 's foreign policy every week . 
  maybe that counts as an interest too specific though . 
  i think shroomum means something like / r/russia or / r/unitedkingdom . 
  even / r/armenia exists and is half active . 
  will do , i may also post it on / r/foreignpolicyanalysis if it 's any good !, 
  russia gains nothing from invading the baltics , especially seeing as it would provoke a huge war . 
  i 'm writing my dissertation on russian foreign policy , and invading the baltics is not a big theme . 
  also , zhirinovsky does not have any power over russia 's foreign policy . 
  the current ruling party and its leaders favour economic cooperation over military invasion . 
  zhirinvosky often makes promises that do not end up being fulfilled : * he [ offered to sell the kurile islands to japan for $ 50 billion . 
  ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/667745.stm ) * he said that [ the 2013 meteor in russia was an american superweapon ] ( http://rt.com/politics/zhirinovsky-meteorite-american-weapon-316/ ) . 
  * he also famously threatened to use russia 's nuclear weapons to take back alaska ( an american state ) . 
  * there are lots of others . 
  good overview of him here - http://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/politics-and-society/vladimir-zhirinovsky/, 
  it seems they are updating this article as more information gets in . 
  when i posted it , there were just two paragraphs . 
  the result is interesting because , even though [ navalny said a runoff would be unavoidable ] ( http://russialist.org/russian-opposition-activist-sees-putins-remarks-as-good-sign/ ) , navalny actually got higher results than what the polls said he would ( which is unusual ) . 
  [ see here for the polls before the results came in ] ( http://www.levada.ru/01-09-2013/rezultaty-predvybornogo-oprosa-v-moskve ) ( navalny is \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u041d\u0410\u0412\u0410\u041b\u042c\u041d\u042b\u0419 and the incumbent , now victor , is \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u041e\u0411\u042f\u041d\u0418\u041d ) . 
  the actual results were 51 % for sobyanin and 27 % for navalny compared to 58 and 18 , respectively . 
  edit : [ the guardian had an article on this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/08/russia-opposition-mayoral-candidates-vladimir-putin ) , which says that :  election observers in moscow reported numerous minor violations . 
  in the runup to the election , analysts predicted that falsifying votes cast from home ( citizens can request electoral workers to make home visits ) would be the most likely method of cheating , but the percentage of such votes was reportedly small . 
  i doubt this happened , as the moscow mayoral elections have been comparatively squeaky clean in recent years , and there is no real incentive to falsify results when the lead is over 20 points . 
  i 'm sure i 've confused the two at some point as well !, 
  maybe / u/rensch meant romania , which is just slightly smaller than the uk ? 
  ` one of the largest ' may be an exaggeration , but it would be in the top 10 or thereabouts . 
  so remarks that `` could n't be verified '' according to the article itself by a man called dmitry peskov apparently represent russia ? 
  you 're all falling for a sensationalist title that only serves to further divide europe . 
  and why , because russia has a lower gross domestic product than britain ? 
  a few blogposts and articles in exile ( d ) magazine do n't count as common knowledge . 
  the lpdr was the first opposition group to be registered as a party , there were no other oppositionist parties before them . 
  similarly , there is no secret jew who leads the anti-semitic proletariat away from nationalist groups . 
  let 's not forget that parties and individuals as diverse as ur and navalny count themselves as nationalist . 
  he also does not deny jewish blood in his family tree , but does not identify as a jew . 
  i 'd love to believe that people do n't hold opinions like zhirinovksy 's , and that it 's all just a kremlin conspiracy , but do you have any evidence apart from what your parents said ? 
  i 've met bigots in northern ireland , and they were polite , and one of the most eloquent and perceptive individuals i ever met was an italian fascist . 
  why make the distinction between soviet and russian designed reactors , and the reactors from everyone else ? 
  it seems rather outdated in my opinion . 
   the power of informal networks and the weakness of formal institutions in russia have been widely noted . 
  but the nature of the informal deals and personalised loyalties that russian leaders use to mobilise support and maintain control has proved harder to grasp . 
  well said , you 've turned me around on this one . 
  i 'd rather everyone in the year got to see auschwitz or belzec rather than 20 people getting to sit on a beach at sopot as well , 
  such a waste to only see auschwitz , given the cultural value of the rest of poland . 
  this is coming from the grandson of holocaust survivors by the way . 
  x-post / r/foreignpolicyanalysis  angela merkel and the then russian president , dmitri medvedev , met in june 2010 ... and produced a half-page memorandum on security issues [ which ] supported the establishment of an eu-russian dialogue at the foreign-minister level and of eu-russian cooperation on crisis management . 
   neither side could deliver on these commitments . 
  that outcome was the product of mixed signals and misjudgment . 
  normally , russians and germans have a firm understanding of the other 's mentality . 
  yet during the meseberg meeting , each side misread the other , seemingly through `` mirroring '' -- ascribing to the other its own analytical framework . 
   german prosecutors are probing how a man was able to board an empty government jet used by chancellor angela merkel . 
  wearing only underpants and high on drugs , he danced on a wing , sprayed foam around and pushed cockpit buttons . 
  funny old world . 
  x-post / r/republicanism  prince charles should not have staff working in the civil service if he believes in `` royal political neutrality '' , a prominent labour mp has said . 
    mps are to raise the matter in the house of commons after it emerged that two aides working for the heir to the throne have been seconded to two whitehall departments . 
    one was sent to the cabinet office for two years , while another worked in the department for environment , food and rural affairs for 14 months . 
    according to the sunday times , some of the ministers working in these departments did not know about the appointments . 
    paul flynn , labour mp for newport west , said the secondments suggested the prince was a `` constitutional crisis in waiting '' . 
    `` planting his civil service moles proves [ an ] intention to abandon royal political neutrality , '' he said . 
   ...  `` it raises constitutional questions about the influence the monarch-in-waiting has over policy and there will be questions in the house when it returns . '', 
  ( paul farrelly , labour mp ) . 
   im slow when coming up with ideas i can sympathise , and i moderate a few smallish subreddits so coming up with these ideas is a duty !, 
  i actually saw this and my first reaction was `` that 's a great idea '' , and i only realised that the round table series happened halfway through my comment . 
  i think they decide the topics on irc ( http://webchat.snoonet.org/?nick=&amp;channels=europe ), 
  like this - http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1j9ntt/series_round_table_week_2_eu_foreign_policy_on/ ? 
  i have n't heard about any countries offering asylum save from canada . 
  if they do , i 'd hope that asylum is offered to people being oppressed for their sexuality in countries like jamaica , uganda , saudi arabia , iran , etc. 
  too or i 'd see it as political points scoring ( or preferential treatment of white europeans ) . 
  only problem is that the law is about `` homosexual propaganda to children '' , and can be both applied and ignored selectively . 
  there are a lot of lgbt groups in russia , something that has n't changed since the law . 
  i 'm hoping the law will turn out to be like britain 's section 20a in 1988 - never properly implemented . 
  russia 's constitution still upholds equal treatment of different sexualities ( for now ) , but all that means is that a heterosexual will be given the same sentence as a homosexual for ` spreading gay propaganda ' to children . 
  that was my first thought because of the polonium , but litvinenko was just a former spy , and seemed kind of ` below ' the affairs of a state . 
  yes but the ussr was an extremely oppressive state that put millions in forced labour/concentration camps , it 's a very politically charged comparison to make . 
  not going to deny that , but the ussr has bad connotations though , with all the repression , millions of people in gulags etc. 
  you should try changing the text in your flair to whatever you identify with/talk about the most here , that 's what i did . 
   highlight their aggression towards former soviet states could you expand on this ? 
  additionally , i get more upvotes in / r/europe than most other subs too , and i think unclesneakyfinger 's comments are downvoted for other reasons .
