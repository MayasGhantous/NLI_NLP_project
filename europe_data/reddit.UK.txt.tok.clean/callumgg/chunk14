  sort by controversial on their userpage and you 'll see [ rape advocacy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/14j76u/reddit_if_you_could_freeze_time_for_5_minutes/c7dlhp6?context=3 ) , [ bitterness against the french ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/18gezy/a_man_burns_himself_to_death_outside_a_job_centre/c8enizc?context=3 ) and [ europeans in general ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/15v2p9/switzerland_gunman_kills_three_in_daillon/c7q2qlc?context=3 ) , [ trying ( but failing ) to shame angela merkel for being a prude ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1k1cm3/whose_line_is_it_anyway_reurope_edition/cbkdd8j?context=3 ) , and of course [ the uk 's welfare system ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1k1cm3/whose_line_is_it_anyway_reurope_edition/cbkdd8j?context=3 ) . 
  my guess is that their views are n't exactly one with the ` hivemind ' of / r/europe . 
  i 've been upvoted plenty of times here explaining things from a russian perspective , countless times more so than in somewhere like / r/worldnews or / r/politics where there exists a genuine russophobia . 
  like this ?

  thanks for letting me know , and hope you stick around !, 
  do you mean yushchenko ? 
  [ he claimed that zhvania was the one who poisoned him ] ( http://blog.cleveland.com/pdextra/2008/07/ukraine_president_blames_forme.html ) , and some people said that there 's no evidence yuschenko was [ poisoned anyway ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viktor_yushchenko#dioxin_poisoning_allegations ) also , it was dioxin , which i 'm pretty sure is just a regular poison and not radioactive like polonium ( i was never too good at chemistry though so feel free to correct ) . 
   the euro zone 's economy has finally begun to grow again , thanks largely to strong second-quarter performances by both germany and france . 
  even portugal got into the act , with the strongest performance of all in the single currency area . 
   putin is trying to recreate the ussr more or less putin is n't a communist , a ` neo-stalinist ' , or an irredentist . 
  he 's authoritarian , and dependent on stability , economic growth , and public perceptions ; unlikely to try and recreate the former soviet union . 
  even zyuganov does n't want that i 'm sure . 
   it is n't just putin but the general swing in russia towards poisoning foreign leaders is this meant literally ? 
   using oil like a political weapon i do see your point here , but do n't give credit to putin for being the only person to use resources for leverage . 
   sending tanks over the border i 'm guessing you mean in s. ossetia ? 
  what would the uk have done though if attacked - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8281990.stm, 
   simply put men like putin make russia dangerous and legitimise a renewed containment strategy why ? 
  i do realise that people who boycott russian vodka do n't think in ir/geopolitical terms , but i think treisman is more addressing those that call for the governments to boycott . 
  for me , i think that governments should be pragmatic in their aims , or they will find it harder to achieve them . 
  also there 's the argument that boycotting the entire country turns russians against homosexuals , inciting hatred in an indirect way . 
  for the olympics , i think it would be a great example for lgbt in russia for there to be openly gay and successful athletes as role models present , something that would be lost if they decided not to go . 
  think back to the black athletes in hitler 's olympics for example . 
  i think the distinction is of what the government believes and what the russian people believe . 
  the whole pussy riot thing , for example , was seen as blasphemy/offense rather than a matter of free speech , i think the charlie gilmore cenotaph case would be comparable . 
  they also called gay rights an ` insignificant thing '  :(, 
  x-post / r/foreignpolicyanalysis the real title is actually '' * the wrong way to punish putin : how to pressure moscow without boosting the kremlin and alienating russians * '' , but foreign affairs is using this alternative title as well on social media . 
   given putin 's political vulnerability , a showdown with the west over gay rights or edward snowden -- inevitable in light of washington 's cancellation of a u.s.-russian presidential summit -- is exactly what the kremlin wants . 
  the west should narrow its criticism of russia to issues where its views line up with those of the russian people . 
  on a side note , how is the boycott of stoli seen in latvia ? 
   but i 've got to ask - surely these sort of acts become catalysts ? 
  or at least motivators for as you say - less controversial gay rights activists to take stand ? 
  public opinion is pretty firmly against homosexuality , and this is across the political spectrum - http://www.gayrussia.eu/en/russia/2929/ i just do n't know who it would be , maybe medvedev will surprise us , he has gone against putin before . 
  yes , just like navalny and his ` ethnic chauvinism ' . 
  it shows that people are n't black and white in terms of morals . 
  even lech walesa is - http://politicaldeficit.com/2013/03/08/lech-walesa-the-homophobe-reactionary-revolutionary/, 
  the voting ratio is ` fuzzed ' , if your refresh the page it will probably change . 
  the end result ( -21 atm ) is the most accurate , but even that changes randomly . 
  this is all to stop people from ` gaming ' reddit . 
   or am i being young and na\u00efve ? 
  [ not sure if you recognise this law from 1980s uk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/section_28 ) ? 
  i do n't think you 're being na\u00efve , but the change needs to come within , there 's a longstanding suspicion of foreigners , maybe we just need less controversial gay rights activists ( navalny etc. 
  are n't exactly popular ) . 
  the table only seems to count citizenship , en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_estonia, 
  that might explains why estonia is so high . 
  ethnic russians that lived in estonia had to pass a language test in estonian to become citizens . 
  having said that , i have heard it has become a lot easier since then , and is becoming easier still . 
  for the record i agree with you , especially when concerning hereditary rule !, 
  money can promote unity , a common identity , or even a political figure like the queen on uk banknotes , it 's important to use that space wisely . 
  that 's fine , but it 's not antisemitism to not want the flag up there . 
  also i think that makes you a 3g , my family were in be\u0142\u017cec and auschwitz btw . 
  yes , but in certain neighbourhoods it can be a big problem . 
  the treatment of woman in palestine is n't the same across the board too , hebron is a lot more conservative than bethlehem for example . 
  http://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2013/06/23/jewish_women_battle_discrimination_in_israel_siddiqui.html so segregation , only husbands can divorce , general discrimination etc. 
  probably mostly the orthodox/ultra-orthodox jews though . 
   the upcoming sept. 8 regional elections across russia will be more competitive than the previous ones , amid declining public support for the pro-kremlin united russia party , experts say . 
  i have family in israel , and am a 3g holocaust survivor myself , i still do n't want the flag up there . 
  there is no antisemitism in not wanting the flag there . 
  it reminds me of the ' * yes , minister * ' sketch ( the bbc took the youtube video down ) :  sir humphrey : minister , britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last five hundred years : to create a disunited europe . 
  in that cause we have fought with the dutch against the spanish , with the germans against the french , with the french and italians against the germans , and with the french against the germans and italians . 
  divide and rule , you see . 
  why should we change now , when it 's worked so well ? 
   hacker : that 's all ancient history , surely ? 
    sir humphrey : yes , and current policy . 
  we ` had ' to break the whole thing [ the eec ] up , so we had to get inside . 
  we tried to break it up from the outside , but that would n't work . 
  now that we 're inside we can make a complete pig 's breakfast of the whole thing : set the germans against the french , the french against the italians , the italians against the dutch . 
  the foreign office is terribly pleased ; it 's just like old times . 
    hacker : but surely we 're all committed to the european ideal ? 
    sir humphrey : [ chuckles ] really , minister . 
    hacker : if not , why are we pushing for an increase in the membership ? 
    sir humphrey : well , for the same reason . 
  it 's just like the united nations , in fact ; the more members it has , the more arguments it can stir up , the more futile and impotent it becomes . 
    hacker : what appalling cynicism . 
    sir humphrey : yes ... we call it diplomacy , minister . 
  https://www.facebook.com/conservativesforarepublic as an example one of the main core beliefs of conservatism is in an idealist meritocracy , where the hardest working and best skilled have the liberty to achieve what they want in society . 
  modern conservatism may have drifted away from this principle from time to time , but thatcher best sums it up by saying she does n't `` know anyone who has gotten to the top without hard work '' . 
  i 'd say in some ways it 's more conservative to want a non hereditary head of state than it is left . 
  look at states on the extreme left such as north korea and the former soviet union for example . 
  edit : ** yep , downvote me as soon as i reply , why did you bother asking anyway ? 
  i went into two or so threads before bed . 
  if i hold a strong opinion i comment . 
  propaganda is n't the right word , if someone agrees with me , they agree with me , if someone does n't they often act snarky and down vote . 
   tourism has there ever been any proof of this ? 
  people wo n't go to saudi arabia if the head of state is unelected , regardless of the ` cultural heritage ' lost . 
   estates the profit from the duchies go straight to the royal family , if you 're talking about the crown estate it is part of the government not the monarchy - http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/about-us/  a child is born today a few hours old and it 's already being harassed by paparazzi , and denied a choice in the way it lives its life . 
  maybe one of the other 1,983 new babies born today would 've actually * wanted * to have been head of state . 
  how would it be in russia 's interests to invade georgia ? 
  even if saakashvili still had power i would n't see the point . 
  also , `` russian populace is made to feel endangered by the really small countries . 
  chechnya , georgia and also estonia '' where are you getting this from ? 
  it 's been going that way since they lost the whole `` independent from influence '' banner after lebedev bought the paper . 
  ok now i understand , thank you , 
  so are you saying that the estate is the property of the monarchy 's office as a function of government , or separate from government ? 
  i disagree with that point too , though it is debatable whether or not cromwell was a republican by default or genuine principle . 
  do you mind sharing some sources ? 
  my understanding of the constitution was that the crown symbolised government , back from the days when the monarch was the government . 
  i found a few this way - http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=this+week&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on, 
  tourism revenue is not only irrelevant to our constitution , the suggestion that the monarchy promotes tourism is completely without evidence . 
  legoland gets more tourists than windsor castle , and i daresay that buckingham palace would get more money if it were n't a * private * residence , with a * private * art collection .
