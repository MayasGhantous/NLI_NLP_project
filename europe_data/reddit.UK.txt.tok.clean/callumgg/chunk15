  the british tourism industry is successful without figureheads , castles and palaces would remain part of britain anyway , as in france . 
  attractions such as the london eye , trafalgar square , stonehenge , the beautiful countryside and lake district , will still be there in a republic . 
  ceremonies such as the changing of the guard do n't need to change either , and also people do n't visit saudi arabia because their head of state is n't elected . 
  if you 're talking about the crown estate , [ you could 've done better to have a look at the ` about us ' section on their website ] ( www.thecrownestate.co.uk/about-us/ ) which states that it is `` not the private property of hm the queen '' - i get that ` crown ' is similar to ` monarch ' and ` royal ' but it does n't legally have the same context . 
  the way to have politicians you can trust , who are n't ` shitty ' , is to have accountability and limits on their power . 
  this is something that the monarchy gets in the way of . 
  also , it does add rights to people , as it gives them the right to be represented by the head of their country , and even the right to be the head of their country . 
  the argument that it does nothing but bring in money is irrelevant , and also untrue . 
  no problem , sugarcoating navalny was n't what made me annoyed at a lot of western media but implying that he was the leader of the opposition hit a nerve . 
  whilst i agree with a lot of what he does and say , he only enjoys ~ 5 % popularity , which is tiny in comparison to other opposition leaders like zyuganov . 
  also , darussophile may not bend the facts , but there is definitely a bias there . 
  i think mark adomanis of * forbes * , and daniel treisman ( more an academic , but i 've seen articles in * opendemocracy * and * foreign affairs * before ) are good ` russia watchers ' , who do n't show as much bias as a lot of people from either side usually do . 
   getting rid of the monarchy will suddenly make everything better and turn sleazy , shitty politicians in to ones that are competent and good ? 
  i think you 're exaggerating what i was saying . 
  i think better control over government by the public , rather than narrower interests , is good . 
  if you do n't think that then it 's fine but we 'll just having a bit of an absurd argument for nothing . 
  it could go the way of france or anywhere ; likewise a monarchy could go the way of thailand . 
  i think institutions like our head of state and the european union could do with some accountability , elections and democracy may be the worst form of government , but they 're better than the alternative . 
  well if i were happy with the current arrangement then i would think there are far more important things to be dealt with too !, 
  for me , this is n't about spending money on holidays for charles , princes , or palaces . 
  this is about the health of british democracy , and having an absolutely ineffective constitution . 
  the problem is , the monarchy is completely tied up with the constitution , and prevents us in many ways from having more control over government . 
  get rid of the monarchy , and we have new rules , that could limit the power of politicians , and make britain have a stronger democracy . 
  all depends on who you know . 
  i grew up in surrey , the 1 in 4 or 5 figure seems right . 
  i went to university in belfast , or visited people in scotland , the figure was n't representative . 
  republicanism is n't just anti-monarchism , 
  yes he seems quite popular as well , there are people in / r/republicanism who identify as ` pettitian ' . 
  he wrote a book about his experiences in spain , which you reminded me i still need to read . 
  it shows just how committed you are , especially as a decent amount of republicans are from the left wing . 
  also , a fellow cal ( l ) um blogger !, 
  i felt like the article was doing a good job showing that republicanism was more than just anti-monarchism , and that there are lots of different views behind it . 
  i think things like the lack of accountability and representation , the discouragement of ` civic virtue ' etc. 
  are more important . 
  in a comparatively rich country like britain , the monarchy only comes to around ~ # 2 per person , every year . 
  the cgp grey video is purely about the cost of the monarchy , the guardian article is about the campaigners and public behind republicanism . 
  it also talks about how the monarchy can be compatible with republicanism , the only paragraph about expenses and tax is about the new sovereign grant , which makes the video / u/tepay shares obsolete . 
  it is no more relevant than me just posting a video about the foreign office 's expenses under an article about its work in east asia . 
  the article is about the mobilisation of republicans , and the different factions within it , in britain . 
   i ca n't honestly say i 've ever met an actual adult republican i do n't know where you live , but in london ( where i 've been most of my life ) , the 1 in 5 figure is about right among adults ( not sure about the edgy teenagers ! ) . 
  mind , the largest number of people would fall into the ` do n't care ' side ; which i feel they count as for whatever the status quo is in these polls - be it republican or whatever . 
  i realised that far too late : s, 
  the article is n't about that , and that is n't even one of the best cgp grey videos . 
  edit : has anyone actually read the article ? 
  plus , the video is obsolete when you take into account the new sovereign grant . 
  the uk does have laws but they 're not enforced . 
  thailand is a monarchy which has some pretty nasty ones though , with absolutely ridiculous sentences for not standing up to the king 's anthem in cinemas , for example . 
  anyway , that 's a tangent . 
  i get what you mean about the monarchy representing the ideals , and i definitely agree with your conclusion !, 
  on a side note , i do n't think a monarchy can represent large countries like spain and britain , which have a lot of different identities within them . 
  mentioning the queen in northern ireland is a good example of this . 
  i really think a constitution would do the job better for spain . 
  a compromise would be what the polish-lithuanian commonwealth did , where a king is present under a * forma mixta * , has to sign what basically surmounts to a social contract with the people , and is balanced by the power of other institutions . 
  a constitution by itself , though , would be preferable to me , 
  have you just given up ? 
  i wrote an essay for you , and this is all i said on the expense of the monarchy `` the cost of monarchies varies from country to country '' . 
  it was n't even a big deal for me , i 'm starting to think i 've been ` trolled ' on a side note , i have seen that video before , and it only counts select expenses of the monarchy . 
  not cgp grey 's best work . 
  you know , if you actually backed up anything you said , rather than just calling republicans ` liars ' and whatever i say ` tripe ' then maybe what you said about others trying to '' * weasel their way around the facts * '' might not be so hypocritical . 
   what a load of tripe , the monarchy ca n't be mentioned without republicans wading in these days . 
  if this truly is the case , then republicanism ( or maybe just anti-monarchism ) seems to be more popular around the group of people you talk with than you may have previously thought . 
   i do n't have any personal hatred for the ideology , i have a personal hatred for the fact that they straight up lie to try to widen that ideology 's appeal . 
  i 'm going to treat this seriously , as there is a problem of ` vagueness ' , especially in academic republicanism . 
  the waters are even more muddied by dictatorships such as north korea and the former east germany trying to claim the term along with democracy . 
  if you read the links i showed you though , it gives a pretty good overview of what republicanism * is * . 
   all of which are demonstrably , actually and irrefutably true . 
  the cost of monarchies varies from country to country , and countries like [ spain are a lot cheaper than countries like norway ] ( http://www.euronews.com/tag/european-monarchies/ ) . 
  interference is common , actually , and prince charles ' lobbying is an example of that . 
  whether or not it is compatible with a ` modern enlightened society ' is subjective , some people might think that modern means more ` freedom ' . 
  i live in britain , and the media really does n't . 
  in fact , since lebedev bought the * independent * , pretty much only the guardian online talks about it . 
  most countries in the world are based on republican government , and like the article says , it is n't wholly incompatible with monarchy . 
  in zapatero 's spain , for example , republican political theorists such as philip pettit were consulted on the state of the government . 
   there 's no argument for it , no desire for it , and the `` movement '' is a bunch of angry liars . 
  i do n't even know where you 're getting this from , or why you seem to have such a personal hatred for an ideology , that is loosely based around :  the importance of civic virtue and political participation , the dangers of corruption , the benefits of a mixed constitution and the rule of law , etc you can read up on it [ here ] ( http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/republicanism/ ) , or [ wikipedia if you trust it more than stanford 's edu portal . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republicanism ), 
  also [ did n't mean to say in the title that there * is n't * an organised european movement ] ( http://www.aerm.org/ ) , just that the british one is making some developments , for better or for worse . . 
  this article does n't just focus on republicanism as anti-monarchism or dissent to the british constitution , but also interviews such people as quentin skinner ( republican academic , see [ his recent ama here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/historyofideas/comments/11wkl8/quentin_skinner_answers_rhistoryofideass_questions/?sort=new ) ) and tony benn , talks about the compatibility of republican ideals with a less influential monarchy , and in general gives a good overview of the state of republicanism in britain ( and not just anti-monarchism ) . 
  x-post / r/republicanism, 
  found someone defending the judge 's ruling in english - http://darussophile.com/2013/07/18/jailing-navalny-is-stupid/, 
  it 's all politics !, 
  to be fair though , orthodox e. europe is pretty homophobic . 
  even lech walesa . 
  i think it 's partly because there 's been less integration and travel with the rest of europe . 
  ca n't rival free movement of the eu or erasmus with expensive visas . 
  we do n't have to be better than everyone else , just as long as we 're not last , 
  i think he did steal it , but i also think he would 've been able to get out of the sentence through bribes etc if people did n't see him as a threat to the current order . 
  i think we 've done well considering moscow was the head of the evil empire 20 or so years ago . 
  do n't forget you had [ section 28 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/section_28 ) in 1988 , hopefully it 's just a phase . 
  the judiciary is corrupt , and some enemies of navalny got their way there ( at least that 's what i believe , if navalny wanted to make money he would n't have gone into politics ) . 
  however , that does n't mean that the society or even the executive are in on it . 
  the biggest rival i see for putin is zyuganov , who would have won in '96 if not for election fraud . 
  next is prokhorov , who has support and the money to back that up , and i 'm sure he has some skeletons in the closet they could use on him . 
  i do n't think the same with zhirinovsky though , he 's on the margin , and is more of a diversion . 
  i do n't think putin or his ` clan ' are dumb enough to think that putting navalny in prison will do anything but martyr him ; i do n't think the same of lower-tier enemies of navalny , but that does n't mean that it 's wide-scale , top-down , etc. 
  oppression of the soviet kind . 
  i do n't agree with the verdict , but that is a terrible comparison that trivialises the millions who suffered and died in the gulags . 
  former critics of the gulags and ` liberal dissidents ' of the fsu who side with putin [ such as solzhenitsyn ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/148516 ) show the situation to be a lot more nuanced than that . 
  notice they did n't incarcerate him for [ inciting racial hatred ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2013/07/15/did-russian-opposition-leader-alexey-navalny-just-endorse-a-race-riot/ ) , but for :  organizing the theft of timber worth more than 16 million roubles ( $ 494,400 ) while advising the kirov governor in 2009 . 
  some notes on the russian judiciary , and how it is n't as independent as you 'd expect other european institutions to be :  senior russian officials , such as dmitry medvedev emphasised the need to improve the independence of the judiciary .
