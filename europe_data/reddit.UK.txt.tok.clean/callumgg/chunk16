   however , cases are not always as clear cut as people make them out to be . 
  for instance , in the 2008 boyev vs solovyov libel case ( boyev being an allegedly corrupt official and solovyov the one who made the accusations ) it would be ** expected that boyev ( a government minister ) would win against the broadcaster vladimir solovyov ** . 
  the first deputy chair of the supreme arbitration court , yelena valyavina , showed extraordinary support for solovyev 's claims and the case was dropped by boyev . 
   ** krugovaya poruka , which is a sense of mutual accountability and control felt in the judicial setting , influences judicial committees which oversee the independence of the judiciary . 
  ** progressive reforms made in 2001 at the start of the putin presidency fought against this contradiction , by appointing outsiders into judicial committees . 
  this was by all accounts successful , but not implemented widely enough . 
   former president medvedev has admitted that the legislation that is supposed to guarantee independence of the courts does not , saying that `` ** pressure , telephone calls and ... outright bribery '' are rife `` practices ** and attitudes that stand in the way of building a new , powerful , and affluent russia . '' whilst progress has been made , as the boyev vs solovyov case has shown as well as a weaker tolerance for ** interference from the oligarchy ** there are still many problems .

  even though i 've never smoked or tried to quit smoking myself , i assume it 's pretty difficult to quit . 
  all the french i know smoke , but not regularly . 
  relevant subreddits : * / r/monarchism * / r/republicanism, 
  it levelled out in russia recently , maybe ukraine 's next . 
  in the early 2000s there were already oligarchs . 
  in fact , the oligarchy is 1 ) why yeltsin won in '96 and 2 ) why putin was chosen over primakov ( they mistakenly thought he would be more complacent to their demands , for better or for worse ) . 
  the strength of the oligarchy has decreased proportionally as the state is no longer as weak as it was in the 1990s . 
  there was direct intervention in the economy by the state which benefited the state and the country 's elites , [ which was a concept of ` national champions ' which you can read up here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_champions ) and is n't all that bad imo , but if you 're against market intervention then you wo n't like it . 
  everyone benefited from that , but the state and the country 's elite did most . 
  in many ways putin and medvedev have let the market act more freely , such as the overall tax burden which was heavily reduced in the early years of economic growth . 
  tax in russia is one of the lowest in europe . 
  whilst i 'm sure you know about the growth of gdp and investment in russia from the early 2000s , you 're right , these alone are n't good for the majority of russians . 
  in this respect i 'm copying and pasting a section of wikipedia about the first eight years of putin :  real incomes more than doubled and the average monthly salary increased sevenfold from $ 80 to $ 640 . 
  [ 7 ] [ 10 ] from 2000 to 2006 the volume of consumer credit increased 45 times [ 133 ] [ 134 ] and the middle class grew from 8 million to 55 million . 
  the number of people living below the poverty line decreased from 30 % in 2000 to 14 % in 2008 . 
  i do n't think it 's fair that you 've been downvoted ( from 10 to 3 ) just now , i might not have agreed with * everything * you said , but on the whole your comment was well-reasoned and well-presented - if that 's not what / r/europe wants then fine . 
  if it 's about the russia not being a democracy claim , everyone has a different view of what democracy is . 
  yes the election fraud did n't make a difference to the final result so you have comparatively free and fair elections . 
  however , you could easily say russia is n't a democracy because there is ** no ** credible opposition - like if the democrats and republicans merged into one party in the u.s. , that is how dominant united russia is . 
  all the data is from the world bank , it says so on the first line . 
  although in the west and south of europe there are vast waters making a clear separation for europe , in the east it becomes peripheral - whilst st. petersburg is definitively a european city , vladivostok will rarely be given this status . 
  arbitrarily , some people define the eastern borders of europe with the ural and caucasus mountain ranges . 
  russia is a ` european ' country as the majority of russians , and the russian capital , are within europe . 
  the coloured countries here ( http://adrianchapman.com/maps/europe_1991_600x540.jpg ) are what is commonly referred to as ` european ' , ( although there is more controversy over turkey as some people use the [ bosphorus strait ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/52371000/jpg/_52371516_bosphorus_map_304.jpg ) as a means of defining europe . 
  also , some people are unsure over countries such as armenia , azerbaijan , and even iceland . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/russia/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp ) oil made up 15.42 % in 2011 , from a high point of 19.01 % in 2000 and a low point of 5.78 % in 1998 ( maybe something to do with the corruption in the industry at the time or subsidised oils to former soviet neighbours ? ) . 
  i could only find this `` the size of the whole alcohol industry in russia ( 0.48 % of gdp ) '' for vodka , which is strange because i thought it would be a lot bigger . 
  there is n't exactly a lot of tax on it though . 
  you can see the document here if you want - https://iweb.cerge-ei.cz/pdf/events/papers/120217_t.pdf - it 's titled ` peers and alcohol : evidence from russia ' ( 2011:19 ) . 
  i 'm not exactly a die-hard srser , but still . 
  i realise now you did n't know the connotation , but how else do you explain the phrase ? 
  the verb to suck is n't offensive in any other way that i know of . 
  schoolkids can use the word ` gay ' without thinking themselves homophobic but in the end it 's the same as calling someone a jew because they have a big nose or something . 
  it 's slang for fellatio , short for ` sucks dick ' . 
  also i was born and bred in london , so this is n't something a crazy volga english teacher taught me !, 
  good question , i do n't know unfortunately . 
  at the very least it 's because nobody wants to live there . 
  in soviet times people would go to places like siberia and murmansk for a few years to take advantage of the extra money and then come back after , this was a problem after the break up of the soviet union because they ended up being stranded there . 
  the whole syria issue is a lot more nuanced than you think , and essentially boils down to sectarian issues . 
  economic performance has been amazing for the last 10-15 years , lifting tens of millions out of poverty , and being attractive for investment for low tax rates ( although not for the bribery and corruption ) . 
  human rights records are abysmal compared to the rest of europe , but why should we compare the post-soviet ` sick man ' of europe with the shining city on a hill . 
  wait a bit , and you 'll see . 
  either way , you could have said it was a bad place to live or a poor and backwards country . 
  instead , you just said it sucked , which is extremely offensive given the sad state of gay rights in the country . 
  i have no problem with people debating the figures , or whatever . 
  in fact i like that , probably my favourite thing about reddit . 
  also siberian actually have some of the highest average wages in russia , but it 's not relevant to your point . 
  however , it was n't necessary to say ` russia sucks ', 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.gfmag.com/tools/global-database/economic-data/11944-wealth-distribution-income-inequality.html#axzz2zdkcxhjp ) russia is about the same as germany , ireland , u.s. , and only a bit more ( in comparison to the rest of europe ) than the baltics . 
  do n't forget corruption and legacies of communism though too . 
  very true , but it also has colossal problems of corruption and experienced painful economic transitions from communism and mafia-style oligarchy . 
  someone i know who knows a lot more knowledge of economics wrote something about potential economic scenarios here if you 're interested - http://therussiawatch.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/2030-another-new-russia/ edit : summary of post above -  ** the sanguine **  a highly positive scenario , with huge reforms by the russian government equivalent to the early 2000s as well as high prices for oil . 
  these two measures would mean the quality of life in russia would be equivalent to modern-day switzerland and arguably would be the largest european economy . 
   ** the phlegmatic **  by far , the most believable scenario , the phlegmatic couples sweeping reform with lower oil prices ( ~ $ 90/barrel ) . 
  this would put blame for economic woes in the hands of the government , as this model still predicts good growth for the economy . 
  much-needed action in business and social areas would jump-start an innovative and entrepreneurial society . 
  however , inaction will stagnate the private sector and may even trigger a brain-drain . 
  present-day france will be comparable to 2030 russia , with potential to go further . 
   ** the choleric **  high oil prices ( $ 140 [ \u2248 household daily income , 2011 ] / barrel ) lets russia maintain current growth , but a lack of political will to create reforms for whatever reason means that living standards will reach france by 2030 . 
  however , inaction will mean russia goes no further . 
   ** the melancholic **  present-day czech republic , which is modest in comparison the western europe currently , will be the outcome of the worst-case ` melancholic ' scenario . 
  low oil prices , as well as a lack of any reform would mean gdp remains stable but growth falling in comparison to the rest of the world . 
  yes it 's pretty dire , their politics and society have a long way to go too , even more so than russia imo . 
  especially as it would just make all of these problems worse , and most likely spill over into west scotland and liverpool . 
  so was i , but his friends were wearing similar shirts in other colours , maybe he was just lucky . 
  yeah if they had bonfires like this in the name of liberty or tolerance that 'd be sweet . 
  these people are n't representative . 
  some of the nicest people i 've met in the uk have been from belfast , and these kinds of people are n't exclusive to ni , sectarianism just gives them a soapbox and a whole load of excuses . 
  i think most of these were only this big because it was the city , and not representative of the whole of northern ireland . 
  it 's interesting to hear that the same things happen across the continent !, 
  yes i could n't believe how stacked up these were , with all the buildings so close and people throwing what looked like molotov cocktails into the bonfires . 
  what happens in cyprus for easter ? 
  this is what was happening today - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_twelfth drums and marching to celebrate loyalist culture and the [ battle of the boyne ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_boyne ) . 
  i really regret not brining my camera , only have my phone there . 
  the marches this morning were really loud too , stopped me having a nice lie in even with the windows closed . 
  context : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23277587, 
  the way the same community kicked up such a fuss about their flag being taken down off belfast city hall , and now they 're not so big on the ` respect flegs ' thing . 
  i was watching a bonfire last night off great victoria street in belfast , it was in a car park and the flame was so hot really quickly . 
  the huge crowd next to it had to run back because it would feel like your skin was burning to be close to it , some street lights looked like they were melting . 
  i have pictures from my phone , so i might post them . 
  just finished watching that - http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4nzduiv3u8o#t=454s i 'm in belfast right now just off the lisburn road . 
  the marches that are happening at the moment are really loud and the drums are intimidating , nevermind the fact that they 're just looping a daft little tune . 
  according to the map above . 
  true !, 
  we are but a small and highly cultured nation . 
  apparently we 're just a periphery to the rest of europe : / even ireland has nearly as much urbanisation . 
  it can be both i 'm sure , i just chose with what the bbc went with . 
  yes and i feel like it alienates people who might otherwise be interested too . 
  it 's a shame these people are often the loudest voices on both sides . 
  what people can forget is that republicanism is n't always about anti-monarchism , and that a lot of places in europe with monarchies are more ` republican ' and democratic than most other countries , particularly some that use the word ` republic ' in their name . 
  it would be great to have everyone elected and accountable to the public but i appreciate that in some places that you wo n't get * anyone * like that . 
  yes i 'm pretty sure the same will happen as did in the netherlands recently .
