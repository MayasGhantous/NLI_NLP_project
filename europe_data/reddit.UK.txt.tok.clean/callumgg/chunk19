  i did n't say either of us thought the uk should be more authoritarian . 
  i was making a deliberate stretch of your logic to show its flaws . 
  you said if the russian democracy is n't perfect , then the uk democracy does n't need to be perfect . 
  i was taking that to higher levels . 
  also , do n't bother replying anymore if you 're going to pretend not to understand whatever i say as i 'm pretty sure you must be doing this deliberately . 
  fair enough you assumed i was russian , for some reason i 've assumed you 're from the north ( w ? 
  ) of england ( i do n't know why , sorry ) but i have n't checked your comment history either - i 'm not expecting * anyone * to have time for that . 
  i did n't say the government were communist , i was asking if you thought that if the russian government were to become communist ( the communist party being the popular opposition to putin at the moment ) would that mean that the uk could have a more authoritarian state as it sounded like you were justifying a flaw in our democracy because of what you perceived as a bigger flaw in the russian state . 
  tl ; dr never said the uk was communist , i actually agreed with you that it was a democracy ( who would say it was n't ?! ) . 
  i was referring to the next * russian * election . 
  if russia became a communist dictatorship , would that justify britain becoming more authoritarian ? 
   well yeah , they provide a boost to our economy via tourism that 's true ... so it 's worth keeping a monarchy around , even if it does n't do much apart from providing a bit more tax money for us via tourism . 
  i was being a bit rude and sardonic when i asked about tourism , i admit my writing style did n't display that across the internet so i 'll just state that here . 
  i agree we do . 
  i was actually born in hammersmith , and have lived in britain all my life - my flair in / r/ukpolitics shows that as well as my comment history in / r/london i think . 
  aside from the fact that we should n't base our country on the lower standards of elsewhere , russia had literally millions of people in gulags not 2/3 decades ago and a rigged election in 1996 . 
  i do n't know what you mean by the funded rebels , but i expect you 're just trying to deflect . 
  why should n't britain deserve better because of your dm-esque views of russia ? 
  would it be ok for britain to have a bit of a dictatorship if the communists won the next election ? 
  they are powerless but they keep a check and balance on government ? 
  i do n't know if you 're being really subtle or just disingenuous . 
  ironically nearly every time they have used this check it has almost caused a revolution . 
  civil war , glorious revolution , arguably american independence ( followed by a sharp reduction in the monarch 's powers ) . 
  i sincerely doubt the monarchy would care if there were a fascist government , and if they did they 'd end up getting beat down anyway - so what next ? 
  tourism ? 
  public unity ? 
  tell that to norn iron . 
  oh no , i was wondering if someone would ask anyway !, 
  i do n't mind at all  [ here 's a pitchfork ] ( http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/9544/1862207-376149_pitchfork_large.jpg ) in case you forgot yours . 
  seeing as the whole book is opinion , i doubt he is that much of a liar to lie about his own views . 
  it was rhetorical , i 'd rather have an elected position than play hard & fast with both public money and mental trauma . 
  because my dad is russian , and on / r/europe i talk about russian politics * way * more than anything else . 
  i actually run a politics blog which talks a fair amount more about russia than the uk , so i guess that could be why . 
  well you can debate that with hari , because the most common claims of the psychological issues that monarchy has on the royals generally are hard to treat . 
  on another note , what * is * her job ? 
  i was actually born in london , and am still living in britain so i have at least a bit of patriotism , and i 'd feel quite embarrassed that these coins would be in circulation ( at least for some small part ) in countries like ireland or france - it would make us look medieval . 
  also , how could i forget turing ? 
  there 's definitely more , douglas adams ? 
  we could just have a different one every year . 
  my current favourites would be : thomas paine , charles darwin , isaac newton , tony benn , and adam smith . 
  maybe gordon brown just to piss everyone off . 
  there 's a really good book by johan hari on this , called ' [ god save the queen ? 
  ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1840464011/ ) ' about the damaging psychological affects the whole institution has on the windsors/saxe-gothburgs . 
  long live the republic !, 
  / r/republicanism, 
  why not britannia on all of them , get rid of the queen . 
  also , despite my flair i actually live in britain and was born here . 
  well more than any other leader before him i 'm sure . 
  take a look at what forbes wrote on the two countries , particularly the last paragraph if you 're short on time :  it is in this context , a russia that is marginally more integrated into the world economy and that is marginally better positioned diplomatically , that it makes sense to look at the country 's increasingly close relationship with norway . 
  throughout the cold war , russia and norway had relations that were , at times , downright nasty . 
  the soviet-norwegian border was the site of numerous disturbances , `` provocations '' as the russians like to say , there were continuous disputes over fisheries and oil and gas exploration , and even the little matter of a high-ranking norwegian politician being convicted of high treason for spying on behalf of the soviet union . 
  in short : the russians and norwegians did n't agree on much , did n't work together , and generally kept their distance . 
    however , over the past several years russia and norway have made substantial progress . 
  in 2010 they finally resolved their longstanding maritime boundary dispute with a treaty that was roundly hailed by diplomats as a example that should be followed in subsequent negotiations between countries bordering the arctic . 
  by all accounts , the russians performed ably in these negotiations and were able to reach a win-win deal that did n't leave any bitter feelings or recriminations in its wake . 
  russia and norway , countries with a long history of military confrontation and tension , have even started to conduct regular naval exercises . 
  [ ** source ** ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2012/05/05/russia-and-norways-increasing-cooperation-in-the-arctic/ ) that , together with putin 's * personal * preference of norwegian companies working with gazprom for example , and you have fairly decent evidence to the contrary . 
  he 's quoted as saying that you are `` a very comfortable partner for us for many reasons . 
  first of all , they do n't go around with their noses in the air ; they work objectively , very professionally . '', 
  there 's an article [ here that says it 's to do with the customs union and moscow 's political motivations at odds with yanukovich ] ( http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2012/12/20/russiaukraine-gas-talks-kiev-cornered/#axzz2ikkm4ulv ) so that basically mirrors what you 're saying about russia 's influence . 
  anyway , this is all quite interesting learning about something i did n't really know about onwards from about ~ 2005/2006 . 
  thanks for explaining everything so clearly to me !, 
  not clear from my flair , but i was actually born in london for reference . 
  britain i hold to a much higher standard , russia had literally millions of people in gulags not 20/30 years ago - does n't quite compare to thatcher and the miners . 
  yeah you 're good . . 
  it 's getting better , very very slowly . 
  so does anyone in ukraine still buy from gazprom , if rwe is cheaper ? 
  also , http://censor.net.ua/news/230200/gazprom_ne_budet_snijat_tsenu_na_gaz_dlya_ukrainy looks like it wo n't be changing . 
  as a side note , do you think this could be to do with yanukovych ? 
  i do n't know so much about ukrainian politics , but i heard ( just heard is all ) that tymoshenko was locked away on the pretence of giving gazprom too good a deal . 
  that 's quite interesting , as up until 2008 , european prices were 300 % higher . 
  could you give me a source i could keep for later ? 
  i do n't agree with you that russia wants to rebuild its empire ( what a waste ) but very interesting hearing about that fact . 
  oh but sopot has such a wonderful shoreline !, 
  they 're the new trade ambassadors for britain , [ as their mum ( the duchess ) got into a bit of debt bother ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/7932195/the-duchess-of-york-faces-bankruptcy-over-her-5m-debts.html ) . 
  good ol' fashioned british nepotism !, 
  what do you canadian people think of the prorogation though ? 
  ( hope i 'm spelling that right ), 
  even after the scandal about dissolution ? 
  it 's a very useful term if you 're talking about foreign relations , 
  the thing is , if oil prices continue to rise , gazprom wo n't see a need for reform and it will just be the elephant in the room ( or an essay that is n't due in for a few weeks ) . 
  [ this article ] ( http://therussiawatch.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/2030-another-new-russia/ ) outlines a few scenarios . 
   they have proved themselves willing to use energy and the winter to blackmail their customers , with the effect that nobody can truly trust them and everyone would prefer to shop elsewhere . 
  i assume you 're referring to the ukrainian gas disputes . 
  you might want to see the price charts here to see why that happened http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gazprom#sales gazprom should n't be a charity for the near abroad ( ukraine etc. 
  ) , especially when they 're forced to sell so cheap in russia itself . 
  well part of the problem is that gazprom is forced to sell gas so cheap in russia . 
  it is barely profitable within russia for gazprom .

  we all know nobody can tell the difference between good cheese and bad for the raclette !, 
  especially if you can get good vodka for under $ 10 . 
  playing devil 's advocate , should depardieu have right of return in 10 years time to france ? 
  it was a joke sorry , i do n't believe in any sort of death penalty - whether for kings , traitors , or murderers . 
  a few things glossed over by the article : * the crown estate has always been part of government , and just because the monarchy used to own and run the government it does n't mean that all the government 's assets prior to them giving the expenses of government to parliament should still be attributed to them . 
  * the expenses shown are not full , because the monarch 's total finances are exempt from the foa act . 
  * the official figures do n't show security , lost revenue and palace grounds maintenance among others . 
  the only group/institution that estimates including these is the republic pressure group ( # 202.4 m ) and if it were significantly smaller than this i 'm sure they 'd be more transparent . 
  * the british monarchy is 112 times as expensive as the irish president and more than twice as expensive as the french semi-presidential system . 
  * civil list expenditure has increased by 94 per cent in real terms over the last two decades .
