  north american gas , after liquification and delivery to hamburg , is about 7 % more expensive than gazprom pipeline delivered gas . 
  it varies across the continent , poland pays compared to the uk 's or france 's and then you have somewhere like armenia that pays . 
  are you talking about an average ? 
  ( edit : per thousand cubic m iirc ) i 'd like to save what stats you have for later please , 
  the logistics would n't be * too * hard . 
  russia would get a lot less money though . 
  with europe they can set the price to what they want , china less so . 
  i mean , it 's more complicated than that but you get the idea . 
  okay , i was n't understanding what you meant when you said `` we 're ready '' . 
  long-term , europe really needs to diversify supply though . 
  you might like / r/energypolitics by the way . 
  gazprom allegedly cut gas to poland for diverting some to ukraine . 
  if europe were to move onto lng , then there certainly would be a political will to build more pipelines from north africa , and maybe even send peacekeeping troops there ( ? 
  you 're right sorry , i 'm grouping all of these together !, 
  it would n't be enough to bypass ukraine though . 
  lng is prohibitively expensive , and yes i mentioned north africa as a good possibility  when i said it wo n't last , i meant that the gas supplies you linked would n't be enough . 
  ironically enough , ukraine has the largest storage space for gas in europe but a lack of excess gas to store in it . 
  could this be a case similar to several corrupt leaders , where he has to win the election or go to jail ? 
   looks like ~ ~ thugs ~ ~ * conscripts * that don \u00b4 t have ~ ~ nothing else to do ~ ~ * a choice * but to grab some guns and shoot some people ftfy, 
   i doubt they would do it to germany , hungary and some other members they ca n't avoid doing it to ukraine without also cutting off the other states - [ see this map of gas pipelines to europe ] ( http://sites.uci.edu/energyobserver/files/2014/03/europe-pipelines.png ) . 
  on the map you can see two dotted lines labelled nord stream and south stream , these may be finished in the near future and it 's no coincidence that they have the exact capacity that ukraine currently has . 
  they 're being built to bypass ukraine for transiting gas . 
  it would be great if more people could come to / r/energypolitics to discuss what could be done to reduce [ european dependence on russian gas ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2014/03/russian%20gas%20europe%20reliance.jpg ) ( among other things ) . 
  it wo n't last . 
  europe needs to develop alternative energy sources , and alternative gas supplies such as through north africa or the nord stream and south stream . 
  ukraine is not a reliable transit state . 
   i realise that the rolling green fields of northern europe are actually very important to me in the same way as sunshine for southern europeans . 
  i think there 's some sort of instinctual relaxation in humans , being 1 ) amongst greenery and 2 ) in an open field with no predators in sight . 
  oddly relevant http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/how-to-invade-independent-scotland-195, 
  okay , sorry i missed that . 
  it 's hard to read intent through plain text . 
   but the english might just requisition it until the scots have paid the expenses the english incur as a result of scottish secession . 
  this sounds like pure speculation . 
  great , i should n't complain about a rent-seeking and anti-democratic institution because it costs a fiver ( assuming children pay tax too ) . 
  and yes , because there is n't really any concrete evidence that they 're good value for money . 
  it 's just wishful thinking . 
  that is just the cost of the sovereign grant . 
    however , the sovereign support grant is just one part of the total cost of the monarchy . 
  the royal family 's security bill is picked up by the metropolitan police , for example , while the costs of royal visits are borne by local councils . 
    meanwhile , income from the duchy of lancaster and the duchy of cornwall -- despite belonging to the nation - goes directly to the queen and prince charles respectively , depriving the treasury of tens of millions of pounds every year . 
    when all this hidden expenditure is included , the real cost of the monarchy to british taxpayers is likely to be over # 299m annually . 
  xpost / r/energypolitics, 
  will do that thanks !, 
   it 's still violation of the contract are there any repercussions for this ? 
   not the first time , btw was it the same situation the last time ? 
  ( diverting gas to ukraine ), 
  funny old world . 
  http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2564084 http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29154335 apparently poland asked for an increase due to a cold snap and russia refused because of the gas being delivered to ukraine . 
  note that only kommersant is reporting that ( maybe some others but i 'm not searching atm ) , bbc just cites them . 
  my bad , the article i posted was a day old . 
  i will try and find more info about this , do you have any other articles ? 
  yes i took it off when people got annoyed that i could n't speak the language well enough :( ( i am british , passport , name and everything ), 
  [ actual update from reuters ] ( http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/09/10/ukraine-crisis-gas-poland-idinl5n0rb2ki20140910 ) - german and polish gas operators report lower supply from russia * poland says volumes being delivered down about a fifth * germany 's e.on reports slight reduction in volumes * gazprom saying shipping as much gas as it is able to * eu fears that ukraine row could spill over into gas war ( updates throughout ), 
  the equivalent for russia would be the fall of the soviet union . 
  he said `` whoever does not miss the soviet union has no heart , * whoever wants it back has no brain * '' - whether or not this was him saying what people want to hear or something genuine is up to you . 
  libya is an example . 
  sorry it was the downvotes and i misread the '' . '', 
  as a '' ... '' , 
  yes but some countries got past that and others did n't . 
  and some other countries did the bare minimum reform and hit oil !, 
  i genuinely do n't see a problem with this analysis . 
  it 's not apologising for russian actions in ukraine , but pointing out that there was a context to it that would n't have worked out in more stable ethnic russian enclaves . 
  spb can into capital !, 
  you remembered !!, 
  well they did hold this big tournament recently to decide . . 
  rent 's cheaper . 
  well it does n't help that the sanctions closed dobrolets , the cheapest airline to there . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i like how this makes the distinction between eu and non-eu countries without completely blocking them out ) it also reminds me of the kind of images i saw in books when i was younger , so there 's a certain nostalgia in sharing this .

  it would also be cool to incorporate the existing high speed rail from moscow to st. petersburg and the on to helsinki . 
  there 's also nizhny novgorod iirc . 
  also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_extradition_of_baltic_soldiers, 
  i retweeted a red cross tweet a bit earlier , they have met with the convoy , they wo n't likely have answers right away or at least until the convoy makes camp . 
  why now all of a sudden i agree . 
  the rebels have been in a humanitarian situation for a long time and * now * they 're worried ? 
  this is either them realising a mistake , poor planning , or a distraction from something happening elsewhere . 
  also keep an eye out on the ukrainian convoy . 
  why ? 
  they 've probably been supplying weapons for yonks now , so to suddenly go through all this and risk journalists and the red cross to inspect it would be bad policy . 
  they 've made contact and are getting details clarified , i assume the same will happen with the ukrainian convoy . 
  follow their twitter for updates - [ @icrc ] ( https://twitter.com/icrc ), 
  the red cross are rumoured to be inspecting , russia and ukraine are not on good terms . 
  i 've been following the w. journalists who 've been given access to the convoy , so far i 'm skeptical of the claim that this is an elite spetsnaz group or something like that . 
  i 'm not saying that russia is being humanitarian for its own sake though , it has a lot to gain image-wise by sending aid . 
  check out the journalists @rolandoliphant @bbcstever @shaunwalker7 @arothnyt @roslyakovap @courtneymoscow or follow my retweets @callumgg, 
  i meant cancellation fees on the french side to the tune of 2/300m . 
  ca n't you get around wto by saying something is political ? 
  otherwise the eu/us sanctions would be classed as illegal too . 
  there * is * a huge cancellation fee iirc . 
  i was raised catholic , i just do n't like people being bigoted or racist . 
  if you could n't possibly understand that you looked antisemitic when you said what you did , then there 's little hope for you mr. 2edgy4me, 
  why ? 
  go through the thread and search for [ deleted ], 
  i 'm believing that you do n't want to appear anti-semitic , so i 'm showing you how you can criticise israel without looking that way . 
  if you * do n't * care , then you 're more than just associated with antisemitism . 
  this thread is about antisemitism in europe , not anti-israelism . 
  when you say '' * our * state . . '' you 're associating all jews with israel . 
  you also do n't seem tactful to the fact that these non-israeli jews are blamed for this , sometimes violently . 
  so , tl ; dr version : 1 .
