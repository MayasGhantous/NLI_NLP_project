  this albeit the slight fall in the last two years . 
  worked for france . 
  my favourite one is ` the awesome ' in the bottom right . 
  they all look like names from middle england , from swampton and middle meadow in germany and italy to white city ( am i talking about shepherd 's bush or serbia ? 
  i thought we just decided that you ca n't prove through variables , should i link an op-article ? 
  nobody 's arguing that the democratic people 's republic of korea is a democracy though , and i doubt you could find many people calling the gdr a democracy save * maybe * the former leadership . 
  you 're right , democracy is n't something that can be defined through one variable and a lot of it can end up being subjective . 
  i do n't see your point though , i 'm talking about press freedom etc. 
  to help you understand my side of the argument - not because it 's the be-all and end-all !, 
  it 's a system of government by the whole people . 
  the press is * relatively * free , albeit self-censoring and for those who only watch tv is overwhelmingly dominated by state media . 
  you can still go on google or subscribe to liberal newspapers like novaya gazeta . 
  the law is suffering from soviet legacies like krugovaya poruka , but there is evidence that it 's changing ( boyev vs solovyov was a high profile case , as was serdyukov and there 's hope still with justice for politskavaya ) . 
  we still call countries like israel , turkey , and mexico democracies yet they 're all around the same number as russia in your link . 
  i 'm hoping this one - http://www.smh.com.au/world/bardot-threatens-to-quit-france-to-save-elephants-20130105-2ca93.html - will be the last of them !, 
  a lot of fuss about nothing , depardieu would 've been fine if he had n't made the whole thing so public . 
  on a personal note , the man 's a washed-up drunkard who feels that saving yet more of his money ( when he 's already got more than anyone needs ) will somehow make him happy . 
  it 's also a bit cringeworthy the way he praises russia , we 've gone far but we 've got a long way to go too and our democracy is certainly not as good as the french ( whilst i do n't agree with allegations of election rigging with putin , [ there is some worrying new legislation ] ( http://politicaldeficit.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/forget-2011-there-is-a-real-threat-to-democracy-in-russia-in-2013/ ) ) . 
  they say that the elections are ` deeply flawed ' and ` unfair ' but give little in terms of real citations save stuff like ` limited political competition ' ( which is ur 's fault ? ), 
  and the existence of state media . 
  freedom house is a joke , and there are far more respectable ngos out there that * legitimately * criticise russia . 
  for the idea of russia not being a democracy , i know it ca n't compete with countries like the uk/france/us but no election watchdog has been able to point anything but vacuous allegations since putin was in power ( there were some pretty solid claims to vote rigging in ' 96 ) . 
  the very idea that putin would need to rig elections whilst having an inarguable dominance in terms of popularity is a ** disingenuous ** fabrication . 
  it 's a harmless joke , i had to restrain myself from making a fuss over it though j'en ai marre !, 
  given their colonial history , i 'd say the belgian monarchs are up there as one of the worst . 
  crosspost from / r/republicanism, 
  very witty . 
  edit : [ see here for a post on the matter , and statistics showing that journalists in russia are much safer than the general population in terms of homicides etc. 
  ] ( http://darussophile.com/2012/05/23/russian-journalists-are-far-safer-than-mexican-journalists-ordinary-russians-and-their-own-counterparts-under-yeltsin/ ), 
  i was thinking very narrowly , and i did n't realise everyone else was n't . 
  there are good journalists , you just need to know where to look . 
  having more people in w. europe learn russian would bridge the gap between west/eastern europe though , and i 'm sure that would be a noble cause for the eu to follow . 
  no wonder i thought that then !, 
  honestly i think the peep show is better , but mitchell and webb look/sound/etc . 
  has some real gems . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's different writers for the peep show though . 
  that 's a depressing thought . 
  you already have a bit of it , why not just take fermanagh and then everything basically halvsies ? 
  i 'm sure nobody would notice anyway . 
  one could argue that some of those places are part of countries other than russia . 
  i 'm sort of for karelia being given back , but we won kaliningrad fair and square !, 
  haha exactly !, 
  you 're welcome !, 
   even simple things like the fact northern ireland is over 90 years old now and we still have n't settled on an official flag . 
  i do n't think n. ireland will till at least all the fleg people who protested at city hall and all that are gone . 
  there are just as many ` ulster ' separatists than northern ireland separatists . 
  i know ulster is n't northern ireland and vice versa but still !, 
  there are just as many ` ulster ' separatists than northern ireland separatists . 
  i 'm not saying i 'm an expert but just because my flair is russian does n't mean i do n't live in belfast . 
  there 's an / r/polandball if anyone 's interested btw . 
  this might help http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_separatist_movements_in_europe it also shows russia etc. 
  so many different ethnicities and such in russia i would n't be surprised if the original author just gave up . 
  also which ones win when more than one group has a claim e.g. 
  those in ulster who want their own state . 
  60 degrees celsius ? 
  wow !, 
  why never asia ? 
  just wait till charles gets in and wants to sit in on cabinet like elizabeth , only every week . 
  well the head of state certainly should n't be head of the church too . 
  iirc they were independent for a few years before anything happened , and they only started resorting to hostage tactics etc. 
  when they started losing . 
  what do you think ? 
  yeah you 'd just end up being swallowed up and becoming an oblast : /, 
  are you referring to chechnya ? 
  i do n't really think it 's a fair comparison tbh, 
  he came second after alexander nevsky in rossiya 's greatest ( dead ) russians poll . 
  i 'm so glad someone said this . 
  you might be interested in the words of advice given to him by his father [ that i posted to my blog a while back ] ( http://politicaldeficit.wordpress.com/2011/11/09/words-to-live-by/ ) :  say what you mean , mean what you say , do what you said you 'd do , and do n't attack people personally . 
  never knew that people thought this , thanks . 
  fair enough , we got your back . 
  does n't even show russia and [ for once we beat w. europe at something ] ( http://www.imo-official.org/year_country_r.aspx?year=2012 ) ) ) ) , if it were n't so aesthetically pleasing then i would n't like the map at all . 
  edit : better map that you can zoom into , and see * all * countries . 
  asia actually did best http://www.imo-official.org/year_country_r.aspx?year=2012, 
  what is it that they say ? 
  it is n't shown in the map , but russia beat all the other countries on the map by a not insignificant margin . 
  it is n't shown in the map , but russia got 177 - beating the highest shown on the map by 23 . 
  that would go against the / r/europe view of russia though . 
  the majority , if not all , of the pictures uploaded were reported as being underage ( 13-14 ) so do n't even try it . 
  this seems pretty standard in the uk too , love it . 
  mi6 does n't have the same negative connotation . 
  the soviet regime killed millions , with the help of the kgb . 
  i have immense respect for opposition journalists , but why is the biggest opposition newspaper novaya gazeta ? 
  it 's terrible , anti-putin does n't have to be inaccurate . 
  it might 've been the exile ( d ) that said politkovskaya was `` very admirable , brave , and very loopy woman '', 
  i think you 're confusing yeltsin and the oligarchs with the current government . 
  under putin & medvedev : the average monthly income went from $ 80 to $ 640 . 
  ( http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24443419/print/1/displaymode/1098/ ) from 2000-6 olume of consumer credit increased 45 times . 
  ( http://bank.samaratoday.ru/shownews.php?idnews=741 ) low tax burden . 
  ( http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=526745 ) the middle class grew by 47 million ( despite a decreasing population ) , and poverty was cut by over 50 % . 
  there is a big problem with wealth inequality , but at the end of the day i 'm fine with it as long as the most needy of society get a cut - which they do . 
  ( http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20080301/100381963.html ), 
  whose to say it has n't already made leaps and bounds in both democracy and wealth in the past 10 years in part by exploiting natural resources ? 
  i have a feeling i 've started this discussion with you before . . 
   ideologically bankrupt lukashenko is authoritarian left-wing just from having a glance of his wiki page , putin is described as everything from neo-communist to a neo-con capitalist - his policy is more pragmatic . 
  so yeah , putin 's ` ideologically bankrupt ' but i prefer the term `` not an ideologue '' . 
   fear to lose their authority more of a general statement , which would apply to practically anybody whose job does n't involve secure tenure . 
   whose support comes only from those whom they pay for it . 
  i 'd say lukashenko only has supporters out of fear and coercion , with putin i guess you * could * say that his support rests entirely upon the economy and how well it performs though . 
  good thing reddit karma is meaningless and hollow then . 
  i would n't usually try to talk about the kremlin in terms of power bases/clans but i do find it really interesting .
