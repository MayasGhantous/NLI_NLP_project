  i find it interesting how , from the start of the 2000s to right up until the past year or so there 's always been very tight clans ( see [ here for ~ 2000 ] ( ) and here for [ 2011 ] ( ) ) but just after [ the new cabinet there are so many newcomers that it will be very interesting to see what turns out . 
  ] ( http://rusrep.ru/article/2012/05/29/povorot/ ) i do n't think medvedev is centring himself around those who oppose putin , though . 
  i definitely think he 's more liberal but he would know that to gain support for any election that this would n't be the way to go . 
  what do you think of medvedev then ? 
  not sure why you 're being downvoted , lukashenko is a dictator . 
  they 'll probably keep to their economic zone for quite some time . 
  i think it 's wrong to compare putin to lukashenko , because putin is broadly a populist and lukashenko just does what he wants . 
  take for example khodorovsky , which is seen as one of the best examples by w. media of russia being a dictatorship was probably one of the most popular things putin did . 
  russians do n't see khodorovsky as a campaigner for freedom and democracy , but ( in mark adomanis ' words from forbes ) `` a two-bit swindler and thief who had gotten rich while the country collapsed and people died in the streets . '', 
  if you 've got specific points as to why they 're the same though , i 'm all ears . 
  russia is n't some third world country without any hint of an air or naval force , it has the largest nuclear arsenal and a huge military force . 
  i get what you mean , but still . 
  one of the reasons they gave him the award was cited as his role in stopping the chechnyan war and for managing to create a stable country from the 90s disaster that was russia . 
  russia is n't exactly a hegemon , but it 's still a big power ( if nothing else , regionally ) . 
  it 's obtrusive insofar that it uses its voice in security councils etc. 
  to put forward the collective views of moscow fp experts . 
  it 's not powerless , and not incredibly obtrusive - i see those as a bit conflicting when used together . 
  russia did n't support the guy , they just did n't support an intervention for either side - which were both criticised internationally for the use of not only violence but breaches of human rights . 
  when both sides of a civil war are bad , not everyone wants to get tied down in the conflict just to fight for the lesser evil ; that does n't mean they support the other . 
  to be honest you can disagree with putin 's domestic policies all you want but his foreign policy has generally lead to more stability and indirectly to peace . 
  i do n't agree with him getting a peace prize , but see this [ forbes article for a better view ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2011/11/16/putin-the-confucius-prize-and-western-double-standards/ ) . 
  edit : does someone want to tell me something to the contrary , or just come up with a weak argument to reinforce your world view ? 
  should there be eu wide minimum safety standards for nuclear power plants ? 
  [ study available here ] ( http://www.egmontinstitute.be/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/academia-egmont.papers.73_proef-2.pdf ) , x-post / r/energypolitics . 
  my university is one street away from there !, 
  i 'm impressed with the turnout . 
  yeah there was big support for the ssp leader when he sued for libel , at least until the allegations turned out to be actually true . . 
  quality varies . 
  also method varies , russian sushi is just ... different . 
  let me know if you find the reason out . 
  i was looking at data from decc that did n't add up last month , turns out they just filled it out wrong . . 
  the ec graph is from 2014 data iirc , they 're supposed to update market monitoring every quarter but they do n't include retail prices into the reports . 
  do you think this might be the case ? 
   i was talking about our consumer price . 
  we pay around 4p/kwh . 
  name some other countries in the eu that pay that little http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/4/40/natural_gas_prices_for_household_consumers%2c_second_half_2014_%28\u00b9%29_%28eur_per_kwh%29_yb15.png did n't mean to sound patronising , i work in this area too , and it 's a part of my job to make energy simpler to understand for the public at large so i was falling back to that . 
  this was published earlier this week if you 're interested - https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/monitoring-market/retail-market-indicators, 
  the wholesale price is the price the suppliers and traders pay for at the hubs , the consumer price is far higher than that when compared to the rest of europe . 
  the big six are making a good deal . 
  world gas spot prices have pretty much halved since this time last year . 
  how much has your gas bill gone down by ? 
  check ofgem 's switch website you might be surprised at how much you 're being overcharged . 
  there 's still plenty ofgem could do if corbyn gave them the powers . 
  the uk has some of the lowest wholesale energy prices in europe but this is n't passed onto the consumers . 
  railways though . . 
  funnily enough , there is a link between the droughts and poor crop yields in syria that were caused by climate change , which increased unemployment etc , to the social unrest that would become the civil war . 
  these countries have high rejection rates . 
  countries further away do n't . 
  if these countries were legally bound to accept war refugees then i 'm sure there would be less in the other eu states . 
  so did the swedes . 
  is this meant to be justification to dislike jews or just a fact you had to share ? 
  http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-3168678/business-leaders-blast-850m-uk-loan-greece.html the uk loaned over $ 1billion to greece . 
  also the idea that greece 's situation today is purely the fault of immigrants is ignoring a long history of overspending , public debt , and a global financial crisis that struck greece hard . 
  went to spb for a year , not that bad now actually . 
  of course it gets busy sometimes but you definitely get more than an a3 piece of paper to stand on . 
  better than london in the mornings at any rate, 
  maybe that man was dutch . 
  they eat a tonne of cheese . 
  i do n't think that 's why most people visit reddit . 
  can you back that up ? 
  most people stay on the big subs , and even someone like me invested in the little ones , i do n't go ` down the rabbit hole ' . 
  it 's stuff that 's on facebook and other media too , there 's just better organised discussion and voting here . 
  russian-american trade pales in comparison to russian-german or chinese trade . 
  it 's more about europe in the context you 're talking about . 
  overall it 's about the oil crash though , which i guess has its roots in north america ( delayed by libya though ) . 
  i lived there for a year , i still have like 30,000 r + tied up which has dropped a huge amount in value , and i work in energy in europe , so of course i 'm interested in russia . 
  and russia is european , so that 's why i posted it in this sub . 
  good daniel treisman excerpt here http://politicaldeficit.com/2013/09/16/writing-on-russia-postcolonialism-west/, 
  you should check out / r/hometours for decor inspiration , 
  glad to see this find its way to the right comment  i did edit my comment btw , but only to give an example and clarify what i meant by logistics . 
  i was under the impression that a lot of it was american ( e.g. 
  http://www.africom.mil/newsroom/article/10206/us-airlift-of-french-forces-to-mali ) . 
  interesting they used raf transport too . 
  i did n't take the photo or do editing afterwards . 
  i like the ` fake ' colours though , probably would n't have shared it if it were n't for them . 
  thanks !, 
  this was my source - http://www.boredpanda.com/aerial-photography-panorama-air-pano/ i then searched for a higher resolution and uploaded to imgur ( same username as here ) before submitting . 
  i did n't see this post before , but i am working in the week so may have missed it . 
  if you 're making an accusation like this the least you could do is share a link to the other post . 
  this is probably my fault for missing something , but why would the falklands be relevant here ? 
   zero unemployment there were unemployment allowances until 1924 , when these were abolished . 
  people who had worked for less than 6-7 years or had no working qualifications were not allowed to get registered for unemployment . 
  there were [ campaigns against ` parasitism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parasitism_\\ ( social_offense \\ ) #soviet _ union ) ' ( unemployment ) , but these often targeted the sick who were unable to work . 
  the poet [ joseph brodsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_brodsky ) was sentenced to hard labour for this too . 
  the soviets made unemployment illegal . 
  in fact , it was [ only in 1991 that they recognised it existed at all ] ( http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_law_60/ ) . 
  i ca n't speak about soviet healthcare ( my experience is second-hand from solzhenitsyn ) ) or education , or crime rates . 
  greece is an interesting one . 
  on the one hand there 's turkey right next to them , but they 're not really the most pro-eu ms. 
   put poland , slovakia , hungary , czech republic and romania together and you get something that looks like a military . 
  there would be more efficient logistics if they actually had a unified military though . 
  there 's a reason why france had to use american aeroplanes in its north african campaigns for instance . 
  sure in wartime they would commandeer civilian fleets but it 's worth having something there and for a small army it 's harder to justify economically . 
  i used to tag nearly everyone , and would pretty much only see tagged users in / r/europe back when it was smaller , and then i lost the file for my res tags by tinkering with it ` under the hood ' . 
  i really should 've saved it . 
  it 's not as historical as vaison-la-romaine , but i liked colmar https://callumgg.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/canals-in-colmar/ it 's like a tiny venice village, 
  '' * for the sins of your fathers you , though guiltless , must suffer * '' - horace ( odes ), 
  it has a special place for the monarchy . 
  not forgetting the non-stop positive coverage of the wedding , jubilee , birth , etc. 
  with minimal lip service to any attempts at scrutiny .
