  one example - http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/the_queens_diamond_jubilee/9104784/bbc-accused-of-peddling-propaganda-for-the-monarchy.html the argument comes down to whether or not you think supporting the monarchy is a political choice . 
  nope http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-crying-greek-pensioner-the-story-behind-the-poignant-photo-2015-7?ir=t, 
  should this be the case for the bbc and deutsche welle too ? 
  i mean the beeb may or may not be party political , but it definitely has other strong biases . 
  some of them are , it 's very clear which ones are n't though as long as you read past the headline . 
  it 's a french event that happened in france , it 's not that bad to have a translated french article . 
  let 's not turn a tragedy into a discussion about the multilingual status of / r/europe . 
  from my experience we draw the line at racism and sexism . 
  sure , most people will not be the good samaritan , but this kind of sign really goes against the modern british identity . 
  i saw ` sauna ' like three times , one ` susanna ' , and another ` seal of approval ' . 
  i 'm going to go ahead and guess that the translation is abridged . 
   so he 's pulling a farage ? 
  to be fair when carswell and evans saying that they would n't run , he would 've been burying ukip for good if he 'd have resigned . 
  it 's just ticking a different box for the passport , they wo n't have surgery or anything . 
  are you translating into american english as a parody of the anti d'clauzel crowd ? 
  well children are consented for any number of operations and dangerous ( or life-changing ) procedures through the consent of their parents already , so there 's that . . on the other hand , they are n't necessarily going to get hormone * replacement * therapy , but hormones that delay puberty , with regular blood checks to see if there are any complications . 
  yep , it 's annoyingly close to / r/europeans which is the in-depth version of / r/europe . 
  honestly / r/european is just as bad http://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/3b6bk4/live_man_decapitated_in_islamist_attack_in_france/csja7gv, 
  in charge everyone 's genes would be mapped out like what they do with dogs , the state should give benefits to people who mate with others of same general geological ancestry  ...  if a white goes with another race they should be automatically treated like the other race ( white , black = black ) . . 
  meaning they can be deported and will face fines/losing citizenship . 
  and would you believe it gets even worse lower down the thread ? 
  well , it does . 
  vote weights are all currently well above positive . 
  no holocaust joke - not one of those people . 
  i will wait until entsog releases their system development map , which should be july !, 
  thanks for the support ) ), 
   it 's time to spam the subreddit with `` train stations of xyz '' again i can do gas networks , does that work ? 
  they do n't get a sex change , just to change ` legal ' gender and to potentially get hormone blockers ( to delay the effects of puberty ) when they reach that age . 
  the requirements for sex change are usually quite strict and often involve a period of time to prove that they are serious , in this respect it means that they have a longer period of time to ` prove ' they are transgender and that this does n't have to occur at the same time as puberty ( when male-bodied people get broad shoulders , back hair , and so on ) . 
  from the british foreign & commonwealth office :  mr primakov led a number of economic reforms which helped to restore stability in russia . 
  as foreign minister , he was respected by the international community also [ fondly remembered ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/3b6huw/exrussian_pm_intel_chief_primakov_dies_at_85/ ) in / r/russia, 
  do n't stop posting bilingual comments , it 's helping me practice my french !, 
  europe is united in diversity :d, 
  i find it funny how you surreptitiously added in ' \u0441\u0443\u043a\u0430 ' to the russian one . 
  so if a big company decides to move there because of the lower costs it may attract smaller companies and services and the city can rebuild ? 
  extremely optimistic , and much slower process than people think , though . 
  robot and frank was a really heart warming movie on that subject . 
  imdb : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1990314/ might still be on netflix , which is where i watched it first . 
  so this is n't the sort of thing i usually post to / r/europe , but i thought it was interesting and why not ? 
  it shows how europeans actually * live * and the interview of this ` artistic director ' had a nice backdrop to it . 
  anyway , if this gets a good response i 'll keep posting more home tours and interviews of people from european cities to here . 
  if not , there 's actually a subreddit for that - / r/hometours , 
  some possible factors : * inadequate planning . 
  * access to funding . 
  * poor procurement of contractors and contractor management . 
  * aggressive estimates . 
  * optimisation bias . 
  * changing risk appetite . 
  hydroelectric dams and nuclear have the greatest proportion of cost overruns , even when normalised to overrun per installed mw .

  ah well i was trying to sum up this :  in october 2014 , the european commission adjusted the `` gain-share mechanism '' so that the project does not break state-aid rules it did sound like it was changing regulation/law . 
  but i can see why it would n't be now . 
  areva need to move into servicing and decommissioning nuclear power , at least for the meantime . 
  the market is way too tight right now . 
  something similar happened for the uk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hinkley_point_c_nuclear_power_station they even had to change * eu * law because there was too much state-aid http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/372216e6-4ec0-11e4-b205-00144feab7de.html olkiluoto is really a case of its own though , it was ** 9 years ** late .

  i guess if we have different definitions nothing will come of it \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af sorry for wasting your time . 
   centralised power , corruption , a caste of almost hereditary privileged people ... and a constant presence of a vague external threat to me this just sounds like authoritarianism in lower to middle income countries . 
  russia could be a dictatorship which is n't soviet imo . 
  what part did you grow up in , out of interest ? 
  i do n't think it 's worth us arguing anymore if we 're coming from different premises but it 's always been interesting to me hearing the human side of this . 
   the points you 've listed are mostly the things that made ussr lose the cold war , with the brain damaged communist economic policies claiming the first place well , what * is * the soviet union then , if not a pervasive , economically controlling , and war-geared state ? 
   so , although the methods may have changed , the soviet goals ( and most importantly , the soviet mindset ) have come back can you expand on this ? 
  my point was that just because it 's non-soviet does n't mean it 's good or like the west , so do n't call it something that it 's not . 
  the soviet goal was to spread communist ideology , if the goals and methods have changed , and the state of society is completely different how is it the same ? 
  again , ** i 'm not saying non-soviet = good ** , but there 's no need to jump to these terms when they make no sense . 
  point 2 is important , it marks a fundamental change in the idea behind the state . 
  one being a nationality with shared ethnicity , another being an ideology . 
  it 's a huge demographic change too . 
   communist ideology has mutated into a vaguely racist one so you admit that there is no communist ideology , but a sort of nationalism driving things ? 
  point 3 is the difference between turkey and north korea , where there 's a chance in one and complete control in the other . 
  if public opinion turned against putin he would need to either change the institutional framework of russia to stay in power , or resign - this is not the same in a one-party state . 
  your article is behind a paywall . 
  is russia over-militarised compared to other countries given its size , and fear of china in the east ? 
  it ca n't project power far beyond its borders , which was something that the ussr could do . 
  in fact , it ca n't even project power into certain fsu states anymore . 
  this is a graph of military spending in 2013 $ billions - http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/legacygeneric/usrussiadefspend.jpg - look at the drop . 
  the ussr was spending nearly as much in nominal terms as the rest of europe combined , and more than asia & oceania + middleeast in 1989 . 
  you can say russia is dangerous , aggressive , racist , etc. 
  what you ca n't do is call it a marxist-leninist garrison state that rivals the global hegemon . 
  and you ca n't redefine the soviet union as a nationalist country of about half its previous population with slightly above average military expenditure as % of gdp and an authoritarian ( but elected ) leader , because that was never the soviet union . 
  i think a good example would be if germany were to expand their military , i would not , even as someone who lost a lot of family to the nazi state 's camps , think that they were trying to rebuild nazi germany . 
   i 'm not sure why `` having a political axe to grind '' is bad i agree with you , it 's not . 
  not a fan of the cream paint at the top but i could definitely have a relaxing drink up there . 
  my favourite architecture is probably more pastiche . 
  my favourite cities for buildings are strasbourg ( really great mix of old style gabled , more formal french , and modern there ) , london , edinburgh , and st. petersburg . 
  one of my least favourite areas is the place around and including the kamppi centre in helsinki - it just felt so clinical and uninspired so i can see why a lot of people would n't like brutalism with buildings that have less ` flair ' to them . 
  yesterday in russia ** they celebrated independence from the soviet union ** , a holiday created by putin 's administration to replace a holiday celebrating the formation of the soviet union . 
  ** the russian federation is much more * russian * than the soviet union ** . 
  by the '80s , the soviet union was just under 50 % russian , the new russia is around  80 % russian . 
  wars are fought less over communist ideology , but russian ethnicity . 
  ** putin does not want a one-party state ** . 
  i mean , he wants whatever * his * party is to dominate but he does n't advocate eliminating all opposition as part of the way to his ideal society . 
  he * wants * zyuganov there opposing him , it 's part of his image and a source of his power . 
  for years any political activity outside of the communist party was illegal , and there 's just no parallel for modern russia - flawed democracy it may or may not be , it does n't outlaw all other political parties . 
  ** the rf is not a state made for war/garrison state ** . 
  the soviet union had ( in conservative estimates ) between 20-30 % of its gdp spent on military . 
  civilian manufacturing always had to have ` dual-use ' for military hardware , the entire economy was geared for war . 
  russia now does not have the same requirements , control , and spends around 5 % of gdp on military .
