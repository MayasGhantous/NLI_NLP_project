  ** russia has a convertible currency ** . 
  the soviet union held tight control over foreign trade and foreign currencies . 
  you could n't just turn all your rubles into dollars , which is pretty easy to do today . 
  the ruble had an artificial exchange rate which showed strength but in practice created a black market highlighting its true value . 
  the ruble today is free floating and market based , something which has been very apparent since the crash in oil price . 
  ** russia has a ( mostly ) free market economy ** . 
  putin 's russia does not , and will not , control all the factories , banks , teremoks , non-strategic assets , flower shops , and so on , that make up the economy . 
  the soviet union created distortions through massive subsidies and non-market control of industry . 
  here 's an example :  the soviet union 's policy to contain inflation was not to raise interest rates or limit bank lending but * to make inflation illegal * . 
  inflation was banned and prices on a host of important goods were frozen ( consumers , of course , paid the increased cost through ever-more-pervasive shortages ) . 
  the soviet treatment of unemployment was similar . 
  the soviet union sought to lower unemployment not through tax credits or through loose monetary policy but * by making unemployment a crime and forcing enterprises to boost their payrolls * 1 . 
  ** russia has open borders ** . 
  the ` iron curtain ' was n't just poetic , it was very real to the people living there . 
  check [ the video here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1xlpiq/in_1988_four_people_tried_to_escape_from_the_gdr/ ? 
  ) , these people were willing to die to escape - escape , not just emigrate . 
  i think this is the most important distinction , the soviet union could never offer the quality of life ( social or economic ) that a capitalist society could . 
  if there were n't giant walls , towers , and guards , a huge portion of the population would have just fled . 
  today thousands of russians leave the country very easily - simply get a visa ( from certain countries ) , get on a plane or bus , or train , and leave . 
  so i 've taken some inspiration from different sources to try and make this into a comment and discussion rather than a ` look at this link and change your mind ' sort of thing . 
  but i ca n't paraphrase this paragraph , it 's just too good :  the fact that russia differs from the soviet union does not , of course , mean that it is good . 
  just as soviet is not a synonym for bad , `` not soviet '' is not a synonym for good . 
  as should be clear , though , the russia federation and the soviet union have some fundamental differences . 
  from its position in the international order , to the strength of its armed forces , to its migration policies , to the nature of its political and economic systems russia is not the ussr . 
  anyone who suggests otherwise either does n't know much about the soviet union or has a political axe to grind . 
  if there 's a place to visit residential brutalist architecture i 'd say it 's the barbican in london . 
  i might hazard to say that this is more utilitarian architecture than brutalist . 
  see below for some examples of public brutalist architecture in the soviet union : bus stop http://a1.dspnimg.com/data/l/2500908604492_hubj13ku_l.jpg hotel http://i2.wp.com/weirdrussia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/frederic-chaubin-druzhba-holiday-center-hal-yalta-1984.jpg sports hall in lithuania http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--1_2bqauc--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/y2gprtxh4jbcnqtl6mmm.jpg i think this was georgian ministry of transport http://www.modernaustin.com/wp-content/uploads/dsc09379_gal700px-590x393.jpg, 
  the soviet union had no ` official language ' either , only a language of `` interethnic communication '' or something like that . 
  why ? 
  medvedev would take some manoeuvring but maybe i 'm underestimating him , and shoigu will be too old by that point imo . 
  i 'm not trying to say that rogozin or a younger zyuganov type * will * get in , just that they 're uneasy scenarios . 
  maybe rogozin or ( worse ? ), 
  a younger zyuganov clone . 
  worst case scenario is the self-parody zhirinovsky , but he has as much chance as navalny imo !, 
  it just means one haha , pronounced a bit like `` ahdeen '' . 
  it was a day to replace the october revolution day iirc . 
   also they kidnaped estonian police officers http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29078400, 
   how is it viewed in russia ? 
  '' * whoever does not miss the soviet union has no heart . 
  whoever wants it back has no brain * '' - putin, 
  who replaces putin though ? 
  he 's popular because of his role in russia 's resurgence , it will be harder to be an authoritative leader once he 's gone without a more concrete view of what ` putinism ' is . 
  it 's contentious because it replaced the communist day . 
  it 's cool because the opera ( boris godunov ) that portrays it is really good ( if a bit richard iii-esque in its portrayal ) . 
  st. petersburg is n't that far away from the netherlands , 
  not so different from the uk then , except [ we do n't have gaelic and cornish on our banknotes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/1_rouble_1947_front.jpg ) . 
  i agree , and that cgp grey video has bad history written all over it . 
  the faq page on the crown estate 's website openly contradicts him . 
  it 's almost as if he just went to a pub in windsor and took notes from a punter there . 
  then there would be no need for anti-spanking laws , 
  reading about the swedish ban was really interesting , http://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/09/world/sweden-punishment-ban/ i liked this quote :  if parents are hitting , it means they 've lost control , and might need to learn about other options . 
  they do n't charge the parents for spanking they help them understand the consequences and give them other options :  `` the police are not going to say , ` this parent should be charged , ' '' said durrant , who has studied the effects of sweden 's ban for decades . 
  `` the police will say , ` what you did is not ok , i understand why it happened , but you need to know that 's against the law , and here are the supports available to you . ' '', 
  it 's not respecting authority if your child is cowering in the corner every time they do something wrong - that 's fear , it 's abuse . 
  all they learn is that violence * is * the answer , they as children just do n't have enough strength to wield it because they went up against an adult . 
  there is [ research to support ] ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/nurturing-resilience/201009/spanking-makes-kids-more-aggressive-the-research-is-clear ) that [ this mindset continues ] ( http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1983895,00.html ) over the long-term . 
  other methods have lasting results in which the child actually learns * why * something should n't be done and that is what parenting is about , true character formation , not using violence to get compliance . 
  pretty much all of the psychological research tells us ** not ** to hit children ever . 
  it 's just not worth it long-term , and my personal view is that it 's a humiliating and savage thing to put the most vulnerable in our society through .

  i worked in a referral unit for kids like yourself , from around 4 years old to 18 . 
  when they arrived they would be violent , attention seeking , and would throw tantrums and destroy furniture when they did n't have their way . 
  it took a lot of patience , something that would 've been even harder as a parent , to keep saying no when a kid was on a rampage . 
  the only touching we were allowed to do was to lead them out of the classroom when they were being unacceptable . 
  the key was to treat them with positive and negative reinforcement , talk to them with an expectation that they are to behave , and show disappointment or a refusal to acknowledge when they are being inappropriate or attention seeking . 
  children learnt through example , when parents swore , the kids brought it to school . 
  same when parents lost their temper . 
  and violence . 
  it 's a cycle because the beaten kids will do the same to their own children when they grow impatient . 
  there was a british tv show on recently about obstinate and violent children . 
  the lesson there was to be patient and refuse to give the kids a satisfying reaction . 
  i ca n't find a video that would work in hungary but i 'm going to go on my computer and try to find a write-up for it . 
  but who decides which kids have such issues or not ? 
  some parents have deep biases against their children , or might simply use such issues as an excuse . 
  it would just be easier to use nonviolent measures and sanctions . 
   they are able to listen to reason not all . 
  and why ca n't children and teenagers respond to non violent measures like detention or taking away playstation privileges ? 
  the uk 's royal family gets to choose by law what percentage of tax they pay , and whether or not they pay tax at all . 
  so not much chance for tax evasion there , when you pay a voluntary tax of your choosing . 
   we should not expect them to be unselfish saints . 
  so if their children annoy the fuck out of them , they should be allowed to protect their sanity and peace if my boss or an employee of mine got on my nerves , should i be allowed to spank or slap them ? 
  what about an older sister ? 
  so because you had some deep psychological issues as a child ( not sure if they 're resolved now , hope you 're okay ) , all children everywhere should be spanked ? 
  my physical education teacher ( big guy ) told a story about how he hit the teacher back when the teacher tried to hit him for late homework or something .

  enough of a possibility that a russian tv show made a parody video out of it - https://youtu.be/cypsqsh8i4m, 
  russia has conscription too , you could end up shooting someone who 's against the war as well . 
  see this video for example https://youtu.be/lqogbg9ofok?t=113, 
  i think a lot of people in this sub might already think that the kremlin 's `` environmentalism '' and aversion to `` fracking '' may just be a tactic to slow down the western shale oil boom , an interesting article nonetheless . 
  x-post / r/energypolitics, 
  i think from about 2001 - 2004 it could 've been done if sold in a way that showed russia as an equal partner . 
  by the time rogozin became ambassador to nato there was absolutely no way . 
  china 's place in this is interesting though , as in the minds of many russians they threaten eastern territorial integrity , and an alliance with nato against china could be accepted by the hard-liners within russia . 
  in ir terms , this would seriously upset the balance of power though and would potentially accompany a downgrade of russia 's great power status ( with an upgrade for china to superpower ) . 
  it 's common among some groups of academics and within nus , but in the real world most feminists have a different view . 
  syria pre-civil war come to mind too .
