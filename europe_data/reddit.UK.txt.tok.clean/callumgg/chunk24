  the alawites were definitely not the majority . 
  and germanic , lowlands/french , northern italy i think . 
  i 'm actually a strong feminist myself ( no devils advocate here check my submission history ) , and i think the whole #killallwhitemen ` ironic racism but not really because we 're using an academic definition of racism built around oppression ' is absolutely backwards . 
  i just hope they go the way of terf feminists and find themselves isolated . 
  adopting the euro would 've been a bad idea for russia , but under putin russia developed immeasurably - who knows what could have happened had russia had the same support as poland ( both in terms of eu hand-outs , common market investments , and economic liberalisation ) ? 
  it would be like the uk giving away gibraltar though , it 's one thing pooling sovereignty in the european ideal , and another giving part of your sovereignty away to a separate country !, 
  but i agree with the sentiment i think i sense here , that it 's a shame russia and europe did n't integrate more before the current crises ( something that the eu could have prevented ) . 
  i think there was a serious case of political soul searching in russia around the turn of a century that we missed taking advantage of through our own well-developed institutions . 
   there have been rumors that putin offered the k\u00f6nigsberg oblast to merkel in exchange for a financial sum some years ago . 
  if ever there were a move that could 've triggered a revolution under putin , this would 've been it . 
  the people there may be anti-putin , but that does n't mean they do n't identify as russian for instance . 
  it 's not * that * small a population too .

  it was n't obvious to our group sorry : / ( 3 brits , 1 dutch , 1 swiss ) . 
  are you saying that dimitri was making a joke specifically about the state of russia 's democracy ? 
  yeah there was just tension because it was russia . 
  sweden did the same joke before and people found it funny https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfusnvrug0, 
  do they not say ` las malvinas ' , or is that deliberate haha ? 
  and we do n't have to host it !, 
  i would n't say russia is a superpower . 
  it 's more about repetition than dominating one day 's front page , same gripe some people have with reposts , a lot of these anti-russia posts are just repeating the same idea/feeling and reddit is supposed to be ` fresh ' / hot with news and interesting links . 
  i was on a bus from russia to finland the other day and the bus company had blocked imgur on their wifi . 
  desperate times . . 
  grey means there 's no data available , the epo only serves a limited number of countries .

  the real fear are his children , who have covered their political views very well but have not taken a public stance on being ` activist ' monarchs . 
  this is important as it shows the active political lobbying and influence by the heir to the british throne . 
  the law has been changed since , so this is why you wo n't see any more recent correspondence . 
  which is why the political turn away from wind is so at odds with our energy targets . 
  [ the top five largest power stations in the world are all hydro ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_largest_power_stations_in_the_world ) , and out of the top ten currently in operation there is only one other energy source , [ bruce nuclear power plant in ontario canada ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bruce_nuclear_generating_station ) . 
  of course , this creates issues with transporting the energy , often with some considerable loss along the way . 
  i 'm pretty sure eu law supersedes uk law http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r_v_secretary_of_state_for_transport,_ex_p_factortame_ltd, 
  the report i linked argues that support for nuclear creates issues that inhibit the development of renewables , promote a more energy-intensive society , and lead to an increase in fossil fuel increase or electricity imports during winter peak load . 
  my understanding is that you believe them compatible and complementary components of an energy mix ? 
  yes it really is amazing , i ca n't imagine how different things would be for me if it were n't for the internet . 
  i used google street view to choose my undergrad university for instance , and only heard about my postgrad university through the internet . 
  anyway , thanks for taking the time to find and share it , 
  thanks !, 
  could change it to something briefer like this and it would still fit on two lines .

  whereabouts is it ? 
  i 'd like to visit it . 
  i do n't know if it were the soviet 's intention , but as someone who had a lot of jewish family on the eastern front , it was probably for the best . 
  the armenians have their own jokes too :  an old armenian is on his deathbed : `` my children , treasure the jews . '', 
  `` why jews ? '', 
  `` because once they are dealt with , we will be next . '', 
  the wholesale prices have gone down year-on-year since 2010 , yet i 'm pretty sure the retail price ( for residential , not industry ) has n't . 
  i know it 's not germany , but the uk is giving feed-in tariffs ( not indirect subsidies , not taxes , but the same treatment as res ) to new nuclear at [ ** 300 % higher than new solar and wind ** ] ( http://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/feed-tariffs-british-nuclear-power-rile-german-politicians-and-renewables-industry ) . 
  i agree that we should be aware of the sunk costs that have already been put into nuclear , and evidently there were some political decisions made in closing down germany 's nuclear power plants . 
  however , nuclear energy in the free market economy without government support is simply not competitive even as a power source that has been in widespread use for over 50 years . 
  it would be interesting to see hard statistics on how much this loss is , if there is one , and make a comparative cost of pumped storage as an alternative , and so on . 
   but greens are against any form of nuclear reactors , no matter how safe they are the systemic effects of a nuclear power-based infrastructure include barriers to the development of an energy efficient + renewables based society - read chapter starting at p21 here http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/assets/boell.de/images/download_de/ecology/txt_20110407_froggatt_schneider.pdf, 
  they would n't be for it , but european greens do n't have too much of an impact on shale gas yet , which is mainly from the states . 
  you 're right to be skeptical about lng though , as it ca n't replace piped gas but it can give european importers greater flexibility and also leverage to get better prices from gazprom etc. 
  i 'd honestly rather they were building up more renewables sources of energy , but the cost is just too high to make it feasible for all production . 
  this is n't what the circle jerk on reddit is often about though , it 's saying that nuclear power is superior in all four of those aspects when it has unique properties , strengths , and weaknesses . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-03/german-power-costs-seen-dropping-for-fourth-year-energy http://www.renewablesinternational.net/german-wholesale-prices-continue-to-plummet/150/537/85395/ bear in mind that this is wholesale , so savings not necessarily passed on to ordinary germans . 
  around half of natural gas prices are oil-indexed , and i suspect this is even higher for gbp-bafa , so the price has been depressed a lot recently . 
  [ this is an important image of the logic of switching coal power to gas power generation in the uk ] ( http://www.timera-energy.com/content/uploads/2015/05/coal-gas-switching.jpg ) , the axes show the cost of coal and gas in their respective units . 
  the upward sloping lines show when it is more profitable to switch to gas at different turbine efficiencies ( bear in mind that all plants since 2005 are at least 52 % ) . 
  the little coloured dots show historical and predicted prices , and if the prices are below the upward sloping lines that means it 's more profitable to switch to gas at that point . 
  key here , is that there is a trend toward gas power displacing coal power , at least in the uk . 
  in terms of world energy markets , coal has been in a slump over the last five years and a lot of extraction is going to be shutting down , which means the price is going to rebound slightly . 
  in contrast , there is literally a mountain of new lng coming online in australia , not to mention the flexibility of shale gas in the bakken and elsewhere to keep prices around where they are right now . 
  this has only just started so we wo n't see a tightening of supply anytime soon . 
  it does n't look positive for gas exporters , gazprom reported reduced profits of something like 60 % at the end of last year and the market as a whole is vulnerable to big events like if iran sanctions lift or if japan starts putting more nuclear back up . 
  also , nuclear was nowhere near competitive with gas or coal , but their electricity system still worked . 
   build nuclear power plants , and basically undo everything thatcher and new labour did to the uk thatcher was extremely pro-nuclear , and new lab were pro too , despite it contradicting their other energy policies . 
  also not sure what you mean concerning ` multicultural rhetoric ' . 
  original title was this - ` even the seals are in patriotic mood as russia marks sacred victory day ' - but i felt it would be less clickbaity if people knew what exactly the seals were doing . 
   but in reality the russian leaders have always seen the use of alcohol as a safety valve for low morale i do n't think you realise the problem of people drinking f 'd up stuff like lighter fluid or industrial cleaner at times of economic crisis . 
  so it does n't `` literally say '' work better , as you said ? 
  it 's definitely more in some country 's interests than others - https://twitter.com/callumgg/status/590424042944987137 ( disregard lithuania and other baltics which have more bargaining power now ) . 
   estonia 's anti-ussr movement in late 1980s had a start from environment-related issues before quickly transforming into independence-question there was something similar in armenia following chernobyl and their own npp which was on an earthquake prone zone , but the authorities bowed to public pressure fairly early on iirc . 
  i 'm no expert in russian but i 'm pretty sure it says the word ` beautiful ' at the bottom . 
  have they heard about the uk ? 
  what about russia ? 
  what are some general opinions on these countries ? 
  also , thanks for doing this , 
  i like the pipes , and evidently others do as the buskers get paid by the public ( especially outside of tourist areas in still busy areas such as kingston ) . 
  well if he 's dishonest with them it sets a precedent for other pows not to leave for their dying relatives . 
  also http://www.agos.com.tr/en/article/11381/rakel-dink-a-century-of-genocide, 
  just wanted to say that another turkish newspaper published an armenian headline today too http://www.agos.com.tr/en/article/11382/cumhuriyet-and-ozgur-gundem-published-with-armenian-headlines-on-april-24  \u00d6zg\u00fcr g\u00fcndem featured the words \u054f\u0565\u057d , \u056b\u0574\u0561\u0581\u056b\u0580 , \u0561\u057c\u0565\u0580\u0565\u057d\u0578\u0582\u056b\u0580 ( see , hear , confront ), 
  that 's a good point , i was acting superficial . 
   what he did not do was reduce corruption , open the economy , and try to develop the country past being another corrupt gas and oil supplier he did for the first half of his first term , and recently has been opening up the strategic energy sector ( vedomosti reporting on the opening up of the arctic for private companies , selling fields to the chinese , growing discussion about a competitive export hub at nord stream ) . 
  it feels like he only makes reforms in crisis mode . 
  russia releases a statement like this pretty much every year , the gas stream will live on it 's a good deal for turkey with their ever growing consumption . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing_of_circassians#genocide_question in case anyone else was interested, 
  i have met plenty of people ( not government officials ) from turkey who recognise the genocide , but ( and this might be something to do with nagorno-karabakh ) i 've never met an azeri who would . 
  what are people 's opinions on russia owning most of the gas sector ( even with ridiculously low prices ) ? 
  do they want more iranian gas imported ?
