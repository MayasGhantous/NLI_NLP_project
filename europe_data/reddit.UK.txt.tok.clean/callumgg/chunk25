  i think if russia wanted eastern ukraine they would have had it by now . 
  they want a frozen conflict , ceding it to them would really mess up their gameplan . 
  i really hate this new branding . 
  ria novosti had history , sputnik 's website does n't look authoritative at all . 
  i do n't have a strong opinion on whether or not holodomor was genocide , but it 's important to remember that genocide is not just extermination but can be subjugation . 
  from the person who coined the word genocide in the first place ( raphael lemkin ) :  `` generally speaking , genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation , except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation . 
  it is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups , with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves . 
  the objectives of such a plan would be disintegration of the political and social institutions , of culture , language , national feelings , religion , and the economic existence of national groups , and the destruction of the personal security , liberty , health , dignity , and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups . 
  genocide is directed against the national group as an entity , and the actions involved are directed against individuals , not in their individual capacity , but as members of the national group . '', 
  more :  `` genocide has two phases : one , destruction of the national pattern of the oppressed group ; the other , the imposition of the national pattern of the oppressor . 
  this imposition , in turn , may be made upon the oppressed population which is allowed to remain or upon the territory alone , after removal of the population and the colonization by the oppressor 's own nationals . '', 
  speak : english , casual french . 
  plan to learn : russian , industry/professional french . 
  would like to learn : german , spanish . 
  the whole country was theirs , including * all * state assets . 
  in english jurisprudence , the ` crown ' is the state manifest - that 's why we have an office of monarchy . 
  `` evolved first in the united kingdom as a separation of the literal crown and property of the nation state from the person and personal property of the monarch '', 
  not according to their [ annual report ] ( http://www.duchyoflancaster.co.uk/upload/accounts%202010.pdf ) : * `` the sovereign is entitled neither to the duchy 's capital nor to capital profits '' * and the duchy is described as an '' * independent source of income * '' for the monarch [ by the monarchy 's official website ] ( http://www.royal.gov.uk/theroyalhousehold/royalfinances/sourcesoffunding/privypurseandduchyoflancaster.aspx ) . 
  i do n't think i 'm being voted on for the strength of my arguments but rather the idea of challenging anything to do with the monarchy - even facts that the institution itself calls ` myths ' .

  it 's an fsu thing , and i 've met a fair amount of people in w. europe who use it on im . 
  why did you specify a ` russian ' bully in particular ? 
  hope the mods do n't mind me adding the ` uk ' part in . 
  i felt that it might not be readily apparent for the other nationalities here . 
  starting basis would basically be a platform for discussion of transmission infrastructure in the black sea/balkans/caucasus / caspian area . 
  they are dependent on russia , but there are n't really any other options for them with turkey and azerbaijan blockading them , and iran not having enough investment to export much gas . 
  also , until nagorno-karabakh is solved armenia will need the protection of either russia or america - turkey is a lot stronger than people think and it 's hard for other states to project influence there . 
  i believe they still get some eu funding , armenia gets help with energy projects for instance . 
  you could do both , and get a good discount on your gas like armenia . 
  do you catch your own ? 
  is it premeditated or opportunistic ? 
  maybe baba yaga . 
  let 's not pretend that there are n't liberals in russia , just because those who have power want to silence them . 
  i like it , makes / r/europe feel more like / r / ( e [ iuvw ] r [ o\u00f3 ] + p + [ ae ] | an eoraip | \u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03b7 | \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430 ) :d plus , dclauzel helps me practice my shoddy french . 
   they cost # 32m a year not even by official accounts , [ which ignore security costs etc ] ( https://republic.org.uk/what-we-want/royal-finances ) . 
  they own the duchies , which they pay an undisclosed and voluntary amount of tax for . 
   they own a few billion pounds of land that they forfeit the profits of you may be confusing the crown estate because of its name ( crown does not equal monarch ) . 
  that 's okay though , the [ faq of their website clears this up ] ( http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/news-and-media/myth-busting/ ) . 
  the crown estate was set up for government administrative expenses hundreds of years ago , and was no more owned by the monarch than the navy . 
   the timing was quite convenient the rest of the quote makes it seem more of a dig against the current ` imposed ' western economic order . 
   i 'd say the british if you 're talking about select parts of england , sure . 
  in scotland and northern ireland for example , the monarchy is playing a divisive role . 
  they 're not great for marketing , they portray us as some sort of medieval theme park to the french and americans i know . 
  and them paying for themselves is very much debatable . 
   english :2056, 
  the pope [ may have been referring to this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/short_twentieth_century ) , an odd concept but still in use today , or maybe the ` first ' because the word ` genocide ' was [ coined to describe the armenian genocide specifically ] ( http://www.jewishworldwatch.org/conflictareas/world-crises/genocide-background ) ( and is the first ` genocide ' described as such ) . 
  also , to make sure that nobody conflates the german stance on past genocide with the turkish stance , [ they did actually recognise and apologise ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/aug/16/germany.andrewmeldrum ) . 
  i think the dutch are on a different level because of their king 's day ( upcoming ) . 
  even the most ardent anti-monarchists will get ` orange fever ' that day , whereas in the uk ( and i presume other countries ) national days for the monarchy are more polarising depending on where in the union you live . 
  wow , i found some ugly pictures of the uk too ( [ vice did a series on this actually ] ( http://www.vice.com/en_uk/tag/your+town+is+a+paradise ) ) !, 
  https://biowrite.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/morag_livingstone_housing_scheme.jpg http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/03/article-2303489-191036a8000005dc-629_964x637.jpg definitely means that india and ethiopia take better care of their neighbourhoods . 
  the reality is that : 1 . even in big cities like st. petersburg russians do n't care so much about the facade of buildings ( this is something that [ used to be an issue in edinburgh too ] ( http://www4.rgu.ac.uk/graphics/patchworkstonecleaning.jpg ) and is [ changing in richer areas of russia ] ( https://instagram.com/p/unoj_syic_/?taken-by=callumggreen ) ) 2 . 
  russia has gone through significant change and poverty over the past 20 years , so you will find that the population moves about , or that care of old buildings are n't prioritised . 
  i would accept turkey into the eu ( not like it 's up to me ) if : * they recognise the armenian genocide and stop the ongoing blockade against the country . 
  * they finish the reforms they started . 
  * erdogan is voted out . 
  * i do n't know enough about cyprus to make a comment about that . 
  i would accept russia if : * the power vertical is not exclusively siloviki . 
  * there are some caps to immigration ( both high and low-skilled ) for a number of years to begin with . 
  this is important for both russia and the rest of the eu . 
  * energy industry unbundled , conforms to third energy package . 
  * adoption of echr ( we can worry about full implementation later ) * someone figures out the role of the eurasian union in conjunction with the european union . 
  i can see why europeans could see russians as ` european brothers ' more than turks , but neither are realistic prospects for at least the next 15 years . 
  i do n't think putin wants east ukraine , ` giving ' it to russia would definitely force his hand though . 
   fully aware this 'll never happen we do have growing devolution across the uk though . 
  as a born & bred londoner i do n't identify with someone from darlington any more than someone from glasgow and i 'm not the only one . 
  it definitely is a good idea , especially if russia can get some basic standards for its consumer products . 
   use soft power and make lucrative oil deals while leaving all the administrative mess to locals which is sort of what 's happening with china in siberia now , and russia 's allowing it because of how low fdi is there now especially because of sanctions . 
  the timing is n't ideal . 
  a lack of trading liquidity , which is the ability to sell gas at its actual market price , in good time . 
  so we have some general indicators for this , but the one people use the most is trading volume - how much is traded vs. how much is consumed . 
  so if a country consumes 1bcm ( billion cubic metres ) of gas and trades 20bcm of gas then that 's a good sign that this country has a liquid market and therefore a good price reference . 
  the more people trade on a market , the more others want to as well , so this self-reinforces to some extent . 
  [ in this chart ] ( http://www.timera-energy.com/content/uploads/2014/11/hub-liquidity-2014.jpg ) we have britain in blue and the netherlands in pink - both very dominant . 
  yet their gas consumption is not this much higher than other european companies . 
  the chart is referring to how much gas is traded before it 's passed onto the consumer . 
  more trade = better price reference . 
  so what are some things that a hub needs to become more liquid ? 
  these are some indicators : * low transaction costs . 
  * speed that buy/sell orders are carried out . 
  * volume of orders ( and minimal price impact ) . 
  * how fast the market corrects supply/demand imbalances . 
  * open display of information , and lack of barriers . 
  * ease to hedge with range of products ( i.e. 
  [ derivatives ] ( http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/derivative_ ( finance ) ) it 's also important to have : * laws and regulation that encourage trade , break up monopolies ( like the old british gas ) * a mix of different gas so not just russian gas ( the uk has domestic , russian , norwegian , qatari , algerian etc. ), 
  * good infrastructure ( uk can import/export gas to the continent , has the tools to import gas from boats , a good pipeline network with lots of capacity ) * a good market ( uk/netherlands have long history of trading cultures , have sufficiently big enough markets , and competition from both importers and exporters ) . 
  hope this was n't too long !, 
  i 'm also trying to work on explaining all of this in a simpler fashion , as when i first started learning about gas hubs/markets this was difficult for me , so do ask if i have n't explained anything well enough . 
  http://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-american-tanks-found-in-donbas/ too crazy for rt , just enough for zvezda ? 
  edit : does anybody have a website like stopfake.org that looks at the propaganda of both sides ? 
  russia is n't included sorry , but i know a few ( more middle class ) russians who like central asians because of the cheap labour . 
  people also overestimate how many muslims actually live in their country http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2015/01/blogs/graphic-detail/20150110_gdc999_3.png,

   after he became president he was very kind to communists , saying poland needs both lft and right politicians this does n't necessarily make him a communist agent , and [ follows south africa 's peaceful transition of reconciliation ] ( http://www.sol.com.au/kor/19_03.htm ) . 
   look at germany 's energy politics could you outline what exactly is wrong with german 's energy politics and perhaps why merkel/others pursued this policy ? 
  equally , it could be putting things into perspective for russia 's current state of freedom and could explain why people like solzhenitsyn who suffered in the soviet union could support him . 
  well the church and [ column ] ( http://www.saint-petersburg.com/images/monuments/rostral-columns/early-morning-view-of-the-rostral-columns-in-st-petersburg.jpg ) are there .
