  so currently [ there are two pricing models ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5efz1ew.png ) in europe for gas , oil-indexed pricing ( which is what gazprom generally favours ) and hub-indexed or ` market ' pricing ( which is what the eu generally favours ) . 
  these prices can converge sometimes , but hub have historically been lower ( only recently higher because of oil price crash ) . 
  oil-indexed is gas at a price related to a basket of oil-derived products , so it goes up or down with the price of oil . 
  this made sense in the '70s when gas and oil competed for power use but not so much anymore where the arguments for it are [ stability etc ] ( http://www.arcticgas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2013-1-11-gazprom-paper-gas-pricing.pdf ) . 
  hub/market-indexed pricing is where gas is priced based on supply and demand at [ various ` hubs ' or regional markets ] ( http://www.erih.com.tr/imagess/gas_clip_image001.gif ) . 
  in an efficient and liquid hub-based market , the price will serve as a true reference point for gas supply and demand , and the only difference in cost throughout europe would be the cost of transportation between markets . 
  currently the majority of hubs in europe ( except the british and dutch ) do n't really serve as true reference points and there is a * lot * of work to be done . 
  still , i think having a single price for gas is a bad idea , because for some countries such as the uk there already is a mature market and a good market price , and end-users throughout most of europe are going to be screwed over by artificial prices . 
  of course , some eastern countries pay very high prices for gas , so bear this in mind when different politicians hold different views on it . 
  what do armenians think about their energy dependence on russia ? 
  edit : follow up question , gas imports from iran and reliance on nuclear power, 
  do you have a source in english ? 
  for personal reading , not doubting you . 
  i do n't think so , but everyone has a price right ? 
  i think it 's / u/qtx actually , just found this in their comment history http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2h8qip/modpost_askreddit_gets_a_facelift/ckqe5kt?context=3 so it definitely is . 
   let 's hear them ramblings about how it 's definitely not putin 's bots yes , because an italian that is bitter against the germans is obviously actually a russian shill . 
  greece will need some onshore pipelines on their side of the adriatic though , going up to cegh . 
  well they 'd lose out on their transit fees from russia if it forms an alternative , so i can see why they 'd be upset from a business standpoint . 
  same , i could n't remember the user 's name but they did / r/books and / r/videos too iirc and i thought that they seemed to take into account the ` mood ' of a subreddit fairly well . 
  i like / r/europe 's current theme anyway though , definitely more than / r/turkey 's . 
  i 'm pretty sure nord stream was n't financed by the eu , and the eu limits it to only 50 % capacity under gazprom 's export monopoly . 
  except developing greek interconnectors will give europe a chance to benefit from iranian and possibly east med gas which is reducing dependence on russia . 
  part of europe 's gas target model is based on these interconnections anyway , as it means eu states with higher import capacity can help these small eu countries . 
  why ? 
  edit : nobody 's talking about the eu funding the russian pipeline , they 're talking about interconnectors between greece and other s-e eu states . 
  check [ this map ] ( http://www.entsog.eu/public/uploads/files/maps/transmissioncapacity/2014/entsog_140612_cap_june2014.pdf ) and compare infrastructure in greece and its neighbours with nw europe for example . 
  the guy who made the new / r/askreddit and some other defaults is pretty solid . 
   `` interconnecting the natural gas infrastructures of our countries with european union financial assistance '' . 
  this is important , greece has a [ lack of cross-border infrastructure ] ( http://www.entsog.eu/public/uploads/files/maps/transmissioncapacity/2014/entsog_140612_cap_june2014.pdf ) that would allow it to be a transit state for russian gas . 
  if it wants to change this , it needs somebody to foot the bill . 
   he added that when it 's built , he will stop supplies to the eu via ukraine and that if the eu wants the russian gas to keep flowing it should pay for interconnectors to link south-eastern europe , which relies on russian supplies for close to 100 percent of its needs , to the greek-turkish outlet . 
  gazprom wants to avoid ukraine for obvious reasons , but the contracts state a delivery point which they ca n't change immediately . 
  having an export gas hub in turkey could possibly let them walk past eu competition laws . 
  the map was [ published based on data from the ilo ] ( http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_316450.pdf ) , a separate organisation . 
  it 's an indicator , i mean if you have women making up less than 20 % of people in charge then there 's clearly something going on . 
  ok cheers , 
  do n't know about france , but i 'm pretty sure if both your parents are british citizens you get citizenship . 
  i like how strasbourg cathedral is surrounded by the older parts of the city too , you can only see modern buildings like the university/parliament from the top . 
  marko alexandrovich ramius , the main character in the hunt for red october was lithuanian too . 
  makes sense that her parents had a house in france then , 
  not what the eu fact finding report found - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/responsibility_for_the_russo-georgian_war#eu_independent_fact_finding_mission_report and let 's not forget that , unlike crimea , there had been a long history of tensions on the north/south ossetian border . 
   and georgians are well known for their hot temper , that shall also be taken into account . 
  sounds a bit racist \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   70 % russian , 30 % ukrainian-speaking what 's the % that can hold a conversation in russian in ukraine ? 
  `` decrease of 1 % compared to 2013 '' , so this is * change * in road deaths in the eu then ? 
  something zombie horror fps called afterfall apparently http://blog.wirebot.com/2010/04/06/new-third-person-shooter-based-in-afterfall-universe-announced/, 
  this is a transformation the gas markets are going to be going through too , provided they build the infrastructure to go along with it . 
  it 's ugly but it tells me what i need to know quickly and succinctly . 
  there are worse slides out there , trust me . 
  that might be because the definition of ` proven ' reserves is based on the oil/gas reserves being economical at whatever the market prices currently are . 
  if you think it is so wrong then you should change the source on wikipedia . 
  though the proficiency index you cited is just from one language learning company and the one wikipedia already cited is from the eu . 
  also my original source was countrywide i could n't find one for just tallinn sorry it may well be 80 % : /, 
  the question you responded to was if i already tried speaking english and they did n't understand . 
  it says here that russian [ is the most widely spoken foreign language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_estonia ) at 66 % , and english at 46 % from the same source [ is okay ] ( http://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/english-eu.jpg ) . 
  and i 'm guessing that the people who do n't speak english probably speak russian instead . 
  would most russians live outside the big cities though near the russian borders though ? 
  if i 'm going to estonia it would probably be to the people i know in tallinn . 
  why ? 
  most estonians i know speak russian and do n't really care . 
  the siloviki connection would matter , i have to admit i did n't know that . 
  and thanks for the answer . 
  in what ways has abkhazia been less subservient specifically ? 
  sorry for asking so many questions that might seem obvious to you . 
  why do you think they chose now to incorporate south ossetia ? 
  was there any signs of dissatisfaction with the local leaders there from the kremlin ? 
  if i 'm an english speaking tourist , and someone does n't understand english and i speak to them in broken russian would that be offensive to them ? 
  judging by your reaction , i should say that i did n't mean to paint a pretty picture . 
  a month ago i was laughing about citibank 's $ 20 estimate , and now i 'm wondering if they knew something back then that we did n't . 
  the break-even for a lot of projects are a lot lower than we had previously thought they were , and what you said about [ the drop in rig count ] ( http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=79687&amp;p=irol-rigcountsoverview ) and rise in production is also important when talking about shale and its impacts . 
  as for russia , the government is screwed if 1 ) the sanctions stay in place beyond 2015 and 2 ) the oil price does n't hit $ 100 . 
  whilst i think a lot of the private companies will stay afloat ( then again , even rosneft has big debt problems it can not pay ) , this will come at a big price for the rest of the economy . 
  i think that russia 's business environment is not suited for investment into energy extraction , and putin is not the kind of person to reform unless it 's a really really big crisis . 
  i agree with you on markets . 
  i 'm pretty sure it was dismissed as tongue in cheek too . 
  do n't get me wrong , people are cultish about politicians in russia though . 
  on sunday i saw a framed photo of medvedev for sale in a bookshop . 
   who stands aside from politics [ not quite ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/14/secret-papers-royals-veto-bills ) , this is common knowledge . 
  and charles ... ? 
  most art exhibitions are government sponsored , are they endorsed though ? 
  it looks tongue in cheek . 
   they ca n't import the requisite technology to maintain oil production this is [ more of a mid-term effect ] ( http://rogtecmagazine.com/russian-drilling-market-paradigm-shift/ ) , and is dependent on how long sanctions are going to last . 
  it will be a big productivity hit for russian drilling , but the lack of investment will be a bigger concern . 
  in the short term the lack of western software would be a big issue , but this is something that can be much easier fixed by domestic developers ( given 1-3 years from estimates i 've heard this week ) . 
   if oil prices were to jump to $ 100 + in the next three months definitely not going to happen . 
  they 'd be lucky if prices got to $ 85 by summertime . 
  compare the rig count in the us with their output , tight oil is having a hell of a lot more impact on the market than nearly anyone could have imagined 6 months ago . 
  i 've also been keeping a near hourly eye ( ok , daily on weekdays ) on the ruble since last august , and it 's stabilised a lot recently . 
  stabilised at near half its value but still , this might be a sign that the markets have adjusted to sanctions already . 
  not if they 're being racist/sectarian/sexist ... 
  pressed on which discrimination laws he would get rid of , the ukip leader said : `` much of it . 
  i think the employer should be much freer to make decisions on who he or she employs . '' asked whether there would be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour under ukip , farage added : `` no ... because we take the view , we are colour-blind . 
  we as a party are colour-blind . '', 
  i assumed that they were intending an indirect ban on foreign language tv channels ( e.g. 
  al-jazeera arabic or indian news ) . 
  if they wanted to ban satellite tv as a luxury they would ban cable too right ? 
  crimea , along with the whole khodorkovsky affair , were two of the biggest wins for putin in terms of popularity . 
  it 's not just a desire for the putin legacy , but keeping in power and being safe from possible indictment . 
  i was more scared of falling icicles in recent weeks : s http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/7512865/falling-icicles-kill-record-numbers-in-st-petersburg.html, 
  with a strong resolve they can become more independent and still maintain ties , e.g.
