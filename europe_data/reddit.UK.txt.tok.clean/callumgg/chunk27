  wish them good morning and continue my normal walk to work . 
  nb : i 'm living in st. petersburg at the moment . 
  they 're attacking the symptom , not the cause !, 
  [ these have been in paris since the 1800s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pissoir ) . 
  did you learn british english or american english ( assuming your first language is romanian ) ? 
  xpost / r/energypolitics  warsaw will this week push the eu to loosen rules on state subsidies for poland 's ailing but politically-sensitive coal mines in a bold election-year gambit that defies the bloc 's public embrace of green energy .

  the times of israel [ paints wilders ' relationship with le pen as a big problem ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/is-the-honeymoon-over-for-geert-wilders-and-dutch-jews/ ) for his jewish supporters . 
  wilders lived in israel , and has made very * very * strong statements in support of the state . 
  le pen has not gone this far . 
  if you genuinely want to understand a perspective from the other side of the fence [ this article is probably one of the best i 've seen that actually attempts to explain it ] ( https://medium.com/@juliaserano/that-joke-isn-t-funny-anymore-and-it-s-not-because-of-political-correctness-469b92312536#.8yg4tbwhc ) rather than just shout loud about oppression . 
  i might be reading this wrong but i think you have a higher chance of approval in the uk http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitviewtableaction.do also there may be iraqis and africans there who speak english and not french . 
  so , isle of man ? 
  reddit was temporarily blocked for illegal drugs advice . 
  edit : full story by bbc http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33756427 does not match up with what you 're ` pretty sure ' about . 
  and then there 's saoirse ( [ seer-shuh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zncxvlhyv-y ) ) which some people pronounce ( ser-shuh ) also . 
  however , charles is excluded from certain laws :  the title of duke of cornwall excludes the prince from punishment from a number of laws , including the nuclear explosions act , the data protection act and the wildlife and countryside act . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/obscure-law-lets-prince-charles-set-off-nuclear-bomb-a6787626.html ) i think he is also now exempt from the freedom of information act . 
  nice , thanks !, 
  looks like they might be focusing more on tourists which is a good idea . 
  is that going to tfl or to paying off the loans ( gla funded ? ), 
  that they used to start up ? 
  is it turning a profit ? 
  and who 's getting the profit ? 
  how was the question for estonia phrased ? 
  maybe they see emigration as part of the issue of immigration . 
  you 're playing a lottery for a neutral or non-divisive monarch also . 
  look at spain 's royals or charles windsor . 
  also the assumption it makes about russia being separatist from europe as a continent is funny . 
  oh i get what you 're saying . 
  yeah , i do n't think it 's very feminist to decry masculine behaviours as toxic purely because they conform with male gender roles . 
  masculinity is n't inherently patriarchal , and femininity is n't inherently submissive . 
  it should be up to the individual to express themselves in whatever masculine/feminine way they want . 
  if a girl or guy does n't want to conform to the standard of open emotional expression then they should be free to do so without judgement . 
  i think this is a simplification of stoicism that presents it as a way of ignoring emotions . 
  it just means not being attached to a particular state or external , and knowing what is in our control and what is n't . 
  there 's nothing inherently wrong with crying as a stoic . 
  given a certain stimulus/state , you have about as much control over crying as sneezing . 
  it 's what stoics would call an indifferent ; a side-effect to some root cause . 
  nobody should expect a little child to be a stoic sage , and you could argue that many of the things we deem to be in our control as adults are not when we are children . 
  sounds like quite a good system . 
  ca n't be that hard to learn finnish right ? 
  assuming classes are n't too big . 
  i 'd say 75 % is pretty accurate for the uk . 
  if the results were collected anonymously then there should be less bias . 
  i 'd prefer doggerland . 
  netherlands and london would mesh well together i reckon . 
  if we ca n't trust gallup polling then do you just not trust any polls at all ? 
  so the results could be better , but , caveat from the creator :  `` [ it ] is not intended in any way to represent meaningful units of government , at any point in time . 
  this map was made ( 1 ) for fun and ( 2 ) to draw attention to the massive imbalance between member states at the commission level . '', 
  i like how most of them are variants of school/church , main/central , forest/tree , and then there 's italy with rome , garibaldi , and marconi , 
  pretty much . 
  it 's not impossible to hold a trial in absentia . 
  with all the evidence we have it would be a very symbolic `` we 're coming for you '' sort of deal . 
  here 's what corbyn said in context :  `` we await identification of the person targeted in last night 's us air attack in syria . 
  it appears mohammed emwazi has been held to account for his brutal and callous crimes . 
  however , it would have been far better for us all if he had been held to account in a court of law . 
  these events only underline the necessity of accelerating international efforts , under the auspices of the un , to bring an end to the syrian conflict as part of a comprehensive regional settlement . '' i was n't agreeing with the point , i just thought it was interesting . 
  like when thatcher treated the ira as criminals it delegitimised them somewhat . 
  also i do n't think anyone 's advocating that we handcuff terrorists in the middle of a war zone . 
  a trial would likely yield the same result as no trial , it would just be consistent with republican ideals . 
  was also a british citizen and a trial in absentia would be more like us putting it down on paper why we 're going after him . 
  plus , the uk does n't recognise the legitimacy of the islamic state so maybe there 's a point to be made on criminality there ? 
  a trial in absentia is impractical ? 
  he was a british citizen , i think it would 've been very symbolic to have a trial and then pass verdict and basically say `` we 're coming for you '' . 
   maybe they can still give his corpse a trial that 's not what a trial in absentia is . 
   anyway , the guy was with an enemy military and he is seen executing people . 
  so it really should n't be hard to get the desired verdict in a trial . 
  more gas , but not very significant . 
  i wonder what the tax paid for the new lng terminal is . 
  the statue looks nice . 
  they did say ` seem to ' , almost like they were just relaying a personal experience and avoiding a generalisation . 
  i say this as someone who is against eu unaccountability . 
  yeah i was n't explaining it to you ( i assumed you knew ) but just putting it out there \u263a, 
  society tends to assume everyone is male by default anyway . 
  that 's why when someone makes a joke and the protagonist is a woman , there 's assumed to be a reason why they would specifically choose a woman over a man to be the main character ( as it 's a ` detail ' that could otherwise detract from the joke ) . 
  reminds me of this levitan painting - https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/1885-1889_birkenhain.jpg also this - http://i.imgur.com/vdgsfwc.jpg - won an award for world press photo 1984 , photographed in an area close to finland i think . 
  ridiculously !, 
  plus they take ages apparently . 
  i always thought it was k\u00e9k\u00e9 . 
  to put this in perspective , you 're below russia according to the [ source for this article ] ( http://thelearningcurve.pearson.com/index/index-ranking/overall-score-highest ) . 
  no need for your gif to be condescending . 
  retaliation probably means restrictive visas , the reality is a lot more boring . 
  thanks a lot . 
  if you 're on a phone anyway could we continue this ~ midday tomorrow ? 
  i have work i 'm late with due before then . 
  just realised you 're the same person that i 'm commenting with in the other thread , let 's stick to that one . 
  the governor is the queen 's representative , nobody else 's and as the majority of parliament were obstructed by the queen in their vote it would seem that they do n't have the same right or they would have prorogued her from proroguing them . 
  i think the fact that : 1 . 
  you call them colonies , 2 . 
  elizabeth dissolved one parliament and prorogued the other , demonstrate that you do n't think they have real independence anyway . 
  they have pretty much the same system , do n't be so sure !, 
  same queen , she does n't count as a separate person for each country she owns . 
  not in australia or canada apparently . 
  i gave two examples , the first happening in australia in 1975 where the queen dissolved parliament and the second happening in 2008 where the conservative government asked for [ the queen to temporarily shut down the parliament to avoid a vote of no confidence by the opposition majority . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/12/04/us-politics-canada-idustre4b34bc20081204 ) if you 're trying to deny that they happened it 's not hard to google , [ here are real pictures of protests ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:whitlam_dismissal_19751111_sydney.jpg ) from [ australia in 1975 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:domain_19751124.jpg ) that 's not counting the behind-closed-doors issues with charles etc. 
  it feels like you did n't really get what i was saying in the 2nd point . 
  power to appoint the pm , power to dissolve gov ` t , dismiss gov ' t ( last happened in 1975 ) , withhold royal assent , and forcing recess in gov ' t ( lasted several weeks in 2008 , without a replacement gov ` t ) .
