  not only that but influence , see the recent scandal with charles . 
  why do i need to defend and you do n't ? 
  there are n't facts to back up the tourism debate , so how can i give a source to show the contrary . 
  royal palaces and homes could fare better without the queen , as versailles , the louvre and the tower of london have shown . 
  buckingham palace would bring in a lot of money if it were fully open to the public along with its galleries . 
  apparently [ the head of visitbritain said that there would be no reason to suggest that tourism would suffer if the monarchy were to disappear according to this article ] ( http://www.cnn.co.uk/2012/05/30/world/europe/uk-jubilee-republicans/index.html ), 
  yeah i worded that badly : /, 
  you were so lucky . 
  go talk about religion on / r/atheism then . 
  the point of subreddit is to have places to talk about separate interests . 
  yes , i was just being overly general myself . 
  no that 's definitely my fault , and i ca n't blame the computer for that . 
  i 'm not even going to format it so i do n't risk screwing up again !, 
  http://www.visitengland.org/insight-statistics/major-tourism-surveys/attractions/annual_survey/ the pdfs date from 2000-11 , so it 's likely that republic could 've just cherrypicked but i do n't know . 
  norway has the highest hourly productivity according to statistics too , and we all know that 's quite a lot to do with the oil . 
  lies , damned lies , and statistics . 
  i assume this is where it came from , but it 's all pdfs and too slow for my computer in this library . 
  i did n't know that , thanks !, 
  at least / r/europe is relatively safe from those people . 
  plus , there 's always / r/republicanism as a last resort . 
  also [ the first one rebutted here  ] ( http://www.republic.org.uk/what%20we%20want/win%20the%20argument/index.php ), 
  actually the greeks have an average of 2,032 hours worked per person , which is the 3rd highest out of the oecd . 
  compare this to the united states which has an average of 1,787 or germany which has 1,411 . 
  [ check the source for similar revelations about the portuguese etc. 
  ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=level# ), 
  the sad thing is that i do n't know if that is sarcasm/not . 
  tourism revenue is not only completely irrelevant to a debate about our constitution , it 's just simply untrue . 
  i guess that settles it then !, 
  i completely agree , but having themselves locked into microsoft systems that seem to not really work on other browsers every time it gets updated was n't a good move . 
  from primary school right through to university , ie is locked as default in the uk . 
  considering a lot of them were actually colonists , you could just call them invaders instead . 
  what do you think are the boundaries of europe then ? 
  would somewhere like georgia be european or asian ? 
  remember that somewhere like russia has a * very * small sample size here . 
  there were different views of how to transition from communism . 
  shock therapy , which is what russia and poland did was n't viewed as well back then as it is now and making a gradual and slow transition to capitalism seemed favourable to some people - it does n't make them communist . 
  edit : [ see here for some cold hard data  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/da2wd ), 
  that makes sense , thanks for the answer . 
  also would n't they have to marry first if they 're in the vatican ? 
  there must be a separate age of consent for marriage . 
  ok you 're right , i 'm wrong and so are lots of people [ on this google search ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=right-wing+populism&amp;oq=right-wing+populism&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=right-wing+populism+zhirinovsky&amp;oq=right-wing+populism+zhirin&amp;gs_l=serp.3.0.35i39.15756.16483.0.17320.7.7.0.0.0.0.164.785.3j4.7.0.les%3beqrwrth..0.0...1.1.xqlis35kasq&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=b7fd18220ebaaf5a&amp;bpcl=37189454&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=679 ) ( from russia today to foreign policy ) .

  there 's not even such a thing as a spectrum of how right/left-wing someone is , it 's just up to you two .

  i 'm also a bit insulted you saying that he 's not that different from me . . 
  i never tried to take sides , sorry if it appeared that way . 
   there were no good sides in wwii wise words . 
  see [ vladimir zhirinovsky 's quotes here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_zhirinovsky#racist_remarks ) , he 's head of the liberal democratic party of russia which is hilariously actually fascist and right-wing . 
  that did n't stop bloggers confusing it with the actually liberal protestors . 
  rus . 
  here , fuck those nazis . 
  my family was slaughtered in be\u0142\u017cec . 
  quite the opposite actually . 
  they 're just adopting western norms and values like internet censorship  to be honest though , i do n't think their opportunity is squandered and certainly not squandered because of putin . 
  firstly , his ( successors ) will be * civiliki * not * siloviki * who are more liberal and progressive ( not as popular but popular enough to win a majority ) . 
  putin wo n't live forever , and he 's getting old now . 
  secondly , the current government is n't as bad as you might think . 
  of course what happened with the censorship makes me angry , but overall it 's been good . 
  russia under yeltsin was terrible , ruled by the oligarchs ( the 1996 election was pretty unequivocally declared rigged recently ) , a doa judiciary , and enormous economic problems . 
  fast forward 10 years and you have comparatively free and fair elections ( as evidenced by international polls for example ) , poverty rates more than halved and wages nearly tripled , an extremely low amount of government debt , a more influential and economically powerful russia . 
  on democracy and human rights , according to the bbc world service :  64 % of russians think putin has had a positive influence on democracy and human rights , while only 3 % think it was ` very negative ' if you 've got any reservations though , feel free to talk them out . 
  i call it the ' 20th century mindset ' , 
   they hoped that over time , modernization would infiltrate the political system to make it more democratic and accountable . 
    that has not happened . 
  says who ? 
   it 's a miracle the country survived the yeltsin years , when the nation was looted by `` former '' communist apparatchiks who seized control of the nation 's resources in a series of rigged `` privatizations . '' there is hardly any democratic tradition in russia , and liberalism is a minority viewpoint rather than the majority mindset : long-standing habits die hard , particularly in a nation as mired in history and tragedy as russia . 
  given all this , it 's amazing they have elections -- relatively free and open ones -- in russia at all . 
  it was n't so long ago that stalin 's gulags held millions . 
  now judy dempsey wants us to break ties over pussy riot ? 
  it may be more economically stable , but it does n't have such a good quality of life . 
  also '' * cursed by rampant muslim * '' , ** wtf ** ? 
  it 's a shame it did n't slow down the jump in the last 100 years , missing a lot of change more relevant to us today . 
  i put funniest accent for vatican , mainly because a vatican accent could potentially sound hilarious !, 
  a dictatorship is a huge accusation . 
  in russia there is a clear problem of a stagnating democracy , which is due to a weak opposition . 
  there has only been a recent history of elections , and an even more recent history of comparatively fair elections . 
  if you 're accusing putin of being undemocratic , then you 're accusing him of being completely irrational because : 1 . 
  public opinion polls correlate with the end results ( even international neutral polls ) so there is no need . 
  the popular opposition to putin is communist and there are enough people who hate communism to tolerate putin doing a lot of things he sees as right just because he 's not a stalinist . 
  also i picked belarus too !, 
  british republicanism is n't * that * small . 
  the / r/republicanism subreddit is though ( for now ) . 
   opinion polls consistently put support for a republic at around 20 % ( various mori polls ) , and some have put it as high as 43 % ( gmtv/mirror 2008 ) . 
  that means that at least 10 million people would vote to abolish the monarchy - the same number that voted for the winning party at our last general election . 
    there has also been a steady increase in the number of people who do not think the monarchy will survive in the long term . 
  a 2002 poll showed that 70 % believe britain will be a republic within 50 years ( mori 2002 ) . 
  it 's gone a long way , i 'd say never is a bit harsh . 
  * all * faith ? 
  turkey shares a common history with europe , it 's mostly subjective though what countries are ` europe ' . 
  you should start with what you see as inherently ` european ' and then see from there . 
  sorry i was n't very clear , i mean the borders of anatolia and caucasus rather than them being borders themselves - so yes to turkey !, 
  if you 're asking a question like this you 're going to get arbitrary answers . 
  i for one see europe 's boundaries as the mediterranean in the south , the atlantic to the west . 
  anatolia , the caucasus , and the urals to the east .
