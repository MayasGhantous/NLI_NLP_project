  any country that holds their administrative centre ( capital ) in these boundaries are fair game in my book . 
  good one !, 
  i 'm using that !, 
  strange , i moved there from west london . 
  what kind of music are they ? 
  putin had a comparable relationship with bush pre-iraq though , and nobody 's calling russia the 52nd state . 
  i reckon matrisylva might mean a more integrated eu . 
  yeah he probably would 've !, 
  good thing he 's dead i guess :d, 
  what about cincinnati too ? 
  i wrote something about the man who it was named after in my sub ( / r/republicanism ) and found that out . 
  cincinnatus was from italy , so by some people 's logic americans are n't allowed to use his name or any derivatives ? 
  it would buy you # 10-15 at a bureau de change , and maybe some decent jeans at h & m. 
  i found [ another picture like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/europa-bei-nacht_1-1024x768.jpg ) on wikipedia that seems to be brighter . 
  i suppose the lack of a clear sense of the geographical boundaries in europe mirrors the political form that europe 's taking as a magnetic field . 
  russia , azerbaijan , and armenia are not external but peripheral ; and their desire to be accepted as european shows that . 
  i do n't know if anyone else has this feeling , but in certain areas ( such as eastern europe ) i feel there is n't a single border but a thinning out at least currently . 
  the [ cia world factbook thinks it is ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/europe_subregion_map_world_factbook.svg/680px-europe_subregion_map_world_factbook.svg.png ) , as does [ the council of europe ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/map-coeurope.jpg ) , the [ bbc ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/country_profiles/default.stm ) ( under europe ) , and [ world atlas ] ( http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/eu.htm ) . 
  kaliningrad surprised me too , a bit harsh in my opinion . 
  much better than politicalcompass . 
  [ ^ own ^ result . 
  ] ( http://www.politicaltest.net/test/graphic2/153626_eng.jpg ), 
  there was an interesting [ discussion here on this that drew comparisons closer to home in case ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ymsxc/the_wests_hypocrisy_over_pussy_riot_is/c5x00mx ) anybody missed out on it . 
  ooops , i was just looking at the comments . 
  my bad !, 
  i do n't think anyone 's linked [ presseurop ] ( http://www.presseurop.eu/en ) ( available in 10 languages ) which is a true shame given the relevance to this subreddit :  presseurop.eu is a paris-based news website publishing a daily selection of articles chosen from more than 200 international news titles , then translated into ten languages ( english , german , french , spanish , romanian , italian , portuguese , dutch , polish and czech ) . 
    financially supported by the european commission , presseurop.eu was established in 2009 by a consortium of four magazines specialising in international news : courrier international ( paris ) , courrier internacional ( lisbon ) , forum ( warsaw ) , and internazionale ( rome ) . 
  its multilingual team enjoys complete editorial independence . 
  also [ le figaro \\ ( big centre-right french newspaper \\ ) occasionally has articles in english ] ( http://plus.lefigaro.fr/cercle/le-figaro-in-english ) . 
  i 'd recommend [ ria novosti ] ( http://en.rian.ru/ ) over pravda , it 's not as cringeworthy as some of pravda 's articles . 
  every news agency has problems with bias , you just have to know where it is . 
  i think rt 's good there because it 's blatant enough to be in the title , the ones where i ca n't see their agenda are the ones i worry about . 
  [ this is the spanish side of spanglish . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsxd5vf7wea ), 
  they could 've done the exact same thing in a mosque and not get arrested . 
  patriarch kirill holds way too much power in the judiciary . 
  very good article , but i 'm not sure on some things . 
  for a start , the pussy riot trial is more naunced than they think . 
  putin does n't want this , and this is putting him in a bad position between appeasing liberals and conservatives ( without either he ca n't command the same popularity as he does today ) . 
  they 're being tried because they were in a church playing the music , and religion holds a lot of sway in the legal system sadly . 
  deutsche welle ( as someone in the uk ) is something i 've never heard of , is it bigger in other countries ? 
  you should take into account the number of athletes sent as well . 
  it started when srd was linking srs drama , and ended up making threads like [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ulnsj/til_that_as_of_april_2010_bill_gates_had_donated/c4wq39e?context=3 ) where there were loads of bots and counter-bots etc. 
  if you 're interested check out [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/search?q=bot&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance ) . 
  apparently this bot was created by srs against srd , so that may be why you 're being downvoted . 
  read the last paragraph again . 
  i do n't see the soviets as representative of russians , but thank you for clarifying . 
  the soviets were in no way provoked , and they had no right to intervene in a country 's civil war . 
  what do you mean ? 
  how is russia being hostile here ? 
  [ they do n't want to get involved in the war . 
  ] ( http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/21/russias-rational-and-moral-stance-on-syria/ ), 
  afghans fought against soviets ( edit : i do n't see the russian federation as responsible for the soviets but admittedly that is subjective ) , [ georgians were the aggressors ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/30_09_09_iiffmgc_report.pdf ) , and chechens provoked . 
  but why is eastern europe different from any other place in the world ? 
  why is communism the cause there when it is n't elsewhere ? 
  you did n't respond to my point , you downvoted it at the same time you posted . 
  i 'm not going to reply to yours unless you tell me how ( and i repeat ) it is different to the bigotry that used to be more common in western europe , that still has a presence in america , and other places like uganda . 
  yet people still think she earns us money . . 
  so the catholics in western europe and christians in america that are bigoted are only so because of communism ? 
  i 'm religious myself so i 'm not trying to say religion in itself is bad , just that communism did n't make it that way . 
  edit : also why is tymoshenko a ` corrupt fuck ' ? 
  the president before the current president was yulia tymoshenko . 
  she [ was imprisoned for ` abuse of office ' , a mock trial which ironically was made as an abuse of office by the incumbent . 
  ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/ukraine-investigates-tymoshenko-over-russia-gas-de.html#.ua8wkdfssuc ) putin [ said that they had a `` clear anti-russian subtext '' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15250742 ) . 
  i 'm just saying this here so people do n't blame the wrong source , the problem in eastern europe is the history of orthodox influence . 
  yes , there are plenty of other reasons why ukraine is underdeveloped and backward . 
  even if it 's really basic , people appreciate you making an effort . 
  the amount of times i 've been given discounts in shops for trying to speak a foreign language . 
   a certificate of debt , found in a regional archive , attests that mittenwalde lent berlin 400 guilders on may 28 1562 , * to be repaid with six percent interest per year . 
  if you can make it to ireland some day do n't forget northern ireland , with the giant 's causeway and belfast . 
  where 's countvontroll when you need him ? 
  socialism for the rich is a better way of putting it . 
  i 'm not taking sides here , it just sounds better . 
  ha , i wish i 'd gone to the comments first before trying google translate . 
  if the * jubilee * was better then that 's saying quite a lot . 
  well there 's hope yet , i managed to found duck pate in belfast . 
  and the considerable lack of saucisson too !, 
  do you think your perspective is different from the rest of the uk as your flag is of gibraltar ? 
  it costs ~ 90p for a baguette in britain , and more for an actual loaf . 
  i do n't see the problem with that . 
  ideally it would be a neutral language , but we 've got to work with what we 've got . 
  it is n't an original idea for a film , but it 's very well made and well worth a watch - probably my favourite war film but i have n't seen * apocalypse now * yet . 
  if you can find a copy with subtitles go for it !, 
  i know the film is in russian , and the subtitles do look polish , 
  i remember a quote from the 9th company - * `` in all of history , no one has ever managed to conquer afghanistan '' * *** source : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjkvab0i2fa ( not in english ), 
  obviously i 'm very sorry i went off topic . . 
  i do n't actually know . 
  i was drunk , [ see here . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/drunk/comments/qqq1v/drunk_on_gin_tonics_and_cocktails_like_a_true_sir/ ) i think i was trying to say that monarchies take away liberty , but i ca n't see what i was responding to . 
  there 's more to liberty than lgbt rights . 
  the one point where not having a monarch would make us * more * liberal . 
  i do n't think we 'd have europe as integrated as it is now without kohl . 
  i see the european union as an important framework for * pooling * sovereignty rather than * ceding * it , all nations still have autonomy but they can work together formally . 
  this game has two ` roles ' , and is played through the mail with a number of other redditors . 
  the first role is the donor , who buys a notebook and customises it/makes their mark , and then sends it off to another redditor . 
  the second role is the relay , who receives a notebook and makes their own mark before sending it to the next person . 
  this continues as a chain until one donor 's notebook ends up in the mailbox of another 's . 
  it would be fun for notebook fans or anybody with a creative flair , or is into arts and crafts . 
  right now , we have filled the quota for the ` donor ' roles , and are just trying to get more people as relays . 
  europe , australia , s.e.
