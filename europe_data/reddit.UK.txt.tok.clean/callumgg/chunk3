  do go ahead and criticize israel . 
  do n't use anti-semitic stereotypes or tropes . 
  ** do n't use overly expansive language that covers jews as a whole and not just israel ** . 
  do n't use lies to boost your claims . 
  do engage jews in conversation on the issues of israel and of anti-semitism , rather than simply shutting them down for disagreeing . 
  ** do try to be sensitive to the fact that , fair or not , many people take verbal or violent revenge for the actions of israelis on diasporan jews , and diasporan jews are understandably frightened and upset by this ** . 
  the article makes t0t0zenerd 's point actually . 
  i think you must have skim read it . 
  itt : we 're not racist , it 's the muslims !, 
  edit : thankfully the mods have nuked the more obvious examples . 
  / r/europe has issues . 
  yes thinking this basically means that the target group will always be thought of as foreign agents . 
  it would more be associating all jews with israel . 
  the article is talking about the incidence of actual hate crimes etc on european jews though . 
  no idea sorry , hopefully someone else with more knowledge chimes in . 
  why is this navel gazing and why are you so amazed ? 
  oh sorry about that . 
  was n't it because of boeing not servicing them or something ? 
  might 've been stansted . 
  it was definitely strasbourg though , not basel, 
  well if you did n't read the article . 
  this article gives four different points of view , are you saying that all of them are badly written or just the ones you agree/disagree with ? 
   russian media outlets on the other hand would never criticise the russian government for fear of retaliation ( journalists being murdered in russia is common ) and would also not ask important questions like `` are we being objective '' . 
  the problem with russian media is n't that opposition media does n't exist , it 's that this private media is drowned out by the presence of state media . 
  you can perfectly well go and subscribe to a rabidly anti-government paper but pro-incumbency is the ` default ' . 
  of course we think that western media has better journalism , they do n't have the legacy of an oppressive garrison state but for some ( like the uk ) hundreds of years as the fourth estate . 
  at the same time , just asking these questions or being better than russian media ( what kind of comparison is that ? ), 
  will do . 
  there are journalists with a cold war mentality , and there are many misconceptions of russia that are both positive and negative but create a narrative that 's disconnected from reality . 
  would it still be flying if this were in soviet/collapse times ? 
  i do n't think / u/toxirine would just make that up , maybe the seat was rattling or something and it was exaggeration ? 
  i 've got that before on ryanair ( lhr to sxb ) and it was pretty annoying but i knew it was n't a safety concern . 
  the four different opinions . 
  * tony brenton : western media should do better * james nixey : true objectivity is impossible * gregory feifer : putin alone is responsible for his cold war caricature * nabi abdullaev : biased journalism robs the west of its moral authority [ other discussions of the same article on reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/duplicates/2coeph/is_western_media_coverage_of_the_ukraine_crisis/ ) . 
  sub-header :  many column inches have been devoted to analysing biased russian media reports of the ukraine crisis , but is coverage in the west as objective as it should be ? 
   according to a senior federal official could be anyone from kadyrov to zhirinovsky .

  last year it was only a few post-soviet countries , now you have a lot more such as kuwait and india , venezuela , china , etc. 
  hopefully next year there will be more western countries , it was a possibility for this year that america , germany , and italy would come - http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/698567, 
  yes but am ** redacted ** personal information . 
  there are many others in this thread that i would trust a lot more if you 're asking for more info . 
  i put the russian flag instead of the british one because i do n't want to get accused of being a shill for talking about current events from a russian perspective and only my grandmother is actually fully russian . 
  oh no , someone with a russian flair shared some typical russian opinions . 
  russia is the successor state , if we 're going to blame russia for everything the soviets did we might as well allow it to claim the legacy of it too . 
  it 's basically saying that being closer to the eu means you 'll have same sex marriage . 
  they could have made the stick people more explicitly gay in my opinion . 
  dmitri trenin is an american who is a member of the carnegie endowment . 
  it 's just a traditional stereotype ( ukrainian cossack ) , he might as well be eating salo too .

  yes , that was n't the picture posted in / r/europe before . 
  granted there is propaganda like this , http://timeua.com/upload/newscrop/2013-11-04_02-03-16.jpg , it is a bit more subtle and not so aesthetic . 
  it 's satire of real propaganda , it was posted before in / r/europe i 'm pretty sure http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/aillarionov/14234704/139899/139899_600.jpg, 
  i 'm pretty sure this is a parody . 
  there were a series of these iirc . 
  that was really interesting and obviously well-thought out , thank you for that . 
  i get your point with the uk , i 'm already subscribed to / r/ukpolitics , i see most of what 's posted there over here in / r/europe ( minus the ones about royals ) . 
  i agree that russia is in a different circumstance with the uk on reddit , but most of the population of russia lives in the european part ( 110m , ~ 80 % ) . 
  asian russia is n't as unpopulated as denmark 's greenland but it 's still a minority . 
  shame the british and russians are n't included automatically then . 
  on the right underneath the subscribe button is an option to edit flair , you can click which flag you want there and change what text comes up when someone hovers over the flag . 
  someone further up said russia and the uk were n't . 
  i guess that means more of an echo chamber here . 
  bad day for russia : * sanctions * yukos * [ potentially violated missile treaty ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/world/europe/us-says-russia-tested-cruise-missile-in-violation-of-treaty.html ), 
  each term has the explanation after , it 's not that hard . 
  be sceptical of both , and [ critically evaluate ] ( http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/institute-academic-development/postgraduate/taught/learning-resources/critical ) : 1 . 
  process - take in the information ( i.e. 
  in what you have read , heard , seen or done ) . 
  understand - comprehend the key points , assumptions , arguments and evidence presented . 
  analyse - examine how these key components fit together and relate to each other . 
  compare - explore the similarities , differences between the ideas you are reading about . 
  synthesise - bring together different sources of information to serve an argument or idea you are constructing . 
  make logical connections between the different sources that help you shape and support your ideas . 
  evaluate - assess the worth of an idea in terms of its relevance to your needs , the evidence on which it is based and how it relates to other pertinent ideas . 
  apply - transfer the understanding you have gained from your critical evaluation and use in response to questions , assignments and projects . 
  justify - use critical thinking to develop arguments , draw conclusions , make inferences and identify implications . 
   you are derailing the thread . 
  this is not about mh17 . 
  yes i realise that , the video was an example of a supposed `` truth '' circulated by pro-rebel social media users . 
  it was completely relevant to what i was talking about . 
   people , do n't believe in this video . 
  why ? 
  to blur the shit up ? 
  make people confused and `` yeah , both are dirty , let 's not give a fuck ... '' ? 
  fuck no . 
  this one of the few times i swear on reddit , this is * not * my intention . 
   when we have constantly incoming proof yes , let 's post that instead of this speculative garbage . 
   you do n't get the point about the flags yeah i missed that when i was reading this morning . 
  got it now . 
   so , if your message is `` aww , i 'm so confused ... 
  i do n't know , people you should not know either ! '', 
  then why do you even bother to wrote posts like that ? 
  so if i do n't take a strong side i should n't be bothered writing ? 
   even you post them on 9chan i do n't know 9chan , is this an internet culture reference ? 
  i do n't get your point about the flags either . 
  yes i realise there were n't any videos like this during the boston shit , but there was speculation forced as ` truth ' . 
  the mh17 video is proof that both sides use these videos to make ** false ** claims to the truth . 
  did you not get that or is it me not understanding the points you 're trying to make ?
