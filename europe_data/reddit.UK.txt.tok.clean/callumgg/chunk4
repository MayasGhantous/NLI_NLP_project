  i think they were talking mainly about the `` damning evidence '' youtube videos that both sides are circulating , on vk & reddit etc. 
  and it was inspiring for some of us . 
  public displays of affection can be obscene for some , but some will only tolerate straight public displays of affection . 
  so does gay marriage , equal rights , anti-discrimination laws , equal status for straight/gay pda offend you or is it just public obscenity ? 
  edit : down voted by the homophobes i see !, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mi3phzcyii , 
  the confusing bit is that a lot of what ukraine and russia have are the same , which means that distinguishing between them is hard . 
  it also means that when rebels have this equipment , it does n't automatically mean they captured it or were given it . 
  the [ top comment mentions the sa-13 gopher sams , which are operated by ukraine and russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k35_strela-10#operators ) . 
  so , and i 'm not saying this video is of russian or ukrainian troops because i just do n't know . 
  but can we stop taking these youtube videos as facts here ? 
  it 's just blatant speculation , it happened with reddit and boston , let 's not make it happen here in / r/europe . 
  edit : i 'm not saying this is just one side . 
  this is a video circulated that ` proves ' it was ukraine that shot down the malaysia airlines flight - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3momxnhnua, 
  yeah , you never hear about gays being beaten up in russia on the news do you ? 
  this is an event that only happens once a year . 
  it 's important for the lgbt community . 
  it 's selectively enforced and do n't worry , it 's great that people want to learn more about russia ( even if it 's a negative aspect ) . 
  i do n't know who you 're referring to , but a lot of homophobes in russia would have no problem admitting their prejudice . 
  yes hopefully this encourages more to join such events . 
  lgbt outnumber radicalists , but need to be better organised . 
  i 'm seeing parallels with britain in the 80s , [ where a similar gay propaganda law was enacted but taken back a few decades later after campaigning by people like peter tatchell ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/section_28 ) . 
  obviously britain did n't have the legacy of a garrison state like the soviet union , so this is pretty damn optimistic . 
  the other side of the coin : [ russian journalists are far safer than mexican journalists , ordinary russians , and their own counterparts under yeltsin ] ( http://darussophile.com/2012/05/russian-journalists-are-far-safer-than-mexican-journalists-ordinary-russians-and-their-own-counterparts-under-yeltsin/ ) . 
   when a journalist is killed in mexico or brazil , it is reported placidly and matter of factly , the newspaper restricting itself to : names and identities ( four journos from veracruz ; mario randolfo marques lopes ) ; possible culprits ( `` the work of the cartels '' ; `` accusing local officials of corruption '' ) ; some basic context , e.g. 
  quantity of other journalist killings in the recent past . 
  and apart from a final sentence or two noting that `` corruption means it is often difficult to define where the authorities stop and organised crime begins '' , that is pretty much the harshest judgment they make . 
   now turn to the guardian 's coverage of the sole russian journalist killed in the past three years - khadzhimurad kamalov , in dagestan , 2011 . 
  the difference begins with the titles . 
  what used to be `` four mexican journalists murdered in last week '' or brazilian journalist and girlfriend kidnapped and murdered '' now becomes `` truth is being murdered in putin 's bloody russia . '' and it continues in the same vein , with rhetoric being substituted for facts : `` crimes against freedom bathed in slothful impunity '' ; `` inside moscow , rulers who pay lip service to human rights parade only an indifference that makes them complicit in these crimes '' ( is calder\u00f3n or dilma rousseff complicit in journalist killings in their countries ? 
  ) ; `` how many more , mr putin ? 
  how long are we supposed to mourn fellow journalists who died trying to tell us , and their fellow russians , what a slack , slimy , savage state you run ? '' i do n't think the guardian is all that bad though . 
  edit : seriously ? 
  i say russia is as bad as mexico or brazil and i get hidden from the discussion ? 
  where are all these ` pro-putin bots ' that / r/europe is always on about now ? 
  yeah you just keep on the old guard . 
  there were plenty more ` important ' things for the public at that time than the murder of a few journalists, 
  it 's most likely that junior members of security services murdered them , the legacy of the soviet system meant that this need n't have been a top-down decision . 
  in my opinion , sanctions to russia could drive it further east away from europe . 
  this is not good for ordinary russians or europeans , maybe americans only . 
   northern england ^ ( i joke . 
  i have no idea what the roller coasters are like up there . ), 
  as a moderator of a totally non-political subreddit ( / r/notebooks ) , comments appearing deleted happens often . 
  moderators have to manually approve these comments , which are n't as visible as unapproved links . 
  linking to social media , using url shorteners , or referral links , can all contribute to this likelihood . 
  except this is exactly what these people think , and they can be wrong and you can disagree , but it 's important to know their narrative all the same . 
   but the east still has that . 
  playing the terrorist 's advocate here , the leader of their country who had his core power base in their regions and that they likely elected was overthrown by a violent coup . 
  so they got that . 
   i work with a number of russian energy companies operating in europe what job do you do , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  i 'm looking to get into the energy business . 
  this reminds me of a character in the first circle by solzhenitsyn , who is a philologist and tries to speak entirely without using loanwords but can not keep up . 
  also note that the liberal democratic party is * not * part of the liberal opposition so no need for anyone to defend them . 
  for many a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong , gives it a superficial appearance of being right , and raises at first a formidable outcry in defense of custom . 
  but the tumult soon subsides ... time makes more converts than reason . 
  the uk had a huge increase in health budget as a % of gdp iirc . 
  there are better institutions though . 
  am on mobile at hospital , or would link . 
  i was n't lying , i thought i was telling the truth . 
  not everything is part of the russia today/pravda agenda - http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27vdxr/lets_not_forget_that_80_years_ago_from_19341976/ci4qgvy the sterilisation still exists for trans people in various countries , but was removed by the danish parliament just today and sweden in july last year . 
  people just do n't dig up old stuff and share it randomly on a politicised forum , it is often part of an agenda ( conscious or not ) and the wording op made makes it sound like a point in an argument . 
  edit : skim read prior , i changed what i wrote above . 
  i originally stated that sweden was still doing this but i was wrong . 
  the flair text says i 'm from britain . 
  i have russian flair because i have russian ties and do n't want people to assume i 'm just another ` neutral ' british commenter because i 'm not . 
  yep that 's why . 
  i try ... 
  it means we can identify good and bad areas , compare policy , target areas of high tension etc part of solving a problem is investigating it . 
  yes but kazan , the culture , different ethnicities and everything existed before that name . 
  tatarstan has been a part of russia for something like 500 years , it 's likely that tatars could like being a part of russia but still have religious tensions with orthodox russians . 
  if you want to find out more , i read these two articles for different views : * [ positive ] ( http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/oleg-pavlov/friends-and-neighbours-religious-harmony-in-tatarstan ) * [ negative ] ( http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/summer2013/tatarstan-battle-islam-russias-heartland ),

  see / u/slyratchet 's comment above , poroshenko is n't sabre rattling here . 
  i know i 'm probably too late here but i was speaking from person experience with my own family in israel . 
  of course i know the majority of russian israelis are n't pro-russia , but that does n't mean that these rumours are unfounded : * https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b8%d1%8f&amp;tbm=nws * http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/3373031-v-podderzhku-dnr-prybyl-yzraylskyi-spetsnaz-alyia-zamestytel-hubareva * [ interview with israeli in east ukraine ] ( http://izvestia.ru/news/570353 ) * [ try running google translate through this for an example of a anti-maidan israeli ] ( http://www.ha-makom.co.il/post/liza-avigdor-eskin?utm_source=socialplat&amp;utm_medium=fbpage&amp;utm_campaign=liza-avigdor-eskin ), 
  it 's not entirely implausible given the amount of russians in israel , or the jews whose only memories of ukraine are from lvov in wwii . 
  there were even rumours of some israeli citizens who formed a ` battalion ' to ` fight the nazis ' . 
  i have a feeling this is going to get worse before it gets better . 
  if you do n't like having a monarchy then charles is your best bet for now . 
  i 'm trying to contrast the two views which are only a few months apart , i do n't deny that putin let the cat out of the bag for ethnic tensions and is n't really doing anything to solve them . 
  when ukraine had a pro-kremlin dictator it was deemed a mess , now overnight it 's suddenly a stable and legitimate state ? 
  i 'm not going to pretend that i 'm for what is happening in east ukraine or what happened to crimea , but * seriously * ? 
   if anyone can dance the complicated minuet required to both court europe and not provoke moscow , analysts and diplomats concur , mr. poroshenko can . 
    mr. poroshenko has proved business negotiating skills , a pragmatic streak and long experience in the fractious ukrainian government . 
  he was the foreign minister in 2009 and 2010 and the trade minister after that , telling agence france-presse last week , `` i know putin ; i have had extensive experience in discussions with him ; he is a strong and tough negotiator . ''   but what mr. putin thinks of him remains unclear . 
  on the positive side , mr. poroshenko has certain attributes that look good from red square . 
  he has ties to russia 's business elite , having invested heavily here . 
  he is known to make pilgrimages to russian orthodox monasteries . 
  his son met his daughter-in-law in st. petersburg , mr. putin 's hometown . 
    russia did not go so far as to condemn him as a nazi sympathizer , its main taint against a raft of kiev politicians . 
  he is , as one analyst not authorized to speak publicly said , seen by the kremlin as `` rukopozhaty , '' or someone with whom you are willing to shake hands . 
  it would give the interim government more legitimacy which in turn would make the coup ` legal ' , which is something they do n't agree with . 
  someone else who knows more should chime in though . 
   polls have opened in ukraine for presidential elections widely expected to deliver power to a pro-west candidate . 
  but separatists in the east are expected to disrupt the vote . 
  the vote is seen as the most important since ukraine 's independence in 1991 , and crucial to the country 's survival after months of turmoil which began when street protests forced out the kremlin-backed regime in february . 
  what is he saying ? 
  ** tl ; dw ** a finnish politician ca n't speak , but tries anyway . 
  why did n't she pick english to be interviewed in ?
