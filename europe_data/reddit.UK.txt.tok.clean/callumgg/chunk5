  the uk put through similar tax legislation that gives huge savings for international firms . 
  there 's a recap in the back of this week 's private eye iirc ( british version of the phoenix ) . 
   ** the east against west story does have one beneficiary : the kremlin ** . 
  in ukraine moscow is trying to preserve a crooked regime against the wishes of ukrainians who want to live with dignity , because the old ways made it money . 
  it also fears a united and stable ukraine would join nato . 
  that 's why russia is sheltering yanukovych , and threatening not to recognise the elections on 25 may . 
  russia is deploying its propaganda apparatus to present this as an ideological struggle rather than a mercenary one . 
  rt , the channel formerly known as russia today , addresses the outside world , while state television channels bombard russian-speakers with denunciations of the `` fascists '' in kiev . 
  it 's not letting russia off for any of this . 
   `` anyone who tells you ukraine is a battle between russia and the west is wrong . 
  it is a lazy narrative told by ignorant people , but is helping create a genuine tragedy that we should all be concerned about ... 
  it 's far easier to sell ukraine if it 's czechoslovakia 1968 , rather than a messy failed state , a european congo . '', 
  [ some context for all us one-hit wonders ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:eurovision_participation_map.svg ) . 
  before you judge me for my flair and the fact that the website says ` moscow ' in it , bear in mind that the moscow times caters to english language expats in russia without the typical pro-government stance . 
  the article itself is also written by a croatian and an american . 
  you earn tourism points by doing certain stuff like holding a concert tour with a musician you have which counts against their ` culture ' points . 
  once you get more tourism points than their culture , you slowly become more influential on them until you become dominant . 
  once you 're dominant over all other players you win a ` culture ' victory . 
   a great deal of people believe that zhirinovsky is acting too i want to believe . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_history_in_russia#russian_empire if you cherry pick you could make the claim that it was great to be gay in the russian empire , but for most people it was not like that . 
  you 're probably right , they could have had someone write in something related to what happened in odessa every three/four paragraphs . 
  that would n't have taken too long depending on what quality they wanted . 
  well of course they have troops at the borders , they have known military bases near the borders that have had regular troops for a long time now - http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2014/04/russiabases600-2.jpg, 
  not gon na happen imo , but maybe it will push america to fund nasa more . 
  i was not for any invasion or annexation . 
  crimea would have made its own choice eventually . 
  i have always supported sovereignty as the only thing that allows order . 
  in my context as a jew , and as someone who simply can not take seriously a statement about using nuclear weapons for territorial gain , yes i think svoboda are extreme . 
  he says these things to get reactions , yeltsin also threatened america with nukes but he was n't serious . 
  his party thrives on protest votes and publicity . 
  if svoboda are the same , please correct me . 
  i understand your point , but i think fascist or anti-semitic elements should be excluded or at least not invited when an interim government has the choice . 
  svoboda is [ disproportionately represented in the ukrainian cabinet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabinet_of_ukraine#cabinet ) , compare this with ** zero ** ldpr reps in the [ russian cabinet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_cabinet#current_cabinet ) . 
  svoboda is less moderate ( we 're in the realm of fascists here so ymmv ) than ldpr and has a chaotic political situation to take advantage of . 
  svoboda is part of the interim government full stop/period . 
  it has a margin of 1/2 % less support than ldpr , but it is also more extreme . 
  hehe, 
  i know . 
  i never said anything about genocide ? 
  who are you arguing with ? 
  and yes i know what an interim government is . 
  ironically it 's saying the exact things that the subscribers were in the comments of the article it 's rebuking . 
  i know that more reputable sources have no interest in correcting stories like this but i wish they would all the same . 
  `` no matter where our people live , in the east or the south , we are europeans '' - putin . 
  russia needs to be a part of europe , it does n't have to be * with * europe but it 's also part of its identity and history etc. 
  the european finality debate and its national dimensions . 
  it 's saying the same as everyone else did in reddit , i 'm linking to a specific article , not the whole website . 
  and of course it 's going to be a russian interest paying for the hosting etc. , ( because why would anyone else bother with a boring story like this ? ), 
  but that does n't negate what it says . 
  it 's hyperbole , but svoboda holds minority positions in the new government . 
  [ there 's a reason why the israelis are not fond of the new government ] ( http://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/cathy-young/fascism-anti-semitism-and-ukraine-cathy-young-1.7850839 ) . 
  the new government should never have let svoboda in , and the people should vote them out in the elections . 
  this may get down-voted on account of the title and my flair , but it * is * genuine . 
  it was called out in the comments of the actual article , but that wo n't reverse the spread that it created just from being on the front page . 
  from / r/ukrainianconflict -  ok , so forbes says that the report `` was quickly taken down as if it were toxic radioactive waste . '', 
  but the kyiv post is reporting the story also , [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/enrique-ravello-even-russian-human-rights-body-finds-crimean-referendum-falsified-346279.html?flavour=mobile )   * that * story links to another site , [ here . 
  ] ( http://khpg.org/index.php?id=1399238176 ) and that site links to the report , suggesting it 's still up on an official russian site . 
  the linked report is [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.president-sovet.ru/structure/gruppa_po_migratsionnoy_politike/materialy/problemy_zhiteley_kryma.php ) is `` president-soviet . ru '' an official russian government website ? 
  it sounds like complete bullshit to me , frankly . 
    * but even still * , on that website is the report , which if translated says that there was a turnout of 30-50 % with a vote in favor of joining russia of 50-60 % . 
  so , assuming that report and website are even true , which i personally am doubting very much , then forbes went above and beyond to misrepresent even * that * information by claiming `` the turnout was a maximum 30 % '' and `` of these , only half voted for annexation . '', 
    i know kyiv post is pumping out bullshit 24/7 in this conflict , but i expected better of forbes honestly , and am embarrassed for them in this case . 
  alternately . .  in the field of international relations , a sphere of influence ( soi ) is a spatial region or concept division over which a state or organization has a level of cultural , economic , military , or political exclusivity , accommodating to the interests of powers outside the sphere of the state that controls it . 
   the term is also used to describe non-political situations , e.g. , a shopping mall is said to have a sphere of influence which designates the geographical area where it dominates the retail trade . 
  the term people use with regards to russia is its ` near abroad ' . 
  the wikipedia page is a bit sparse , but [ this essay gives a decent overview ] ( http://www.e-ir.info/2013/06/17/assessing-russias-policy-toward-its-near-abroad/ ) . 
  thank you for finding a convenient way to dismiss whatever i say off-hand . 
  look at my account history across reddit for the last 2 and a half years and you 'll see that i am not a shill . 
  this wo n't stop you from accusing others you do n't agree with of being that though . 
  clearly ? 
  they say that whiskey sucks , and report on gay whales or aborted irish foetuses ? 
  that 's probably the worst bit of the map to take an example from , given the state of abortion in ireland and the high rate ( and the history ) of abortion in russia . 
  ahh ok it was still hidden for me . 
  i do n't think anyone who knows anything about russia would dispute that . 
  you can only see your own comment score when scores are hidden like on this subreddit . 
  the comment that is being upvoted by ` putinbots ' ( ??! ), 
  is below threshold and is automatically collapsed . 
  dugin is advisor to the speaker of the house , he has influence but that is moderated . 
  it would be interesting to draw parallels between his work and recent events , but his presence does n't make the government fascist any more than a liberal * civiliki * would make russia a western style democracy . 
  sounds like they 're just trying to stir up shit and annoy people . 
  downvote and move on . 
  the original title is more catchy , but mine is closer to the one they use on social media , and gives a better idea of what people are clicking on . 
  also not all of these follow the government line . 
  it did n't look like the psni at all so must have been the gardai you 're probably right . 
  i took a bus from gvs in belfast down to dublin and we stopped somewhere around the border and a guy came on to check passports . 
  there was no visa/anything like that , but there is at least some infrastructure for this sort of thing at the border , even if it 's one in every 20 vehicles or something . 
  it 's an important distinction with the eu that it 's less like losing sovereignty but * pooling * sovereignty . 
  not saying that the eu is n't undemocratic or whatever , just the way it looks structurally from a statist ir perspective . 
  last time i went i had my passport checked . 
  ok sorry about that , i 'll edit my original comment now . 
  it was sidetracking from what you were saying as well . 
  and yes the report was from 2013 . 
  yes because obviously the term means something different to laymen and think tanks/institutions . 
  you do n't get it if you did n't read the fund for peace report or anything else i said . 
  i thought you downvoted me as soon as i posted that comment but i was wrong and made an assumption all the same :(, 
  * it no longer has control over its territory . 
  * it no longer has a monopoly over the use of force .
