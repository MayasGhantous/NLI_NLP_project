  as well as the more obvious characteristics :  the 12 indicators cover a wide range of state failure risk elements such as extensive corruption and criminal behavior , inability to collect taxes or otherwise draw on citizen support , large-scale involuntary dislocation of the population , sharp economic decline , group-based inequality , institutionalized persecution or discrimination , severe demographic pressures , brain drain , and environmental decay . 
  states can fail at varying rates through explosion , implosion , erosion , or invasion over different time periods . 
  it 's not just russian efforts to make it * appear * so , but the fact that ukraine lost a portion of territory that it claimed sovereignty over to russia . 
  for the record , the source i used is american and not russian . 
  out of the frying pan ... 
  also , russia is a middle-income country . 
  the problems it has should be compared to other middle-income countries like armenia/pakistan/mexico / hungary , all this geopolitical grandstanding does not change this . 
  [ putin , at the start of his presidency , was actually in favour of this if russia 's interests were not exploited ] ( http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=20000306&amp;id=o1hiaaaaibaj&amp;sjid=ah8eaaaaibaj&amp;pg=5738,2522991 ) . 
  this started to look like much more likely ~ 2003 when russia was a strong ally with america and helped a lot in the war on terror . 
  circa the invasion of iraq this started to change and the missile shields in europe , nato relations with georgia , regime change in libya , all conspired to make a russia in nato much less likely . 
  it 's also worth mentioning that putin was probably one of the key leaders in the current kremlin ` clan ' who was most in favour of close relations with the us before it began to fall apart . 
  the national security council , too , was against it . 
  israel is n't 100 % jewish . 
  quite a few of those with high unemployment are ` outside ' of europe like r\u00e9union , ceuta , and melilla etc. 
  any reasons why ? 
  it has been , but these kind of things pop up on / r/europe all the time from lots of different european countries so i did n't think it was inappropriate . 
  it was better received in / r/ukpolitics and / r/unitedkingdom though and it was good of you to suggest that . 
  there are some neo-liberals who believe in balance of power theory , i see your point though . 
  i do n't really have an opinion on it to be honest . 
  i 'm still waiting to be convinced by someone else on the subject . 
  also people should n't downvote you for asking a question so i upvoted you sorry if this is n't reddiquwtte but i 'm a bit tipsy and it 's late here, 
  i do n't think it 's ok but at the same time it does n't phase me and it 's more likely some lone crazies than the kind of people you usually see on / r/europe . 
  so this should n't be seen as representative of / r/europe * at all * , but only a reason as to why people might have accounts that only comment on specific issues . 
  good point , if people ca n't differentiate offhand the different outlets , why should they treat them differently . 
  i understand this position better now thank you, 
  and that 's not international law . 
  i agree with you , but it 's irrelevant to my comment ? 
  it 's not propaganda , that 's too harsh a word . 
  the article does n't reflect such an indictment in my opinion . 
  up to the mods if they remove it for editorialising though . 
  original title was too controversial , article would never have been read . 
  the author makes the argument that it is in the interests of both nato and russia to maintain the appearance of russian troops stationed near the ukrainian border . 
   moscow is unlikely to boast of any scaling back of its military presence near eastern ukraine , lest it appear either to be bowing to western pressure or to be leaving those same east ukrainian `` compatriots '' in the lurch . 
  it helps that people call out on this though , and it 's not everyone in this subreddit . 
  news outlets that look russian ( even liberal/oppositionist ones ) are also down voted instantly . 
  if i see an interesting article on the [ moscow times ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_moscow_times ) , which is an english-language newspaper that is generally sympathetic to the west , i would n't bother posting it . 
  [ it is mentioned in the news outlets ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/news_sources#wiki_russia ) part of the wiki in this subreddit though . 
   if a government opposes the us , surely it must be the good guys in ir we call this a balance of power . 
  it 's only good because it stops hegemony , and the unilateral actions that follow with it ( e.g. 
  invasion of iraq etc. 
   nope . 
  i 'm really john kerry this explains a lot hmunkey ... 
   can you imagine someone on / r/europe condemning ukraine for doing this ? 
  i 'm a regular here , and i would . 
  there are plenty of others too who would . 
  whoever does not miss the soviet union has no heart , but whoever wants it back has no * brain * . 
  they 've been disbanded but there 's no reason to believe that they did n't counter-protest to try and silence demos . 
  there were about 120,000 countrywide , so it would have been hard to get 100,000 in moscow but not totally impossible . 
  from personal experience , down votes from making ` pro-russia ' comments follow me around reddit . 
  i noticed this when seeing posts of mine i had n't approved from my own subreddits ( where there is a strict filter ) being down voted right away . 
  this is n't a big deal , but i can see how some would create accounts for controversial topics . 
  well up until recently russia had a good record for international law , these people probably would n't care what 's going on inside the country . 
  most russians would n't care , especially when it comes to insulting gay people . 
  if i were * trying * to be oversensitive to every phrase with a different meaning i could have said he was racist about the knuckle dragging , which would have been disingenuous . 
  in britain ( having spent most of my life in london ) , a bum friend/chum/buddy / bumder is pretty clearly derogatory . 
  that 's why i asked where / u/piliger was from . 
  `` ha ha ha , this person has sex up the bum ! '', 
  i took no issue with you insulting putin , when you used a homophobic slur i took issue . 
  just because i have russian flair does n't mean * i * am homophobic/ultra-orthodox . 
  http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bum%20friend http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bum%20chums http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bum%20buddies http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bum%20pals i do n't know if english is your first language ( i 'm sorry if this is just a language barrier ) , but that sounds like a ( edit : ** homophobic ** ) slur to me . 
   got downvoted to hell , exactly my point  `` no , when you 're down voted it 's because you 're wrong . 
  when we 're down voted it 's paid shills . '', 
  [ this picture just looks really fake ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cchdx88.jpg ) . 
  i do hope that they have changed their ways though , and i 'm intent on believing it because it makes me feel good , as someone whose jewish family was forced out of ukraine by bandera et al during the war . 
  this is nashi at camp seliger ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seliger_ ( forum ) ) , which is like a very politicised version of [ ` scouts ' ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/seliger_2007_%286%29.jpg ) . 
  there is also a [ liberal alternative ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antiseliger ) political camp , so it 's not unique to the incumbent party . 
   to become part of putin 's bum friends no need for homophobia . 
   the knuckle dragging class yes , anyone who votes for an authoritarian leader is stupid and drags their knuckles on the floor like a gorilla . 
  rightly or wrongly , there are more complex reasons behind this , and russians do n't have a liberal western background . 
  what i 'm saying is that when people believe that russia is no different from the ussr in terms of media freedoms , they are no longer surprised when they hear of news about internet censorship , the laws against ` extremist ' views , crackdowns on specific organisations etc. 
  they think the war has already been lost , and it has n't ( yet ) . 
  there is also * definitely * less censorship in russia than most people in this subreddit believe . 
  just linking ** one ** liberal newspaper such as * novaya gazeta * often shocks people , which shows you ca n't really talk about genuine freedom of speech issues here . 
   bbc imposes many editorial guidelines informally , it also gives too much coverage to the monarchy . 
  i hate to link to old comments , but this was one i wrote around 8 months ago : big stories that are negative about the royals are often not covered , recently :  * duchy of cornwall accused of tax avoidance covered by : the guardian , the independent , the daily mail , financial times , the daily express bbc coverage : ** none **  * royal finances to be investigated by public accounts committee covered by : the independent , the daily mail , the telegraph , the sunday express bbc coverage : ** none **  * prince charles uses intestate cash to fund own lobby groups and old public school covered by : the guardian , the times , the daily mail , the daily express bbc coverage : ** none **  however , they did cover these stories recently too :  * prince charles visits community shop * charles and camilla take tube ride * prince charles : ` i 'm feeling very old ' * royal baby prompts green concern for prince charles * prince charles calls for more compassion in nhs * prince charles revives horse logging on balmoral estate * prince charles urges ` harmony with nature ' * prince charles ` worried ' for rural communities * prince charles visits northampton shoe factory * prince charles visits middleport pottery factory, 
  whilst i do n't agree with all his conclusions , he raises a lot of important points . 
  also , it 's debatable whether or not the situation will get better , as it may get worse * and * mimic internet censorship laws of other countries . 
  this is probably in light of moody 's downgrading ukraine to [ `` default imminent with little prospect for recovery . 
  '' ] ( http://www.dw.de/moodys-downgrades-ukraine-credit-rating-again/a-17545328 ), 
  well in your last comment you said `` i did n't say he was insane '' there 's no problem with having an axe to grind if you 're open about it !, 
  about a month or so ago , there was a migration from a sizeable russian forum in the same manner as digg . 
  they made their own subreddit but it 's not unreasonable to think that they went to others too . 
  yes where is my share of the jew gold ? 
  / s in a previous thread there were redditors surprised that the * educated middle class * in russia could support the government 's stance on ukraine . 
  it 's like they could n't even comprehend the other side 's perspective beyond `` they 're so stupid '' and `` sudetenland '' . 
   he 's probably getting social media updates iirc , he does n't use the internet even for research . 
  putin is n't young , and russia has a much smaller internet penetration than the west . 
  for months / r/europe had been complaining about a lack of russian views , and since a lot of them have come to reddit ( mainly following crackdown on other russian forums ) , they 're suddenly paid propagandists trying to undermine the west from within ? 
  they 're planning to merge it with another state broadcaster . 
  in the meantime they 're shuffling about staff of the agency . 
  the law was passed yesterday iirc , so bbc nyt etc may not have picked up on it yet . 
  i changed the title because the original one did n't really say anything . 
  this quote , which is part of the article , has also been used as a title on other social media . 
  * ria novosti is being closed down by putin for being too independent . 
  * the law happened yesterday and it was n't deemed important enough by english language outlets yet . 
  is this fair given the recent context , or is it wrong out of principle ? 
  what do other people think ? 
  this is a fervently oppositionist newspaper - http://www.novayagazeta.ru - it is independent from government and owned by an oligarch in london . 
  it is not , however , on national television . 
  people can look it up on the internet or pay for a subscription to it and read the paper but they have to make an effort to do so .
