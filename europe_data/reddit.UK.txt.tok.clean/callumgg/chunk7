  russia does have real independent press , * just not in prime time * . 
  that would be svoboda , fascist and ultra-nationalist but [ not necessarily the same ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svoboda_ ( political_party ) ) . 
  as a jew , i would not like to be near any of them in a dark alleyway . 
  that 's actually fairly sizeable , if an insurgency mobilised even half of them the situation would become unmanageable . 
  i do n't think banning journalists should even be an option , no matter how sour relations get . 
  there are other liberal ways to stop ` propaganda ' ( e.g. 
  ofcom taking away presstv 's licence ) . 
  xpost / r/foreignpolicyanalysis  once the cold war ended , western militaries reduced their focus on military deterrence in europe . 
  as a consequence , the ukraine crisis has caught nato flat-footed as it rushes to find an adequate response to russia . 
  germany has been reluctant to go along . 
  what i 'm saying is that they should n't make it look like itar-tass is not a mouthpiece . 
  it 's misleading . 
  well it ca n't project power globally or one thing ( at least on the same scale as america ) . 
  if you do n't agree with the article , you do n't have to editorialise the title of it , just add your own opinion separate to it . 
  i 'd like to know if it 's just one over zealous mod or the whole team . 
  good thing you can create unlimited accounts on reddit , 
  what happened to your old account ? 
  source ? 
  edit : 1 minute in and an insta-downvote before a source . 
  in france you get mcbaguettes and fast food shops that specialise in pasta . 
  in britain you have gregg 's and a very particular breed of greasy spoon . 
  british people as a whole often eat whilst walking or doing something else , but my impression of the french is that they take their time . 
  now i do n't know about mcdonald 's in the us , but the differences you 've mentioned do n't make the country sound more culturally diverse . 
  yet this is culture more on an individual or community level , british national culture does n't automatically include all of the culture from immigrants unless something like this is adopted at large like tikka masala . 
  in op 's linked post , they talk about federal law . 
  true that there is some growing homogeneity within the eu , but there is still a much bigger and historic difference between napoleonic law , british law , russian law , etc. 
  i do n't mean to attack what you say , just remind you that we have a history of being in separate states with separate national goals , myths , etc. 
  that have not had a chance to converge yet . 
  [ only twenty odd years ago , half of europe was a garrison state with the ( real , not just poetic ) iron curtain for instance ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7cwajaox4e ) . 
  from the asia wiki page :  the most commonly accepted boundaries place asia to the east of the suez canal , the ural river , and the ural mountains , and south of the caucasus mountains ( or the kuma -- manych depression ) and the caspian and black seas . 
  from the europe wiki page :  europe is generally divided from asia by the watershed divides of the ural and caucasus mountains , the ural river , the caspian and black seas , and the waterways connecting the black and aegean seas . 
  of course you could make the argument that europe is bordered through peripheries , and that russia is more asian than central europe . 
  i would n't agree with you on that , but to sum up i definitely meant the title to refer to europe ( for one thing , the mercury tower probably would n't be asia 's tallest building ) . 
  i 'm not sure how far down in either nyc or london . 
  right now i 'm living in belfast and a lot of it is built upon marsh too , do you have problems with damp and mould in chicago ? 
  moscow 's international business centre . 
  hopefully there 'll be a new one with the frostbite engine out soon . 
  as long as they do n't make the mercury tower come down like in siege of shanghai i 'll be happy , 
  london is also mostly clay , so i gather it must have been difficult i build the shard . 
  nyc is fortunately built upon granite i think . 
  the mast sounds like a structure rather than a building , is it ? 
  there are plenty of radio/tv towers in europe that are between 3-400 + metres iirc . 
  it 's part of the moscow ibc .

  well on a serious note if russia were ever to join the eu , having a flag with the double-headed eagle would go some way to appease nationalists , although red is a * bad * idea . 
  also worth noting that the eagle is a very european emblem as well ( used by romans , byzantines , austrians , albanians , hungarians , serbians etc and could represent an open multi-vector foreign policy approach ( facing east & west at the same time ) . 
  and taiwan , according to other comments in this thread . 
  i saw the data on the oecd iirc . 
  i think you 're overestimating putin 's reach . 
  except putin cut poverty by half . 
  true that this was on the back of oil nationalisation and coupled with rising inequality , but the way you said it implied that russia had n't cut poverty . 
  from what i 've understood it has always been a very profitable corporation , do you have a source for it being unprofitable at some point ? 
  prince charles is facing a westminster campaign to strip him and his estate of special privileges including tax exemptions , a power of veto over new laws and immunity from legislation covering everything from squatting to planning . 
  exactly , 
  possible that the source is outdated or just a data set of ignorant stereotypes . 
  is there any proof that she stole the money ? 
  i 'm not trying to side anywhere here , just curious to learn more . 
  i chose the subtitle as the title because i felt it told more about the actual story to people not already familiar with uk politics , the original title was '' * mps question royal family 's ` undue influence ' on legislation * '' . 
  the article talks about the commons political and constitutional reform committee , and its thoughts on the royal veto . 
  other discussions in [ r/ukpolitics ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/21e38c/mps_question_royal_familys_undue_influence_on/ ) and [ r/britishrepublicans ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/britishrepublicans/comments/21hpuh/mps_question_royal_familys_undue_influence_on/ ),

  +84 is serious stuff . 
  i do n't know a lot either , but am learning  it was also interesting that you asked why i decided to share it , because it helped me to understand why it was relevant for me etc. 
  so thanks for that . 
  i do n't think i 've been trying to outweigh the news in crimea with ` good ' news about space , though i ca n't speak personally for state/private media in russia . 
  i kept in the bit about it being in the early morning because in my opinion it brings it closer to us . 
  `` russian astronauts go to iss '' would be bland and concise , but adding some descriptive elements to it could make the story more relatable . 
  i posted it because i thought it was cool and i saw it first on my facebook feed , and also stuff like this does n't happen all the time ( subjective ) . 
  someone else posted this right now ( http://howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/ ) which puts it in perspective . 
  i said negative things in other threads . 
  i voiced my opinion about how i opposed the state 's intervention in crimea , the lack of freedom of speech , and the lack of a more liberalised market economy among other issues like corruption . 
  ( edit : i also implied further down that russia weaseled out of bilateral treaties and was being disingenuous ) i think what 's going on with the iss is cool though so i posted that without making a negative statement about russian politics . 
  my point was that / r/europe does n't always need to be about politics , this is about the iss and you just look like you have an axe to grind . 
  am i a hypocrite for using sarcasm ? 
  yes , but international law has plenty of space to weasel around in , especially if you 're prepared to be disingenuous . 
  rtop , precedence from unsc resolutions , challenging the ` legitimacy ' of the new ukrainian government , self-determination etc. 
  space treaty is pretty much set though . 
  plus it 's not in anyone 's interests to take over the iss by themselves , and it would effectively be a declaration of war against nato . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/outer_space_treaty there wo n't be a civil war or coup in space that any country could use for an opportune strike . 
  thank you for the political analysis . 
  i 'm sure once you get out there , into some huge depth of space and nothingness , political boundaries seem pretty small . 
  the original title was '' * new space station crew readies for launch on russian rocket * '' , but this is literally the first line of the article and is more revealing . 
  have you got any evidence that this is happening or are you just playing to the biases of / r/europe alongside your own prejudices ? 
  saying that i have * zero * knowledge because i make the distinction between a weak opposition ( that is divided and does n't control major media ) and a potemkin opposition . 
  if there are any puppet opposition that putin controls , it 's rodina or a just russia , not a genuine threat like the communist party , that by most accounts , won fair against a rigged election in the 90s . 
  zyuganov has been around a lot longer than putin , and believe it or not but the communist party is still big in post-soviet countries . 
  i 'm sure zyuganov is * all part of putin 's plan * to reinstate zombie stalin and the ussr . 
  off tangent , but at the white house daily press briefing on friday the correspondents kept on trying to get the spokesperson to say the word ` drone ' and she would only use the term ` remote-piloted aircraft ' . 
  one of them actually said ` can you -- are you able , physically , to use the word `` drone '' ? ', 
  to be fair , this specific law was on the initiative of the leader of the opposition . 
  i do n't think it was done right either .
