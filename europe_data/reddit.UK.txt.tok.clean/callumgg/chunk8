  in nearly whatever way you look at it , russia invaded a sovereign state and broke an international norm that it 's diplomatic corps had been trying to build for the last 10 years . 
  it still works as a protest vote . 
  it 's still disingenuous to say that there was only one choice . 
  the legitimacy of crimea moving to russia would be much more in doubt if people had voted for the old constitution . 
  there 's an option to show high resolution , i had the same problem before i discovered that . 
  that 's to prevent ballot stuffing , which is a legit . 
  problem in post-soviet states . 
  there was an option for crimea to join russia , or for it to be a state in voluntary association with ukraine under the '92 constitution . 
  it was a complete false dichotomy , but nothing as blatant as no `` no '' option . 
  i did n't say it did n't have issues ( huge ones ! ), 
  with freedom of the press , hell i linked to the wikipedia article . 
  there is some free media , and not ** every ** paper with oppositionist views has been shut down . 
  is turkey the soviet union because it banned twitter ? 
  here are a few other reasons why the new russia is not the same as the old soviet union : * russian and soviet are not interchangeable , russians made up around 50 % of the soviet union . 
  * the soviet union was a one-party state . 
  you can argue to hell about russia being democratic or not , but you ca n't deny that opposition parties are allowed to exist . 
  *  russia 's current economic system is highly imperfect , and suffers from weak legal institutions , corruption , an underdeveloped financial sector , and a host of other flaws . 
  but what russia does not suffer from is what the soviet union suffered from : massive economic distortion through state subsidies and outright fiat . 
   the soviet union 's policy to contain inflation was not to raise interest rates or limit bank lending but to make inflation illegal . 
  inflation was banned and prices on a host of important goods were frozen ( consumers , of course , paid the increased cost through ever-more-pervasive shortages ) . 
  the soviet treatment of unemployment was similar . 
  the soviet union sought to lower unemployment not through tax credits or through loose monetary policy but by making unemployment a crime and forcing enterprises to boost their payrolls . 
  * the iron curtain was very real , russians now have freedom of movement . 
  * the soviet union was a wartime state , and spent something like a third of its gdp on military , cf. 
  russian military spending today which is around 4 % . 
  i almost feel like we 're arguing different things . 
  i say there 's little freedom of the press but the situation is n't as bad as before and you link articles that do n't reject that . 
  it has a new editor that is pro-government , that does n't mean it does n't have editorial independence ( which is what the ` about ' section of ria novosti says ) . 
   just like everything else was either usurped by the kremlin or shut down . 
  there 's no free media in russia . 
  [ this is an exaggeration ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_the_press_in_russia#the_press ) , russia has problems with freedom of the press but it is n't the soviet union or china . 
  there are a lot of views represented in russian media . 
  the best way i have of describing it is that russia * does * have freedom of the press , just not in primetime/before the watershed . 
  was this the one they gave the ultimatum to ? 
  were there any casualties ( on either side ? ), 
  [ this article has more info ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-crisis-shots-fired-as-crimean-base-is-stormed-by-russian-troops-9209819.html ) , with a heavy dose of the human factor !, 
  it was the first one that showed a comparison that i could get to on my mobile . 
  the source you 're sharing says that ria novosti is being closed down because it is too free from bias ( edit : in case that down vote was because people thought i was making it up :  '' * in contrast to state-owned federal television channels , which are tightly controlled by the kremlin and have a reputation for screening hatchet jobs on opposition figures , ria novosti appeared to have a licence to operate relatively freely under ms mironyuk 's leadership , reporting controversial stories including the 2012 anti-putin protests in moscow , and more recently the pro-europe protests in ukraine , with little if any bias . * '' ) . 
  everyone knows ria novosti is a state agency anyway , it 's been around for ages . 
  purely on the laws of language i meant . 
  also , i do n't think russians today should be held responsible for what stalin did . 
  everyone suffered under communism . 
  nobody 's asking the protestants in northern ireland to stop talking ulster scots , and the government actually accommodates them . 
  and i think it was wrong to disenfranchise russians in estonia . 
  not a huge abuse of rights like for homosexuals in russia or the kurds in turkey but still wrong . 
  the majority of mineral and energy wealth is in the high north or other isolated areas , and the infrastructure needs as much development as the institutions . 
  i completely agree about corruption , and not making russia more attractive to foreign investors ( there 's a longstanding fear of foreigners ` pillaging ' russia 's resources though ) . 
  i also think that the ( over ? ), 
  educated workforce 's potential is completely squandered . 
  it could be similar in some way to turkey 's laws about the kurdish language . 
  not nearly on the same scale though . 
  you 're right , this was the first one on google . 
  i assume it 's something similar for chechen as well just this article was mainly about bashkirs . 
   `` university exams are now offered in bashkir , tatar , or russian '' http://www.csmonitor.com/1994/0106/06091.html/ ( page ) / 2, 
  so were other post-soviet states , [ yet there were some clear ` winners ' and losers ] ( http://imgur.com/a/da2wd ) in that regard . 
  [ i would n't say putin 's current management of the economy is anything too drastically different from the rest of e. europe anyway ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/markadomanis/files/2014/03/gdp-growth-ee-2013.png ) . 
  again , not saying that what you 're saying is wrong , but that putin had some good economic policies and some bad ones that , on the whole , would be on par to similar ( post ? ), 
  transition economies . 
  i would n't say that 's because of eu federalism but a cold war mindset , the same mindset that turned putin down from integrating with nato because they still saw russia as the ussr/the `` other '' . 
  dugin was close to primakov , and had influence there . 
  however , using him as the first link to talk about putin is disingenuous . 
  if you want to look up putin 's influences , you should look at the [ siloviki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/putin%27s_inner_sanctum#siloviki ) . 
  again , dugin ( the person you linked to ) , has criticised putin for being too liberal . 
  some actions may be approved by him , others wo n't have , this does n't meant that dugin is the ideology behind the new russia . 
  well , apparently / r/europe has made up its mind . 
  putin is literally stalin , gulags , genocide , communism , and all . 
  ridiculous . 
  it could also make them want to vote against the russians , because they are an occupying force . 
  i do n't know , i ca n't put myself in these older folk 's shoes . 
  sarah palin also predicted the invasion of ukraine , if obama were elected . 
  some german politicians such as schroeder and kohl blamed the eu 's interventions in part for what happened . 
  what made it not fair was 1 ) the phrasing of the referendum questions , 2 ) the fact that many of the people who would 've voted against the current result boycotted the referendum . 
  the americans oversaw elections with occupied troops in the middle east , it 's not unheard of . 
  pandering would be doing something about the institution of the monarchy . 
  letting them serve in the armed forces is n't pandering . 
  we 're talking about an oath here though , not the existence of a monarch . 
  and i 'm saying it would need to be adapted if we had conscription . 
  which is perfectly ok in a democracy ? 
  i do n't see your point, 
  the nation state existing and the people needing security is the unchanged part of the social contract . 
  the monarchy has changed , and it can change yet more in the future - the oath should reflect who and what everyone values most as a society . 
  the crown is a political term for the british state , it 's separate from the queen herself and it 's probably a term we 'd keep even if we became a republic . 
  then why not swear allegiance to the crown rather than elizabeth herself ? 
  this is arguing within the social contract though , and also completely practical to implement . 
  if we go down that road we could start talking about taxes and sovereignty . 
  this should n't be a controversial issue though , just put ` country ' in front of everything else in the oath and make allegiance to any unelected political figures optional . 
  you did n't answer my question but talked about how i was ` blathering ' , and that because it 's worse off in other areas i should shut up and take my lot ? 
  i 'm no freedom fighter , it 's pointless for an oath to be firstly about protecting a political office over protecting the country . 
  if we have conscription , what happens to the people who refuse to take the oath ? 
  there 's no hassle in changing the oath , and i really do n't think it 's freedom fighter bullshit ( ?! ) . 
  monarchism/republicanism are political stances , we should n't make life more difficult to people who disagree with the status quo . 
  edit : i also said * potentially * making a political viewpoint illegal . 
  you cutting me off is kind of ironic . 
  [ ipsos-mori says it hovers around one in five ] ( http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/122/monarchyroyal-family-trends-monarchy-v-republic-19932012.aspx?view=wide ) , and even if it were one in a hundred that would n't change the fact that you 're potentially making a political view illegal . 
  [ here 's tony benn 's take on the parliamentary oath ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=7ob9n8t65kw#t=42 ) for example . 
  i 'm for conscription as long as it 's done in a fair way e.g. 
  like in finland/israel . 
  you 'd also have to get rid of the oath to the queen for british republicans , or expand conscription to the navy . 
  i know that there 's a democratic deficit , same as i know there 's election fraud ( like ballot stuffing ) . 
  i just do n't think that crimea should be written off with russia before it 's given its own chance .
