  there are regional patterns of corruption and electioneering across a country as large and varied as russia . 
  also , i do consider myself a westerner . 
  born in london and living in ireland right now ( check the hover text on my flair ) . 
  i put the flag there so people know i 'm not just an average brit free from bias , if you understand what i mean ? 
  i speak a lot about russia on / r/europe so i feel like it 's more upfront . 
  oops , just recognised the typo . 
  this goes against what was decided in the referendum by the way , which was held by the crimean government . 
  thankyou , finally  edit : a shame on p15 they did n't have more options , reading through the rest now . 
  [ the census is 12 years out of date ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_census_ ( 2016 ) ) , but i appreciate you doing the maths anyway . 
  it adds to the discussion in a way that i 'd find hard to do ( being terrible at maths ) . 
  i did n't dis all the mainstream media though , i searched for keywords like `` crimea referendum rigged '' `` crimea false referendum '' and could n't find anything from after the referendum had been held . 
  [ there were allegations that russia would bus in voters from russia with ukrainian passports ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/amid-vote-preparations-in-ukraines-crimea-allegations-of-poll-rigging-intimidation/2014/03/15/1d8b4c54-ac7f-11e3-b8ca-197ef3568958_story.html ) , but there should be evidence of this ( we will know for certain within the next 24 hours or so ) . 
  all i 'm trying to do is to stop people from saying it 's rigged just because it 's a post-soviet country . 
  i think the political administrators in chechnya are slightly different from those in crimea or anywhere else in russia for that matter . 
  yes because the people in crimea are exactly the same as the people in the russian caucasus . 
  * in soviet russia , referendum votes you * , ha ha ha . 
  russian backward communist , nothing ever changes , all of them the same . 
  ukrainians and crimeans and tatars too . 
  first link is a comment piece about russia three years ago , second link is about a misprint on a regional news programme . 
  we * know * there was at least some election fraud in the russian presidential election , and for the record the second article just makes someone who knew the context skeptical . 
  are you trying to say that they would rig a referendum that everyone knows they 'd win anyway ? 
  you come across as completely out of touch . 
  all i 'm asking for is a source , and everyone 's swearing and telling me i 'm delusional . 
  this is tabloid-level politics * at best * , it 's stuff like this that i prefer subreddits like / r/europeans, 
  no , they 're there to guarantee a referendum that is illegal under ukrainian and international law . 
   holding a rigged election can you provide a source from one of the observers or a news outlet or something ? 
  ** edit : here 's what al-jazeera had to say about the fairness of the referendum : **  as a result , the referendum was conducted without major problems ; 83 percent of the population cast their vote and 96.7 percent of them - russians , ukrainians and even some tatars - voted for secession from ukraine and annexation to russia . 
  the vote was observed by 135 representatives of 23 countries and 240 observers represented the crimean civic society and political parties . 
   they unanimously confirmed that there were no significant violations and that everyone could vote freely , without any pressure . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/03/crimea-whose-land-this-part-1-201431982818368453.html ), 
  edit : ** why would they rig a referendum everyone knows they 'd win ? 
  ** ( more detail below ) think about this logically , the election does n't need to be clean to be influenced : 1 . 
  the vote presented a false dichotomy between joining russia or restoring the '92 ukraine constitution ( which was n't great for crimea btw ) . 
  a majority of people in crimea are ethnic russians . 
  a good deal of people in crimea are family of russian soldiers stationed in crimea . 
  the crimean tatars , which account for around 12 % of the population and were most pro-ukrainian/anti-russian , boycotted the referendum . 
  ukraine is up shit creek right now , so opportune timing for a secessionist referendum . 
  all the major newspapers and outlets would be running a falsified referendum as the main story , can you find one that does instead of just down voting me ? 
  2nd edit : ** here 's what al-jazeera had to say about the fairness of the referendum : **  as a result , the referendum was conducted without major problems ; 83 percent of the population cast their vote and 96.7 percent of them - russians , ukrainians and even some tatars - voted for secession from ukraine and annexation to russia .

  a slightly higher result than the exit polls suggested , but :  many crimeans who disagreed with the referendum appeared to have stayed home . 
  they included thousands of crimean tatars , an ethnic minority that accounts for about 12 % of the peninsula 's population and remains skeptical of kremlin rule after facing deportation to central asia under joseph stalin . 
  the community 's leader has called the referendum unlawful . 
  whilst the referendum was clean ( i 'm sure if it were n't we would be hearing a lot more about it ) , it should be remembered that the referendum itself has not been authorised under international law . 
  this is breaking tradition with a big source of russia 's post-soviet foreign policy , and at the very least shows a disconnect in interpretation of ukraine 's current sovereignty . 
  yeah and there was a post on / r/russia about ukraine being a creation of various russian leaders so i 'll take that with a pinch of salt over bbc/forbes/spiegel, 
  can you give a source for there only being a yes option ? 
  i was n't actually for the invasion of another sovereign state so am not being sardonic here . 
  these are exit polls . 
  and russia does n't need to manipulate the results because 1 ) they ca n't top actually taking troops into crimea and 2 ) crimeans are mostly russian . 
  it 's a rag like * the sun * . 
  * no that 's not fair !, 
  you admitted further down that the european union investigated the war and yet you say that was a lie . 
  ( [ some more information if anyone 's interested ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/responsibility_for_the_russo-georgian_war#eu_independent_fact_finding_mission_report ) ) . 
  could you explain why your uncited and unofficial version of accounts is true , and why the other version is a ` russian lie ' ? 
  ^ ( * for the record i was not in favour of any intervention in ukraine , but i do n't think it 's comparable to the war in georgia ), 
  they 're blaming sanctions , which have given the government a free pass to say it 's america 's fault . 
  yet the decline was evident to everyone in early march so what they 're saying is disingenuous . 
  `` westerns sanctions are harming russia 's economy , as a result growth will likely be less than 1 % this year , rather than the 2.5 % late 2013 prediction '' - kudrin source : http://russialist.org/kudrin-on-sanctions-western-banks-already-closing-credit-lines-to-russian-corporate-sector/, 
  same in the uk , except the police blocked part of the route of the first organised protest i went to , kettled the participants , and left a police van in the middle of the road for some daft reason . 
  the point there was that she wears a skirt , which implies that she 's more of a politician than someone with military experience . 
  the skit was made after officials announced sweden had an underfunded military , the headline at the time being that ` it would take russia less than a week to take them over ' . 
  the overall joke is at the end , where the characters come to an unexpected conclusion . 
  not putting the spoilers here though .

  it wo n't really , the people that are dirt poor will stay dirt poor and the middle class will stay in their same lifestyle . 
  except the narrative that says this is just a land-grab is missing the wider issues behind this , and ends up promoting a stand-off where one side is no longer interested in the other 's concerns and the other side feels betrayed and ignored . 
   by cutting off sales to kiev over its unpaid debts . 
  this is the bit that the title is glossing over . 
  of course when russian companies cut a service for nonpayment it 's `` mocking the west '' . 
  let 's rid ourselves of this 20th century cold war mindset reddit . 
  other countries can cheer russia too ? 
  do n't worry , i 'm westernised , speak better english than russian , drink g & ts and read the financial times . 
  oh , and i 'm completely against any sort of homophobia . 
  so anyone who makes quips about the us which are irrelevant to the discussion are suddenly anti-semitic ? 
  i 'm all for keeping down the anti-us circlejerk ( because it 's a fairly country ) but seriously ? 
  it 's tag line was ` news from a russian perspective ' . 
  the bias is why a lot of people watch it , all part of a balanced media diet . 
  especially as it 's centred on it , and because of the topic being discussed ( at the bottom of the screen ) . 
  having said that , i wo n't be surprised if a w. media outlet were to make the same mistake . 
  interesting facts , i know less about the history of outside involvement there than i 'd like . 
  funny quip indeed , 
  worth remembering there are russian military bases in armenia though . 
  '' * in his own words * , no spin [ on his own words ] '', 
  i 've had posts censored in the past and i trust most of the mods here to not do that . 
  if one of them did , it would become clear anyway . 
  when a post has ` breaking ' in a title , that 's the sort of thing the spam filter catches . 
  i only saw it because i tried to submit it myself . 
  [ the title is editorialised , but is taken from russia-direct . org 's facebook page so hopefully should be ok . ] ( https://www.facebook.com/russiadirect/posts/10152262550262472?stream_ref=1 ), 
   there is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers , it was not yanukovych , but it was somebody from the new coalition so how does the foreign minister know the snipers were not from yanukovych ? 
  this just popped up on my facebook , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26410431 i 'm sure more like it will come/maybe it 's already out there and i need to google, 
  apologies , i thought the original title was sensationalised . 
  i slept in yesterday and did n't check the news in the afternoon . 
  this morning has been one messy game of catch up and the timeline is all messed up in my head . 
  the government is in transition and the crew would be following old orders from the previous president . 
  the story is probably false however , though we 'll have to wait and see if it were some twitter troll who reported it first or a legit source .
