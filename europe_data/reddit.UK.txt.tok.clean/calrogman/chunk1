if you think that marrying someone you are in a relationship with is the same as marrying someone you are not in a relationship with , then you have probably not understood the reason why societies have any marriage legislation . 
  so out of all the life partners you 've ever had , you 've * never * formed an interpersonal relationship with any of their parents and * none * of their parents were sad to see you go when your relationship with them ended ? 
  really ? 
  the uk seems to me relatively xenophobic . 
  i 'd not be surprised if the uk 's laws relating to sham marriages are uncommonly strict . 
  i honestly see this as no different from marrying a long-term cohabitant for tax purposes ( which i 'm sure italians are all about !, 
  you 're aware that italy and the uk have different legal systems ? 
  why would it not be ?

  that 's the same thing we thought !, 
  and every time the lords quell a stupid , dangerous and shortsighted movement in the other place i find myself increasingly thankful that it exists . 
  unbridled optimism . 
  it 'd explain a lot .

  independent self regulation ai n't exactly miniluv . 
  harmless ? 
  spreading misinformation like `` scotland relies on the uk 's subsidy '' , in the run up to an independence referendum is far from fucking harmless . 
  oh , was it ? 
  i could n't tell . 
  maybe if it was actually funny , or not just regurgitating unionist misinformation , that would help . 
  scotland subsidised the uk by # 3 billion last year .

  right , yes , because we obviously are n't already in the eu . 
  sure , if you write to your msp about it and vote yes . 
  we could conceivably enshrine a right to privacy in a scottish constitution . 
  the chances of achieving the same on a uk-wide basis are slim to none . 
  [ about that ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onyx_%28interception_system%29 ),

  it says `` reducing illicit demand '' . 
  surely , if it were decriminalized or better yet legalized , the demand would be licit ( or at least , less illicit ) . 
  or is that just wishful interpretation ?

  the sami people are the indigenous hunter-gatherer people of s\u00e1pmi , which includes the north of the scandinavian peninsula and most of the kola peninsula . 
  the finns are ~ ~ foreign mongrels ~ ~ another finno-ugric peoples that developed slash-and-burn agriculture and their own language . 
  long story short , agriculture is more stable , so the finnish population exploded , they claimed lots of land , cut down lots of forests , the reindeers got upset which made the sami upset and the finns used their power in the region to marginalise the sami peoples and rob them of their culture and language without offering them political representation .
