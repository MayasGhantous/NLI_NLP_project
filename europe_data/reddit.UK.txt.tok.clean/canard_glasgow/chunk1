its not . 
  unfortunately the question boils down more to how much there is in common with the mps . 
   your point about ukip is extremely misleading . 
  there is only 6 seats in scotland so `` 16 % of meps '' really means `` one mep that got elected with 10.5 % of the vote '' . 
  and lets add that that it was an election with ~ 33 % turnout . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scotland_ ( european_parliament_constituency ) # 2014, 
  and the vote of no confidence came after labour changed the rules for the first scottish devolution referendum . 
  forty years on and the uk constitution is still a shambles . 
  any swedish perspective ? 
  the tone of that article seems too far too keen to blame the protesters given the pictures that accompany it . 
  then where does the stuff on the kettle come from ? 
  you 're drinking out the wrong tap . 
  shit ... that joke wo n't make any sense outside the uk . 
  the loyalists are more british than the queen . 
  they are the uk 's to enjoy . 
  at least it is easy to remember the lyrics .

  there are concerns about ttip http://bma.org.uk/news-views-analysis/news/2014/january/trade-disagreements-the-transatlantic-market-and-healthcare, 
   lets be honest , britain exported the parliamentary system to the world i keep noting in these discussions that the political usurpation by practiced by british colonialists is reduced to being described as a `` british export '' . 
  good newspeak . 
  you are persisting with this strawman . 
  i did not argue that the magna carta should not be taught . 
  i support teaching the magna carta in history classrooms with objectivity . 
  i argued that the magna carta should not be hijacked and used to promote `` british values '' in english schools . 
  this is a nationalistic argument ... 
  i do not think we are going to see eye-to-eye here . 
   that 's like saying french students should not study voltaire because he has not much to do with how the common man lives his life . 
  no , it is not . 
  and the rest of your post is a strawman . 
  things can and are taught in schools without being used to promote the patriotic values of patriotic citizens of `` country x '' . 
  aside , i do n't think your average conservative would be happy to see the values and virtues of lord byron taught in schools ... 
  i did not say ignore , i said keep it to the history classroom . 
   no more english , north irish , welsh or scottish history from now on when discussing british history . 
  i think you miss the point . 
   so you do n't think that structure has had large effect on british culture at all after many centuries ? 
  that the system of government , whether it be the one in westminster or glasglow , has n't shaped british identity & society in a noticeable way ? 
  that it has n't proliferated shared values ? 
  aye , there is a huge cognitive jump from  this document has shaped our political structures to  this document is key to values that people who are british should hold no one has the authority to dictate what british values are and when people in power say they want to promote `` our values '' or `` our culture '' it is a shorthand for saying they want to repress `` your values '' and `` your culture '' , whoever that you may be . 
  to clarify , i 'd argue against using ** any ** documents written centuries before the formation of the british state to promote some vague notion of british values in schools and not argue for the inclusion of ** a ** particular document . 
  keep history to history classes and aim for objectivity . 
   annoying that implication , huh ? 
  only if it goes one way . 
   if you do n't consider the separation of powers and the monarch being bound by law to be values which the british hold , than yeah , it has no place in any discussion on that regard . 
  i do n't . 
  this is a historical explanation of why the british state is structured in the way that it is , it is not an integral part of the way british citizens live their lives . 
  to my cynical mind , this whole push for the nebulous concept of british values seems to be politicians trying to get more bullshit nationalism and liberal-fetishism taught in schools . 
   the united kingdom ca n't emphasize that because it 'd alienate non-scottish kids so does that imply scottish history should n't be considered british history ? 
   especially a piece of history which went on to inspire the governing structure & ideals of the united kingdom itself ? 
  magna carta is all fine and well , interesting from a historical perspective . 
  but what the hell is it doing in a discussion of british values ( a discussion i feel very uncomfortable the uk appears to be having ) ? 
  it is 800 years old !, 
  that 's 500 years older than the british state . 
  and the whole thing would be a none issue if we had a proper constitution ... 
  what , no deceleration of arbroath ? 
  there was an amusing part of the eu election count coverage when the bbc went to their reporter for the roi who just seemed to slag off the [ single transferable vote ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_transferable_vote ) for the first minute of his report . 
  complaining that stv is too difficult to explain and counting was expected to take days . 
  it brought back memories of the bbc coverage of the av referendum . 
  our top three guesses for your english dialect : 1 . 
  north irish ( uk ) 2 . 
  ** scottish ( uk ) ** 3 . 
  irish ( republic of ) our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 . 
  ** english ** 2 . 
  swedish 3 . 
  dutch fair impressed . 
  i saw a few i thought looked very irish . 
  i do n't think car ownership is a good indicator of wealth anymore . 
  probably more can be said about population distribution , terrain and public transport . 
  i imagine the players having their content removed are more likely to fight than individuals invoking the `` right to be forgotten '' . 
   who determines what is relevant ? 
  the courts . 
   no , i do n't think it does . 
  people rejecting independence is not a vote of confidence in the status quo . 
  well ... a vote for the status quo was the defacto result of the 1979 referendum that saw devolution shelved for 15 years and the recent av referendum that seems to have killed discussion of voting reform . 
   i was under the impression they had promised higher spending and lower taxes for small businesses . 
  variations , but nothing seismic . 
   that being said , i do n't really see sense in the snp 's plans . 
  reports of the snp are awful on most of the msm . 
  in truth , the snp not all that great , moderate and boring for the most part , but they are fairly competent . 
  they are not the monsters they are portrayed as . 
  i would n't vote for them personally , but i understand why others would . 
  edit : apparently unable to form sentences, 
  the snp really has n't said much about lowering taxes or higher spending . 
  they 've talked about changing spending priorities . 
  personally i 'd like to see higher spending . 
  i would n't underestimate eu support . 
  it is not a catch all referendum . 
  eu/monarchy/currency / nato are important on their own rights . 
  there are many diverse opinions and support for or against independence does not evenly partition the population on these other issues . 
  there are yes voters against nato membership and republican no voters . 
  wisely the snp view them as separate from the debate about whether scotland should remain in the union . 
  the snp stance is that if these other issues are to change from the status quo , then that should take place through a separate procedure ( e.g. 
  political party winning elections , holding separate referendums ) . 
  the snp stance is that the scottish independence referendum is a referendum on the uk , not the eu/monarchy/currency / nato . 
  they are reducing the number of issues under consideration so that any changes with respect to eu/monarchy/currency / nato are decided at a later date . 
  going on the attack with a minority in the polls and a large number of do n't knows is a bit risky . 
  it tends to solidify opinion rather than attract hesitant undecideds . 
  if polling begins to show the yes side over 50 % , i think we 'll see a shift in tactics . 
  march is for marching . 
  round jupiter ...
