  is that meaningful in practice ? 
  from what i recall the eu does n't recognize software patents . 
   well , to be fair word2007 was a massive improvement in terms of usability . 
  the standard , no effort document still looks hideous , fonts are awful , working with large documents is a nightmare . 
  the ribbon was just a bit of hci nonsense to fix the unwieldy menus , the basic problems remained . 
   as for wymiwyg ( i.e. 
  latex ) , there has n't been any noticeable change since 92 . 
  and it would be absolutely inhuman to force average office workers deal with overfull hboxes true . 
  i have a very low opinion of all office software . 
  welcome to the world of wysiwyg word processors . 
  there has been no noticeable change since 1995 . 
   this division is not just a street-level prejudice : it is also written into the procedure at french immigration offices , where all foreigners must go to obtain their residence permits , but where the malians and congolese are taken into one room , and americans and ** swedes ** into another do eu citizens need a permit ? 
   the reasons/motives for the first world war were just like any of the other wars britain was involved in over the centuries , that of the national interest and honouring alliances , but on a much larger scale of course . 
  aye , where the national interest was the usual imperialism , colonialism and balancing of european powers . 
  the ottoman empire had been in its death throws for years and the brits and the french were waiting for the opportunity to carve up the carcass . 
   it was supposed to be ` over by christmas ' but turned out to be one of the deadliest conflicts in human history . 
  was this something the british government thought would happen beforehand ? 
  hindsight is everything . 
  throwing men ( generous term , many were merely boys ) at machine guns , engaging in chemical warfare and treating the soldiers like pieces of shit when they returned . 
  was the scale known before hand ? 
  no , but it did n't really matter . 
  2014 will be a year of many things , but not whitewashing ww1 to portray it as anything other than a clusterfuck of epic proportions and the worst example of european empire building at that time . 
   oh cmon , that 's not only a joke , but a self-deprecating joke because of the world cup win being in 1966 . 
  it is an increasingly tired joke . 
  what is now the uk was very fortunate and ( internal fighting aside ) has n't had any serious invasion since the normans . 
  there is an arrogance . 
  the politics leading to ww1 is often overlooked and there is a narrative of ww2 where britain stood alone against evil german expansion , ignoring the rest of the british empire . 
   are you going to accuse canada , australia , new zealand and all the other commonwealth members with qe2 as their head of state as wanting their own empires now ? 
  my point was that the political system in the uk has not changed since the empire days , and furthermore there is still little to no talk of reform . 
  the current foreign office is just the old foreign office a hundred years later . 
   regardless of that , they had nothing to do with empire , if so we did a pretty bad job with the whole facilitating democratic elections and leaving after a few years thing , no ? 
  we ca n't detach ourselves from the current problems in the middle east . 
  we 've been in and out of afghanistan and iraq for years . 
  * but it is more to do with how the uk sees its role in international relations . 
  we fall in line with american foreign policy and go against the un . 
  when people go on about the uk 's nostalgia for the empire , this is the sort of thing they are referring to . 
   you do n't seem to understand what the news is , it 's always negative , that 's what it does , do you really think that in other eu nations there 's constant programming about the boring debates on deciding standardised salt content in packets of crisps ? 
  often when policies are going through in the uk the same stuff is happening elsewhere or has already been done . 
  the media really does n't perform analysis on this ( the earlier examples you gave of free schools , german economy . 
  these are more often points pushed by politicians and reported as such ) . 
  citizens of other european countries tended to be more clued up on what their neighbours are doing ( also what the uk is doing ) .

  kid gloves ? 
    there is however celebrations of silly little battles years past  like what ? 
  two world wars one world cup . 
  fuck you napoleon . 
   what does monarchy have to do with empire ? 
  our constitutional arrangements are near exactly as they were when all the important bits of the globe belonged to britain . 
  there has been no reform , no grand change . 
  the koh-i-noor still sits in the tower of london . 
   we have a powerful military , a seat on the unsc and we 're more global ( both historically and currently ) than many other nations , it is our duty to `` interfere '' ( i.e consider ) things that go on in the world . 
  that is the very assumption which i question . 
  why should it be our duty ? 
  the unsc seat is a throwback to the empire days . 
  we are a relatively small country , why the hell do we maintain nuclear weapon capabilities ? 
   opinion and conjecture that i and many others disagree with , huge oversimplification if nothing else ; also nothing to do with empire . 
  not how the rest of the world sees it . 
  you should read up on the hashemites and the british east india company . 
   wat unit of power ? 
   europe is never out of the media . 
  the vague entity `` europe '' that allows all the muslimiac , polish , romanians to come here , steal , claim benefits and then not be deported because of `` europe '' 's `` human rights '' is never out the news . 
  any meaningful reporting of what is going in other european countries is limited to either the exceptional or the occasional radio 4 broadcast . 
  i disagree . 
  it is implicit , people do n't go around saying `` what about that empire eh ? 
  pretty impressive huh ? '' . 
  there is however celebrations of silly little battles years past , sacred cows in the form of the mother of parliaments and the royal family , and an automatic assumption that it is the uks duty to interfere in the affairs of other countries ( iraq and afghanistan both really were fuck ups ) . 
  there is no real effort to deal with our dark past whereas other countries have had it forced upon them ( still often hear excuses about building railways and introducing civilizations and other tosh ) . 
  we also fairly self obsessed and very much look inwards within the uk ( by which i mean london ) . 
  there is a lack of reporting on european affairs in the media , when something about another european country is mentioned it is nearly entirely negative . 
  comparisons to other european countries when policies are introduced barely get mentioned ( excluding the occasional token reference to finland ) . 
  there exists an insular culture that feels itself alien to europe and one of the results of this is an outdated foreign policy . 
  edit : tided up, 
   i think it should be up to the free market to decide what wages are appropriate . 
  and are the strikers then not just participating in the free market ? 
  these comments are getting increasingly confusing . 
  it would be nice to have the full process of seceding states renegotiated membership to the eu laid out in detail . 
  the scottish referendum is following the kiss principle . 
  it is a referendum on westminster , nothing more . 
  things like the royalty and the eu are important questions in their own right , each should be handled individually , not packed into one great big referendum . 
   perhaps you do n't like democracy ? 
  why do you hate democracy ? 
  the two party system in the uk is a perversion mainly caused by our voting system . 
  it is only a democracy in the loosest sense of the word . 
  it does nothing for proportional representation and has poor checks on executive power . 
  there was also the earthquake stuff in blackpool . 
  whats the solution ? 
  it is worth pointing out that in overall terms this will do very little to the economy and that scotland runs an energy surplus . 
  this is from a series of reports on how reporting of the scottish independence movement is allegedly reported in other countries reports . 
  ... maybes a tad convoluted . 
  the eu does n't dictate what countries do internally . 
  it is not within the scope of their powers . 
  it is not really the eu 's concern how things are handled within a country . 
  i always find it ironic when the daily mail or the telegraph go off on a rant about free tuition in scotland and that the agreement for eu citizens does not apply to england . 
  all these rags do is print hysteria about how the eu is impinging on uk `` sovereignty '' , but when it comes to tuition fees they complain that the eu ** does n't ** intervene and that the rules ** do n't ** apply internally . 
   why , what 's going to change over time ? 
  well the point at which i joined this conversation the discussion was that dutch and swedish universities are keen to attract english students . 
  this is true for germany as well , france has also be discussing about introducing courses taught in english . 
  this will lead to more targeted advertising and a greater awareness amongst potential students that there are considerably cheaper or free alternatives taught in english of comparable quality . 
  there is already an expectation that the number of people going to university will rise . 
  that has been the trend for years .
