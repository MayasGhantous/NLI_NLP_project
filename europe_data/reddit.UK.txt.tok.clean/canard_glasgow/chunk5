  and then the code to change all of the worlds inhabitants to legal citizens ? 
  this is the benefit of informative commenting and modular design . 
  the ulster banner is still popular in certain areas . 
  there is a pub just round the corner from me which has a massive one . 
   erc ( second party in the catalan parliament , likely winner in case of news elections ) proposes sept. 14th 2014 as the day ( referendum/consult ) . 
  [ fucking catalonian one-upmanship . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21828424 ), 
  wales . 
  where whalers come from . 
  bastards . 
  fair enough . 
   yes , and mine was n't wrong . 
  words have multiple definitions , as you just showed by using `` there '' twice . 
  your original statement was not with regards to voters . 
  it was   98.9 % of the natural citizens of northern ireland wanted to remain part of the uk it was later on that you changed to arguing about voters to make a ambiguous statement ( a cynic might think that was deliberate ) for which there exists an interpretation for which it is true . 
  but that was not your original stance and not what we are arguing about . 
   right , so , the troubles do n't give evidence of what public opinion is in northern ireland . 
  it 's a strawman , but it 's equivalent to what you 're saying . 
  but it is a very famous time in ni history . 
  i was referring to the time period . 
   several decades ago , yes . 
  also if you think there was only one referendum in 1973 worth taking into account , why are you mentioning several voting records ? 
  we can look at the voting records for the general election in [ 1970 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_general_election,_1970#results ) and in [ 1974 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_general_election,_february_1974#results ) , in particular for the republican parties . 
  given there was a famous boycott of the referendum by the republicans and the polling for that time disagreeing with the referendum results we can conclude that the 98.9 % was not representative of public support at that time , a little on the high side if truth be told . 
  all we can see from the referendum was that 58 % of voters in ni were for continued participation in the uk ( a clear majority ) . 
  countries can change yes , there is no evidence to show that it did so drastically . 
   ... that would be voters . 
  there are two defintions there . 
   do we know because of 9/11 that more than a tiny minority of muslims support terrorism ? 
  do we know because jfk got shot that more than a tiny minority of americans wanted him to die ? 
  this is a strawman . 
  support for irish re-unification does not equate to support for the incidents that were taking place at that time . 
  we can tell from voting records and opinion polls during the troubles and the way in which they started that support for irish re-unification was higher than 1.1 % . 
  so i stand by my original point . 
  the referendum in 1973 did not show that support for ni remaining britain was at 98.9 % . 
   countries change . 
  they do yes . 
  there is insufficent data in this one referendum in 1973 for us to say anything about that though . 
   you can still say the majority of people are against it yes . 
   and you can still say 98.9 % of voters were against it , no . 
  98.9 % of those that ** voted ** . 
  where the voter turnout was 58.66 % . 
  58 % of ** voters ** . 
   nor did it show that public support was less than 98.9 % , in any way . 
  it did n't no . 
  but public support was n't at 98.9 % which we know for other reasons , for instance `` the troubles '' . 
  and hence why your original statement   98.9 % of the natural citizens of northern ireland wanted to remain part of the uk is incorrect . 
   and in 1970s russia 100 % of the population supported the communist party . 
  countries change . 
  we are talking about a particular referendum . 
   if you boycott the election , you do n't get to claim that any vote other than your one would have been cast . 
  yes . 
  but it removes legitamacy for the referendum ( which was in part their aim ) . 
   it equally could be the case that over 99 % of people in northern ireland supported staying with britain & co. , and did n't turn up because they knew that popular opinion meant the result was definite . 
  right , but that is not what the referendum showed . 
  and , in 1970 's ni , that was n't the case . 
   that 's not how referendums work . 
  i do n't know what you mean . 
   and even if it was , 98.9 % of 58.66 % is still a majority . 
  it is a majority yes . 
  but it means that it is not the same as the falklands ( where voter turnout was 92 % and there was n't a group boycotting the referendum ) and it means that the statement ,  98.9 % of the natural citizens of northern ireland wanted to remain part of the uk is not correct, 
  there was a boycott from the republicans . 
  the figure 98.9 % was on 58.66 % of the franchise , as one of the posts above mentions . 
  it seems to me that at some point you 'd end up with a power struggle between the states and the eu . 
  there would need to be some rebalance of powers , i would prefer at that point powers that are not needed by the eu were given down to a much more regional level . 
  i can understand the need for a larger unit of government for administration , but i do not see that it needs to be based around countries . 
  a type of state that the details of which are largely accidents of history . 
   sorry i thought this thread was about personal opinions on scottish independence , i was sort of hoping that the nationalist mafia could leave people alone to voice those feelings without jumping on us , big mistake of mine . 
  when you state things as snp policy that is not just an opinion . 
   the nato thing is the definition of a backtrack the nato thing was a policy change at the conference last october . 
  a motion was tabeled . 
  party members voted . 
  the offical party policy then changed http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19993694 it is only a back track if a party is elected into government on a promise of removing scotland from nato , and then changing when they are in power . 
   the monarchist thing is populist yeah it is . 
  that does n't change the fact it has been snp policy for years . 
  from the 1997 manifesto . 
   the snp propose the reform of the monarchy which , while allowing the queen and her successors to remain head of state , would ensure that their duties and payments were clearly and openly understood . 
  http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/ge97/man/snp97.pdf  joining nato will require you to let nuclear vessels dock that is your intepretation of what you think will be the eventual outcome of a very complicated international agreement . 
  but that does not equate to a change in snp policy , nor a backtracking . 
  http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/snp-conference-support-for-nuclear-weapons-ban-1-2854686  i 'm not english , i 'm not scottish but very much british and very much a british nationalist . 
  you ruin the debate . 
  you accuse everyone that disagrees with you of being some anti-english , racist nationalist and the minute your bullshit is called out you accuse people of trying to oppress and silence you . 
  if you want europan federalization , how do you see that coming about ? 
  do big countries of 50 to 80 million people like germany , france , uk and spain have a place ? 
  can europe work with them dominating ? 
   the snp was staunchly opposed to all of these things for almost all of its history right up until a couple of years ago . 
  not it was not . 
  the official party policy on nato was to withdraw and that policy was changed at the last party conference ( so not a backtracking ) . 
  the snp have been monarchists for decades , at least since the scottish parliment opened . 
  they are also still firmly againist nuclear weapons being on scottish soil . 
  yet again salvaxe you are stating your personal opinions as facts on scottish and british politics , which you evidently know nothing about . 
  you misrepresent the [ fleg wavers ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fisbxiazo4o ) , [ idiots living in the 17th century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belfast_city_hall_flag_protests ) , the only people that really gave a damn about what flag was flown by whom at wimbledon ( and the only reason they cared was that it was the [ day after street marches celebrating a battle that took place hundereds of years ago that no one else gives a flying fuck about ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orange_walk ) ) . 
  you confuse the indepdence movement for the snp ( there is an overlap but they are still very much different things ) and you come away with rubbish like this  is it just personal ego trip for salmond and a bunch of rabid english-hating nationalists ? 
  which shows you do n't even follow the debate . 
  when ? 
  where ? 
  to what ? 
   backtrack on nato , currency/fiscal policy , the queen , hosting nuclear weapons , backtrack ? 
   it does n't help salmond 's image that he casually promotes images of crappy films like mel gibson 's ` braveheart ' and other bogus symbols of nationalism .
