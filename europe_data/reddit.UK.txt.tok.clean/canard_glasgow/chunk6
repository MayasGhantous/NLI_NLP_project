  that is not entirely true . 
   has a ` federated kingdom ' received an discussion ? 
  it did , but was quickly and thoroughly dropped . 
  the three main westminster parties made it a line in the sand that any referendum is restricted to in or out with no third options ( even the lib dems , despite ferderalism officliy being a lib dem policy ) . 
  since then there has been no one taking a holistic view of the uk system of government . 
  ** as directly ** again , the eu uk argument . 
  if the uk were to leave the eu , it would affect everyone in the eu . 
  however it affects those in the uk more . 
  so the vote should not be eu wide . 
  devolution worked great with labour in power at westminster and labour in power at holyrood . 
  now we have the two most hostile parties ( for different reasons ) holding the reigns ; the conservatives dominating in the westminster coalition , and the snp with a majority in holyrood ( in a system that was never designed for a majority ) . 
  the weaknesses are being made clear especially with regards to funding , taxation and welfare ( for which westminster hold all the purse strings ) . 
  also , energy policy is still a reserved issue . 
  affects , yes . 
  but not directly as it does in the case of scotland . 
  the data is from the recent / r/europe survey http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1imf4r/the_results_are_in_the_official_reurope_survey/, 
  it seems to me entirely unfair that someone should have a vote on local an issue if they have moved away . 
  i like the resediency criteria , it means the franchise has nothing to do with any form of ethnic nationalism . 
  the eu is a seperate situation as britons have both eu citizenship and british citizenship . 
  there is no ambiguity as to who is a citizen . 
  this is not the case for scotland . 
  i do n't think anyone will be forced into a citizenship ... that is not how these things have worked in the past . 
   the rules mean that anyone from anywhere in the ~ ~ world ~ ~ ** eu/commonwealth ** can vote as long as they are resident here ftfy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#date_and_eligibility, 
  because the bakeries are in germany ? 
  they are making an effort to keep the bill passing through westminster and the bill passing through hollyrood keep in step with one another . 
  there are some issues with pensions and gender recognition . 
   basically , your history is british history whether you like it or not . 
  your ancestors are n't free of wrong doing any more than mine are . 
  at no point did i say that they were . 
  but we need to put the past behind us . 
  we can not indefinitely harken back to a glory age , ignoring the unsavoury parts that accompanied it . 
  and why arguments for the union based on the darien scheme ( a move by nobility over 300 years ago ) should not be applicable today . 
  with fptp it does n't really matter . 
  in 1992 john major got 41.9 % of the vote and struggled with a low majority in the 20s that slowly fell apart during his time in office . 
  in 1997 tony blair got a comparable 43.2 % of the vote and had a majority of ~ 100 . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_general_election,_1997 for the swings in seat numbers we are discussing , scotland was is irrelevant . 
  there is a labour advantage , but not as great as you might think and gerrymandering for labour is not really an argument for the union anyway . 
  let 's go for a citation . 
  undoubtedly a few , but protestant unionism dominates for those for whom it is a thing . 
  check the title of the main webpage  better together : the patriotic all-party and non-party campaign for scotland http://www.bettertogether.net/ for a while they were pushing `` real scots '' as a tag line . 
   `` alistair darling says better together campaign will be led by ** real scots ** ``  `` ** real scots ** backing britain -- forty scots from different walks of life spoke up for the uk at the better together launch . ''  `` in contrast to the separatist campaign , our materials do n't attack the other side of the argument . 
  we simply offer facts , and the perspective of ** real scots ** who offer their reasons for sticking together in the uk . ''  `` the better together launch event on monday was a great success and we could n't have wished for a better start or better reaction from the media . 
  it was all a marked contrast to the celebrity soaked snp event of a few weeks earlier and recognised as such because what we had were ** real scots ** proclaiming their belief in the value of the union to them as scots and saying so unashamedly and directly . ''  `` better together was launched in june this year by labour , the conservatives and the liberal democrats and since its formation it has been aiming to reach out to and be focussed on ** real scots ** from all walks of life . ''  `` where the snp had a few foreign-based luvvies telling us how much they loved scotland , the better campaign had ** real scots ** who actually live here telling us why they believed it was better for scotland to remain within the uk . '' http://wingsoverscotland.com/through-the-looking-glass/ ( ignore the tone of the article , but it sources the quotes ) `` most successful union '' is popular ( that is the one that tends to ignore some of the more interesting reasons for why we were so successful ) https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22most+successful+union%22+scotland, 
  not support for colonialism . 
  but they use words like patriot , claims like `` most successful union '' and a heavy focus on the past . 
  queen and country and what ho . 
   so the unpleasant history of empire has no relevance to the question of independence i would agree . 
  unfortunately it keeps getting dragged into the debate by proud , patriots that view the past 300 years with rose tinted glasses ( better together ) . 
  probably due to the fact that many of them are still living in the 18th century . 
  and lets not pretend that all the uk 's crimes are in the far distant past . 
  it was a flippant response to equally spurious nonsense . 
  salvaxe 's comments could n't be further removed from the debate if it tried . 
  a debate that is focused on issues of social justice and a democratic deficit . 
  not anti-english sentiment and with little nationalism . 
  personally i would n't care to cast such subjective speculations on why polls suggest 16 and 17 years old are more hostile to independence ( and just to make it perfectly clear , my last post was sarcastic ) . 
  aye , and ? 
  not more likely to be that the younger generations have just left school ? 
  where they have grown use to being told what to do and some of the more ... colorful actions of the british empire have been overlooked in history lessons . 
  just a working theory like ... 
   so your argument is that salmond pushed the enfranchisement when he knew that it would directly lower his chances of winning the referendum ? 
  well every indication so far shows that to be the case . 
   i doubt that the unionist parties would 've enfranchised 16/17yos to vote in the referendum if they had the choice , since common wisdom was that they would be more likely to vote for independence . 
  common sense ? 
  every poll so far suggests the opposite . 
  they supported similar measures in the past by franchising 16 and 17 year olds in the health board elections , when the snp was a minority government and before the independence referendum was likely . 
  they also could have abstained if they were against , but did n't want to appear like antiquated relics . 
   alex salmond is playing dirty by trying to get teenagers to be allowed to vote , because he knows that teenagers will be more easily manipulated , and that teenagers tend to have more romanticised ideas of nationalism than adults . 
  it had cross party support from two unionist parties . 
  thing is that support for the union does n't lie an insane amount ahead ( maybe 10 points ) . 
  they normally have a 20 % undecided block that say they will vote in the referendum . 
  a large enough proportion is on the fence to make it interesting . 
  if you are getting paranoid you might want to check out this page . 
  http://prism-break.org/ there are measures that you can take ( encryption ) so that even if your email is intercepted it can not be read . 
  most email clients have easy support for this ( i 'd recommend an open source one ) and lots of tutorials can be found on the web . 
  if you use a web based client or send unencrypted emails you should work on the assumption that someone will be able to read it . 
   get real before you call your betters lapdogs . 
  fuck off back to the 19th century if you want the british empire . 
   democracy is greater than courts . 
  i think it is quite a striking example of how much greece is being made to suffer . 
  there is no way that things like this are a good idea or that they will be beneficial to the greek economy . 
  yeah ... everyone here is pretty ashamed of that . 
  there is nothing worse than seeing a british stag/hen party when you are abroad . 
  you feel a compulsion to apologise to everyone on their behalf . 
  and good coffee . 
  spain knows how to make good coffee . 
  finland has just over half the infant mortality that the usa has . 
  yeah . 
  i 'd say ireland was probably the most surprising thing on this map, 
  there are different types of nationalism . 
  there is the `` my great , great , great grandfather thought ( and later fought ) your great , great , great grandfather was a cunt '' which we do so love in europe . 
  then there is the nationalism that is based on a common set of ideals , irrespective of race/religion/culture . 
  be careful of direct usa/european comparisons . 
  we already have elections in which eu citizens can vote without being uk citizens : local elections , eu election , even the scottish indepedence referendum . 
  i assume other eu countries have something similar . 
  why not ? 
   no , you can be consistent and argue against it !, 
  yes . 
  you can . 
  but that particular argument is not , because you claim to believe that a homosexual relationship is equal to any hetrosexual relationship and respect that they deserve the same rights yet disagree that they should be recongized as equal under the law . 
  i never said bigot .
