  i even said earlier that we should n't be so quick to label people bigots . 
  but claiming to be for homosexual rights and against equality of marriage is inconsistent and hence irrational . 
  as / u/halk said , you either believe in equaility or you do n't . 
  plenty of piss poor straight parents out there , is there any reason to assume same sex couples would be worse ? 
  any evidence to suggest this , or is it just a general , wishy-washy feeling ? 
  such as ? 
  an inconsistent or illogical argument - irrational, 
   `` give us jobs , not gay marriage '' well ... they 're going to need a lot of new registrars for all the gay monkeys called robert getting married ... 
   they can not however say that they are both for equal rights , and totally fine with gay people , and at the same time want them treated differently . 
  the can and they do . 
  it is not rational , but nor are most people . 
   i appreciate that it will take a long time for views to change , however that does n't mean views should n't be challenged . 
  yeah . 
  challenging it is very important . 
  but out of all those that oppose equal marriage , the people that genuinely hold this view are the easiest to bring round . 
  this response is typical of someone who has not given equal marriage any thought what so ever , not made any effort to analyse the arguments against and realize that equal marriage ** is ** an equality issue . 
  going in too fast with the bigot label , you wo n't win the argument . 
  people take time to come round to change , it is human nature . 
  homosexuality has been acceptable for a number of years now ( in certain countries ) , but the push for gay marriage is new . 
  i can understand that someone can be fine with the notion of same sex couples , but feel that the introduction of gay marriage is a societal change that they have not been part of or yet feel comfortable with . 
  a lot of people just assume equality exists , they do n't think about it until there is something splashed over the headlines . 
  immediately applying the bigot label to these people before they 've had time to think about the issue is counterproductive . 
  given a year or two and most of them will come round . 
  has the right wing not already promised to do that if they win the next election ? 
  yeah . 
  i would also be interested in a series of posts garnering responses for proposed ideas . 
  neoliberal is a troll . 
  ignore and move on . 
  having an opinion and being able to form a parsable sentence is not sufficient condition for a valid world view point . 
  vague , unsupported , insulting assertions are nonsense even if the poster managed to get the commas in the right bits  primitive culture and barbaric religion  let them deal with these savages the hard way ( and from a later response )  we all know their culture ( s ) are the problem , the ones they bring from their ravaged countries , their religion is a disease slowly poisoning every beautiful european country . 
  we know the problem , yet we do nothing . 
  can you prove i 'm wrong , please ? 
  you are not a beautiful snowflake . 
  people seem to have real problems with this . 
  to merely have an opinion does not mean that opinion has any value or worth or that people should respect it , it does not deserve an equal footing and nor should it get it . 
  if someone posts nasty , bigoted little things then they are a nasty little bigot . 
  do n't give them the same platform as someone who actually knows what they are talking about and is willing to defend a position . 
   romania sbr999 6 points 44 minutes ago  it 's obvious that islamists are the hardest to integrate due to their primitive culture and barbaric religion . 
  i saw a news video in which a muslim said something like this : `` the police come here to play allah with us '' . 
  i say give more power to the police , give them weapons . 
  let them deal with these savages the hard way , if the easy way does n't work . 
  6 upvotes guys ? 
  really ? 
  we 're ** that ** subreddit ? 
  i associate with a lot of non-native english speakers . 
  i 've found that i 've adopted americanisms by proxy from europeans . 
  caught myself saying the american aluminum the other day . 
  for north scotland there was the highland clearances a few centuries ago . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/highland_clearances the population is still less now that it was then . 
  has it ever been debunked ? 
  we stole the phrase from the spanish empire  el imperio en el que nunca se pone el sol, 
  we are in the common travel area with ireland . 
  no passport, 
   speaking english and watching the same american films does not mean the cultures are the same . 
  nor are scottish , english , welsh and northern irish cultures the same . 
  there is a cultural overlap , things in common that we call british culture . 
  many of these overlaps we still share with us/australia/canada / new zealand , what cultural aspects in particular do you feel are shared by all the countries in the uk that are absent from the aforementioned countries ? 
  are these overlaps important enough to justify the continued participation at westminster ? 
   the scotnats ' campaign is based on how different scotland and the rest of us are , therefore scotland should secede . 
  bollocks . 
  the independence referendum is based on the democratic deficit that exists in the uk . 
  this comes down to two points with regard to scotland . 
  there is a difference in political ideology north and south of the border ( as can clearly be seen by electoral results ) and the current constitutional arrangements are not flexible enough to allow for this ( the tories currently have a free reign over large swathes of policy that directly affect people in scotland ) . 
  this has been the case for decades and was particularly severe during thatcher 's time . 
  the attempt to allow for flexibility within the union , namely devolution , has not went far enough . 
  it has been made abundantly clear that no further serious powers will be devolved and england is not willing to join in a move to federalization . 
  all these scare stories we hear about losing our culture , having our airport 's bombed and borders being put are the unionists trying to distract from the real issue and deflect from the questions that are put to them . 
   there are no genetic / racial differences between scotland and the other inhabitants of britain ; and why would anyone care about this at all ? 
  why would you feel that needs to be made clear ? 
   ireland and australia are n't british any more and diverged very quickly after political separation . 
  still a strong cultural overlap in films , tv , art , literature , etc. 
  ( consider also the us , very effective in the production of media ) . 
  the dark sense of humor remains , the cooking remains , what is it you think has been lost ? 
  irish culture was never as closely integrated . 
  and we still do have an awful lot in common . 
   and the same is central to the snp 's objectives of destroying the u.k family and requiring passport checks to get the train to edinburgh . 
  what the fuck is this ? 
  what passports ? 
  who is proposing passports to get to edinburgh ? 
  why would anyone want that ? 
  this something you 've made up and are now stating as an snp policy . 
  meaningless scare stories . 
  british identity , culture , humor , cooking ( other euians do n't laugh ) , fashion ( again , do n't laugh ) are not dependent on sending 50 mps down to vote at westminster on english issues in order to indirectly set the budget for the scottish parliament . 
  there are numerous other shared cultures round the world that are not dependent on archaic political institutions . 
  to suggest that independence will destroy british culture is just another meaningless scare story . 
  for some people gdp on a spreadsheet means more than inequaility , poverty and illhealth . 
  yeah , hence support for translation services . 
  government needs to be understood by the people it represents . 
  no one speaks esperanto . 
  i doubt ukip will get a westminster seat next election and most voters will probably return to the three main parties for the general election ( although the support for the big three might not be as strong as it was in elections past ) . 
  the problem with fptp and ukip is that they act as a pressure group on the main parties ( you ** need ** the popular vote for 50 % of seats , swing voters are more important than the core support ) . 
  the conservatives and labour have already made noises and policy changes about the eu and immigration to pander to ukip supporters . 
  the effect of ukip will not be measured by number of seats in parliament , but what they change about the big three parties . 
  scotland here . 
  it is not as difficult to get on the housing market here as it is in other parts of the uk , this link may give a feel for things http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/scots-now-face-11-year-battle-to-buy-first-home-1.1077111 we suffer from the british obsession with home ownership . 
  most lettings are [ short assured tenancies ] ( https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-agreements-a-guide-for-landlords-scotland/short-assured-and-assured-tenancies ) that are not great for [ renters ' rights ] ( http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/advice_topics/renting_rights/renting_from_a_private_landlord/short_assured_tenancies#what_are_my_rights%3f ) . 
  councils housing stocks are [ low ( been decreasing since 1980 's ) ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/statistics/browse/housing-regeneration/hsfs/stock ) , although the scottish government looks set to end `` right to buy '' a controversial policy whereby council house residents could buy their house from the local authority ( this is largely blamed for the fall in stock ) . 
  house prices vary , # 60,000 to ridiculous amounts for a 2 bedroom house depending on where you look at . 
  mortgages require a deposit of 20 % ( i think there are various schemes to help first time buyers with this ) and seem to allow people to borrow 5 times their income . 
  i took this photo in troon , scotland the other day .
