burlusconi has paved the way for this style of outsider rabble rousing politics in the modern age , before being emulated on a grander scale by trump in america . 
  i 'd say [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq7kn2-gemm ) probably had more influence on the us , considering he had a lead for a while in the '92 election polls . 
  pretty sure trump 's closer to ross perot than berlusconi . 
  if you make thousands more anti-brexit posts david brock might finally start paying you . 
   he 's simply the first non-tory to be anti-eu . 
  [ riiiiight . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1975#no_campaign_.28national_referendum_campaign.29 ), 
   he simply took advantage of 30 years of anti-eu lies from the ` newspapers ' of the uk , the tories have been wrestling with this for decades . 
  ah , the luegenpresse . 
  what next , the ` stab in the back ' myth ? 
  merkel was a marxist with links to the east german regime in her youth . 
  should we be worried about germany turning into a communist dictatorship ? 
  heck , some of the founding members of the eec had links to or were nazi and soviet collaborators . 
  i expect to see the same people that cheered on the ` march for europe ' protests now attack farage for organising a similar thing . 
  might want to check the polls . 
   stuart claims she has been called a traitor by eu supporters in the uk and abroad . 
  `` i never received abuse in the united kingdom for being german , '' she says , `` but i now receive it from germany by people who tell me it 's in pursuit of being good europeans . '', 
  [ andrew marr , 1992 ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/leading-article-nauseating-and-pathetic-1559689.html ), 
  i see some people are still on here posting the same old crap months after the referendum . 
  bit like the japanese holdouts after ww2 . 
  [ even murdoch once wanted in . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/feb/04/did-national-papers-pro-european-bias-in-1975-affect-the-referendum ), 
   murdoch told them so . 
  [ indeed he did .

  and yet we 'll somehow still be better off than the average romanian . 
   the eu is a machine for preventing us fighting each other , someone 's been living under a rock for the past few years . 
  it 's strange how the eastern euros complaining about xenophobia are also some of the biggest xenophobes themselves . 
  because most hardcore eurofederalists hate any country that is n't an eu member . 
   a military excercise in texas is the sign that ` the feds are coming to take over ' .

  this sub since june 23rd . 
  remind me , what 's the status of ttip and ceta again ? 
   american propaganda is far more sophisticated and efficient . 
  favourable trade deals does not equal ` eu trade ' . 
  i take it the 1975 referendum was also not a sane pragmatic decision then ? 
  ah , i see now . 
  it was clearly a stupid idea to extend the franchise to the poor and women . 
  we should roll back those reforms and only allow university graduates who make over # 100k per year to vote . 
  perhaps we should even do away with voting and have a dictatorship instead . 
  a stab in the back myth , eh . 
  i wonder where i 've heard that one before . 
  might want to get off reddit and get back to writing columns for the guardian . 
   49 percent of respondents said the government should prioritise getting favourable trade deals that 's some interesting spin going on in the headline there . 
  of course the guardian would try and add some spin to it . 
   in next month 's autumn statement i was n't aware we were supposed to leave by november . 
  so i suppose all the tories who wanted to leave in 1975 should n't have bothered because we had a labour government ? 
  should they have also voted for michael foot in 1983 ? 
  [ deficit intensifies ], 
  current forecast predicts the tories will take one seat away from the snp , and all the rest will remain as they were in 2015 . 
  still not the 20 odd seats they got under thatcher though . 
  scotland played its part in british colonialism , no matter how hard nationalists try to whitewash it . 
  funnily enough ukip do n't support this policy . 
  so the welsh do n't exist then ? 
   british redditors wo n't stop bashing the eastern europeans b [ citation needed ], 
  so the dnc is n't good at the cyber and is now going full mccarthyist . 
  that 's strange , i do n't remember obama commenting on our election last year . 
  whatever your opinion of trump , shitting on a potential next president of the us is n't exactly a good idea . 
  no , i do n't think they should do that . 
  eu-us relations are going to be pretty interesting if he does win in november . 
  it 's the [ giant sucking sound ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkgx1c_s6ls ) of political talent . 
  been us foreign policy since the fifties , although their main reason for doing so - the threat of the ussr , disappeared in the nineties . 
  is this the same john kerry that said we should remove assad , thus leaving a power vacuum for isis/the ` moderate ' rebels to fight the iraqis/kurds , and also set us up for another confrontation with putin ? 
  remind me , when was the last time the eu 's budget was audited ? 
  more proof that the independent is a shit paper . 
  the tories , the tories , the tories the bankers the bonuses !, 
  i do n't recall the eurosceptics immediately arguing for a re-run of the 1975 referendum , even if it was won on lies . 
  they voted 6-1 in favour of a referendum bill . 
  something something the ira apologist is back on his alt again !, 
  nobody should take this delusional moron seriously . 
  and as usual the comments here gave me cancer . 
  more proof that the indy and it 's counterpart the guardian are as clickbaity as the mail/sun/express . 
   we 're being forced bow the wishes of england . 
  wales also voted to leave and so did ~ 44 % of ni , but do n't let that get in the way of your narrative . 
  everyone knew at the time that the conservatives were promising a referendum on the eu if they were re-elected . 
  even sturgeon spoke out about it . 
  nice to see that david brock is getting his moneys worth . 
  apparently not letting people in just for being european and instead looking at what they can contribute to the economy and society is racist . 
  what 's amazing is that this argument comes out from people who are defending a policy where we establish a rigorous points system for people from majority black and brown nations , but allow anyone in from a couple dozen white-majority countries . 
  heck , if you were a white supremacist , it 's pretty much the closest you could get to a `` white australia '' style immigration policy in the 21st century . 
   a duplicitious traitor . 
  so i take it you 're ` mr death to traitors , freedom for the eu ? ', 
  if you want to talk about lies , [ i 've got a bridge to sell you .

   as long as there are more than 9 member states willing to deepen their defence co-operation . 
  so the remain campaign lied about us having a veto . 
  brilliant . 
  he also opposed the armenian genocide . 
   who cares about big banks . 
  * cough * 2008 * cough *, 
  it was very slightly modified and then ratified as the lisbon treaty . 
  just like the ` european constitution ' was . 
  i wonder what backdoor they 'll use to pass it this time . 
  it 's become a click bait trash rag .
