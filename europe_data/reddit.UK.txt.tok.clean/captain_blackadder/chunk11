  remind me , which party currently has a majority in poland ? 
  instead of encouraging them to make the trip into europe we take our refugees from camps in the middle east . 
  luckily we take ours from the actual refugee camps . 
  george soros is also involved . 
  this is what happens when you let millions of people in without vetting them . 
  i can only hope there are n't any far-right reprisal attacks . 
  sutherland 's twitter feed after brexit is hilarious , though . 
  if we commissioned a chilcot style report into the bbc we 'd probably end up shutting them down . 
   his decision dragged the uk out of a decade-spanning recession https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%e2%80%9375_recession#united_kingdom, 
  or we could restart the original efta instead . 
  should 've never left it really , but ted heath was n't a bright person . 
  eu still wants to waive visas after the coup though . 
  i bet you 'll still be screaming racist when they become the first mainstream party to elect a mixed race leader . 
  i did try to find the non-rt version , i know what their agenda is . 
  i suppose we should have expected the worst to happen . 
  i want to get off mrs merkel 's wild ride . 
  piss off . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gm9q8uabts  `` it 's even more serious than economics because if you rob people of their identity , if you rob them of their democracy , then all they are left with is ** nationalism and violence . 
  ** i can only hope and pray that the euro project is destroyed by the markets before that '', 
   they started as liberal $ skeptic right wing party but the nutjobs and far right mobbed the liberals out of the party and took over :(, 
  soros is just as bad as murdoch . 
  the nazi war economy was pretty crap because goring shat on stresseman and scacht 's work . 
  one border guard on duty is n't `` strong borders '' . 
  for people who still think this is a good idea : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kar%c3%a1nsebes, 
  get out whilst you still can . 
  i really wish we had n't left efta for this crap . 
   yes yes yes , and enjoy the exits that follow . 
  nick clegg can never catch a break . 
  enjoy the inevitable war with russia over ukraine that this will result in , as both sides continue to escalate tensions . 
  we 'll just sit back and take in the refugees . 
  remove your troops from crimea first . 
  stop electing incompetent politicians . 
  do n't elect the far-right/left instead , though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_wednesday https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_debt_crisis, 
  at least we 're devolving powers , the eu seems to be keen on centralising them . 
  well if certain german politicians had n't made certain decisions we would n't be seeing regular islamic terrorist/sex and far-right attacks/hate crimes and therefore less people would be dead . 
  letting in millions of refugees without vetting them has resulted in this , and it only makes it harder for the genuine refugees ( i.e the ones from syria/iraq/afghanistan / libya and not the economic migrants ) because they 're now going to be tarred with the same brush . 
  uncontrolled immigration simply leads to nationalism and violence . 
  rather than integration , there is segregation . 
  i suppose us indirectly funding saudi wahhabism more than the peshmerga and iraq does n't help . 
  it 's sad , but incompetence on a massive scale that started with the iraq war has cost and will continue to cost lives . 
  yes , i 'm aware that he 's a threat , but you ca n't blame one person for everything . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_free_trade_association#history  in the first meeting since the brexit vote , the efta organisation reacted by saying they were open to a uk return . 
  swiss president johann schneider-ammann told reporters that its return would strengthen the association . 
  perhaps it 's time to reestablish efta as a separate entity . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36671540 http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-amato-iduskcn1012q8 etc, 
   the eu the eu did n't exactly stop merkel from overriding the dublin convention and letting in millions without actually vetting them , which has led to incidents like the cologne sex attacks and far-right reprisal attacks . 
  meanwhile afghani interpreters are being abandoned by nato countries . 
  well at least we do n't have a corbynist ~ ~ republican army ~ ~ terror group over here . 
  yes , because flooding the uk with cheap labour works out so well for the migrants coming here and said poorer countries . 
  just because we had what you class as a `` good deal '' does n't mean we should have stayed in . 
  some would consider ted heath selling us out , the erm scandal/recession + blair giving away half our rebate for nonexistant cap reform a bad deal . 
   they commit to this project http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/8181392/tony-blair-eu-rebate-surrender-to-cost-billions-more-than-estimated.html, 
  replace gulen with jews and bolsheviks and you 've got hitler . 
  remove gulen remove gulen you are the gulenist stink you are the gulenist smell ? 
  we 've had a government in power since 2010 that 's been dealing with the nanny/state welfare system i.e making it so minimum wage  dole for those who are able to seek jobs . 
  if only orwell could see society now , where people are advocating overturning a referendum result because the people chose the `` wrong '' choice . 
  aww , did the people vote the wrong way ? 
  it almost seems as if european politicians are in favour of holding referendums on [ joining the eu ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2833889.stm ) , but not on leaving it . 
  then again , we entered two years before we held a referendum on membership . 
  do the people who post these sort of comments ever think about what non-eu migrants have to go through / the exploitation of freedom of movement with regards to cheap labour or are they just all entitled european nationalists who are only worried about their sex tourism ? 
  `` what kind of internationalism puts a german over an indian or a frenchman over an australian ? '', 
  - barbara castle, 
   there is a reason london voted to stay compared to the closed minded uneducated xenophobes living in the god forgotten places . 
  lol you 're fucking pathetic . 
  carry on acting like that and you may as well apply to be a spokesman for ukip , because people like you are delivering them votes on a silver platter by not actually listening to legitimate concerns about immigration . 
  it 's planet islingtion that 's living in its own little champagne socialist bubble , not the rest of the country . 
   far-right political parties are making huge gains across countries as new champions of a working class alienated by the cosmopolitan left welcome to mainland europe , do enjoy your stay . 
   the uk was one of the few big members not to use the brake on eastern europe . 
  because blair wanted to flood us with cheap labour and exploit migrants on low wages in return for easy labour votes . 
  he also gave up half our rebate for nonexistant cap reform . 
  malta had a referendum on joining the eu , and the in side won on 53 % . 
  i do n't remember anyone calling for supermajorities back then . 
  no , there seems to be quite a lot of support for them , and there really should n't have been a shorts ban in the first place . 
   if you expect to be allowed access to our market , you should wrap your head around the fact that everything you have , in terms of business or social opportunities , we want it !, 
  it 's ours !, 
  it belonges to us !, 
  you do n't get to share your pie , with your bullshit commonwealth or any other nation that 's not whit us , and then expect a slice of ours !, 
   you have a problem with immigrants ? 
  start bitching about eu immigrants after you 've deported your millions of brown commonwealthers !, 
  those are our opportunities they 're occupying . 
   everything you have is ours for right of first refusal , there is no in-between !, 
   norway has a population of 5 million , as a market , it 's impact on the eu is minimal to barely noticeable . 
  the same goes for the 8 million swiss and the 350k islanders . 
  they get a pass , because they 're small . 
  fuck off you entitled prick . 
  this is one of the reasons why people voted to leave - eu migrants were given special treatment whereas non-eu migrants suffered for it . 
  blair even exploited eu migrants for cheap labour and easy labour votes . 
  the bnp gets fuck all in terms of votes . 
  however , over in france , the far-right fn are quite popular . 
  perhaps if people stopped calling everyone who wants controls ( not necessarily a drop ) on immigration a racist then they 'd stop ending up on the losing side of referendums . 
  even then , it was n't all about immigration - ukip recieved ~ 4 million votes a year ago , leave got ~ 17.4 million . 
  someone 's salty . 
   the motivations behind the leave vote , anything from pretty nationalistic chauvinism to outright racism should n't be pandered to . 
  so wrong it 's laughable , really . 
  the eu can take the gulenists and the akp supporters , we 'll take the liberal ones . 
  eu expansion led to the influx of cheap labour , brussels is full of lobbyists . 
  it would simply be replaced with russian influence . 
  add in `` screwing over african farmers '' and you 've got cap in a nutshell .
