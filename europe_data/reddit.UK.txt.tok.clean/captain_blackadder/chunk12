  there 's no need to be salty about it . 
   french bashing campaign 1415 best year of my life never forget, 
  they turned on the eu , not the `` slaves '' . 
  blair was heavily in favour of allowing the eu to expand so there would be an influx of cheap labour and people on low wages usually vote labour . 
  [ france is bankrupt ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-is-totally-bankrupt-french-jobs-minister-michel-sapin-embarrasses-francois-hollande-with-8471077.html ) and has a socialist government + anti-business laws . 
  [ hollande is even upset about plans to cut uk corporation tax . 
  ] ( http://en.rfi.fr/europe/20160711-france-slams-uk-tax-cut-plan-hollande-plans-post-brexit-eu-tour ), 
  fn would be more comparable to the bnp , not ukip . 
  norwegian prisons are remarkably good compared to the rest of europe . 
  i doubt he 'd like to be transferred to one of ours . 
  is this happens because we are from lithuania ? 
  a life sentence in prison is far worse than an early death , and without the death penalty you can compensate + release someone if there was a mistrial/false evidence , because they 're not dead . 
   they have paid for it ( in actual us-dollars ) , they paid human traffickers outside of the eu for a trip . 
  something should be done about that , but direct action can only be taken by local authorities . 
  well if the centre-left/centrists/centre-right can address legitimate concerns about terrorism migration in a fair and sensible way , support for the far-right will probably decrease . 
  whether that will happen remains to be seen . 
   who gives a fuck what breivik thought ? 
  the far-right , who have more support than they did back then . 
  iirc breivik blamed the left for islamic terrorism because they encouraged it or some other weird conspiracy theory . 
  nobody 's denying that this or what 's currently happening in germany is a terrorist attack . 
  it 's sad that they just opened the border to all these entitled people without actually checking to see if they have a legitimate case for asylum or if they 're from syria/iraq etc yet still refuse to offer afghani interpreters from the war asylum . 
  a government sets up refugee camps and offers you aid so you do n't have to live in a warzone and your response is to go on hunger strike and attempt to cross the border into hungary , where the border guards will probably just violently shove you back across the border . 
  what a strange world we live in . 
  breivik was obviously a deluded nutjob , but i believe he 's referring to the increase in terrorist attacks . 
  sad fact is , far-right groups like the fn are gaining support and they 'd probably think he has a point . 
  sane people would still view him as a disgusting mass murderer , though . 
   british flag on the communist building well if the ussr had been more co-operative we could have ensured that there were no communist buildings in poland . 
  sadly all the poles in the russian army died in the warsaw uprising , at least the ones who came over here had a higher chance of surviving . 
  farage wants controlled immigration and was one of the first to support the idea that anyone living here currently can stay . 
  we should just deport bnp supporters over to australia like we used to . 
  i 'm sure racism would decline . 
  there 's been a slight increase in racist nutjobs doing things racist nutjobs do , but it seems the media want to create some sort of hysteria about eu migrants being deported ( which the government wo n't do ) , and i think that 's causing them to worry more than they need to . 
  no , they 've been advocating scottish and irish natonialism recently . 
  it 's a real shame orwell 's no longer alive to see this . 
  a real shame . 
  i 'm sorry , has there not been a significant rise in support for far-right/left groups and an increase in terror attacks or am i just imagining things ? 
  the fn will likely make the second round of the french presidental elections , for example . 
  wait , i 've just seen your comment history . 
  you 're basically pete sutherland on steroids , idiot . 
  iraq was bush and blair 's fault . 
  sadly they 're not the ones who have to deal with the fallout . 
  all this excessive mass migration nonsense that stems from the iraq war , which the eu has failed to effectively deal with , has resulted in the rise of extremist far-right/left groups , increased nationalism and terrorist attacks from home grown and isis extremists . 
  yet more lives were lost today due to incompetence . 
  nah , you have n't seen any enoch powell quotes yet . 
   today 's threats are n't states . 
  north korea ? 
  the bruges group are a think tank . 
   or an article by the guardian based on greenpeace 's research . 
  yes , because the guardian are n't biased at all . 
  the good friday agreement clearly discriminates against muslims !, 
  this should be interesting . 
   at worst it 's a dumb comment . 
  all animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others it seems . 
  i assume your opinion on the ukip councillor who made a similar comment in regards to remain voters is that he `` just made a dumb comment '' then . 
  i do n't think [ ted heath selling us out ] ( http://campaignforanindependentbritain.org.uk/britain-europe-bruges-group/ ) + [ blair giving away half our rebate ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/8181392/tony-blair-eu-rebate-surrender-to-cost-billions-more-than-estimated.html ) for nonexistent cap reform = a good deal . 
  course , it must be sad knowing that the eu has fucked ireland over numerous times as well . 
   the uk is most definitely the country most obsessed with growth in the eu . 
  that was blair , and he was a moron . 
  `` what kind of internationalism puts a german over an indian or a frenchman over an australian ? '', 
  - barbara castle, 
  good . 
  is [ this man ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/labour-mp-sorry-for-coloured-skin-comments-10330955 ) a fascist as well ? 
  or perhaps he 's just a racist . 
  wew lad , what did the africans ever do to you for you to hate them so much ? 
  seems like there might be a power struggle sometime in the future . 
  nobody who actually knows who farage is would say that . 
  mackenzie is a twat for various other reasons , but he did n't say she should n't be reporting on it because she was a muslim . 
  the headline says :  `` why did channel 4 have a presenter in a hijab fronting coverage of muslim terror in nice ? '' always amazing how people are so eager to defend this sort of thing but not the appalling record in regards to women 's rights in the middle east . 
   `` they came out on the streets , and the army types did n't want to drive over them like they did in tiananmen square when they sort of drived them over , and that was the end of that . 
  people said , ` i 'm not going to drive over people . ' the people came out of their homes , and they were not in favor of what the military was doing . 
  never change donald . 
  the hitler speeches , praise of saddam and erdogan . 
  i assume the next proposal from the donald will be to disband nato and ally with putin . 
  thornberry is delusional and labour ca n't deliver on this promise , especially if corbyn wins . 
  john mann or gisela stuart would have been much better choices for the role but corbyn only seems to care about his leadership chances . 
  that and you 'll just get more people coming to calais if you let them cross the channel . 
   he 's a centre-right candidate , so he 'll never be perfect lol, 
  only the mayor of calais wants to remove it but she 's very unpopular in her own town afaik . 
  just because something as bad as that happened does n't mean it should happen again . 
  or perhaps i should remind you how [ the ira ended up collaborating with the nazis . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_republican_army_%e2%80%93_abwehr_collaboration_in_world_war_ii ) and as [ a thank you ireland recieved bombs from the luftwaffe . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_dublin_in_world_war_ii ) nobody wants to see a return to that sort of violence . 
  pot , kettle . 
  you mean like 43 % of scotland supporting trident renewal ( 42 % against ) , but only 1 scottish mp ( the tory ) voting for renewal ? 
   all of greece votes socialist but they then have to abide by a conservative government because the rest of europe [ tspiras would be proud . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/11733777/bewildered-greeks-left-wondering-what-happened-to-referendum-no-vote.html ), 
  eh , why not . 
  i do n't think [ ted heath selling us out ] ( http://campaignforanindependentbritain.org.uk/britain-europe-bruges-group/ ) + [ blair giving away half our rebate ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/8181392/tony-blair-eu-rebate-surrender-to-cost-billions-more-than-estimated.html ) for nonexistent cap reform = a good deal, 
  everything 's fine as long as soros keeps making money from it . 
  do we have freedom of movement with non-eu countries ? 
  what about people from non-eu countries ? 
  sounds like something the bnp would say . 
  maybe i 'm just being cynical then . 
  i guess we 'll have to wait and see . 
  i doubt erdogan will care , they 're still on the chopping block . 
  except that would encourage more migrants to come to france/calais as they 'd have easier access to the uk . 
  yes , as in accept the result of the referendum . 
  nobody 's stopping people from joining parties like the lib dems . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_sea_lion you do realise that we were practically alone apart from the commonwealth ( and refugees from occupied countries ) + us lend lease shipments for a decent part of 1940 . 
  the ussr and the nazis were on the same side until operation barbarossa .
