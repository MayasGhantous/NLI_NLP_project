   one of theresa may 's first acts as prime minister was to move responsibility for climate change to a new department for business , energy & industrial strategy . 
  informal negotiations with individual countries -  negotiations with the eu -  fta the independent is full of shit . 
  i was n't aware that we were dealing with a federal united states of europe . 
  he 's been in politics for 30 + years and used to hold the position of ` europe minister ' . 
  i think he knows what he 's doing . 
  erdogan is basically a turkish putin . 
   for very stupid reasons . 
  i 'd put money on it being between the eu and russia over ukraine 's eu membership . 
  we seem to be exporting a lot of salt to the french government . 
   44 % of british exports goes to the eu , while 8 % of eu exports goe to uk . 
  http://i.imgur.com/ygm1cqz.jpg  will lose years and renegotiating everything http://i.imgur.com/xwxoach.jpg, 
   they want the eu to collapse , the eurozone to collapse . 
   that will cause ww3 . 
  europhiles are so naive . 
  his job is to negotiate our deal with the eu , and he 's the best person for that job . 
  we have a massive trade deficit with the eu , whereas our exports to the eu are fairly static whilst our non-eu exports are on the up . 
  i 'm sure we 'd be able to raise tariffs on all those imports if he tries to play hardball . 
  each member state is going to want to protect its interests . 
  ireland is doing it here . 
  i wonder if we 'll end up with merkel v the other 26 member states . 
  [ is he going to be deported to turkey now ?

  the eurozone collapse was inevitable , it 's better for everyone if people start waking up to the fact that it is a failure of a project . 
  greece would have been in a much better situation had they left the eurozone , for example . 
  since when was boris a nationalist ? 
  he was also europe minister in the nineties iirc, 
   `` whats best for the uk '' would have been a remain-vote ;-) [ lol ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4sgcvf/euro_finance_ministers_agree_spain_portugal ) [ no ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21701756-italys-teetering-banks-will-be-europes-next-crisis-italian-job ), 
   http://www.itv.com/news/2016-07-13/donald-tusk-uk-and-eu-to-remain-closest-of-allies-following-their-divorce/ must 've been taking lessons in spin from alastair campbell . 
  lol, 
  i was only kidding , but if your leftist party does ever get a referendum they might find a lot of common ground with what tony benn had to say about the eu . 
  we 're already the world 's leading exporters of salt . 
  the previous referendum was held in 1975 . 
  we can loan you boris johnson if you want a referendum . 
  [ would n't surprise me if david davis ends up in the cabinet . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/27/britain-is-not-like-other-countries--even-the-sclerotic-eu-will/ ), 
   when the country voted in the referendum about europe a little more than two weeks ago , the message to politicians was clear . 
   we want out of the european union -- and we want serious change in the way politics works . 
   incredibly , lots of our political and business leaders have responded by showing that they still do n't get it . 
   some politicians -- democratically-elected politicians -- have even suggested the government should ignore the referendum result and keep britain inside the eu . 
   some business leaders , rather than planning for britain 's departure or thinking of the opportunities withdrawal presents , have chosen to complain about the result and criticise the voters . 
   well , i could n't be clearer . 
   there must be no attempts to remain inside the eu , no attempts to rejoin it by the back door and no second referendum . 
   the country voted to leave the european union and , as prime minister , i will make sure that we leave the european union . 
  had my doubts about her , but this seems pretty transparent . 
  looks like she was a closet eurosceptic ( like philip hammond ) after all . 
  [ stalinism intensifies ], 
  you do realise that these controls were most likely put in place because we could n't put caps on eu students . 
  now can can apply a fair policy for all , rather than a two-tier one that favours a specific demographic . 
  through immigration , rather than force this time . 
  [ eu bullying at its finest . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-european-commission-austerity-sanctions-debts-spain-portugal-a7120926.html ) where are the sanctions for france and italy ? 
  the markets stabilised because we 've got a new pm , not because she campaigned to remain . 
  if anything , she 's a closet eurosceptic like philip hammond . 
   french boats are currently allowed to fish up to six nautical miles from the british coast but eu laws prevent british vessels from fishing within 12 miles of the french coast . 
  nelson would be proud . 
  as opposed to george soros . 
   people have had enough by this point , are n't sure whose to blame , lash out by voting out of the eu the remain vote in 75 was won on lies , and there were no referendums on maastricht ( which created the political union ) or lisbon . 
  wanting to replay something until you get the result you want , i wonder where i 've heard that one before . 
   protectionst ? 
  look at all our trade deals . 
  and now look at efta . 
  no longer will our trade deals be held up by things such as romanian visas or italian tomatoes . 
  it also looks like we 'll be arranging a fta with china and india before the eu does . 
  [ the eu is a protectionist organisation . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/06/britain-must-ditch-its-protectionist-eu-trade-agreement/ )  dont like legal european immigration wanting control over immigration does n't mean you oppose it . 
  the govt simply chose to impose more restrictive controls on non-eu nationals because eu immigration could not be controlled . 
   rise of appreciation for ignorance , xenophoby , hatred , moronism, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_travel_area i thought us leave voters were supposed to be the thick ones . 
  oh , and the isolationist ones too , despite valuing internationalism over a protectionist supranational bureaucracy . 
  ah yes , the `` everyone who voted leave is a racist moron '' argument . 
   the greek people voted to stay in . 
  or george soros . 
  i think this might be his gillian duffy moment . 
  internationalism  supranationalism, 
  top kek, 
  we 'll give them back if you leave the eu . 
  top kek, 
  seems odd , because places like birmingham and leicester were almost 50:50 . 
  lol go take your bigotry elsewhere, 
   thatcher closed the coal mines http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/wilson-closed-mines/story-18821771-detail/story.html, 
  i ca n't wait for the next eurozone crisis . 
  this `` shit island '' will be taking in refugees from across europe . 
  http://i.imgur.com/m2gdlga.jpg same generation voted to remain in 1975 . 
  perhaps you should think about why they changed their minds . 
  well , i suppose we can rely on the lib dems to produce a [ longest suicide note in history v2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_longest_suicide_note_in_history ), 
  that was a poll of registered voters , and even if it was correct , it would imply that less young people voted remain - or more older people voted to leave . 
  the far-right and the far-left are on the rise throughout europe , largely due to dissatisfaction with the eu . 
  it would n't surprise me . 
  not at all . 
   64 % of registered voters key word here - registered . 
  same generation voted to remain in 1975 . 
  obama hates poles confirmed . 
  only more europe will lead to an increase in nationalist fervour and the downfall of the eu . 
  this man is a moron . 
  we do n't need a black panther-lite v police war over here . 
  our police do n't shoot black people on sight for starters . 
  right , let 's take a look at unemployment levels within the eu again . 
   brexit  no to internationalism .
