  i seem to remember a certain european leader who rose to power in 1933 favouring indoctrination of the youth . 
  `` i 'm absolutely outraged at the way people voted , the lies the referendum was based on and the divide in the country because of it . 
  my ideal outcome from this march is that mps realise that leaving the eu is not what people truly want . 
  it feels like our country has already changed . '', 
  the arrogance is unreal . 
  ah , yes , the `` everybody who voted leave is a racist '' argument . 
  nice generalisation of over 17m people . 
  and yet another europhile apologist appears . 
  i hear the czech president has called for a referendum . 
  that 's a win for me . 
  free to pursue our global ambitions whilst the eu collapses due to pressure from far-right morons ( who literally only exist because the eu does n't represent the wishes of the people ) . 
  either that or they piss off putin and start a war in ukraine . 
  wales 2 brussels 0, 
  at least the police are finally able to arrest these nutjobs . 
  european nationalism at its finest . 
  someone does n't like democracy . 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  anjem choudary did n't . 
  would 've been a 68 % majority under fptp . 
  http://campaignforanindependentbritain.org.uk/britain-europe-bruges-group/ lies , you say ? 
  well , we did abandon them by joining the eec . 
  yes - the eu and russia will go to war over ukraine . 
  out , and into the world !, 
  even farage has condemned the racist attacks . 
  the welsh are still in it . 
  same morons probably threatened to leave after their idol miliband did n't win the ge . 
  ca n't barrage the farage, 
  no , the status quo would have been 1973 . 
  india has been trying to negotiate a trade deal with the eu since 2007 . 
  they 've had 1 meeting . 
  ceta is currently being vetoed by romania . 
  this is just the start . 
  uh , actually we do . 
  they already are - india , australia , nz , ghana , canada , us , malaysia , iceland etc, 
  well if anyone is doubting their vote to leave they should n't be now . 
  and so the first domino falls . 
  he was corbyn 's mentor iirc . 
  hillary 's father was also a eurosceptic . 
  http://time.com/4381775/vladimir-putin-russia-brexit-uk/?xid=fbshare you 're proving putin right . 
  time to activate article 50 and be free from the eussr . 
  i would support greece voting to leave and take back control . 
  the eu is not europe . 
  the eu is n't europe . 
   ukip was on the only british party for the brexit . 
  no it bloody was n't . 
  do some actual research - there were campaigners on the leave side from a wide variety of parties . 
  spain would likely veto eu membership . 
   fuck everyone else , especially eastern europe . 
  reminder that the eu backed coup in ukraine led to putin unlawfully annexing crimea . 
  diane abbott currently getting grilled by dan hannan on the bbc . 
  we had one before 1973 . 
  i 'm sure we 'll be able to keep both . 
  thanks for the support . 
  i propose we let the spanish do it instead . 
  hopefully europe follows our lead . 
  who knew that salt mining would be positively affected by brexit, 
  whining when a democractic vote does n't go your way , wonderful . 
  oh the times was hard and the wages low leave her , johnny , leave her and the grub was bad and the gales did blow and it 's time for us to leave her leave her , johnny , leave her oh , leave her , johnny , leave her for the voyage is done and the winds do blow and it 's time for us to leave her i thought i heard the old man say you can go ashore and take your pay oh her stern was foul and the voyage was long the winds was bad and the gales was strong and we 'll leave her tight and we 'll leave her trim and heave the hungry packet in oh , leave her , johnny , leave her with a grin for there 's many a worser we 've sailed in and now it 's time to say goodbye for the old pierhead 's a-drawing nigh, 
  what a disgusting thing to say .

  boris has mentioned supporting campaigns for referendums in other eu countries i believe . 
  `` there 's a complicated overlap between sovereignty and power/will of the people , and to imply that one legal definition of sovereignty is conclusive of the whole issue is misleading . 
  consider , for example , scotland . 
  there 's a consensus that any ` yes ' vote in a referendum entitles scotland to leave the uk . 
  thus , there 's a theoretical case to be made that any ` sovereignty ' of the uk over scotland is merely ceded/conditional by scotland subject to the scottish people 's vote at any time . '', 
  `` michael dougan is beside clarity . 
  the one time he decides to give evidence is when he says ( paraphrased ) `` what about the evidence ? 
  well ... '' and then gives a single study . 
  after which , anything he says is either backed up by nothing or `` the study '' remains unlocatable or even unnamed . 
  he crafts a good narrative , glory to his speechcraft , but sadly his arguments must be marked for citation . '' `` i 'm still not convinced by the arguments . 
  you 've made an entirely negative case for leaving . 
  here 's why : you looked at things from a purely legalistic perspective , which is fine . 
  but essentially your point is we 're already too much involved and dependent that breaking up will be too painful . 
  it 's a bit like telling a crackwhore that getting off her drugs will be a calvary and that she 's done that to herself in the first place , so she should now live with the consequences and not try to stop her addiction . '', 
  `` to remain is in the `` national interest '' ? 
  or in the interest of a few ( super ) rich/global companies ? 
  explain who will benefit ? 
  i doubt that the thousands of lobbyists in brussels care for the lower or middle class . '' oh no , are the supposedly uneducated peasants making valid points ? 
  http://www.euractiv.com/section/trade-society/news/romania-will-veto-the-eu-canada-trade-deal/ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36596060, 
  no it is n't . 
  i 'm also pretty sure the majority of those who opposed the eec in 1975 would vote to leave and the majority of people supporting that campaign were labour mp 's - one of them was hillary benn 's father . 
  just because enoch powell ( or nigel farage in this case ) supports brexit does n't mean that it is n't a cross-party campaign,

  `` brexit is an opportunity for change . 
  real change . 
  a chance for britain to choose its own future . 
  we 're not the only country that wants to leave the eu . 
  we can set a trend here , which is why big business and the majority of politicians want us to ` bremain ' . 
  globalism , as it is , is bullshit . 
  the world is not ready for it , especially not the way it has been implemented . 
  we need to take our country , look after each other , and hold the politicians accountable for their actions . 
  being pro-remain does n't make you left wing , being pro-leave does n't make you right wing . 
  so please stop being self-righteous sanctimonious bellends . 
  stop trying to scare people into making a decision that benefits your interests and not their own . 
  people will vote however they want to vote . 
  stop branding them as racists , thick , or troublemakers just because they disagree with you . 
  it 's perfectly fine to have a different opinion to someone else . '', 
  `` the eu is a sham .
