  remain says turkey does n't meet the requirements to leave the eu , fine , but then to argue something like this is just plain hypocrisy . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqy2chx4d3u https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpp-n9oqj-y https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j-gb8pk2pk we 're `` whining '' for legitimate reasons . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j-gb8pk2pk  i just have this mental image of british nationalists , drunks and reality-tv stars voting about the world economy and it 's very disturbing . 
  both campaigns are cross-party . 
  people over here seem to think that if we leave the current government ( cameron will likely resign anyways ) will just impose draconian sanctions on workers . 
  jeremy corbyn 's even made a similar statement outright - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36508464 they argue that the eu is some paragon of virtue , and attack the leave side for spinning lies . 
  ah , yes , norway . 
  where the people say no to the eu but politicians slowly hand over legislative power to brussels . 
  why should we adopt that model ? 
  we voted for the eec , not the eu . 
  http://i.imgur.com/gazc8mz.jpg european nationalism simply will not work . 
  except that we 've tried to get eu reform . 
  cameron came back with barely anything . 
  we 're not greece , but just look at how they 've been treated , because syriza dared to challenge them . 
  i would be all for maintaining a free trade movement with europe , but the fact is the main principles on which the eu is built upon means that they will continue to push for further integration . 
  http://i.imgur.com/7prgxsk.jpg - they call this democracy we can recall our mp 's . 
  we can not recall our mep 's - they have immunity from prosecution . 
  and yet you mock us for voting brexit ? 
  the goal of the eu is a federal union . 
  your flag will be replaced with the flag of the eu . 
  juncker 's terrified , the eu 's a failure . 
  these are just drunken morons . 
  the people calling them cunts in the yt comments are correct . 
  guess what ? 
  i 'm voting for brexit . 
  campaigning should be carried out by the political parties . 
  our government spent # 9bn of taxpayers money on a pro-eu leaflet . 
  the money should 've come from party funds , or campaign grants ( these are given to both sides ) . 
  https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/116762 luckily during the eec referendum the government 's leaflet was impartial - it presented the case for both stay and leave . 
   they actively backing the vote remain campaign over here . 
  problem ? 
  the anti-eu parties are also backing the brexit , does it mean they should n't ? 
  pro-eu parties = back the eu pro-brexit parties = back brexit the eu should be impartial on such issues , so that any possibility of corruption can be avoided . 
  i would n't mind equal and fair regulations on spending for both campaigns , either . 
  tl , dr - i do n't realise that the eu can influence the decisions of member states . 
  they actively backing the vote remain campaign over here . 
  schulz himself had this to say over greece - http://hellenicinsider.com/european-parliament-president-martin-schulz-calls-for-regime-change-in-greece-are-we-seeing-a-financially-engineered-coup/  austerity sucks , i know it well . 
  however that is the fault of capitalism and the epp group that was elected by citizens to lead the eu . 
  it would be like blaming the uk parliament and the whole system because of the acts of the winning party . 
  the problem is the winning party , so vote someone else next time . 
  er , what ? 
  syriza was `` someone else '' elected on a mandate - that it would take greece out of the eurozone . 
  instead , it was forced to accept the bailout despite the results of the referendum . 
  this resulted in anger at syriza and so another government was voted in . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpp-n9oqj-y https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j-gb8pk2pk it 's the same thing lover and over again and many are fed up with it . 
  40 + years and history is repeating itself - the arguments for both sides are largely similar . 
  we were lied to on the eec ( no they said , further integration wo n't happen , they said , despite suppressing the werner report - no wonder thatcher went from europhile to eurosceptic ) sold out in 1975 and we 're being sold out now . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtu1paj6uvy boy i do love me some white middle class champagne socialists acting as if they 're the voice of our black and asian communities and know what 's best for them . 
  it 's patronising to our ethnic minorities . 
  an uninformed outsider . 
  trump is a racist us conservative - the american right is more extreme than the european right . 
  farage does n't want to build a wall - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyvat9io5ko&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=39m15s, 
  i voted for cameron by electing a conservative mp in my constituency . 
  i will vote to remove him from power in the next election should he stand as pm . 
  just as i would have ( and many did ) to remove brown 's oh so credible post-blairite government . 
  i do n't vote for an mep , i vote for a party that then puts forward a quota of candidates as mep 's depending on their share of the vote . 
  with the mep 's however , we 're voting for a party , not for a specific mep and their policies/views . 
  my local mp is an amazing person but if cameron remains as pm then i 'll be voting elsewhere , however if this were to change i might reconsider . 
  what , the reality that the eu is a corrupt institution ? 
  enjoy life in your little eu vanity project under president juncker 's whilst it pushes for further integration and takes legislative power away from the people , all the while pushing for an eu army and claiming to listen to those who want reform but never actually delivering on said promises . 
  we 'll be off to greener pastures . 
  long live eu nationalism / s, 
  the eu and their supporters are completely in denial . 
  they just flat out refuse to see it for the massive failure that it is and the misery it 's causing europe . 
  they talk it up as if it 's all worked out and it 's this eutopia that we would be crazy to leave . 
  it 's a failing superstate with an economy that 's been stagnant for the last decade . 
  they will not accept failure and will blatantly lie , cheat and steal if they have to to make it work .

  i think we 're in a very good position to negotiate trade deals with the commonwealth , whom we abandoned in 1975 when ted heath sold us out , just as dave is doing today . 
  thatcher luckily realised that we were promised a free trade agreement and given a path to further integration . 
  this condescending viewpoint is probably why we 've even got a referendum in the first place . 
  the people comparing the leave side to trump are deluded . 
   your rights as an eu citizen . 
  yes , because the eu citizens in greece have had their rights respected . 
  their country has been turned into a bankers colony , propped up by a pro-eu government . 
  http://i.imgur.com/7prgxsk.jpg - they have a history of ignoring referendum results . 
  austria and portugal have come very close to simply not allowing parties to form a government because they are anti-eu ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11949701/aep-eurozone-crosses-rubicon-as-portugals-anti-euro-left-banned-from-power.html , https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/austria-far-right-freedom-party-cries-foul-presidential-election-defeat ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqy2chx4d3u - as tony benn puts it , brussels now controls policy and that is undemocratic . 
  of course , vote leave will just simply halt all migration and turn britain into a fascist state the moment boris becomes pm on the 24th according to the remain camp . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j-gb8pk2pk - project fear 's so wonderful its being reused for this referendum enoch powell could n't have been more right , we 've been tricked - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqy2chx4d3u . 
  heath sold us out in 1975 ( and covered up the werner report ) , and now dave is doing the same . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqy2chx4d3u - benn 's argument that the eu is undemocratic - the system is wrong . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/4p0ad1/eu_and_greece_new_cuts_to_minimum_wages/ - greece turned into a bankers colony , schulz once threatened to replace the govt with eu appointed technocrats . 
  syriza was forced to accept a bailout the public did n't want , and ended up being replaced . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11949701/aep-eurozone-crosses-rubicon-as-portugals-anti-euro-left-banned-from-power.html http://i.imgur.com/7prgxsk.jpg - previous referendums ignored https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/austria-far-right-freedom-party-cries-foul-presidential-election-defeat `` the new president 's conciliatory language contrasted with a statement made earlier this year , when he said that if elected president , he would not swear in a new chancellor who wanted to `` destroy a united europe '' , such as the fp\u00d6 's strache , and that he would consider dissolving parliament and calling for new elections instead . '', 
  not at all . 
  of course , they applied these very same terms to the anti-marketeers in 1975 . 
  ted heath sold us out then , and dodgy dave is selling us out now . 
  if only peter shore , tony benn , barbara castle , enoch powell , margaret thatcher ( post-eec ) and the rest were still alive today . 
  we 'd have a field day . 
  oh , and as for farage/ukip - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtu1paj6uvy young middle class chamagne socialist calling ethnic minorities racist . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyvat9io5ko&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=39m15s his view on legal migrants, 
   either way the brexit will go bust in 2 days and you guys can move on . 
  we 'll be much better off outside the eu . 
  unlike the greeks , who have seen their country turn into a undemocratic bankers colony . 
   except that they do ... we want out . 
  dave wanted special treatment , and what did he get in return , when many were threatening a referendum - no substantial reform at all . 
  if our pm can not obtain pledges to reform the eu , why should we stay in a corrupt institution ? 
   fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists that is vote leave you 're delusional . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqy2chx4d3u - benn , who mentions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_european_constitution_referendum,_2005 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j-gb8pk2pk - shore https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpp-n9oqj-y - powell de gaulle did n't even want us to join in the first place . 
  those who want to leave do n't want special treatment , we want a europe of free trade ( what the eec was sold as ) and not an eu of federalist , protectionist integration .
