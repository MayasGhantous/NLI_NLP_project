  you really are a sad little man , are n't you ? 
  according to u/theflashyfinger we 're all thicko english nationalist racist plebs . 
  regrexit is a myth if you actually look at the polling done after the vote . 
  i 'm surprised he has n't been banned yet , given his previous alt was suspended rather quickly . 
  an mp was assassinated only a few months ago . 
  might want to think about that before you make such comments . 
  ahahahahaha you 're delusional, 
  which is strange , because the us played a major role in the founding of the eec . 
   the whole purpose of it is to protect us interests in europe during the cold war . 
  that was also the purpose of the eu , but i do n't see you calling for the abolishment of that organisation . 
  it 's because they 're selling euro-nationalism as some sort of european unity/internationalist utopia . 
   what is eu gon na do against will of people ? 
  would n't surprise me if they somehow do , brussels has its ways . 
  i thought you were against genocide ? 
   i call them junckers youth . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/13/eu-facing-an-existential-threat-in-the-wake-of-brexit-jean-claud/  announces creation of 100,000-strong eu `` youth corps '' to tackle refugee crisis, 
  joining the eec and leaving efta made things worse . 
  the recession did n't end until the late 70 's , either . 
  and then you 've got those sinosceptics over in japan , bloody nationalists do n't want to merge with china for some reason . 
  vote leave should 've replaced leadsom with bill cash . 
   the drumbeat of nationalist , eurosceptic populism something wrong with the eu ? 
  blame the fringe nationalist parties . 
  accuse mainstream eurosceptics of being populists . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  euroscepticism is the new mccarthyism . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g4xee-sdws a classic example of deceit by british politicians that has been happening for [ decades . 
  ] ( http://www.brugesgroup.com/media-centre/papers/8-papers/899-britain-and-europe-the-culture-of-deceit ), 
  is juncker going to recieve a strongly worded letter from nick clegg telling him that this is just a dangerous fantasy ? 
   announces creation of 100,000-strong eu `` youth corps '' to tackle refugee crisis an eu youth . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  ah yes , mr bliar . 
  a [ truly wonderful ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/8181392/tony-blair-eu-rebate-surrender-to-cost-billions-more-than-estimated.html ) european president . 
  was n't british nationalists that invaded poland now , was it ? 
  still waiting for the punishment budget and ww3 . 
  this is just like the imf admitting they ` made mistakes ' in their handling of the greek crisis . 
  too little , too late . 
  but then again , brussels is good at finding ways to manipulate the rules . 
  should kick luxembourg out for being a bunch of hypocrites about tax avoidance . 
  b-b-but the media told me it was brexit voters that hated eastern europeans !, 
  and if you google that today you 'll find that it 's been debunked . 
  iirc there was also a study that showed that there is no correlation between lack of intelligence and euroscepticism . 
  lol, 
  i take it you have n't seen the post referendum border polls then ? 
  lol , euro jingoism is dead . 
  this is just the beginning . 
  political and monetary union by stealth is n't exactly working . 
  i 'd give it 10 years before southern europe and/or france leave as well . 
  you do realise i do n't give two shits about things like ' # 350m for the nhs ' ? 
  continue dreaming about your delusional socialist euro-federalist utopia though . 
  i mean , [ what could go wrong ? 
  ah yes , the old ` everyone who voted leave must love farage ' meme . 
  i simply do n't believe it because he does n't meet the requirements to obtain citizenship . 
  as for lies - [ i 've got a bridge to sell you . 
  ] ( http://www.brugesgroup.com/media-centre/papers/8-papers/899-britain-and-europe-the-culture-of-deceit ), 
  and so [ the culture of deceit ] ( http://www.brugesgroup.com/media-centre/papers/8-papers/899-britain-and-europe-the-culture-of-deceit ) comes to an end . 
  cameron 's worthless renegotiation being the final nail in the coffin . 
  i wonder if he 'll end up as a un envoy , like blair . 
  perhaps he 'll be the ` un envoy on remaining in the eu ' . 
  and yet you have no proof that will confirm that they want an eu passport . 
  i do n't know , maybe it has something to do with the fact he has a german wife . 
  http://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/faqs/en/themen/migration/staatsang/erwerb_der_deutschen_staatsbuergerschaft_durch_eingbuergerung_en.html  spouses or registered same-sex partners of german citizens are eligible for naturalization after three years of legal residence in germany . 
  they must have been married or in a registered partnership for at least two years at the time of application . 
  the general requirements for naturalization also apply . 
  except they 're not eligible for german passports . 
  ah the old ` the people were so dumb that they did n't know what they were voting for ' meme . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maltese_european_union_membership_referendum,_2003 i 'm sure i can find more . 
  nobody gives two shits about ' # 350m for the nhs ' , there are plenty of other reasons to leave the eu . 
  amazing how one sided this sub is though - not one complaint about things like osborne 's punishment budget , fraudulent treasury figures etc. 
  i guess we 've gotten so used to [ the culture of deceit ] ( http://www.brugesgroup.com/media-centre/papers/8-papers/899-britain-and-europe-the-culture-of-deceit ) that few even care anymore . 
  [ intelligence agencies , you say ? 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/27/the-european-union-always-was-a-cia-project-as-brexiteers-discov/ ), 
  decades of [ lying and/or misrepresentation by politicians ] ( http://www.brugesgroup.com/media-centre/papers/8-papers/899-britain-and-europe-the-culture-of-deceit ) may have given the remain camp an edge . 
   ok , so the money that was supposedly `` send '' to the eu is n't going in to the nhs , the immigrants that are already in brittain can stay , and uk manufactures still have to follow eu regulations if they want to export there products . 
   f all the reason people wanted to leave the eu are no longer going to be inn acted ? 
  there 's a bit more to it than just 3 simple reasons . 
  well , i do n't think barbara castle would have appreciated an article that portrays the eu as an internationalist utopia and leave voters as jingoists . 
  joining the eec negatively affected multiple economies , including our own . 
  rejoining efta wo n't change much until we start signing additional fta 's . 
  d a n g e r o u s f a n t a s y a n g e r o u s f a n t a s y, 
  so i take it you 're mr ` death to traitors , freedom for the eu ' ? 
  3 months after the referendum and one side is still full of arrogant snobs . 
   i hope my government does eveything it can to attract those companies to dublin so i assume you 're in favour of them launching a legal challenge against the eu over their meddling in irish tax affairs ? 
   this is n't a good argument to an internationalist . 
  no , but [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/m5ks5tmnwcy?t=1h7m35s ) is , considering the eu seems to be widely regarded as some internationalist utopia . 
   one people , one state and one commision they 've somehow managed to rebrand european nationalism as ` european unity ' , and have sold it to the masses . 
  so , highlighting a trend about uninformed americans = hating americans ? 
  that 's really funny considering half this sub hates america for various reasons and wants to replace nato with an eu army . 
  and wanting an immigration policy that does n't favour europeans whilst discriminating against non-europeans is hardly xenophobic . 
  whereas sputnik still claim that the 2014 scottish independence referendum was rigged and have hired nats to work in their edinburgh office . 
   but hey , when the majority of voting age brits are xenophobes with a superiority complex lmao , let me guess , you 're yet another random american commenting on an issue they know fuck all about . 
  whenever i comment on foreign affairs , i at least do my homework . 
  one vote does n't go your way and it 's now somehow proof that ` the plebs do n't know what 's best for them but we do ' . 
  in that case , let 's just have a technocracy and do away with the extension of the franchise , not like there were still people campaigning for the right to vote only a century ago . 
   you just have to see the regrexits the day after the referundum , polling after the referendum has proved that the idea of widespread ` regrexit ' is complete bollocks . 
   you 've intentionally damaged our national interests pot , kettle : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1356047/euro-federalists-financed-by-us-spy-chiefs.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_committee_on_united_europe http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/27/the-european-union-always-was-a-cia-project-as-brexiteers-discov/ http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/people/aldrich/publications/oss_cia_united_europe_eec_eu.pdf http://campaignforanindependentbritain.org.uk/the-cia-agents-with-a-conscience/ https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/memo_pps23_by_george_kennan http://campaignforanindependentbritain.org.uk/deja-vu/ i suppose the cia owes an apology to [ new zealand  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_new_zealand#20th_century )  britain gained full membership of the eec on 1 january 1973 , and all trade agreements with new zealand came to an end , except the luxembourg agreement . 
  by the end of that year , only 26.8 % of new zealand 's exports were to britain . 
  this had a significant effect on the standard of living . 
  in 1953 , new zealand had the third highest standard in the world . 
  by 1978 , it had dropped to 22nd place . 
  not only that , but the electorate in 1975 were told by serial liars like ted heath , that if they leaved uk unemployment would reach 1 million .
