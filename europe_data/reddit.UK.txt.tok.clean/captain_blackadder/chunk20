  ted heath sold us out , maggie and benn simply realised this . 
   he literally held a `` rivers of blood '' speech https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enoch_powell#political_beliefs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1975#no_campaign_.28out_into_the_world.29 `` during an interview with the birmingham post , a fortnight after his rivers of blood speech , he was asked whether or not he was a racialist , he replied `` what i would take racialist to mean is a person who believes in the inherent inferiority of one race of mankind to another , and who acts and speaks in that belief . 
  so the answer to your question of whether i am a racialist is ` no ' - unless perhaps , in reverse . 
  i regard many of the peoples in india as being superior in many respects - intellectually for example , and in other respects - to europeans . 
  perhaps that is over-reacting . '' '', 
  educate yourself . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j-gb8pk2pk http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36367246 `` out campaigner tony benn claimed britain 's membership of the eec had cost 500,000 british jobs in just two years . 
  he blamed rising unemployment on the growing trade deficit between britain and the rest of the eec . 
  we were importing far more stuff from european countries than we were exporting to them . 
  ( britain has continued to run a trade deficit with the rest of the eu , and it hit a record high this year , thanks in part to a stronger pound . ) '', 
  this is why we ca n't have a sensible debate on immigration . 
  wanting fair controls on immigration is immediately labelled as racist . 
  what about all those post-ww2 migrants uncontrolled immigration effects , eh ? 
  do white middle class champagne socialists get to be the voice of migrants , those who have come here and contributed to our country ? 
  accusing all brexit supporters of racism is like accusing all muslims of supporting isis terrorism , or all irishmen of supporting the ira . 
  but that would be racist , would n't it ? 
  yes , actually . 
  i 'd rather we had a europe built on the principles of the eec we voted for in 1975 , not the protectionalist federalist undemocratic eu . 
   nationalistic populism , mostly lower class , and thats not their target market . 
  funny , i do n't think you 'd be labeling the anti-marketeers of 1975 as such . 
  dismissing evidence as scaremongering , are we ? 
   a far right troll party puts a bait i think you need a reminder of what the spanish pm 's official stance on gibraltar is . 
  you 're acting like the argentinians now . 
  accusing us of colonialism when you 're just as guilty of it . 
  they are essentially colonies , but on a smaller scale . 
  was french algeria/morocco not a colony ? 
   they have never belong to morocco . 
  ceuta was conquered by the portuguese , they also have a claim to it . 
  morocco is a berber successor state , i.e the heirs to the sultan who lost enclaves such as ceuta . 
  of course , if they were given a referendum on sovereignty , the largely ethnic spanish population would n't vote to join morocco - just as gibraltar does n't want to join spain . 
  the difference is we gave our dependencies a vote on national sovereignty , they are free to do as they please and are self-governing entities . 
  oh , and gibraltar has been an integral part of the uk since 1713 . 
   and remember to vote brexit gibraltarians do indeed have a vote in the referendum . 
  just remember that spain has enclaves in north africa , and no referendum on national sovereignty was offered to them . 
  bit hypocritical if you ask me . 
   at least she did n't hope the water would save her country from the dirty sand people and sit it out . 
  am i supposed to take you seriously ? 
  co-operating with neighbours of syria and sending them aid ( for refugee camps ) + providing boats for refugees ( so they do n't pay human traffickers ) + controlling migration effectively would have worked out far better than just opening the borders and letting everyone flood in . 
  you think they would show some respect for the fact we helped liberate them from napoleon , who had occupied almost the entirety of their country ( i.e what the far-right love ) , and also that the people of gibraltar wish to remain independent . 
  if scotland voted to go independent , as much as i would disagree with the decision , i would n't protest it . 
   we could surely help many more , for less per head , nearer to the area they 're fleeing/migrating from . 
  the countries surrounding syria seem even more reluctant than the eu to take in refugees . 
  gordon brown tried to do that and luckily we had the sense to kick him out . 
  sadly we 're still getting screwed over by it . 
  as a pro-leave supporter , i think vote leave should 've consulted with nissan for their opinion before publishing the leaflet . 
  protectionism is already weakening the european economy , and you want more ? 
  restricting trade between the eu instead of actually doing something about the poor economy of many of its members will just lead to an inevitable crash when the walls of protectionism come down . 
  `` italian minister claims credibility of eu as a `` reliable trade partner '' is at stake . '', 
   i have to respect whatever dumb shit the british people vote for . 
  in that sense it does n't . 
  right , [ because letting them all flow through germany ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-opens-its-gates-berlin-says-all-syrian-asylum-seekers-are-welcome-to-remain-as-britain-is-10470062.html ) had no effect on the rest of europe . 
  merkel could have handled the refugee crisis , far , far better than she did and the consequences will affect us akk . 
   i also think that if the uk leaves especially the uk is going to suffer and suffer in a major way and that 's just an reality you have to engage with . 
  i mean , why frame that differently ? 
  also , my ancestors were the nazis and i 'm strongly opposed to nation states and want nations to die . 
  yes , because a united states of europe would n't collapse and descend into infighting/conflict within decades . 
  we do n't hate europe , we dislike the eu . 
  even people like farage want to build some sort of free trade agreement with europe . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36367246 yes look at all those right wing anti eec nationalists you do realise that favouring eu migrants over non-eu migrants is xenophobic - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-s7a2wcyp8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=16m18s, 
  http://i.imgur.com/vibmbcp.jpg http://i.imgur.com/u055wuj.jpg http://www.worldpropertyjournal.com/news-assets/foreign%20investment%20in%20the%20uk.png https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j-gb8pk2pk if we left , we could champion internationalism whilst the eurozone begins to inevitably collapse . 
  a shining example of undemocratic eu integration . 
  just slowly and steadily hand over the powers to govern , do n't worry about it , everything 's fine . 
  sadly we decided to [ abandon internationalism in 1975 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j-gb8pk2pk ) , if not we 'd probably be able to do something similar , as we have a trade deficit with the eu , after all . 
   if britain leaves to see them begging to be let in in a few years as their economy crumbles while the remaining eu members sagely shake their heads and decide that this little upstart of a nation needs to realise it 's 2016 ( or whatever subsequent year it is ) , not 1922 . 
  and this sort of attitude is why we 're moving on to greener pastures . 
  we have a trade deficit with the eu - i think they need us more than we need them . 
   and settled in comfortable conditions ( by czech standards ) . 
  but this was n't good enough so the group rented a bus and escaped to germany , which automatically revoked their czech asylum . 
  this is saddening . 
  i do n't think even farage would consider that . 
  they 're really scraping the bottom of the barrel now . 
  oh look , the european trump is pro-remain . 
  it 's not even substantial eu reform , it 's whatever scraps he was offered by the real major powers in the eu . 
  the fact is they do n't think we ( and perhaps other countries down the line ) can go it alone , and they 're in for a surprise . 
  i can already see boris in no. 10 by the end of the year if we vote out . 
  we were sold an eec based upon the principles of free trade , and ended up becoming eu members instead . 
  as a result , we were forced to completely abandon existing trade deals with the commonwealth . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36367246 joining certainly did n't save the economy overnight . 
  `` we were importing far more stuff from european countries than we were exporting to them . 
  ( britain has continued to run a trade deficit with the rest of the eu , and it hit a record high this year , thanks in part to a stronger pound . ) '', 
  of course if we go , others could follow . 
  we can not negotiate our own trade deals . 
  the eu is n't exactly making much progress , as it still does n't have a trade deal with china , let alone the commonwealth - [ whom we abandoned in 1975 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j-gb8pk2pk ) http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36367246, 
  well , if we 're going to do this in chronological order , they implemented the janissary system before germany was even a state . 
  `` the country is divided , because `` the establishment '' has nurtured myths and lies about the eu boogeyman over decades '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j-gb8pk2pk those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . 
  but i guess the past is a myth . 
  nobody 's taken much notice of either . 
  then why do we only have a trade deficit with the eu , and no other trading blocs ? 
  why have iceland and switzerland been able to negotiate trade with china , and not the eu ? 
  why are greece and other eurozone states in such a poor condition ? 
  [ an abject , self-imposed humiliation awaits if this proud , important country does n't walk away . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j-gb8pk2pk ), 
   in the age of globalization , not even the uk gets to be an island which is exactly why we should n't restrict ourselves to a declining protectionist trade bloc that has still failed to negotiate a trade deal with china , despite iceland and switzerland obtaining deals years ago . 
  the eurozone will continue to decline , whereas we have a chance to get off this sinking ship and open ourselves up to trade with the wider world . 
  europe is the only continent that we have a trade deficit with , after all . 
  who knows , we might trigger further dismantlement . 
  what the hell is this neo nazi shit . 
  hurr durr brexit is a racist movement wanting to control migration is racist i hate this country all brexit supporters are stupid - a summary of your original post, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j-gb8pk2pk / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5ks5tmnwcy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9a1abfy-qw - particularly the free trade bit at the end and https://youtu.be/e9a1abfy-qw?t=9m30s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxpvqsnvwss probably a decent summary of why i want to go .
