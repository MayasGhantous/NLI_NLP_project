   who am i attacking personally ? 
  at least 40 % of the electorate . 
   you can only mock because you have no argument .

   aka we are a british and nhs and less immigrants = people will vote leave . 
  greco-roman/punic colonialism goes back even further . 
  that 's a discussion between the us and the eu , not nato . 
  i suppose they could try to use nato as a pressure group but i doubt it would work . 
   by giving up parts of your sovereignty , as always . 
  far less than we give up to the eu . 
   which makes it less democratic than your hated eu , really . 
  the us may occasionally attempt to use its influence to lobby for a certain cause ( e.g boycotting iran ) , but it does not dictate a significant amount of policy in any member state , because that it not its purpose . 
  switzerland also has a free trade agreement with china , one of the strongest economies at the moment , and yet the eu still has no agreement whatsoever . 
  please do tell me why iceland has been able to negotiate a trade deal with china , but the eu has not . 
  iceland has a trade deal with china - the eu does not . 
  eu protectionism and tariffs has lead to the decline of the eurozone as competition is discouraged . 
  regardless , the wto allows for countries to trade even if they are somehow unable to negotiate a trade deal . 
  the original eec , built upon free trade between europe , was a better idea . 
   how about they do n't give a shit and let you do that and get all the flack for it ? 
  we could just as easily deport them back to calais . 
  or , like civil people , we could negotiate with the french instead . 
   and yet plenty of offensive actions have been undertaken and plenty of times have nato decision been of a political nature . 
  like how the us made us all boycott iran and now russia ( not that i 100 % disagree with the decision but that 's how it went ) . 
  this is the same america that so strongly advocates its independence but wants us to remain in the eu due to ttip . 
  nato itself has problems , yes , but in terms of influencing policy , it is more limited in this regard . 
  it also safeguards the sovereignty of quite a few countries in the event of a military invasion , it 's not designed to be a parliament of any sort , it 's a military alliance . 
  the us also seems to have pressed on in syria , whereas nato has not . 
  our gdp growth is already greater than that of the eurozone , so no , it would n't surprise me at all . 
  and yet a politician recently claimed that we 'll be as insignificant as guernsey if we opt out of the eu . 
   and again this never had anything to do with lon , it was the decision of the nations themselves ( britain among them ) . 
  also lon is more comparable to the un than the eu . 
  these nations have unelected representatives within the european council . 
  you 're telling me they wo n't be able to use them to make decisions on eu proposals ? 
   ( let 's see how long france is going to oblige keeping unwanted immigrants in calais for you then ) how about they either start offering them asylum in france and/or start deporting them depending on the individual case . 
   nato being one of them ( or do you think the us played no role in sanctioning crimea ? 
  are you going to leave nato for that too ? ), 
  nato is a defensive alliance , a military treaty with both eu and non-eu members . 
  it is not a project of federal integration . 
   ` power must keep with the member states ! ', 
  to ` the eu is corrupt and ineffective because they keep squabbling ! ', 
   without any thought on those two things uh , how about leaving the eu and achieving self-governance again . 
  that certainly stops the squabbling ( there 's a lot less to argue about ) and power is once again returned to the member states . 
  regardless , we did n't actually vote the join the eu as a nation . 
  we voted to join the eec based upon the principles of free trade in 1975 . 
  there was no referedum on the lisbon treaty over here , despite this occurring in other countries . 
  the dutch i believe are now intending to block ukrainian membership of the eu via a referendum , which is probably for the best , as this would only give advocates for a european army ( juncker ) more credibility , when nato ( a defensive treaty , not an army that can be used offensively ) is already enough . 
  as for greece , germany was certainly the major player in enforcing debt reclamation , but it was the eu that vetoed the referendum . 
  the other member states could have supported the decision of the greek people . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/13/greece-bailout-eurozone-democracy-is-loser  that does n't even mean anything . 
  ` similar enemies ' ? 
  really ? 
  hitler and mussolini drove the league to breaking point because it could not agree on effective measures to combat them , and a disastrous policy of appeasement followed . 
  whilst i believe we 'll have to do business with putin and co in order to stop isis , this does n't mean we have to do stupid things like impose sanctions on the people of crimea , that only gives putin more support within russia as it simply makes life harder for the average crimean , not those who wish to annex it . 
  it 's been squabbling internally , like the lon for years . 
  heck , it 's even got similar `` enemies '' in putin and assad , and we all know how weak willed the eu is in regards to putin . 
  the lon also failed the recovering weimar government , just as the eu has failed the greeks . 
  please , do state how the eu is less corrupt when [ mr schulz threatened to overthrow the greek government and replace them with eu appointed technocrats if they did not give up on their referendum . 
  ] ( http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2015/07/04/ep-schulz-threatens-greeks-with-armageddon-can-we-sue-him-for-moral-damage-breach-of-public-office/ ) yes , europe never really promised us anything . 
  dave had to go and beg for vague assurances from mr hollande and mrs merkel instead . 
  of course , merkel did n't exactly help matters with her little uncontrolled migration experiment - it only made things worse for genuine refugees . 
  and how is scrapping the eu retarded ? 
  at this rate it 'll end up like the league of nations , a footnote in history , regardless . 
  dissolving it peacefully would be a preferable option , and perhaps we might eventually propose something else - like the eec we were promised in 1975 . 
  actual reform is n't possible due to corruption + vested interests , yes . 
  we 're in a economic union with eurozone members . 
  the icelandic pm makes similar comments on how they would not appreciate eu membership . 
  have you seen the state of the eurozone recently ? 
  let 's not forget that op compares the uk and norway . 
   in reality , brussels is dominated by governments who guard their power jealously . 
  and you 're implying that this is a better alternative ? 
  or we could not adopt the norwegian model . 
  and that 's their main argument - you 'll hate being like norway ( in the eea ) , when it 's likely we will eventually opt out of it . 
  pretty sure it already includes some non-eu members , such as norway . 
  nato predates the eu . 
  no , i did quite a bit of research before making my mind up thank you very much . 
  oh well , you 're now resorting to ad hominem attacks , how credible . 
  i trust the green party as much as i trust the bnp - not at all .

  the unelected bodies have final say , and have overruled the results of several referendums in the past - such as the referendum in greece , and referendums on the lisbon treaty . 
  mep 's do n't hold that much power within the eu . 
  and then people make a fuss and state they 'll leave the country because they did n't get what they wanted . 
  right - because france , italy , spain , portugal , finland and greece are having a wonderful time as eu members . 
  not like the greek public voted to leave or anything .

  uh no , how about presenting a largely positive case for staying in the eu . 
  the benefit of being able to negotiate our own trade deals ( and the fact that our trade with the rest of the world  our trade with the eu ) would outweigh any impact gates could have . 
  sure , finding recruits might be harder but the eu 's restrictive laws are a cause of unemployment ( e.g fishermen - http://www.cornishguardian.co.uk/looe-fisherman-slams-eu-quotas-spotting-french/story-28618220-detail/story.html ) .

  we have an independent central bank .

  `` so the time has come to deepen european integration instead of re-introducing national divisions . '', 
  `` eu is as corrupt as the soviet union '' .
