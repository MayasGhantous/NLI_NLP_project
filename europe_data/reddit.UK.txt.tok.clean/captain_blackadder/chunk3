  by 1980 it had reached 1.5 million . 
  and there 's the europhile ` only nationalists voted for brexit ' excuse yet again . 
   i hope that that brexit humbles britain so that when it rejoins the eu it will be fully committed to the project rather than keeping one foot out of the door . 
  85 % of the british public do not want the euro , good luck with that . 
  it wo n't be guy ` more europe is the answer to everything ' verhofstadt negotiating , it 'll be his [ lobbyist pals . 
  people like to pretend that the bbc is impartial but it 's really just full of blairites with an agenda . 
   it was something along the lines that the mps thought they we 're right and the population just too dumb to recognize that and to vote for them . 
  they 're still doing it now . 
  labour mp 's were on the bbc days after the referendum going on about ` how we did n't get our message out ' . 
  oh , they got their message out alright - but the voters rejected it . 
  it was the same with the general election last year . 
   perhaps you missed the fact that marxists , anarchists and socialists are supposed to be internationalists , that they believe national barriers should be broken down . 
   it was ludicrous seeing so called marxists , anarchists or just socialists backing the european union . 
  http://i.imgur.com/cc7dcc0.jpg on a more serious note , this was actually the campaign strategy for the in side back [ when labour were the eurosceptic party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1975 ) :  much of the `` yes '' campaign focused on the credentials of its opponents . 
  according to alastair mcalpine , `` the whole thrust of our campaign was to depict the anti-marketeers as unreliable people -- dangerous people who would lead you down the wrong path ... 
  it was n't so much that it was sensible to stay in , but that anybody who proposed that we came out was off their rocker or virtually marxist . 
  '' . tony benn controversially claimed : `` half a million jobs lost in britain and a huge increase in food prices as a direct result of our entry into the common market '' , using his position as industry minister as an authority . 
  his claims were ridiculed by the `` yes '' campaign and ministers ; the daily mirror labelled benn the `` minister of fear '' , and other newspapers were similarly derisive . 
  iirc they also claimed unemployment would reach 1 million if we left . 
  by the end of the decade it had reached 1.5 million . 
  thorpe even stated that leaving the eec was the only thing that had united the ira and the uvf . 
  [ i suppose tony would be proud . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxtvsquphmc ), 
  sturgeon should look at the polls . 
  iirc they 've even got a few ex-labour mp 's / staffers as columnists to balance things out, 
  of course bliar would be involved in corruption . 
  pretty sure we got rid of capital punishment in general in the sixties . 
  so we 've now got ` amid brexit ' for things that happened before the referendum that we want to portray as a result of it , ` despite brexit ' for good news after the referendum and ` because of brexit ' for any bad news even if it is n't directly linked to the referendum . 
  i see you 're still in the denial stage of grief . 
   ukip standards ~ 4 million people voted for ukip in 2015 17.4 million people from a variety of parties across the political spectrum voted to leave the eu . 
  bit of a shame that the only party willing to give the people a say on the eu are a bunch of far-right nutters . 
   murdoch funny thing is that ` le evil murdoch media empire ' was in favour of us remaining the last time we had a referendum on europe . 
  could say the same about your reaction to the brexit vote , it 's actually pretty hilarious . 
  i wonder what will happen if the us elects president drumpf . 
  replace ` scrap human rights act ' with ` tories want to leave the largely tory drafted echr and replace it with a tory drafted bill of rights ' , then you 've got the true story . 
   some people genuinely believe that we shall never get social justice from the british government , but we shall get it from jacques delors ; they believe that a good king is better than a bad parliament . 
  i have never taken that view . 
  do n't bother , it 's ` the tories this , the tories that ' with these types . 
  most political parties are n't perfect but at this point it 's just pure tribalism . 
  what a surprise , it 's a bunch of drunken chavs . 
   waiting for hitler to conquer poland so that he would face stalin 's soviet union . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact we were on our own after france fell and before operation barbarossa . 
   of course . 
  think of it like `` millions of rapists muslims who are fake refugees '' or `` millions of fake refugees who economic migrants and want to leech on our social services '' . 
  what a wonderful strawman !, 
  apparently boris johnson is now a ukip supporter . 
  nato handled the dissolution yugoslavia pre well , whereas the eu did n't . 
   aside from fringe groups and conservative nationalists , the majority of youths prefer to politically identify with a larger european community let 's wave the eu flag and sing the eu anthem and celebrate `` europe day '' to , erm , reject the pomp of nationalism ... oh . 
  well , he 's [ changed his tune over the years . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/feb/04/did-national-papers-pro-european-bias-in-1975-affect-the-referendum ), 
  ah yes , 17.4 million racist nationalist plebs . 
  it 's not internationalism it 's euro-jingoism . 
  well , as long as they jail the fuckers i could n't care where they end up . 
  the last time we had a referendum on europe was over 40 years ago . 
   the result should never have been accepted . 
  if brexit is ignored i predict there will be even bigger protests in london - people who have never voted before in their lives did so because they believed they could change something for the better . 
   you could equally say that the only way of exiting the eu with any hint of legitimacy is repeating the vote on the basis of a definite proposal for the basis on which we would leave . 
  until then , it 's just a one-off advisory referendum in which 37 % of registered voters supported an undefined `` leave '' . 
  in that case what was the plan in the even of a remain vote ? 
  what sort of reform would we get , given that it was promised ? 
  the ballot paper had two options on it - remain or leave , and the government promised to implement what the electorate decided in their # 9m leaflet sent to every household . 
  no , i 'm pretty sure it 's you taking the piss out of the poor since a large proportion of the working class voted to leave , and the arguments people make against overturning the vote are similar to the ones made against extending the franchise e.g the plebs are uneducated and do n't know what 's best for them, 
  oh no , the totally unbiased indy article from like a week after the vote . 
   stop one of the biggest mistakes the uk has recently made top kek, 
  right , so i guess we should n't have extended the franchise to the plebs in the 19th century then . 
   and now many regret it , because they just realized that they 'll all get fucked . 
  that 's a [ load of bollocks ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/08/11/yougov-focus-groups/ ) and you know it . 
   or we could accept this ghastly proposal , which is clumsy , secretive , centralized , bureaucratic and divisive . 
  that is how i regard the treaty of rome . 
  i was born a european and i will die one . 
  but i have never put my alliance behind the treaty of rome . 
  i object to it . 
  i hate being called an anti-european . 
  how can one be anti-european when one is born in europe ? 
  it is like saying that one is anti-british if one does not agree with the chancellor of the exchequer . 
  it 's hilarious how the same nutters who a couple of years ago were protesting against bankers bonuses are now protesting in favour of big banks . 
  so the evil kremlin did n't want us to leave the eu after all ? 
  another lie from the remain campaign unravels . 
  erdogan probably cares more about stopping the kurds than stopping isis . 
   nobody wants it to . 
  17.4 million people literally said otherwise . 
  who knows what could have happened had the molotov-ribbentrop pact not been signed , and if the allies had listened to those who said the wehrmacht would later roll through the ardennes . 
  we are , but some dipshits thought that leaving a politicial union gave them the right to attack poles and so the above user believes that 17.4 m people also now hate poles and want to start murdering them en masse because they voted to leave the eu . 
  is she human trash as well then , herr imakelotsofaltstoavoidbans, 
   fascist brexit land . 
  comedy gold i tell you , comedy gold, 
  ira : bombed civilians and proud, 
  bahahahahahahahahahahahaha this is comedy gold, 
  bahahahahahahahahaha, 
   quite funny how sad british left/progressives are about this whole thing . 
  sad thing is last time we had a referendum we had people on the left like tony benn , peter shore and barbara castle in favour of leaving . 
  fyi this guy is an ira supporting nutter who now pretends to british but is actually an irishman living in canada , who uses alts to avoid bans .

  ok , so let me get this straight . 
  a supposedly xenophobic campaign is responsible for a white nationalist murdering an mp , but if farage were to be murdered it 's fine because all the people sending him death threats after the referendum was just banter , rather than inciting others to murder a politician . 
  so much for kinder , gentler politics . 
  ok , so countless [ online death threats ] ( https://twitter.com/thatcherite4/status/747891922287591425?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw ) in the wake of the referendum that led to [ his resignation ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/death-threats-strain-family-preceded-resignation-nigel-farage-say-ukip-insiders-1568891 ) mean nothing and could n't at all be said to be inciting the murder of a politician . 
   our side do n't do that http://order-order.com/2016/06/29/telegraph-journalist-goads/ http://imgur.com/a/2xjac http://imgur.com/a/p4czm, 
  starting to sound like a parody account . 
  where 's the evidence that the cunt who murdered jo cox explicitly did so because she was a remain politician , rather than because he was a white nationalist and therefore would oppose her stance on syrian refugees .
