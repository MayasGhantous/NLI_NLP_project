  i 'm also waiting for the evidence that 17.4 m people are foaming at the mouth racists . 
  ah well , it 'll be fun watching one of your alts having a mental breakdown when we trigger article 50 . 
  hollande 's policies are going to make this an impossibility . 
  she 's had to say it because a minority of delusional fools keep begging for a 2nd referendum . 
  and the express has been in mourning ever since . 
  http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=86148 has some additional details, 
  so they 've no problem sponsoring european integration as a weapon against the ussr and then putin 's tyranny until it harms their own interests . 
  the same murdoch that was originally [ in favour of the eec . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/feb/04/did-national-papers-pro-european-bias-in-1975-affect-the-referendum ), 
  so the same people that have supported european integration for decades are now complaining about tax harmonisation . 
  it 's almost as if they 've realised that they have created a monster . 
  they wo n't listen . 
  might not be able to do that if the commission goes after your corporation tax scheme . 
  got anything better to do than post every single negative story about brexit ? 
  did we really trigger the euronationalists that hard ? 
   but then you implied i supported the ira it 's a shame your main is banned , it really was a goldmine for disgusting quotes . 
   which is obviously a logical problem . 
  if the murder and terrorisation of irish citizens of the united kingdom did n't matter because it happened last century , sure , if individuals on both sides are going to be prosecuted , i 'd want a chilcot style report so that justice is achieved for everyone . 
  do n't remember ever stating i supported terrorism in any form , and if i remember correctly there would have been a peaceful resolution had the militant hardline unionists not removed the moderate unionists from office . 
  why should that matter when you openly support their murders . 
  i guess those civilians should have leapt and cheered whilst they carried out their reign of terror . 
   right , right , and when where the ira active again ? 
  why should that matter when you openly support their murders . 
  i guess those civilians should have leapt and cheered whilst the carried out their reign of terror . 
   should just shut up and get on with being attacked !, 
  er , no - they should report the racist scumbags to the police , which is what any sane person would advocate . 
  newsflash , it 's the 21st century and you 're talking about the irish struggle whilst living in canada . 
   and the poles should leap and cheer that attacks against them and their homes have what is this i do n't even ... 
  so when are we going to gas the untermens ... 
  i mean human scum , herr theflashyfinger ? 
   and the ousting of poles from england !, 
  and once we 've deported them all , we 're going to build a wall and make them pay for it !, 
  edit = i bet you 'll stupidly think i 'm serious, 
  oh you 've persuaded me , i feel so sorry for you . 
  whatever can i do to lessen my white male english privilege and become friends with those who wish to aid the struggle of the irish people against the evil english oppression of today carried out by my fellow citizens . 
  amazing logic . 
  `` rich kids from essex '', 
   oh snap , was that done by remain supporters during the remain campaign or directly after it ? 
  you know , just like brexit supporters shot jo cox dead in the street in broad daylight , or burned down polish family 's property and told them to get out ? 
  you know , i think jo cox 's family would be disgusted that you continue to use her death in such a divisive way . 
  it 's despicable , considering she wanted to unite people , rather than divide them .

   i 'm sorry i 'm typing this while giggling . 
  i 'm just picturing a guy absolutely terrified of saying english nationalism instead of british nationalism because he 's aware of the problems of saying that . 
  go wave your cross of st george , little guy . 
  muh evil oppressive genocidal english nationalist brexit kremlin conspiracy, 
  yeah , if your main was n't suspended i 'd have countless quotes of you spewing xenophobic bollocks on hand . 
   yes , ** our supporters murdered a female mp ** in broad daylight days before the referendum . 
   yes , we still ** supported him and voted for his policies . 
  ** ok this basically confirms you 're a disgusting individual . 
  apparently 17.4 million people are now neo-nazis . 
   tell you what rich kid from essex , yeah , ok mr ` you 're a bigot but i like to spew anti-english bile ', 
   i mean for a brexit bigot from essex i would n't expect you to care . 
  i 'm sure you 're terrified about meeting someone with a funny accent in case they accidentally give you a case of the vapours and you 're forced to leech yourself again . 
  bahahahahahahahahaha ok keep telling yourself that i somehow hate foreigners and that we 're all responsible for racist scumbags being violent racist scumbags , whilst idolising a group that murdered innocent civilians in cold blood on a regular basis . 
  hypocrisy at its finest . 
  no , i find it hilarious that you 're trying to masquerade as a self-hating brit one on of your alts by posting :  jesus fucking christ , the sickening air from brexit still hangs over us . 
  it 's the same thing putin 's bots do - pretend to be americans voting for trump whilst spreading disinformation . 
  2 alts 1 thread , lmao, 
  oh do grow up you pathetic little child . 
   just because they dared to criticize mass migration does not mean they are racists . 
  there 's a huge difference between being a racist white supremacist scumbag and wanting some control over immigration . 
   yes we murdered female politicians in the street , ok , then because the remain campaign failed to distance themselves from people like tony blair , alastair campbell and martin mcguinness , they 're now responsible for the deaths of dr david kelly and the innocents who died in iraq , ireland and the uk . 
  surely , being such an expert , you should realise that hitler was also in favour of a united europe . 
   hard evidence which is already coming undone given the data that has been released after the vote . 
   recently mount a campaign wedded to populism and xenophobia promising to boot out all of those nasty immigrants and pump all that money going to johnny belgian back into the muslim health service i honestly ca n't tell if you 're delusional or just trolling . 
   my political views are supported by nazis oswald mosley was in favour of a united europe . 
   and you are going to be tarred with that brush for the rest of your life . 
  says the ira supporting nutjob . 
  let me guess , / u/theworldcrimeleague is back on another alt . 
  where 's your irish flair ? 
  you are aware that vote leave blocked le pen from entering the country , right ? 
  muh united states of europe !, 
  muh greek austerity !, 
  muh german hegemony !, 
  muh irish taxes !, 
  i hear nigel farage is looking for a new job . 
  edit : nevermind , looks like you 've already got an [ anti-eu mep ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luke_%27ming%27_flanagan ), 
  articles like this remind me of why i admired tony benn , even if he was on the opposite side of the political spectrum :  if people lose the power to sack their government one of several things happens . 
  first , people may just slope off . 
  apathy could destroy democracy . 
  when the turnout drops below 50 per cent , we are in danger ... the second thing that people can do is to riot . 
  riot is an old-fashioned method for drawing the attention of the government to what is wrong . 
  it is difficult for an elected person to admit it , but the riot at strangeways produced some prison reforms . 
  riot has historically played a much larger part in british politics than we are ever allowed to know . 
  thirdly , nationalism can arise . 
  instead of blaming the treaty of rome , people say , ` it is those germans ' or ` it is the french ' . 
  nationalism is built out of frustration that people feel when they ** can not get their way through the ballot box . 
  ** with nationalism comes repression . 
   i hope that it is not pessimistic -- in my view it is not -- to say that democracy hangs by a thread in every country of the world . 
  unless we can offer people a peaceful route to the resolution of injustices through the ballot box they will not listen to a house that has blocked off that route . 
  sounds like tony benn 's [ ` commonwealth of europe ' that he proposed all the way back in 1991 . 
  ] ( https://whitewednesday.wordpress.com/2015/06/05/tony-benn-on-democracy-and-the-eu-20th-november-1991/ ) funnily enough , farage was heavily criticised for saying something very similar to this specific part of his speech :  if people lose the power to sack their government one of several things happens . 
  first , people may just slope off . 
  apathy could destroy democracy . 
  when the turnout drops below 50 per cent , we are in danger ... the second thing that people can do is to riot .
