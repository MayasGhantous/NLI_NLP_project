  instead of blaming the treaty of rome , people say , ` it is those germans ' or ` it is the french ' . 
  nationalism is built out of frustration that people feel when they can not get their way through the ballot box . 
  with nationalism comes repression . 
   i hope that it is not pessimistic -- in my view it is not -- to say that democracy hangs by a thread in every country of the world . 
  unless we can offer people a peaceful route to the resolution of injustices through the ballot box they will not listen to a house that has blocked off that route . 
  whereas farage said :  it 's legitimate to say that if people feel they 've lost control completely , and we have lost control of our borders completely as members of the eu , and if people feel voting does n't change anything , then violence is the next step . 
  comrade putin did nothing wrong . 
  euronat hive mind assemble !, 
  it 's time to post articles about how britain is racist and evil and isolationist and uneducated and about how the eu is the best thing since sliced bread . 
   mostly at the pledge of a guy who said ' i do n't want to have romanian neighbours ' . 
  ukip votes at the last general election = approx 4 million leave votes in the referendum = 17.4 million ukip voters are n't the only eurosceptics in britain . 
  bahahahahahaha, 
  i would n't call farage far-right , i think the only reason he showed up at that trump rally was a promise of $ $ $ from breitbart . 
  the guy used to support rand paul and thought trump was ` too extreme ' . 
  you 'll never guess which scottish party hat the highest proportion of leave votes in scotland . 
  it was n't a pro-union party . 
  we were the first western nation to abolish slavery . 
  nick clegg 's dangerous fantasy is back in the news yet again . 
  when will people learn that politicians who oppose uncontrolled immigration do not oppose immigration itself . 
  you can be anti-uncontrolled immigration without being anti-immigrant . 
  do you honestly think that farage is the only politician that wants to leave the eu ? 
  so the same snp that predicted oil revenues would now be # 8 billion ( actual figure is # 60 million ) are now saying that brussels will ignore a # 14.8 bn deficit . 
  i suppose they also believe that they wo n't have to join the euro . 
   the landfill dwelling gipsy , sounds like something [ your government ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/corruption-roma-discrimination-widespread-problems-in-romania/ ) would say . 
  i suppose if we did one for the left the ussr/china , the ira , cuba , venezuela etc would be allies and the us/row would be greedy imperialist capitalist dogs . 
  i do n't blame ireland , i blame the ira and the hardline unionists who did n't want peace . 
  tell that to the families of the dead civilians , then . 
  i dare you . 
  at least we got rid of our empire . 
  europe is busy creating a new one . 
  bahahahaha , so all the european nationalists stroking their egos over the ` eu has the most medals because they still compete as 28 states rather than one ' are now butthurt over some retaliatory humour from [ euro guido ] ( http://order-order.com/2016/08/22/empire-would-beat-eu/ ) . 
  oh dear , unlike the european parliament , these people are n't serious . 
  and , i might add that we have a history of defeating continental empire builders . 
  ah , the acceptable face of european nationalism . 
   echr was actually heavily inspired by british law on human rights . 
  it was actually largely drafted by a british tory mp in the first place . 
  ah , more quality journalism from that clickbait site known as the independent . 
  i suppose sweden will also be warning ireland about low corporate taxes , which [ will fall on deaf ears .

  if they moved the border , even more migrants would come to calais as it would be even easier to reach the uk . 
  pritchard is n't the only one reporting on/providing evidence for this : https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/people/aldrich/publications/oss_cia_united_europe_eec_eu.pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_committee_on_united_europe https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/memo_pps23_by_george_kennan http://www.voltairenet.org/article184422.html#nb3 - french journalist who also appears to have a [ copy of the memo from 1965 . 
  these people still think russia is a communist paradise for some reason . 
  if anything american foreign policy has been to encourage european integration , ever since they started funding federalists through cia fronts in the fifties . 
  corbyn is haemorraghing votes to other parties , and the only party he might actually gain votes from would be the greens or the swp ( both minor parties ) . 
  he 's like a 21st century michael foot . 
  if anything we 'd probably be able to give nato more clout being outside the eu , without the interference of groups like eurocorps . 
  i wonder how the trump = bad , corbyn = good people are going to spin this one , considering they appear to be taking similar stances in regards to standing up for nato allies . 
  but of course , it 's only america that 's interested in regime change . 
  the falkland islands were uninhabited before european colonists arrived there . 
  we do n't ? 
  well , if people stopped encouraging them to come via human traffickers and instead funded/took actual refugees from the camps in the middle east , there would be less of them , and so there would be less of a strain on countries like greece , so they would then be able to provide better welfare services . 
  even [ timmermans ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/six-out-of-10-migrants-to-europe-come-for-economic-reasons-and-are-not-refugees-eu-vice-president-a6836306.html ) suggested that quite a few of the migrants are there for economic reasons .

  exactly , we may see some economic benefits ( as well as a decline in wages for low paid jobs + stress on services etc ) , but it the rate at which immigration is happening weakens eastern europe economically . 
  freedom of movement only works between countries with similar gdp 's . 
  he would have needed to have lived in germany for 3 years to claim citizenship . 
  `` we are discussing whether the british people are to be allowed to elect those who make the laws under which they are governed . 
  the argument is nothing to do with whether we should get more maternity leave from madame papandreou '' - tony benn, 
  pretty strange that german politicians are talking about cherry-picking when they 're not spending their 2 % of gdp on defence to meet nato requirements . 
  how 's that banking crisis working out for you ? 
  nah , they prefer to use technocrats like renzi , [ dubious measures in portugal ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11949701/aep-eurozone-crosses-rubicon-as-portugals-anti-euro-left-banned-from-power.html ) or in the case of greece , excessive austerity . 
  funding far right pro-eu demonstrations in ukraine did n't help either , as it just gave putin an excuse to illegally annex crimea . 
  http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/03/meet-the-british-poles-who-back-brexit/  ` the eu reminds me of a totalitarian state , like poland was when i left , ' she says . 
  ` like the soviet union , the eu is pushing for complete conformity and unity which i find uncomfortable . 
  brussels is propagating a destruction of national pride . ', 
  leave.eu were also posting trump videos before the vote . 
  i think they may have actually lost voters rather than gained voters . 
  `` the most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of western european leaders to re-create the soviet union in western europe . '' -- mikhail gorbachev, 
  considering that one of [ the couples ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-37106914 ) invited [ supports the snp ] ( http://imgur.com/szwrf9c ) , it would n't surprise me if this was stage managed to get eu migrants to support independence . 
  especially as it seems the only reason [ sturgeon ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/australian-brain-family-told-to-leave-scotland-1-4193022 ) supported the brain family was because they were [ indy activists . 
  and i suppose russia would be doing better if it reformed the soviet union ? 
   at least us swedes are n't racist and intolerant . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/14/sweden-democrats-flex-muscles-anti-immigrant-kristianstad  here in sweden we celebrate diversity and welcome refugees . 
  yes because encouraging them to come into europe via human traffickers is a much better way of accepting refugees than funding camps in the middle east and taking refugees from said camps . 
   most voters are idiots so much for universal suffrage .

  soros v murdoch - the propaganda battle of the 21st century . 
  there was also an american sprinter called english . 
  it 's probably the party membership figure ( before it was made compulsory ) , rather than the amount of people voting for them . 
   merkel and ask if she has some more former stasi agents well , she might [ know a thing or two about stasi agents .

  merkel , barroso and mogherini are all former marxists . 
  iirc merkel also had links to the east german regime . 
  the lottery funding from post-96 ( where we won 1 gold ) has probably had more of an effect imo . 
  except they 've been doing the exact opposite for over 50 years . 
  only fringe elements like john kornblum have realised that the eu has become ideologically detached from nato . 
  the eu was originally an american led and funded project . 
  us foreign policy has been to promote eu integration and for us to be in the eu since the fifties . 
  the cia provided funding for fronts like the american committee on a united europe . 
   the us government has been pro eu so pro-eu that they ended up [ getting the cia involved .
