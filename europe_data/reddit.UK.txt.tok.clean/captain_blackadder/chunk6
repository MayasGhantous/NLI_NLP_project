  us foreign policy has been to push for european integration/uk involvement in the eu since the fifties . 
  american intelligence has been interfering in europe since the 1950 's . 
  this hardly surprises me . 
  the eu was largely funded and supported by the us until the 1980 's . 
  yet more virtue signalling misinformation by the media . 
  boris hates trump and farage is a civic nationialist , not a blood and soil one . 
   anyway , i think his point was that farage is human trash , just like trump , which is obviously true . 
  so when are we gassing the untermensch , herr whitepalms ? 
  you do realise that if farage had n't created ukip it would be the bnp collecting those sorts of votes , and they 're actual racists . 
  well , it was originally an american led and funded project . 
   first norway announces it 's going to look after itself . 
  now denmark . 
  uk starts to realize nobody is on its side anymore . 
  except switzerland and iceland have expressed an interest in co-operation , and if you 'd read the article it was just the europhile norwegian government expressing concerns about re-entry into efta/eea . 
  we 'd certainly be able to give that organisation some more clout . 
  pretty shit joke if it even is one . 
  i was comparing the eu referendum to the scottish independence referendum . 
  try reading what i wrote again . 
  loads of xenophobic twats in the comments . 
  i wonder if we 're going to get a new legal challenge every other week until we leave . 
  i doubt the snp would have to put up with this if the scots had voted for independence . 
   the acts of union were two acts of parliament : the union with scotland act 1706 passed by the parliament of england , ** and the union with england act passed in 1707 by the parliament of scotland . 
  ** they put into effect the terms of the treaty of union that had been agreed on 22 july 1706 , following ** negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries . 
  ** by the two acts , the kingdom of england and the kingdom of scotland -- which at the time were separate states with separate legislatures , but with the same monarch -- were , in the words of the treaty , `` united into one kingdom by the name of great britain '' . 
   the two countries had shared a monarch since the union of the crowns in 1603 , when king james vi of scotland inherited the english throne from his double first cousin twice removed , queen elizabeth i. 
  although described as a union of crowns , until 1707 there were in fact two separate crowns resting on the same head ( as opposed to the implied creation of a single crown and a single kingdom , exemplified by the later kingdom of great britain ) . 
  there had been three attempts in 1606 , 1667 , and 1689 to unite the two countries by acts of parliament , but it was not until the early 18th century that ** both political establishments came to support the idea ** , albeit for different reasons . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acts_of_union_1707  the acts of union were two acts of parliament : the union with scotland act 1706 passed by the parliament of england , and the union with england act passed in 1707 by the parliament of scotland . 
   the english are responsible , as the british empire came about by conquest by the english and was dominated by the english and continues to be so . 
  in fact it 's dominance was so total that england was often used as a word for the whole island and , latterly , the whole kingdom and empire . 
  this is not a fellowship of equals , or even one of consent . 
  the union was first proclaimed by a scottish monarch , and the act of union was also overseen by another monarch of the same dynastic line . 
  you ca n't claim that england was responsible for that one . 
  american influence : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_committee_on_united_europe http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1356047/euro-federalists-financed-by-us-spy-chiefs.html https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/people/aldrich/publications/oss_cia_united_europe_eec_eu.pdf https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/memo_pps23_by_george_kennan https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/26/robert-mundell-evil-genius-euro warnings to heath/wilson : https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acft/fco+30+1048.pdf - fco 30/1048 http://campaignforanindependentbritain.org.uk/research-paper-1079-letter-edward-heath-lord-kilmuir-december-1960/ http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/11057170/how-harold-wilson-was-warned-europe-threatened-british-democracy.html, 
   so a united europe leaves no room for conflict within european borders . 
  oh , we know [ exactly how it came to be alright . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/27/the-european-union-always-was-a-cia-project-as-brexiteers-discov/ ), 
  oh god , here comes another remoaner who claims that brexit voters are english nationalists . 
   ah the sound of a brexit voter realizing the world is n't the english nationalistic fairytale he wanted it to be . 
  yes , because the eu is obviously some beacon of internationalism . 
  lmao, 
   it seems we share culture and history when it 's convenient for english populists to say so . 
  as opposed to scottish nationalists rejecting the idea that their nation played a major role in the empire ? 
  the polls show scotland does n't want independence . 
  stop me if i 'm going to fast for you . 
  i was n't aware that euroscepticsm was a synonym for populism . 
   article 50 was going to be signed the day after the vote . 
  it was n't . 
  it was cameron who promised that , actually . 
  he also promised not to resign . 
  people love to go on about how murdoch controls the media ( which he does ) whilst ignoring the amount of power soros wields . 
  35 % of snp voters , 38 % of the electorate iirc, 
  [ i wonder why that might be the case . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/27/the-european-union-always-was-a-cia-project-as-brexiteers-discov/ ), 
  yes , it 's clearly just one poster doing it . 
   we ca n't let a small minority hold the rest of the country hostage . 
  the last time someone in power held those views , ni went through a period known as ` the troubles ' . 
   yes try and equivocate people who your state caged in the streets of belfast for the crime of being catholic , so all the catholics/republicans we killed were ira members , were they ? 
  i do n't go around proclaiming my support for the disgusting atrocities the army/loyalist paramilitaries carried out over there , but some on this sub love to glorify the terrorists on the republican side . 
  it was a scottish king who created the union , after all . 
  was n't just norman england that invaded , the anglo-saxons and the vikings also had a go at it . 
  and it would have been much harder had the various duchies and/or the picts not been squabbling with each other over tracts of land . 
  so bombing innocent civilians in london is acceptable ? 
  do you also support isis because we invaded iraq and killed muslims ? 
  pretty sure we beat them 2-3 in berlin a couple of months ago . 
  french protectionism truly is a work of art . 
   erdogan is also convinced that this was organized by the west so there must be some evidence . 
  so , you trust erdogan then ? 
  your comprehension skills are clearly lacking if that 's what you took away from what i wrote . 
  american foreign policy has pushed for eu integration ever since the cia set up fronts to finance euro-federalists in the fifties as a response to the establishment of the comintern . 
  luckily , some american politicians such as john kornblum have realised that it has since ideologically detached itself from nato and is a dysfunctional mess . 
  48 % is under half the country . 
  opposition to the euro is even greater over here than opposition to the eu . 
   even though legal experts said it was probably in violation of our constitution . 
  it 's a shame ted heath is no longer around , he could have given them some advice on how to violate constitutions . 
  that would imply that there are only bigots on one side of the debate . 
  but ... but ... but ... all i do is shitpost about trump and brexit, 
  unlike the majority of norwegians , their government have always been europhiles . 
  except you can make a cornish pasty in cornwall with ingredients from around the world , and it 's protected . 
  but if you make a cornish pasty in devon with cornish ingredients , it 's not . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/8340861/cornish-pasty-given-eu-protected-status.html `` one devonian manufacturer , who did not want to be named , said eu bureaucrats could `` go to hell '' . '', 
   the potential loss of preferential trade with europe has left wales rushing to export its lamb and beef to the united states this has been planned for a while . 
   many people in rural britain , including wales , are against the eu because the open borders required by membership challenges their sense of national identity . 
  i wonder if this is subtle way of calling them racist . 
  both iceland and switzerland seemed to welcome efta expansion , as the organisation would gain influence . 
  cronyism , ladies and gentlemen . 
  punishment budget that never would have gone through the commons that promised spending cuts ( borrowing has actually increased ) , misleading treasury figures about the ` cost of brexit ' , stating that eea membership = pay but no say , claiming that there would be a stock market crash , giving the impression that the eu is responsible for our environmental policy , claiming that we 'd see militarisation of the irish border , claiming that the calais border would move , stating that disabled people would be disadvantaged if we left ( our laws covering this area adhere to un regulations , not the eu ) , claiming that putin supported brexit ( which is funny because the americans funded the early eec through cia fronts in response to the establishment of the comintern yet most us politicians have failed to realise that the eu is ideologically detaching itself from nato ) amongst other things . 
  brown was blair v2 , and was n't actually elected . 
  as for thatcher : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/1460780/thatchers-bruges-vision-becomes-reality-as-eastern-bloc-returns.html `` i am now unpersuaded by the case for further eu expansion , '' she wrote in statecraft , a book published in 2002 as part of her autobiographical series . '', 
  `` she urged applicant countries to abandon the quest for membership and said britain should renegotiate its relationship with the eu or withdraw if necessary . '', 
   too bad if they had a policy you did n't like , vote for someone else next time . 
  so we 're going to elect politicians based on a single policy now ? 
   so annoyed it was the main country that pushed expansion of former soviet states , pushed the 2004 expansion and pushed turkey 's membership . 
   and unlike other states , did n't do anything to stop immigration in 2004 like practically every other eu country did . 
  so blair ( who wanted cheap labour ) and cameron ( most likely lobbied ) = the whole country ? 
  both campaigns told lies . 
  yet our politicians have lied to us about europe since the fifties . 
   have you already conveniently forgotten the `` 350 million to nhs '' lie ? 
  what about `` we 're tired of the experts '' ? 
  there were an endless stream of lies that the brexit camp pumped out and its downright silly to sweep that under the carpet and play the victim of the bullies in r/europe .
