  and yet remain lies were conveniently ignored . 
   you know something really is n't going well when it 's the americans who are the ones talking sense . 
  well , considering as the early eec was largely an american project , the early european movement was funded by fronts for the cia in response to the establishment of the comintern and their foreign policy has been to push for more integration ( despite the eu increasingly ideologically detaching itself from nato ) , they may well have a vested interest in this . 
  i was n't aware that euroscepticsm was as synonym for populism . 
  they had a chance to persuade me to change my voting intentions , and they did n't . 
  but do continue to bleat on about how leave voters voted for an `` evil , populistic racist nationalist '' campaign ( which implies that vote leave were the only group involved yet i 've proved this to not be the case to you multiple times ) , rather than simply to leave the eu . 
  it 's almost as if you believe that 17.4 m people are drooling morons who just wanted # 350m a week for the nhs . 
  then again , i guess an irish nationalist would know what populistic nationalism is like , since sinn fein is essentially a left-wing ukip with gerry adams as the anti-establishment figure . 
  they did share a platform over lisbon , after all . 
  my mind was made up well before the campaigning started . 
  says the person who claimed i voted for a particular campaign , lmao . 
  [ where 's the option to elect vote leave ( one of many leave groups ) to form a government ? 
  austria threatened to use its veto in 2005 . 
  it did n't work . 
   it 's a shame though that it would be a set of countries united against something instead of for something . 
  well , that 's what the eu was originally supposed to be - a united force against the comintern . 
  it 's why the cia funded the early european movement . 
  and the thick moron still ca n't get it into his head that we did n't elect vote leave . 
  yes , do continue to delude yourself that this was a vote for isolationism , deporting foreigners , re-opening the mines etc it 's laughable , really . 
  still waiting for the apocalypse . 
  meanwhile the rest of europe can enjoy being a part of a project set up with cia funds in response to the establishment of the comintern , that eventually got so out of hand that a former state department chief of european affairs commented that `` in the areas of military , security and defence , it is totally dysfunctional . '', 
  they can enjoy becoming part of the reconstruction of the soviet union in western europe by western politicians . 
  the only disaster on this continent is the organisation we were pushed into by stealth , and went on to impose countless disasters upon the peoples of europe . 
  it 's almost amusing to think of eu bureaucrats attempting to block financial traffic to britain across networks routed through singapore or possibly tel aviv , as they continually isolate themselves from the rest of the world through `` fortress europe '' style protectionism . 
  we 'll be the ones laughing . 
  [ sounds familiar  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1975#the_campaign.2c_funding_and_media_support )  the `` yes '' campaign enjoyed much more funding , thanks to the support of many british businesses and the confederation of british industry . 
  according to the treasurer of the `` yes '' campaign , alastair mcalpine , `` the banks and big industrial companies put in very large sums of money '' . 
  at the time , business was `` overwhelmingly pro-european '' , and harold wilson met several prominent industrialists to elicit support . 
  it was common for pro-europeans to convene across party and ideological lines with businessmen . 
  john mills , the national agent of the `` no '' campaign , recalled : `` we were operating on a shoe-string compared to the rolls royce operation on the other side '' . 
  however , it was also the case that many civil society groups supported the `` yes '' campaign , including the national farmers union and some trade unions . 
   much of the `` yes '' campaign focused on the credentials of its opponents . 
  according to alastair mcalpine , `` the whole thrust of our campaign was to depict the anti-marketeers as unreliable people -- dangerous people who would lead you down the wrong path ... 
  it was n't so much that it was sensible to stay in , but that anybody who proposed that we came out was off their rocker or virtually marxist . 
  as opposed to the cia funding the european movement in response to the establishment of the comintern , government figures lying and suppressing information in order for us to join , and a slow and continual erosion of powers to brussels over 40 years , which some had warned about ? 
  cameron said he would n't resign if we voted to leave , and yet he did anyway . 
  hah , the slavic tribes were in the steppes at the time of alexander . 
  they did n't settle in the balkans until around the fall of the wre . 
  bunch of morons . 
   now short term contracts will be the norm and workers rights will begin to vanish . 
  if i wanted incoherent hysterical doom-mongering , i 'd read the independent . 
  well , the early eec was [ an ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/memo_pps23_by_george_kennan ) [ american project ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/27/the-european-union-always-was-a-cia-project-as-brexiteers-discov/ ) , so who knows . 
  `` the most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of western european leaders to re-create the soviet union in western europe . '' -- mikhail gorbachev, 
   the whole world is laughing at you for what you 've done , even the american political shows . 
  and we 'll have the last laugh when overnight experts on british politics are proven wrong . 
  the snp love to blame the tories in order to cover up their own failures , yet they get away with it . 
   so , there is no scenario in which the uk can be economically better off outside the eu than within it , short of the eu itself being destroyed . 
  period . 
  which is not a `` no pay , no say '' agreement like some would have you believe . 
   if britain will stay in the eu and continue on the base of the eu 's rather sensible economic and social policies , or if these policies will be replaced by an arbitrary populist legislation from brain-dead local xenophobes and provincialists soon . 
  sensible economic policies from the eu ? 
  lmao,

   london voted to remain , 40.1 % of london voted to leave . 
  i highly doubt 40.1 % of london is entirely made up of ` little englanders ' .

  since i 've been living in central europe , i 've seen first hand the sociological scars of soviet rule . 
  i 've listened to older folk , who despite the `` allure '' of always having a job , strange , because some [ poles ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/03/meet-the-british-poles-who-back-brexit/ ) disagree with your opinion . 
  and so did gorbachev , who said `` the most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of western european leaders to re-create the soviet union in western europe . '', 
  french protectionism in a nutshell . 
  seems odd to me . 
  * austrian chancellor wants to appease fpo voters although afaik austria did attempt to veto the talks in 2005 . 
   the legendary little englander fear/contempt of foreigners really runs deep with you does n't it . 
  it 's almost as if you have n't read a word of what i 've written . 
  no , those who voted to leave have learnt to see beyond the protectionist ` fortress europe ' . 
  out , and into the world . 
  from the guardian 's liveblog : http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/05/brexit-live-tory-leadership-tom-watson-unions-jeremy-corbyn?page=with:block-577b679ce4b0243071e32cca#block-577b679ce4b0243071e32cca, 
   you made your xenophobic bed , but do n't expect the rest of us to lie in it . 
  we 'll adapt , the same as those brave souls who went to live in the uk to work , for their futures , and have now been backstabbed . 
  the eu is n't just about politics and economy , it 's about building shared communities with common principles as well . 
  so , as a european briton who 's travelled the world , and escaped the xenophobia years ago , you 're full of shit . 
  you voted precisely to punish all those who do n't share your idea of a `` pure '' national identity , and all the backcrawling in the world wo n't change that . 
  ah , you 've chosen to believe a load of bollocks and now have somehow come to the conclusion that 17.4 million xenophobes suddenly appeared overnight . 
  i suppose you do n't even know what the difference between supra and internationalism is . 
  if you 'd actually like to educate yourself , i 'd suggest the works of the bruges group , dr richard north and the ` leave alliance ' group , tony benn and perhaps some of the many [ politicians and others ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/endorsements_in_the_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum,_2016#politicians_2 ) who endorsed a leave vote ( obviously not fringe groups of fascist morons like the bnp ) . 
   and have now been backstabbed . 
  ah , the ` stab in the back ' myth . 
  last time people believed in that , they ended up starting a world war . 
  i suppose we can be thankful that commonwealth citizens did not feel ` stabbed in the back ' in 1973 when heath and co deceived millions into joining the ` common market ' yet documents like fco 30/1048 prove that they were knowingly misleading the public . 
   punish all those who do n't share your idea of a `` pure '' national identity wanting some controls on immigration is waaaycisst !!!!, 
  only glorious eu nationals can have freedom of movement and therefore cause massive influxes of cheap labour , whilst we continue to impose harsher restrictions on non-eu nationals . 
  moving to britain should be a question of the skills you can contribute and the values you share -- not the passport you hold . 
  oh , and i suppose you prefer a pure ` european identity ' to the wonderful variety of national identities found in europe , you waaaycissst . 
  i 'm sure the guardian had his statement up on their liveblog , but the only paper that actually reported it seems to be the express : http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/686615/brexit-nigel-farage-theresa-may-eu-bargaining-chip-migrants-uk-britain, 
  i 'm pretty sure farage was one of the first figures to call on may to guarantee the rights of those currently living here . 
   spat in the face of people the remain voters consider friends on the mainland . 
  the eu is n't europe . 
  one is a political union , the other is a continent full of people . 
  wanting more control over immigration does n't mean you want to stop eu nationals coming over or deport the ones living here . 
  [ some believe ] ( http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=86148 ) we could theoretically just bypass the eu and talk to the eea council instead if we wished to go for a specific type of deal .
