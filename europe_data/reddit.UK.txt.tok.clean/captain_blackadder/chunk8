   for the uk and article 50 talks , this has huge implications . 
  it would appear , on the face of it , that membership of the eea can continue as long as we join efta . 
  and , if affirmation of this principle is required , it can probably be secured by agreement not with the eu but with the eea council by consensus , which does not even require a formal vote . 
  we did n't vote to punish the eu nationals living here , we simply voted to leave the eu . 
   workers rights and pay . 
  benefits yes , but rights and pay were a large part of what led to undercutting . 
  blair had a love of cheap labour for some reason . 
  as opposed to liars like ted heath , who deceived millions into joining a ` common market ' ? 
  well , if you 're going to argue it like this - then you are no more a familiar figure to me than a polish immigrant is to you , ( with the minor exception that you approve of ira bombings that resulted in countless civilian casualties across not only ni but england and scotland as well ) . 
  and no , you ca n't refute that with ` but you supported the english govt ' . 
  because i have never stated that i approved of mass killings by either side . 
  the whole thing was a tragedy that should never have happened . 
  however , i doubt the unionists would feel the same way as you . 
  they 're certainly larger than the [ ` european identity ' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u6nj8nr.png ) community within the uk . 
  and no , i 'm not stopping anyone from campaigning to rejoin the eu or ireland , that would be immoral . 
  as i 've stated earlier , i 'd be largely neutral on reunification . 
   you can complain voting for a campaign of populist nationalism till the cows come home but that wo n't change the fact that you voted for them and continue to support them . 
  i did n't vote for a bloody campaign you feckless moron . 
  clearly you 're too thick to realise this . 
   hey share as much common ancestry and history as you and i do , and they differ politically as much . 
  http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexitvote/2016/05/30/the-eu-is-only-an-episode-in-european-history-and-is-doomed-to-failure/  there is no equivocation between the amount of experts , professionals and academics yes , because when big businesses like goldman sachs pump fucktons of money into the remain campaign , and university chancellors advise their own academeics to vote remain rather than make their mind up themselves there really is no competition in regards to tv coverage . 
  the [ leave alliance ] ( http://leavehq.com/default.aspx ) , the largest group of intellectuals , received just over # 16k in funding . 
  clearly all you want to do is constantly shout ` rural little englanders ( despite 38 % of scotland , 40 % of london , 52 % of wales and 44 % of ni voting to leave ) ' , ` the british state oppressed my people so i can never forgive the english ( yet the french forgave the germans for ww2 ) , ` populist nationalism ' . 
  it 's really not worth my time anymore . 
  yeah , that 's a load of bollocks . . 
  but continue to spout the same ridiculous argument over and over again whilst i actually have sources and documents . 
  cry ` nationalism ' and ` populism ' all you bloody want without actually acknowledging anything , fact is there were experts on both sides and we were originally decieved by heath into joining a ` common market ' . 
  seriously , the closest thing to nationalism i 've heard from any source that 's not ukip ( who make up a minority within the leave camp ) is peter shore 's [ speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j-gb8pk2pk ) from the original oxford union debate , which was also rehosted with a different cast in 2016 . 
   uk is culturally one notice how i said similar , not the same . 
  the uk is n't some borg like entity that assimilates individual cultures of those who live/immigrate there . 
   we 're as different from you as the swiss are from the germans not everything is solved with an ever increasingly centralised political union . 
  the uk has historically been devolving powers , rather than centralising them . 
  we did n't leave europe by leaving the eu - we 're still a member of the echr , the esea , the council of europe and i would say it is likely that ( as with other non-eu members ) we will be able continue on with erasmus and horizon 2020 funding . 
   however , this lack of flexibility may have more to do with political posturing than reality . 
  the european commission , by its own account , has `` always stressed that free movement was a qualified right and not an unconditional one '' . 
   in 1992 , when the eea agreement was signed , the final act records that safeguard measures were invoked by no less than four of the ( then ) seven efta members . 
  austria , iceland and switzerland cited the need to protect real estate , capital and labour markets . 
   as regards iceland , having recorded its intent to invoke article 112 in the final act , in order to protect its real estate market , it subsequently cast its net much wider in its own domestic legislation . 
  they did far more than create the euro , but that is one of the main causes of this populist insurgency on the continent . 
   first , the swiss have neither passporting nor a services agreement with the eu . 
  no , but norway and iceland do . 
   nor were the safeguard measures confined to freedom of movement .

   as regards iceland , having recorded its intent to invoke article 112 in the final act , in order to protect its real estate market , it subsequently cast its net much wider in its own domestic legislation . 
   in act no 34/1991 on `` investment by non-residents in business enterprises '' , as amended by act no . 
  121 of 27 december 1993 and act no . 
  46 of 22 may 1996 -- in article 12 - is the provision that allows the minister of commerce to block a particular foreign investment if he `` considers it threatens national security , public order , public safety or public health or in the event of serious economic , social or environmental difficulties in particular economic sectors or particular areas which are likely to be of a lasting nature '' . 
   in the case of the investment of a resident in a member state of the european economic area , it states , `` the provisions of articles 112 and 113 of the agreement on the european economic area shall be observed '' . 
  then , in response to the 2008 financial crisis , invoked article 112 safeguard measures in respect of free movement of capital . 
  this writer 's understanding is that the provision still applies . 
   moreover , the use of article 112 has not been confined to just these four countries -- or indeed any specific member state . 
  on 15 december 1995 , via regulation no 2907/95 , the commission invoked the article on its own account , making the release for free circulation of salmon of norwegian origin conditional upon observance of a floor price . 
   it should not be thought , however , that these applications amount to the full extent of the reach of article 112 . 
  the application of the article is entirely dynamic . 
  in the accession treaty for croatia , article 37 allows for a response to `` difficulties arise which are serious and liable to persist in any sector of the economy or which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a given area '' , allowing for the application of article 112 to this provision . 
  other accession instruments have the same provision . 
   however , on the basis of previous experience , there is an argument for suggesting that the uk can transition from the eu to efta while remaining in the eea . 
  the evidence for this rests with the eea agreement of 1992 , when austria , finland , sweden and switzerland were also members of efta , becoming members of the eea by virtue of their efta membership . 
   then , in 1995 , austria , finland and sweden left efta to join the eu but were not removed from the list of efta states in the eea agreement until 2004 . 
  there was , therefore no issue to deal with on transition . 
  switching the names from one pillar to the other was dealt with as a minor administrative adjustment . 
   for the uk and article 50 talks , this has huge implications . 
  it would appear , on the face of it , that membership of the eea can continue as long as we join efta . 
  and , if affirmation of this principle is required , it can probably be secured by agreement not with the eu but with the eea council by consensus , which does not even require a formal vote . 
   the outcome of a leveraged deal , using article 112 as the initial platform would -- if the liechtenstein ( and potentially the swiss ) solutions prevail -- be formal amendment to the eea agreement permitting the uk to impose agreed quotas on immigration from eu member states . 
   as to the detail , the essential point -- it would seem to this author -- is that a fully worked-up case must be made for restrictions , using the article 112 criteria of `` serious economic , societal or environmental difficulties '' , even if the article itself is not invoked . 
   in a 1992 proposal for a council regulation ( eec ) `` concerning arrangements for implementing the agreement on the european economic area '' , procedures were laid down for implementing article 112 . 
  it thus proposed that , where a member state requested the commission to apply safeguard measures , `` it shall provide the commission , in support of its request , with the information needed to justify it '' . 
   that should provide a sufficient template for the uk in relation to its brexit negotiations , permitting a reasoned settlement which is capable of attracting political support . 
   although based on article 112 , which acts as a longstop , the expectation would be of a formal amendment to the eea agreement , brokered through the eea council rather than the european council , outwith the formal framework of the article 50 ( teu ) negotiations -- but linked to them . 
   should we chose to invoke article 112 , the important thing to recognise is that it is not bending or twisting the law . 
  nor is the article an emergency provision or a `` loophole '' -- it is a fundamental part of the eea agreement . 
  thus , to enlist it to cap immigration is to use it precisely for the purpose for which it was intended .

  and , as it continues to promote said identity in order to achieve federalisation , cultural differences weaken . 
  this is different to integration via immigration . 
   in hot water and risk having their bilateral agreements with the eu suspended . 
  which is strange , because there 's no reason for that to be the case . 
  http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=86148  it has been asserted by monnet professor dougan that the eu has been content to allow `` adaptations '' to freedom of movement to apply to liechtenstein only because of its `` nature , and the size and the territorial aspects '' . 
  however , as is evident from the 1994 protocol adjusting the eea agreement , ** the original opt-out from freedom of movement provision ** , implemented under ** protocol 15 to the eea agreement , applied to both switzerland and liechtenstein . 
  ** nor were the safeguard measures confined to freedom of movement . 
  in 1992 , when the eea agreement was signed , the final act records that safeguard measures were invoked by no less than four of the ( then ) seven efta members . 
  austria , iceland and switzerland cited the need to protect real estate , capital and labour markets . 
  the government of liechtenstein invoked article 112 in respect of capital inflows , concerns about access of the resident population to real estate , and `` an extraordinary increase in the number of nationals from the ec member states or the other efta states , or in the total number of jobs in the economy , both in comparison with the number of the resident population '' . 
  it is a matter of record that , after a referendum , the swiss government was unable to ratify the eea agreement and its name was removed from protocol 15 . 
  ** had switzerland not failed to ratify , the likelihood is that both switzerland and liechtenstein would currently enjoy exclusion from freedom of movement .
