  seamus milne is well known for being a massive twat . 
   and we sure as hell want nothing to do with the nationalist populism of your brexit campaign . 
  look , i have already told you that this is a load of bollocks . 
  now , if you want to see an actual plan for brexit rather than moan about it endlessly , then [ dr richard north 's ` leave alliance ' ] ( http://eureferendum.com/ ) has one . 
  need i remind you that two republican parties supported brexit , as well ? 
   we vote differently , yes , because lab/lib/con etc do n't post candidates in ni . 
  and that 's perfectly fine . 
   entirely different political system a devolved government with mainly unionist/republican parties . 
  seems similar to holyrood , and to a lesser extent , the welsh assembly . 
   the only thing we in northern ireland share with you is the language . 
  obviously they 're a minority group but the point still stands . 
  similar , not the same - whilst the scots for example were n't ` anglo-saxon ' per se , anglo-saxons did settle in what is now scotland ( ex - kingdom of northumbria ) . 
  same with the vikings - they influenced the whole isles and beyond . 
  i 'm well aware that was largely due to conquest ( although the first king of england + scotland was a scot ) . 
  most states evolved out of warfare . 
  the uk is made up of culturally similar states . 
  as is germany , which was united under bismarck . 
  europe itself is not made up of culturally similar states and support for federalisation is low . 
  the closest to a united states of europe in history would be the roman and holy roman empires . 
  both had serious internal issues and eventually dissolved . 
  eh , i still do n't know what they 'll come up with but dr north has been advising parliamentary committees so he and his ` leave alliance ' group of intellectuals do have some influence . 
  they were doing it in hong kong a while back . 
   is the eu against having your own culture ? 
  of course it is , the plan is to replace national identities with a european one . 
   to get a good trade package from the eu . 
  we may not need to please the eu - http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=86148  however , on the basis of previous experience , there is an argument for suggesting that the uk can transition from the eu to efta while remaining in the eea . 
  the evidence for this rests with the eea agreement of 1992 , when austria , finland , sweden and switzerland were also members of efta , becoming members of the eea by virtue of their efta membership . 
   then , in 1995 , austria , finland and sweden left efta to join the eu but were not removed from the list of efta states in the eea agreement until 2004 . 
  there was , therefore no issue to deal with on transition . 
  switching the names from one pillar to the other was dealt with as a minor administrative adjustment . 
   for the uk and article 50 talks , this has huge implications . 
  it would appear , on the face of it , that membership of the eea can continue as long as we join efta . 
  and , if affirmation of this principle is required , it can probably be secured by agreement not with the eu but with the eea council by consensus , which does not even require a formal vote . 
  i guess the japanese know [ all about that . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perry_expedition ), 
  like i said , people like mosley ( and some nazis ) had similar ideas , and therefore today 's white nationalists may see merit in them . 
  the eu itself is obviously not a white nationalist fascist organisation , but considering the democratic deficit it would n't be that hard for someone to pull a reichstag fire and carry out similar policies if they wished . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxgowjbt2bu https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_b._spencer they probably like it for the same reasons [ mosley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_a_nation ) did . 
   because we 'll end up being bound to these by remaining in the eea anyway . 
   `` thank fuck , please can we stop having stupid referendums , where the future of the country is gambled to prop up the careers of the political elite now '' . 
  you do realise heath and wilson knowingly deceived millions into joining the ` common market ' in the original referendum for their own gain ? 
   but all the racists voted brexit . 
  there are white nationalists who support the eu . 
   yeah , err google `` british eu referendum '' http://eureferendum.com/default.aspx well worth a read . 
   and with each future trade deal , the uk will lose a bit of sovereignity . 
  the [ original efta agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_free_trade_association#history ) seemed to work well for us . 
  [ lord kilmuir 's letter ] ( http://campaignforanindependentbritain.org.uk/research-paper-1079-letter-edward-heath-lord-kilmuir-december-1960/ ) to heath and [ fco 30/1048 ] ( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acft/fco+30+1048.pdf ) ( classified for 30 years ) prove beyond reasonable doubt that they full well knew what the eec really was yet they sold it as a ` common market ' : http://www.harvard-digital.co.uk/euro/pamphlet.htm  `` there are some in this country who fear that in going into europe we shall in some way sacrifice independence and sovereignty . 
  these fears , i need hardly say , are completely unjustified . ''  prime minister edward heath , television broadcast on britain 's entry into the common market , january 1973 the recession itself did n't end in 73 when we joined , either : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%e2%80%9375_recession#united_kingdom, 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36367246  the out campaign blamed the common market , which through the common agricultural policy , forced britain to buy food from other member states and , to give one much quoted example , banned the import of cheap butter from new zealand . 
  `` the price of butter has to be almost doubled by 1978 if we stay in , '' warned the out campaign in its leaflet . 
  in fact , the price of butter quadrupled by 1978 , although debate continued to rage about whether the common market was entirely to blame for that . 
  i wonder if people would still produce these sorts of articles if they knew how heath knowingly deceived millions into joining the `` common market '' . 
  well , hollande and merkel are n't exactly that popular at the moment . 
  might be a similar situation in ni - iirc the dup and some minor republican parties backed leave , whereas the uup and sinn fein backed remain . 
  true , but there were snp figures like sillars , [ fairlie ] ( http://jimfairlie.blogspot.co.uk/2016/07/who-will-speak-for-1018322-scots-who.html?spref=tw ) and ~ 35 % of the membership who wanted to leave the eu . 
  they 'd have to choose between the eu ( which they had just voted to leave ) and the uk . 
  would be a huge blow for the yes camp if they decided that uk  eu, 
  http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/brexit-blow-snp-scots-want-stay-uk-says-yougov-1573278 https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/759387749317283840, 
  such an wonderful attitude . 
  i suppose you 'd rather live under the reign of a fascist dictator like mussolini than your current pm ? 
  iirc he disguised himself as a ordinary soldier , then committed suicide when he 'd been found out rather than face trial for what he 'd done . 
   you support the suppression and murder of irish people , we all get that , you 're also supporting the murder of female mps and the burning of polish families in their homes , no i do n't you absolute moron . 
  let me make this very clear : not all leave voters are far-right terrorists not all republicans are ira members not all muslims are terrorists not all germans are nazis etc please , do provide me a quote where i say `` i support the british army and their campaign of oppressing and killing of catholics '' . 
  because neither side had the moral high ground - both carried out disgusting mass killings . 
  it seems you arguments always rely on `` the english govt did some horrible things decades ago so i can never forgive english people '' . 
  do the french still hate the germans for the nazi occupation , i wonder ? 
   although i appreciate you linking to your own website because that 's not pathetic . 
  ahahahahaha you really think i 'd make a website just to link it to you ? 
  rofl you 're pathetic  celebrating these freedom fighters for getting us rights and freedoms you tried to keep from us with oppression and death . 
  tell that to the relatives of those killed by the ira , i dare you . 
  you 're a nutter who supports terrorist scum who even collaborated with the nazis and [ bombed innocents in england , rather than ni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_terrorist_incidents_in_great_britain#1970s ) repeatedly for no fucking reason . 
  enough said , really . 
   thanks to these men and women i and my people http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/troubles/troubles_stats.html well , turns out they killed more catholics than the british army did . 
  so much for protecting them from british imperialist oppression , or were they just necessary sacrifices on the altar of irish nationalism ? 
  david davis wants it done by january . 
  nato 's got that one covered . 
  the sad thing is this could have been easily avoided with better management . 
  r/europe usually - `` integration is good ! '', 
  r/europe on this thread - `` integration is too expensive and does n't work ! '', 
  at this point i 'm just inclined to believe you 're a mentally retarded troll . 
  your arguments are literally `` the british government did something bad so i 'll never forgive the english '' and `` all brexit voters are english nationalist racists '' . 
  so i assume that in your head the french have n't forgiven the germans for ww2 and the nazis and all muslims are terrorists . 
  of course , i 'm surprised you do n't believe these scumbags burning poles out of their homes were `` fighting eu oppression for their sovereignty '' , like the ira fought english oppression ( by bombing innocents in london ) . 
  people unfairly calling a leave vote racist only gave validation to these despicable racist bastards , and as for jo cox - she was murdered by a far-right terrorist . 
  tarring 17.4 million with the same brush as as vile racist murderer is just ridiculous . 
   the one thing that would change his opinion on that is if turkey would be allowed to join . 
  i thought he wanted certain reforms and if he did n't get them within a couple of years he 'd think about leaving . 
  or has he changed his mind since then ? 
  eh , true . 
  but there seems to be a lot of `` brits want the empire back '' on here yet iirc the german far-right quite like to use second reich flags . 
  the ramblings of a deluded madman stuck in his own echo chamber . 
  nowhere did i state that i approved of mass killings by either side , nor that i approved of the conduct of the british army and the paramilitaries involved on both sides . 
  was n't even around back then anyways so i could have done absolutely nothing . 
  nor did i vote for what you , as a bigoted terrorist apologist believe to be a `` nationalist populist campaign '' ( despite the brexit side being the true internationalists ) - i voted to leave the eu i.e what was on the ballot . 
  even if it were true - your line of reasoning follows the logic that if hitler was a vegetarian , all vegetarians are nazis . 
  let 's take a look at who actually supported or would have supported brexit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum,_2016#party_policies labour - 10 mp 's ( including john mann , dennis skinner and frank field ) and other associates conservatives - 138 mp 's and other associates ( and no , they 're not all `` old white males '' ) dup/tuv - conservative unionists people before profit alliance - socialist republicans ukip - self-explanatory snp - jim sillars , jim fairlie and ~ 35 % of their voters britain first/the british national party - fringe group of far-right fascist scumbags that think brexit = kick out all the foreigners \u00c9ir\u00edg\u00ed - offshoot of sinn fein respect party - george galloway 's party trade unionist and socialist coalition - socialists sdp - pre-merger lib dems liberal party - pre-merger lib dems independence from europe - fringe ex-ukip group greens - officially remain , but a splinter leave group also campaigned compared to 1975 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1975 labour - about half the party including benn ( who still held his views on the eu until his death in 2014 ) , castle , shore , foot . 
  none were accused of being a `` russian fifth column '' like some leave voters are . 
  conservatives - various backbenchers and the uup , dup , sinn fein , plaid cymru , snp plus the scumbags at the national front and the communist party ( who hate eachother ) this was never an english or a nationalist issue , and to pretend otherwise is foolish . 
  but of course , the opinion of bigoted englishmen like mr benn is worth nothing :  `` britain is , in effect , a municipality within a bureaucratic federation . 
  that 's what the guys at the top wanted ; to isolate democracy from any decision making .
