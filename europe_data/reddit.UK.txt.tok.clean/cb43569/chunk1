watching with interest from scotland . 
  i was always baffled that a grand coalition was a more natural conclusion after last year 's federal election than a broad left coalition , or -- failing that -- an spd-green minority government supported by die linke . 
  a left-led state government might help break down some of those political barriers that keep leading the centre-right to power . 
  there are , of course , marxist-leninist factions within die linke , though very much the minority . 
  i agree that we could use a broader audience , but i do n't think that means we should discuss politics any less . 
  i 've found that rain on the continent ( germany , at least ) is very different from rain in the uk , mostly in the sense that it does n't last long at all . 
  if rain comes on by surprise in a german city centre , i see people duck into alcoves to wait until it stops - which is silly behaviour to my eye , because uk rain generally lasts for hours , even if it 's just a drizzle . 
  i guess germans are more likely to believe that the rain will stop soon so they should stay under cover . 
  is greece , where syriza topped the poll , not a country `` with a modern society '' ? 
  socialism is entirely compatible with `` the realities of the modern society '' . 
  everything marx wrote about class conflict and the exploitation of the working class holds true in all capitalist countries today -- you need only a very basic understanding of marxism to realise that . 
  i could consider social-democrats and greens to be centre-left , democratic socialists to be left-wing , and communists/anarchists to be far-left . 
   each voter is issued a satoshi . 
  user sends their satoshi to the relevant ` wallet ' to cast their vote . 
  that might become complicated in other electoral systems ( like the scottish parliament 's ) , and there would have to be controls to make sure you do n't send your satoshi to another voter to vote * en bloc * . 
  speaking as an expert hacker of voting systems , are you ? 
  afraid i 'm going to have to scupper your aspirations -- i 'm on the other side of scotland and i also voted green . 
  i would imagine she means the 1967 borders , as those are regularly described and recognised internationally as the [ palestinian territories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palestinian_territories ) . 
  i 'd like a scottish pound pegged to sterling too , with a look to establishing completely independent monetary policy in the long-term . 
  quite sanguine about the notion of a formal currency union being struck , given it will only exist with the continued consent of the scottish parliament . 
  i do n't believe that amendment was ever passed into law ( nor was an attempted amendment last century trying to exclude rockall from the competence of the scottish parliament ) -- and i 'm certain there 's a * lot * of legislation that applies to `` that part of the united kingdom known as scotland '' . 
  that is designed to make it legally sound , not to protect it from a scottish claim . 
  the scottish government is quite confident that all legislation applying to scotland today will apply upon independence ( until it 's changed by the scottish parliament ) . 
   while it 's administrated under a scottish council it 's never been scottish territory er ... yes , it is , as far as the uk government is concerned . 
  it was incorporated into inverness-shire -- legally , it 's as much a part of scotland as glasgow or edinburgh . 
  ( naturally , there are still other countries that claim rockall for themselves , but there 's no legal precedent for the rump uk inheriting rockall . ), 
  yeah , me neither ... 
  the goebbels post mentioned at the end is fucking bizarre . 
  ( also , what * did * goebbels say about lenin ? ), 
  i think you meant `` variables '' , rather than `` entities '' , 
  worth noting greece had n't satisfied the convergence criteria when it acceded to the eurozone . 
  it 'd be a fucking feat if gays , catholics , islamists , and communists could govern together constructively . 
  you 've quoted the wrong comment , mate !, 
  it seems likely they 'll win at least a few seats in the next general election -- it was a seriously impressive local election result , on the back of coming second in a series of westminster by-elections , and they 'll probably sweep at the european elections in may , sadly . 
  it 's not like the `` economic freedom index '' really means much for quality of life . 
  good . 
  why not ? 
  tax breaks for fracking is a remarkably stupid idea -- bad for our economic and our environmental prospects in the long-term . 
  then how the hell can you assert that 75 % of immigrants do n't have an ni number ? 
  you 're the one saying there 's no reliable data , and yet you 're peddling an uncited figure about immigrants not having ni numbers . 
  the yorkshire devolution movement seems to be the least crazy regionalist movement in england and it 's probably also the smallest . 
  i 'm disproportionately pleased that this map includes all of the uk 's home nations instead of just the uk capital . 
  and continues to throw up barriers to integration ... 
  for what it 's worth , * every * country has a disproportionate share in the european parliament . 
  i assume that 's only for members of parties affiliated to pes ? 
   i say it about ( anglo ) canada and the us too . 
  now i * know * you 're nuts . 
  since it did n't meet the quorum ( one which is apparently universally used for referenda in san marino ) , i doubt it 'll be pursued very far , if at all . 
  i 'm intrigued , though : if san marino did join , how many meps would it have ? 
  ** edit : ** the ministry of the interior 's website indeed says `` proposta respinta '' -- this wo n't count as a yes vote . 
  was n't there some yougov poll a while back that said a lot of older english voters associate him with an `` unacceptable '' rise in immigration ? 
  tony blair ? 
  no fucking chance . 
  i 'm amazed that i 've come this far down the page and nobody 's mentioned cd projekt red and the witcher yet !, 
  maybe the two of you should start another commonwealth ... 
  it 's impossible and pointless to prove whether or not they 're more or less productive than any other workers in the uk , but i reckon it 's definitely true that they 're shat upon more by xenophobes and the right-wing press -- which earns them a bit more sympathetic respect . 
  your people have my thanks for introducing shelves filled with imported polish foods to our supermarkets . 
   people are n't going to give a damn if twenty years down the line someone can move in from the other part of the country ( perhaps where all the housing has been sold off ) and reap the benefit . 
  so ... your attitude is that people from an area where all the housing has been sold off have no right to find social housing elsewhere ? 
  ** scotland ** * the [ great scottish run ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-24419348 ) took place . 
  * somebody [ stole a 12 ft sculpture of a crocodile ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-24402577 ) from our capital . 
  * one of our high-profile comedians got invited to a st andrew 's day celebration at the prime minister 's house and [ responded on twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/kevinbridges86/status/385744934013505536/photo/1 ) with `` fuck that '' , which amused me . 
  * and the * daily mail * [ frightened us all with threats of rampant terrorism ] ( http://archive.is/4hc3o ) , as usual . 
  did i forget anything ? 
  yes and yes  i still think it 's a daft expression . 
  you sound like a credible source on these matters . 
   your infrastructure is like in a third world country have you ever been to a third world country ? 
  yeah , fuck them for bringing a progressive and egalitarian movement to the mainstream !, 
  nobody is proposing banning tobacco in ireland . 
  they 're talking about reducing demand for tobacco and i 'd wholeheartedly support most measures designed to achieve that . 
   there 's an anti-english party in power in scotland ^ [ citation ^ needed ], 
  scottish mps played a role in the introduction of fees , not their increase . 
  it 's all thanks to the stupid asymmetrical system of devolution within the uk , which was , of course , developed by the same party that introduced tuition fees in the first place . 
  but ... the same is true of golden dawn , surely ? 
  are you implying the communist party in greece is part of the system ? 
  let 's both go for it anyway . 
  do you make those ? 
  they 're real nice ; i might order a pair for a special someone at some point . 
  what part of scotland are you from ? 
  i 'm up for sending one too , but it might not be worth it unless we 're on opposite coasts . 
  want one from scotland ? 
  there 's an ongoing dispute on wikipedia as to whether the `` republic of ireland '' page should be renamed `` ireland '' and the `` ireland '' page be renamed `` ireland ( island ) '' . 
  i 'm in favour of the change , but an impassioned argument concluded with no change , so the republic 's page is still called `` republic of ireland '' . 
  or despatch instead of dispatch . 
  you seem to be misinterpreting something . 
  bookies want to hang on to their money . 
  if they 're refusing large yes bets , it 's not because they 're expecting yes to lose . 
  eh , the scottish system is still pretty weird . 
  the ballot papers are pretty similar to the ballot papers used for the federal elections in germany ( except theirs are prettier - [ germany ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/bundestagswahl_05_stimmzett.jpg ) v. [ scotland ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00634/news-graphics-2007-_634741a.jpg ) ) , but the votes are converted into seats through a completely different system . 
  this is all hearsay for the time being , but i 've heard that some book-makers are privately refusing to take large bets on the yes side -- but they seem quite happy to take large bets on the no side . 
  make of that what you will . 
  or they just wo n't vote . 
  polling already suggests that yes voters are much more likely to vote than no voters . 
  i 'm not sure these days , mostly because different organisations rank financial centres differently . 
  edinburgh is ( or was ? ), 
  europe 's fourth-largest financial centre in terms of equity assets and the second-largest in the uk , but it 's been slipping . 
  by at least one measurement , which goes beyond simple equity asset value , [ glasgow is considered the second most significant financial centre in the uk ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/glasgow-beats-edinburgh-as-financial-centre-1-2857700 ) -- but it 's tough to compare in absolute terms . 
  the * current * ranking of either glasgow or edinburgh within europe is unknown to me . 
  er ... `` complete independence '' and `` crown dependency '' are not compatible at all . 
  both gibraltar and the falkland islands have their defence and foreign policy determined at westminster , where neither have any representation .
