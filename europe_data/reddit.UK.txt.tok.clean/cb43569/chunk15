  someone decided it 'd be right to rid the walls of old , pale and stale men and have more representative artwork , so they did . 
  big deal . 
  the only people to whom this is of `` utmost concern '' are the reactionaries who are absolutely outraged about it - even though it affects them in no way at all . 
  our high european wages are quite dependent on the exploitation of people in bangladesh . 
  most british people would celebrate the empire and see it as a good thing . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/23/british-empire-crimes-ignore-atrocities http://listverse.com/2014/02/04/10-evil-crimes-of-the-british-empire/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_war_crimes, 
  i do n't think it has anything to do with a `` guilt culture '' , but i have to question whether you 're serious if you think germany 's history is significantly worse than the british empire 's record of torture , rape and mass murder when it ruled a fifth of the world in the early 20th century - within living memory for some . 
  that 'll keep the middle-class comfortable and cheery , then . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  i would n't be surprised if something similar happens in the law society of scotland soon , given that the majority of new scottish lawyers are women . 
  imagine being so deluded that you look at europe today and think the left is secretly pulling the strings ... 
  to recap : we 're allowed to enjoy the cheap clothes , cheap tech , and other cheap shit that 's produced for pennies in developing nations by western-owned companies that take advantage of the cheap labour there - but workers from those nations are not allowed to come here to look for better-paid work . 
  foreigners are for exploitation in their home countries , not for treating like human beings . 
  it keeps wages down for the government 's buddies in big business . 
  meanwhile , the growing anti-immigration sentiment on the ground serves as an obstacle to the effective organisation of workers against bosses who exploit migrants and cheap labour . 
  the ceasefire has been dead since long before that attack . 
  the actual announcement from the pkk did n't * end * the ceasefire , it simply pointed out it had `` lost all meaning '' . 
  the mods here are obviously just as evil as in / r/scotland . 
  thank god the `` indigenous '' and `` native '' peoples of europe do n't commit crime or rape . 
  thanks for helping make my case . 
  same old xenophobic bullshit , then . 
  no , it does n't . 
  it * could * mean that . 
  it could also mean there 's a significant minority posting about immigration ( usually negatively ) and causing other users to disengage . 
  it could mean a small subset of users posting about immigration a * lot * is drowning out intermittent posts from a larger number of users . 
  there could really be all sorts of reasons . 
  any reason why scotland 's missing ? 
  there 's broad support in scotland for a referendum within ten years . 
  ( [ ipsos mori ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3471/twothirds-of-scots-support-a-further-independence-referendum-within-ten-years.aspx ) , [ survation ] ( http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/revealed-daily-record-poll-shows-5195216 ) ) cameron 's ruled it out , but holyrood might be more confrontational over the issue if support for independence increases over the coming years . 
  why not , y' know , arrested and put through the french courts ? 
  it is heartbreaking that the historic persecution of racists carries on . 
  your great uncles fought fascism . 
  you 're whining about a change in rules on an internet forum . 
  can you not see why the comparison seems over-dramatic ? 
  they tend to go hand-in-hand . 
  generally speaking , most of the anti-immigration comments here are not arguing against migration on economic or sustainability terms - they 're using white nationalist arguments that say ( predominantly muslim ) immigrants overwhelmingly commit crimes , rape white women , etc. 
  to whip up xenophobia . 
  this is the principal issue . 
  surely we 'd be brigaded by / r/fullcommunism if anyone ? 
  procrastinating at work . 
  someone else made a similar comment here that was n't a joke . 
  should n't you be busy running a us presidential campaign ? 
  the fact that a number of people in this thread are , with varying degrees of jest , comparing european immigration with being brigaded by / r/coontown is so outrageously disingenuous that it beggars belief . 
  i 'm pretty sure the anti-immigrant propaganda that you wish could be shared freely in / r/europe again is more responsible for `` increased support for the right wing parties '' than polish workers . 
   why no megathreads for topics like greek debt , varoufakis or the ukraine/russia situation ? 
  there were megathreads for all of those things . 
  the [ original post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3esaee/immigration_megathread_part_i/ ) points out that this thread is `` in the same vein as the grisis threads from a few weeks ago , and the uk and greek election threads of this year '' . 
  as a leftist , you 're full of shit . 
  we 're not going to have a `` revolution '' or dismantle capitalism while people like you are sponsoring division and racism among the working class instead of organising alongside migrants against the employers who are exploiting them . 
  bosses are the enemy , not migrants or immigration . 
   labor markets are dismal . 
  most leftists would n't consider themselves beholden to market forces . 
  you 've clearly never been asked to `` disprove '' a sensationalist tabloid article with no reliable sources . 
  it 's not `` scientific data '' . 
  comments like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3esaee/immigration_megathread_part_i/ctirb67 ) are not `` scientific data '' . 
  it 's the internet equivalent of obsessively collecting newspaper clippings that reinforce existing racist prejudices . 
  there 's nothing scientific about [ implying correlation = causation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/correlation_does_not_imply_causation ) . 
  i appreciate you digging out and sharing your favourite bit of white nationalist propaganda , but your attempt to prove the barbarism of those awful foreign folk with selective internet links fails every possible legal or scientific standard . 
  you 're deluded and could use some time in the real world . 
  i 'm writing here as an active redditor that has felt pushed out of the / r/europe community over the past couple of years . 
  what compelled you to write a comment purely to mock me ? 
  i 'd rather a single thread was brigaded rather than a whole subreddit . 
  there 's a strongly racist , reactionary undercurrent in / r/europe and it 's made me a lot more uncomfortable posting here now compared to a few years ago , when it was a smaller subreddit . 
  as if racists accept logic and proof . 
   we should nip it in the bud at the source . 
  what is `` the source '' , pray tell ? 
  if there had n't been that historic interference , i doubt we 'd be in the situation where millions of people are prepared to risk their lives in boats and trucks to come to europe or britain . 
  ... so what ? 
  you 'd rather let them drown than leave the countries we colonised and bombed , eh ? 
   a village with 16.000 inhabitants that 's a town , not a village . 
   if you instantly assume that people who are against immigration are bigots , then i would imagine it is you who is the bigot . 
  this is my favourite sentence in this thread because it 's easily the most nonsensical of them all . 
  hey , i 'm not alone after all !, 
  i struggle to think of many people concerned about the population growth of `` native europeans '' who * are n't * white supremacists . 
  i 'm not saying / u/sugreev2001 is a bigot , but they should think long and hard about why they sound like one . 
  do you have to stop and remember whether you 're on reddit or stormfront before you decide whether to go with `` sjw '' or `` cultural marxist '' ? 
  perhaps i have a social conscience and not a knee-jerk instinct to reject history and continue living with the spoils of imperialism . 
  `` it 's not * my * fault !, 
  '' , i 'll say , as i live comfortably on the back of the exploitation of the developing world ... 
  yes . 
  fuck africa for not finding quick solutions to the problems we created through centuries of colonial subjugation . 
  it 's fine for nato and the eu to poke into other states ' affairs , just not filthy * russia * . 
  sometimes i like to play a game where i guess whether a comment is from / r/europe or a white supremacist forum . 
  this comment is a tricky one . 
  thanks !, 
  i was wondering why the hell we were using a three-tone map to display that range of data . 
  if ukraine had nuclear arms , do you think they 'd nuke russia over the annexation of crimea ? 
  why not ? 
  you admit ukraine would never * use * nuclear weapons against russia , so where 's the disincentive ? 
  argentina invaded the falkland islands even though the uk is a nuclear-armed state ... the `` nuclear deterrent '' is a myth . 
  now you 're coming across as arrogant as well as totally misguided . 
  ** edit : ** thanks for deleting your snarky reply and editing in an explanation of your one-line `` answer '' . 
  it still does n't make any sense . 
  large cities only exist by the grace of capitalism ? 
  how do you figure ? 
  * industrialisation * , not capitalism , led to the urbanisation of europe . 
  you can have industrial socialist societies - indeed , socialist movements tend to find their greatest support among the industrial working class , and socialist russia embarked on a huge programme of industralisation and urbanisation in the 1920s . 
  i do n't follow the condemnation . 
  putin told his government to `` begin the work to bring crimea back into russia '' before the referendum . 
  if they were n't working to bring crimea back , they would n't have had a referendum in the first place .
