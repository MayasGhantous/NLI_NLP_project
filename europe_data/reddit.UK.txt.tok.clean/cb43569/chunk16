  this is n't a revelation . 
  where do you get the idea that there was `` puppeteering '' ? 
  i assume the russian government commissioned the poll . 
  do you think people moving into illegal settlements in occupied territories in a bid to legitimise future annexation can be described as anything * other * than colonisation ? 
  self-determination typically belongs to nations , not religious groups . 
  northern ireland and israel are similar in the sense that they were created as a result of colonisation followed by partition along sectarian lines . 
  ronald storrs , one of the british governors in mandatory palestine , went as far as to write in his 1937 memoir that an israeli state could be `` a little jewish ulster '' . 
  i 'm often equally exhausted by the moral superiority some claim from being neutral . 
  this place really disgusts me these days . 
  it took a sharp turn to the right over the past few years and now it seems like your average / r/europe user is a white supremacist , either privately or openly . 
  that 's fair enough - it sounded more like you were challenging / u/10ebbor10 on there being regular conflict between the police and young people in this particular community . 
  if you do n't think the deportation of more than a million syrian refugees from europe - on the basis of their religion - qualifies as ethnic cleansing , then i think you 're the one that really needs to re-read the definition . 
  you need to seriously recalibrate your political spectrum if you think justin trudeau is `` far left '' . 
  you sound like an expert in belgian police-community relations . 
  please , tell us more . 
  you ca n't seem to find a fault in * ethnic cleansing * ? 
  let 's start with the fact that deporting `` all muslim refugees '' to `` a large chunk of desert '' would be a massive violation of international law ... 
  this is / r/europe , so probably `` kill all the brown people '' . 
   maybe salah abdelsalam was a scapegoat that let himself get found once they where ready you 're in the territory of completely unfounded speculation and guesswork now . 
  we say `` ya '' in the scottish lowlands ? 
  that 's news to me ... 
  the cookie shit is an awful law . 
  this really is n't . 
  why should massive corporations like google have a right to enable easy access to private information about eu citizens , without some kind of counterbalance like this - a process to remove content that is irrelevant , outdated or unfairly accessible ? 
  i like the fact there are some actual americans in this thread lecturing us on privacy - as if they 're doing such a great job of defending it at home ... as an eu citizen , i 'm very happy with the right to be forgotten and glad it is being enforced . 
  good for her . 
  europe could use more principled politicians right now . 
  i presume these are intended for all `` citizens '' of the islamic state , rather than militants alone . 
  any syrians living in territory captured by is are probably entitled to/heavily `` encouraged '' to get these . 
  i broadly disagree with the existing legislation as well , actually . 
  there are legitimate questions to be asked as to whether , as an example , continuing to criminalise membership of the post-ceasefire provisional ira is constructive for the northern ireland peace process , or whether preventing expressions of solidarity with overseas groups involved in armed struggle against totalitarian western-backed regimes is political censorship ( e.g. 
  why is it legal to praise some foreign rebels and not others ? 
  i know you identified the netherlands and denmark in particular , but what i said about europe applies to them too . 
  my sister and her girlfriend live in denmark and they can attest to the fact that there is still a great deal of homophobia among young white danes . 
  you might be falling into the old american trope of seeing europe as some kind of liberal utopia . 
  there are hundreds of homophobic attacks across europe on a daily basis - unconnected to muslims . 
   `` wearing , carrying or displaying of an emblem or flag , by itself , is not an offence unless the way in which , or the circumstance in which , the emblem is worn , carried or displayed is such as to cause reasonable suspicion that the person is a supporter or member of a proscribed organisation . 
   `` while support of and membership of isis is unlawful it is not a criminal offence to advocate the creation of an independent state . '' weird . 
  i think the `` reasonable suspicion '' was there . 
  there are [ legitimate arguments ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/18/shoot-to-kill-terror-fear-prejudice-jean-charles-de-menezes ) against `` shoot to kill '' in the uk , which corbyn * does * support [ when `` strictly necessary '' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34840708 ) . 
  it would be illegal in the uk as well , because of laws around `` promoting terrorism '' . 
  for the same reason , you might have trouble singing ira songs , wearing an eta badge or waving a pkk flag . 
   infitada https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb5cearuyri, 
  i doubt there are membership cards or a central database ... 
   islamic state t-shirt must have a great merchandising team . 
  opposite incidents * have * happened . 
  i live in scotland , which is a wealthy country on the edge of europe with a comparatively small muslim community , and we 've already seen muslims [ beaten up ] ( http://news.stv.tv/east-central/1332573-takeaway-owners-attacked-by-mob-of-15-citing-revenge-for-paris/ ) and a cultural centre/part-time mosque [ torched ] ( http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/14036512.muslim_cultural_centre_torched_by_thugs_in_bishopbriggs/ ) in the aftermath of the paris attacks . 
  i can imagine it 's worse in places like paris or berlin . 
  that 's only because you 're a terrible human being . 
  keep up the good work - what goes around comes around . 
  it 's a good thing asylum is a human right and not determined by a small town 's popular vote , then . 
  itt : totally-not-fascists explain how this means we need to get rid of all afghans . 
  i do n't want to `` learn to weather '' this crap . 
  there 's a right-wing orthodoxy dominating immigration discourse in this subreddit ; it 's resembling / r/european more and more by the day . 
  this is just going to continue to drive people away . 
  i 'd quite like to have a functioning and friendly subreddit for europe again . 
  six of the top five posts on / r/europe right now are negative stories about migrants or muslims - the same kind of hysterical crap that dominates the front pages of tabloids like bild or the sun . 
  for fuck 's sake , can we bring back the immigration megathread ? 
  wonder what the terrorists ' top targets will be ... 
  ireland 's neutrality is something to be fiercely proud of . 
  if scotland becomes an independent country , i 'd hope we could model ourselves on ireland in terms of the size of our military and non-participation in nato . 
  ah yes , because an online community of armchair woman-haters will be able to help, 
  i thought it was between 10pm and 10am . 
  our patriarchy is better than theirs !, 
  thank you for clearly highlighting the absolute absurdity of your view on this for all of us . 
  i will never understand how he took so much shit for calling a spade a spade . 
  what about legislation that exclusively bans those fucking masks ? 
  what 's empowering about the german government deciding what women can and ca n't wear ? 
  bucharest might get free public transport soon , too !, 
  any genuine left-wing or working class government in europe will inevitably find itself in confrontation with the european commission . 
  every tactic should be on the table when we get there . 
  it 's not really a reasonable thing to keep in mind when voting this june , though . 
  very fair point . 
  i 'm more or less using `` fringe '' and `` minor '' interchangeably - they 're a newer , smaller , non-governing party that is n't quite in the political mainstream , despite decent performance . 
  there 's a substantial portion of the left and far-left that 's backing brexit , sadly . 
  this will be an interesting one - thanks for setting it up . 
  will there be more / r/europe amas in future ? 
  i 'd love to grill representatives from various fringe parties across europe , particularly die linke . 
  probably too many folk at [ eurovision gay sex parties ] ( https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/i-went-to-a-eurovision-sex-party-and-didnt-have-sex ) . 
  do you think jan sjunnesson , formerly of the right-wing sweden democrats , is of the centre-left ? 
  i really do n't understand your question here . 
  btw , far-right \u2260 fascist . 
  i 'm queer too , mate , and do n't see what you think we stand to gain from nationalists running about with lgbt flags in a transparent attempt to link pro-lgbt politics to anti-immigration and anti-islam politics . 
  i think it 's a great thing that the left responded by organising a much larger and more successful anti-racist pride demonstration , which could play a much more important role in building links between lgbt and migrant communities . 
  cynical exploitation of lgbt people to advance their own political causes . 
  see also : skinheads-turned-feminists pretending to care about the way ethnic minority women are treated . 
  there is nothing remotely innocuous about far-right nationalists , with an openly declared opposition to `` the islamisation of sweden '' , marching into migrant communities under a progressive fa\u00e7ade . 
  there is no evidence that they actually succeeded in stoking up tensions , but it was very clearly their intention . 
  are you talking about the `` gay parade '' [ that was organised by the far-right ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/07/sweden-farright-plans-gay-pride-muslim-area-lgbt-150728180328656.html ) to try to stoke up tensions ? 
  england , wales and scotland do not allow men to donate blood if they have had sex with a man in the past year . 
  in northern ireland ( which does n't have marriage equality ) , men who have had sex with men ca n't donate blood ever . 
  you need to spend more time speaking to actual germans than in internet echo-chambers . 
  there is a very broad layer of support for germany 's welcoming of migrants and refugees . 
  closing the borders is a very fringe view . 
  a default was always on the table . 
  but besides all that - if they could n't win that point , they should have given up on governing altogether . 
  so you 're saying the problem with / r/europe is ... immigrants from / r/t _ d ? 
  the biggest tragedy of all was the capitulation of syriza to the troika over austerity . 
  what a waste that the biggest political challenge to austerity in the whole of the eu went on to become the administrators of cuts - discrediting anti-austerity politics as a whole in the process . 
  no , it actually looked like [ this ] ( https://ruthlessresearch.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/scottish-independence-question.jpg ) .
