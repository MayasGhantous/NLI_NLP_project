  the uk is not a membership organisation . 
  you do n't `` leave '' the uk . 
  `` independent '' was fine for the internationally recognised referendums in montenegro and moldova . 
  i have no idea . 
  what 's biased about `` should scotland be an independent country ? 
  ah , this is actually the proposed ballot question which was rejected . 
  the eventual ballot in 2014 asked `` should scotland be an independent country ? 
  i was expecting [ a different ballot paper ] ( http://www.gov.scot/resource/0038/00386120.gif ) ... ** edit : ** [ the actual ballot paper ] ( http://www.sott.net/image/s10/207573/full/ballot_paper_scottish_independ.jpg ), 
   they 're only people saying we need to control immigration . 
  there is not a single government in europe that wants to abolish immigration controls . 
   right now the far right parties are the only ones providing people with the illusion of safety . 
  either mainstream politics move to the right on immigration , multiculturalism and islamism or people are going to vote for far right parties . 
  what 's the point of fighting nationalists and fascists by imitating them ? 
  either we come up with an alternative , credible vision for europe in which people feel secure , * or * we go down the far-right route of blaming other peoples and cultures - and throw ourselves headlong into the 1930s again . 
  it 's not apologism to reject hate-mongering in response to tragedy . 
  you 're twisting the meaning of the words . 
  to `` destroy a people , in whole or in part '' does not mean the same as `` destroy a certain part of a people '' . 
  considering the anti-muslim rhetoric throughout trump 's `` make america great again '' campaign , i 'm not sure you can say that about american nationalism . 
  it 's about harm reduction . 
  the policy aim here is to minimise harm to children - so we need to judge whether a total ban can achieve that in isolation , or whether there are other approaches which would help deliver that aim . 
  it 's a bit like drug deaths . 
  a lot of policy-makers assume banning drugs will minimise drug deaths . 
  and yet it can actually lead to more drug deaths because of the risks associated with black market drugs and poor education . 
  i have every sympathy for any person - refugee or otherwise - who lies to avoid poverty . 
  you must be very comfortable to say definitively that you would never do the same . 
  i dunno , i reckon i could pull it off ... 
  i think / u/kashluk is trying to keep this conversation grounded in fact rather than touting sensationalist , misleading figures . 
  for that - well done , / u/kashluk !, 
   the perceived prioritisation of syrians over other nationalities has led a minority of people from countries including afghanistan to lie about their origin in the belief it will help them gain protection in europe . 
  desperate people from afghanistan pretending to be desperate people from syria because they 're scared of being sent home does n't read as `` bad intentions '' to me . 
  there 's something unsettling and voyeuristic about this being shared and upvoted here with no explanation and no context ( besides op 's comment about [ `` that non-german face in this video '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5h5vpg/a_man_steps_a_woman_down_the_stairs_in_berlin/daxntxc/ ) ) . 
  that 's not true . 
  it 's legal in a number of european countries . 
  i was homeschooled in the uk for a few years . 
  i definitely took swimming lessons in primary school , but i ca n't really swim . 
  ymmv . 
  yes , there 's an infamous quote from boris on his time working as a foreign correspondent in brussels . 
   everything i wrote from brussels i found was sort of chucking these rocks over the garden wall and i listened to this amazing crash from the greenhouse next door over in england . 
  everything i wrote from brussels was having this amazing explosive effect on the tory party and it really gave me this , i suppose , rather weird sense of power . 
  please do n't claim the moral high-ground while your racist little apartheid state is waging terror on gaza and the west bank , colonising parts of syria and illegally developing nuclear weapons . 
  probably a programme of ethnic cleansing and genocide , which could n't possibly expedite war . 
  check out the documentary * you 've been trumped * if you get the chance . 
  it follows the local residents - and environmental experts - who resisted his golf course development in the north east of scotland . 
  all the major european countries are using refugees as a political tool !, 
  firefox is really taking that valuable market share in africa , huh ? 
  as a guy who loves firefox and blackberry , it really seems that i should move from the uk to a developing nation or something . 
  none of my favourite brands have much traction in the first world . 
  yet another compelling argument for scottish independence . 
  i somehow doubt that smartphones are being included in this chart . 
  the united kingdom seems to * always * be the embarrassment of europe . 
  i think the problem facing amsterdam is that the reputation as `` cannabis capital '' of the world may outlive the easy accessibility of cannabis in amsterdam . 
  therefore , cannabis will no longer be freely available , but you 'll still see tourists come in droves looking for it , and those tourists will buy it off the street , and then you have a growing black market for cannabis in amsterdam . 
  that could harm their image even further than it is now . 
  i 've been to amsterdam twice now and i did n't smoke . 
  it 's a lovely city ; you 've got the canals , you can cycle * everywhere * , there 's fantastic architecture , there 's the van gogh museum , c'mon , there 's plenty of things . 
  and a nice thing i noticed as a non-smoking tourist was that the cannabis sub-culture thing was n't noticeable in a bad way . 
  coffee shops were n't ostentatiously advertised . 
  there were all the cannabis-featured t-shirts , of course , but i 'm not sure i 'd count that ( i 've seen plenty of similar things in london ) . 
  if what i described in my first paragraph happens , tourists that are * not * interested in drugs may be turned off by a suddenly increased presence of drug dealers , high people on the street , a smell of marijuana pervading the city even outwith coffee shops . 
  that means you could try to stop drug tourism , but inadvertently damage tourism all around and also enable a much less pleasant drug market . 
  ** edit : ** i 'm half-playing devil 's advocate here , and i 'd really be interested in hearing your thoughts . 
  i rarely have opportunities to discuss this sort of thing with amsterdam locals , and i 'd like to find out how they see it . 
  since alcohol will also make tourists throw up , do you think they should outlaw that as well ? 
  on top of that , do you think those living in amsterdam are particularly less likely to throw up in a public place ? 
  i would n't be surprised if the locals are occasionally rowdy as well . 
  i think he 's just confused about the fact that , for instance , eu citizens can attend university in scotland for free because the scottish government is legally obliged to extend to eu citizens the same rights as they do to their own . 
  if this is the case for a major point like university education , why is it that the dutch government can limit this to only those resident in the netherlands ? 
  where is the distinction drawn ? 
  ** edit : ** is it because attending university in scotland would , to an extent , count as `` residency '' and give them the right to free education ? 
  much like living in the netherlands would give you the right to a * wietpas * ? 
  yes , sorry , i was n't trying to influence the entire electorate there , haha . 
  my point was , i strongly doubt nick griffin would have a shot at a european seat if people actually gave stronger weight to european elections . 
  improve the turn-out , improve the visibility of the election and those contesting it , and try to educate voters ; you can probably diminish a lot of euroscepticism just by pointing out how the uk government still has a lot of power itself , and that the european union is still a democratic force in which every voter has a voice . 
  and electing a good representative to be your voice is a big part of that . 
  it 's william hague ; what did you expect ? 
  i have absolutely no confidence in the conservative party , and i hope for the sake of myself and many others that scotland can win the independence referendum in 2014 and detach ourselves from them . 
  we can forge a better , european future for ourselves without having those millions of tories bogging us down . 
  ** edit : ** the following is talking only about federalised europe . 
  i 'm all for scotland joining the current implementation of the european union as well , as its assorted trade agreements are very beneficial to scotland 's economy , and the right to free movement is a boon for tourism and the european people . 
  i can go into this in more detail if you 'd like me too . 
  like i said : it 's idealistic , and i would only support it if we can bring about the end of so many ideological schisms . 
  as it is now , we 've got waves of fascism coming in from greece , socialism from france , right-leaning stuff from germany and the uk , and the beginnings of constitutional crumblings in spain . 
  lots of things in europe are changing . 
  if , though , out of this the people express that they have a shared vision of government -- for example , all europe embraces social democracy -- then i do n't see why a single european state should n't be created . 
  that 's my key criterion , though : more than a few degrees of agreement between the states . 
  it might work better if it starts with fewer countries , such as those just in the north-west ( incl . 
  germany , france , british isles ) . 
  ratify legislature that identifies a way for states to secede , such as `` every three years , states are given the opportunity to secede ; if they do , they ca n't rejoin for another twelve years '' and what you have is not undemocratic , but internationalist and co-operative . 
  i ca n't envision that happening in the middle of an economic crisis , but after the economic crisis , when we have fiscal security and ideally some level of social consciousness ? 
  it could happen . 
  i 'm also amazed that there are genuinely people who have n't heard of strasbourg , brussels , luxembourg , or frankfurt . 
  really ? 
  people have n't heard of * luxembourg * ? 
  it 's an entire country . 
  i reckon that if you 're so uneducated that you 're a european and you have n't heard of an actual european country , then you probably do n't display much of an interest in politics anyway -- or you 're focussing on the wrong points of politics . 
  i do n't think we should waste money on winning the votes of fools . 
  i support scottish independence and i 'm not entirely opposed to a federal or confederal european state in principle ; i just do n't think it would work very well for the time being , because there are so many different ideologies around ( emerging fascism in particular ) . 
  i want to leave the united kingdom because westminster is currently filled with politicians with little to no support here in scotland and they 're inflicting policy on us . 
  that 's a problem that can be fixed with devolution . 
  i support * independence * because i 'm concerned by the uk 's foreign policy , which you ca n't realistically devolve ; i do n't want westminster to call the shots on the scots ' eu membership or currency .
