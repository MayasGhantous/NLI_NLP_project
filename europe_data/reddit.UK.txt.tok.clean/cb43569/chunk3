  welcome to the union , our friends in croatia , 
  the treaty of lisbon enshrines member states ' right to leave the european union -- being a voluntary participant in an international treaty which you 're allowed to leave at any time does n't sound like a sacrifice of sovereignty ... 
  not at all . 
  scotland has only had its own parliament since 1999 . 
  before then , even laws that only affected scotland were voted on by the whole uk 's house of commons like any other law ( and that 's still the case with [ certain matters ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reserved_and_excepted_matters ) ) . 
  you 're right in that homosexuality was decriminalised in scotland two years later than england and wales , but i 've no idea why . 
  part of the reason may be that scotland has [ a separate legal system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scots_law ) , which sometimes mean laws affecting scotland have to be passed separately ( and scotland is usually lower on the house of commons ' list of priorities ) . 
  got a link to a news story for that last one ? 
  me too !, 
  [ sometime before the uk election in may 2015 , according to the * guardian * . 
  ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/jun/28/labour-early-vote-uk-eu-membership ), 
  why did they form a coalition if they already have a majority ? 
  in the uk and scotland , coalitions are sort of a last resort when you do n't a majority by yourself . 
  ** scotland ** * our equal marriage bill got introduced at the scottish parliament !, 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-23067324 ) ) * the scottish parliament voted to let 16 - and 17-year olds vote in the referendum next year . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/scotland-23087716 ) ) * the edinburgh international film festival drew to a close -- closing film is * not another happy ending * , starring karen gillan and stanley weber . 
  i interviewed the director !, 
  you can read that [ here ] ( http://thetarge.co.uk/hub-culture/film/john-mckay-on-not-another-happy-ending-and-scottish-filmmaking/0056 ) , if you fancy . 
  that 's about it , i think . 
  hear hear . 
  see you all in a few years !, 
  we 've historically had norse-gael and pictish populations , so not quite as celtic as ireland , at least . 
  aww ... but we stole most of our islands from norway !, 
  does that count for nothing ? 
  how about scotland - can we be nordic too ? 
  we have oil and social democracy !, 
  and it can not into nordics . 
  this is all i know of estonia . 
  i knew what that was going to be as soon as the title came up . 
  if you think socialism is about a ) high taxes , or b ) the government owning everything , then you have a shallow and uninformed understanding of socialism . 
  what do you propose , then ? 
  how do we filter out the radicals from the non-radicals in the immigration process ? 
  at one in three and a half million , it 's probably one of the rarer ways to die . 
  apply that statistic to scotland and we 'd have one death a year by terrorism , which makes it negligible in comparison to things like hate crime and homelessness , which are n't addressed in the media and the parliaments with as much zeal as terrorism . 
  i think it 's unfair to condemn the principle of common ownership as a route to making everyone `` equally poor '' based on a single failed model of socialism tried in india . 
  socialism and capitalism are broad economic systems that can be accompanied by wildly different policies and principles , some of which are more effective than others . 
  there are countries all over the world , particularly in africa , where the economy has simply stagnated despite a pursuit of capitalism - that should make clear that it is not the capitalist/socialist choice that determines success . 
   we like our tvs and smartphones , and efficient cars . 
  these are not things that are lost through socialism or through revolution . 
  there 's a general expectation that english speakers in europe will speak , you know , the only european brand of english - the british kind . 
  was n't there a thread here in / r/europe just the other day noting that most people here learnt british english at school since it 's deemed the most relevant in the context of europe and the eu ? 
  ack , that just disgusts me . 
  thank you for the well-reasoned and detailed response !, 
  i have a lot of literature about the irish independence movement and afterwards that i 've yet to get around to reading ; it 's a fascinating topic ( which often incites despair ) about which i honestly have to concede i know very little . 
  thanks for the extra education . 
  do you think the people that volunteered to fight fascism in spain were `` brainwashed '' ? 
  this is about having a strong political ideology , not being brainwashed . 
  no double standards . 
  they might not be mentioning religious motivations , but religious sectarianism is still a huge part of the conflict . 
  are targets being chosen based on religion ? 
  if so , that 's basis to call them religiously motivated attacks . 
  do bombing campaigns in northern ireland count as religiously motivated ? 
  excellent . 
  if this encourages more bicycle use , and investment in bicycle infrastructure , that can only be good . 
  then let me , a european , say the same thing . 
  but accelerating the resolution of those human rights issues is a good reason to start accession talks . 
  turkey is only 70-75 % ethnically turkish , according to the cia world factbook , so we 're talking about 55.5 million turks compared to 66 million ethnic germans . 
  you 're right in that germans would no longer comprise the majority of the population if the entire population of turkey moved to germany , as only 42 % of the country would be ethnically german , but it 'd still be the largest ethnic group by a considerable degree . 
  these are the kind of things turkey will have to deal with before joining - which means that the eu accession process could be a hugely positive and constructive step for turkey in all senses . 
  i think he was asking about the vandalism . 
  i 'm genuinely shocked . 
  that 's weird to me , since scottish independence movements are linked to the opposite . 
  which statistic from that link are you citing , exactly ? 
  there are a wide range of questions there , none of which can be taken to mean `` support [ of ] people like this '' . 
  you 've got me there  even still , though , it 's not prominent in party politics , which is what i 'm talking about . 
  yep , and it 's been echoed all round by local communities like that of the [ glasgow central mosque ] ( http://thetarge.co.uk/hub-current-affairs/scotland/glasgow-mosque-woolwich-attack-has-no-basis-in-islam ) , too . 
  are you aware that arabs are also a semitic people ? 
  who are `` they '' ? 
  are you suggesting that the uk 's muslim community as a whole `` usually '' kills people ? 
  source ? 
  you think muslims just concentrate in an area and then the riots start ? 
  that 's alarmist , xenophobic tripe and you should be fucking ashamed of yourself for spreading it . 
  did you really just seek to compare europe with * israel * ? 
  israel has problems with muslims integrating ? 
  that 's its problems . 
  those pesky muslims causing trouble in the land that rightfully belongs to the jews , who are n't breaking un resolutions or anything . 
   do n't donwplay the `` muslimness '' of the situation . 
  it does n't happen in poor portuguese or polish communities or mexican , or chinese . 
  yeah , it 's not like we had [ riots in england ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_england_riots ) where [ 42 % of those charged were white ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15426720 ) . 
  oh , boy , you * really * need to brush up on your knowledge of catholicism in mediaeval europe and western colonialism if you think islam has a bloodier history than we do . 
  similarly , it must not be off the table to discuss non-immigration causes of riots . 
  nobody seems to want to talk about class inequality or discrimination - those blaming immigration seem to silence anyone that suggests that this is not an inherent issue with immigration . 
  in true british fashion , we set up a [ uk space agency ] ( http://www.bis.gov.uk/ukspaceagency/ ) in 2010 instead . 
   newly joined poland ( just the end of last year ) gives 0.9 % , music to my ears !, 
  poland can into space ? 
  agreed . 
  the simple truth is that event organisers , even when they 're not exaggerating , just ca n't judge crowds as well as trained police can . 
  we throw around the ol' `` it discriminates against straight people and christians ! '', 
  here in the uk . 
  they might not be `` unmarried '' , but surely the law could be reverted to a state where only existing marriages are recognised ? 
  something like mexico ( i think ? ), 
  where gay couples ca n't marry , but gay couples who married abroad have their marriages recognised ? 
  it 's really weird how prominent religion seems to be in politics in america and the continent . 
  it does n't really feel like a major part of the political scene in the uk or in scotland , whereas you have ump folk like that in france , and merkel heading a `` christian party '' , and so on . 
  i 'll be happy when all the religious talk finally loses relevance to the national decision-making process . 
  i would n't use south park to back up examples of people becoming more tolerant . 
  i still see the episode where stan 's dad decides to become a dolphin used to back up transphobia . 
  nah , i downvoted you and i 'm definitely european . 
  he 's right , though . 
  the world as a whole has an overpopulation issue , and couples choosing to adopt instead of having kids themselves means they do n't contribute to that issue ( and give a poor kid a loving home in the process ! ) .
