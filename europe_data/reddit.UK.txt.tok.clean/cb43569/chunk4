  more stable gay couples who can adopt probably means more adoptions . 
  that all said , i do see the attraction in having your own kid instead of adopting : / ( i 'm the man part of any couple , though . ), 
  french nationalism is becoming a thing ? 
  as a scottish socialist : * shudder * . 
  right , but they usually just pitch `` free uk calls '' - no ireland . 
  `` free british isles calls '' is interesting . 
  i 've never been offered that by telecoms here in scotland . 
  it 'd be a good idea to revise that sentence to `` it 's pretty shameful that gay pride marches * have to * exist '' , otherwise it comes across badly . 
  `` hispanics can integrate , but islamic peoples ca n't '' is , in itself , racist . 
  do n't underestimate the power of socialisation . 
  american jokes about france 's military capacity wo n't go down well in / r/europe . 
  that is not what the moderators are doing here , and to claim so is a fucking persecutory delusion . 
  that 's ... exactly the wrong way to evaluate this . 
  you 'd be better off looking into how the economic and social situation in europe which is creating the need to look for a scapegoat is , in itself , fuelling discontent among the lower classes , and social groups comprised largely of immigrants . 
  so if we can do without something , we should be rid of it ? 
  we should do away with all the old people , then . 
  we would be fine ( and even better ) without them . 
   but these men had nothing in common with iraq or afghanistan in fairness , adebojalo was reportedly `` once best friends '' with a british soldier who was killed by a roadside bomb in iraq ( [ source ] ( http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/woolwich-suspect-michael-adebolajo-was-best-friends-with-a-soldier-blown-up-in-iraq-8630593.html ) ) . 
  i 'm not sure how that could possibly tie into his motives , though . 
  the riots in london recently showed how wiling people are to blame these events on the character of certain individuals and social groups , without any interest in addressing the underlying cause . 
  it seems the same is happening with the media response to the riots in stockholm . 
  which is , you know , quite right , because we should n't . 
   then why are n't there many people murdering in the name of atheism on a daily basis ? 
  because the world has a tiny proportion of atheists in comparison to christians and muslims , and atheists generally do n't find themselves in social situations where they are discriminated against ? 
  i live in ** scotland ** and it 's neither great nor terrible . 
  there 's been [ a bit of investment lately ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-18359184 ) , but the uk government 's targets are really nothing special ; they have widespread 100 mbps access as a * target * , so most britons are probably quite jealous of the situation in sweden . 
  it describes 80-100 mbps access as `` ultrafast '' . 
  the scottish government 's target , according to [ this parliamentary report ] ( http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/currentcommittees/48856.aspx ) , is broadband speeds of 40-80mbps for 85 % to 90 % of premises in scotland by 2015 . 
  to compare , sweden 's target is for 40 % of households and businesses to have access to 100mbps by 2015 , and 90 % of households and businesses by 2020 . 
  bit of a disparity . 
  sigh ... 
  i was favouring bvb . 
  poor guys . 
  nothing in my comment was a defence of choudary as an individual nor his many broken views -- it was entirely an attack on channel 4 for preventing him from delivering a cogent answer to the question that was put to him . 
  frankly , there is a large gulf between the vaguely defined `` radicalisation '' and incitement of violence . 
  if i stopped an average person on the street and conveyed some of the sheer injustices committed by the british state , i will likely make them very damn angry at the government ; have i now `` radicalised '' this person , and must i now take responsibility for anything they do in response to this knowledge ? 
  no , of course not . 
  this was the valid argument that choudary was repeatedly blocked from sharing on television when he was inexplicably asked to take responsibility for a murder that somebody else had committed . 
  russia is transcontinental . 
  that means that there are european elements to it . 
  do you mean armenian ethnicity but raised in the us ? 
  and the uk needs europe , but are too foolish to acknowledge so . 
  talking about american 's bipartisan hegemony as if it promotes constructive debate . 
  yeah , right . 
  ah , the royal family . 
  elevated to a state of importance in our country by virtue of their privileged birth , and full of people who set an excellent example for our country 's budding ignorants . 
  [ the language of the basque people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basque_language ) ? 
  i 'm genuinely surprised that german does n't spill over a bit further to reflect the german land that was annexed at the end of world war ii . 
  i figured there could be a german-speaking generation or two following that . 
  uh , no , [ that 's just where it is ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/europe-iceland.svg/500px-europe-iceland.svg.png ) . 
  where 's the distinction ? 
  for what it 's worth , wikipedia says `` the matter of whether or not ` moldovan ' is a separate language is a contested political issue within and beyond the republic of moldova '' . 
  cardiff is n't represented as welsh for the same reason dublin is n't represented as irish . 
  well , manx is represented , so surely cornish should also be represented , no ? 
  i do n't understand why scottish gaelic and irish gaelic are given the same colour , but manx gaelic is given a different one . 
  they 're all about as different as each other . 
  * putrid * meat ? 
  okay , now i 'm disgusted . 
  i noticed something similar when he was being interviewed on channel 4 . 
  the presenter asked if he took responsibility for the killing because of his role in radicalising the woolwich killer , and he began explaining , rather sensibly , i thought , that no , he did not feel that he had to take responsibility , because his sole role was in disseminating facts about actions committed by the british government - he did not feel that amounted to incitement of violence , and effectively felt that there was nothing immoral about simply sharing details about what was done by other people . 
  it was a very cogent point , yet the presenter barely allowed him to speak for five consecutive seconds , interrupting him almost immediately after he started speaking with a barrage of `` do you take responsibility ? '', 
  and `` why do n't you take responsibility ? '' . 
  it was a bullshit interview , and i feel that is true of most of choudary 's media appearances . 
  spun to suit the media 's agenda . 
  let 's not speed the process . 
  to be hungary is to be of potato ? 
  it made [ a degree of sense ] ( http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/deut/nederl.jpg ) in the 17th century ... 
  i wonder , though , whether illegal guns are more readily available in the czech republic as a result of its more laissez-faire approach to private gun trade in comparison to the uk . 
  you can not compare absolute numbers of gun homicides when one country has a population of 10 million and the other has a population of 63 million . 
  you look at * rates * , not absolute figures ; this is true for all statistics when comparing countries . 
  ah , ok , i understand you . 
  wording confused me . 
  the czech republic 's firearm homicide rate is also three times that of the uk . 
  i 'm pointing out , with facts , that it 's utter bullshit to suggest that the uk has more gun violence than the czech republic , and even dumber to attribute that to the difference in gun laws . 
   see the czech republic . 
  less people were murdered there with guns than the uk , and the gun homicides with legally obtained guns are extremely rare . 
  the czech republic has a decisively higher firearm-related death rate than the uk . 
  see [ this page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate ) . 
  not anti-americanism at all . 
  your scenario ignores that the attackers would have easier access to guns as well , and reimagining this entire scenario with every attacker , victim , and witness armed with guns ( and the audacity to attempt to use them ) would have just led to a violent escalation beyond what happened today . 
  do you seriously believe that ? 
  how on earth would different gun laws change anything about this episode ? 
  it was a murder . 
  murders happen in countries with all sorts of gun laws . 
  i seem to recall that the us has hundreds of thousands of armed civilians , yet an awful record of many terrorist attacks going ahead unstopped . 
  it is an immense generalisation to suggest that the british `` despise '' the muslim religion . 
  i 'd hate to introduce you to british muslims who obviously do n't despise their religion . 
  could it not have showed up faster given that , you know , this supposedly happened right outside an army base ? 
  who are `` the rest of the murderers '' , exactly ? 
  i 'm sure you could fill a book with irish names that europeans have never heard of nor have any idea how to pronounce . 
  a survey at the 30,000 subscriber point sounds like an excellent idea . 
  i 'm not sure about questions , but certainly some queries about immigration and multiculturalism should go in there . 
  also maybe questions on whether or not people vote in the european parliament elections , and how important they consider the european parliament elections ? 
  agreed . 
  ( also , does * anyone * get paid to use reddit ? 
  sounds unlikely , but if so , i 'll take that job . ), 
  i 've never seen an olive oil jug in a restaurant in the uk , just bottles . 
  you can fuck right off if you 're seriously audacious enough to tell people where is and is not their home . 
  ethnicity is not the sole arbiter of nationality . 
  i am not entirely ethnically scottish nor was i born in scotland , but i 'm either scottish or i 'm nothing at all .
