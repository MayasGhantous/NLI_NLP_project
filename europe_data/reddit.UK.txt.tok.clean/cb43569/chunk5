  that 's an interesting idea . 
  i think more people are concerned about the coast being submerged long before it has a chance to erode , though , 
  sadly true . 
  strange , i never see `` you people '' explaining why you are right ; you just counter accusations of racism with `` all you do is accuse me of racism '' . 
  i think it possibly confounds you that people call you out for what you 're saying . 
  / r/europe sadly seems to become * that * subreddit with every passing day . 
  it 's simultaneously terrifying and heart-breaking . 
  please visit more . 
  i do n't want to have to deal with the racists alone . 
  as far as i 'm aware , it 's exclusively a scottish word . 
  you use it after misspelt words in a quote to indicate that the original source had an incorrect spelling , rather than you having introduced it . 
  er , nothing i said has anything to do with white guilt . 
  based on , what , the opposite of what all the current evidence suggests ? 
  check your monitor 's colour profile or consider printing out the image to examine before you assume you 're colourblind . 
  i would n't dare swim in the thames , but i would consider the english channel . 
  the latter is popular with swimmers , is it not ? 
  that said , i do think our bathing water is of a higher quality as well . 
  would be interested in a regional break-down . 
  where on earth is that ? 
  i wonder what a regional breakdown for the uk would look like . 
  get rid of that apostrophe . 
  what if the queen sees ? 
  increasingly common to study american texts in english literature classes , though , which is hell . 
  study a text in one variant of the language , then write about it in another . 
  i think i eventually developed a habit of peppering every american quote with '' [ sic ] '' . 
  well , what do you think british english is , exactly ? 
  it 's a single variant of english , just as scottish english . 
  scottish english has some distinct grammar rules , like how it 's acceptable to drop `` to be '' from sentences like `` the windows need washed '' , and some words not really considered valid british english , like `` outwith '' . 
  british english refers to a single , specific set of rules , not to all the varieties spoken in the uk - so no , scottish english is n't british english . 
  really ? 
  most friends of mine and myself will write exclusively british . 
  some people certainly mix their vocab , but i 'd be surprised if it were the majority . 
  ( though i 'd love to see a study . ), 
   gymnasiast you mean `` secondary school student '' or `` grammar school student '' . 
  `` gymnasiast '' in english just sounds like a weird way of saying `` gymnast '' ( turner ) . 
  so which is it ? 
  you have to hear better or they have to talk slower ? 
  i do that with most games i play with the option , most recently with ni no kuni , which actually has british voice-overs !, 
  just could n't stand them . 
  i think part of it is that everything automatically sounds less cheesy if you ca n't understand it . 
  i 'm not convinced there is such a thing as `` internet english '' . 
  people just use their native flavours of english with international internet slang added on top . 
  my german has gone decisively downhill since i stopped getting rtl . 
  punctuation is a major difference that many people overlook . 
  americans have this nasty , immensely frustrating habit of putting punctuation within quotation marks that really do n't belong . 
  for instance , if they 're ending a sentence with a quote , they 'll put the full stop inside the quotes , like `` this . '', 
  the proper british english way is like `` this '' . 
  i use `` subway '' in regards to glasgow 's underground transport , and i believe that 's the norm . 
  as soon as you whipped out `` actual swedish people '' , you just reinforced a broken concept that in order to be `` actually '' swedish , you must be white . 
  that is an anachronistic approach to national identity that deserves no further perpetuation . 
  ** edit : ** bravo , / r/europe . 
  effectively blocking any suggestion that a person can be both swedish and non-white . 
  hopefully he 'll buy his way onto a distant space colony with all that money . 
  c'mon , esa , pump up your space endeavours ... 
  british here . 
  pretty sure we block out eurovision from the national consciousness because we always do terribly in it and we hate the continent anyway . 
   i do n't see why you 're trying to argue that there 's an issue with the house of lords because there is . 
   and using this is a reason for your hatred of britain i do n't hate britain . 
   it 's not completed , but it 's still in reform . 
  when its further reform [ fails to make it through the house of commons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_lords_reform_bill_2012 ) , i would n't say it 's `` still in reform '' . 
   the members of the house of lords are now elected and nominated , and there 's no inherited members . 
  so , [ these people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_elected_hereditary_peers_under_the_house_of_lords_act_1999 ) are what now ? 
   you 're a waste of my time ditto . 
  you leap to the assumption that i even have scottish parents ? 
  you think comments regarding economic imperialism , which i have no doubt * you * poorly understand , are seated in a `` bitter hate '' for england ? 
  that 's unfounded rubbish , and the characterisation of my views as `` xenophobic , nationalistic and angry '' is not evidenced by any of your quotes or comments . 
  my comments make very clear my issue with the house of lords and the house of commons ; i wrote of the `` unfair role in our government '' played by church of england bishops in the house of lords and its other unelected members , and the abject democratic travesty of labour 's 2005 electoral victory with 35 % of the popular vote . 
  if you honestly believe that i `` probably do n't know why '' i take issue with these broken institutions , then you either did n't read my comments or you 're trying to rationalise a baseless distaste for my educated political opinions . 
  here 's a challenge for you : try to argue against my actual points instead of resorting to * ad hominem * attacks . 
  really ? 
  * my * comments are `` emotional '' ? 
  like [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/scotland/comments/1e2g0h/i_was_asked_by_a_reporter_from_the_telegraph/c9w7kzm ) and [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/scotland/comments/1e2g0h/i_was_asked_by_a_reporter_from_the_telegraph/c9wfxz8 ) and [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/scotland/comments/1dcrfk/independence_movement_post_2014/c9pts9p ) and [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1dqs4w/why_should_i_support_an_independent_scotland/c9wpab6?context=3 ) ? 
  these are also just the ones i have at hand from posting * recently * . 
  any comments i make regarding the referendum have consistently provided detailed break-downs with citations and links , but please do n't let that get in the way of your baseless assertion that my argument for independence is somehow `` emotional '' . 
  ( also find it hilarious that you 're talking about me not posting any credible articles in the comments section of a credible article that i posted . ), 
  ** edit : ** if you can find even a * single * comment where i argue for independence on an emotional basis , i will buy a fucking hat and eat it . 
  uh , no , it 's a political issue in which i , as a citizen of scotland , have a serious investment , so i 'm doing my best to promote debate . 
  i 'm also not writing in `` every reddit thread '' , it just so happens to be that i * posted * this thread . 
  probably most likely it 's so any issues with the withdrawal get passed onto the next government . 
  ... and increases inflationary pressure , you might add . 
  the snp will dominate scottish politics * until * they win the referendum . 
  independence is probably the only thing that will bring more diversity into the scottish parliament . 
  divorcing scottish labour and the scottish conservatives from their westminster counterparts is the only way that either will ever again gain traction in holyrood . 
  drop the unfounded hyperbole and please explain to me how independence would somehow transform scotland into a single-party state . 
  er , i made no claims regarding support for independence - i 'm simply pointing out that it is wholly disingenuous to claim that a `` majority '' have `` consistently '' supported the union , because that 's not the case . 
  reconsidering the relationship between the central and local government is not on the table . 
  the only counter-proposal to independence so far have been vague promises about extending the power of the scottish parliament , and those proposals come nowhere close to the transferral of power that independence would entail ; there is no suggestion that the scottish parliament would control welfare or pensions , and scottish labour 's proposal that the scottish parliament should control income tax was shot down by westminster mps just last month . 
  of course i know that `` not all scottish people have the same values '' , but this is irrelevant , because i 'm not talking about establishing a scottish national party dictatorship - i 'm simply talking about transferring power from one parliament to another . 
  as a political unit , the people of scotland have distinct values from the people of the uk as a whole ; this is obvious from [ the 2010 general election result ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:2010ukelectionmap.svg ) and the make-up of the scottish parliament compared to the house of commons . 
  i 'm just saying that i 'd rather decisions affecting scotland were made in line with the democratic will of the scottish people as a whole , which is not happening in the union . 
  i find it curious that you think `` some scottish right-wing entity will arise '' after independence . 
  why ? 
  right-wing entities are not performing well in the scottish parliament elections right now . 
  why will they suddenly perform better after independence ? 
  besides , at least the electoral system for the scottish parliament is fairer and prevents the sort of bullshit majorities turned out by the house of commons for barely a third of the popular vote . 
  given that the electoral reform society in the uk has the hilarious honour of being the oldest electoral reform campaign in the world ( and therefore perhaps being the least effective in the world ) , independence is likely the best shot we have at having decisions regarding , say , welfare and pensions made in a democratic way that is in line with the views of the people of scotland . 
  i 'd rather take independence when it is offered in 2014 than join what will be an undoubtedly decades-long campaign to devolve all but defence to the scottish parliament . 
  i ask `` how ? '', 
  and you say `` just because '' . 
  compelling argument .
