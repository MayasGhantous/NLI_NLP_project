  i 'm also not much further than `` ciamar a tha sibh ? 
  but it 's a start . 
   of course they have a right to independence - they 're holding a referendum on it , with the acquiescence of the rest of the union !, 
  yeah , and we 're being told that this is the only one we 'll have for `` a generation '' , because we wo n't be treated to `` a neverendum '' . 
  thanks for the update !, 
  i think i 'll take a few english notes with me next time anyway , just in case , 
  they are n't reporting much of it up north either . 
  i 'm sorry for being unnecessarily belligerent - stressful day !, 
  in any case , while we do indeed have representation , we elect only 59 of 650 mps in westminster , meaning that the entire country of scotland is represented by fewer people than london , which alone elects 73 . 
  while `` the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few '' , i think you can see where the argument for independence comes from : westminster will * never * prioritise scotland over london , and that 's damaging , considering that scotland needs economic and social policy distinct from that which best serves westminster . 
  do you think alaska and texas could successfully share a centralised government ? 
  do you think a parliament permanently located in texas could comprehend the needs of alaska without having any idea of what it 's like to live there ? 
  westminster essentially acknowledged the need for some degree of devolution when we got the first devolution referendum in the '70s , before thatcher really devastated the economy up north with london-centric policies . 
  even though we voted in favour , we were screwed out of it , and had to wait until ' 97 , under another government entirely , before we really got it , and then the scottish parliament reconvened in ' 99 . 
  since then , we 've diverged significantly politically . 
  the nhs in england and wales is being slowly privatised , while scotland 's is protected ; scotland even has no prescription fees , whereas england and wales does . 
  tuition is vastly different : you can go to university * for free * in scotland if you 've lived here for a couple of years , whereas it can cost as much as # 9,000 a year down south . 
  scottish water ? 
  a state-owned company , compared to the private companies operating in england and wales . 
  an entirely different legal system , distinct from that operating in england and wales . 
  there are many more little differences which i ca n't care to list , which essentially add up to : with devolution , scotland is becoming a very different part of the uk . 
  now , the argument against independence generally goes : `` if things are so good with devolution , why go further ? '' . 
  well , besides the fact that important things like welfare and pensions ( supported in scotland , being slashed by the uk government ) are still reserved to westminster , there 's the matter of scotland 's budget . 
  we get it through something called the barnett formula , which , in recent years , means that the scottish government 's budget is * smaller * than the tax revenue raised in scotland . 
  this essentially means scots are paying tax that is going to westminster instead of holyrood . 
  this means holyrood 's ability to continue delivering free tuition , for instance , is being threatened by a parliament where only 59 out of 650 people represent scotland 's best interests . 
  there was originally going to be a third option on our 2014 referendum which offered `` devolution max '' , which would have been devolution to the extent that scotland would receive every penny raised in the country , and would be able to legislate on welfare and pensions , etc. 
  that option is no longer on the table - it was taken off the table by the uk government , who have chosen instead to `` promise '' we 'll get further devolution in the case of a `` no '' vote . 
  the uk government historically is not very good at sticking to its promises - thatcher famously promised an alternative form of devolution should we reject the referendum in the '70s . 
  we said * yes * to the referendum in the '70s and * still * received nothing . 
  for * decades * !, 
  also , even devolution max would n't give us control over , say , defence . 
  this may not strike you as particularly important , but right now , all of the uk 's weapons of mass destruction are based on the clyde , roughly thirty miles from scotland 's biggest city . 
  they regularly [ leak radioactive waste ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/may/18/mod-nuclear-waste-submarines ) into the river . 
  they are not wanted in scotland , and there have been protests against their presence for decades . 
  [ there are more planned for april . 
  ] ( https://www.facebook.com/events/465392046829257/ ) people will probably be arrested . 
  this is n't a comprehensive list of reasons , but i hope you feel a bit more enlightened having read it . 
  that 's a fair remark . 
  i did say `` less eurosceptic '' rather than `` no euroscepticism '' , 
  lallans and proud , unfortunately . 
  in what way was it a completely different situation ? 
  the americans felt they were not adequately represented at westminster ; nor do we in scotland . 
  the americans felt that legislation such as the tax on tea harmed them disproportionately ; the same is true of the poll tax during the thatcher years , and the upcoming welfare reform . 
  there are serious political issues in scotland and the uk right now , and i 'm not sure how you can claim to understand that if you do n't live here . 
  i 've no idea where the data came from ; i somewhat naively assumed it was coming from the irish census . 
  i only highlighted abortion as a potentially contentious issue if we formed a political union because you can somewhat freely get an abortion in scotland , whereas i 'm aware of the `` endangered health '' criterion in ireland . 
  in that case , absolutely ; it 'd be great to see more interaction between all of these isles , and i think the dissolution of the british state could facilitate that . 
  perhaps the british-irish council could become a council of these isles , facilitating co-operation between scotland , ireland , and what remains of the uk . 
  supranational unions are usually a good thing . 
  also , i only mentioned the catholicism in light of things like the protests over abortion , and the ongoing sectarian problems in northern ireland ( which may or may not be relevant ) . 
  i was also kind of going off [ the wikipedia page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_ireland#religion ) , which claims that 84.2 % of your population identifies as catholic , compared to [ about 15.9 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_scotland ) of scotland 's . 
  that 's hilarious , coming from an american . 
  surely you learnt the history of your country , which also `` unnecessarily '' sought independence from westminster ? 
  i 'd love for scotland to join schengen and * eventually * the eurozone , but it is n't going to happen anytime soon ; we 're going to want to maintain the common travel area with the rest of the uk for as long as possible , since we have these deeply ingrained cultural ties , and that means having to refuse schengen for now . 
  my mother is german and my father is scottish . 
  do i embody the germanic-gael race divide ? 
  i do n't see much value in having a political union made up of the celtic countries . 
  you 'd have the same problems as the uk has today - i 'm not sure that scotland and ireland are , for example , ready to agree on key policies . 
  plus , with ireland 's rampant catholicism , and scottish catholics claiming institutional discrimination , you 're potentially reigniting sectarian tension . 
  it 's definitely the possibility for something new and different . 
  westminster uses first-past-the-post for elections to the house of commons , and has an unelected upper chamber in the house of lords . 
  holyrood , which is scotland 's parliament , uses the additional member system so that seat distribution closely resembles vote distribution , and has no upper chamber . 
  it 's a much more democratic parliament , and given that we just saw attempts to reform the westminster electoral system and to abolish the house of lords utterly fail , this is pretty much the only way we 'll be out of that self-serving , bipartisan system . 
  apparently not . 
  then again , this was at the time of the new # 20 note designs , so perhaps they work now . 
  til . 
  thank you . 
  i 'm never quite sure what the welsh and northern irish assemblies have say over . 
  why would england want to rebuild hadrian 's wall ? 
  the whole thing is within their modern borders . 
  really ? 
  i was under the impression that the health bill applied to both england and wales . 
  youth culture has very little to do with politics , though . 
  i remember having a row with an oyster card machine in london because i had to top up my card and the only cash i had was a scottish # 20 note . 
  by the time i got it topped up , it was rush hour :(, 
  better start as soon as possible , then !, 
  i travelled to london , newcastle , and blackpool a fair number of times last year alone , not to mention the years prior to that , despite never living in england , wales , or northern ireland . 
  that wo n't change in an independent scotland . 
  scotland would n't be fending for itself in the big bad european parliament anyway , given the make-up of parliamentary groups in it . 
  it 's quite possibly we 'll wind up with our meps in the same group as the uk 's ( or at least a significant number of each in the same group ) , in which case we 'd be fighting alongside the uk for similar things , with a louder voice !, 
  mutually beneficial  and , of course , we 'd maintain the right to withdraw from the eu if it stopped being beneficial to the scottish people . 
  essentially : i am content for an independent scotland to exist in today 's eu . 
  i can not say for how long that will continue , but i 'm reassured by our right to leave the eu altogether ; the eu is a much more voluntary union than the uk is . 
  thanks for your good wishes . 
  ** edit : ** accidentally wrote `` would '' instead of `` would n't '' . 
  i have no doubt that if york had a consistently strong independence movement , such as a third of the population campaigning for it for generations , it would be noticed . 
  this is what scotland has ( for historical reasons ) . 
  given that scotland already has independent institutions and a separate legal system , among other things , it is altogether easier to divide the uk along the scotland-england border . 
  york independence ? 
  you 'd have to create a new york nhs , a new york parliament , and so on . 
  plus , you 'd have to ask the question : does york have a sustainable economy ? 
  scotland does , hence why independence is a viable option . 
  obviously , this rules out independence for , say , the city of dundee - it would likely suffer economically as a city-state , so it 's better off as part of scotland . 
  ( note : that was an example , i ca n't say for sure whether or not dundee 's economy is sustainable . ), 
  less eurosceptic than england , probably because we are n't as reliant on , say , banks that suffer under eu regulations . 
  irvine welsh ( author of trainspotting ) argues that we would have * greater * cultural unity with the rest of the uk and ireland after independence , as it would no longer be compromised by the friction and tension caused by our political disagreements  ** edit : ** [ here 's his piece ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/scottish-power-irvine-welsh-makes-an-impassioned-personal-plea-for-an-independent-scotland-8473639.html ) , and [ here is the guardian 's take on it ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/jan/10/scottish-independence-british-irvine-welsh ) . 
  it was originally published on bella caledonia , but i 've linked to the independent 's re-published version because it has better sub-editing ( punctuation and the like ) . 
  i 'm not in favour of a european superstate , but i do strongly support further european integration of the kind that the uk 's government continues to resist . 
  in the independence negotiations , i 'm largely concerned only by the euro , which i do n't want scotland to embrace right off the bat , and certainly not until the end of the eurozone crisis .
