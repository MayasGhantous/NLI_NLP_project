  they only hate porn in front of the grandkids, 
  i despise it . 
  i could be riding unicorns if it were n't for france ? 
  are you honestly telling a brit that france is why he ca n't have nice things ? 
  i just became a member of the agricultural reform lobby . 
  i 'm not up to speed on the agricultural reform lobby . 
  what 're their major proposals ? 
  my gripe with this is that i really like dates . 
  are you saying lots of millionaires are moving to germany ? 
  any links to source data ? 
  i 'd like to see the original questions . 
  in french if possible . 
  edit : also , i wonder what generation identity think about doxxing . 
  two !!, 
  i 'm sitting pretty on 3 . 
  if we count chav as a language . 
  which we should as it is so far removed from english . 
  oh , / r/europe . 
  just when i was beginning to change my mind about you all . 
   we should be putting our efforts towards reforming the eu how are we going to do that ? 
  we have no influence in the eu . 
  we 're a bank card when times get tough , but if you think cameron has as much weight as merkel and hollande you 're dreaming . 
  there are benefits to being in the eu but we 'll never be a leader in it . 
  it 's germany and france 's baby now . 
  has been for a while . 
  did or did not ? 
   the european project i just do n't see the point of the european project . 
  do we really need it ? 
  i can kind of see the benefit of the eu , the schengen agreement , and a free/open market , but the european project ^ tm seems intent on full federation eventually , and i do n't see how that can possibly be a good thing . 
  and what would it even look like ? 
  german-elected european cabinet members approving the irish budget which will affect people they knows nothing about in a culture they only know from stereotypes and a brief 100 page memo which he skim read ? 
  the belgian-born european culture secretary overseeing how french culture develops and grows ? 
  spanish-born health ministers pushing for health reforms in italy , which the french and polish agree on , but the germans are n't so sure but might be swayed , and the italians are against it ? 
  how can that possibly be a good idea ? 
  we do n't take ourselves seriously and we 're tolerant towards gays . 
  there 's no place i 'd rather be . 
  even when you do consider language , that does n't really negate the fact that we are picking up american ideas and brands much quicker . 
  i love the mentality . 
  `` my ideas make me more enlightened and mature . 
  you are clearly still a juvenile delinquent . 
  you really think money leaving the country is a good idea ? 
  you still have n't answered my question . 
  when the millionaires move out , what then ? 
  when tax revenues are down because the money isnt there to be taxed , then what ? 
  wave the flag of socialism a little harder ? 
  clearly that will solve the problem . 
  well then you 're a mug . 
  tax them 90 % for trying to move ? 
  seriously , the shit this site comes up with is pathetic . 
  what 's a foreign language ? 
  just kidding . 
  i speak french as well . 
  the us thinks our food is bad ? 
  excuse me while i cry my lean physique to sleep . 
  you 're honestly saying you 'd rather have none of their taxes instead of some ? 
  then where 's the money gon na come from ? 
  the working poor ? 
  good one . 
  instead of having more money , you 've now got less than you had before . 
  how is this good ? 
   on this website . 
  ftfy . 
  did n't you know that redditors all have phds in life , the universe and everything ? 
  the world would be perfect is everyone was like ~ ~ me ~ ~ us . 
  america . 
  switzerland . 
  london . 
  the caymans . 
  there are a few places that rich people like . 
  simple fact : rich people are good for an economy . 
  what they do n't pay in tax they invest in markets , what they do n't invest in markets they leave in banks boosting credit bases , what they do n't leave in banks they spend on commercial and retail goods . 
  chase them out at your peril . 
  and before anyone says tax havens , if you 're really petty enough to deprive your markets , your banks and your high street in the name of idealism then quite frankly you deserve the breadline . 
  which you 'll be on eventually . 
  cutting your nose off to spite your face is not a smart way to fix the economy . 
  is it me , or has the mood changed in recent months ? 
   and the world writes off the debt that ai n't gon na happen, 
  i really ca n't think of anything worse than a political pick 'n' mix , but make sure you stay alive when the world collapses so you can voice your opinion at the nwo forums in 2021 after ww3 . 
  people naturally divide themselves up into ideas and values 1 . 
  have open discussion about ideas and values 1 . 
  every so often , hold a poll to see which ideas and values are most prevelant 1 . 
  those ideas and values are used as a blueprint until the next poll 1 . 
  repeat steps 2-4, 
  do n't forget guys , we have to spend our way out of this . 
   terribly, 
  you 're welcome . 
  pretty sure what you jus said was appeasement , not wisdom . 
  you all sound surprised . 
  i do n't understand why . 
  but no because rich people, 
  to take anyone at their word while they campaign is so ignorant . 
  who cares what they say ?
