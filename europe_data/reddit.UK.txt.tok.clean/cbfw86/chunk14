  it will be extending the rights of married couples so that all relationships can be recognised equally in the eyes of the state . 
  we laugh at polygamists and call them weird , and have the occasional tv documentary about mormons and it 's offshoots on some piss-poor channel struggling for viewings [ looking at you , channel 5 ] , where we 'll get a big bowl of popcorn and watch it like some kind of socially accepted voyeurism ( ` look at them . 
  and they 're *** ok *** with this domestic arrangement . 
  * white * people !, 
  living in these kinds of relationships . 
  in the *** west *** . 
  ' ) , but it will be accepted in mainstream western culture within 50 years . 
  i think they 're referring to euroscepticism . 
   the uk is not the only member state able to talk about reforms . 
  seems that way . 
   faith fundie, 
  in the eyes of the modern age , he did n't do very much . 
  it really would n't be hard at all to paint him as an ideological moron and maybe a womanising son of a bitch to boot . 
  who knows . 
  but then if you look at life back then and how government worked he was arguably great in the sense that he made england strong in the eyes of its neighbours and kept the country united ( as opposed to a possible breakdown into tribes and clans like the golden age of the celts ) and that in turn had knock-on effects on the rest of history . 
  if we 'd been a small island with lots of different countries squabbling all the time we may not have achieved the things we have achieved in the last nine or ten centuries . 
  it probably would ' t be very hard to argue that without a strong national identity the british isles would have been trophies for the continent , each taking their turn in seizing it . 
  who the hell knows . 
  but like you , i 'm no historian . 
  he could have been a total dick . 
  i would n't say boadicea is a hero . 
  she 's only really known because she was a woman and stuck it to the romans . 
  ( i think . ), 
  richard the lionheart is more popular than her by a long long way . 
  it is hard to make predictions , yes , and i 'll make my own prediction that that other prediction is wrong ( so meta ) . 
  but i figured that one smart-assed remark ( `` they might be back to normal within 20 years . '' ), 
  deserved another . 
  look on the bright side ; you 're not out of sync with the guardian , no matter how bombastically your attempt at wit failed . 
  britain is recovering . 
   implying i implied otherwise, 
  yeah sure, 
  they 're all ego stroking . 
  look at france 's coins . 
  are . 
  france . 
  after studying it at university i ca n't take anything the eu says about fishing seriously . 
  granted this was 10 years ago , but there is still no evidence that they 've changed tack ( at least of that which i am aware ) . 
  stand against her . 
  dooo-it !, 
  dooo-it !, 
  dooo-it !, 
  dooo-it !, 
  daniel hannan can be an arse most of the time but he does have a certain flair for rhetoric which can sometimes draw a wry smile . 
  remember when france lined the douane along the italian border and sent legal migrants back the way they came ? 
  viviane reding and / r/europe do n't remember either . 
  she 's from luxembourg , you dolt . 
  after her little shpeel about `` we want a united states of europe '' the other day it is most unsurprising to me that in a quick fix of good pr she has gone after the eu 's favourite boogeyman : david cameron . 
  jog on , viviane . 
   we want a united states of europe the use of the word `` we '' should send shivers down everyone 's spine . 
  to whom is she referring exactly ? 
  her constituents ? 
  i 'm quite sure the vice president of the european commission has no constituents and was put there by her politician friends . 
  this is a clear example of how detached the political class can become , and as much as i have moved away from euroscepticism since subing to / r/europe , this only makes me more inclined to agree with politicians who say that the eu is facing a crisis of legitimacy . 
  this is delusion pure and simple , and the fact that this desire held by the political class is seen as the `` best weapon against the eurosceptics '' makes it even worse . 
  it 's like hungry dogs baying for more power . 
  the political destiny of a continent should not be seen as some crude form of chess with people you disagree with . 
  chilling . 
  because you end up with one of the most corrupt , polarising political systems in the world . 
  07/01/14 - the day / r/europe became self-aware . 
  yeah sure but you 're talking generations of development initiatives , the first two of those ballsing everything up beyond all recognition . 
  thank you , fact checker , 
  i 'd argue the main risk is the rise of the right wing . 
  politics gets dragged to the right by die-hard libertarians and nationalists who refuse to negotiate ( think edl , bnp and fn , and the disturbing number of votes they manage to pull in ) . 
  progress is ( in the round ) hampered . 
  immigrations not a bad thing ( my wife is an immigrant so this is more than just headlines and a ` i 've got a black friend ' thing to me ; i have substantial skin in the game ; either she is an immigrant or i am , and that will never not be the case ) , and one of my favourite journalists in the uk is medhi hasan , i think he 's very clever and perceptive ( despite his flaws ) , but the simple fact is that you 've got to get immigration right else the shit can hit the fan before you realise . 
  as i write this i am aware that i am the first uk flair . 
  if sweden keeps this up it will turn sour . 
  that 's not to say sweden will fall apart , but the uk is full of hard-right-wing nut jobs and not-so-closet racists always banging on about how pubs are closing down because of immigrants , and primary schools where the prime language is polish instead of english , benefit scroungers , immigrants with a better standard of living than natives , etc. , etc. , ad nauseum . 
  it will make things awkward for a while , and then you 'll get uber-liberals saying , ' *** can you fact check that , please *** !? ', 
  and then you 're arguing about the argument and nothing advances while all the time more immigrants are flowing in placing more strain on already strained infrastructure . 
  the situation is pretty bleak here , but maybe its just the general tone of the news deployed to sell copy . 
  all that said , i thought the number was huge because they took in a load of syrian refugees ? 
  or am i confusing headlines ? 
  to be perfectly fair , can you think of a comments section which is n't dire ? 
  it 's not like the guardian cranks out ever-increasingly euphoric renditions of the universal declaration of human rights on a 18-times daily basis . 
  hm , actually ... 
  quel gossip juicy . 
  wot, 
  the circlejerk . 
  men in black , 1997, 
  brb . 
  going to amsterdam to commit crime . 
  do you have to stipulate gender every time ? 
  thanks , germany . 
  i said i was here for the circlejerk . 
  there are lots going on in this thread . 
  it 's a gourmet buffet . 
  i 'm here for the circlejerk ? 
  i find that to be a bit of a double standard to be honest . 
  david cameron gets lacerated on a daily basis for not fixing things and francois hollande gets off lightly because it 's out of his hands ? 
  it can only be / r/europe . 
  let 's give the socialist an easy ride because were all on the left . 
  this is how it works in paris . 
  everyone knows it . 
  decent comment . 
  however you ca n't possibly be a believer in hollande ? 
  the man is useless . 
  it has taken him far too long to even get to this point . 
  if bitcoin has taught me anything it is that blowing your own trumpet and telling people to get hype about your product is now a viable business strategy in the age of social media . 
  it was only a matter of time before someone told a government to give it a try too .
