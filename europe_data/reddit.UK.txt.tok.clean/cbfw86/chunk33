  why are bankers ' bonuses even worthy of politicians ' time ? 
  yeah but we were right . 
  is n't it self-defeating to your argument to use this as circlejerk porn to laugh at our approach to the eu ? 
  ` the british did n't believe in europe then and they do n't believe in it now , har ha - wait ... . no its fine . 
  and tidy anti-semitism has been replaced by islamaphobia . 
  europe has come a long way . 
  just because it 's the official view does n't mean it 's not propaganda . 
  if anything it means it is more likely to be propaganda . 
  that 's not important . 
  what 's important is that we 're so progressive that we 're tolerant of nazism and encourage anti-semitic jokes . 
  now upvote it , you filthy conservative . 
  i wonder of that 's how jews feel sometimes . 
  we 're better together . 
  do n't leave us :'(, 
  french . 
  there is always an exception which confirms the rule . 
  i was wondering when the french would join this discussion . 
  my wife 's french . 
  your country both enthrals and frustrates me . 
  i love it . 
  when islam has disappeared and arab nations are ready to be more like us ? 
  came here to say , ` get over ourselves . ', 
  close enough . 
  french company just got named by french state . 
  exports to  10 countries . 
  * burp * and that 's the end of that chapter . 
  but , in an age of self-made platforms were people think their opinion is sacrosanct and becoming increasingly political-savy , how long will representative democracy be the status quo ? 
  it 's very academic . 
  fyi . 
  marriage is very child-focused . 
  the vows you make are all about the family unit . 
  it 's culturally encouraged and emphasised . 
  ` remain ' implies that we 're already there ... 
  all the cool banks are doing it . 
  in honesty , though , that 's a remarkably naive thing for hollande to say . 
  this guy is full of bad ideas . 
  it 's staggering . 
  i do n't think anyone expects it to be endless . 
  because banning cigarettes would result in the birthing of la vi r\u00e9publique . 
  the scandinavians [ read : everybody else in europe ] , however , will take a similar measure on the chin like team players . 
  ups : eu gets cheap oil . 
  downs : norway loses a lot of profits from exporting oil . 
  and reduced sovereignty . 
  would n't that be an almighty spanner in the works of the eu . 
  pretty terrifying . 
  not progressives and socialists . 
  did you forget where you were or something ? 
  i think if a kid wants to know , for the sake of medical history etc. , i 'm all for that . 
  but once you hand over the cup and get your money that 's that from the father 's perspective . 
  ca n't say i like the sound of this . 
  if i guy has weak swimmers and he and his wife use a donor they 've got to deal with the donor coming round and telling the kid his dad 's not his real dad ? 
  just because the donor wanted to spank into a cup for a tenner and was curious about what happened next ? 
  e : clarity, 
  dude !, 
  nsfw tags !, 
   for some people the specialise in being stupid [ sic ], 
  they 're not completely unrelated . 
  both are about immigration . 
  c - ... can we join in ? 
  it shows uk europhobes that the eu is something which throws it 's weight around like a stroppy teenage prat when it is unhappy . 
  e : ` selfish norway ' ? 
  really ? 
  * really ? 
  * `` moooooooooooooooommmmm !, 
  norway wo n't let me play with the super nintendo !, 
  you 're not aloud to borrow any of my cds any more . 
  you 'll have to pay me . '', 
  the neo-liberal discourse on the role of the state . 
  do n't worry . 
  the eu will impose it soon enough . 
  thank you . 
  but the ` europe 's scaredy-cat ' one was . 
  ca n't help but notice a trend . 
  hague was hilarious , mate . 
  in fairness he could afford to be . 
  he did n't really need to care . 
  he once said that he was doing the ` night shift ' . 
  no one could take on blair . 
  harman : `` that 's your problem , is n't it , william . 
  you 're always cracking jokes . '', 
  hague : `` your problem , harriet , is that all your jokes are on the front bench . '', 
  ( or words to that effect ), 
  did n't work for cameron . 
  will it work for blair ? 
  that 's just spin . 
  having economic and social policy dictated by a majority opinion which you do not share is not , in any way , `` pooled '' sovereignty . 
  so you 're saying we should just varnish over the truth and tell misleading lies ? 
   ** european integration was a fundamentally political and ideological project ** . 
  it was a pragmatic construction designed to achieve the utopia ( my colleague kalypso nicolaidis calls this the eutopia ) of peace in europe through ties that bind and become too costly to sever , ** in exchange for some relinquishing of sovereignty ** . 
  how anyone can possibly think that relinquishing sovereignty in pursuit of ideology is a good idea is simply beyond me . 
  it would n't even work . 
  you 'd just end up with a scenario where the biggest country with the biggest economy get 's its way on everything , and the little guy has to take policy orders from said country . 
  economic strength would become -- as always -- the defining characteristic of political power in the eutopia , ideology be damned . 
  but that could never possibly happen . 
  ever . 
  surely . 
  should have kept it classy , man . 
  i agree with what you say 100 % but the potty mouth undermines your delivery . 
  because waging wars is always so cheap , and the books never have to settled eventually . 
  what is ?
