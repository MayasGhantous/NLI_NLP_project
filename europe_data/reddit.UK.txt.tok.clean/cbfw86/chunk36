  all it really shows is that there are more people in the uk who have and unfavourable opinion of the eu [ in it 's present form , it might be worth mentioning ] , than there are people who have a favourable opinion . 
  i would be very interested to see the questions which were asked and how the surveyors determined `` favourable '' and `` unfavourable '' views . 
  at the moment that map is just pure spin , with bold vibrant colours to boot . 
  i love it when redditors get butthurt and start splitting hairs slinging ad homenems around . 
  i do n't care mate . 
  you seem to be assuming that because i 'm anti-ftt i 'm anti-all regulation , which is another strawman . 
  try again !, 
  read the speech instead of the headlines . 
  the eu as it is is a slow grinding bloc . 
  repatriating powers would create a network of autonomous , lively , sovereign nations with their own identities , much more capable of the flexibility necessary to stay on top of the global economy . 
  or would you rather continue as we are and see all the economic projections ( eg losing a third of economic productivity ) come true ? 
  i love it when some educated opinions in political journalism from some of the most reputable sources around get downvoted here just because they do n't give / r/europe 's federalist agenda-pushers a free dick massage . 
   so , no taxes , no regulations , ** no worker protection , just a race to the bottom ** ? 
  ** foxconn-style ** or maybe ** child labor ** ? 
  ** straw man alert ** child labour ? 
  wtf ? 
  got a bit over excited with that one . 
  when did i say the uk contributed too much ? 
  all i 'm saying is that we , as a national economy , were investing in the eurozone and when the eu game had difficulty we put more skin in it . 
   do you at least get the irony of accusing me of trusting an economist , but blindly following the simplest economic model yourself ? 
  it 's not irony . 
  you trust the sophistry of an descriptive academic who touts him/herself as a prescriptive , and i trust basic common sense . 
  and what are you on about ? 
  you 've completely ignored what i said about latam ( latin america ) and asia . 
  in 20 years time the economic output o the eu will have dropped by a third and lost to these emerging markets . 
  is now the time to slap a tax on financial transactions ? 
  even then , on what moral basis does broader society have a right to dip it 's hands into the transactions of private businesses ? 
  it 's bizarre . 
  we saw one of our neighbours in trouble and we helped out . 
  are you honestly going to cry about the fact that we did it out of pragmatism instead of idealism ? 
  so you 're saying that in an eu democracy only consenting opinions are recognised by the status quo ? 
  did you read the speech ? 
   i know that the united kingdom is sometimes seen as an argumentative and rather strong-minded member of the family of european nations . 
   and it 's true that our geography has shaped our psychology . 
   we have the character of an island nation -- independent , forthright , passionate in defence of our sovereignty . 
   we can no more change this british sensibility than we can drain the english channel . 
   and because of this sensibility , we come to the european union with a frame of mind that is more practical than emotional . 
   for us , the european union is a means to an end -- prosperity , stability , the anchor of freedom and democracy both within europe and beyond her shores - not an end in itself . 
   we insistently ask : how ? 
  why ? 
  to what end ? 
  already married ( to a ` real european ' as it happens ) . 
  can we hold hands as brothers ? 
  if only for today ? 
  i feel the exact same way . 
  is any investment ever made out of goodwill ? 
  i doubt it . 
  if we get accepted to table as ` real europeans ' then i imagine there will be no need for a referendum . 
  i believe cameron when he says he wants to stay in the eu . 
  i see no reason to disbelieve him . 
  lost cause , mate . 
  the anti-uk sentiment in this thread is so ironic it hurts . 
  pm makes a speech saying he wants britain to be accepted fully at the table and ` true europeans ' in ` real european countries ' unleash the hounds and pick apart any contribution we 've ever made , somehow implicitly insisting that we 're not ` real eu members ' . 
   no [ t ] the uk state , the uk banks were investing in irish banks . 
  splitting hairs , mate . 
  so you 're saying we were investing in the ez as well as helping to bail it out ? 
  as a non-ez country ? 
  look at us go . 
  utopias do n't exist . 
  sounds like an energy drink . 
  also , an in/out referendum would be unfair at the moment , as the lib dems ca n't support it at all . 
  it ca n't be done in the name of the coalition . 
  it would have to be done under a fully conservative government . 
  that 's actually quite modest of them . 
  i expected worse . 
  thanks for the free spin , germany !, 
  pretty sure we coughed up a fair amount for greece . 
  and ireland . 
  you put your trust in economists rather than basic observations of human greed ? 
  businesses wo n't care . 
  if they can boost revenues by doing business elsewhere then they 'll go and do it . 
  latam and asia are booming right now . 
  what the hell makes you think there will be any incentive to stay in emea if the eu slaps more tax on business purely for doing business there ? 
  they wont care . 
  they 'll just leave to hong kong and shanghai . 
  it 's all the city 's fault . 
  somehow . 
  if only the ec had control of the city this could all have been averted . 
  somehow . 
   regardless of where you stand on the issue : it 's not comparable . 
  i see you 've never met a big-businessman . 
  snow . 
  it 's quite humiliating . 
  where did this whole debate come from anyway ? 
  well there goes french scientific research . 
  francois hollande keeps on keeping on . 
  what do you know , you stupid brit ? 
  * downvote *, 
  to all the people in this thread who think it 's not going to happen : why do you keep banging on about it so much ? 
  your use of the word `` we '' in direct reference to a war concerns me . 
  i felt the vatican label for britain was wrong . 
  it should have gone with `` aggressive secularism '' . 
  to be perfectly honest , i think you 're overlooking the fact that wet africa is to france as the middle east is to the usa . 
  they have keen interests in it 's development and/or it 's day-to-day affairs for their own economic gain . 
  also , i get the impression that this is hollande flexing his muscles to show the world 's leaders that he 's not a weakling leftist . 
  he has too much to prove after his recent political defeats and the general malcontent in france ( approval ratings sub 50 % ) for those things to not be a part of the equation of what 's going on here . 
  you 're a dipshit, 
  but it directly mentions children , and stipulates that , for the good of the social contract , married couples will create a space to raise children and give then all they need utility they are autonomous . 
  no other state ( that i know of ) directly links marriage and reproduction in such a way . 
  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaha,
