  why should i trust the newspaper more than the experts ? 
  what if the newspaper was the daily mail ? 
  prosecuting offensive tweets just makes sense . 
  if i screamed in a polish immigrant 's face that he 's scum and should leave the country then i 'd spend time in jail . 
  just because it 's indirect on the internet does n't make it instantly protected from prosecution . 
  banana man was cool . 
  i ca n't imagine that potato man would be as entertaining . 
  sorry people i know use the phrase more broadly . 
  manifest destiny was the idea that the usa was divinely supported to spread from coast to coast . 
  it has a collective meaning , but i also consider there to be an individual meaning . 
  the days of plonking your flag in the ground and suddenly owning the encompassing 10 acres , or whatever it was , was a part of colonising the desert in the heyday of md , but it 's also indicative of the idea that every man and his gun is free and the government should piss off . 
  the two are n't very far different . 
  pff . 
  the reality is that america , as a largely religious state , is fanatically obsessed with free speech . 
  the right to offend is a holy right ( or perhaps a rite ) in the usa , whereas many people i 've met in the uk would rather just get on with being a love and enjoying their family and friends than worry about what fringe thing they 'd never dream of saying ca n't be said because of whatever reason . 
  you say censorship causes the troubles , i say free speech gave hitler all the platform he needed to rise to power through a propaganda machine . 
  a balance is needed , and given that the internet has changed the game in how we communicate i see no problem with reviewing what constitutes free speech and what constitutes illegal speech . 
  i ca n't walk up to you and verbally abuse you in the street . 
  i ca n't eviscerate you so disparagingly that you kill yourself . 
  if you disagree , please submit a 500 word comment on why bullying gay kids is ok . you seem to take a slightly fanatical approach to free speech , and seem to be very quick to judge another country 's / other countries ' ways of doing things , so i 'll assume that you believe in free speech at all costs . 
  so defend homophobia . 
  go on . 
  off you go . 
  a few common sense laws around speech do not north korea make . 
  that 's part of a wider issue that america has with government at all . 
  you still have n't shed the mentality of manifest destiny . 
  you do n't trust your government on things they should be distrusted on , ok , but you also do n't trust your government enough to have high taxes and strong social services . 
  a cleverdick who likes to twist being called out on tactlessness and turn it into a bloodchilling shrill that they 're being censored . 
  we did n't have the internet during the troubles did we , you bellend . 
  and do n't use other countries ' tragedies against them to evoke an emotional response . 
  you look like a prick . 
  it 's not being pedantic and contrived though , is it ? 
  there has always been a trade off . 
  the terms of the trade off are subject to change as society changes . 
  free speech and security do n't have the same trade off that they used to have . 
  the game has changed . 
   kinda, 
  i 'm having one of those days at the moment where throwing it all in and becoming an animal based vigilante seems like a good career move . 
  three and a half days till i 'm on leave . 
  we do n't have free speech and never have . 
  since civilisation came to be , we have not had free speech . 
  interesting, 
  i would agree, 
  people do n't learn the right lessons from history . 
  they see football yobs and the edl waving the english flag and feel guilty about a colonialist past that was over a century ago . 
  so does sauerkraut, 
  nothing says slow friday afternoon like kicking up dust over the british electoral system . 
  people are saying this is a standoff between the legislature and the judiciary . 
  is that a fair assessment ? 
  is there a breakdown for lay people who did n't study physics or chemistry past the age of 17 ? 
  not if i fiddle with the kernel enough first, 
  using a computer and having your data mined . 
  welcome to the digital data cabal formerly known as the tech industry . 
  it 's been the business model for internet companies since the year dot . 
  it 's just taken a very long time for people to catch on . 
  data is the currency of the future . 
  they 'd track down the girls and kill them . 
  omg . 
  that is the best burn i 've seen in a while . 
  a ha ha ha . 
  let us go piss into a urinal standing up and feel superior . 
  still ? 
  nice third wheel, 
  hawt, 
  not really . 
  i do n't really know anything about ireland . 
  i know they 're a friendly bunch , tend to hate britain and do n't like potatoes , but most people i know do n't make fun of them past school playground jokes . 
  i guess those jokes have become so clich\u00e9 that they 've entered the realm of ` ya mom ' jokes so no one tells them any more . 
  ireland 's alright . 
  we mock the french senseless because it stops them gallivanting around with delusions of grandeur . 
  someone 's got to do it . 
   france  punch up u wot m8 ? 
  then they 'd take the bulk of the gulf stream . 
  would that be good or bad for britain ? 
  good work , everybody . 
  let 's take five and get back into it from the top after the break . 
  does he act dependently ? 
  that explains gerard depardieu . 
  but when then you 'd spend lots of money building a society which does n't exist because you 've maximised civilian casualties by railing to spend money on reducing them . 
  swiss army in shock incursion into foreign soil for the first time in over 200 years . 
  country | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- uk | greece | britain | eu | europe | germany | government | countries | money | ** france ** | | | france | france ^ ( lol ) | greece | europe | germany | money | eu | countries | government | debt | pay | really | ** britain ** why do n't you like us as much as we like you , france ? 
  why wo n't you love me ? 
   white, 
  not really . 
  they think society should be made up of white nuclear families . 
  where 's the paradox ? 
  pff 16th century ottomans . 
  bunch of frauds . 
  because that talent creates its own work through entrepreneurship and innovation . 
  it 's ok for them to go through a muslim area , it 's just not ok to go through a muslim area and expect to not get shot . 
  how is greece supposed to make it attractive if all the talent is leaving ? 
  what resources are they supposed to use to build the economy and carry out change management in businesses ? 
  it is wishful thinking but this is as good as it 's every going to get for them . 
  anything else would look like capitulation . 
  this could - * could * - lead to fifa stripping russia of the world cup without making it look like it capitulated to social media pressure . 
  it 's an opportunity for them to do it on their own terms . 
  this is getting insane . 
  conservatives do n't mind it because obama was very flattering of cameron . 
  kippers are pretty pissed . 
  the eu looks at us and sees what it wants to see .
