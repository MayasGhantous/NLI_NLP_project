  that is remarkably ignorant . 
  and i 'm quite certain that most americans would back me up on that . 
  your comment is bizarre . 
  what 's your point ? 
  that 's the thing . 
  a lot of eu federalists seem to not get that . 
  hey , man , this is your project . 
  if you want to show the world the strength of that solidarity by allowing the euro to turn greece into europe 's own somalia then you go right ahead . 
  just keep in mind that california does n't tell montana to get stuffed when it needs a bit of help in a federal super state . 
   i feel europe has proven itself a far more delicate union than what we would like to think . 
  this is no secret unless you have allowed the wool of the media to be pulled over your eyes . 
  it was always that way ,, 
  kek, 
  seriously . 
  this shit needs to be serialised . 
  they should just stick a periscope in there and let people tune into the livestream . 
  it is becoming increasingly apparent to any and all who are following this that germany are only in this for germany . 
  france at least seems to give a shit about the general health of europe . 
  germany need to come up with something to show they care . 
  begrudgingly agreeing to helping your ` friends ' and ` allies ' is transparent and even children can see through that behaviour . 
  not-so-subtle subliminal messaging, 
  military technology is so awesome . 
  there 's the just the minor inconvenience that it involves killing people . 
  but why show the world you have a bullet when you do n't have gun !, 
  they 're bluffing !, 
  the end is upon us !, 
  ** america : ** `` do you have a nuclear program ? '', 
  ** israel : ** `` no . '', 
  ** a : ** `` we have these keyhole satellite photos . 
  i 'm going to put them here on the table . 
  do you have a nuclear program ? '', 
  ** i : ** `` those are photo-shopped . '', 
  ** a : ** `` here 's a live feed of one of your facilities . 
  we placed some cameras in the hills under cover of darkness . 
  do you have a nuclear program ? '', 
  ** i : ** `` that is the west bank . '', 
  ** a : ** `` it 's not he west bank . 
  here we have a voice recording of ariel sharon . 
  * click * `` we have a nuclear program . '', 
  * click * do you have a nuclear program ? '', 
  ** i : ** `` no . '', 
  ** a : ** `` we know you are lying and we will stop sending you money if you do n't tell us the truth . '', 
  ** i : ** `` we have a nuclear energy program . '', 
  ** a : ** `` that 's better . '', 
  ** i : ** `` and we would like to attend the nuclear warhead summit meetings from now on . '', 
  ** a : ** `` son of a bitch ! '', 
  it 's true . 
  now after reading that comment i need a drink . 
   if i were to rank eu governments by how much their governments have contributed to the eu effort , i think that germany would not do badly at all . 
  depends on how far back in history you go . 
  if we 're being blunt . 
  that does n't change the fact that it was done , nor does it change the fact that we may need to start thinking about communism in greece . 
  perhaps we can play you a violin ? 
   want to let greece on its own the fact that young europeans are even considering that says everything you need to hear about the fate of the european project if left in the hands of the young . 
  hollande is seen as inept and incompetent in the uk . 
  when people think about him at all . 
  it has nothing to do with that . 
  they 're the biggest player in europe and are routinely the one 's calling the shots . 
  they 're there to be shot at . 
  another minute in detroit . 
  i 'd rather they used x-com than star trek . 
  `` this mission is highly dangerous and it is likely that one of us will be killed . 
  the landing team will consist of myself , mr spock , dr bones , and ensign ricky . '', 
  `` ah crap . '', 
  by the look of her she rules out haircuts as a rule of thumb, 
  i was n't kidding about intimidation . 
  i dated the daughter of an armed cop . 
  he had some wicked stories about smashing car windows in and rattling shotguns in people 's faces . 
  he went his entire career without pulling the trigger outside the training ranges . 
  he was at hungerford . 
  really interesting career stories . 
  positioning and intimidation is everything . 
  we spend hours training them on x-com and make them watch batman movies twice a week . 
  scotland , do n't fail me now !, 
  i would agree completely . 
  a rare moment of self-deprecation from the french . 
  did n't expect that when i woke up this morning . 
  what do you people think went on in the nsa ? 
  honestly ? 
  i doubt there are that many differences between them . 
  and even though i disagree with him on a lot of things , farage strikes me as the kind of guy who 'd come to your family barbecue and be genuinely pleasant company . 
  i doubt they hold grudges off the floor . 
  i would be surprised if they did n't consider each other friends , even secretly . 
  `` it 's the european parliament . 
  bottoms up . '', 
  and as a percentage of gdp is was what ? 
  i agree completely . 
  germany 's overzealousness has fucked everyone . 
  again . 
  let germany pay this time like it did n't last time . 
   60 % of germany 's debt was written off in 1953 probably the smartest thing he could have done . 
  if the poorer counties are going to say ` why should you get away with it while do n't ? 
  ' , tsipras has effectively said , ` why shuold germany get away with it and we do n't ? ', 
  and it 's more than a fair point . 
  who 's the old guy who got a standing ovation ? 
  any idea what he said ? 
  this translating is really quiet , even with right earbud only . 
  or several european countries that an enemy would have to get through first . 
  reddit : asking the important questions, 
  it 's such a wasteful forum .
