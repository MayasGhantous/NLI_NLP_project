  i do n't doubt that it 's a shit situation , but what else is there ? 
  the dole makes people dependent . 
  the poverty trap is a thing , and it 's more than just a myth . 
  i 've seen people fall into it . 
  `` i know that bt isa telecommunications company . 
  what can i say that will make sense ? 
  i like the internet !, 
  and i 've used a lan switchbox at home because the wi-fi signal was n't very good in my bedroom . 
  yeah . 
  yeah . '', 
  we 're talking about people with no experience in the workplace . 
  nil . 
  they will have absolutely zero relevate experience for most of the jobs they 're trying to go to . 
  it would better the demonstrate an ability to work and show up than do nothing . 
  new hires are a big risk to a company . 
  if you ca n't - and most of these young people unfortunately ca n't - demonstrate relevant work experience the least they can do is demonstrate work experience . 
  literally mittler degrass sagan paul , ea ceo of comcast, 
  having recently conducted a few job interviews , seeing some form of commitment to some form of work of volunteer effort is better than seeing  *** july 2014 - present *** - unemployed, 
  butthurt lefties trying to rally support and seek validation after having been decimated at the election, 
  lol have an upvote you tosser, 
  we 're talking about people with zero years full-time experience . 
  what ` tailoring ' can there possibly be ? 
  we 're not talking about people trying to jump from telco to finance or automative to professional services . 
  30 hours a week leaves 10 hours for job hunting . 
  also , having been in the situation of actively looking for a job , all it really amounts to is 2 hours of internet searches , a few phone calls , a few emails , and then playing video games all afternoon . 
  let 's be honest with ourselves . 
  why do n't we ever see this kind of thing posted to / r/europe when it 's from countries other than the uk ? 
  i get what he 's trying to do but that does n't make it any less wrong . 
  it was reflected in the result too . 
  if you look at the bar charts across the constituencies labour were mostly losing to ukip while the tories ploughed to victory and beat labour past the post . 
  it 's amazing that labour did n't see it coming . 
   and carry the french flag with pride shit is this expected ? 
  that might be a deal breaker for me . 
  logic and science hnnnnng, 
  it put skrillex in a job . 
  i volunteer as tribute . 
  jeez . 
  it 's not a hard meme . 
  we 've done that to death . 
  let 's make love instead , bbe, 
  hehehe we only beat france in one column and we 're considered more powerful than them . 
  it 's so pathetic to see redditors try and champion extreme islamists in the name of trying to paint a right wing political party with mud . 
  being seeing as though you want a hiding to nothing here we go . 
    the trojan horsing of the school system for one . 
   how did those schools damage you concretely ? 
  is that how you operate ? 
  if a school is at risk of being undermined and turned into an extremist baby making machine you just sit back and do nothing because it 's not affecting you directly ? 
  you just leave the kids to sit there and be corrupted because you ca n't be bothered to get your hands dirty ? 
  you 're a nasty piece of work , are n't you , / u/visvis ? 
    then there 's abu hamza and his hate speech . 
   you mean the guys who was arrested , sentenced to prison and extradited to the us for more prison time over there ? 
  what should they have done instead ? 
  do your research . 
  it took years to get rid of him exactly because of the hra . 
   limiting freedoms what freedoms ? 
  the freedom to call britain a nation of infidels which much burn in the name of the prophet ? 
  sorry but that 's hate speech . 
  100 % free speech is an ignorant pipe dream . 
  inciting people to violence and hatred simply can not be allowed . 
  these people want to tear up britain 's social contracts and establish sharia law . 
  and you think that in the name of liberal tolerance we should give them the breathing room to try that ? 
  i am quite in favour of civil liberties but i do n't think that they should be limitless . 
  if i moved to the netherlands and started brainwashing people into blowing up schools when would that become illegal ? 
  the preaching hatred part ? 
  would i be liable for the attacks at all if i convince others to do them ? 
  absurd . 
  the trojan horsing of the school system for one . 
  then there 's abu hamza and his hate speech . 
  those two butchers of woolwhich were known to the authorities for years and were allowed to preach hatred and the end of britain basically . 
  maybe if we 'd had better legislation instead of this bullshit `` total tolerance is the only way to beating intolerance '' idea then they would n't have gotten far enough to kill someone . 
  but hey . 
  maybe i 'm wrong . 
  maybe we should sit here and wank off to philosophical paradoxes that are in and of themselves logical fallacies that are good for nothing . 
  social inclusion got us where we are . 
  so all of a sudden we 're going to become dumbfuck leftists who believe that it 's hypocritical to stand up to intolerance in the name of tolerance ? 
  sure lets just lie down and give these extremist bastards all the space they need to sow seeds which will destroy our way of life . 
  that does n't make any sense, 
  spoken like a true student who has no experience in management . 
  do you understand the term ` conflict of interest ' ? 
  if a salesperson goes to one of your competitors are you going to keep him on for the duration of his 3 month notice period while he 's gathering data and information on key customers which s/he can then use to lure them away when they no longer work for you ? 
  gardening leave is an inevitability of the job market . 
  there 's nothing about incompetent management in it . 
  we all hate people on gardening leave , but deep down we all want to get it for ourselves . 
  one of them is deutsche . 
  my brother left last week because they had n't made any serious or significant changes since the crash and everyone on the street knew it . 
  now he 's on three months gardening leave . 
  tosser . 
  west stronk, 
  good . 
  good . 
  let the butthurt flow through you . 
  ** uk ** labour 's chickens came home to roost , and after years of watching them smugly declare that anyone who disagrees with them is a neanderthal , it was deliciously cathartic . 
  lol . 
  what butthurt . 
  i ca n't believe i 'm sitting here trying to argue that a 20 year old is too inexperienced to represent a constituency and i 'm losing . 
  this is absurd . 
  so you think a 20 year old who pays no tuition fees is the right person to voice concerns of english students and graduates ? 
  `` i heard from a friend that tuition fees are hard . '', 
  yeah and what ? 
  if were going by degrees of separation then a 40 year old can hear the same thing from a nephew or niece .
