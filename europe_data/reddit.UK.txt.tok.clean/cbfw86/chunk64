  +72 votes in favour of austerity on / r/europe . 
  what has happened ? 
  is this real life ? 
  turn it into a sentence for terrorists . 
  `` i sentence you to be a matador against 5 bulls at once . '', 
  so they can pillage and burn our public services . 
  `` no one 's ordering our shit we spent fortunes on to build . 
  let 's sue america . '', 
  guilt is a good motivator , and when you 've tried everything and nothing get 's through where else can campaigners go ? 
  did he actually get 97 % of the vote without ballot stuffing ? 
  so it 's legit because the opposition ca n't get their shit together ? 
  2005 to 2013 saw a different french president for the majority of that time frame and completely different political philosophies . 
  let 's not be coy . 
  to take that and assert that france has stayed competitive on the world stage in the past three years is just disingenuous . 
  as to the trade agreements , https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-china-agree-14-billion-of-trade-and-investment-deals https://www.gov.uk/government/news/british-brands-sign-trade-deals-with-india there are more ways than one to skin a cat . 
  and cameron was one of the biggest sponsors of ttip . 
  i honestly do n't understand how anyone can assert that france 's voice on the global stage has n't been damaged by hollande . 
  obviously a nation as big and culturally and historically influential as france is n't going to disappear any time soon , nor should it , but france is nowhere near what it was . 
  will this suit , oh great one who ca n't be arsed to look himself ?

  and what did the meeting in minsk achieve ? 
  oh that 's right . 
  the fighting resumed in like a day . 
  and if you honestly think that hollande has achieved anything in power on the global stage then i do n't know what you 're smoking . 
  france and germany 's relationship has been in decline since sarkozy was booted out . 
  even the champion , prefect and holy paladin of the eu , yae even the veritable die spiegel recognises that . 
  http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/popularity-of-french-president-francois-hollande-in-steep-decline-a-888568.html http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/german-press-french-vote-to-approve-same-sex-marriage-a-896287.html http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/tensions-grow-between-germany-and-france-over-austerity-a-897318.html http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/euro-stability-threatened-if-france-flouts-stability-rules-a-997995.html hollande has been a train wreck through and through , and is only enjoying mildly improved approval ratings as a result of a terrorist attack . 
  but he 's so hopeless that his headlines hall of fame includes driving money out of the country through his 75 % tax rate , breaking up with ze furst gurlfr\u00e8nd , being compared to a child 's gout\u00e9 , and le moment pr\u00e9sident and les guignols are hilarious from start to finish . 
  and yes i am aware of what les guignols aim to achieve and do the same thing to everybody . 
  but even then , * gn\u00e9 h\u00e9 h\u00e9 * and * ou est tu l'emploi * savaged him so badly it bordered on statutory rape . 
  french youths are leaving the country in droves in search of work , ( my brother-in-law among them ) and the indicators of france 's economic health are nothing but horrific to behold . 
  in the meantime , the uk has been securing trade deals with china , india , and the usa , and our economy garners plaudits from around the world ( even french-born christine lagarde of the the imf ) that it is on track to being the largest in europe . 
  you really want to assert that our international voice is weaker than frances over the past few years ? 
  to say nothing of france 's total absence from global politics since the arrival of hollande . 
  they lambast juncker all the time for the situation in luxembourg and say that he 's a danger to european integrity . 
  but of course , i have expected nothing less from / r/europe , the subreddit of the smarmy male left-wing champaign socialist fashionistas . 
  trying to paint a newspaper as something with little regard for their actual track record of who they lacerate and how often . 
  ~ nigel farage, 
  by screencapping it anyway so you see the exact same thing ? 
  way to miss the point . 
  lol . 
  downvotes and he deletes his comment . 
  amazing . 
  should i consider that a win ? 
  boycott the daily fail 's website . 
  100 less clicks makes a difference , i swear . 
  last i checked they call it sangatte . 
  suck it , work !, 
  i thought we were listing contradictions . 
  it 's like playing monopoly with my brother . 
  asshole . 
  end the oppression : grab a pitchfork today, 
  better than that , their slogan is defence of the realm . 
  boris johnson, 
  oh hunger games . 
  how you started out so well , and then threw it all away with mockingjay . 
  i 'll never forgive you , suzanne collins . 
  come on mate . 
  i agree that the economy is picking up in britain but that 's not the issue . 
  the ftse ticker means diddly squat when the gap between the rich and the poor keeps getting bigger and bigger . 
  austerity has punished the poor at every turn . 
  and yet if we start killing everyone with disease x where will we get the incentive to cure disease x ? 
  would n't it just be so much easier if we started killing people with diseases rather than try and find better solutions ? 
  it 's almost as if that 's the meaning of controversial !, 
  germans are actually pretty funny . 
  lol why would i do that ? 
  this is an opportunity to circlejerk about how our precious snowflake opinions are right and the world in it 's conventional wisdom is wrong to think that post-natal abortion is the same thing as murder . 
  cheers boss, 
  point # 2 made me smile . 
  nah bro it 's totally cool . 
  if the quality of life does n't meet my arbitrary standards of what 's an acceptable level of suffering to deal with then it 's totally ok to kill babies . 
  it 's not the article it 's the list . 
  it 's so upper class hipster . 
  what a pretentious list . 
  `` these are the places you need to see when you do europe in your designer clothes and $ 700 sunglasses - which you will need in london , despite the tired clich\u00e9s that so wantonly fall out of the mouths of the uneducated . 
  zomg you guise . 
  amazing . '', 
  some people want to argue . 
  since talking to my wife about the real prospect of relocating to france , i 've started thinking about this a lot more . 
  it 's compounded by the fact that my brother-in-law is from the us so there 's quite an interesting spectrum in our family from which to draw differences . 
  nah man it 's the moors ' right of return, 
   english is a mixed case : in germanic words , `` g '' is always hard , but in words from french , `` g '' has a soft form `` garage . '', 
  headshot , motherfuckers . 
  never forget . 
  a poignant mix of big friendly giant and bull shit . 
  i ca n't wait for ndt to get pissy and nationalistic about it like he did with ` cern should have been built in america ' and ` dates are arbitrary and fun is n't allowed ; europe should n't be first to land on europa , names are arbitrary . ', 
  logic , people !, 
  on the back of courses on ww2 and the cold war , gorbachev is presented as something of a hero in the history textbooks . 
  at least he was in the one i used . 
  homophobia is fairly rare these days . 
  it 's still there , do n't get me wrong , but there 's such a strong anti-homophobia culture that most of them shut up and dare not speak out . 
  the result is a pretty open society which is accepting . 
  `` look at all this oil !, 
  what shall we do with it ?? '', 
  cdg would like a word . 
  you and your jerry cans !, 
  you 're in cahoots with francis maude are n't you ? 
  do n't forget inbred . 
  that 's still quite a lot of oil . 
  that 's some lock-up .
