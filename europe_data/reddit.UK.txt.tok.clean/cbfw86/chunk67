  what treachery is this !, 
  you kidding me ? 
  i think we can trust the website of / r/jailbait and / r/spacedicks to shine a positive light on the european parliament . 
  given how many people they 've offended , i 'd say say they are actually quite good at satire . 
  mark godwin can fuck himself . 
  because tongue in cheek provocateurism works for the economist every week . 
  no it 's not . 
  the federalists have an opportunity to put their money where there mouth is and treat the prosperity of the greek economy as important as their treat their own - which ever country they come from . 
  instead they are watching athens burn and blaming the greeks for it , despite the fact that it was basically germany steering the ship the mast of which the greeks had tied themselves to . 
  i 'm honestly fed up of this rhetoric that greece are in this situation purely because of the greeks . 
  grow the fuck up . 
   right of return the problem with this is that eventually all the people who remember when israel was palestinian will be dead , and if you turf the israelis out the `` right of return '' will be about the israelis who were thrown out of their homes of 50 years . 
  the right of return claim will soon die . 
  lol, 
   napoleon did n't start wars , he finished them . 
  topkek, 
  you start conflict . 
  which we should have seen coming . 
  do you really think that mighty greece was able to hoodwink the collective prowess of all the eu 's intelligence and diplomatic services ? 
  do you think that that is a smart and discerning take on the events surrounding greece 's entry into the eu and the eurozone ? 
  that 's such a bullshit answer . 
  if you 're really going to peddle that forever then at least take a holistic view of history first . 
  greece has been so fucked by the eurozone it is hard to fully grasp . 
  by that logic debt would not exist . 
  `` we agreed 30 years ago that you 'd pay off your mortgage . '', 
  `` the past is in the past !, 
  let it go . '', 
  i love your flair, 
  he would n't . 
  the eu cares more about finland than it does about ukraine ( sorry ukraine ) . 
  europe would n't tolerate this . 
  and neither would america . 
  yes because kids coming home from school learning about fuck nuggets and hot carls is the same thing as atheism . 
  what have we become, 
  ** 1 ** : `` we need good gsce results so we look like a competent school . 
  what languages should we teach ? '', 
  ** 2 ** : `` french and spanish are pretty straight forward . 
  so 's german . '', 
  ** 3 ** : `` what about russian ? '', 
  ** 1 ** : `` hahahahaha !!, 
  hahaha !, 
  hahaha !, 
  ha ... you 're fired . '', 
  this guy is certifiably insane . 
  i 've been watching that recently on the train to work . 
  such an amazing movie . 
  the dream is collapsing, 
  i 'm honestly impressed we made it to 1.6 . 
  good work , guys !, 
  my wife 's french . 
  we met on my erasmus year . 
  the hardest part is the in-laws . 
  my in-laws judge me incessantly . 
  apparently i 'm pathologically obsessed with owning my own property ( which i am , except for the pathologically part ) , and i 'm ` entitled ' and ` spoilt ' because my dad actually made something of his career and now has so much money he does n't know whether to spend it on us now or just leave it to us when he dies ; despite the fact , of course , that my parents have n't spent any money on em outside of birthdays and christmas in about 4 year , and that was to lend - lend - me # 700 to reach the asking price for a new car . 
  they keep making comments that my son looks like their side and does n't look like me . 
  maybe it 's a ` winning genes ' thing , but it grates . 
  ` he has his grandfather 's thighs . ', 
  fuck you , i was a second row for seven years at secondary school ; i think it 's safe to say that my son has my thighs , to say nothing of the fact that he 's huge and my father in law is like 5 ' 6 '' . 
  ` if he ever does anything for his country he 'll be french . ', 
  shit like that . 
  if france beat england in the six nations it 's because they 're better , if england beat france it ` was our turn this year ' . 
  the jokes about england are thick and fast when we 're over there ; the queen , not being truly free , losing to the americans , being america 's bitch , being absent from the eu , not ` getting ' the eu , clinging to our pound like it matters , crap food and flat warm beer , poor cheeses ( i shit you not that joke was actually made ; i could n't laugh because i knew i could style it out to a believable level of laughing * with * the joke ) . 
  but given the french inability to take a joke , i know - from personal experience - that if i fire back i 'm stonewalled until my wife lectures me and makes me apologise . 
  `` all your kings used to be educated in france before they went over to england . 
  what does that say about your culture ? '', 
  `` that 's because we owned half of france . 
  we also killed joan of arc . 
  * chin chin * . '', 
  '' ... '' which is bs . 
  my wife and i have pretty much the same globalised culture typical of people who grew up in a connecting world : same music , same movies , similar tv . 
  but the cultural divide between me and my wife 's parents is quite significant . 
  aside from what 's mentioned above , the assumption that i 'm breaking some immutable law of the universe by wanting to take my family on our own holiday and not join the tribe in a big villa in the south of france every year , and the blasphemy i commit when i actually break said immutable law , makes marrying from another culture somewhat tricky . 
  u-s-e !, 
  u-s-e !, 
  u-s-e !, 
  u-s-e !, 
  it would be a double standard but because it 's france we just call this behaviour french . 
  we used to welcome them to london off the eurostar at waterloo station . 
  it was fun while it lasted . 
  next they 'll be shocked to learn that developed countries have contingency plans for alien contact . 
  is this thread remembering the people who died ( who are n't mentioned in the title ) , or is it remembering an islamist attack ? 
  because the different focus is not the same thing . 
  there was a city am headline the other day which rade , `` germany : we wo n't fall for trojan horse '' . 
  the missing word at the end was `` again '' . 
  personally i think the greeks did cook the books but we either knew and let them in , else we were asleep at the gates . 
  in essence , i think it takes two to tango . 
  stamping on their face does n't help them , and it does n't help the eu either . 
  do you really expect me to believe the `` we need to federalise '' circlejerk - both on reddit and irl - when we do n't act the way a federalised super state does ? 
  chicken and egg arguments aside , if the federalists want to change the status quo they need evidence for it that it 's viable and worthwhile . 
  snubbing greece and ruining them as a nation is the antithesis of what you 're supposed to do to create evidence to change the status quo . 
  but to answer op directly , i hope greece pulls off what it 's trying to do . 
  the only way greece wo n't leave the eu and eurozone is for the larger economies to swallow the bomb . 
  passing it back to greece will only ruin them for generations . 
  and not only is that not right , but it will also highlight the fact that the euro has failed ; it did not create mutual prosperity and success for those who adopted it - it made rich countries richer while making poor countries poorer . 
   hourglass societies good phrase, 
  it takes two to lie ; one to lie and one to listen . 
  we let them in . 
  saying ` they cooked the books ' is a waste of time . 
  you really think the diplomatic services of the eu did n't know ? 
  if only there was a way to have all the stuff all the time .
