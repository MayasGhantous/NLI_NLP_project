  on the contrary , it is the young who have to clean up the mess . 
  they have to deal with the fact that work just got more complicated . 
  they have to deal with the fact that the cost efficient supplier procurement is telling them to use is riddled with risk because they 're chinese and the contracting is a ball ache thanks to cultural and underlying philosophical differences which have developed over centuries . 
  they have to worry about the nhs collapsing because they will be the economically active generation who will be told to pay for private healthcare , as well as pay for the cover for the old . 
  the young have just been handed a bunch of blueprints they did n't want and are being told to deal with it , and all because old people do n't like the idea of working to integrate with other countries to build a very long term future they just wo n't be around to experience . 
  what stake does a 70 year pensioner have in some new trade deal with india ? 
  why do they give a fuck ? 
  it 's not just the politicians who are guilty of lighting the fire and buggering off . 
  they claim to care about the future and are yet the least likely to recycle and most likely to believe climate change is a corporate hoax . 
  you could n't make it up . 
  the baby boomers will be derided by historians for generations to come as selfish . 
  they facilitated the atomisation of western societies and in the case of britain they then , as a final parting shot , obliterated their kids ' chances of building the future that they were looking forward too . 
  `` i want my country back , '' will be ridiculed for a century . 
  when they 're dead and buried we 'll all be ( very literally thanks to an utterly absurd amount of inheritance ) better off . 
  but . 
  the apocalypse . 
  i was so optimistic . 
  shut up and get in the back of the van while we drive you off into a future you did n't want before we die at the wheel !, 
  and mow my lawn , you little shit !, 
  i carried you for 9 months !, 
  no that was 15 years ago . 
  the system is broken , and that system has benefited the 1 % and the elderly who enjoyed the absurd wealth creation of the 70s , 80s and 90s when they were younger . 
  it 's hard to begrudge them for just living through the time period , but it 's pretty easy to begrudge the greedy ones who lasso millenials in a buy to let mortgage to turn them into their 8th source of retired income . 
  just , yaknow , for shits and giggles lol . 
  at 30 years old i have come the conclusion that i 'm just going to be ' a poor person ' . 
  i really should n't upvote that . 
  it 's still a dick move to shove your kids into the back of a car and drive them off into a future they did n't want . 
  #escalation !, 
  clearly joanna never saw the chart . 
  is ireland as humid as the uk ? 
  i would guess yes but you never know . 
  number of customers . 
  that explains why the uk was the frequent target of ira attacks . 
  more irish = more terrorists . 
  it 's so obvious . 
  i see that stormfront have been tipped off . 
  guess where all the refugees are ? 
  guess where they 're going to try and leave immediately ? 
  guess which army is currently too distracted to think about ending the conflict in syria so the source of the refugee crisis ends ? 
  enjoy the bloodlust . 
  this has just set us back from solving the migrant crisis by a few years . 
  social darwinism now !, 
  people are voting le pen because they 're racist and france is generally far more xenophobic that it 's citizens would like to admit . 
  there is a price to be paid when you hold you own culture in such high esteem over the whole world . 
  my biggest regret over brexit is that it 's caused europeans to double down on the eu . 
  i wanted remain , but the eu is a shitty institution that needs a lot of work . 
  defending it all costs is bad for all of us . 
  it needs drastic change . 
  it can start by listening to people . 
  you are going to have a great time getting to know boris johnson . 
  his show is just an act . 
  i 'm not happy about a lot that fits gone on over the past few months , and this is one of them , but when i distance myself from my emotions i 'm not in the slightest bit worried about boris johnson being fs . 
  germany made you sell some of the letters . 
  spain ca n't do anything about scotland leaving the uk . 
  after that , spain 's in no position to start vetoing an independent nation , especially when they 've got the oil and germany and france lean on spain . 
  further still , if they treated scotland like dirt it would only galvanise the catalonians . 
  i doubt that , personally . 
  are things really still that bad ? 
  i 'd have thought that people would have found a solution . 
  federalise maybe ? 
  i 'll quote you on that one day . 
  the british parliamentary system is a botch because the roundheads pussied out at the last minute . 
  it 's been fudged over again and again and again ever since . 
  how likely is it that the uk will federalise ? 
  how would such an arrangement work in practice ? 
  what an appallingly narrow minded thing to say . 
  grow up , you sad little internet troll . 
  yes . 
  what 's your point ? 
   europeans see the eu as a collective construct to bring people closer together . 
  young europeans . 
  most european people i know simply do n't give a shit about bringing people together , and it 's about amplified global reach . 
  you underestimate boris johnson . 
  how are those deficit fines working out ? 
  the one 's forced upon you by bigger countries which do n't pay their fines ? 
  we can all talk about reality , but you seem to be living outside of it . 
  do you consider the eu-free lancaster house treaties to be insignificant ? 
  i was for remain , but the european union is hardly that . 
  the european union used to be that back when people had a veto , because it meant that the union moved as one after , and only after , the agreed path had been identified . 
  when it became about majority voting you ended up with entire countries being overridden by the politics of other countries . 
  that 's about as united as an abusive marriage . 
  he knew . 
  the eastern and southern nations are already absolutely screwed , precisely because people are just upping sticks and leaving . 
  what 's moral wickedness got to do with this ? 
  that 's not how nationalism works . 
  get with the unfolding 21st century , m8 .

  why should the costs of single market access be so arduous ? 
  not looking to start a fight . 
  just interested in your opinion . 
  why not have tariff free access and 90 day visa waivers for tourism and business trips and just leave it at that ? 
  do we know anyone who can bug the room ? 
  how far does / r/europe 's network reach ? 
  the only way it could happen is for the eu to give a deal so bad that it would force the uk to bottle it . 
  it is possible that this is why theresa may has appointed her brexit minsters first and made sure they were all leavers . 
  foreign office , international trade minister and brexit minister are all brexiteers . 
  if they ca n't pull it off , the theory goes , no one can . 
  so politically they all die a death for having lied to the country , and then we have the conversation again and discuss whether we can actually do this thing and make a sensible go of it . 
  with sterling hit as hard as it has been the government wo n't raise tariffs . 
  the country would flip its shit .
