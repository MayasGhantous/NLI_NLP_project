  well this is deceptive , since it 's titled ` what brexiters want ' and is actually ` percentage support for a list of policies selected by a left wing clickbait website ' . 
  also , why would n't i attack the poll , it 's a deliberate smear attempt . 
  you act like my pointing this out is somehow a bad thing . 
  it 's almost like it 's done mostly by qmv since the time limit on the ability to request a vote under pre-lisbon rules has expired . 
  shit , why do i know more about the thing we 're leaving than the people in it ? 
  also , it 's a fucking joke . 
  calm down . 
  it captures just over 50 % support among a group with a noted bias towards the elderly for some policies with the broad theme of ` make stuff like it used to be ' . 
  hardly a groundbreaking concept that older people think that things were better in the past . 
  i think sketch comedians worked that one out in the 60s, 
  i mean , that seems more like the presence of a problem with your parliamentary elections than the absence of a problem with the eu ones . 
  people feeling like their vote ca n't change anything is deeply unhealthy in a democracy, 
  [ this is the uk equivalent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjko6pzr54g ), 
  to be fair , it specifies the rebellious ones . 
  the rest are fine . 
  also , that was never an official verse , and there 's no record of its existence before 1822 , when it was mentioned as an occasional addition . 
  there 's a jacobite verse as well , by the way : god bless the prince , i pray , god bless the prince , i pray , charlie i mean ; that scotland we may see freed from vile presbyt ` ry , both george and his feckie , ever so , amen . 
  loads of people added ` fan verses ' as i 'd call them : ** some highlights include the ` sod the french ' verse : ** from france and pretender great britain defend her , foes let them fall ; from foreign slavery , priests and their knavery , and popish reverie , god save us all . 
  ** and the rather lovely official peace version : ** [ normal 1st verse ] one realm of races four blest more and ever more god save our land !, 
  home of the brave and free set in the silver sea true nurse of chivalry god save our land !, 
  of many a race and birth from utmost ends of earth god save us all !, 
  bid strife and hatred cease bid hope and joy increase spread universal peace god save us all !, 
  [ the decision making process of the eu , made ridiculously simple ] ( http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gettyimages-605679830-714x484.jpg ), 
  call me when you reach 50 % turnout on an eu election . 
  the picture it paints is a deliberately skewed one . 
  it takes a selection of fringe issues and trivialities and attempts to paint them as ` what brexiters want ' . 
  these are no more the reasons for the leave vote than amsterdam weed was the reason for the remain voters ' choices . 
  it 's a shitty methodology , because it is entirely informed by the prexisiting biases of the people who commissioned the survey . 
  if i go around asking homeless people if they want a list of different drugs , have i found out what they actually want , or have i merely found out which drugs are popular ? 
  likewise , this survey does n't find out what leave voters want , it finds out which stereotypical nostaliga policies are the most popular . 
  ok , here 's an example of how you can be unfair with a survey like this . 
  i want to smear the remain side . 
  so i put out a survey saying : do you think the following are benefits of the eu : you can drive to other countries for booze you can go to amsterdam for marijuana people who want to visit prostitutes can go to countries where it is legal to do so ( y/n ) then i normailse my axes to whatever gets the highest percentage of yes responses and publish ` what remainers want : booze , drugs and prostitutes ' obviously , all of these are pretty incidental and are n't major parts of the decision process for the average remain voter , but by controlling what questions were asked , i can build a skewed narrative and trivialise their decision . 
  the trick is to ask the right questions . 
  if you 're a clickbait site , then obviously there 's no point in asking about things like immigration control , because there 's no catharsis for your readers in hearing that , like the vast majority of people in the uk , leavers want more controls on immigration . 
  you have to find things that make them look silly , and then adjust your axes until it looks like they support them, 
  this is what media controlling a narrative looks like . 
  if you set the questions and set your axis so that 53 % looks like 100 % , you can make any group look bad . 
  look at who set the questions . 
  the survey was commissioned and designed by the independent.co.uk , a pro-eu clickbait site . 
  it 's designed to paint leavers in a bad light . 
  this was n't a free choice ` what do you want from brexit ' it was ` how many people can we get to agree to these shit policies so we can make fun of leavers ', 
  my point is that once we do n't have it , it wo n't be . 
  that 's the point at which i propose ceasing to pay . 
  or , and here 's an idea ... we do n't pay for shit we 're getting no benefit from . 
  we say ` the uk has paid in over # 200 billion net to this project , and that 's plenty . 
  we agree to waive our claim to a proportionate share of eu assets . 
  i predict it wo n't , especially if the sort of smug , dismissive cunt that currently infests the joke of a parliament , and of which verhofstadt is a particularly odious example , continues to be the face the eu shows to the world . 
  perhaps you 're being downvoted because the british are brigading , perhaps a rogue party of grammar professors came through and downvoted due the spasms that your mess of a comment provoked or perhaps you 're talking a tremendous load of shite . 
  we 'll really never know . 
  now that last bit is unfair . 
  she does loads of work , jetting all over europe to hold important conferences with whatever junior minister various governments can spare to explain for the 50th fucking time that scotland has to join the eu like a normal country if it becomes independent . 
  people love to watch a farce . 
  unfortunately , they 're rapidly turning it into a tragedy . 
  i have an image of someone in a vault full of coins , cackling madly . 
  yes , yes , all for norway !, 
  muhahaha !, 
  seriously , that 's a big chunk . 
  it 's not that anyone thinks you 'll actually need it , but in theory , if there was one , the eu would expect the uk to pay in , and now it wants us to pay the money just in case there ever is . 
  well , for a start , a large portion is n't ` signed commitments ' , it 's stuff the eu may or may not figure out how to spend at some point . 
  then there 's the contingent liabilites . 
  to give a metaphor for the situation , if you crash your car , your insurers have agreed to pay out for repairs up to a certain sum . 
  what the eu wants is for the uk to pay the full amount , just in case the eu has a crash later . 
  ( in this metaphor , the crash is defaults on eib loans or ireland needing a bailout ), 
  as the wikipedia article notes , the junction ` has an excellent safety record , since traffic moves too slowly to do serious damage in the event of a collision ', 
  do you mean fell ? 
  swindon . 
  it 's called the magic roundabout . 
  simple . 
  you drive on the left and go around roundabouts clockwise , but the overall centre roundabout goes anticlockwise . 
  the requirement is 2 % of gdp spent on the military . 
  it does n't mention specific suppliers or force composition . 
  [ the uk , for example , sources its material from a wide variety of places ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_equipment_of_the_british_army ), 
  yeah , we should get them a red top . 
  the nato efp in eastern europe has 4 battlegroups , 1 each lead by uk , usa , canadian and german forces . 
  they do n't really need to move , they 're already over there . 
  yes , the usa is complaining that eu nations do n't pay their share . 
  that 's because it 's broadly true . 
  the solution is not to write off us forces as an ally , it 's to pay your share . 
  nato are doing what is required of them . 
  the eu , meanwhile , is sitting and complaining that everyone is being mean . 
  [ why not 5 roundabouts coming together to form a megaroundabout ? 
  ] ( https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/63119000/jpg/_63119443_msn_magic_roundabout_470x350.jpg ), 
  the uk did n't join it though . 
  to be fair , that headline , along with ` gotcha ' and ` the truth ' are pretty famous in the uk ( ` gotcha ' being the response to the sinking of the belgrano , and ` the truth ' being in reference to an entirely false account the sun printed attempting to demonise the victims of the hillsborough disaster ), 
  so do we . 
  gossip rags have red tops , actual newspapers do n't ( the proper papers also used to also be impractically huge , but some are now printed in a format that makes them vaguely usable , which is a shame . 
  the ft remains , happily , both massive and , as it has been since the late 19th century , pink ), 
  yes , spain does have the right to close their border . 
  they exercised it under franco , and perhaps that 's what their government seeks to emulate . 
  that 's up to them . 
  but the uk wo n't allow the people of gibraltar to be put under the thumb of a government they do n't want . 
  what the spanish minister said is that he 'd plant his flag on gibraltar . 
  that 's like me saying ` we 're going to seek a reasonable compromise , after our tanks roll into madrid ' . 
  i imagine you 'd focus on the madrid bit , rather than the reasonable compromise . 
  basically , blockade them and try to force them to capitulate through economic warfare . 
  seems to be the threat . 
  [ i do n't know if franco ever had his ministers talk about planting his flag on gibraltar though ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/06/spains-foreign-minister-vows-to-plant-his-flag-on-gibraltar/ ) . 
  that might have been a bit too much like warmongering , even for a facist . 
  franco was a moron , sure , but how was his plan different from what your government is threatening now ?
