  the snp pledged to only vote on scottish and uk-wide issues . 
  they failed to mention that ` pissing off the english ' is a scottish issue . 
  well , in this case , it appears to be taking lessons from the british one anyway . 
  yeah , that 's a fair point , i have n't put up the previous results in this thread yet so it 's not fair to make that claim without substantiaiting it . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum#post.e2.80.93referendum_polling ) nb : today 's result is n't in there yet . 
  yep . 
  i just figured it was worth putting this up since the return to the norm after an outlier tends to get less press coverage than the outlier does .

  well , last time they tried to lift the ban , the snp prevented it ( despite the ban only applying in england and wales , the snp decided it was a scottish issue ), 
  i think we can blame the independent for being massively sensationalist over a supermarket advocating locally produced food . 
  not at all . 
  how would that be enforcable ? 
  i ca n't see a law that forces supermarkets to buy meat from farms they do n't want to buy from getting through . 
  great job reading the article . 
  you clearly took into account that this was a supermarket calling for other supermarkets to follow its policy of prioritising uk beef rather than just responding to a sensationalist headline . 
  good thing too , or you 'd have looked like a right twat . 
  to be clear , while there is a co-operative party , they are n't affiiated with the co-op supermarket , and are n't in government . 
  ca n't fault the guy at his age . 
  it 's not the most strenuous job in the world , but he 'll be 96 by the time he retires , and the amount of travel and activity in his job has got to be exhausting at that age . 
  do you think that the eu would survive letting deutsche crash to benefit greece ? 
  there were a fair few french banks exposed heavily too . 
  i ca n't see the major contributor nations putting up with that . 
  you assume the commission would n't throw every single person in europe under a bus if it meant preserving the project . 
  they made it clear with greece that they 'd rather push the eu project than do what 's best for the people of the eu . 
  * looks at london debt agreement with growing sense of regret *, 
  well , you seem woefully deluded . 
  there are lots of people in the eu whose livelihoods depend on trade with the uk , and vice versa , this is n't a situation where no deal is a good thing for anyone . 
  the best interests of the people of the eu are served by a trade deal . 
  the best interests of the eu project are served by making brexit as damaging as possible to scare other member states into line . 
  it is becoming increasingly obvious that , as with the people of greece before them , the people whose jobs depend on uk trade will be sacrificed to keep the protection racket going . 
  to be clear , the uk is n't asking for all the benefits of membership . 
  we 're asking for an fta , the same as mexico , canada and several other non-eu states have . 
  it 's a pretty simple check for whose interests are being served . 
  if the eu is about doing the best for the people of the eu , they 'll make a deal . 
  if it 's about pushing the project at any cost , they wo n't . 
  you ca n't really hack voting in the uk . 
  we use pencil and paper and count in the presence of the candidates . 
  postal votes can be faked , but that 's not a big issue outside tower hamlets . 
  it suggests she 's likely to put what the people want ahead of her personal preferences . 
  a true believer might well end up pushing for their vision regardless of cost . 
  may will get the best she can with little prejudice . 
  there 's a difference between irish nationalism and respecting democracy . 
  not just ' a job ' , but a job that pays enough to make it worth keeping them . 
  we can get low skilled workers from any 3rd world country , no need to continue favouring those in the eu if the eu is n't prepared to do a deal . 
  evert strawberry picker from eastern europe could be replaced with an indian , and we 'd get some leverage in a deal there . 
  with the eu , sure . 
  but it 's increasingly clear that the eu has no interest in a deal and is taking its usual approach of prioritizing the project over the people , so there 's no real reason to pay money for a deal that we do n't expect to ever happen . 
  i 'd imagine the eu states would figure out which uk citizens they were n't making a profit on and send them back here . 
  given that there 's about 3 eu citizens in the uk for every brit in the eu , we 'd end up significantly better off . 
  i think you 're confusing ` eugenics ' and ` the immigration policy of every developed country on the planet ' . 
  easy mistake to make . 
  well , hooray for the godwin 's law , that did n't take long . 
  i listed the groups that are least profitable to keep , which is how we should prioritise . 
  either we 're keeping people because we need them or because we 've got an agreement with their home countries . 
  if they do n't fit either category , then there 's no good reason for us to pay for them to stay . 
  yeah , this is rather like giving # 2 a week to greenpeace , cancelling your subscription and then receiving a demand for # 2k because they 'd counted on you paying for the next 50 years . 
  it 's pretty easy . 
  what you do is blame the eu for being unreasonable . 
  true or not , it solves the problem . 
  not like farmers are a significant voting bloc anyway , and rural areas were strongly pro-brexit , so blaming the eu will probably sell fine there . 
  there 's a bit of a fallacious argument in there , in that it basically suggests that change is impossible , and that anything that means you ca n't do it how you currently do it means you ca n't do it at all . 
  the point about bailey 's for example . 
  there 's no reason the milk has to be bounced back and forth , but at the moment there 's no reason not to , so it is . 
  that does n't mean that without a deal the whole thing would stop , just that it 'd have to work differently . 
  also , i 'm not terribly fussed about uk agricultural exports , they are essentially a wildly inefficient way of paying unemployment benefits to a bunch of farmers . 
  if they go bust , we 'll save a fortune on subsidies . 
  to be fair , we also had massive war debts , and unlike some countries that started the war , we did n't get ours written off . 
  it means no deal and a bill of 0 . 
  the eu seem to be pushing for no deal . 
  that 's the only reasonable interpretation of this move . 
  the threat of them not doing a deal that they probably wo n't do even if we do pay . 
  so not much at all now . 
  i have no confidence that paying this bill would lead to any meaningful deal . 
  the eu has clearly demonstrated that they ca n't be trusted to stick to their word already . 
  offer citizenship if they renounce their original citizenship . 
  not true at all . 
  we do n't have to treat the 3.5 m as a single bloc . 
  some of them will be unemployed . 
  they can go . 
  some will be elderly or disabled . 
  they can go . 
  some will be employed in low skilled jobs . 
  they can stay until they can be replaced . 
  no deal does n't mean ` kick them all out ' it means ` kick out who we please ' . 
  coincidentally , 100bn is about 2 years worth of corporation tax income . 
  i say we do n't pay , and use the money to halve corporation tax for 4 years . 
  well , looks like it 's hard brexit . 
  might as well knock 10 % of corporation tax in the next budget too . 
  we prefer the term ` wuss rugby ', 
  to quote a great author , ` it can hardly be a coincidence that no language on earth has ever produced the expression `` as pretty as an airport . '', 
  airports are ugly . 
  some are very ugly . 
  some attain a degree of ugliness that can only be the result of a special effort . ', 
  gatwick is the last one . 
  they 're just mad because we invented all the global sports . 
  well , us and the scottish . 
  i believe you have the import numbers . 
  exports are closer to 44 %, 
  they announced plans on how to integrate ni into the irish eu membership recently .
