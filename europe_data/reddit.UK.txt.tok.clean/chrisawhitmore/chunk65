  i think that 's a bit provocative . 
  imagine if they 'd published a plan on how they 'd deal with , for example , getting rid of estonia 's meps if russia were to annex them , or set up a roadmap for catalonian accession to the eu, 
  i 'm afraid ` but i was sure i was going to win ' is n't accepted as an excuse . 
  well , to be fair , it 's not like they had a chance once eddie izzard and bob geldoff started supporting them . 
  that 's part of the metaphor . 
  like the cl , the eu pretends to be for everyone but it 's mostly just corporate seats . 
  the police in question have been suspended pending a marksmanship course . 
  ok , so the champions league involves lots of teams from all over europe , but the refereeing is shit and they tend to let the spanish get away with anything they like . 
  while it is ostensibly for the fans , most of the seats go to corporate sponsors and the whole thing is about funnelling money into the hands of a select few . 
  league one , however , is much more english focused , smaller , and tends to be a lot less about people inflating their own egos while lining their pockets and a lot more about people doing the thing they are there to do . 
  well he 's saying that the people enforcing the rules in the eu ( like the referees in the champions league ) are fucking useless and tend to let a lot of cheating pass them by . 
  in 2016 , they said that growth in 2017 would slow significantly . 
  now it 's 2018 . 
  odds are next year it 'll be due to slow in 2019, 
  i agree . 
  [ and you definitely ca n't have an eu that gives countries like france special dispensation on budgetary rules for no good reason ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-deficit-france-idukkcn0ym1n0 ) i suggest the eu deals with the violations in the order they were committed . 
  everyone is equal , but [ france is ... france ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-deficit-france-idukkcn0ym1n0 ), 
  yeah , that 's 290 billion euro . 
  not an inconsiderable sum . 
  oh , that was what the independent claimed an unnamed source had seen on an unnamed civil servants ' papers on a train , was n't it . 
  well , i guess there 's no point denying it . 
  irrefutable really . 
  at any rate , leaving the echr is something that should be taken seriously and done when there is time to give it proper consideration and with a cross party discussion . 
  it 'd be irresponsible to do it when there was no meaningful opposition and the civil service was busy with a monumental task like brexit . 
  yeah , they 're losing easy access to 8 of the top 10 unis in europe . 
  of course , unless the uk stays in erasmus , so are the rest of the members . 
  yeah , but that 's not how it 'd work . 
  losing the automatic right to stay does n't mean everyone gets expelled , it means anyone could be , for whatever reason we feel like . 
  i thought that was something you guys made up to wind up the estonians ? 
  the french were duly fined for that . 
  it just happens that the eu voted for the fine to be 0, 
  no , the amusing part is that the articles seem contradictory , since it 's rare that members of a wholly united organisation call for sanctions against one another . 
  probably a good idea to start building up the funds they 'd need to pay for ni now . 
  i believe it 's called the soverign republic of ` dublin can we have some more money please ! ', 
  there 's something amusing about an article discussing how united the eu is being right next to an article about the man almost certain to become president of france calling for sanctions against poland on the subreddit . 
  i suggest we veto it for shits and giggles . 
  not sure you understand the difference between poor governance and coastal raiding . 
  1 ) true , but measuring wealth is a tricky business , especially at the top end , since the wealth of the wealthiest is not necessarily arranged in such a way as to make it easy for governments to assess . 
  likewise , does debt count negatively ? 
  if so , is a student with debt they only have to pay off under certain conditions as poor as someone who has taken a payday loan for the same amount ? 
  2 ) from the [ methodology section ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catid=1050&amp;intpageid=1874&amp;langid=en ) , it says ` income is defined as annual household disposable income , including social transfers and excluding taxes on income and social contributions ' so we can assume it 's not just job earned income . 
  oh right . 
  i was confused as to why ` the country ' being against brexit would make any difference to having their local affairs run from one place or another while westminster decided brexit terms in either case . 
  [ are we ? 
  it seems like we 're only just in the top half of eu countries on share of income going to the richest ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/social_monitor/images/ineq_1.png ) [ likewise , we 're about halfway on the share of the income for the poorest ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/social_monitor/images/ineq_2.png ) [ gini coefficient puts us in 11th ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/social_monitor/images/ineq_3.png ) [ 80/20 puts us in 13th ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/social_monitor/images/ineq_5.png ) you seem to be talking out of your arse ( [ figures from the eu commission website ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catid=1050&amp;intpageid=1870&amp;langid=en ) ), 
  so again , if the uk had decided it owned part of canada , would the eu have prepared for the case that the people there decided to agree ? 
  and we 'll offset that against the cost of all the raiding the irish did on anglo-saxon settlements over the years . 
  yeah , we 'll take it off of the ` you are n't run by nazis ' bill . 
  ni has not decided to join ireland . 
  so the eu is preparing to take the territory before the people of that territory or the state that territory belongs to have elected to do join it . 
   nobody in northern ireland wants this ` nobody ' here meaning 44 % of ni voters , who voted for brexit . 
  either we pretend the majority result is unanimous , in which case everyone in ni wanted brexit , since everyone in the uk did , or we represent the result accurately . 
  your choice . 
  two actually . 
  they already owed ireland for sitting out ww2 . 
  so if , while in the eu , we 'd decided that we owned , say , canada , would the eu have backed our claim and made ready for our annexation of it ? 
  ` modern day slavery ' here meaning ' a flexible working arrangement the vast majority of people involved in prefer to a fixed term contract ' mcdonalds ran a pilot scheme recently in which offered a bunch of staff in st. helens on zhcs permanent contracts . 
  less than 20 % accepted . 
  except if we go back one more , we get +1 % . 
  so it 's a 3 % swing over a month and a bit . 
  a further week back and the swing is 2 % . 
  you 're measuring from a local high to a local low . 
  ok , you 've picked a 5 poll range out which goes : right lead : +4 , +2 , +3 , +0 , -2 whereas i could pick out the period from just before may 's conference speech and get : +2 , +1 , +1 , +3 , -1 it 's worth noting as well that all the non-yougov polls in there show much bigger leads for ` right ' . 
  it 's risky to try inferring trends from movements within margin of error . 
  this is one poll out of many . 
  this is the second such poll to produce that result . 
  the first was in november last year . 
  it 's worth noting that the same poll also produced a swing to labour and an upswing in approval for corbyn in the national figures , neither of which are being mirrored by other pollsters . 
  looks like a sampling issue . 
  [ be wary of cherry picking . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum#post.e2.80.93referendum_polling ), 
  random variation in polling . 
  ask the question enough times , eventually an outlier will hit the right bit . 
  which amounted to a reduction in our net contribution from ludicrous to merely massive , and only incidental exposure to stupid ideas we 'd pointed out the stupidity of in the first place, 
  spurs say chelsea ` at risk ' in upcoming matches . 
  who signs a 30 year lease in london ? 
  that 's an apocalyptic waste of money , especially when there 's no reason to need canary wharf offices for a regulatory agency . 
  stick it near some labs . 
  huh . 
  i 'd love to see a translation of those photos if anyone who sees in french can make one . 
  the exceptions in general amount to a reduction in the net amount of money we give the eu and the ability to not take part in ideas we never asked for or wanted to be part of ( given in exchange for our not vetoing those ideas ) . 
  ` you do n't have to jump off this cliff with us , how lucky !, 
  oh , and here 's some of your own money back . 
  are n't we generous ! ', 
  they actually might this time . 
  the tories have hit 50 % in at least one poll so far , and as this story proves , one poll is plenty if it fits your narrative . 
  which means this is a poll suggesting that a new vote might go 51-49 in favour of remain . 
  yougov published a similar result on 22nd june last year . 
   more and more people one poll has shown a within margin of error movement in that direction . 
  bear in mind that yougov had remain winning the day before the referendum . 
  [ also , here 's a list of post referendum polls . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum#post.e2.80.93referendum_polling ) only 1 of the 22 conducted up to the end of last month showed a remain lead , with 2 showing draws . 
  thinking the decision was a mistake and thinking that a second referendum will improve matters are 2 very different positions . 
  voting for the lib dems at best gets a ld/labour coalition . 
  that would not be something that appeals to most people . 
  this poll would allow for 50/50 easily within margin of error . 
  [ post referendum polling does n't make this result seem like the norm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum#post.e2.80.93referendum_polling ), 
  they have strong evidence that it was carried out by government forces . 
  the sarin is pretty definitively of syrian government manufacture , and there 's no other force in the area capable of deploying it, 
  ok , so to summarise the actual evidence : the key is that the sarin samples from the attack contain sarin , hexamine and dimp ( a side product of sarin production from isopropyl alcohol ) and crucially hexamine ( used to lower the ph and thus stabilise the final product and prolong shelf life ) the stabilising agent is a good way to tell who made a batch of sarin .
