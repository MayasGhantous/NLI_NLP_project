  i like it . 
  leaves the cu with all the debts and england with all the profitable bits . 
  is no potato , only sadness . 
  ( now i 'm repurposing latvia jokes . 
  who said european integration is impossible ? ), 
  i flatly refuse to use / s on my sarcasm . 
  i 'm british . 
  sarcasm is implied . 
  makes sense , we sold it to them . 
  ( it 's the ferdinand pictured , by the way , not the daring , which looks like [ this ] ( http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/-/media/royal-navy-responsive/images/units-and-equipment/ships-and-surface-fleet/destroyers/type-45/hms-daring/carousel/120119-daring-06.jpg?mh=447&amp;mw=980&amp;thn=0&amp;hash=393e8c9d6124f39fb7e9a301c45f4df4ca4895f1 ) ) the ferdinand used to be the coventry , named for the type 42 hms coventry sunk by argentinian bombers in the falklands war . 
  why would they be ? 
  it 's about the least interesting election in the last 20 years . 
  will the majority be 90 or 100 ? 
  who knows . 
  or cares . 
  why not include the english parliamen ... ah , bugger . 
  ruth davidson basically is the scottish tory party, 
  - biggest intelligence service and only 5 eyes member, 
  he says , conveniently far from russia in a position that the uk would defend anyway , as they did in ww2, 
  we know your language is just made up noises designed to sell milk . 
  we know your language is just made up noises designed to sell milk . 
  i think we can all agree that a united ireland is a good idea . 
  the sooner as the south comes to its senses and rejoins the uk , the better . 
  ah , perfidious albion , doing exactly what it said it would do in a treaty and defending our allies from aggression . 
  basically , anyone who lost wars to us . 
  so about 90 % of the planet . 
  boy that 'd be a mess . 
  a passenger flight from argentina ( let 's assume an airbus a380 , since it 's the biggest capacity ) with about 600 troops on board , no air support , no armour , no hope of extraction or reinforcement within at least a day vs. 1000 + troops with air support already armed and in the air and naval fire support if needed . 
  my guess is it 'd last all of 2 minutes before a missile hit the landed plane and the commandos surrendered . 
  airstrips are n't the best places to find cover . 
  not really . 
  they 're in favour of land being occupied by nearby states against the will of the people living there based on a vague sense of entitlement . 
  follows that they 'd back the argentinians, 
  yeah , we made the mistake of not introducing transitional migration controls during the 2004 enlargement , which meant a lot of people in poor countries who could suddenly move to the uk but could n't really go anywhere else . 
  so we got rapid immigration , which meant ghettoization and a resulting failure to integrate , same as happens any time a big group of people are suddenly allowed to move into a country . 
  ` integrated ' . 
  clearly you 've never been to boston . 
  low skilled migrants do n't integrate , and eastern european culture is n't really that much more similar to british culture than any of the other options . 
  india is a perfectly good prospect for unskilled labour . 
  ingenious move from official borrowing to unofficial borrowing in the form of paying on a delay . 
  worked well for the pfi scheme in the uk , i 'm sure it 'll be just as successful in greece . 
  [ raf laughing ] ( http://i.makeagif.com/media/12-28-2014/ys7ev1.gif ), 
  they do n't have the right to decide argentina or the uk 's actions . 
  they have the right to decide their own position , and the uk has the right to decide to back that position . 
  given that he 's contesting the leadership of a major party against a guy who wants to leave the euro and the eu , he 's not exactly a fringe eurosceptic here, 
  as far as i 'm aware , there are a few billion unskilled labourers in the world . 
  i 'm sure there are countries outside the eu whose people would be just as keen to escape their home countries as the people of eastern europe are . 
  i like the eec question : in your opinion is the eec : a ) brilliant and indivisible b ) indivisible and brilliant c ) the most brilliant thing ever ( also indivisible ) d ) just the most brilliant and indivisible thing there has ever been, 
  since his money is in chf , yes , he should . 
  king of italy , actually . 
  yeah , comparing the falklands to catalonia is absurd . 
  the falklands are allowed to have a referendum if they want it . 
  nukes are more expensive and piss more people off than conventional forces . 
  the lead time , if their ships made good speed towards the falklands and landed unopposed , would be 6-10 hours from landing to the arrival of any reinforcements from the uk reaching the falklands ( probably a bit less if they pushed for speed rather than comfort , i 'm basing those times on the regular passenger flights from the uk to the falklands ), 
  argentina basically ca n't invade . 
  good summary [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fg5amio4ju ), 
  he 's also a major driving force behind brexit . 
  he pushed the eastern expanison , refused to implement transition migration controls and denied us a lisbon referendum ( on the technicality that he 'd only promised a referendum on the constitution , and the name had changed , as if manifestos were meant to be some kind of monkey 's paw style ` be careful what you wish for ' traps rather than honest statements of intention ) . 
  he also substantially reduced the uk rebate , leading to the massive net contributions which helped make the whole thing feel like a waste of money . 
  his failure to even secure concrete terms for the deal in which he gave up the rebate ( he was promised ` reform ' , as the eu has been promising pretty much since it came into existence ) meant that the british people were always going to feel short changed on the deal . 
  [ relevant source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xlytae3fpe ), 
  well , i 'm sure the argentinian president will come and present those demands as soon as he can find a plane ticket to the uk ( since the argentinian government is so broke that they ca n't take a presidential plane off their own soil without it getting repossessed ), 
  you see , the problem is that you 've got to be careful what you mean by ` best for the eu ' . 
  do you mean the people of the eu ? 
  because that means an fta and as much co-operation as possible . 
  or do you mean the eu as a politicial project ? 
  because then we 're into the ` no deal ' options . 
  as we 've seen in greece , the eu leaders value the project far more than they value the people who live in the eu , so i imagine we 'll get the latter . 
  well , at the moment it 's a lot more like driving along a road while a bunch of people scream ` tree !, 
  tree ! . 
  oh no wait , never mind , there 's no tree there . 
  tree !, 
  tree ! ', 
  indeed , there is not court in the world to take this case to , mainly because there 's no case to take . 
  the uk has zero legal obligation to pay money to the eu if it is not a member of the eu . 
  so , how many people are you prepared to lose in terrorist attacks before you think these sanctions are n't worth it ? 
  what order of magnitude are we talking ? 
  because you can be damned sure that we would n't hand intel over to a group that was engaging in sanctions against us in an attempt to extort money . 
  also , whose troops will take over the nato efp in estonia after we withdrew our support for it ? 
  after all , we 're not going to defend hostile countries . 
  i 'm not saying either isis or militant are smart , just that they 've got an idea in common . 
  great minds think alike and morons seldom differ . 
  ca n't actually hear many people laughing . 
  i feel like the indy are reaching here . 
  almost as if their favoured candidate was massively behind in the polls . 
  possibly they 're referring to a couple of chuckles at corbyn 's weird delivery of the final line . 
  well , this is gon na be a long list , but i 'll try to break it down by theme : ** killing the french ** - horatio nelson - of nelson 's column fame , won 2 remarkable naval victories against the french and spanish , beating numerically superior forces at the battle of aboukir bay and the battle of trafalgar , in victories which ensured british dominance of the seas for the remainder of the napoleonic wars and prevented the french invasion of britain . 
  he was killed at trafalgar , and his corpse was preserved in a barrel of brandy , which the crew promptly drank , which gives rise to the phrase ` tapping the admiral ' , meaning having a sneaky drink . 
  - the black prince - edward of woodstock , a general badass responsible for most of the english terretorial gains in the hundred years war . 
  wore black armour , was a founding member of the order of the garter and was a pretty popular bloke unless you were a frenchman . 
  - the duke of wellington - footwear baron , had a small side job as the commander of the british forces in the peninsular war . 
  prevented french capture of portugal , liberated spain and invaded southern france before taking a quick break . 
  then defeated napoleon at the battle of waterloo . 
  later became prime minister , a job at which he was unremarkable . 
  also provided the name to the ` who ? 
  who ? ', 
  government , ( a compromise government comprised mostly of lesser known mps , so named because as the ministers were announced to the house , the duke , who was old and quite deaf , repeatedly shouted ` who ? ', 
  at each name ) ** killing the germans ** - winston churchill - ca n't really miss him off here , his guiding hand got us through ww2 . 
  no jokes on this one . 
  - john ` mad jack ' churchill - no relation to winston .
