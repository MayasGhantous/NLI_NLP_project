  it never achieves anything apart from making people hate you ( and rightly so ) . 
   points out muslims in france  makes ` oh vey the goyim knows ' posts hmmm . 
  it 's almost like antisemitism and islamophobia are done by the same people . 
  gtfo . 
  close but no cigar i guess . 
  you seem like a prime candidate for deportation to the_donald . 
  i guess by ` dealing with muslims ' you mean something like segregation or genocide . 
  we do n't need your idiocy here . 
  t_d might take you . 
  ironically they accept refugees from other subs . 
  did i miss something ? 
  i feel like i slept through the muslim invasion . 
  edit : words, 
  ` wrongly silenced ' can i have some examples . 
  if someone has a opinion so terrible that it offends people they should probably evaluate that opinion . 
  a sex change is the treatment for [ gender dysphoria ] ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/pages/introduction.aspx ) . 
  therefore , these people have been treated and are fit for office . 
  i guess you complained when the u.k. made hate speech illegal . 
  this is n't some conspiracy . 
  they 're just asking you to call them by the correct pronoun . 
  if someone did the same thing to you 'd be pissed . 
  asking to be referred to in the right manner . 
  what 's so terrible about that ? 
  so being denied a job because they said ' i was told that i cant offer this position to your kind ' is n't racism . 
  i think you need some lessons in logic . 
  so your solution to racism is more racism . 
  i do n't think your the sharpest pencil in the box . 
  huh ? 
  do you only argue with enlightened centrists like yourself . 
  thats some / r/iamverysmart shit right there mate, 
  literal white supremacist talking points . 
  btw i 'm white so you ca n't call me a n-word or whatever racial slur is currently in vogue . 
  as opposed to those who died because of the ira or those killed by white supremacists . 
  no-one is calling for all irish people to go back to ireland . 
  its almost like there 's another factor . 
  perhaps to do with the ethnicity of the group involved . 
  oooh anecdotal evidence . 
  how impressive . 
  if i everyone i knew said the world was flat it would become flat ... oh that 's not how that works . 
  what a shame . 
  and japan also has some of the lowest ages of consent in the whole . 
  so do n't paint it as some sort of paradise . 
  treating people differently because of how foreign they are is literally the definition of xenophobia . 
  stop with that fear mongering bullshit about anyone more brown than a can of white paint . 
  white people are nowhere near being a minority in the uk . 
  any sources on that claim ? 
  stop talking out of your arse . 
  damn it . 
  i expected this sort of shit from marxist-leninists but not socdems like abbott . 
  are anarchists the only leftist faction who do n't love brutal dictators ? 
  tbh ancaps do n't translate well into english either . 
   revoke the ban on tabloid newspapers such as the sun or the express . 
  i never said otherwise and i 'll link you to [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a3ot8/happy_victory_day_on_this_day_72_years_ago_soviet/dhc73qm/ ), 
  well firstly that was in 1948 and secondly i 'll link you to [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a3ot8/happy_victory_day_on_this_day_72_years_ago_soviet/dhc73qm/ ), 
  i 'm not going to argue the semantics of the word `` liberation '' with you . 
  i 'm just using the dictionary [ definition ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a3ot8/happy_victory_day_on_this_day_72_years_ago_soviet/dhc4qmj/ ) and if you 're angry about it take it up with them . 
  i do n't have to justify my use of language to you . 
  well berlin was liberated from nazi rule by the ussr . 
  the fact that half of it was then occupied for another 44 years does n't stop the first liberation being a liberation . 
  germany was freed from nazi control before the soviets enslaved them again . 
  liberate in this context  to free ( a nation or area ) from control by a foreign or oppressive government . 
  a more general context  to set free , as from imprisonment or bondage . 
  yes i did nick these definitions from http://www.dictionary.com but they 're quite succinct and i 'm not . 
  well they did liberate berlin . 
  you ca n't deny the facts . 
  from one form of authoritarianism to another . 
  you 're barking up the wrong tree mate . 
   also if you can target nazis for their crimes in ww2 , should n't we also target commies in the same way ? 
  well since antifa are mostly an anarchist group this argument is irrelevant . 
  russians ? 
  really ? 
  are you actually saying antifa is as bad as neo-nazis ? 
  did you miss literally every history lesson about ww2 ? 
  i do n't remember antifa advocating ethnic cleansing of poc or jews . 
  it was n't an argument either but that does n't make your argument any less stupid . 
  opposing nazism does n't make you an extremist . 
  you do n't have to be anarchist or a communist to want to counter-protest neo-nazis . 
  tbh the only requirement is to be a decent human being who does n't want a repeat of the ethnic cleansing the nazis committed . 
  the nazis position is kill all jews , non-aryans , lgbt people and dissents . 
  do n't apologise for a group who would have executed millions for the crime of being born to the wrong parents . 
  how is that an argument ? 
  and the other side returned the favour so do n't act like one side was peaceful and their were n't a few neo-nazis mingling with those free speech supporters . 
  ironic really since antifa is mainly made up of anarchists who where persecuted by communist regimes . 
  oh no that poor white supremacist . 
  like you could do anything about this . 
  just another anonymous internet hardman/women/person . 
   they did not , show me examples if you have any that worked other than capitalism . 
  tbf i have better things to do . 
  if you wanted an actual discussion you would n't have started with an insult . 
  do you see spain being anarchist ? 
   i 'm talking about your pro-commie views . 
  you said yourself that you 're anarcho-commie . 
  not having this discussion if it devolved into insults before it even started . 
  it seems like we 've come full circle . 
  nether of us have got anywhere . 
  life goes on i guess . 
   because that 's the only system that works , you can try communism and some spices in it as much as you want , it will never work . 
  sure because capitalism is such a great system and no other systems of government have ever worked . 
  til remote stateless tribes where actually capitalist , the free territory did n't exist and there where no anarchists in the spanish civil war . 
   all commie countries like ussr , china , cuba , vietnam , n. korea , you name it ended up the same way does anarchism mean something else now ?
