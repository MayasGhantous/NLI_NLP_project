  please educate me on its new meaning . 
  clearly , you have surpassed plebeian level knowledge and have all the facts about everything that ever happened . 
  oh shit i 'd better embrace capitalism and states . 
  perhaps you 'd be at better at home in / r/iamverysmart with people closer to you 're astronomical iq . 
  i bow down to your superior intelligence . 
   it 's not meant to change the mind of hardcore communists and socialists . 
  i consider them lost , frankly , much like i consider the skinhead covered head to toe with white power tatoos lost . 
  it 's to prevent the further spread of such ideologies . 
  again a bit rude but i 'll carry on regardless . 
  you 're actions are n't stopping these ideologies from spreading . 
  if any thing it makes them more obvious . 
  a group of socialists or anarchists marching on their own are going to be more recognisable than if they took part in a unified march . 
  any news media will report it as a socialist or anarchist march . 
  also they could use the fact they 're still marching to show how they 're strong and defiant compared to those who followed the government scheme . 
   i strongly disagree . 
  besides the great purges which killed millions as fast as hitler ever did , not to mention the actual genocides like the holodomor , if your ideology had literal baby-smashing trees , i think it 's safe to compare it to nazism in its brutality again you 're painting me with a brush filled with the blood from ideologies i do n't support . 
  i 'm not a believer in states , communist or otherwise , and i have no desire to defend their actions . 
  however , lets move on  i do n't have a problem with a `` worker celebration day '' , obviously . 
  but may day was widely established , as you correctly point out , after the 2nd internationale . 
  as such , i think it is too intertwined with communism as a symbol , which is still used today ( basically every communist party organizes protests today ) to ever be `` reclaimed '' . 
  may day should be abolished as a holiday and another worker day should perhaps be established . 
  as much as your idea of a new worker 's day sounds nice it seems unrealistic . 
  even if the official celebration moves the original one wo n't . 
  socialists will still follow the second international decision and anarchists wo n't really care . 
  you ca n't use the current state to change the minds of those who view the current state as illegitimate . 
  oh course i oppose the ussr . 
  i 'm an anarcho-communist . 
  the only flag i 'd fly is the [ red and black ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/qt-a_dia.html ) . 
  i have no desire to support communism involving states and people who idealise the actions of said states . 
   that 's different from promoting symbolism of hateful , oppressive , genocidal ideologies like nazism or communism . 
  i 'm not particularly comfortable with that comparison for two reasons . 
  firstly , it paints communism as a singular ideology instead of a set of ideologies ( leninism , anarcho-communism , marxism , maoism etc ) . 
  secondly , for all the horrendous crimes of communist regimes they did n't have nothing on the industrial inhumanity of the nazis . 
   `` may day '' was a symbolic day created by communists and i oppose it propagation and promotion . 
  it should be abolished along with all other remnants in our culture of the ideology of communism . 
  whilst i agree that u.s.s.r and china style communism is terrible and oppressive system that does n't mean you ca n't celebrate workers . 
  after all a labour day was celebrated in the late 1880s by trade [ unionists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_workers%27_day ) years before it was claimed by the socialists of the second international in 1889 . 
  if they can claim it then why ca n't it be claimed again . 
  this sort of thing has already been done . 
  anarchists celebrate may day even tho the people who created it [ excluded ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_international#the_exclusion_of_anarchists ) them from their meetings . 
  in short an event can belong to anyone if you try hard enough to claim it . 
  so what if its a communist holiday ? 
  just because something was created by communists does n't make it evil . 
  you can still oppose something whilst accepting what it 's created . 
  do you boycott satellites because they where invented by the u.s.s.r ? 
  perhaps , because of the sigma around aids caused by numerous attempts to connect it with being gay ala the s * n and other tabloids . 
  perhaps , they 're worried that they 'll be labelled as dirty or degenerate by smug homophobes such as yourself . 
  i 'm guessing macron supports freedom of religion not muslims in particular . 
  i ca n't argue that some muslims are misogynists or that some schools/sects of islam do teach misogyny ( see saudi arabia ) but i can argue that macron has n't come out to support these group 's actions . 
  if he made a speech saying ' i think saudi arabia 's attitude to women is acceptable ' then everything would change . 
  but he has n't so lets stay on topic . 
  when someone says they support religious freedom or a particular religion it is generally assumed that they do n't support everything done in the name of or because of said religion/s . 
  no ones saying that le pen supported the mistreatment of jews by christians because she supports christianity . 
  that would be a ridiculous claim . 
  your 's that macron supports misogyny carried out by muslim or misogyny ` justified ' through the use of islam just because he supports muslim 's right to their religion is equally outlandish and inane . 
  how ? 
  apart from that i oppose mussolini you know very little about my political views . 
  yep . 
  the viruses of populism and racism . 
  you seemed to have contracted at least one of them . 
  fuck off back to the 1960s . 
  that 's not how aids works and you know it . 
  he does n't know . 
  its a shame your father did n't . 
  do you really think everyone who opposes le pen is doing so because of misogyny instead of because of her views , track record and party ? 
  you 're just attempting to shut down any criticism of your beloved candidate . 
  you called . 
  aaand i 'm ashamed to live on the shame island as you . 
  [ you keep using that word . 
  i do not think it means what you think it means . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2y8sx4b2sk ), 
   you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  you 're just repeating what you 've been told . 
  ironic from someone who 's ideology is based on propaganda . 
   modern marxist theorists are not interested in economics , and focus on societal power structures as an anarcho-communist i think know more about communism than some smug prick on reddit . 
   look up pictures of france under nazi occupation has n't it ever occurred to you that those pictures of nazi occupied france where shot by propagandists ? 
  who wanted to make it look nice whilst [ battles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_resistance#guerrilla_warfare ) were being fought in the streets . 
  i think you need a lesson in common sense . 
   looked more french to me . 
  some arbitrary measurement of frenchness by some random illiterate has no meaning . 
  nazi occupation and fascism as an ideology seems to go against those french values of [ libert\u00e9 , \u00e9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libert%c3%a9,_%c3%a9galit%c3%a9,_fraternit%c3%a9 ) . 
   the '' migrants '' flooding into italy would n't have happened under a fascist system . 
  i wonder what happened to italian fascism . 
  oh that 's right they where all [ hung ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snuvlxq17io ) by their own people . 
  it 's almost like you 're on the wrong side . 
   the nazis were the good guys i believe there 's a massive assortment of historians , [ victims ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust#victims_enumerated ) and [ survivors ] ( http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/voices/testimonies/camps/campslanding.html ) who would disagree with you . 
  well there 's you 're claim of  global bolshevism which shows no understanding of communism as a concept . 
  also there your idea that the nazis where not the  bad guys and how the  current situation in europe is worse than living under nazi rule . 
  also since i must have you tagged as a ` nazi ' for posting in / r/pussypass a general failure to understand history , context or life in general is assumed . 
   son , i spent my childhood less than 50 km from the iron curtain . 
  i do n't need some rando memelord on reddit to teach me about communism . 
  clearly you do . 
  i live near a field and that does n't mean i know anything about farming . 
  also being patronising does n't get your point across . 
  aaaand you need a history lesson . 
  please explain how communism has failed when communism ( a stateless , moneyless and classless society ) has never existed ? 
   economic system do you know anything about communism ? 
  ohh been there . 
  did n't get that close to the edge mind, 
  you might wan na charge your phone .
