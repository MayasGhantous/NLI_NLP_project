  well it worked . 
  http://imgur.com/a/h6gca edit : apparently the axis changed . 
  [ nothing else did mind .

  how is no muslims in europe a point ? 
  i doubt you only believe that shit when you 're on the internet . 
   modern practices . 
  says the twat whose post history includes the n-word , antisemitism and race-baiting phrases such as chimp-out . 
  the 1940s called they want their practices back . 
  how about all you muslim haters go find an abandoned island somewhere and live there ? 
  then you could stop complaining about other people existing . 
  also does kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina not exist now . 
  translation ? 
  please . 
  that will grigs song is really annoying mind and the fire service thing was irresponsible . 
  i guess you failed geography . 
  why ? 
  hello mr kettle . 
  all kidding aside stealing is all colonialism comes down to . 
   there was no hunger and poverty in ussr ? 
  how about venezuela if you want better present day example ? 
  oh course . 
  that does n't change the fact that most starvation 's are related to capitalism . 
  i 'll refer you to this statement in my previous comment . 
   p.s. 
  i 'm not actually a communist so if you want a debate try / r/debatecommunism . 
  did this not too long ago . 
  results are pretty much the same . 
  [ libertarian socialism ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=77.4&amp;d=81.9&amp;g=82.3&amp;s=90.2 ) . 
  i 'm an anarcho-communist really but ca n't you expect a quiz to tell you everything . 
   i should reddit less and go out more probably , but there is an esperanto subreddit with 7000 subs . 
  well there 's the bnp . 
  well i doubt there where many racist abolitionists willing to die to free black people from slavery like john brown was . 
  more importantly the original comment said  you must hate everyone born in the first half of the 20th century and before then . 
  because they were all racist , xenophobic and homophobic . 
  so only one example was necessary to disprove that projection . 
   he 's one of the greatest leaders of the uk . 
  who also was quoted as saying  [ `` i am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes ... [ it ] would spread a lively terror . 
  '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/not-his-finest-hour-the-dark-side-of-winston-churchill-2118317.html ) and mentioning how he went off to  [ `` a lot of jolly little wars against barbarous peoples '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/not-his-finest-hour-the-dark-side-of-winston-churchill-2118317.html ) pretty questionable if you ask me  and ? 
  it would be disrespectful to those affected by his actions to only remember him as the war leader without remembering his dark views and brutal actions . 
  well that 's not true . 
  see [ john brown ] ( http://www.historynet.com/john-brown ) a man so not racist that he was willing to die to prevent slavery . 
  you 're just projecting . 
  nope massive racist . 
   without pilsudski poland would have been absorbed like czechoslovakia , without pinochet millions of people in chile would have starved , without mannerheim finland would have been overruned by communists , without tito the yugos would have kileld each other like they did after he passed away . 
  you 're best examples of dictators include a man arrested for [ human rights abuses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indictment_and_arrest_of_augusto_pinochet ) who killed 3000 for being leftists and a [ nazi collaborator ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_gustaf_emil_mannerheim#visit_by_adolf_hitler ) . 
  does n't that say something about dictators ? 
   im not saying those people where perfect , understatement of the fucking year here . 
   but sometimes it needs a strong leader to ensure peace , prosperity or freedom . 
  societies have worked perfectly well without dictators . 
  also is n't it strange how most of the crimes against humanity where carried out by dictators . 
  its almost like its a bad idea to put one person in charge of a country . 
  as the saying goes `` absolute power corrupts absolutely ''  not all dictatorships are bad and not all democracys are good that is true but the fact is dictatorships tend to go `` bad '' a lot more often . 
  you 'd think people would have learned from the last century the problems with dictatorships . 
  but clearly authoritarianism is still alive and well in europe . 
  `` those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it '' seems more relevant than ever . 
  edit : a word . 
  well they are dictators . 
  this should be a bad thing from the offset . 
  it 's like asking `` what murderers do you admire ? '' . 
  the answer should be none because they 're murderers . 
  dictatorships are never benevolent or acceptable and they certainly do n't need glorifying . 
  why is this a question ? 
  not at all . 
  back to being a sort of republican then i guess . 
  i was only interested in the money . 
  provide some evidence to the contrary then . 
  seems a ridiculous claim otherwise . 
  unlucky i guess and if your wondering there 's one prison in andorra . 
  you do n't know that . 
  some [ edgelords stay edgelords ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_kropotkin#/media/file:peter_kropotkin_circa_1900.jpg ) forever . 
  there 's prisons in andorra . 
  i do n't remember scotland being independent . 
  you 're coming as well . 
  making rather shit excuses are we ? 
  that 's cute . 
  motherfucker . 
  well you seem to not have anything else to say . 
  ha you 've run out off insults . 
  also arsehole, 
  no not really i just thought it would be a good way of squeezing a few mil out of them . 
  knob, 
  damn your convincing youtube videos . 
  for the foreseeable future they can say . 
  i 'd still like the palaces to be open to the public mind . 
  if they did n't agree we could charge them even more . 
  its a win-win, 
  hey . 
  nice to see a fellow comrade in the wild . 
  we have a pm for that . 
  i 'm sure may would love to get more free holidays . 
  it 's not like no country could survive without a royal family . 
  no-one is searching for a royal family to wank about spending all their taxes . 
  have you seen our royal family ? 
  the queen gets # 8 million a year . 
  she 's 90 for goodness sake . 
  no-one needs that much money at 90 . 
  the monarchy does n't really do much else . 
  we do n't really need them on a diplomatic scale and they do n't have much effect on daily life . 
  tourists would still buy tours .
