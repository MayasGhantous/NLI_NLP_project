  much of the press - including the dominant axel springer press - has been vocally critical of refugee policy . 
  ( west ) germany has since its inception had the idea of a `` robust '' or `` fighting '' democracy that can exclude anti-democratic ideas from democratic election . 
  you can guess why they put that in the constitution in ' 49 . 
  the general political tradition and climate in germany is just different , which many here just do n't seem to understand . 
  my point here is that germany does n't share the idea that everyone should get to speak their mind equally on a massive national stage and then let that pass without comment or judgement , because germany knows that that can easily lead to catastrophe . 
  the media * does report and analyze events . 
  * they * do * report on negative refugee stories . 
  they just do n't jump on them immediately the way the hard-right media does , in order to give it due verification . 
  in recent months , there 's been tons of negative stories about refugees floating about on facebook and right-wing blogs , and many of them have been total fabrications . 
  in this climate , giving * counterweight to populist rhetoric is a necessary condition for a more truthful picture to emerge . 
  * these critics ' arguments are a product of their confirmation bias and living in the far-right filter bubble . 
  while the nye events specifically went unreported for too long , it 's not good enough to draw conclusions about the state of the media as a whole from it . 
   yes , because merkel and her party are right-leaning ... in theory . 
  and in practice . 
   nice how you can just use the evil ways of the evil people , so long as it 's for a good cause ? 
  not really , but i 'm not using any evil ways . 
  i 'm just stating the facts . 
  sorry , yeah , it was a bit inaccurate . 
  local press and some like focus reported much sooner , but as you can see in all of the articles , the police downplayed it massively for days . 
  yeah i really wonder who the fuck hired this guy . 
  he 's clearly got a pretty hard right agenda to push , and he totally misrepresents the story to do so, 
   did they report the nye incidents immediately ? 
  no , they were only reported days later , which was a major criticism . 
  that said , most of this was due to the police leadership giving out press releases that everything went fine on nye etc , and not making any comment on the crimes whatsoever . 
  they 're a bit like ukip . 
  they started out as anti-eu libertarian , but quickly attracted a lot of disenchanted nativist bigots , and now the nativist wing took over . 
  so it 's not overtly fascist , but strikes a generally far-right populist tone . 
   right-leaning party afd they 're not right-leaning , they 're far-right . 
   there was a time when journalists were held to a level of truthfulness and fact checking . 
  even though a story could be lightly spun to a perspective , the underlying facts had to be true and verified . 
  well , that 's exactly what 's happening in germany . 
  the underlying facts are true and verified . 
  hard-right campaigners are complaining about the focus and slant of coverage , but the basic facts are reported truthfully . 
  did you notice this bit here ? 
  right here :  , critics say . 
  which means the above sentence is not a factual statement . 
  it 's a one-sided argument . 
   so she would have been brutally raped if other men did n't physically restrain him , what a fucking culture ... 
  i do n't get your point - people stepped in to prevent the crime , surely that 's a good sense of protecting people ? 
   you even have an example of it in this thread :  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/40wy40/nach_silvester%c3%bcbergriffen_in_k%c3%b6ln_onlinehetze/cyxtd0x  the guy essentially victim-blames a sexual assult victim and minimizes the actions of the people threatening her . 
  ca n't get much more `` regressive '' than that . 
  yeah and he 's * not on the left . 
  * having talked with this guy on r/de , he 's clearly on the right of the political spectrum ( though not far-right ) . 
   similar to how `` regressives '' blame everything that does n't fit their narrative on racism/nazis/misogyny ( their own pc version of it anyway ) . 
  honestly , 90 % of instances of that accusation would be resolved if people just got some fucking reading comprehension . 
  it 's just bullshit . 
  yeah and that 's bullshit . 
  the `` regressive left '' is a figment of far-right assholes ' imagination , a mccarthyite bogeyman to blame all their grievances on . 
   this is why the naive attempts to enlighten immigrants ( explaining to them that our sexual mores are different , that a woman who walks in public in a mini skirt and smiles does not thereby signal sexual invitation , etc. ), 
  are examples of breath-taking stupidity -- they know this and that 's why they are doing it . 
  they are well aware that what they are doing is foreign to our predominant culture , but they are doing it precisely to wound our sensitivities . 
  the task is to change this stance of envy and revengeful aggressiveness , not to teach them what they already know very well . 
  [ most refugees fleeing war could n't give a flying fuck . 
  ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2016-01/fluechtlinge-arabische-maenner-frauen-gleichberechtigung-koeln/komplettansicht ) he 's right about the ones who rape , but most do n't . 
  it was islamists , not people on the left . 
  but sure , carry on making up your own narrative . 
  ok well you clearly know plenty of good 21st century music then !,

  rhodes is dead . 
  nothing , i usually re-edit my comments for rhetorical effect and clarity . 
  in some subs being flippant works more , in some a calmer way of arguing works more , etc, 
   so , it 's far enough to be removed from his initial investment that it 's not his money , but not far enough to be removed from the man himself ? 
  is n't that a little absurd ? 
  nope , given that the name 's still attached , and that the man 's statue is literally put on a pedestal . 
  things are named in his * honour . 
  * the protest argues that the deeds for which he was `` honoured '' are not honourable and deserve no appraisal . 
  you 'd take down a statue of stalin , would n't you ? 
   why are n't people campaigning to eliminate alfred nobel 's name from his prize , then ? 
  that man set up his prizes literally to clear his name . 
  well , exactly . 
  he repented for wrongdoing . 
  cecil rhodes wanted to magnify his deeds . 
  no , i meant that figuratively . 
  as in : there 's no need for false gratitude . 
  it 's perfectly legitimate to take the scholarship , as well as attack cecil rhodes for being a monstrous imperialist and racist , even moreso than the standard of his time . 
  which is perfectly true . 
  you do n't seem to be familiar with the gravity and inhumanity of apartheid . 
  it 's the fund 's money , reaped from rhodes ' initial investment . 
  while without that investment it could n't exist , i think we 're far enough removed by now to stop thinking we need to fling ourselves before the rhodes statue in gratitude . 
   south africa is broken and a large amount of the native population want apartheid back it 's so bad . 
   wanting a better , more stable government back is not the same thing as wishing institutionalised racism back . 
   you ca n't take the guys money , it 's a fund he set up a century ago , it 's not his actual money . 
  one of these things is not like the others . 
  also you know , you might argue that mandela 's methods were justified by the ends , and that he was vindicated in the end . 
   are you really arguing that the arab world is not profoundly anti-semitic ? 
   this is a very recent phenomenon , and highly influenced by european anti-semitism in its 19th/20th cenutry incarnations . 
  in the middle ages , the arab world was far more tolerant .

    the perpetrators of cologne are not all identified or set by far . 
  but a picture is now emerging that could make the refugee debate in germany become significantly more nuanced in future . 
    among the 19 suspects so far there are no german citizens . 
  nine suspects are illegally in germany . 
  ten people are asylum seekers , of which nine were registered after september 2015 . 
    14 of the 19 suspects come from north african countries , mainly from morocco . 
  only one of them was syrian . 
  for several months , a lot more people have been coming from north africa to germany , said interior minister ralf j\u00e4ger , also stating that not all them are offenders . 
    ** 40 percent of north african immigrants become delinquent **   investigators in many german cities registered for quite some time now a dramatic increase of suspects from north africa .
