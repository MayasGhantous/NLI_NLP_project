  the cologne police registered in 2015 nearly 2,000 suspects from this region . 
    according to statistics of the cologne investigators 40 percent of north african immigrants become delinquent within a year . 
  with syrians it was only 0.5 percent . 
  the numbers refer to how many refugees commit a crime within one year after detection of the illegal residence . 
    in morocco and tunisia families often the eldest son will selected to travel to germany , where he had to earn the money for the traffickers in a short time , interior minister said hunter . 
  many therefore turn to criminality . 
    the investigators also have evidence that the `` taharrusch dschamai '' became known in arab countries under the term `` assault like sexual offenses '' were now imported to germany . 
    ** no evidence that the actions were co-ordinated **   unlike the federal minister of justice heiko maas ( spd ) , who repeatedly spoke of `` concerted '' attacks since new year 's eve , the cologne investigators have so far no evidence that the sexual and violent offenses in cologne , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and other cities were coordinated actions or organized crime . 
  `` investigation results to the conclusion that the appearance of the whole group or part of groups on the occasion of new year celebrations was organized or controlled in cologne are so far not yet available , '' it says in the police report, 
   that blames all men for the cologne sexual abuse no , it does n't . 
  true , but that was an era when there was a paranoid fear of `` papism '' , that catholics in political office would undermine the nation 's sovereignity on the pope 's say . 
  pkk and ypg are secular though , iirc ? 
   he faills to explain why so many other people who live in poverty do n't turn to radical ideology nearly as much as muslims . 
   a ) they do n't have the same identity politics . 
  in the same way that pan-slavism fuelled anti-austro-hungarian sentiment , creating a national identity via radical and violent manichean ideology can be a powerful catalyst . 
  b ) other working-class people do also turn to radicalism - but neo-nazis are n't the same kind of news . 
   what is the proposed solution here ? 
  shower all muslims with money so that they do n't turn into terrorists ? 
  address social problems better - community centres , anti-radicalism initiatives , consider economic impact of fiscal policy also in terms of security policy , fighting racism , counter-information to isis cult propaganda , re-establishing trust in authorities in poor and unstable communities , etc etc. 
   hell , my country took in tens of thousands of easter-european migrants over the last 20 years and we 've barely noticed any problems , they 've assimilated well into the country despite all the hardships . 
  not arguing with you here , but i find it hilarious how eastern european migrants are now seen as model migrants while in the uk , they 're still benefit-scrounding job-stealing underhanded criminal scum to large parts of the media . 
  was the crusaders ' slaughter of jerusalem 's population - including women and children - in 1099 not `` real '' christianity then ? 
  seriously , expression of religion is always culturally contingent . 
  arguing that muhammad did this , ergo all of islam does it is disingenuous . 
  i know a fair amount of catholics , and they basically do n't give a fuck . 
  also , there 's that great story about the world youth day event ( a mass event for young catholics where the pope vists ) in 2006 ( i think ? 
  ) , where the staff were ** outraged ** to find loads of discarded condoms lying around the fields after the crowds had left . 
  tl ; dr [ catholicism works by being told not to do something , doing it , then saying sorry afterwards . 
  then doing it again . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrie6xy3tsq ), 
   i did it for ~ ~ the nookie ~ ~ the caliphate, 
  do you seriously believe catholic heads of state just do whatever the pope tells them to ? 
  what the hell is this , the 1910s ? 
  oh , you . 
  if she resigns , sigmar gabriel takes over . 
  look him up . 
  see what he 's like . 
  i 'm explaining the reason why german people empathise more , not some geopolitical analysis . 
  you 're talking about a completely different frame of reference . 
  also , ~ 60 % come from countries due to which they might have grounds for asylum , last i checked . 
  he 's still wrong . 
  she does n't focus more on immigrants than on germany . 
  you 're seeing this selectively . 
  the political situation of the time changes nothing about the fact that these people had the same refugee experience : losing your home , being on the brink of starvation for long periods of time , settling in unfamiliar and hostile environments . 
  a lot of people who lived through that are marked by it , and can see the same thing happening on today 's migrant trail . 
  well , first off i think she never wanted to or chose the option she thought would harm german people . 
  as for the actual effect : at the moment , it 's causing a strain , but the idea was always that it would be the right thing to do in the longer term . 
  it depends entirely on how able authorities are to step up their game to efficiently weed out the criminal scum and the war criminals . 
  there needs to be concerted efforts to fund integration policy , women 's rights organisations and better anti-sexism laws , civil society initiatives , deportation for rejected asylum applications , information gathering particularly via human intelligence , effective policing , and communication between departments . 
  some of those problems predate the migration/refugee crisis , but all of them are necessary to surmount it . 
  if crime like this continues on a large scale , or integration efforts conclusively fail , there needs to be a u-turn in policy - a government first and foremost owes the people it was elected by its best efforts . 
  until then , it 's owed to genuine , grateful refugees to deliver the refuge promised . 
  i 'm pretty sure that those efforts to them might well be beneficial to society as a whole - culturally , economically , and politically through developing a better understanding of the middle east . 
  but those benefits are n't the point , the point is the principle . 
  yes , there a significant differences . 
  but a ) at the time , east prussians also faced bigotry and reluctance in their new lands . 
  it took time for them to resettle . 
  and b ) there are enough commonalities for german people to empathise . 
  and as for the negative aspects you mentioned : all of these are problems , but they are not universal to the recent arrivals . 
  some of them ( speaking german , muslim culture , education ) it 's possible to overcome . 
   shitting on german law ( telling police in the face `` you ca n't touch me , ms. merkel invited me ! '' ), 
  as of this week , even small crimes make people lose the right to asylum . 
  so literally , they can fuck off right away . 
  just because she does n't pound the nativist drum does n't mean she does n't care about the german people . 
  you have to understand the political context : nobody in germany who is n't a neo-nazi is a nationalist . 
  but not being a nationalist is not about `` wanting to import foreign peoples to improve i.e. 
  eradicate germany 's culture '' , that 's just conspiracy nonsense . 
  i disagree . 
  she has stated that germany will accept refugees ( who by the very definition have a right to be there , if approved asylum ) . 
  it will not grant any rights and deport any other migrants . 
  she has also never argued that that should impede the interests of the german people - criminal asylum seekers ( who commit a crime with a sentence of 3 + years ) already lose all right to asylum , which was tightened this week to * all * asylum seekers who commit a crime . 
  erm , nope ? 
  she 's trying to convey both her anger at the exploiters that co-exists with her shame and guilt for her acts . 
  they 're not mutually exclusive . 
  all of those people ca n't attest to the same process of being duped by cult brainwashing though . 
  this is how isis wins people over , and it 's crucial to the west that their promises get exposed as lies . 
  also , you know , do n't call people whores . 
  she once famously declared multiculturalism to have failed . 
  belief in human rights , including that of asylum , is not wishing your country eradicated . 
  plus , germany have a history of refugees ( post-war refugees from eastern prussia being resettled ) , so it 's a personal issue to do the right thing for many . 
  no , op is just full of shit . 
  dude , merkel is the one who said that `` multiculturalism has failed '' . 
  you 're totally wrong . 
  and basing your argument on an 8-second yt clip with no knowledge of german culture and its sensitivity towards overt patriotism is laughable . 
  i do hope that at least some people care about the facts more than convenient narratives . 
  she never invited , she just said `` we 're upholding our duty to keep human rights , thus treating refugees like refugees , so syrian refugees get asylum '' . 
  she never said `` come here pls '' . 
  if you like bowie , you might like of montreal and broken social scene . 
  i dunno , what do you usually listen to ? 
  yeah that sounds fair enough . 
  but if your kid takes up table tennis , do remember to lock the safe properly . 
  woah there , i do n't even buy that many in counter-strike, 
  oh , i can imagine . 
  saw a documentary on how they got some austrian girl to join them , it sounded very much like a cult ensnaring vulnerable people . 
  woah there . 
  being drunk does not make them `` unconscious to what they did '' or in any way absolves them from responsibility for their disgusting crimes . 
  i 'm saying they 're not fundamentalist islamists , and likely not practicing muslims either . 
  also , it was the higher-ups in the police who did most of the covering up . 
  witness statements were reported before official police sources acknowledged the full extent of the problem , and generally turned out to be accurate . 
  the only criterium for being a scotsman is scottish nationality .
