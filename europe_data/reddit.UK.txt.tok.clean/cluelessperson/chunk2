  i do n't feel superior for saying it , btw - it changes nothing about how evil australia 's actions are . 
   1 ) you 're being a dick too at that point does n't matter . 
  ethics is situational . 
  dickishness of behaviour is cancelled out by usefulness of action . 
   2 ) it implies you ca n't counter their points logically so you 're resorting to name calling . 
  a ) no , it does n't . 
  that 's a fallacy . 
  if you insist the earth is flat , i 'm not going to bother giving you the time of day . 
  it 'd be a waste of time . 
  b ) there comes a point at which `` countering logically '' - i.e. 
  engaging in debate with someone extreme and bigoted on their terms - devolves into them being legitimised and the frame of reference being drawn into dangerous territory . 
  holocaust denial is a crime in germany for this reason . 
   and idk man , there are legitimate issues at play here that are worth discussing sure . 
   money , logistics , asking the `` how '' is the right question !, 
  so yes !, 
   current populations , who takes who , see , this is too often used as an excuse to placate bigots in order to avoid doing a duty to help other humans . 
  obviously those issues need serious consideration and community work , but there 's an overarching imperative to give refugees a haven . 
   why are n't the surrounding arab countries taking anyone , woah there - lebanon and turkey and egypt are - they 've taken * far * more in both absolute and relative numbers than europe . 
  it 's just the gulf states that are letting refugees down . 
   how do the people get vetted before entry , what about isis publicly stating they 're going to sneak in terrorist with the refugees isis wage propaganda war . 
  they 're talking out of their ass . 
  their primary goals are to win recruits and conquer territory - `` sneaking in people '' with refugees is not condusive to those goals , but stoking fear and paranoia and islamophobia will only drive more people into their hands . 
  i could go on but my point is , a lot of those questions have very obvious answers . 
  a lot of those questions are fearmongering . 
  and the people with the largest vested interest in getting them to be the mainstream here are far-right bigots - and they know and exploit that . 
  they use this shit to give themselves a veneer of satisfaction , and then make angry replies of `` why do you want to end our people '' etc , using their now-successful reframing to denigrate and make sane pro-immigration people look like insane pro-immigration people , and taking the sane anti-immigration people along for a ride towards horrible policies . 
   and saying that if you want to discuss the issues and problems with the situation you 're a just bigoted no , that 's not what i 'm saying . 
  i 'm saying that this guy is patently a bigot . 
  and that 's why i 'm calling him that - to not give him the satisfaction of having the semblance of a reframing to make sane voices appear insane . 
  i sincerely believe your sense of perspective is totally fucking ridiculous , i do mean that yes . 
  so what you 're saying is technical precision trumps everything else , including people 's human rights ? 
  not really comparing it in that way ; i was just making fun of / u/deanofpsu 's shitty excuse of `` oh well this totally cruel , human-rights-breaching violent solution at least allows * us * not to worry . 
  oh what , the people affected by this ? 
  who cares ? '', 
  [ just a reminder of what we 're talking about here . 
  australia systematically is violating these peoples ' human rights , in camps where rape and abuse is commonplace . 
  but okay , let 's argue about technicalities of ideology and whether my statement is good enough for academia or something ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lwz52/bbc_news_migrant_crisis_german_anger_at_growing/cva6opt ), 
   way to up the quality of the discussion honest answer ? 
  you ca n't reason with bigots . 
  they lack the basic tenets of humanity that other people can agree on . 
  in this case , the phrase `` thousands of uneducated foreigners flooding europe '' is telling - this person sees no people with lives and hopes , fears , dreams - he just sees a nebulous other , a barbaric danger . 
  they will never be reasoned into a reasonable , humane view ; particularly not on reddit . 
  mocking bigots is a better way of showing them up for their prejudice and spitefulness , and to show others how pathetic it really is by not legitimising it . 
   cancerous lol dude please just stop the src crap . 
  you realise most of src is getting upset over absolutely nothing , right ? 
  oh of course they can , it 's just mostly white people . 
  for reasons . 
  lol, 
  oh , i know . 
  i just wanted to show i 'm talking about the principle of it - which is pretty fascist - rather than just flinging it around for the sake of it . 
  `` propaganda '' sure bc i 'm sitting in the propaganda bureau atm still indicates overall support for letting people in to apply for asylum , would n't you think ? 
  you need money to make the journey . 
  and pretty sure that many are n't willing - given the labour shortages that 'll result of even comparatively small migrations , there 'll be incentives to stay behind, 
  well , the nazis solved their problem with the jews at least . 
  edit : okay , no need to godwin . 
  how about : `` well , [ exclusionist group with power , and with moral claim to and self-identification with human rights ] solved their problem with [ vulnerable group of people whose human rights are now being systematically violated by the first group ] at least . '', 
  dude do n't worry i do n't think you 're a neo-nazi just a petty scared little xenophobe who sees all foreigners as a mush of brown plebs  you people are dangerous , censorious lunatics . 
  top kek, 
   is just the new way srs , srd and cb push their agenda . 
  which is what ? 
  less awful bigotry ? 
  oh noes seriously though , i meant point b ) and c ) 100 % seriously . 
  some cb people are top notch mods , and this sub needs more control over what gets posted , because far-right agenda pushers are hijacking the sub . 
  [ oh yeah , ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/08/australia-inquiry-nauru-immigration-camp-unsafe-150831141816137.html ) it `` solved the problem '' [ alright  ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/opinion/australias-guantanamo-problem.html )  last august , the united nations human rights committee found that the detainees were being illegally held , without proof or judicial protection , in cruel , inhuman or degrading circumstances . 
  a committee report identified some 150 violations of the 1966 international covenant on civil and political rights , which australia accepted in 1980 . 
  it set a feb. 18 deadline for the detainees ' release into australia , on security conditions as appropriate , which australia summarily ignored . 
    the united nations report also criticized australia 's practice of detaining children , including infants . 
  in 2009 , three children under the age of eight were held with their parents at the villawood facility . 
  the report found that detention had severely impaired the children 's psychological development . 
    in making a case for detention , australia 's immigration department relies on a security assessment of each prisoner , covering everything from espionage to terrorism and people-smuggling . 
  the burden of proof is not high ; detention can be upheld even if the a.s.i.o. 
  deems it relatively unlikely that the person under assessment may commit harm . 
  as the organization is not legally required to disclose evidence , little is known about why specific risk designations are upheld . 
  many detainees do not know the grounds on which they are being held . 
  because no court or tribunal can independently test the organization 's claims , it is impossible to know whether the detainees are truly dangerous . 
  oh , right !, 
  yeah , that 's fair . 
  for moderation i 'd argue r/askhistorians and / r/blackladies are better examples of strict moderation being effective , though not 1:1 applicable for / r/europe because they 're kind of different beasts in terms of purpose , size etc. 
   so no , it does n't count . 
  try , try again . 
   dude , i was joking . 
  i get that you 're actually well-versed in history . 
  also i do n't care that much whether i can prove you wrong . 
  i mean come on , you 're just some guy . 
   small userbase sir , less crap gets posted as a result . 
  small , and self-selecting for interest in history and more background in it , and with a reasonable overlap with askhistorians - it 's not just a numbers thing . 
   `` the people on badhistory are aware of the fact that bad history gets posted on there , in fact posts on badhistory are sometimes featured on the sub itself '' i mean , it * is * reddit/not askhistorians , ofc there 's going to be some crap . 
  but they do a hell of a lot better than most of reddit . 
   i now challenge you to find even a single wrong historical fact that i have ever posted . 
  [ here !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/3lkaqo/drama_in_rme_irl_as_users_debate_whether/cv7fpee?context=3 ) you claim there `` were no laws '' criminalising homosexuality in russia prior to stalin , but you fail to mention [ it had to first be decriminalised in the ussr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_history_in_russia#soviet_union ) by abolishing old tsarist criminalisation !, 
  ha , got you !, 
  ... that totally counts , right ? 
  right ? 
  right ? 
  less `` tremendous guilt '' , more `` a reasonable sense of responsibility that comes with a larger degree of historical perspective , as opposed to the uk 's myopic close-minded nationalism informed by pathological xenophobia and a warped sense of history in which the empire was quaint and the big lesson of ww2 was that the british are bloody great '' . 
  most people i see railing against badhistory are terrible at history, 
  / r/shitredditsays a bastion of sanity pointing out bigotry on reddit, 
  yeah that 's a really bullshit metric . 
  srs is literally only there for complaining by design and everything else gets deleted .
