  not really , they 're underrepresented in national politics . 
  particularly eu immigrants - which is the main source of immigration - have basically no political community . 
  no no i agree with / u/onrun , fuck the uk on this . 
  the uk are being a bunch of xenophobic scumbags . 
  hey man i 'm like socrates while trump is mussolini for rednecks, 
   trump_for_prez2016 yeah your political opinions are n't going to be very insightful at all, 
   but oh no . . we have to keep taking more and more . 
  i 'm sick of this shit . 
  500.000 is 0.1 % of europe 's current population . 
  this is totally manageable . 
  because it 's a [ hoax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_protocols_of_the_elders_of_zion ) purportedly showing jews to be actual conspirators for world domination , and is taught as fact in many places . 
  instead of relying on how convincing a text it is like mein kampf , its very `` existence '' is used as a `` smoking gun '' by antisemites of a nebulous `` jewish conspiracy '' , which is a much more potent way to plant antisemitic sentiment in people 's minds . 
  i just mentioned it because iirc the same arrangement ( which as you say , * did * relegate people of other faiths to second-class citizens ) was widely practiced throughout muslim kingdoms . 
   throw in a dash of holy war as well unfortunately ... everything was done in the name of god at the time :( yeah , hence why i deleted that bit , plus i 'm not actually that knowledgable about it . 
  no worries !, 
   we were under the boot of an islamic caliphate and fought to liberate ourselves from it . 
  yeah true , but the berber ( i think ? ), 
  conquerors were pretty tolerant of jews and christians compared to the christian monarchs in iberia , iirc , so there 's room for nuance there . 
  but yeah i agree , not much use making moral judgements on things of that time, 
  i 'm just kidding !, 
  haha , wow evora should really let it go already, 
   in particular we have almost no muslim migrants . 
  oh the historical irony, 
  why not both ? 
  seriously , integration policy is not the hill to ideologically die on . 
  banning the veil is hyperbolic nonsense , and this particular islamic school had been left far too much to its own devices as i 'm sure have some other faith schools ( also , fuck free schools/faith schools ) . 
  integrate people and communities with respect . 
  educate them about the responsibilities that come with the rights , and the rights that come with the responsibilities . 
  figure out how to square off faith customs ( e.g. 
  community led conflict resolution for small disputes ) with the existing framework ( the law - e.g. 
  referral programmes , training programmes for dispute resolvers or something ) . 
  america now has a proud tradition of people going on how they 're polish-american or italian-american or whatever , in a way of building identity that sacrifices neither sense of origin and community nor sacrifices the social , legal and philosophical principles of the country - that 's the end result to strive for , imo . 
  honestly this false dichotomy of dogma just seems totally absurd to me . 
  `` far '' inherently implies radicalism far beyond the broader consensus , and frequently opposition to the entire political system/process . 
  it simply does not apply to the new york times , which is a quintessential establishment publication . 
  for comparison : nobody calls the telegraph far-right , despite it being firmly and unwaveringly conservative . 
  the ny times is more centrist than the telegraph , though still being on the left side of the aisle . 
   it just made your pre-election polls that much more laughable when labour got wiped off the face of the earth . 
  your point here ? 
  a ) they lost clearly , but they 're not `` wiped off the face of the earth '' . 
  b ) the polls were not being commissioned by any party/agenda . 
  they were wildly wrong , yes , but that was due to methodological faults . 
  c ) i 'm not a centrist . 
  i never claimed to be . 
  the ny times is to my right quite frequently . 
  i 'm still not flinging around misinformed , hyperbolic descriptions of political positions i disagree with . 
  honestly , i do n't know which outlets you read but they seem to be beyond the center-right . 
   if you think nyt is n't left wing i 'll just let you be because you clearly have bigger fish to fry . 
  it 's center left . 
  far left would be something like libcom.org or jacobin . 
   moving past the part where you cited an opinion piece from a far left newspaper ... far left ? 
  seriously , i 'm not going to bother arguing with someone that ignorant about politics . 
  also for all your whinging about statistics , your metric is still bullshit . 
  in-flight bombing is not the metric by which to judge terrorism . 
   no it 's not ... unless you use an absurd metric for terrorism in order to skew the results . 
  [ you 're wrong . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/opinion/the-other-terror-threat.html?_r=0 )  last i checked , every ** in flight bombing ** in the last 30 years in the us has been committed by muslims . 
  that 's a very narrow subset of extremist violence , i.e. 
  an unrepresentative metric of the larger issue . 
  the vast majority of those jihadist attacks happened in muslim-majority countries . 
  right-wing terrorism is far more prevalent in the us than jihadist terrorism , in europe it 's separatist violence that 's most prevalent iirc . 
  the use of `` terrorism '' as a blanket term for all those attacks listed is a bit problematic . 
  particularly all of those happening in iraq are practically guerilla warfare that 's not comparable to what western countries experience as terrorism . 
  at least that 's notable in the case of the raf , they definitely got soviet funding . 
   breivik was a lone crazy person , like the unabomber . 
  who are both terrorists . 
   `` terrorism '' has connotations of organization , to me at least . 
  a single jihadist suicide bomber would also be considered a terrorist . 
   otherwise would n't most spree killers be `` terrorists '' ? 
  political goals . 
   if it must involve a political goal , would n't crazy people who assassinate presidents for imaginary political ends count as `` terrorists '' ? 
  not really , as they 're not making as much of an ideological point . 
  breivik was trying to advance a particular political ideology , not just saying `` fuck the system , the president must die '' . 
  someone like john wilkes booth could be classified as a terrorist today , too . 
  you 're right , we should hold people accountable for their descendants ' and compatriots ' actions . 
  better expel all norwegians from norway , considering breivik 's crimes . 
  they found the passport , they did n't find a finger - they only found a finger of the guy born in the paris suburb . 
   one is preferable to the other go fuck yourself , nazi piece of shit, 
  this is n't about the attacks themselves . 
  it was [ fascists ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3suhu9/farright_protesters_who_stormed_silent_a_paris/ ) who were jeered away . 
   the fact that it 's a bunch of `` unrelated '' shit proves how ubiquitous and pervasive it is . 
  local politics , schools , and universities all messed with as soon as they are in sufficient numbers . 
  jesus christ man , get a fucking hold of yourself . 
  muslims in the uk are not a homogenous hivemind . 
  you 're talking about them as if they 're the fucking borg . 
  except [ hindus ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/10/13/448182574/indias-ban-on-beef-leads-to-murder-and-hindu-muslim-friction ) can be [ pieces of shit , too ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/police-indian-girls-aged-en-raped-delhi-151017092246616.html ) . 
  it 's fucking trivial to pluck out a bunch of unrelated shit about any larger ethnicity or religion, 
  it does n't . 
  that 's where you 're wrong . 
   hint : it takes two to tango . 
  have you ever fucking met a normal muslim ? 
   you might want to watch this . 
  explains pretty much everything she makes some really , really bad analogies . 
  not really very convincing . 
  also this is at some crackpot republican benghazi thing , i do n't really trust her judgment . 
   also this is n't any indictment whatsoever of any singular `` evil '' of islam . 
  100 years ago , you would have got similar results in europe . 
  besides , sharia law is a highly diffuse term that effectively means different things to different people ( in the same way , say , every us politician professes to believe in the constitution , but cherrypicks convenient parts of it ) . 
   they are recruited via religion/islam . 
  we need to secularise the population and weaken islam as a fertile ground for terrorist recruitment .
