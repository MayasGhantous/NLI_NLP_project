   [ isis/islamist extremism is not islam , nor representative of the consensus of mainstream islam . 
  ] ( http://www.lettertobaghdadi.com )  they are financed by wealthy middle eastern countries and by those buying their oil . 
  we need to fight their financing . 
  yes . 
   the children of the refugees of today may find themselves in the same situation as the `` homegrown terrorists '' of today , tomorrow . 
  millions of non-extremist immigrant children say otherwise . 
   they hated europe and what it stands for , even though they may have been born here . 
  and you 're not bothering to even think for a second about the real reasons for this , which are well known . 
  spoiler : it 's economic disenfranchisement and systemic racism towards ethnic minorities leading to alienation , which is fertile ground for radicalisation of all stripes . 
  you can find the same effects in far-right extremists . 
   a lebanese minister warned about some weeks ago that 2 out of every 100 syrian refugee is a terrorist . .  citation for that ? 
  also , was he referring to refugees in lebanon ? 
  it 's much easier to travel there ...  trust me there are more . 
  i do n't doubt it . 
  a good reason to help refugees and provide good avenues to integration , to encourage them to tell authorities anything they hear about extremists . 
  most of the terrorists were from europe . 
  but let 's just all ignore that now and slander all refugees as terrorists cause of the one guy , shall we ? 
  doing more against terrorism and a refugee policy in line with the basic principles of our society are not contradictory . 
   islam is an idea and a choice . 
  being born into a religion is not a choice , and heavily biases your decisionmaking later . 
   smear people for ideas and choices you do not agree with . 
  calling an islamophobe an islamophobe is not a smear . 
  a smear would be if i was alleging something unrelated to the subject matter . 
  which i 'm not . 
   trying to equate islam with race is just trying to shift the shaming debate to a place where `` islamaphobes '' can be called racist a ) i 'm not equating them , but they are undeniably very closely linked . 
  b ) shaming bigots is really not a problem , dude . 
  shaming can be a valuable tool to express social discontent with hateful ideas . 
   because being racist is hating someone for something they can not change and hating someones belief in islam is clearly a choice . 
  ex-muslims can tell you all day about the racist/islamophobic shit they get , despite being atheists . 
   also we stopped fucking children long ago and muslims still defend the pedo momo . 
  christians defend king david , a murderer of his lover 's husband . 
  are all christians philandering murderers ? 
  also , do n't be a fucking idiot , most people deal with religion critically and are selective about which religious traditions get carried on . 
  not that marrying 9 year olds ever was a tradition . 
  13 is fine with you ? 
  oh great , good to know . 
   look up `` betrothed '' . 
  you will find it does not mean `` fucking '' . 
  it 's an agreement to get married later . 
   if you 'd have bothered to [ check the source , ] ( https://books.google.com.au/books?id=m_oshrbh0i0c&amp;lpg=pp1&amp;pg=pa12#v=onepage&amp;q=betrothal&amp;f=false ) you 'd know that in ancient palestine , they 're essentially synonymous ( as in , very close to the point of it making no difference to the point i 'm making ) , only limited by the year or so it took to move to the man 's house . 
   this on top of the fact that what you have there is evidence-free speculation . 
  it 's commonplace tradition in that era , soooooo a ) it 's pretty safe to assume that mary got pregnant well below the age of 18 and b ) most contemporaries did it too . 
  every person in the bible is a child-fucker by modern standards . 
  everyone . 
  mohammad is * not * the exception . 
  there 's absolutely no rational basis to single out islam . 
   and that is on top of the fact that mary and joseph 's parents ( or whoever arranged the betrothal , but parents seems likely ) are not considered to be perfect people in christianity the way child-fucker muhammad is considered to be a perfect person in islam . 
  nope , not really . 
  mary is frequently called `` mother of god '' , and is deified to the highest degree in catholicism . 
  she `` gave birth as a virgin '' , i.e. 
  was both a mother and a virgin , making her the purest woman imaginable in theology . 
  she 's as close to veneration of perfection as you can get . 
   religion is not a race . 
   but most muslims are ethnic minorities . 
  most islamophobes are white . 
  it 's totally naive to assume there 's no connection to race . 
   and being islamophobe just means that you dislike the islam there 's a difference between critiquing theology ( e.g. , `` assertions of faith are not sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a god '' or `` halal butchering has nothing to do with meat quality '' ) and ethnic hatred ( `` muslims are all uncivilised barbarians who want to kill us [ the unspoken implication here being we must expel and kill them before they do it to us ] '' ) . 
  islamophobia is the latter . 
   which is no wonder if you have read this book from the child fucker . 
  the entire ancient middle east fucked children , including ancient jews and christians . 
  [ `` this took place when she was already betrothed to joseph and was awaiting the concluding rite of marriage , the formal home-taking ceremony . 
  she married joseph and accompanied him to bethlehem , where jesus was born . 
  according to ancient jewish custom , mary could have been betrothed at about 12 '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mary_ ( mother_of_jesus \\ ) ), 
  that 's what people said about the ni peace process - and yet it happened . 
  if you are n't prepared for `` idealist '' attempts to solve conflicts through political means and negotiations - and remember , we have kurds/turkey/assad / iran/al-nusra/isis / random other rebels as factions all hating each other to some degree - bombing is just doomed to make everything plunge into chaos . 
  there can be no lasting peace without political solutions . 
  if you swoop in with military force , ignore long-term nation building and leave a shitty badly-designed political void , you get another iraq . 
  even if isis is blown into oblivion , there 's too much lingering political conflict for there to be peace in that situation . 
  regardless of your stance on intervention , i think corbyn 's right to demand actual thinking about a political solution and real , productive negotiations where possible . 
  not really . 
  military intervention is n't really there to arrest individuals . 
  well , exactly . 
  well what do you expect from the uk tories ? 
  i 'm sorry , do you mean the * h\u00e1igh * ? 
  i thought it was a legal requirement by now that all high fantasy-ish stuff must have a made up language that resembles bastardised gaelic, 
   thanks springer !, 
  i 'm not quite sure what you mean , but just for reference , spiegel is n't published by springer . 
   is pegida really that consumed with hatred ? 
  having been to a few anti-pegida demos : outside of their hotspot dresden , they 're mostly xenophobes and often have longstanding links to the local far-right scenes . 
   npd they 're literally neo-nazis . 
   afd they 're full of neo-nazis . 
  it 's a really good idea though , because some people shockingly [ do n't have a fucking clue what consent really looks like . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34470205 ), 
  for a start , marriage is constitutionally protected , civil unions are n't . 
  and then there 's some tax and adoption rights that are n't granted , though a lot of those initially withheld have been granted by the constitutional court since life parterships were first introduced . 
  the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_germany ) has a timeline but no direct comparison sadly . 
  just seen you 're swiss , if you speak german the german wikipedia article is much more detailed : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/lebenspartnerschaftsgesetz#rechtliche_unterscheidung_zur_ehe, 
  i do n't think the people on the ground , i.e. 
  working in the overcrowded institutions or volunteers handing out aid , are too naive - they 're probably those most aware of the acute problems . 
  pretty sure she 's okay with men generally , and that she does n't * actually * want to kill all white men . 
  dude who said that is 19 . 
  he was naive to expect that , but a lot of people are naive at that age . 
  ca n't believe those entitled migrants want to impose their customs on the good german leitkultur !, 
  / s you 're right , but at least there 's registered life partnerships , which is definitely an improvement . 
  a lot of this is pretty grim , but there 's also some really heartwarming stuff :  `` we went back to lageso and i met one german girl . 
  i told her i was with my boyfriend and that we did n't want to go back to the camp because they will notice [ that we are gay ] and it is dangerous . 
  she introduced me to another girl who prepared for us a place to stay near lageso . 
  we told them about being harassed once for holding hands during our journey to berlin and said we were still afraid of being hurt . 
  she helped us find a place and gave us money for shoes . 
  she also helped us buy bus passes and looked over our documents .
