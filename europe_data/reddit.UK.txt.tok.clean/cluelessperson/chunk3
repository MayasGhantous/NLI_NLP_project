  all other discussion is moved to the other srs * subs like srsdiscussion , srsgaming , etc, 
  i 'm sorry but i totally disagree . 
   `` give it here , cb is literally srs-lite , i 'll clean it up good ! '', 
   a ) those are jokes . 
  they 're a reference to the beautiful transformation from / r/punchablefaces from an awful place into one massive , glorious troll . 
  b ) many cbers * are * hardworking , quality mods , like / u/godofatheism . 
  c ) i and many others would welcome those measures . 
  this place has become a one-sided , biased , borderline far-right place that gives a totally skewed and unbalanced view of big issues . 
  australian immigrant camps are [ well-documentedly awful ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/08/australia-inquiry-nauru-immigration-camp-unsafe-150831141816137.html ) and should not be copied . 
  austrlalia is disgustingly fascist in that respect . 
   tens of millions . 
  lol, 
  and 80 % agree with current immigration policy . 
  it 's not like the uk , where `` immigration is an issue '' is a euphemism for `` get the fucking migrant benefit scrounging job stealing muslamic eu scum out '', 
  i mean , i find myself shouting `` racist ! '', 
  a lot at people ( because there are a lot of racists around ) , but anyone working to make the system work and actively help refugees is on the right side of things at the * very * least . 
  it 's mentioned in the article . 
  organised crime gangs in turkey i 'm guessing , or does turkey have no crime ? 
  jeez dude [ stop getting all offended ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3llj1d/reurope_mod_asks_rcirclebroke_for_advice_on_how/cv7b7l3 ) all over the place, 
   using words like gamble , making assumptions about the motives of the parties involved ... that 's par for the course of all uk political journalism , i really do n't understand your problem here . 
  people talk * a lot * when they are n't supposed to . 
  people are n't clever . 
   heres a nice src post i have no idea why he has been left as mod , and why he has n't been told to stop repeating everything in french , it is just spamming . 
  lol src also , get a grip . 
  writing it in french is his right to do if he wants to . 
  nobody 's forcing you to learn french . 
  you 're just getting all offended over the most trivial bullshit, 
  not to defend smuggling , but did you even read the article ? 
   altogether , he says he has sent 8,000 to 9,000 people to italy and greece in the last two years `` without a single sinking or drowning '' . 
  i mean , fair enough to take this with a pinch of salt , but he at least seems to care more than the turkish mafia . 
   why not arrest the people smugglers it said in the article , he 's already on the interpol watch list - it 's just he 's been able to bribe his way out of any trouble so far . 
  a ) that mod has been de-modded just for * asking for better procedures to handle obvious non-community spam , * and b ) they 've been banning people for racist grandstanding and flooding the front page with low-quality content . 
  this , on the other hand , is a legitimate source and an in-depth , well-balanced article , it 's not likely to get deleted at all . 
  is this guy relevant ? 
  does anybody care ? 
  does he hold any sway in europe whatsoever ? 
  in europe , you can give them work permit , from which they can contribute to the economy , gain training , jobs , pay taxes , etc. 
  also , i was n't arguing against the camps - they are vital . 
  but they 're likely to not be enough , and are chronically underfunded . 
  in the warzone , they had constant anxiety for their lives , but they had their home and belongings . 
  now , they have their safety , but they only have what they can carry , and 3000 of them are crammed in a space for only hundreds of people . 
  that does n't exactly inspire ecstatic jubilation . 
  try buying food , sanitary products , and other everyday things for [ 80,000 people ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/settlement.php?id=176&amp;region=77&amp;country=107 ) , plus adding on some for infrastructure and paying the administrative and security personnel , plus training them for conflict resolution and development etc. 
  and then keep that going over the span of years . 
  that costs a fuckton . 
  it 's not too late to implement those things to at least alleviate problems with further migrants - and counter the smuggler 's profiteering and lies of `` oh europe is great you 'll find great work and a house of your own in no time '', 
   the sensible solution was to make camps and aid them in the middle east those camps are turning into cities , and are economically unsustainable unless they 're given proper development effort - and budgets are falling . 
  the sheer scale of the conflict in general is a massive challenge for direct relief efforts : /  if people had real expectations of how humanity generally acts , the immigration influx would have been kept moderate it could have been kept moderate - or at least manageable - if a quick , coordinated , transparent process had been in place , as well as widely available information about the process advertised to refugees . 
  `` they hate us for our freedom , they love us for our benefits '' man your dumbass worldview sure is cosy is n't it, 
  some caveats : it 's a pegida blog , quoting a right-wing ( canadian ? ), 
  blog , which does n't link to its source . 
  it 's also not the exact same flag as wikipedia lists as the al-nusra flag - there 's a bit at the bottom missing . 
  given that many jihadist groups just put the islamic confession of faith on the flag plus a few addons , it might be the crucial difference . 
  that said , the other flag does look like a legit isis flag . 
  but again , no link to the original source . 
  i 'd honestly have to have that confirmed by better sources ( and people can read arabic ) to buy it fully , but fair enough , reason to be wary . 
  i 'm not arguing anything controversial here , what the fuck is wrong with you ? 
  asylum seekers look for work and better chances of getting it , not a life on welfare . 
  risking death on the boats ( which is what i was referring to when saying `` death '' ) is not worth it for shitty benefits in expensive countries . 
  i 'm not even arguing `` we should take in immigrants '' anything , wtf, 
  my point is they do n't come for welfare . 
  jesus , is my sentence really that ambiguous ? 
  source on that ? 
  if the eu had a proper common immigration policy , problems like these stemming from overcrowding would arise far less . 
  passing the buck and blaming everyone else is making everything worse . 
  universities . 
  job opportunities . 
  in many cases , their family . 
  yeah that 's not entertainments . 
  get a hold of yourself, 
  op literally lied and i 'm one of those people ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  [ he was a football coach . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/world/europe/syrian-refugee-tripped-by-hungarian-journalist-is-welcomed-to-spain.html ), 
   there were other people found by their facebook accounts like this who are already in germany , etc. 
  a week or two ago ( photos of them as both isis fighters and being in germany as a refugee ) . 
  source ? 
  is this that fsa fighter again ? 
   all for welfare ? 
  that 's the important bit , which contains the point i was making . 
  they 're not coming for free money . 
  they 're coming for work , to be part of a stable society . 
   theybare fleeing poverty oh sure , because serbia is willing to accept them ? 
  because they 're likely to be integrated well and welcomed by those governments ? 
  because middle-class syrians with degrees will totally be able to carry on a middle class life in a country with a gdp per capita a multitude smaller than germany - which also has a demography problem and needs young people ? 
  it 's a totally reasonable thing to do , stop acting as if you would n't do exactly the same thing . 
  moral grandstanding about `` how come they do n't accept living in refugee camp shitholes the ungrateful scum , how dare they not live in dickensian squalor '' helps nobody except the fascists . 
  he came to rebuild a life , i.e. 
  work . 
  not welfare . 
  work . 
  you realise a lot of the other countries are less inclined to give him asylum status , work permit , etc ? 
  they 've heard germany and sweden allow you to work , so they go there . 
  bullshit , it 's far-right brigades . 
  thousands of miles and risk of death , all for welfare ? 
  oh yeah sure , that 's a likely story . 
   `` here is my list of demands for facilities and entertainment . 
  and be speedy about it ! '', 
  show me the quote where he demands that ? 
  oh no you ca n't , because you 're talking out of your arse .
