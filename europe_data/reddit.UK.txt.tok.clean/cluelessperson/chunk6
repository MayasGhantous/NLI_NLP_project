  that 's not his point . 
  what he 's saying is `` asylum seekers do n't want to work , they want to laze about on welfare and not work like the lazy fucknuts they are '' . 
  which is absurd and wrong , given how the european cost of living and widespread austerity has made living on benefits incredibly uncomfortable , even in western countries . 
  besides , it 's absurd to believe immigrants would travel thousands of miles , risk death and injury , and take their family/try and get them over all in order to live on benefits . 
  these people are looking to build or rebuild their lives . 
  he 's just making up a shitty strawman of lazy , undeserving migrants in order justify his hatred . 
  it 's effective because you ca n't prove the latent motivations , that 's why it gets used all the time . 
  benefit scrounging migrants in the uk , lazy scrounging greeks in germany , etc. 
  not with a european cost of living it is n't . 
  what if they - quite likely - have german citizenship ? 
   but if integration was that easy , how come you still see a clear division between turks and non-turks in germany ? 
  because they realise they did n't do enough for turks in the mid 20th century , but now have more experience of other cultures . 
  learning from failures . 
  what , turks ? 
  they came to germany a * long * time ago . 
  well , that 's my point . 
  eu immigrants as a whole collect less than native brits - and yet the uk right * never ceases * to spout shit like i posted above . 
  whenever people go `` people are just coming over here to scrounge '' , they 're making up total bullshit that has no bearing on reality , and it 's strategically used to keep people out for reasons of sheer bigotry and prejudice . 
  i just thought the irony of a polish person saying it was pretty crass , given they should be aware of how these bullshit stereotypes are used against their compatriots . 
  what should germany do , expell all * 4 million * turks ? 
  obviously it 's not great and there needs to be work done towards conflict resoluton , but it 's not the end of the world . 
  in the grand scheme of things , it 's fairly minor . 
  and i 'd guess that it 's mostly a fight among long-term expats , anyway . 
   they say that hungarians treat them well , they also say the hungarian government does n't . 
  later on in the film , one guy mentions he has family in germany . 
  bit rich you polish complaining when you come over to steal our benefits ... . see how this works ? 
  it 's bullshit . 
  nobody takes up that much hardship to live a shitty life on benefits, 
   which is why you see planned parenthood stings release the full hours of videos now to though . 
  ... which was also heavily edited to the point of distortion, 
  [ they were notorious for this ( what i was referring to ) beforehand . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breitbart_news_network#acorn_undercover_videos ) that said , carlos danger was fucking hilarious . 
  if it 's so luxurious to live on welfare in poland , why do you keep sending over your people to scrounge off * our * welfare ? 
   breitbart reporting about this ( idk how reliable that is ) breitbart is super right-wing , and infamously doctored videos when they got their start . 
  as for turkish/pkk clashes , they 're quite minor and happen from time to time in germany , plus they 're part of a different conflict ( turkey vs. pkk ) that does n't get that much attention , so a lot of news media just do n't bother . 
  context : austrian newsreader . 
  `` according to a worldwide bbc poll , the most popular countries on earth are 3 , the uk ; 2 , canada ; and at number 1 , germany . 
  no joke . 
  the weather ... '', 
  not disputing the age dude , it 's just that you immediately jump to the conclusion of their primary purpose/motivation/whatever being for * fighting *, 
  [ daily stormer 's words , not mine  ( https://archive.is/vgkh8 )  other fertile grounds for recruitment on reddit are the european-dominated subreddits -- in particular , / r/worldnews , / r/worldpolitics , and / r/europe . 
   do n't you think it 's rather odd that 75-80 % of these refugees are men of fighting age ? 
  yeah there 's the odd woman and child but for the most part it 's just men fleeing . 
  if they 're granted asylum , they 're allowed to fly their family over . 
  which is much safer than having them risk the trip . 
  also , nice little trick inserting `` fighting age '' there . 
  he did quote a news story about it , but it 's a few months back and i 'm too lazy to look for it . 
  also , it 's far too funny a story to not blindly believe . 
  well it 's not all lies , it 's just what is `` newsworthy '' and gets attention , and the problem of the real story not being necessarily told best through event-based reporting . 
  `` refugees doing alright , getting along in german refugee shelters '' is n't anything that 'd get people 's attention that easily , particularly on reddit . 
  yeah i think he meant that , or `` untermenschen '', 
   plus , we have to take his word as true . 
  i mean , its not the best timing to go marching with huge mass of people , what else can they do ? 
   i 'm sure there are legal ways to apply to get reunited with your family not if you * have * to get refugee status in the first place you end up in . 
  being told that 's not the case anymore , you 'd take your chances too , right ? 
  fight stormfront by doing exactly what stormfront want ? 
  yeah , no . 
  that 's cowardice . 
  it 's better to do activism against the far right , as well as for helping refugees integrate into the social fabric . 
  dude , he 's talking about how he to accepts his fate . 
  how is that in any way objectionable ? 
  would you care if a christian said it ? 
  do you even listen to yourself ? 
  300 is not a large number of people in the scale of things . 
   now , these illegal immigrants refuse to be registered in denmark . 
  to them , only sweden is acceptable . 
   a ) these are a self-selected group , ie the ones that wanted to go to sweden in the first place . 
  you do n't see any of the other migrants that settled/dispersed . 
  [ this guy  ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/reporters-notebook/migrants/denmark-refugees )  but ismail qaedi , 19 , from shiraz , iran , who has studied computer science , said he was resigned to staying in denmark . 
    `` this is good police , '' he said . 
  `` but the hungarian police is very very bad . 
  i will stay here . 
  this is the way god show to me . '', 
  b ) the reason people go to sweden is , in many cases , relatives that live there . 
   `` we have no problem with the danes , but our families are in sweden , '' said jaafar alaawi , 62 , from baghdad . 
  `` what am i supposed to do here ? '', 
   [ but however clean this danish gymnasium may be , this is not where the majid family expected to be today . 
  they had thought they were so close to their goal , and now there is no telling when they will reach it . 
  they expected to be in malm\u00f6 , sweden , this afternoon , ** on the way to join relatives . 
  ** ahmad majid was already talking about the middle eastern grocery store he would open with his brothers . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/reporters-notebook/migrants/denmark-refugees ), 
  they want to get to relatives in sweden . 
  it says it right there in the article . 
   accomplishing their goal of leeching off of sweden 's benefits teets . 
  what in the report indicates they want to do that ? 
  pretty sure most people come to europe to work , life on benefits - given the cost of living - sucks . 
  did you read the bit where they mentioned they have family there , and want to be reunited with them ? 
  i think / u/walt _ ua once mentioned a russian news story about crying east-ukranian cows so scared of the evil kiev nazis they could n't shit any more, 
  this . 
  it 's a running theme in the [ ny times ' reporting on this , ] ( http://nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/reporters-notebook/migrants/ ) too . 
  also , you do n't notice the migrants who stayed in various countries because that 's not news , so the only stuff that gets reported is the chokepoints where it seems like the situation 's worse than it is . 
  stormfront have been trying to recruit here for a while , actually, 
  man those jews that fled poland were such cowards in ww2, 
   muslims , eritreans and nigerians who just all happen to be non white . 
  he even fucking specified the latter two, 
   do n't call me friend , traitor . 
  lols , whatever you say , mate  can you imagine how your grandfathers would feel about what you are condoning ? 
  what , basic humanity ? 
  helping refugees ? 
  fine , really .
