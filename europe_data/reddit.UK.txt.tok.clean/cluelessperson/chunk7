  yup . 
  that is what i was saying . 
  a + reading comprehension , friend . 
  you realise the * school * did that on their own initiative , right ? 
  and they were fucking stupid for doing it , yes . 
  nobody 's asking you to give it up . 
  it 's not under attack . 
  this whole attack thing is a white nationalist fantasy, 
  really ? 
  does n't sound alarming to you ? 
  or do you already support pegida ? 
  also , nobody 's asking you to give up your culture . 
  besides , the amount of refugees is nowhere near enough to be anything resembling hegemonic . 
  you realise the people coming from syria are fleeing the extremists , right ? 
  isis has no reason to join the trail , which is dangerous , hard , expensive and potentially fatal - they want controllable land and recruits . 
  it 's cheaper and safer to get the latter via the internet and already existing extremists , and the only land they are able to hold atm is where they have control - syria , iraq , and their allies boko haram 's northern nigeria . 
  no christianity = no child abuse by priests easy peasy, 
  maybe , but / u/laboe is basically spouting dog-whistle white supremacism . 
  just look at it : `` what is happening right now to defend our continent '' and `` to my eastern european brothers , i say , fight on . 
  you 're not just fightning for yourselves , you are doing it for all of us . 
  one day you may need to liberate our countries up north '' . 
  it 's loads of militaristic black and white imagery , and it 's pretty clearly all about us white europeans ( he even says `` brothers '' !, 
  translate it into german and tell me it does n't sound v\u00f6lkisch as fuck ) vs. the evil brown/black horde invading us . 
   but understand that brothers do n't need to reward brothers for acting like family . 
  supporting and protecting one another is what we do . 
  it 's who we are . 
  keep going man , this is bringing tears to my eyes man you creeps love your v\u00f6lkisch kitsch, 
  yeah and you have reliable statistics to back up all muslims do those on a regular basis , right ? 
   we have created an incentive for them to come . 
  you misunderstand what that incentive is . 
  people will always want to make that trip , because a ) europe is rich and stable and b ) the places these migrants come from in africa and the middle east are poorer not just because of economic factors , but also are rocked by complex wars and climate change destroying resources . 
  these migrants do n't know anything about the ins and outs of benefits , but they do know that europe is wealthier on the whole . 
  that 's their hope - they reckon if they risk the trip and work , they can make it into a decent life . 
   if you are not willing to remove that incentive then the only other moral action is to set up a ferry service which will bring people safely from northern africa and the middle east into europe . 
  better political solutions to refugees - giving better official channels - are preferable , yes . 
  it also makes it controllable . 
   africa 's population is going to double to 2.4 billion people within 40 years and many of them will want to live in europe . 
  refocus development aid and political relationships . 
  better aid like family planning efforts , etc etc, 
  dae literally all of le islam = = salafism and fgm all the time ??? 
  not even hiding the islamophobic racism , good job, 
   defend our continent `` defend '' ? 
  like , defend from an invading army defend ? 
  man , those unarmed refugees fleeing warzones with looking to rebuild their lives sure are , like , the new ottoman empire . 
  seriously though , take your racist sd ass and fuck off . 
  there , some nice old uk politeness on display . 
   give illegal migrants no state benefits or housing , do not allow migrants to legally work , place extremely harsh punishments in place for employers who employ illegal immigrants or landlords who rent them homes . 
    ` moral cowardice ' oh the irony of lectures in morality coming from someone who wants to incentivise letting people die . 
   they spent 13 years importing poor people increasing their share of the vote . 
  from the eu ? 
  those immigrants were mostly white , right ? 
  that looks like a well dodgy source , but you 're right , i misremembered it . 
  [ this is a better overview ] ( https://fullfact.org/factchecks/race_and_sex_offences-27153 ) . 
  that said , the overrepresentation of asian people in grooming ( i.e. 
  child sexual exploitation by strangers ) might explain why people talk about this as an issue more , as that 's what gets headlines . 
  also , this [ mirror ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/rotherham-report-what-most-sex-4118199 ) article points out that in the rochdale case , the public services often had complaints of a sexist internal climate , which is something that can contribute to people not believing victims . 
  those that do suck . 
  [ you ca n't trust people , jeremy .

  ~ ~ proportionally , more convicted sex offenders in the uk are white , iirc . ~ ~ misremembered , sorry, 
   did not make sacrifices like the genocide of native americans . 
  totes great sacrifices for heroic causes . 
  i know he 's a racist , i just thought i 'd have some fun pointing out how ridiculous he sounds . 
  sadly , it seems a lot of people here are actually tone deaf : /, 
  sure , someone speaking urdu and someone speaking syrian-accented arabic will be impossible to tell apart . 
  and somalis totally look like syrians , too . 
   white organized crime spans continents . 
  yeah i loved that bit in gangs of new york where the gangs controlled turf spanning continents . 
  good old white crime , all sophisticated and proper . 
   also , from what i could actually understand of the music video , it seems like he 's talking about a woman he was banging at one point . 
  what , like a. . . relationship ? 
   but that song does n't necessarily reference sex or anything else , so i 'll hand this point to you . 
  95 % of black music is about sex , drugs , gangs and violence and money . 
  blues , jazz , modal jazz , free jazz , violent degrading hip hop like sugarhill gang , public enemy , mos def , they all talk about bad stuff . 
  not like good family-friendly artists like [ led zeppelin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqmmm_qwg4k ) or [ the rolling stones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmfi3ubdpnq ) , or [ the velvet underground . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xcwt9msbye ) , or [ mozart . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c78hbp-youk ) and white people do n't [ sing about money , either . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czle8r1bl4c ) and good old composers would never * dream * of making [ references to orgasm . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlohcb8a63m ) also , seriously ? 
  what on earth is wrong with songs about sex ? 
  it 's a normal part of human life , ffs . 
   poverty is something that can be overcome , yet they either do n't try hard enough , do n't care enough , or apparently they 're being held back by the `` man '' . 
    all i know is , a black guy is walking down the street , a cop tells him to stop doing something , the black guy attacks the cop very violently , to the point where the cop 's life is in danger , and he cops shoots to kill in self defense . 
  to this end , the parents of the black child say `` he was a good boy , he never did anything wrong , he was an angel blah blah '' ( mind you he just got finished robbing a store ) . 
  and suddenly the black community uses this whole shitshow as an excuse to go out and rob and pillage the local community they live in . 
  okay , hold on . 
  take a step back . 
  read the two articles i linked to you , please . 
  the first one in its entirety , the second one at least a good chunk of . 
  the long and short of it is that whether you 're white or black , you ca n't `` just overcome poverty '' - the poorer you are , the more likely you are to fail . 
  you need 10 % will and 90 % pure fucking luck to make it from a dishwasher to a millionaire . 
  and as for michael brown : you do n't understand what happened until you bear in mind the context in which it happened , and the confusion surrounding the exact events in the immediate aftermath . 
  so , as i said , please go and read those articles . 
  how much racism/bigotry/prejudice d'you reckon they get on a day-to-day basis , respectively ? 
  apart from the media attention and hip-hop as an art from rising from it , how is black poverty different from white poverty ? 
  how is black organised crime different from white organised crime ? 
   i ca n't fathom how racism from whites tells blacks to kill , steal , poverty . 
  which , as i 've shown in the links , came about because of systematic racism by white-controlled power structures . 
   have sex with anybody oh no sex the worst thing ever . 
  also , if you happen to mean this stereotype , nowadays absent fathers are rarer among black people than other minorities .
