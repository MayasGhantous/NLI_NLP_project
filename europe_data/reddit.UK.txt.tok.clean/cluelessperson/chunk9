  the number of refugees arriving in europe - which is still a tiny amount relative to europe 's overall size - is nowhere near enough to form anything capable of implementing isis ' goals in the area , even if literally all of them were secret isis fighters . 
  [ and furthermore , it 's pretty fucking obvious that it 's mostly refugees . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/06/refugees-budapest-life-stories-europe-keleti-station ) so how safe do i feel ? 
  pretty fucking safe . 
  how would i feel safer ? 
  if my government did everything it could to give these people a life in dignity and integrate them into the social fabric as quickly as possible . 
  language courses , participation in communities , allocation of resources spread around to prevent ghettoisation and white flight , help in bringing previous training and education in line with european standards . 
  all it takes is the will to do it right . 
  first of all , you 're framing this as attitudes being governed by totally rational decisionmaking . 
  that 's wrong . 
  people who oppose immigrants have no idea what immigration looks like , and consistently vastly overstate the number of asylum seekers . 
  opinions on this are more governed by anxiety than by actual economic fact . 
  also , the class gap in immigration attitudes has been closing in recent years . 
  so no , income does n't actually account for significant divergence in being pro/anti * anymore * - although it does account for differing reasons . 
  [ see page 10 in this report .

  i do n't understand what you 're saying , could you rephrase that please ? 
  assuming you mean that the effect only holds for eu migrants , quoting the article i linked : `` both immigrants from europe and outside europe are less likely to claim benefits than native brits . '', 
   the one we 're living in ? 
  i did describe it as a dream , remember . 
  do you recall that these people were desperate to escape from hungary ? 
  what were they fleeing from at that point ? 
  what were they running to ? 
  first off , [ immigrants claim less in benefits and contribute more to the economy than uk natives . 
  ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/how-many-immigrants-claim-benefits-4712170 ) they come for work and study . 
  [ and as for why they 're moving on from hungary , well ... ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=hungary+gdp+per+capita+vs+germany+gdp+per+capita+vs+uk+gdp+per+capita ) also , you do know that [ hungarian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_language ) is part of a [ really rare language family ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-ugric_languages ) that is unrelated to most other european languages , [ has a rabidly anti-immigrant autocratic pm , ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-why-hungarian-prime-minister-viktor-orban-sticks-to-his-antimuslim-script-10487494.html ) and was deceiving refugees into being deported into camps , right ? 
  sticking around to work there is by any measure kind of a bad idea as a muslim refugee , even a skilled one . 
   so you 're telling me that as the proportion of immigrants in an area increases , the amount of people in the area who object to immigration falls ? 
  oh gee i wonder why that may be . 
  the effect is observable among white britons - natives who experience immigration are the least likely to oppose it , except in areas of exceptionally high deprivation/unemployment and skills shortage . 
  [ quoting from page 13  ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/assets/docs/publications/sri-perceptions-and-reality-immigration-report-summary-2013.pdf )  figure 14 confirms that white britons living in the `` superdiverse '' and `` cosmopolitan london/periphery '' clusters are least likely to want to reduce immigration a lot , whilst `` northern manufacturing and industrial towns '' and areas of `` low migration '' are amongst the keenest to see immigration reduced a lot ( as seen in other work , areas with less experience of migration tend to be more worried ) . 
  thanks , france . 
  ^ ( thance . ), 
   knowing that they would have a shot at living out their welfare dreams . 
  in what kind of fantasy land do you live where hundreds of thousands of people travel literally * thosands of miles * in squalid conditions to follow their dream of living on welfare in a country that 's expensive as fuck ? 
   the news would be full of images of middle class europeans who get to live in areas far away from where the new arrivals will create their cultural ghettos cheering and welcoming the crowds of `` refugees '' . 
  you realise anti-immigration sentiment is far higher in areas where there 's none at all , right ? 
  nope . 
  the eu 's economies would take hits , and france/germany/uk would have to start finding ways of getting migrant labourers to come over . 
  trade would suffer . 
  and if people start giving asylum to ukrainian refugees but not me ones , pretty sure that would adversely affect perception of europe across the world , and lead to less diplomatic cooperation with european countries ( and thus hinder multilateral institutions/undermine their authority ) . 
  so what you 're saying that it 's just a hunch based on little concrete evidence , that happens to make headlines because it fuels paranoid right-wing fantasies of a full-scale islamist invasion . 
  got it . 
  do you have any sources to back that up ? 
   they do n't react to kind words . 
  did they even try that ? 
  yeah . 
  yeah , it really is . 
  particularly if they are there to fence you in and push you into going places . 
  particularly if you 're coming from a war zone . 
  oh right , sorry , i understood `` benefits '' to mean welfare state benefits - it 's a synonym in the uk , and it 's a commonly held ( and false ) myth among right-wing parties that immigrants mostly come to not work and just claim welfare . 
  which is not really the case . 
  misunderstood what you were saying there , i take that back . 
  but yeah , given the middle east is volatile as hell and syrian refugees in e.g. 
  jordan are living in horrible conditions , and turkey just restarted their war on the pkk and is generally hostile to kurds , wanting to go to the eu - and within that , to places that are n't as strongly anti-immigrant as hungary - is a totally reasonable wish imo . 
   could you post some sources corroborating this ? 
  i 'd imagine it 'd be a fairly difficult task to determine the true originating nation each person was a member of . 
  [ 38 % are from syria . 
  62 % are refugees , i.e. 
  fleeing war , dicatorship , repression . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/10/10-truths-about-europes-refugee-crisis ) also , language , accents , ethnic traditions etc are big indicators for starters . 
   how do you get a handle on things , especially when they are so uncooperative ? 
  get translators . 
  talk to them . 
  get social workers to work with them to provide for them . 
  implement a coherent immigration policy , eu-wide , both for prospective refugees in camps and for the refugees currently in europe , to deal with them efficiently and win their trust . 
   really appears to be at face value a majority of them are able-bodied young males without a family . 
  dude , just read the new york times migration reporting . 
  while there are many of those , there are [ many many families , too ] ( http://nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/reporters-notebook/migrants/ ) - it 's just that the young men tend to undertake the more risky , headline-grabbing ventures . 
   you are owed nothing , entitled to nothing . 
  every human being is entitled to a life in dignity . 
  or , as the german constitution i think puts it very nicely : the dignity of man is untouchable . 
   maybe you should host a family or twelve of refugees . 
  you realise that if refugees were spread across the continent , people could host less than a refugee each ? 
  europe has 500 million inhabitants , it is entirely capable of absorbing them properly and well - while also simultaneously doing something to help end the root causes . 
  thanks very much for that , could you perhaps submit some stuff on swiss immigration/integration policy to the subreddit ? 
  it 's getting swamped by `` we cant deal '' right-wing hysteria at the moment : / also , if switzerland 's so cool about immigration , how come it banned minarets ?!, 
  i mean , they banned * all 5 of them *, 
  oh , like the ones [ where the guards beat and rape the refugees ? 
  ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/exmanus-island-workers-report-beatings-rapes-of-asylum-seekers-20140505-zr4uv.html ) the ones [ senate investigations called inadequate and unsafe ? 
  ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/08/australia-inquiry-nauru-immigration-camp-unsafe-150831141816137.html ) yeah , some fucking humanitarian solution that is . 
   and where possible offer jobs ( i know , that 's easier said than done in most countries ) and , you know , just help them feel like actual human beings with dignity again . 
  i do n't get why people do n't get this, 
  i meant heavily-armoured police and barbed wire fences . 
  food and water do n't mean shit if in the other hand 's a weapon ready to strike if you do n't give up literally every last shred of your autonomy . 
   if any of them are even from syria . 
  it 's pretty fucking well-documented that a large number are . 
  as i mentioned in another reply : they 're being rounded up and treated like cattle in hungary at the moment - that is not safety . 
  and the turkish government is cracking down on kurds at the moment , too , while the rest of the middle east is still volatile . 
  none of these places is properly safe , particularly for kurds . 
   capitalizing on the good willed nature of their temporary host countries ? 
  how exactly are they exploiting them if they barely leave a mark on them ? 
   these people are nation shopping , right , so you would not do everything to give your family the best opportunities ? 
  you would settle for being [ just another guy living in squalid makeshift housing in zaatari , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zaatari_refugee_camp ) throwing out all the education you had in your former life ? 
   they want return on investment , not `` safety '' . 
  a ) how about both ? 
  or , have you considered that they might have family in diaspora and want to travel to be with them ? 
  and b ) tell me with a straight face you would n't want that . 
  c ) they 're being rounded up and treated like cattle in hungary at the moment - that is not safety . 
  and the turkish government is cracking down on kurds at the moment , too , while the rest of the middle east is still volatile .
