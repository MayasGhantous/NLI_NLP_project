perhaps , but are they beyond public scrutiny ? 
  i am sure that if a bunch of judges made an obviously racist or sexist judgement , reddit would be virtue signalling and tweeting to a state of hypoxia over it . 
  the argument was for national sovereignty i.e. 
  the right to self-determination . 
  parliamentary procedure is an entirely internal affair that is separate to the issue of living under condition of the judicial superiority of the eu court .

  [ yes , judges must be allowed to act in impunity and without public scrutiny . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjlurxzlua ) actually it is more important that all individuals are held to scrutiny , that is more democratic . 
  what if the judges were guilty of procedural impropriety ? 
  or what if we simply think their arguments are pure sophistry ? 
  have they not undermined the people ? 
  are they not therefore their enemies ? 
  it is a longstanding accusation that our judiciary has a liberal bias , so this could be seen as directly undermining the will of the general public . 
  the objections people have against the daily mail are largely because they do n't align with their own viewpoints . 
   london 's financial institutions dwarf everything else . 
  gross machinery and electrical product exports are worth twice as much as the financial stuff :  ** machinery / electrical products ** # ( thou ) 89,470,424  share of uk exports : 13.9 % share of world exports : 2.4 %  ** financial services ** # ( thou ) 47,580,000  share of uk exports : 7.4 %  share of world exports : 17.9 % which are also overshadowed by other exports like minerals and the like . 
  but yes , financial services dwarf everything else in terms of * net * exports , but that 's just because we sell so much of the stuff overall . 
  plenty of great stuff comes out the uk , m8 . 
  grand theft auto !, 
  one direction !,

  it 's like a fucking wonderland of brilliance , do n't worry about us , we 've got it all . 
   i would be very surprised .

  if the eu is so thoroughly convinced of the uk 's tabloid lies , which have clearly served to propel the uk towards leaving the eu , thus surely undermining the financial integrity of the project , you would have thought that they might look into proceedings against the libelous nature of such publications ... ... unless they know they 're incapable of rebutting the claims in a place where there is an actual burden of evidence placed on them . 
  i imagine the brexit negotiations will be largely like if you 're playing as britain vs france in a game of red alert 2 where both players are just constantly mashing the [ laugh taunt button ] ( https://youtu.be/fiuyedkvpbs?t=1m9s ) . 
  it was actually the entirely impartial royal institute of chartered surveyors that during the previous election described ukip 's housing policy as `` the only serious policy in this election for addressing the housing crisis '' . 
  the fact is , rics , ciob and the rtpi all know just how bound up in bureaucracy the uk 's planning system is , and that it will take too long to get house builds high enough to absorb the level of immigration under the eu . 
  of course this does n't address our swelling unfunded pension obligations and dwindling indigenous birth rate but i suppose there are scarcely few real economic winners in an aging economy and it 's about time the older generation took a hit for once . 
  well i was all for brexit originally but now we 're losing a major exporter of some of the uk 's [ most highly esteemed products ] ( https://www.fun-fancydress.co.uk/store/images/cache/97379.800.jpg ) , i 'm beginning to have second thoughts . 
   brits will still buy cars - including german cars . 
  [ actually if we abandoned our import tariffs , there really would be no incentive whatsoever to purchase any more german schei\u00dfe , danke sehr . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32332210 ) you see european protectionism has allowed german car manufacturers to become uncompetitive as the eu artificially inflates the prices of competing ( superior ) foreign products . 
  brexit is a bit like that scene in they live where the guy puts on the sunglasses and sees all of the eu 's shitty products for what they really are .

  you have n't made a salient point here at all . 
  economics , especially macroeconomics does not have an agreed upon objectively correct school of thought . 
  there are competing theories and what we have to do is assess them on their own merits . 
  the problem is that the massive consensus of economists against brexit was that they unanimously concluded short term economic uncertainty ( nobody is disputing that ) but a long term loss through maintaining trade barriers and not embracing unilateral free trade . 
  at that point , these economists become useless because it is now less about economics and more about politics . 
  the question is , do we want to take on the risk of being able to source better quality , cheaper goods from around the world , if this is potentially putting some of our industries in jeopardy through not protecting them with import tariffs ( which ultimately the consumer picks up the bill for ) ? 
  the consumer will win out , some uk businesses will lose out , but altogether due to the forces of massive technological innovation we will ultimately be better off because what the economists have not accounted for , and can not account for , is the impact that automation will have on production of goods and provision of services . 
  over time , those products that can be easily replicated and automated will be sold cheaper by other countries . 
  this is inevitable and has already happened to many of our products . 
  but consider those products that can not be automated ... 
  the uk , as the crucible for innovation and creativity in the entire world , is able to offer better products globally ( can you really swap grand theft auto for a cheaper chinese rip-off game ? 
  can you swap out a land rover or jaguar for a cheaper indian model ? 
  ) , therefore we protect our industries not on price but on exploiting the naturally low levels of price elasticity of our exports . 
  economists can not accurately reflect that in their models because there is too much complexity at stake . 
  i appreciate a romanian might not understand this argument because your nation does n't produce anything remarkable , but have a go at reading this a few times and see if it sinks in .

   every time consumer behavior changes or a new technology surfaces , all 28 eu member states use the eu to harmonize regulations so as the same product can be sold in all 28 countries . 
   so when you say that because the single market has been worked on and not finished in 50 years , that somehow shows how inefficient the eu is , it really begs the question if you have any idea , at all , about what you are talking about . 
  the wto manages to oversee trade between 164 countries and has only been in existence since 1995 . 
  so , do n't worry , i know exactly what i 'm talking about , and for the sake of clarity here , what i 'm * very specifically * talking about is the glacially cumbersome , labyrinthine , protectionist legal boondoggle clusterfuck that the european union represents , which endows us with a massive net loss in contributions , and a whopping 1 % addition to our gdp - which we will exceed by other means by leaving . 
  do n't get me wrong , it was a sterling effort by the union to do what they did . 
  it 's just they did n't do it very well . 
  you 're welcome to it , it 's shit ideas about monetary `` harmonisation '' via the highly regarded euro project ( very popular in the mediterranean states i hear ) and all of the rest of the mess of protectionist inefficiencies that it so clearly represents . 
  professor michael dougan presenting , to borrow a will selfism , a stupid person 's idea of an intelligent argument . 
  michael is a lawyer . 
  not an economist . 
  but he has pretentions above his station of being able to elucidate understanding of the latter - which he definitely does not have . 
  the entirety of his series of talks are matter of fact descriptions of the intended purpose of a single market ( `` limited harmonisation '' etc ) , followed by inferences that these are unquestionably beneficial by their mere existence or the fact that it 's taken 50 years for the eu to cobble the current arrangement together - as if the length of time it has taken is a qualifier of its efficacy !, 
  maybe if i took 50 years to smear a canvass with my own shit i could claim it was the greatest painting of all time . 
  i digress . 
  [ thanks , but i 'd rather listen to a professor of economics talking about the single market than a mere professor of law .

   banks on the continent a lovely fantasy . 
  where will the banks be , by the way ? 
  where in both cases the total population of each city centre is smaller than the number of workers in the square mile of the city of london itself ? 
  what language will they all be speaking ? 
  will they be translating all of their financial contracts between german and english ? 
   an england weaker than ever in history is good thing for the rest of europe . 
  not that it will be weaker than ever , but if it was then it would not advantage anybody on the continent to see one of their best customers purchasing less of their wares , neither would it be especially useful to have the country with the world 's third largest military expenditure in a position where they are less willing to provide support where required . 
  all of the anti-british sentiment is pure sour grapes .
