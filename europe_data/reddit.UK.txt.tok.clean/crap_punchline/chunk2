  the reason why the united kingdom is in a position to leave the european union is due to its strength and lack of will to become a vassal of a group of social marxists who seem resolutely determined to , as enoch put it , become busily engaged in heaping up their own funeral pyre . 
  the eu lead to the loss of 500 ford jobs in england thanks to a loan of theirs moving those jobs to turkey . 
   the committee , at paragraph 17 , also generously adopted the view of this blog that it is not so much that the uk government does not have a plan for brexit -- it does not even know what is to go into a plan .

  ## lol / r/europe btfo ## btfo ## btfo, 
  saint agur for me , please . 
  the euro . 
  the euro can not protect member states from asymmetric economic shocks . 
  if one country benefits from the drop in the price of say , oil , and another country suffers as a result of its exports , then you have an asymmetry - but in order to resolve that , you 'd need to control your own money supply to create monetary stimulus . 
  this is why greece , spain , italy et al are all fucked . 
  the eu is supremely arrogant , in fact economically illiterate to the point where they will ride this whole project into the ground because they are too proud to admit that they can not be like the usa . 
  the usa succeeds as a federal state because despite its disparate economic zones , they speak one language and historically are more mobile . 
  in essence , the people are more fungible . 
  people in europe are just not the same . 
  the ultimate ambition of the eu is to dissolve borders in order to be symmetrical to the us . 
  the extent to which this would work is highly questionable and would ultimately lead to the destruction of member states cultural distinctiveness as people become so mixed that there would be no france or spain , only europa . 
  and of course it would be necessary to shore up their economy with a nice influx of young cheap labour from say turkey or even russia to make this work in the long term . 
  and there you have it why the whole thing is a total fucking shitshambles and why it was totally necessary for britain to leave . 
  now this is a broalition i could get used to . 
  as a reminder : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lekeut1tilu ... and the cardiff professor of applied macroeconomics does n't give two fucks . 
  but then again , he 's a professor of economics who has actually informed the very policies that saved the uk from the brink of economic disaster in the 1980s . 
  `` economic disaster '' is an idea that the eurozone is going to have to get comfortable with quite quickly , enjoy the fireworks over the next few years . 
  an irrelevant strawman argument . 
  i 'm not arguing for nigel in this case . 
  i 'm saying that the eu defends this democratic process . 
  from the perspective of the eu , their democratic process is pure and perfect a representation of national interests as the ec says , yet holds are nige out to be a vexatious pariah . 
  but he certainly does n't represent the whole of gb . 
  far from it . 
  barely half of it - if that . 
  anyway i see i 've been predictably downvoted to oblivion , surprised my comment managed to float this far down considering this place is saltier than the dead sea . 
  enjoy your new friends from north africa and the middle east anyway . 
  by this chap 's logic , then , you 're all agreed that nigel farage was a fair and proportionate representation of british interests in the european union . 
  check m8, 
  yeah but is n't there this thing called manners where if you move to a country , you should try to actually assimilate the customs of your host ? 
  it 's sort of one of the reasons why this whole brexit thing happened . 
   poor but boring fixed that for you . 
   much . 
  do n't do this . 
   ability to learn from lessons and move forward so given the abject failure of the euro to allow the financial flexibility for greece , ireland , finland and spain to deal with the great recession , and the european union 's adamance that it can fight it 's way through without changing how it handles the eurozone project , how exactly do you back up that audacious claim ? 
  if anything you have touched upon the [ * biggest fucking flaw * ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/06/19/paul-krugman-is-entirely-right-about-the-disaster-that-is-the-euro-here/#15684cc13e27 ) of the eu . 
  at least choose something i could half believe , like securing better worker 's rights , or making sure my sushi is frozen before a restaurant serves it to me . 
  christ , it 's like the remainers stick their finger in the air and just hope they 're right on whatever shit they 're spouting . 
  just google the imf 's most recent report on the eurozone . 
  go on , just do it . 
  and you want us to stay in the european union while that shit pile comes crashing down . 
  the sterling does not insulate us from that . 
  and the eu 's chronic , bewildering inflexibility on these issues could spell a total fucking disaster for us if they steered their titanic towards another economic iceberg . 
  ah so you 've chosen to indulge in a logical fallacy instead of confronting your ego . 
  fair enough , pretty much everybody else does that . 
  but we were not talking about * living standards * . 
  your main point is that ** growth ** requires ** single markets ** , and yet here we are staring down the barrel of yet another year of poor growth in the eu , while the rest of the world , in all of its various forms of non-trade bloc membership , steams right ahead . 
  it is completely dishonest that you insisted that membership is economically a necessity when the evidence demonstrates absolutely conclusively that you are full of shit , just like every other remainer and member of this hugbox of a board where everybody is so quick to insist that the leave campaign cites no statistics , no evidence and has no economic argument when it 's right here , staring you in the face . 
   where we require single markets for growth [ lol ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kmixziz.png ), 
  it 's frankly wonderful . 
  now export the greasy brits from lagos et al. 
  and it 'd be perfect . 
   eu citizens generally have the right to live and work in any other eu country . 
  that means we ca n't control the scale of immigration from other eu countries . 
  but unlike eu countries which have signed up to the schengen agreement , we do still have border controls . 
   eu citizens can be refused entry for reasons like public policy , public security and public health , and the uk retains passport checks to allow this to happen . 
   eu law says that `` previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds '' for keeping someone out . 
  the person 's behaviour must be a `` genuine , present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society '' . 
  about 1,800 eu nationals were refused entry to the uk on arrival and left the country in 2015 . 
   https://fullfact.org/europe/immigration-and-eu-referendum/ tl ; dr the uk is not in the schengen area but there are some very limited circumstances that allow the uk to police who enters the country . 
  of course even if we left there 'd be nothing to stop the uk from still bringing aboard immigrants , but at least now they would have no excuse for the unmitigated increase in immigrants and the government could be held to account for their socially destructive policies . 
  the baby boomers will simply have to go back to work . 
  why the fuck should they need a 20 year holiday ? 
  and what great tech companies can be found in europe ? 
  where 's europe 's google , microsoft , twitter , ibm , apple , ebay , amazon , facebook ? 
  why is it that europe has been so thoroughly shite at coming up with any tech power house ? 
  getting out of the eu would allow britain to attract tech talent from all over the world , not the tech illiterate eu . 
  the uk is better off out of the eu if it wants to pursue tech . 
  france ca n't do shit . 
   what do europeans actually need ? 
   a democratic system where they have control over what happens , and where multinationals do n't abuse them . 
  so the solution to this is an undemocratic federacy staffed at the highest levels by ex-goldman sachs employees . 
  i get it . 
  why do we need to form a trade bloc to `` compete with the us or china on eye level '' ? 
  why does n't japan need to do that ? 
  brazil ? 
  [ look at how the european union has excelled at growing economically ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2014/11/articles/main/20151101_ncc001_595.png ) it is absolutely , eminently and undeniably clear that the eu is uncompetitive and entirely fails at the sole objective you claim is so essential for its constituent nations to achieve . 
  it 's like the most extremely homogenised liberal love-in imaginable . 
  any dissent against their ideas is met with total suppression . 
  needless to say that i 'm banned there , although i will concede that was because i was being more of a cunt than usual , so i ca n't say they were wrong to do it . 
  it may be hyperbole but it ai n't no irony , m8y . 
  well you see , i 've tried to weigh out my well thought-out comments before . 
  my post history is lavishly furnished with the most erudite , graceful and articulate arguments to ever grace this smoking turd trench of a subreddit . 
  but you see , most of these posts are ignored not for their lack of poise but because the denizens of / r/europe can not be bothered to actually intellectually engage with the issues at hand , but would rather repeat a few choice slogans , erect a few strawmen and call it a day with a barrage of unthinking upvotes for those that parrot it all , and outright censorship for those who dare challenge it . 
  how liberal and tolerant of the europeans . 
  instead i can now only offer something that is perhaps on a level with the / r/europe debate ; mindless chanting , sloganeering and retarded all-caps shitposts until i get banned . 
  yessss come onnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn no more british tit for the eu to suck on tit denied, 
  delicious sour grapes watch as we prosper the sun never sets on the british empire, 
  czechs who escaped german hegemony to fight for an independent country that afforded them liberty , you mean ? 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  is / r/europe still trying to reframe the arguments against the eu as arguments against europeans ? 
  is this the same / r/europe that says brexiters are racist and xenophobic while voting to the top of the subreddit how yet another tolerant and liberal eu member state has banned traditional muslim clothing ? 
  it 's glorious watching you all trip over yourselves to try and sling a rock at the glorious leave campaign , please , do furnish me with more of your supremely entertaining ineptitude . 
  i was being disingenuous to make a point . 
  i do n't think brexit is the more egalitarian option . 
  it 's profoundly selfish .
