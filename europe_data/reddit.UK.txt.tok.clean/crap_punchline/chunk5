  i did read the whole thing . 
  and as for whether it would change my mind , that is rather more dependent on if you made a coherent point . 
   pretty soon , nobody drives fucking safe cars anymore . 
  thats what the eu protects against it 's almost as if you decided to totally ignore the * evidence * i presented to you and preferred to offer an entirely fictional account of how the eu * could * have protected its citizens against faulty cars , despite having propagated some of the worst cars on the market . 
  the eu is not necessary for this but this is not the point of my original post . 
  many parts of the world have their ncaps ( and funnily enough the uk actually created the encap ) and the eu is not special in this way . 
  the problem is that the eu , despite the * theory * of being able to regulate quality has * failed * to do this - evidently !, 
  i do not have to pick my way through eu regulations to come to this conclusion because the conclusion is in the effect . 
  what i am saying is that , despite the eu 's intentions it does not succeed at ensuring the quality of its most important products , ergo , it 's a load of shit . 
  [ `` product standards '' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32332210 ) lol . 
  everybody in the uk has been talking about how much they hate the eu for about , oooh , a decade . 
  everybody that turned out to vote remain did n't even give it a thought until the week before , if at all . 
  it 's pretty simple mathematically ; given the demographic make-up of the result , most of them were still actual children while the key formative eu policies were setting the groundwork for swelling support for brexit . 
  only the terminally naive never saw this coming . 
  ask any syrian . 
  yes , here you go : [ good bye to this ] ( https://fullfact.org/media/uploads/uk%20payments%20to%20eu%20budget%20since%201973.png ) [ good bye to this ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/78401000/gif/_78401619_eu_uk_migration_624gr.gif ) [ good bye to this ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/28/europe/germany-merkel-security-refugee-policy/index.html ) [ good bye to this ] ( http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2063553/the-pound-doomed-uk-join-euro-declares-germany-cameron-returns-crisis-talks-handed.html ) good bye to all of that shit . 
  everybody 's crying because we 're saying no to a protection racket . 
  yeah it 'll hurt but this country now has a semblance of dignity . 
  also if you 're wondering about the economic effects of brexit , check out the revised figures as published in a study by cambridge university and reported by reddit and / r/europe 's toilet paper of choice , [ the guardian ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2017/jan/08/economic-forecasts-hardwired-get-things-wrong ) . 
   the cambridge study says the loss peaks at 3 % of gdp early in the 2020s . 
  the loss of gdp per head is smaller -- never much more than 1 % -- and soon recovers . 
  no , no . 
  the * really * interesting part starts when the eu starts asking you for more contributions to shore up the unfunded pensions obligations of the now destitute mediterranean member states . 
  that will be positively hilarious to everybody who loves the eu so much . 
  [ you 'll be needing this . 
  ] ( http://img.nauticexpo.com/images_ne/photo-g/21603-3037713.jpg ), 
  could you explain why you think that a customs union that deliberately imposes high import tariffs against the rest of the world to favour its own products can not be described as xenophobic ? 
  amazing how those august eu protections panned out in ensuring the high quality of [ european products ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32332210 ) , is n't it . 
  the ultimate regulation , it would appear , is that of free market choice . 
  if it is bad , i do not have to buy it . 
  if it is good , i choose to buy it . 
  what does n't help is when a giant protectionist trade block deliberately forces up competitor 's prices to ensure people are forced to buy inferior shit to protect jobs . 
  so , in effect , we have the very opposite scenario than you describe by leaving the eu . 
   french culture , cuisine , and language will still exist . 
  if you look hard enough for it . 
  ever been to paris ? 
  i 've been there . 
  it 's a vassal of algeria . 
  michael portillo also said before the referendum when asked whether we 'd leave the eu `` if you believe that , you 'll believe anything '' . 
  `` you vont komputer ? 
  yes . 
  this is komputer . 
  enjoy these data processings . '', 
  i love you . 
  lol , just lol, 
  who the judiciary are ultimately answerable to in our legal system is irrelevant . 
  if a newspaper wants to run a headline that criticises the judiciary as being counter to the public interest , then we 're fortunate enough to have the press freedom to do that . 
  it is n't libellous and it 's entirely at the discretion of the public whether they agree with it . 
  your sources are a bit shit are n't they . 
  your first one is pretty much `` here you go , have this entire website to read '' . 
  it does n't really work like that . 
  fortunately i can rebut your entire hypothesis . 
  just read [ this ] ( www.wikipedia.org ) , the information is in there trust me . 
  then , your infographic clearly demonstrates that blacks are vastly and grossly disproportionately overrepresented in crime . 
  there 's nothing in there about muslims committing sexual assaults , though , so what point are you trying to prove with this document ? 
  chances are you do n't have a point and you lazily assume that by posting a couple of links a defence of your non-existent argument will just be conjured out of thin air . 
  not really . 
  surprise !, 
  you ca n't comment on this article on the guardian . 
   despite all the `` tear-jerking '' pictures of refugees posted all over the web the only thing that 's getting jerked over refugee pictures is my cock when i see them all face down in the sand , washed up from drowning . 
  i would like to invite you and the twelve people who upvoted your post to wear a dunce cap for not understanding how abandoning import tariffs ( yes , a fee artificially placed on top of what you would pay via the free market ) leads to cheaper foods . 
  is it just the case that any comment trashing britain , no matter how totally divorced from reality , just automatically gets upvoted because / r/europe has a fragile ego ? 
  why , yes . 
  yes it is . 
  will it really ? 
  without import tariffs we get cheaper food from elsewhere , not necessarily better food . 
  we could get shit , cheap cheese from the us , but will this compete with britain 's finest like stilton ? 
  there 's many people in the uk who even now insist on buying british farm produce , and these people will always exist . 
  instead , the imports will fill out the bottom rung of the market , which is exactly what britain needs to do at the moment considering we are having issues with people becoming reliant on food banks . 
  lowering the price of food is a much bigger issue than worrying about competing products cutting into the profits of the 1 % of people who work in uk farming . 
  now the question must arise that if the perpetrator was kurdish iraqi , do we now observe that the now regular murderous attacks against indigenous european citizenry are in fact along ethnic lines , and less related to ideology ? 
  this has important implications for crime reduction and immigration control . 
   it is impossible to have a country with 65 or lower average iq . 
  it simply could n't function . 
  funny you should say that . 
   the claim that the default state of a nation is `` low immigration '' is so historically retarded it 's ridiculous . 
  if you have to go back in time to the founding of a nation to prove a point , what 's the point in talking about it ? 
  once a nation is settled , developed and mature , its default state is low immigration . 
  it must be otherwise you would have total genetic turnover within a few decades . 
  we are currently dealing with hyperbolic levels of immigration in europe , and it is objectively correct to say that immigration from africa and the middle east are relatively high compared to say the early to mid 20th century , when you used to go to paris and it was full of ethnic french , not algerians , for example . 
  except this has n't happened , so it 's a useless hypothetical situation . 
  plus , the default state of the nation is with low immigration . 
  maintaining the default state encourages stability . 
  again , this is about unintended consequences and the unknown problems attached with mass immigration . 
  you are less likely to encounter problems if things remain as they are , you see . 
   random opinion piece yes , a totally random person and not the most recent former united nations special representative of the secretary-general for international migration thanks for not addressing any points and washing your hands of it . 
  maybe discussion forums are n't your thing as they involve articulating an actual argument . 
  you can just look at pictures . 
  what was it due to then ? 
  why specifically did anders breivik choose to carry out the attack ? 
  did he say ? 
  what did he say ? 
  see edit , your comment is pointlessly fallacious . 
   immigrants destroying europe nice strawman . 
  i think `` eroding national identity '' is sufficient in this case , and although that 's a destructive process , and that immigration from north africa and the middle east is responsible for all major terror attacks apart from that by anders breivik ( and even that is , by proxy , due to the immigration ) , we can actually object to the wholesale importation of these people without overstating our case . 
  edit : to those taking issue with the idea of breivik 's attack being due to immigration , how do you figure this is incorrect when he expressly and specifically stated that his reasoning for the attack was * because of immigration * . 
  note that before you take your predictable moral high ground , i am not sympathetic to breivik , however it is an act of intellectual cowardice to deny immigration 's role in this , as greater immigration leads to greater risk of terror attack from extreme right wing groups , and simply calling them `` racist '' does not , believe it or not , do much to prevent the attacks from happening . 
  it is painfully naive that social marxists continue to enforce immigration on people without understanding that there are negative social consequences that can not be controlled by them . 
   pretty irrelevant beyond policies on the eu anyway apart from how the royal institute of chartered surveyors described ukip 's housing policy as `` the only realistic policy to address the housing crisis '' in the 2010 general election . 
  only the biggest problem facing young people in the uk , but yeah , keep on swallowing the liberal media dogshit , hey .
