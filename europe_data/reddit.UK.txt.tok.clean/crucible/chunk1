it 's not a thing in the uk - although you do see the occasional article in the news saying kids are carrying too much stuff in their bags . 
  a lot of secondary schools now have lockers , so students can store books they do n't need , or things like their sports kit . 
  i 've noticed a lot more adverts for fibre internet when i 've visited italy in the last few years , mainly in large cities though . 
  also , italy 's high speed rail system is top notch , < 3 those italo trains . 
  yeah , they 've been rolling out in the uk as mcdonald 's update their restaurants . 
  in some of the larger cities you can also order your meal from your phone using their app too . 
  11 , if you count england and scotland as separate countries . 
  if you like techmoan , then check out [ big clive ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/bigclivedotcom ) . 
  he reviews cheap electronics , and finds some frankly dangerous shit on sale in cheap shops in the uk . 
  i 'm also enjoying [ all the stations ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc7ttkx46njxuexz0aod4q5g ) at the moment . 
  for those who do n't know , a couple are trying to visit every railway station in great britain , and they upload videos of their progress every few days , along with behind the scenes stuff and question and answer videos . 
  i feel sorry for everyone involved really - teachers constantly have to adapt to new curriculums and course specifications , changed seemingly at the whim of each new government . 
  meanwhile , no matter how good the results are each year , the british media just shits on the whole system from on high throughout . 
  kids sitting exams have to listen to politicians like michael gove , who is on the news repeatedly saying gcses are useless and too easy * during the exam season * , and results day is dominated by a procession of talking heads saying exams are too easy now , and top grades are given out like sweets . 
  a * to g grades have now been replaced , in england anyway . 
  starting this year gcse results will be graded from [ 9 down to 1 ] ( http://www.aqa.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/policy/gcse-and-a-level-changes/9-1 ) . 
  yes , most government websites will offer a welsh language option - for example [ this ] ( http://www.flintshire.gov.uk ) is what my local council does . 
  official forms like censuses , applications for driving licences etc are all available in welsh , usually in the same form . 
  every letter i have had regarding medical appointments recently has been in both languages too . 
  not nationally - welsh has official status in wales though . 
  yes , both [ cymuned ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cymuned ) and [ cymdeithas yr iaith ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welsh_language_society ) campaign on behalf of welsh-speaking communities , and for the preservation and continued use of the welsh language . 
  there is also a [ welsh language commissioner ] ( http://www.comisiynyddygymraeg.cymru/english/pages/home.aspx ) , they are a government body who can actually enforce laws like the [ welsh language measure ] ( http://law.gov.wales/culture/welsh-language/welsh-language-wales-measure-2011/?lang=en#/culture/welsh-language/welsh-language-wales-measure-2011/?tab=overview&amp;lang=en ) . 
  lol what ? 
  that 's some bizarre logic !, 
  it was introduced separately in each nation of the uk . 
  wales was first in 2011 , northern ireland followed in 2013 , scotland in 2014 , and then finally england in 2015 . 
  i 'd prefer cymru to be honest - wales and welsh come from the old english * [ wealh ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wealh ) * , which translates as `` foreigner '' ... 
  meanwhile [ cymru ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welsh_people#terminology ) and cymry are descended from the brythonic word combrogi , meaning `` fellow-countrymen '' . 
  itv and bbc agreed to share six nations coverage because sky were sniffing around the tv rights , and some of the participating nations did n't want it to go to a subscription tv service . 
  the best-selling cars in the uk regularly include hatchbacks like the [ ford fiesta ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/ford_fiesta_registered_september_2013_998cc.jpg/1024px-ford_fiesta_registered_september_2013_998cc.jpg ) , [ ford focus ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/brand_new_ford_focus_1.0_ecoboost_%282014%29_%2816063440736%29.jpg/1024px-brand_new_ford_focus_1.0_ecoboost_%282014%29_%2816063440736%29.jpg ) , [ vauxhall astra ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/vauxhall_astra_registered_december_2015_1399cc.jpg/1024px-vauxhall_astra_registered_december_2015_1399cc.jpg ) , [ vauxhall corsa ] ( https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/gallery_slide/public/vauxhal22l-corsa-uk-2014-003_0.jpg?itok=fw9b8vif ) and [ volkswagen golf ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/volkswagen_golf_1.4_tsi_-_flickr_-_alan_d_%281%29.jpg/1024px-volkswagen_golf_1.4_tsi_-_flickr_-_alan_d_%281%29.jpg ) .

  ` premium ' small cars like the [ mini ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/2009_mini_hatch_%28r56%29_cooper_hatchback_%2826610582445%29.jpg/1024px-2009_mini_hatch_%28r56%29_cooper_hatchback_%2826610582445%29.jpg ) and [ fiat 500 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/fiat_500_%282007%29_front.jpg/1024px-fiat_500_%282007%29_front.jpg ) are very popular here too . 
  a lot of people see them as something of a step up from a fiesta or corsa . 
  smaller saloon cars from premium brands , like the [ bmw 3-series ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/2012_bmw_320d_%28f30_my13%29_luxury_line_sedan_%282015-07-24%29_01.jpg/1024px-2012_bmw_320d_%28f30_my13%29_luxury_line_sedan_%282015-07-24%29_01.jpg ) , [ audi a4 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/2009_audi_a4_%288k_my10%29_2.0_tdi_sedan_%282015-07-09%29_01.jpg/1024px-2009_audi_a4_%288k_my10%29_2.0_tdi_sedan_%282015-07-09%29_01.jpg ) and [ mercedes c-class ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/2015_mercedes-benz_c_200_%28w_205%29_sedan_%282015-07-03%29_01.jpg/1024px-2015_mercedes-benz_c_200_%28w_205%29_sedan_%282015-07-03%29_01.jpg ) remain very popular too .

  true . 
  i thought i 'd point it out though because people seem unaware of the fact outside of wales . 
   because it 's not an official language at the national level welsh has been an official language in wales since 2011 , see the [ welsh language ( wales ) measure 2011 ] ( http://www.comisiynyddygymraeg.org/english/law/welshlanguagemeasure2011/pages/homewelshlanguagemeasure2011.aspx ) for details .

  i did n't realise there would be seven astute-class subs , i thought it would be four or five at most .

  the sixth , hms duncan , has been [ docked in cardiff ] ( http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/nato-summit-2014-british-french-7712712 ) for the last four days as part of the nato summit in wales . 
  hmm , it looks like i replied to you instead of gausswanker , whoops . 
  that 'll teach me to reddit at work i guess . 
  it 's the same with the eurostar too , some london - paris trains stop at lille too . 
  then of course there 's the station built at haute-picardie , which most eurostar , thalys and tgv services pass through at full speed . 
  if you build infrastructure across a region people will be unhappy if it bypasses them , look at the arguments over hs2 and the chilterns for example . 
  if you build a line from liverpool to holyhead a stop at bangor would make some sense . 
  liverpool is close enough to chester that the existing rail services can serve people in wrexham and flintshire . 
  you made some good points in your previous comment about a link through west wales but i thought your attack on north wales here was unnecessary frankly .

  guess what ? 
  the british press would have you believe the train is filled with mep 's travelling first class at the taxpayer 's expense ... 
  thanks for telling me what actually happens . 
  makes sense . 
  move the other seat from strasbourg to brussels . 
  then instead of hiring a dedicated train to travel to strasbourg , they could block book seats on the regular eurostar and thalys services between paris and brussels instead . 
  edit : strasbourg not paris ...
