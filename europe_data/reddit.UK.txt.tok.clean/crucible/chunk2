  yes . 
  mostly in the north west of wales . 
  you know it  < 3, 
  haha , go for it , it 's been doing the rounds for years in the uk anyway . 
  / u/vishbar 's [ sheep joke ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2cbnog/jokes_about_other_nations/cjdvli6 ) elsewhere in the thread was pretty funny too . 
  it 's rare that the welshman is n't the butt of a sheep joke :p, 
  yeah , we have another version , but with a scotsman and an englishman . 
  also one with an irishman and an englishman ... 
  yeah , there 's another version of it for the uk , but with a scotsman and an englishman . 
  edit : there 's also a version with an irishman and an englishman . 
  looks like the poor englishman gets to drink lots of water with cow / sheep / pig / horse shit in no matter where in the uk he travels ... 
  a welsh man walking through a field , sees a man drinking water from a pool with his hand . 
  the welsh man shouts `` paid a yfed y dwr mae ' r gwartheg yn cachi yn y dwr '' ( do n't drink the water , it 's full of cow shit . ), 
  the man shouts back `` i 'm english , speak english , i do n't understand you '' . 
  the welsh man shouts back `` use both hands , you 'll get more in . '', 
  yeah , that 's very true . 
  i work in a secondary school in the uk and there are a number of challenges . 
  on the server side there is nothing to touch things like active directory or group policy from a foss perspective . 
  lots of packages will export data to microsoft office only . 
  we have many web-based systems now for things like behaviour management and exam results analysis . 
  unfortunately if you use them in firefox or chrome they throw up an error saying they are only guaranteed to work in ie . 
  ironically the rate with which schools are adopting ipads means many companies are having to shift their apps to the web . 
  going forward if it works on an ipad there 's a good chance it will work in firefox or chrome-based browsers . 
  as much as i support foss they need to step up their game sometimes - mozilla said enterprise it was n't a priority for them in 2011 , yet firefox users have been crying out for group policy support and centralised management tools for years . 
  funnily enough google have that support for chrome . 
  i do tend to agree with the theory that if governments took the hundreds of millions of # / $ / $ that they spent on proprietary software and invested it in foss software then many of the issues we 've discussed could be solved quite easily . 
  whether that would actually work in practice has yet to be seen ... 
  now this is starting to sound like something from the thick of it :p seriously though , if they are just installing wind turbines in an attempt to be ` eco ' or whatever , without working out the figures first then this is nothing short of greenwash imo .

  i 'd have thought a large city like prague would be ideal for conferences and business meetings though .
