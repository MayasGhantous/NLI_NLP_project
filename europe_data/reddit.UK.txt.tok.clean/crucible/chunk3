  which begs the question : how old are you now ? 
  ( if you do n't mind me asking ) i agree though , going from north to south sucks whichever mode of transport you take in wales . 
  a decent rail link ( that does n't run through england ) would be nice . 
  better roads would also be good , or just decent bypasses past obvious pinch points like newtown . 
  i agree . 
  while i 'm a massive f1 and motorsports fan , most new tracks are now privately funded . 
  the case for this circuit seems quite flimsy and every week it seems to be on again / off again . 
  they 're planning a business park and training centre , but ... silverstone already has that and their business park is n't exactly booming the last i heard .

  you gave us a damn good fight and campagnaro really deserved the man of the match award . 
  his second try was great - i still ca n't believe halfpenny did n't see him coming when he threw the ball then .
