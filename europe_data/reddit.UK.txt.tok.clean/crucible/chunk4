  good news !, 
  yeah , i figured you were joking . 
  i 'm not surprised the authorities are annoyed at people , there was footage of some idiots in flooding somewhere the other day on bbc wales local news . 
  being washed down the street in a torrent of floodwater . 
  if it was a legitimate white water rafting course you would have thought twice about going down it , the water was flowing that quickly ... darwin award candidates , the lot of em ... 
  ha , that one 's news to me !, 
  i think if a similar situation happened today they would decide it on total points scored , or number of tries or something . 
  absolutely . 
  while the rnli had to put themselves in danger to rescue him , it would look pretty bad if they just refused to recuse somebody imo . 
  that said i suspect the majority view would be to leave the idiot and his camera to the mercy of the weather :p, 
  for about the last decade , most contract mobile phones in the uk have had ` default on ' web filters applied . 
  they can be turned off easily by the account holder . 
  by the same logic every mobile telephone network must have a list of every customer who has asked for the filter to be turned off . 
  no such list has ever been leaked . 
  nor can i think of any big murder cases where the press revealed that the suspect had no filter on their mobile phone . 
  yeah , we 've done pretty well in the [ six nations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/six_nations_championship ) tournament in the last decade . 
  three [ grand slams ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_slam_%28rugby_union%29 ) and we won the championship last year . 
  england are a good team but have been through a bit of a rebuilding phase with younger players . 
  with the rugby world cup being held in england in 2015 they will be looking to do well . 
  france seem to be a bit hit and miss . 
  another good team but the saying is `` you never know which french team will turn up '' . 
  it seems you either lose heavily to them or you just outplay their team totally , and there 's no pattern to it . 
  current [ world rankings ] ( http://www.irb.com/rankings/sportid=1/index.html ) have england at 4 , france at 5 and wales at 6 in the top 10 rugby teams in the world . 
  yeah , it 's a confusing situation . 
  ultimately the wru want what is best for the national team , and with the run of success they 've had in recent years you ca n't really blame them . 
  the trouble is without the regions there may be no national team ... on the other hand the regions want to keep the players in wales and get a bit more money from tv deals . 
  they 're stuck in the middle between the english / french leagues and the irish / scottish / italian ones . 
  this [ article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/24610729 ) explains it fairly well . 
  as usual , it 's all about money . 
  basically the 4 welsh regional clubs want more say in which leagues and competitions they play in , wheras the wru want them to stay in the leagues they are competing in now .

  meanwhile , the entire cardiff blues rugby team had their heads shaved for charity , in support of team captain matthew rees who is fighting cancer . 
  [ wales online ] ( http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/cardiff-blues-stars-heads-shaved-6457515 ), 
  i 'm just a computer technician so we do n't have that much interaction with the kids . 
  i 've heard similar to what you say from some teachers though . 
  there seem to be some fairly common beliefs held among some of the poorer sections of british society . 
  people who left school with little or no qualifications will tell their children things like `` do n't bother with school because it did n't get me anywhere '' . 
  in reality , you will probably find that that sort of person was actually dyslexic or something , but back in the 50s or whenever it was n't as easily diagnosed as it is today , so they were just labelled as ` thick ' instead . 
  of course nowadays there is much more support for children diagnosed with special educational needs . 
  there is also a greater recognition that not everybody learns in the same way . 
  for every person who can recite facts from memory , there is somebody who learns better by actually doing a task . 
  as for the domestic abuse , racism things , i ca n't really say . 
  the school i work in is in a predominantly white area , but i 've seen no obvious racism towards any of the black or mixed race pupils . 
  domestic abuse would not be something we would ever pick up on , that would be handled by senior teachers eg heads of year . 
  there are vague mentions of things in the staff bulletins , but it 's often wrapped up as `` difficult circumstances '' for a certain pupil . 
  teachers who need to know any more would be given further details separately . 
  of course `` difficult circumstances '' could be anythng from parents going through a messy divorce , perhaps their house burned down so they wo n't have books / correct uniform , or maybe two sides of the family have had a falling-out . 
  we generally do n't get to know that though . 
  the school i work at in england uses materials from [ show racism the red card ] ( http://www.srtrc.org/ ) in [ pshe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/personal,_social_and_health_education ) lessons . 
  it seems to be pretty successful , and shows that you do n't need to embed the latest ` hot topic ' into the `` heart of the curriculum '' . 
  ** wales ** not much this week as it was christmas hundreds of houses in north wales were left without power following high winds which brought down power lines on the 26th [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-25525514 ) heavy rain caused flooding in south wales too [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-25503405 ) an injured seagull stuck on a fourth floor balcony since chrstmas day was rescued by the fire service [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-25542347 ) protests about the owner of cardiff city fc , vincent tan [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-25518726 ) the welsh rugby regions look set to split from the welsh rugby union [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/25541783 ), 
  yeah , i think it 's a good compromise . 
  on my local trains there 's only one camera at the end of each carriage anyway . 
  it 's positioned so that it has a view down the entire carriage . 
  honestly unless you looked for it you would n't know that it was there . 
  i agree with / u/ggow - trains are generally considered to be a public space , with little expectation of privacy . 
  i ca n't speak for every system , but i did hear how the cctv on my local trains works a few years ago . 
  basically all the recorded footage is wiped at the end of the day . 
  if anything is brought to the guard 's attention , he can press a button in the cab which puts some kind of marker on the footage . 
  when people go to wipe the footage at the end of the day , the marker shows up so they know to archive it . 
  most cctv systems in the uk are like that - they just go on recording and overwriting old footage until something happens and video needs to be saved . 
  i 'd say that while the hdpa is right to be concerned at the proliferation of cctv , this does n't sound like anything too out of the ordinary really . 
  agreed . 
  i 've been delayed myself on trains due to cable theft , it sucks . 
  last time it happened the guard came on the intercom , apologised for the delay and then went oin a 5-minute rant about `` hooligans and vandalism '' , it was epic . 
  good idea !, 
  going by the rest of the news i posted , we could do with a bit of their luck in wales at the moment :p i thought they were darwin award candidates too . 
  they must have been desperate for cash to think that fucking about with 33,000 volts is a good idea . 
  i know electricians who have nearly died from being shocked by less voltage ... 
  yeah , when i saw that it was live cables at 33,000 volts i was surprised they were jailing them and not burying them . 
  i think they 're lucky to have escaped a darwin award frankly . 
  edit : there are similar muppets disrupting the transport and communications networks across the uk . 
  except the telecoms backbones are going to fibre optic cabling now so all they do is cut people 's phone and internet off for a few days . 
  meanwhile if the ones stealing railway cable are n't causing delays by taking the signalling cable , they 're almost being hit by trains in the process .
