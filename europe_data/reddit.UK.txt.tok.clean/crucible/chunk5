  * probably the biggest player in the eu . 
  major financial centre in europe . 
  * well known for luxury car brands eg mercedes , bmw , audi . 
  * the porsche 911 , one of the most iconic sports cars of the last 50 years . 
  * great autobahn network . 
  it 's not all derestricted , despite popular belief . 
  * sports , particularly football and motorsports . 
  in the uk people like to think england have a big football rivalry with germany , in reality you see the dutch as your main rivals . 
  when you consider german motorsport you 've got the likes of porsche and audi at le mans , walter rohrl in rallying and of course michael schumacher and sebastian vettel in f1 . 
  * good food and drink . 
  steak cooked on the stone , currywurst , you guys eat a lot of pork too . 
  drinks-wise you 've got lagers , wheat beers and white wine to name but a few . 
  * trains . 
  not just the ice high-speed train . 
  deutsche bahn own a lot of railway operators in the uk now . 
  siemens have also supplied a lot of trains in the uk since we privatised everything . 
  * germany is a major partner in the airbus and eurofighter programmes . 
  * defence-wise , uk forces have traditionally had bases in germany during the cold war . 
  * large , well equipped military but germany 's constitution has traditionally restricted it to a defensive role post ww ii . 
  * germany and the uk are probably more similar than we might like to admit at times . 
  * a few people have already pointed out the tgv . 
  one of my favourite things about france . 
  it makes getting around and even through the country so easy , and the trains are constantly being improved both inside and out , so it 's always a great travel experience . 
  ( can you guys bid to build hs2 for us by any chance ? ), 
  * paris is a great city . 
  good food and drink down at the latin quarter and lots of things to do . 
  you 've got all the famous stuff of course - the eiffel tower , the champs-elysees , the arc de triomphe , the louvre , the pompidou centre ( worth going just for the cool building it 's in ) , the notre dame . 
  the open top tour buses are a good way of seeing a lot of the city as well . 
  * outside paris there 's the disneyland park which is good fun . 
  * france has grt a great motorsport heritage . 
  world famous events like the le mans 24 hours , monaco grand prix , rally monte carlo . 
  really successful drivers like alain prost in f1 and sebastian loeb in rallying . 
  * some of the oldest car manufacturers in the world - bugatti , renault , citroen , peugeot . 
  renault and peugeot are very good at making small , fast cars . 
  * there 's a toll to use the autoroute network . 
  they are really smooth and well-maintained roads so the money is clearly going back into the network . 
  * good at rugby and football . 
  ( although it does feel like you never know which french rugby team is going to turn up on the day ) . 
  we rolled out chrome at the school i work at a couple of years ago , mainly because we were still stuck on windows xp at the time . 
  we upgraded to windows 7 this summer and still have chrome installed alongside ie 10 . 
  it can be managed with [ group policy templates ] ( https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/187202?hl=en ) that google supply . 
  firefox is n't even in the same league for enterprise support . 
  yes , they have an extended support release of firefox for a year , but they do n't offer any official group policy templates to manage it centrally . 
   tgv will always be remembered as a turning point in history of railways . 
  yeah , it 's an awesome rail service . 
  i got to paris gare du nord yesterday for the eurostar back to london and [ this ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2396282/train-bosses-research-reveals-real-impact-hs2-link-affect-500-000.html ) was the daily mail headline about our proposed high speed 2 line in the uk ... 
  arguably that 's what eurostar should have been developed into . 
  instead we just have cooperation between different european nations to run trains across borders ( eg thalys , tgv lyria etc ) . 
  thanks . 
  it 's interesting that the ` line to spain ' is under threat - i presume this is n't the route through the pyrenees ( via figueres ) that has just opened ? 
  have you got a link for that story please ? 
  i could n't find anything when i searched for it . 
  in the eu and the schengen area , but not the eurozone . 
  lego comes from denmark . 
  ca n't believe nobody has mentioned [ tom kristensen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tom_kristensen ) yet , he has 9 wins at the 24 hours of le mans race . 
  on that note , rip [ allan simonsen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allan_simonsen_ ( racing_driver \\ ) ) . 
  he competed in motorsport all around the world and always seemed to run well in whatever he was driving , whether it was british gt or australian v8 supercars . 
  [ david heinemeier hansson ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_heinemeier_hansson ) also competed in the last 2 le mans races , as well as being the inventor of ruby on rails . 
  well , they just launched a new [ budget tgv service ] ( http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2013/02/24/in-france-a-truly-low-cost-high-speed-rail-option/ ) . 
  they were buying a 250km/h high-speed train . 
  the `` off the shelf '' train , indeed the obvious choice would have been the alstom [ pendolino ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_pendolino ) . 
  instead they went for something bespoke , and seem to have repeatedly changed the technical specifications at every opportunity . 
  from what i 've read no two trains delivered were the exact same build `` under the hood '' . 
  they also managed to end up with one of the [ ugliest trains ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/fyra_v250_4806.jpg/1280px-fyra_v250_4806.jpg ) ever produced , imo ... 
  yeah , good fish and chips can be hard to beat . 
  if you 're lucky enough to get them freshly cooked it 's even better . 
  quite a lot of fish & chip shops have a cafe area indoors , usually they will only cook your food once you 've placed your order . 
  that said i always enjoy the thinner fries from snack bars in europe - probably because it 's different to what we have in the uk . 
  yeah , i ca n't say i 've ever seen any chippies offering chips with the skin still on . 
  still , thanks for the info , i must say i did n't know that . 
  fries are almost always thin-cut , as you would get across europe or in a mcdonald 's . 
  chips are peeled and cut by hand usually , most places outside the uk would describe what we call `` chips '' as being `` steak-cut '' potatoes instead . 
  in the uk we have [ shrove tuesday ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shrove_tuesday ) , more commonly known as ** pancake day ** of course , you can eat pancakes whenever you like , but it 's a nice tradition we have . 
   there 's nothing spoiler-y about it . 
  do you need a plug-in of some sort because for me it 's just a link to a `` page not found '' . 
  if you use the [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://www.redditenhancementsuite.com/ ) browser extension it will show as blacked-out spoiler text .
