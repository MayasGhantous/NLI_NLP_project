  england are hosting the tournament . 
  the welsh rugby union have agreed to allow tournament organisers to use the [ millennium stadium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millennium_stadium ) as a venue . 
  with a capacity of 74,500 it is the fourth largest sports stadium in the uk . 
  cardiff has good transport links to london and much of the south west of england so it is an ideal venue really . 
  i usually say wales is the little sticky-out part of the uk , to the left of england . 
  nowadays when i say i 'm from wales many people across western europe reply with `` ah , gareth bale ! '', 
  on some routes , express passenger trains went from being operated by steam locomotives to electric locomotives as lines were electrified in the 1960s . 
  the electrics were originally painted a [ bright blue colour ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/e3035_at_doncaster_works.jpg ) , but only had basic headlights . 
  track maintenance crews complained that the trains were now less visible so when the then state-owned british rail modernised its identity , the front of every train was painted [ bright yellow ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/86227_manchester_piccadilly.jpg ) to make them more visible . 
  more [ modern trains ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/pendolino_at_milton_keynes_central.jpg/1280px-pendolino_at_milton_keynes_central.jpg ) have three led headlights so the amount of yellow at the front is reduced to a minimum . 
  there is also a lot of 750v dc third-rail electrification on the [ merseyrail ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merseyrail ) network around liverpool and the surrounding area of north west england . 
  that font would be illegal to use on the roads in the uk . 
  since 2001 , all number plates [ have to use the font ] ( https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/rules-number-plates ) shown in the example plate in op 's submission . 
  the only exemption is for classic cars registered before 1973 , they use [ black plates ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/jaguar_xk140_convertible_classic_car._hampshire_uk.jpg ) with silver or white letters . 
  while you can still get so-called ` show plates ' made up which say pretty much anything , most suppliers only use the standard font now . 
   we spoke to the driver and vehicle licensing agency ( dvla ) and were told the reason for the two colours is so that drivers can tell which is the front or back of a vehicle simply by glancing at the numberplate , and therefore whether it is likely to be moving towards or away from them . 
  yellow was chosen because it provides the biggest colour contrast , after white , with the black lettering . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.driving.co.uk/news/car-clinic-why-numberplates-are-white-and-yellow-a-terminal-mercedes-sunroof-parking-a-911-outside-and-repairing-light-scratches/ ) also they are reflective , so a white plate at the rear of the car could dazzle the driver of a following car . 
  yes , for once we do something the same as the french :p, 
   and we have to import our rolling stock , infrastructure , and expertise from deutschland not all the rolling stock is from germany . 
  we also have [ italian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_rail_class_390 ) , [ japanese ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_rail_class_800 ) and [ american ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_rail_class_66 ) trains . 
   our rail dominance turned to shit understatement of the year . 
  back in the day we would have been selling trains to those countries instead ... 
  front plates in the uk are [ black-on-white ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/fordfocusfiesta.jpg/1280px-fordfocusfiesta.jpg ) . 
   great britain : black-on-yellow . 
  rear plate only . 
  [ front plate ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/fordfocusfiesta.jpg/1280px-fordfocusfiesta.jpg ) is black-on-white . 
   i think they recently electrified some of the cardiff-london line too . 
  it 's underway , should be completed by around 2018 or so . 
  electrification will also reach swansea now . 
  only the rear plate is black on yellow in the uk . 
  front plates are white on black , as can be seen in this picture of a [ car park ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/parked_cars_in_the_uk.jpg ) . 
  the first 4 characters of the number plate mean something too , [ where and when it was registered ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_united_kingdom,_crown_dependencies_and_overseas_territories#current_system ) . 
  in the plate shown in the link ( la51 ) , the car would have been registered in london ( l ) , at the wimbledon office ( a ) , between september 2001 and feburary 2002 ( 51 ) . 
  also the gb emblem with the eu flag is optional , within the uk you can also have specific [ national emblems ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_united_kingdom,_crown_dependencies_and_overseas_territories#national_emblems_within_great_britain ) in that space for england , scotland and wales . 
  if you have one of those on your number plates you still need to have the traditonal [ gb symbol ] ( http://shop.theaa.com/store/view-all-1/aa-magnetic-gb-plate ) displayed on the rear of the car if you visit europe . 
  i 've visited antwerp and ghent , and enjoyed both of them , yeah . 
  really ? 
  is it more of a business/politics city or something ? 
  that 's good to know , brussels would make a nice change from paris for a weekend break . 
  somebody used to do a round up for scotland , so i thought why not do one for wales ? 
  i only post one every few weeks now as it is . 
  uk-only ones tended to be england-centric anyway , imo ... 
  i should have checked the article before linking , yeah . 
  i agree it would not make much sense to bypass brussels . 
  good point . 
  hopefully eurostar can compete with thalys on the amsterdam - brussels route .

  thalys pbka trains used between paris , brussels , amsterdam and cologne are even more complex :  pbka train :  supply voltages ( 25kv 50hz ac , 1.5 kv dc , 3kv dc and 15kv 16.7 hz ac )  7 signalling systems ( tvm , kvb , atb , tbl , tbl2 , indusi , lzb ) ertms is planned to be installed around ashford international station to allow the [ new eurostar trains ] ( http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-11/13/eurostar-e320-trains ) to call there , although i think the aws / tpws systems will be retained for their older train fleet .

   i like the bit where apparently the premier league can sue for copyright infringement because they hold copyright to things like title sequences or graphics . 
  i wonder if they 'll ever go for that or if a judge wo n't consider it a bit obnoxious i suppose it would end up being like the trademark laws , if you 're ripping off the graphics to mock or defame the company they may well have a case . 
   ecclestone is happy for now because he 's got sky to pay them bucketloads and is given an exclusive tv channel . 
  the bubble will burst soon . 
  he is moving f1 to pay tv services in many countries and the casual viewers are giving up on the sport . 
  football does n't have that sort of problem . 
  i only hope fom have a viable plan for online services or even tv deals post-bernie ...  on the other side there is the argument that any competitor to sky should be able to show all or nothing . 
  it makes no sense for the consumer to have to pay loads to sky and a bit more to someone else ( bt ) for the few matches that sky are not allowed to have , whereas before they paid less overall to sky for everything . 
  it 's not good financial sense for the companies , either - look at setanta ( bust ) and espn ( sold to bt ) it would make sense for both sky and bt to show the same matches , then the viewer can vote with their wallet or take what they get with their broadband provider . 
  again we 're back to the problem with those running the pl thinking this strategy somehow benefits the customer . 
  bt can only compete because they are already bringing in funding from broadband and telephone subscribers , if they were a pure tv broadcaster instead , they would soon go the way of setanta i feel . 
   it is a clearly unsuitable model for streaming services .
