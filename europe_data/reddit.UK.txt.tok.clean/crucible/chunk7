  licensing to whole regions is an obsolete carryover from analog terrestrial tv age when access to the service within the transmitter 's range was uncontrollable and unmonitorable on per-user basis . 
  i do n't disagree with you . 
  unfortunately the people running things like f1 and the premier league are stuck in the old way of doing things on a country by country basis . 
  i would happily subscribe to things like f1 or six nations on a ` netflix ' style service , as long as each nation still gets local commentary . 
  i also agree with the people in this thread who worry about services like the bbc 's iplayer , i do n't want to see that sort of thing scrapped or restricted just to appease some eu commissoners . 
  one pub landlady did [ win a claim ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17150054 ) against sky and the pl when they sued her for using a foreign satellite service to show football . 
  nothing appears to have come of it since , however . 
  the pan-european streaming proposal being discussed in this thread is probably bernie ecclestone 's worst nightmare , he 's still stuck in the era of big money tv deals , and does n't see any value or even need for f1 to embrace the digital and online world . 
   was there a live tv coverage of this exciting chase ? 
  sadly not . 
  i will have a look thanks . 
  was that on sunday politics or something ? 
   potentially looking at the likes of sky and sports rights so they 're targeting the wrong area by going after the networks . 
  instead they need to look at the likes of uefa , fom , premier league who prefer to award broadcast rights on a per-country basis . 
  i was just thinking that . 
  the whole proposal seems completely incompatible with the way things like f1 , the premier league and the six nations are all broadcast across the eu , with different rights deals in each country . 
  the bbc do not produce much welsh-language programming for their own television channels . 
  [ s4c ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s4c ) , the welsh-language television channel , is something of an anomaly . 
  it 's [ funded ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/30/s4c-bbc-trust-change-annual-funding ) by the bbc licence fee and has recently been added to iplayer . 
  it 's actually the welsh equivalent of [ channel 4 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_4 ) , although bbc wales produce programmes for s4c like the evening news and the long-running soap opera * pobl y cwm * . 
  s4c can be received nationally in the uk on the sky and freesat satellite television services . 
  transmission on the terrestrial service freeview is restricted to wales only . 
  since the advent of digital tv we can receive channel 4 in wales , on the older analogue tv it was s4c only .

  surely the poorest regions on the list are at the top , so west wales and cornwall ? 
  did n't go in , but it looked smaller than the warrington one . 
  i enjoyed the transport museum in coventry . 
  only place i 've seen so far with a city centre branch of ikea , too . 
  damn , where will i buy a giant stuffed minion doll now ? 
  seriously though , the likes of spoons , nando 's , mcdonald 's will all easily be able to relocate i guess . 
  presumably the little shopping centre with the wetherspoons and nando 's before the library will remain where it is ? 
  i have n't visited the finished grand central yet , last time i was in the city half of new street had been rebuilt , it was a lot better than it was previously so i 'm looking forward to seeing the final result . 
   but yes , there are some really nice parts of birmingham . 
  it 's like any major city , really , there 's a lot of really nice new and traditional architecture , and there 's a lot of really shit new and traditional architecture , and it 's really all rather mixed up together . 
  yeah , you 've got the older buildings in the city centre near the museum and town hall and then the brutalist central library . 
  like anywhere you can pick and choose pictures to make it look great or a total shithole , but i do think birmingham gets a bad reputation from a lot of people in the uk , usually quite unfairly imo .

  haha , i like that one !, 
  yeah , the joke would probably work either way round to be fair . 
  it 's the same in bristol and much of south wales too . 
  we have a similar joke in wales : a welshman walking through a field sees a man drinking water from a pool with his hand . 
  the welshman shouts `` paid a yfed y dwr mea ' r gwartheg yn cachi yn y dwr '' ( do n't drink the water , it 's full of cow shit ) . 
  the englishman shouts back ; `` i 'm english i dont understand you ... '' the welshman shouts back `` use both hands , you `` ll get more in ! '', 
  a welshman , scot and englishman are walking when they come across a lantern and a genie pops out and grants them one wish each . 
  the scot says : `` i am a sheep herder , like my dad before me . 
  i want my country to be full of lovely sheep farms . '' whoosh , and so it was . 
  the englishman was amazed and says : `` i want a wall around england to keep those damned scots and welsh out . '' bang , there was a wall around england . 
  the welshman says : `` tell me more about this wall . '' the genie says : `` it 's 200 feet high , 100 feet thick , it goes all around england , and nothing can get in or out . '' the welshman says : `` fill it with water . '' = = = = a welsh man walking through a field sees a man drinking water from a pool with his hand . 
  the welsh man shouts `` paid a yfed y dwr mea ' r gwartheg yn cachi yn y dwr '' ( dont drink the water , it 's full of cow shit ) . 
  the englishman shouts back ; `` i 'm english i dont understand you ... '' the welsh man shouts back `` use both hands you `` ll get more in ! '',
