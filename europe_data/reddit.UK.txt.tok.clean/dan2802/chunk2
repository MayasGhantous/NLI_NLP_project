  name off a couple of the best selling and critically acclaimed games that sold on that platform . 
  if you did , you 'd probably say things along the like of * banjo-kazooie , conker 's bad fur day , goldeneye 64 and donkey kong country * . 
  guess which ones rare made ? 
  fucking all of them . 
  admittedly they made a lot of shitter games , but these guys are the definitive british game developer . 
  they made good , fun games which still hold up today for the most part . 
  they also made battletoads , fuck you . 
  #bullfrog productions ^ ^ guildford , ^ ^ england bullfrog games were a huge simulation and strategy title creator back in the 90 's and early 00 's . 
  responsible for the likes of theme park , theme park world , dungeon keeper , theme hospital and more , they are renowned for their games , most of which still have a cult following today . 
  #free radical design ( now crytek uk ) ^ ^ nottingham , ^ ^ england prior to being absorbed by crytek , these guys created the timesplitters series , which if you have n't played i seriously recommend it , and a rather well received stealth game called second sight . 
  after being absorbed by crytek , they created the multiplayer for crysis 2 and worked with the german crytek subsidiary on crysis 3 . 
  #team 17 ^ ^ wakefield , ^ ^ england they made worms , they still make worms . 
  nothing else needs to be said . 
  #dma design ^ ^ edinburgh , ^ ^ scotland before gta , these glorious bastards made the lemmings series , as well as a whole host of other , less successful games . 
  #the creative assembly ^ ^ horsham , ^ ^ england these guys made total war , and what was quite possible one of the most unnerving stealth games i 've ever played , alien : isolation . 
  #facepunch studios ^ ^ walsall , ^ ^ england literally five minutes down the road from me . 
  garry newman created gmod before creating facepunch , which has new created rust and is working on another title . 
  #firefly studious ^ ^ london , ^ ^ england these guys made stronghold . 
  #lionhead studios ^ ^ guildford , ^ ^ england these guys made the fable series , black and white ( plus it 's sequel ) and a weird simulation title called the movies , which is a fairly interesting play . 
  #rocksteady studios ^ ^ london , ^ ^ england these guys made the entire batman trilogy ( asylum , city and knight ) , as well as a weird police-esque game back in 2006 . 
  #criterion games ^ ^ guildford , ^ ^ england these guys made burnout and some need for speed sequels . 
  #sports interactive ^ ^ london , ^ ^ england football manager . 
  ` nuff said . 
  #media molecule ^ ^ guildford , ^ ^ england littlebigplanet . 
  ----- this just shows that you literally know fuck all about video games . 
  a quick google search could prove you wrong , and stop you looking like such a complete retard . 
  i 've only listed a handful of the bigger studios , there 's also the x-com series , and other amazing games that have come from the u.k. . 
  please do n't talk about subjects you know little about , it only makes you look incredibly stupid . 
  / r/paradoxplaza linkage right there . 
  i probably still would . 
  yeah , nothing says ` i 'm a hard cunt ' like decking a fourteen year old . 
  true enough !, 
  i ca n't really make fun , being from the west midlands i probably speak more unintelligibly than you . 
  less james bond , more dapper laughs . 
  my dota2 experience coming in handy . 
  you bloody welsh , always blaming the english . 
  yeah , nobody has their own name followed by numbers . 
  that 'd be , like , stupid and shit . 
  sandi toksvig is quite popular here , she 's danish iirc . 
  probably china , since a lot of american money is there and most of the manufacturing for a lot of your fortune 500 companies . 
  about the whole ... [ getting independence thing . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_ireland ), 
  if you 're going that route , hitler was austrian . 
  your argument literally makes no sense . 
  as opposed to the good ol' russian method of starving the fuckers to death through years of badly organised collectivism ? 
  indeed . 
  i remember walking around de wallen in amsterdam screaming football chants with three mates after villa advanced to the fa cup semi-final . 
  also , slurring broken afrikaans to a dutch shop-keeper to try and sound somewhat lucid . 
  christ that was a fun weekend . 
  he 's fucking wider than he is tall . 
  how does that even happen ? 
  we have off-licenses in the uk too . 
  it 's not exactly a foreign concept . 
  who created the oceans then ? 
   working class - labour ca n't keep a straight face here mate . 
  last time i was in brum the chicken pasta from gregg 's only had the best part of four pieces of actual chicken in it . 
  as far as i 'm concerned it might as well be islamabad . 
  but you must n't call him black . 
  wow . 
  he looks like he could kill me with a single finger . 
  i am outraged !, 
  not on my fucking nelly . 
  not entirely true . 
   if you 're going to be pedantic get it right . 
  that 's absolutely hilarious when the words are basically completely interchangeable . 
  [ british ] ( https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/british?q=british ) , and [ briton ] ( https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/briton?q=briton ) . 
   did i say i was n't ? 
  if scotland was independent you 'd still be geographically british , no if 's and 's or but 's about it . 
  your passport , strangely enough , is n't the authority on the issue . 
  you 're british by virtue of being scottish . 
  unless sturgeon has a crazy idea to dig the border down and kick scotland away into the atlantic , scotland is always going to be on britain . 
  same as wales . 
  source ? 
  mate , i speak afrikaans . 
  i can communicate almost fluently with dutch people as long as i avoid slang , etc. 
  and both of the times i have been to the netherlands the conversations i 've had with shopkeepers have mainly worked out like this - `` hallo , kan jy my help asseblief ? '', 
  yes , how can i help ? '', 
  people on the street , in restaurants etc are more than happy to speak dutch / afrikaans but what 's the point of trying in stores if i 'm just going to revert to english anyway ? 
  eh , i prefer saying i 'm two metres tall than saying i 'm six-foot-seven . 
  sounds better . 
  england + wales : laid out in [ \u00a7 58 children act 2004 ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/31/section/58 ) , only reasonable punishment is allowable under law - though it 's strange that reasonable punishment is n't ( as far as i can tell ) quantified in the act itself . 
  on a more social level , the area i live in ( wolverhampton , west mids ) , smacking is n't seen as a ` bad ' thing . 
  of course , blatant child abuse is going to be dealt with , but a smack to the hand or the back of the legs is n't going to turn a lot of heads , though it 's growing increasingly less commonplace . 
  we can be very friendly up north . 
  too friendly , even . 
  walsall ( uk ) , wolverhampton ( uk ) , franschhoek , south africa . 
  they should be tarred and feathered , so say / r/europe, 
  i 'm just glad we exist to fuel drama . 
   we do n't like waving national flags and singing our anthem . 
  woah , i 've seen the dutch during the world cup . 
  so much oranje . 
   most interesting would be the uk , because of their colonial history even though we 'd rather forget a lot of it . 
  to be fair , this could be north wales . 
  yeah , used to see a lot of apc 's and shit around telford . 
  someone ban this sick filth . 
  welcome to europe . 
  as well as israel and morocco . 
  at least you guys have an underground system or two . 
  i think birmingham is the largest city in europe without some form of underground transport and it shows , absolutely horrible to get anywhere during rush hour . 
  i do not have an issue with muslim people as a whole , coming from a city with a 40 % roundabout population of muslims i 'd say i 'm rather fond of a lot of muslims i know generally .
