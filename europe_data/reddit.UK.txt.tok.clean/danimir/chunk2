  ukraine saying crimea belongs to it is like if we said ireland or scxotland is oart of england . 
  its fucking stupid . 
  i do n't know why i have to keep linking this but here goes . 
  [ in february 2015 , a poll by german polling firm gfk revealed that attitudes have not changed . 
  when asked `` do you endorse russia 's annexation of crimea ? '' , a total of 82 % of the respondents answered `` yes , definitely , '' and another 11 % answered `` yes , for the most part . '' only 2 % said they did n't know , and another 2 % said no . 
  three percent did not specify their position ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/#702bbcd75951 ), 
  because decentralisation is more efficient . 
  multiple currencies allows different regions to adjust dynamically . 
  with computing and the internet its so easy to calculate prices and trade currency that the benefits of a single currency are obsolete . 
  both should be happy if the euro is removed then . 
  actually the undervalued euro is a pretty big factor in britain 's deficit and germany 's surplus . 
  under a third of germany 's current account surplus was with the eurozone in the first half of 2013 , compared with over three-fifths prior to the financial crisis . 
  but this shift is largely due to falling german exports to the depressed periphery , rather than rising exports from the periphery to germany . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2013/bulletin_93_js_st_article2-8164.pdf ) also for non-eurozone , britain has a # 100 billion deficit to the eu , about # 40 billion of that is to germany . 
   the german tendency to lecture the rest of europe and to explain that everything would be fine if everyone copied germany is logically absurd . 
  if every country in the euro zone had a trade surplus of 8 % gdp , there would be nobody in the world to absorb a surplus of this type . 
  one person 's surplus is another person 's deficit . 
  a surplus is a transfer of wealth from one to another . 
  so its impossible for everyone to have a surplus . 
  in a single currency , it is inevitable that the stronger countries will have a permanent surplus over the weaker ones . 
  politicians are too stupid to realise this . 
  germany needs to increase its eu budget payments massively or other countries should leave . 
  for cars , the extra transport costs outweigh the savings in labour maybe . 
  only 25 % of the economy is trade . 
  you ca n't build a house in poland and then ship it to britain . 
  imo his behaviour is expected as an israel lobbyist . 
  her behaviour as a civil servant for the british government is completely abhorrent, 
  are you joking ? 
  its completely different . 
  in crimea everyone speaks russian , in ukraine everyone speaks ukrainian and the baltics have their own languages too . 
  70 % of crimea 's population are ethnically russian because so many russians migrated there post ww2 . 
  in the baltics its more like 10 % russian ? 
  so its completely different .

  when asked `` do you endorse russia 's annexation of crimea ? '' , a total of 82 % of the respondents answered `` yes , definitely , '' and another 11 % answered `` yes , for the most part . '' only 2 % said they did n't know , and another 2 % said no .

  the worst thing is that there were 400 000 searches for theresa may and 100 000 for boris johnson last year . 
   the average quality of life and income has risen in every country that has joined the eu . 
  this is blatantly not true . 
  non-eu european countries have experienced the same growth as the recently joined . 
  joining the euro is actually really bad as you give away ability to use monetary policy and your currency is tied to western europe which causes it to be overvalued and your industry ca n't compete . 
  also joining the eu means you have no way of stopping foreign companies taking over your entire financial services sector and other important sectors - this effect drains the proceeds of production out of your country . 
  also you are guaranteed a trade deficit to western europe which will never balance as your currency is not floating . 
  now maybe eu funding could offset all this but it does n't , why did n't the eu beat russia 's offer of assistance ? 
  the consequence was that the unconstitutional coup in west ukraine which went against ukraine 's interests ( having to sign a worse deal for eu help ) angered the populations of east ukraine . 
  do you have no sympathy for them ? 
  the violence was instigated by west ukraine . 
  european companies operating the trains pay wages to europeans and pay tax in europe . 
  since we know article 50 will be triggered in at most 3 months , there 's no reason to believe anything will change after its triggered . 
  i think this is important :  in february 2015 , a poll by german polling firm gfk revealed that attitudes have not changed . 
  when asked `` do you endorse russia 's annexation of crimea ? '' , a total of 82 % of the respondents answered `` yes , definitely , '' and another 11 % answered `` yes , for the most part . '' only 2 % said they did n't know , and another 2 % said no .

  or maybe the population of a peninsula voting for their independence is ok . 
  its more like germany sucking europe dry than the other way round . 
  agreed . 
  in britain the vast majority of asians are indian or pakistani cause commonwealth and its hard to tell the difference . 
  in britain we call asians asians . 
  how is that apologism ? 
  its to describe people 's appearance , most people are white , black or asian . 
  also where in the article or the video is the word asian used ? 
  there 's 4 names , 2 are asian , 2 are n't . 
  and we will work again with north america when the us and canada are given back to us . 
  the refugee crisis started early 2015 , russia 's bombing started late 2015 and has massively helped the syrian government restore safety to allmost all of syria 's main cities so refugees can return now . 
  a large number of syrian refugees were due to eu sanctions on syria . 
  russia did n't annex crimea . 
  all kurds are ethnically iranian . 
  we have a # 100bn ( 5 % ) trade deficit to the eu because we ca n't control our trade . 
  its bad for fishers too who have to share our waters and farmers . 
  the eu thinks they can get all the benefits of britain without any commitments . 
  took me 35s to realise it was n't video footage . 
  something being legal does n't make it right and something being illegal does n't make it wrong . 
  is texas a peninsula with a separate language , separate parliament , separate history and does 90 % of texas support leaving ? 
  bad example is n't it ? 
  ukraine illegally removed their president to start the whole thing off in the first place . 
  crimea was a colony of ukraine , it has its own parliament , distinct geography , distinct language and distinct history separating it from ukraine , it chose to leave . 
  end of . 
  he did the one finger salute like isis does . 
  we 're keeping our options open on how to use the 4 million hostages . 
  if brexit goes badly i think scotland will , ni wo n't . 
  they can leave if when they want to , which they currently do n't . 
  i think chechnya should have self-determination too . 
  you are right to point out the double standards of russia there . 
  crimea have wanted independence ever since the su fell . 
  ukrainian fascists refused to allow them a referendum in 91 . 
  the wish for independence certainly was not staged . 
  [ about 90 % of crimeans support annexation ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/#5dfb6d145951 ) so it is absurd to demonise russia for this . 
  govt spending is 48 % of gdp . 
  probably the highest in europe . 
  this is pretty slow considering they grew 26 % in 2015 . 
  gdp is irrelevant when looking at ireland . 
  the reichstag fire analogy was pretty good tbf . 
  we are a very tolerant country , except to ` gypsies ' . 
  : / its like looking at the wedding photo after a divorce . 
  so much hope ... all ... for nothing . 
   in 1917 , there was no polity called `` palestine '' and there were n't really people known as `` palestinians '' . 
  that is incorrect . 
  the area was known as palestine for over 1000 years . 
  this kind of thinking is partly why i prefer leaving the eu .
