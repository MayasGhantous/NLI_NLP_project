... five parsons have been detained while trying to sell radioactive uranium ... 
  the vicars are going nuclear . 
  you are , of course , quite correct . 
  i just thought the idea of building a pan-european organisation to dismantle a pan-european organisation was a little * circular * . 
  maybe just my sense of humour . 
  who said i 'm an english nationalist ? 
  just did a quick check and you are correct . 
  there 4 of england 's 83 ( ? ), 
  counties that i have never visited or travelled through on the way to somewhere else . 
  but actually it 's not big ( 130,395 km \u00b2 - about 35 % bigger than hungary ) , just difficult ( time consuming ) to move around in . 
  uk is the current label ( since 1606 ) , england the label before that ( 954 - 1606 ) , northumbria before that ( 653 - 954 ) , a gap in my knowledge ( 410 - 653 ) , brittania before that ( 43 - 410 ) and albion before that . 
  all these states contained the area i grew up in and if i was around at the time , i would feel loyalty to that state , because it is the state that contains my home area and all the people i love . 
  i could care less whether the queen/king/lord protector/emperor is german/dutch/french / saxon/dane/angle / roman/celt . 
  it 's already happened twice to us . 
  admittedly , it was in 1606 and 1801 , but i 'm sure i would have been livid had i been around .

  edit : sorry 1658 , not 1606 . 
  love the country , hate the government . 
  i 'd like to say i 'd do something about it , but you ca n't know how you 'd act in that circumstance . 
  let 's be honest , no country has been perfectly innocent in all its history . 
  any that are , have just changed their name . 
  but any country is just a collection of people and some lines on a map . 
  i believe it is the people and not the lines that imbue a person with a sense of nationalism , perhaps as a result of genes/instinct . 
  we are one species , but many tribes ( and i mean tribes , not races or religions - but now i 'm getting on to integration so i 'll shut up ) . 
  of course . 
  do you really think that * all * the people of north korea are indoctrinated ? 
  i would say that the majority are not , they are just powerless to change the status quo . 
  but i would also say that they probably have a strong feeling for their country ( nationalist ) because it is all they know and love . 
  if my home area was in north korea , i guess i would . 
  if i define nationalism as a feeling for my home area , which i do , then my family/friends would still be there , and i would want to support them . 
  i would n't care about the government , just as i do n't care for the current ( and all previous ) uk governments . 
  i do n't know , i could imagine living/working in sweden or some other eu country , but i would still have an emotional tie with my home area . 
  this may be labeled ` england ' or ` uk ' , but really what i 'm tied to is the people ( friends/family/neighbours ) in the area of the country i was brought up in . 
  if it was possible to be a mancunian ( native of manchester ) nationalist , then that 's probably what i 'd be . 
  as it is , i 'll settle for england or uk , for now .

  so really , it was a ` not drinking ' game , where the loser did n't get to drink while shopping . 
  that sounds better . 
  not really . 
  more like no british person would put up with the hassle that british people give after they 've been drinking . 
  edit : there 's almost nothing worse than being the nominated driver and watching your friends/colleagues change from sensible , educated , erudite adults to aggressive , incoherent children over the course of an evening 's drinking . 
  ( not everybody , but there 's always one . ), 
  but why have a game ? 
  surely any game must take time . 
  time that could be spent drinking . 
  i think most brits have the ability to cook a curry and many do so regularly . 
  the authentic restaurant/takeaway curry on the other hand is somewhat different . 
  it must be able to sate the palette of one who has drunk the contents of a pub for several hours and must be patiently and kindly served to an incoherent and aggressive party of racists at some ungodly hour . 
  hence the need for chefs from the subcontinent . 
  [ roobarb ] ( https://youtu.be/n6rcnpfjci8 ) - uk , 1970 's, 
  i once went to a party where a drinking game was being played . 
  when i realised that only the * loser * got to drink , i realised drinking games were stupid . 
  a slightly different perspective here where there was already a migrant ' * crisis * ' before the * refugee * crisis erupted . 
  the migrants were eu migrants and , from a critic 's perspective , have contributed to keeping pay low and unemployment high , even though employment is at its highest ever level . 
  edit : the refugees have n't really been an economic issue here , because few make it this far and almost none on their own ( people smuggling/trafficking apart ) . 
  they * have * been a humanitarian concern . 
  i can understand why somewhere like greece ( maybe portugal ? ), 
  has that attitude . 
  they benefited from german efficiency during the good times ( e.g. 
  borrowing at german rates ) , but since the financial crisis have had to face * reality and some * , with eu/imf insistence on deficit reduction/debt repayment . 
   small states did n't want to be ... out-voted by the bigger states of the time by a simple popular vote . 
  the [ european council ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_the_european_union?wprov=sfla1 ) already has this sorted with its [ qmv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voting_in_the_council_of_the_european_union?wprov=sfla1 ) where [ 562,958 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luxembourg?wprov=sfla1 ) luxembourgers get the same 1 vote as [ 81,198,000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany?wprov=sfla1 ) germans . 
   ... it was going well , and then now when there is an immigration and economic crisis , fuck the eu ... not sure if this was aimed at uk , but if so then you should acknowledge that a series of uk governments have promised the people a referendum on eu membership since before the lisbon treaty was signed . 
  it 's only happening now because the conservative party has a majority and they are deeply divided on eu membership . 
  the referendum is meant to be cameron 's palliative to the eurosceptics in his own party . 
  edit : it 's also worth stating that cameron would never have allowed the referendum if he thought that there was any possibility of a vote for the uk to leave . 
  perhaps if we all joined forces in some kind of europe-wide resistance , a sort of suprastate , we could we take on the european superstate and stop them forming a union . 
  erm ... 
  i think i was hesitant because not everybody recognises , or at least admits , that the eu is moving in that direction . 
  also , i have encountered some who look forward to the use 's arrival ( splitters !, 
  well , there 's the lisbon treaty . 
  a nicer bit of circumventing the will of the people would be hard to find . 
  well done , eu commission !, 
  a lot of people ( though probably not the majority ) in uk * really * do n't like the movement of the eu toward a use , hence the referendum . 
  it is the bureaucratic and undemocratic aspects of the eu ( e.g. 
  eu commission ) that alarm me personally . 
  i can only imagine that a use would be worse . 
  4.5 million according to [ amnesty ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/02/syrias-refugee-crisis-in-numbers/ ) , mostly ( 2.5 m ) to turkey . 
  i 'm not sure if that 2.5 million includes those that have moved on to europe . 
  amnesty does n't show israel taking in refugees . 
  i imagine that this is because the border is closed/militarised , but wondered if any refugees are able to take that route . 
  the colour matched his eyes . 
  have a look at [ this ] ( https://finds.org.uk/getinvolved/faq ) link . 
  let 's see what happens to eu after uk referendum . 
  i think that , whichever way uk votes , there will be a move to make it more difficult for nations to leave eu , due to the potential effects caused by instability . 
  the eu then carries on with its policy of ever closer union . 
  then people in some countries start to feel like they 're losing out/supporting people in other countries . 
  a popular movement then develops to leave eu in these countries , and their government responds by starting negotiation to leave . 
  but now they find it is too difficult/expensive to leave and civil unrest ensues . 
  the country in question is unable to quell unrest and calls for help from other countries and help arrives . 
  all of a sudden there are french/german tanks in 3rd country ... and so it starts . 
  just one scenario , but i 'm sure you can imagine others . 
  and of course the friendly neighbour to the east wo n't be totally idle when whatever happens , happens . 
  you 're right . 
  after all , there is no history of these countries fighting with each other . 
  cool . 
  we can break that union up too . 
  both . 
  eurozone will continue to evolve into use before breaking up , badly . 
  it will all end in tears , sad to say .
