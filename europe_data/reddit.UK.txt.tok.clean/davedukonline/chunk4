  i know i could look it up , but honestly i do n't know why it 's important . 
  is it ? 
  as far as i 'm concerned we 're all europeans and all just people . 
  did i miss something ? 
  as usual , the uk is left out of all the fun . 
  just because you 're not paranoid , it does n't mean that they 're not out to get you . 
  pot/kettle . 
  so this song ( https://youtu.be/bahsoeaamzu ) was all just a fantasy ? 
  shame . 
  i 'll just have to eat my packed lunch in the hall !, 
  well if you do n't know ... 
  it must be really good to live in * others ( specify ) * . 
  i suppose if that 's what you like , but you could replace it with any of [ these ] ( http://www.songfacts.com/search-songs-1.php?europe ) . 
  edit : actually i have this [ song ] ( https://youtu.be/jqsg6xxgxxq ) going round my head since yesterday . 
  you 're lucky by comparison . 
  you poor , poor man/woman . 
  have you tried [ electroconvulsive therapy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electroconvulsive_therapy?wprov=sfla1 ) ? 
  i 'm confused , does the map also imply that romania ( and bulgaria ) does n't like anyone else ? 
  article 50 of the lisbon treaty specifies the protocol for countries to leave the eu . 
  * ` any member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements . 
  ' * in other words , it was ` always ' a consideration that nations might want to leave . 
  the eu was heading in a direction where more countries would join , but recent problems seem to have decelerated that process . 
  i would say that the eu wants to expand its free market . 
  whether countries should join is really a question of what they stand to gain by joining . 
  edit : i read today that italy 's economy has shrunk since joining the eurozone , greece 's problems are well known and the eu is considering fines for portugal and spain because they have failed to meet their budget deficit targets . 
  meanwhile germany is enjoying a boom , partly due to the low value of the euro , in part due to greece/italy/spain / portugal , making their exports more competitive . 
  my opinion is that 2 things have gone wrong , the first is the euro joining together strong northern european economies with weaker southern european economies ( which counter-intuitively has favoured the stronger economies ) and eu expansion to much poorer countries , which while being good for those countries has naturally led to movement of people from those countries to the richer ones . 
  those richer countries ( like germany ) in the euro are able to cope due to their current boom , but apparently richer countries without a boom ( like uk ) experience discomfort . 
  you 're correct , i 've read it before . 
  pj is my literary hero . 
  i also have a secret longing for one of [ these ] ( http://hotrodbh.com/suc51.jpg ) after reading the following by pj o'rourke . 
   a pickup is basically a back porch with an engine attached . 
  both a pickup and a back porch are good places to drink beer because you can always take a leak standing up from either . 
  pickup trucks are generally a little faster downhill than back porche s , with the exception of certain california back porches during mudslide season . 
  but back porches get better gas mileage . 
  looks awful . 
  do like [ jeep wrangler ] ( http://www.jeep.com/assets/images/vehicles/2016/wrangler/vlp/modelizer-features/jeep_wrangler_tru-lok-locking-differentials.jpg ) style , though i know it 's ridiculous , especially in england where you could only drive with the roof down on one afternoon a year . 
   the most challenging bit is driving on the other side . 
  [ are you sure ? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-36045260 ), 
  i understood ( and may well be wrong ) that stalin 's purge of the red army took place in 1938 , before the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact the following year . 
  that was my reason to suggest that the pact gave stalin a chance to prepare/upgrade . 
  happy to be corrected/educated if incorrect . 
  edit : also i was n't suggesting stalin was a great man , more that the soviet people ( s ) did us all a great service in their many sacrifices . 
  i understand and agree , but whilst evil , definitely the lesser of 2 evils . 
  i do n't mean to disregard the cruel and oppressive rule by the soviet union , but i ca n't help but think that the nazis would have been much worse . 
  you guys may not like it , but it 's all true . 
  there would be a very different eu now if the allies including the soviet union had n't defeated the nazis . 
  the soviets ( all nationalities ) did pay by far the highest price for that victory , but that price bought 50 years of freedom , albeit for just western europe . 
  yes stalin was a gangster , but a damned effective one . 
  the molotov-ribbentrop pact bought nearly 2 years for stalin to prepare/upgrade the red army and without it , who knows whether ussr could have withstood the nazis . 
  they very nearly did n't anyway . 
  that 's more like it . 
  a good point , well made . 
  you just ca n't joke about anything these days . 
  thanks for that . 
  it 's good to see we share our democratic standards with such beacons of freedom as belarus . 
  i knew it , she was right all along . 
  those mafiosa islamists are so clever !, 
  wo n't get a chance to see it explode because it will already have dissolved . 
  has anyone checked the maths in question ? 
  could be a formula to unite al qaeda , isis and the mafia . 
  agreed , but what can be done to bring this about ? 
  the most representative institution in the eu is the eu parliament and it has such little power and even then it is n't truly representative due to [ the apportionment of seats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apportionment_in_the_european_parliament?wprov=sfla1 ) . 
  in the uk , things may seem worse than in most other eu countries ( where government 's may be formed from sensible voting systems ) . 
  our representation at the council of ministers for instance will usually be from a party that does not represent the majority view , just the largest minority view . 
  it can be argued ( though not by me ) that our system works well at a national scale because if the government does something the majority dislikes , the government usually gets replaced pretty quickly and legislation is repealed . 
  this is not the case when the government commits us to irrevocable international treaties and the majority view includes the rest of europe . 
  for me , before the uk can be a committed european it must first put its own house in order . 
  i do n't know enough about all other eu country electoral systems to know if other countries share this or similar problem ( s ) . 
  well if uk votes to remain , but all other countries vote to leave , then everybody in the uk will be happy . 
  wildcatting ? 
  get to southern europe quick !, 
  i think you 're all missing the point . 
  we northern europeans ( not sure what happened in finland ) are all uptight and anal and therefore shit precisely 4 minutes before taking a shower/bath at precisely the same time of day . 
  of course southern europeans , being more relaxed about these things need a bidet to cater for the wildcat shit . 
  you could compare with welsh language decline over the last 150 years . 
  [ ... back in the 1840s , around 80 percent of people living in wales were welsh speakers , many of them spoke no english at all . 
  fast forward to the recent 2011 census and that number has dropped to below 20 percent ] ( http://sabotagetimes.com/life/mind-your-language ) . 
  it may take longer than you think . 
  from the same article ... * the welsh language has declined so rapidly because the english placed a pillow over its face and smothered it . 
  it has taken around 150 years to complete , there have been occasional bouts of kicking and thrashing against , but it 's pretty much job done . 
  wow !,

  in the nineties i worked at a uk bank where i had to use up to 7 or 8 systems all with password protection . 
  the systems were linked in such a way that each password had to be changed each month and you could n't use the same password in more than 1 system in any 3-month period . 
  on the nth time that i requested a password reset for a forgotten password i was taken aside by my manager and told to keep a note of all my passwords . 
  he even showed me his own list that he kept in his top desk drawer . 
  my first introduction to top-notch it security in uk banks !, 
  continuing another current r/europe meme , putting * the grand duchy * into google ( uk ) gives suggestions 1 . 
  lithuania , 2 . 
  finland , 4 . 
  stollen , 5 . 
  works the other way too . 
  i remember seeing the american-dubbed version of the norwegian film * trollhunter * . 
  i loved the original norwegian language film watched with english subtitles , but the american voiceovers completely changed the feel of the movie - hated it . 
  interesting . 
  i was trying to think of non-british significant historical figures and the vast majority were from western european countries ( or historical equivalents ) or oddly from russia . 
  i may just be being unfair including ancient greece in western europe . 
  yes , it is a strange one but he was very influential in britain in the 19th century and left a [ legacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clifton_suspension_bridge?wprov=sfla1 ) that lasts to this day .
