they 've had at least 12 meps since 2004 , they won 24 seats in the most recent election . 
  where are you getting that figure from ? 
  was a bit surprised to see it overground though . 
  still , nice to see it 's here . 
  funny you should mention that , it 's actually where the modern ` pirate accent ' comes from . 
  see [ here ] ( http://dialectblog.com/2011/05/24/pirate-accent/ ) for more details . 
  still , there is conservative leanings here , despite what people may say . 
  maximum devolution ( aka devomax ) was and likely still is the preferred option . 
  had it been put as an option in the referendum , then it almost certainly would have been chosen . 
  however , the uk government decided not to do that , instead forcing the scottish government to pick the wording for one question only . 
  the snp ( the party in power in scotland ) decided that it would be better to go for their overall aim - namely , independence . 
  there is also precedent for the uk government to promise further powers without delivering them . 
  see [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/263m41/uk_to_promise_scots_more_powers_if_they_choose_to/chne3mr ) for further info . 
  i 'm a yes voter , and i 'm by no means a tory voter , but it should be noted that there is in fact one tory mp in scotland . 
  in 1992 they got 11 seats , lost all of them in 1997 and regained one in 2001 . 
  they do however perform significantly better in scottish parliament elections : currently they have 15 msps and are the third largest party after the snp and labour . 
  it depends on whether or not you consider the caucasus to be european . 
  it 's also on the council of europe . 
  kazakhstan - as a counterpoint - has territory in europe but it is n't on the council , it is n't even a candidate for it . 
  thank you for that !, 
  i would never have thought to use two of the internet 's biggest resources to find it out !, 
  sarcasm aside , i see it 's to do with israel being a member of the european broadcasting union . 
  but israel is the only non-european country ( aside from morocco which only [ participated once , in 1980 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morocco_in_the_eurovision_song_contest ) ) that enters the competition . 
  pretty much all of the african countries that are in the mediterranean are also member of the ebu , my question is more to do with why israel is the only one who participates . 
  does anyone know the history behind israel 's participation ? 
  i thought these stats were interesting : ** staff **  europol : 858  fbi : 35334 ** budget **  europol : $ 84.2 million  fbi : $ 8.3 billion, 
  for a long time i was n't sure what to consider myself . 
  i moved up to scotland from england when i was about 9 years old . 
  british was too generic , i was n't scottish despite growing up here , and i did n't feel particularly english since i moved when fairly young . 
  i 've recently begun to identify as scottish-british , as in my britishness is of the scottish variety , much like there are welsh or northern varieties of british culture . 
  if i 'm talking about where i come from , i extend it to english-born scottish-british . 
  or simply english if i ca n't be bothered explaining :p i am by no means a nationalist , but i have to say that it does feel nice to have some sense of identity after so many years of not fully identifying with any . 
  yes , we gathered that . 
  can you blame them for thinking you 're from the uk though ? 
  you do n't have flair , and the uk has more than 10 times as many people as ireland . 
  it 's not surprising that they immediately thought you were from the uk . 
  was n't aware of that , thanks for the response . 
  what about kosovo ? 
  that 's a major issue with regards to serbia joining , only 23 of the eu28 recognise their independence . 
  well , it 'll certainly be interesting to see what the us has to say about this . 
  yeah , i agree , its incredibly hypocritical . 
  i give a shit about trident because i think nuclear weapons are an utterly horrific piece of technology . 
  we should n't have them , we ca n't ever use them , why not put the nuclear material/money towards something socially responsible instead . 
  ` supposedly ' presumably being because they 're advocating an independent scotland remains in nato ? 
  right , every country in the world apart from four have a codified constitution . 
  they are : * israel ( which has [ basic laws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basic_laws_of_israel ) which function in its place ) . 
  * saudi arabia ( which cites the qu ` ran as the ultimate authority ) . 
  * new zealand . 
  * the uk new zealand has about 4.6 million people and is basically in the arse end of nowhere ( sorry nz people , you know it 's true ) . 
  the uk on the other hand : * formerly controlled the biggest empire in the world * has one of 5 permanent seats on the un security council * has the 8th largest economy in the world . 
  because of the power this country holds , it is outrageous that we as citizens , unlike almost every single other country in the world , do not have single codified document that allows us to hold our governments to account . 
  you have to have a legal background and knowledge of constitutional law to be able to do that . 
  we all know the 1st and 2nd amendment rights the us constitution dictates , where would you look for the equivalent in the uk constitution ? 
  what is to stop parliament making huge changes to the uk constitution , or undoing rights that already exist ? 
  it is utterly unthinkable that the us government would try to remove the bill of rights , so why can ours get away with even contemplating removing the human rights act ? 
  because our constitution has grown organically over many hundreds of years it will be difficult to do so , but i think it is about time we moved into the modern world . 
  at least then maybe ~ ~ wed ~ ~ we 'd get a codified constitution . 
  \\  writes in scots \\  has danish flair something 's rotten here lads . 
  glasgow has a reputation as a rough city . 
  for a long while it was too . 
  also , in 2007 there was an [ attempted bombing of glasgow airport ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_glasgow_international_airport_attack ) . 
  a [ legendary bystander ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_glasgow_international_airport_attack#john_smeaton ) got involved by * kicking one of the suicide bombers in the testicles * whilst said bomber was ** on fire ** . 
  well , nobody really gives a fuck who runs for office in most countries in the eu either . 
  the us is pretty much undisputedly the most powerful country in the world . 
  of course people are interested , many people worry . 
  the last republican president started two major wars , one of which is still ongoing . 
  neither is welsh . 
  and irish is the first language of ireland 's constitution , why would n't they translate it ? 
  ( do n't tell anyone , i 'm actually one of those wankers ), 
  the bloody vikings came and stole all the good looking girls and now they have the cheek to tell us the ones they did n't kidnap are ugly . 
  an outrage i tell you , an outrage !, 
  phone numbers . 
  and many of these people who could n't bear the thought of another country having the slightest say in their laws are among the first to want to intervene abroad . 
  [ what a bizarre way to show gender percentage ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/82858000/png/_82858819_party_female_male_square_scotland-02.png ) . 
  well they did manage to get the av referendum held within a year of the election . 
  yeah , i guess so . 
  i am interested in learning esperanto , but i do n't see the point in making it * the * official language for any country . 
  the un or some other international thing , yes , it would be handy , but otherwise nah . 
  the way i see it , it has two advantages : it is n't tied to one particular country , and it 's ( apparently ) been designed to be very easy to learn . 
  my mother tongue is english . 
  as it is the lingua franca , there 's much less of a motivation for me to learn other languages . 
  there 's also the unfortunate side effect upon the balance of conversations : i have an advantage/more authority of knowledge of the language over non-native speakers , and if i try learning another language they have an advantage over me . 
  with esperanto , as it 's not tied to any particular nation , nobody has an inherent advantage over others , everyone ( with the exception of a few hundred or so people ) has had to learn it at some point . 
  speak : * english * french ( * very * out of practice ) want to learn : * esperanto ( c'mon [ duolingo ] ( https://www.duolingo.com/course/eo/en/learn-esperanto-online ) ! ), 
  * portuguese * spanish ( maybe ),

  or scottish people living in england , wales or northern ireland , whilst eu nationals in scotland could . 
  this caused some understandable outage from the former group , but how else was out supposed to be done ? 
  how do you define who is scottish when scottish citizenship is n't a thing ? 
  part of it is . 
   you wo n't send a 16 years old to jail , because he had sex with his 14 year old girlfriend ( or 18 year old , because he had sex with his 17 year old girlfriend ) . 
  no , but if you were in america you might put him on the sex offenders list . 
  ireland as a whole was however . 
  you could view northern ireland as the successor state . 
  the point about her being unelected is that all of the other candidates dropped out before the final vote , leaving her unopposed and de facto elected by nobody . 
  uh , no it 's not , we literally voted against that status back in 2014 . 
  or rather , the majority of voters did . 
  i voted in favour of it , hopefully we 'll get another opportunity . 
  not if we want spain to let us in,
