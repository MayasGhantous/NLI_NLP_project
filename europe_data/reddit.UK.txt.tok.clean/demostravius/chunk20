  increased incarceration . 
  one judge was arrested for deliberately sending minors to prison . 
  you could get around that by making people work for 3 hours a day to pay off said debt . 
  thus getting some work done , saving some money , ensuring the prison population has something to do , and they would n't be broke upon leaving . 
  if they want to work more , and save the excess that is fine . 
  although that does open a whole new kettle of fish , as to wether that is slavery or not , and what happens if someone refuses . 
  we do have an intriguing history . 
  i do n't know enough about the process but if it breaks any current animal cruelty laws i agree it should be . 
  if it falls within them , there is no reason to ban it . 
  perhaps he meant [ mad jack churchill ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jack_churchill ) famous for doing actual heroic deeds . 
  it 's odd , i have heard of the war of jenkins ear , i have heard of vernon , yet never heard of blas de lezo or that victory . 
  history is incredibly fickle at times ... 
  it would be nice if everything was learnt not just bits and pieces . 
  well worth the read . 
  she is usually [ depicted ] ( http://www.lakenheath.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/110622-f-bg055-001.jpg ) with long flaming red hair , riding a chariot with blades attached to the wheels ( although the did n't actually have those ) . 
  queen of the iceni tribe , she led a rebellion against the roman invaders and was doing very well until she led a 100-200k strong army against 10k romans and managed to lose . 
  she was captured , tortured ( i think her daughter was too ) , before killing herself with poison if i remember correctly . 
  well we have a few . 
  the most notable probably being : ** king arthur ** - it 's said when britain is in need arthur will be reborn to save the country . 
  where he was in 1066 i have no idea . 
  ** admiral nelson ** - the sailing legend , destroyer of france , one of the greatest captains of all time . 
  he has a huge column topped with a statue standing guard over trafalgar square , named of course for his most famous victory . 
  ** sir francis drake ** - another sailing legend . 
  scourge of the spanish , and known as el draque ( the dragon ) . 
  he plundered his way around south america , was the first englishman to circumnavigate the globe which he did after looting a treasure ship and many bases up west coast of chile . 
  there is thousand of other notables , but i think those three are arguably the most ` hero ' esque . 
  although special mention to ** the duke of wellington ** ( a man called arthur who ` saved britain from the french ' , told you he would be back !, 
  ) , for his victories on the continent . 
  particularly waterlooo . 
  i use military people because to me ` hero ' means he who does heroic deeds , and while coming up with the laws of motion and evolution , inventing penicillin or computers are incredible deeds of great men , they are not ` heroic acts ' . 
  scotland is more anti-eu than london . 
  though less anti-uk than everwhere else . 
  44 % of scots want to leave , 40 % of londoners and 49 % of the rest of the uk . 
  really not that much in it ... 
  well if it 's supposed to be a powerful union and loses one its most prominent members it clearly can not be that good . 
  the uk also holds the number one spot in ` soft power ' in the world , and losing it from the eu does n't exactly scream stability . 
  the netherlands is the almost great empire . 
  almost had the south of africa , almost had australia , almost had the north american coastline ( well some of it ) . 
  sweden/denmark have had more wars between them than england/france . 
  interestingly france is probably our closest ally in europe now . 
  we share a huge amount of stuff , we even share militaries to a slight degree . 
  i think the eu will suffer too , it will lose one of the powers stopping france and germany doing their thing . 
  it will lose one of the largest net contributors and it looks like a bit of a joke on the international stage . 
  i think the uk leaving is a very bad thing for everyone . 
  just pour custard on cheese on toast and pretend it 's pudding !, 
  is key-lime pie literally just a lime version of the lemon meringue pie ? 
  lime is even better than lemon , and in pie form it is perfect . 
  lemon meringue pie ( or lime ) , is incredible . 
  i consider myself quite the connoisseur , having tasted pie from many different continents and countries . 
  incidentally south africans are not so great at it , but very generous with the portions . 
  where as the aussies make a superb pie . 
  well yeah , they are all european . 
  even the canadians !, 
  even if they are europeans that moved out . 
  your british ... moving to canada is about is hard as invading paris . 
  slightly confused . 
  is that 118million , or ( more likely ) , 119k ? 
  they are so xenophobic their black people have built an entire culture to get away from it . 
  yeah but so does north america and australasia . 
  both of those have a heavy british history . 
  people relate closer to the british history than just ` european ' . 
  it 's not really surprising . 
  that may have sounded a little millitaristic but it was n't supposed to be . 
  i mean political and ` soft ' power . 
  the eu is already the largest economy on earth , it should n't be too long before the euro becomes replaces the dollar as the most powerful currency . 
  i also believe the eu will take the lead in research . 
  i think china produces the most research papers at the moment , unless it has not quite overtaken the us yet . 
  well that was kind of my point ( i think ) , the money is working to build up and redistribute the wealth a little . 
  we should hopefully get to the point where more nations are making a ` profit ' . 
  very true , that country has had odd boarders ... 
  see !, 
  knew there would be something . 
  greenland is technically north america , but i would be interested to see that join . 
  in all fairness historically speaking macedonia is almost entirely outside of the modern country . 
  keep in mind the eu is young and has not had time to actually improve properly . 
  it 's still in the expansion phase , grabbing as much territory as possible . 
  after that comes the build up , which is being worked on at the same time as expansion . 
  each territory is improved upon . 
  finally the eu will take it 's place as the dominant power , when money is not being thrown at the poorer nations it will be available to spend on mega projects , research and if need be military . 
  i think the eu will be a lot more appealing at that stage . 
  well it 's supposed to be a bit of fun more than anything . 
  i am certain there is more than that , but i can not think of it at the moment . 
  just go down the pub on a friday night . 
  do n't they have their own one on a different date ? 
  well no-one can be 100 % sure , however the tories did n't win last time . 
  this time they backstabbed everyone and pissed off all the students . 
  in their favour there is little other choice . 
  lib dems would have been more popular had they not also backstabbed everyone and sold out their principle for a minute in the light . 
  labour are still unpopular after the blair debacle and illegal wars . 
  ukip might get more votes due to protest , or the vote could be split up again and we get another hung parliament . 
  in which case the tories could once again just gang up with other parties and seize parliament . 
  the vast majority of a countries income ends up in the pockets of the 0.1 % , 1 million a year is more like 1 % . 
  which is only a fraction of the countries income . 
  i think his point is you need to tax the 0.1 % not just the 1 % if you actually want to make money . 
  people celebrate thanksgiving outside of the us ? 
  being proud of your country is patriotism , thinking your country is better then everyone else is nationalism . 
  come take it back ... 
  jousting , and other such games . 
  proper sports , with swords and shields . 
  the only competition is france and germany really .
