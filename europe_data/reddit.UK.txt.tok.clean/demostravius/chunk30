  all hell breaks loose , which ends in many sunk ships on both sides , however hawke and drake manage to escape , and if memory serves i think they kidnaped the local leaders nephew as well . 
  is it just me or do all your heroes have a similar theme ? 
  hadrians wall was put up because scotland was full of hills and fighting guerrilla wars with the locals would have been a pain . 
  it 's the same reason wales was n't conquered . 
  they locals where not godly warriors the only people the romans could not win again . 
  they just lived in a shitty place the romans did n't want . 
  edit : that may have come off as a little harsh . 
  scotland has a huge amount to be proud of , pretending their ancestors where somehow amazing warriors strong enough to take on the roman empire though is just propaganda . 
  it 's a tame version of the whole ` britons are better than everyone because we had a global empire ' , nope , just lucky with geography . 
  used to be , did n't it ? 
  nah , he was clearly gay in the film , which makes it fact . 
  britain did n't invent the slave trade ... slaves had been traded around the world for thousands of years before we did it . 
  the portuguese where the first people to trade across the atlantic and they where the biggest traders . 
  damn , we are amazing . 
  also some rugby world cups !, 
  you where invited , punch was served !, 
  ( we do n't count it toward the ` no successful invasion in nearly 1000 years ' , thing ), 
  abolition of slavery and piracy . 
  industrial revolution the enlightenment . 
  awkward , considering there is pretty much single digit number of countries further north !, 
  keep in mind a large portion of the population are elderly and may genuinely not have watched it . 
  roger , thanks . 
  seems slightly odd to me , what happens if there is no crossing lights ? 
  i assume it only counts near them ? 
  not sure if i should be proud or slightly ashamed ... 
  bosnia according to [ this ] ( http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majormode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=c$ts;sp=6;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=xcoords;iid=phawcnavuyj1jimakmq1img;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=ycoords;iid=phawcnavuyj3os9lvo%5fprda;by=ind$inc_s;univalue=8.21;iid=phawcnavuyj0xoobl%5fn5taq;by=ind$inc_c;univalue=255;gid=catid0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;datamin=199;datamax=42642$map_y;scale=lin;datamin=0.2;datamax=6.3$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds= ) ( note the uk at the bottom next to germany ), 
  i was in newcastle with some friends a few months ago . 
  we had an apartment rented , it got to just past midnight and we had some music playing rather loudly . 
  there is a knock on the door , and we think we are in trouble . 
  turned out to be 5 drunk norwegians , so they came bursting in and we ended up talking to them for hours , great guys , with the possible exception of the one passing out with his trousers around his ankles . 
  they then proceeded to appear at random times/days throughout the week to say hi . 
  two peanuts where walking down ze strazen . 
  one was assaulted ... ... peanut . 
  i find if you avoid the cities , and asda we are fine . 
  just do n't go to newcastle , my god those girls are all orange . 
  in zimbabwe we had a free booze cruise . 
  sang on the bus on the way back to vic falls ( in all fairness the spaniards and french joined in , the germans scowled , but they where over 60 ) , had a fight in a liquor store over who ripped the $ 50 note ( they wo n't accept damaged money ) , climbed in the back of someones pick up truck to get a lift back to the house , decided to go car surfing down a road with speed bumps , skinny dipping in the pool , photographing my naked friend being dry humped while he is on all fours throwing up , and finally passing out in a chair outside which resulted in being bitten by so many mosquitoes we where red by the morning . 
  not with me it 's not !, 
  i do that too !, 
  you always put the milk first if you make the tea in a pot . 
  if you use a tea bag , it 's milk last . 
  anyone who deviates from this is worse than a frenchman . 
  also beans on toast . 
  do n't worry i would do the same thing . 
  a friend of mine tried to drag me to the front of a queue once , and i had to forcibly run from her and queue properly . 
  87 % in 5.35 m bleh . 
  somehow lost finland and clicked a few wrong countries there !, 
  100 % but it took 2mins 13 seconds . 
  stupid screen shrunk and made malta invisible !, 
  had to zoom in and out to fix it . 
  in your face france !, 
  we do indeed , though only on a day to day basis . 
  anything used internationally , or professionally will be done in metric . 
  ranging from a carpenter fitting a window frame , to an engineer designing advanced spacefaring equipment . 
  i fully understand the desire to stick to imperial but changing benefits everyone . 
  it 's inevitable the uk will switch to kph at some point . 
  if you use imperial all the time at work , then switch to metric just for a few projects things are more likely to go wrong . 
  yeah that makes sense ... 
  someone just linked something about a $ 125million probe being destroyed due to someone forgetting to convert . 
  find me an example of a ` u ' doing that . 
  it 's not the only example , wrong sized bits are posted abroad on occasion . 
  i read something about aeroplane pieces not fitting after being ordered from the states . 
  mistakes happen , it 's inevitable and should be calculated into costs . 
  however using the same measuring system would reduce these . 
  is that yours ? 
  the us is pretty much the only country in the world to still use this out-dated system and all it does it cause problems . 
  there is no benefit at all from using imperial units . 
  at the moment it 's not a big issue for the states , however in the long run the us economy will go down , others will rise and the us will find itself losing buyers . 
  he was n't elected . 
  he lost the election , however one of the other parties sided with him ( despite being the polar opposite in views ) in an attempt to have power i guess . 
  teaming up meant they had the majority and took office . 
  no-one , anywhere voted for this , frankly i think it 's appalling it was allowed . 
  now this unelected bozo is spouting tripe for reasons best known to him . 
  you know that has n't happened right ? 
  it 's just one ( non-elected ) idiot spouting stuff no-one agrees with . 
  i worked in australia with window film which we imported from the states . 
  the entire thing was measured in ` mils ' which to any normal person would be 1/1000th of a metre . 
  however no because of the use of imperial units that actually means 1/1000 of an inch , which is of course massively different . 
  it just wastes so much time having to explain it to every customer or else convert it to bizarre lengths . 
  for example the rolls come in lengths of 918mm , 1024mm or 1536mm . 
  nice round number to make cutting and calculation easy !, 
  it 's daft in general . 
  english is the lingua franca on a global scale . 
  creating another new language just for europe would alienate us from canada/australia/india and the us . 
  it would also hamper communications with every other country on earth because they would n't have a business language . 
  it would be either learn ` eurolanguage ' , english ( us ) or spanish . 
  currently everyone mostly learns english for national trade . 
  throwing another languge in the works for absolutely no reason is frankly a terrible idea . 
  english is the lingua franca of europe . 
  could work , i do n't know enough about running a country to make more than an educated guess . 
  though i can promise under that system cornwall will complain !, 
  i would like a better system of governing , but due to englands large population any representative system will result in less say for scotland . 
  the best system may be to break england up into more population based chunks , or give each region equal say ignoring population . 
  yea , pretty much . 
  you think estonia has as much clout in the eu and on a global scale ? 
  of course not . 
  the uk is one of the few members of the un with a veto , one of the strongest powers in the eu and has a big voice on a global scale . 
  you need a big population to be properly heard , because you actually have something to bargin with . 
  once scotland breaks off they lose that power , why do you think the uk , france and germany have the most influence in europe ? 
  population and stability .
