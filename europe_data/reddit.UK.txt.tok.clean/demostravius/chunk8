  looks a lot less aggressive , the dirty one looks like it 's been used to beat people with . 
  heavily weighted toward the anglosphere . 
  i like it . 
  i refuse to be under a flag that has that much yellow on it . 
  or perhaps a [ unicorn ] ( http://www.hope-of-israel.org/img/lion%20&amp;%20unicorn094.jpg ) ? 
  damn . 
  with that flag europe would have no choice but the start violently colonising again . 
  looks rather more militant to me , maybe something we can fly once we federalise the military . 
  i do n't think it has anything to do with intelligence . 
  all those countries are in the eurozone which is struggling to drag up a few members , none of the anglosphere has a currency tie making it easier to recover . 
  i do n't get it either , i only recently found out that was the finished look . 
  the gherkin is awesome but other than that i am somewhat ambivalent to most modern buildings . 
  `` this led to the only bloodshed during the war on june 15 , 1811 , when major-general hampus m\u00f6rner with 140 men acted to disperse a group of farmers in kl\u00e5gerup in scania who objected to the conscription policy . 
  in the kl\u00e5gerup riots , ** m\u00f6rner 's soldiers killed 30 farmers ** . '', 
  it 's right there in the article you linked . 
  we had a war with sweden once , never bothered sending any troops over but the swedes still managed to have casualties . 
  you go to jail for 25 years for robbing a shop , or you still go to jail for 25 years for beating/shooting the cop . 
  may as well try and escape through any means necessary . 
  a lot of states use three strikes for only violent crime , which is a little more effective . 
  [ slate article ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/2008/03/going_down_swinging.html ) comes to the conclusions that the laws lowers the chance of people reoffending by 18 % for first strike , 28 % for second strike , but those that do reoffend tend to become violent , numbers of assaults increases . 
  it 's lowering the re-offense rate , but increasing the chance of them being violent , which is the exact opposite the laws are supposed to do . 
  [ california ] ( http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/696/3/assessing-the-impact-of-three-strikes-laws-on-crime-rates-and-prison-populations-in-california-and-washington ) in particular has seen a slower decrease in crime to other states and uses the three strike rule very strictly . 
  [ this ] ( http://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/9405 ) article puts alcohol reduction as the cause of crime dropping and three strikes just incarnates people for no good reason , costing the state . 
  [ standford ] ( https://www.law.stanford.edu/organizations/programs-and-centers/stanford-three-strikes-project/three-strikes-basics ) , revoking the three strikes law could save $ billion over 10 years in california alone . 
  the three strike rule in the us has lead to an increase in violence why would it work here ? 
  australia is just brilliant for sushi and thai . 
  must have had sushi every morning for half a year working out there . 
  i 've seen the claws those bastards have , they are lethal !, 
  but ... we are part of the same country !, 
  ca n't we just all agree london sucks and be done with it ? 
  aww , baked camembert studded with tyme , and some nice crusty bread to dip in it . 
  i need some . 
  see , now if i come to the us i have a huge couple of mm longer penis than everyone else and a super sexy british accent . 
  just need to get my teeth replaced with plastic and i am golden . 
  i really want that rebuilt . 
  it was used to house international science and engineering fayres , it would be brilliant to get them back . 
  we have farnborough for aviation , lets get the palace for other engineering . 
  the thing i love about london 's skyline is the sheer randomness . 
  the gherkin , the eye , st. pauls , etc. 
  you should look up the mexico city earthscraper . 
  i think poland wins . 
  it may not be the tallest , but just look at that architecture !, 
  i do yes , i have a couple of american friends who married english guys . 
  honestly one , loves it here , the other likes it for the most part but has had trouble with people being rude . 
  it could just be normal rude people but due to the fact it 's anti-american it sticks out more . 
  well you say that but i know americans in the uk who say they have suffered quite a lot of abuse ( verbally ) . 
  the us popularity in the uk is very low . 
  you are quite right of course , although if someone does n't have the social net to get them the help i feel the state should have aid/care appointed . 
  although that still gives you the problem of finding them in the first place . 
  does this mean i can no longer masturbate into the fridge ? 
  if someone starves to death without telling anyone he is in trouble , there is clearly something mentally wrong with him and it 's the states duty to fix that . 
  really ? 
  there is being bias then there is being plain ignorant . 
  regardless of wether or not crimea wanted to be part of russia , he still flat out invaded and annexed it , which is down right worrying and illegal . 
  then their vote happened during an occupation and came out to the exact percentage predicted the week earlier . 
  the civil war certainly has it 's roots in the euromaiden but as you just said russia has backed the seperaratists , without that backing this would not have happened . 
  you are right there is no direct proof of russia shooting down the flight , but there is no other feasible method for the rebels to have got hold of such apparatus . 
  sanctions are currently the only method of dealing with him and they do little , you suggest we ignore him or there is another method i am missing ? 
  fuck everyone else , i got mine . 
  just curious but do you live under a stone ? 
  have you missed the invading , annexing , the potential restart of the cold war , the ukrainian civil war , the shooting down of a civilian aircraft , the constant threats , etc. 
  he is trying to isolate russia from the rest of the world , how is that good for russia ? 
  [ woop , woop , woop , woop ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rnw0d2adyu ) . 
  it 's a european forum , name one subject that can rally all europeans together faster than distaste for russia . 
  no sah !, 
  i poop on you sah !, 
  bally heroes , highly trained from egg , burst through enemy lines to drop a bouncing turd on putins shoulder . 
  fortunately it turned out to be a huge rib-eye steak ` the size of an elephant turd ' . 
  best place to be !, 
  all the troops will be in poland fighting back , it 's berlin , london and paris that will get nuked . 
  i ordered elephant turd at a restaurant in zimbabwe once . 
  it was very tasty , came with a peppercorn sauce . 
  you are right , ukraine is n't comparable to his example , but neither is britain comparable to either . 
  in all fairness britain took resources and money , rather than training and gear . 
  clearly some gear was lent but for the most part is was manufactured over here and used by highly trained individuals . 
  the examples vestrati gave where rather different . 
  an englishman and a scotsman are walking along when they find a magic lamp . 
  the scotsman rubs it and out pops a genie granting them one wish each . 
  the scotsman says : `` i want a massive wall surrounding the entire country so i do n't have to put up with the english anymore '' `` your wish is granted , englishman what is your wish ? '', 
  the englishman says : `` fill it with water '' . 
  the irish are just so hammered they do n't know their own names . 
  no birdhouses or statues ? 
  what monsters . 
  gnomes and fake sunflowers , fair enough though . 
  an englishman , a scotsman and an irishman are running from the police after a heist . 
  they detour down a dead end by mistake . 
  the englishman dives into a nearby barrel , the scotsman jumps into a crate and the irishman slips into a sack . 
  the police catch up but do n't see anyone . 
  `` maybe they are in the barrel '' the englishman goes `` meow '' . 
  `` ah , it 's just a cat , perhaps they are in the crate ! '', 
  the scotsman goes `` squeek '' . 
  `` ah , it 's just a mouse , perhaps they are in the sack ! '', 
  the irishman yells `` potatoes !, 
  i once sat on a boat floating down the zambezi river , being served gin and tonics and watching the elephants and hippos do their thing . 
  i just wish i had my pith helmet as that would have made it perfect . 
  if you think coke is n't a decent drink you are a nut case . 
  we produced so much food in india the population boomed . 
  unfortunatly we then took it all away again ... 
  well we still do n't have a definition of a continent now days . 
  it is clearly an island though , it 's also one political entity unlike all other continents .
