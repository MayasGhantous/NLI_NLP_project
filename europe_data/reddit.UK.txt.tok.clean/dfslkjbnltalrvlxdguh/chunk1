none  but i did get to play with [ wallabies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wallaby ) when they came to our school , as well as shear a sheep . 
  i was born in wales of all places and never got to shear a sheep there . 
  but in australia , not a problem , have a go mate lol ( to a 7 year old ) :-) we lived in sydney in dover heights on military road ( google maps it ) near the park / grass area . 
  not many kangaroos there i 'm afraid . 
  did visit the [ blue mountains ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=blue+mountains ) a few times and saw [ drop bears ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koala ) in their natural habitat . 
  i do n't think i ever saw a roo , in person . 
   so , what do you know about australia ? 
  i lived there in my childhood . 
  ama . 
  oh , then we can just ignore it , then . 
  how convenient . 
  even krishnas dislike gays , man . 
  i 'm so glad we are leaving the eu . 
  i * like * having high roaming charges . 
  neither was mine - you 're not the only one who either said or felt that given by the votes  i was just being pithy anyway , sorry for any offense , 
  apparently not  <, 
  then 1000 people are idiots . 
  the username is the result of my striking my fingers across the keyboard . 
  i stay logged in with cookies , and if it does log me out , i have to go back and search a recent post to go copy and paste the username , if that helps :p the joke was that i had a sensible username like , idk , stephenfrys , and my password was actually dfslkjbnltalrvlxdguh . 
  so in upside down world , my username is dfslkjbnltalrvlxdguh and my password would be stephenfrys . 
  but actually my password is $ up3r $ secrit . 
  oh , that 's my password . 
  my password is my username . 
  heh i support this notion . 
  the point is he 's not scottish . 
  besides , i was born in cork but moved to the uk when i was 2 days old . 
  am i english , then ? 
  v0v from 6-13 i grew up in sydney . 
  am i australian ? 
  i dunno , it says he was born in dublin , if that means he 's from cork then that 's cool . 
  i have no strong feelings on where he 's from other than i know he is n't scottish . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/graham_norton#early_life  norton was born in clondalkin , a suburb of dublin , and grew up in bandon , county cork . 
  ireland , he 's from dublin . 
  e : grew up in cork apparently, 
  oh lol i love eu . 
   i do n't think most people even think this , let alone are not happy about it ooo there 's a fair few . 
  they do n't * understand * it , but they know that scotland is taking england 's money and it must be stopped . 
  they just spend it on fried food and haggis . 
  that 's obviously not my view but it 's one i 've seen expressed . 
  people always have strong opinions on stuff they do n't know about . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wob2kqhr7v0 kinda touches on it @ 7 mins, 
  on the drop down , just type `` united k '' and it 'll highlight it for you . 
  how many voted to leave the eu in scotland ? 
  35 % was it ? 
  ( give or take ) ? 
  that ai n't due to * english * nationalism , i feel safe in making that statement . 
  majority of usa citizens felt trump was an idiot but look where we are . 
  e : \\* sigh * i mean more people voted for clinton than trump . 
  really ? 
  downvotes ? 
  are we just denying reality now ? 
  the * point * was , that just because the majority of the french think the nf is dumb , does n't mean they wo n't get in solely on that reason . 
  `` get out and vote '' . 
  always about 10 years behind the times in fashion  < well , 35 years for the shellsuits . 
   what were the controversial tweet pictures ? 
  anyone has them because i cant find it . 
  pictures of beheadings of i think french citizens . 
  they 've been taken down / removed now . 
  there 's possibly a twitter archive somewhere - or live leak 'll have a copy somewhere, 
   but they 're not that great . 
  get out . 
   that suggests losing her immunity had nothing to do with the pictures . 
  it does . 
  i 'll expand a little below . 
   as for apologetic , you seem to indicate that posting pictures is indeed a heinous crime , that france has every right to persecute . 
  legally , it does . 
  feel free to look at every one of my posts in this thread - no where will you see me saying she is guilty . 
  in fact you 'll see me * defending * her as not been found guilty . 
  it 's not mean to come across as apologetic , i 'm merely explaining the situation . 
  posting pictures of dead people is fine in france . 
  once someone is dead , they lose their right to privacy . 
  however , the * relatives * of the deceased * can * request that pictures not be shown out of respect . 
  and if they are able to prove a sense of `` pain '' or `` hurt '' or `` emotional turmoil '' as a result , they are able to make a complaint . 
  this is what has happened . 
  now , the law itself is n't clear cut . 
  and she has n't gone to trial yet . 
  in fact she 's not yet been prosecuted or charged . 
  the only reason the european parliament is involved is because she posted the pictures in her capacity as a mep , not as a private citizen . 
  as an mep she is immune from certain prosecutions . 
  that in itself is interesting - i would think lepen would be furious that france was being told by the ep that they ca n't prosecute one of their own . 
  lepen would be the * first * to say non !, 
  and that the ep is taking over france 's justice system and taking over france 's laws . 
  that is , in fact , half her platform . 
  so there 's a bit of irony for you . 
  anyway , she 's pissed off enough representatives that they 've shrugged their shoulders and told france `` sure . 
  she 's all yours . '', 
  what france * does * with that now , is up to them . 
  if it does go to court , this will be know as a `` test case '' . 
  these laws are very rarely challenged in court . 
  there are similar cases to do with violent images , sexual images etc in the uk that i 'm aware of , that were prosecuted under what seem to be very similar laws . 
  nearly every one of those has been thrown out of court . 
  so there 's a good chance that she will be found not guilty , * if * this even goes to court . 
  it 's not gone to court yet . 
  france just wanted the ability to prosecute one of their own . 
  which in and of itself , is fair enough . 
  whether that law is fair or not , or whether the motivations behind france 's requests are political - well . 
  even * i * am not blind . 
  ;-) but will that ever be proven ? 
  unlikely . 
  and , as it is , everything is so far going according to law .
