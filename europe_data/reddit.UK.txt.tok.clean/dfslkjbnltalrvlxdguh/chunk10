  she 's not powerless . 
  she just does n't use it . 
  ya know , cos she has class and knows how to behave herself . 
  unlike some orange politicians :p and btw , i 'm not even a royalist . 
   the queen only outranks someone if they actually believe she does . 
  what 's she gunna do , chop my head off ? 
  i doubt it 'd be an issue as you 're unlikely to get called to a royal banquet or diplomatic function in the near future , 
  the uk has declared war over a * lot * less before :p i dunno . 
  probably an ambulance and some apologies . 
  t_d would go apeshit over the `` power '' he 's projected , 99 % of the rest of the world would be just watching without blinking and with open mouths and the uk would get a sweet trade deal  <, 
  that 's why i said `` in those days '' - queen victoria was empress of india etc. 
  yes it is . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/head_of_state https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diplomatic_rank https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_heads_of_state_by_diplomatic_precedence enjoy , 
  then yes as head of state , he out-ranks her :-) he would n't out-rank queen victoria though - they 'd be equals . 
  though in those days , he 'd technically `` win '' by being a man . 
  yup , assuming he 's head of state as well ( i do n't know ) . 
  if so , yes . 
  in that in diplomatic functions he 'll get called first , seated first etc , yes . 
  he 'll sign the documents first for a treaty etc. 
  though in our case , the queen does n't sign them anyway so that 's not an issue . 
  well * exactly * , 
  yus , there 's this whole international protocol thing on it . 
  a prince can be head of state , but he 's `` out-ranked '' by a queen who is head of state . 
  but not by a queen who is not head of state . 
  a queen ( or king ) can be out-ranked by and emperor or empress . 
  i do n't think we have any of those ( really ) any more . 
  president is below queen in the protocols . 
  none of this matters except at huge banquets where `` who sits next to who '' is decided . 
  but in the `` ranks '' of world leaders , queen elizabeth outranks potus when it comes to `` diplomatic protocol '' . 
  it comes from blackadder talking about the scarlet pimpernel . 
  http://blackadder.wikia.com/wiki/nob_and_nobility `` they seek him here , they seek him there , those frenchies seek him everywhere . 
  is he in heaven or is he in hell ? ... '', 
  and blackadder chips in with '' ... and what 's that revolting garlic smell ? '', 
  for me at least . 
  i dunno i go through 2-3 bulbs a week in my cooking here . 
  i fucking love garlic . 
  you wait till he meets queen elizabeth . 
  he has to hold her hand ( not shake it ) when she offers it - due to rank and all . 
  queen and head of state outranks president and head of state . 
  edit : for the below ( and downvoted ) shitstorm of t_d posters replying that usa potus  all the world : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_heads_of_state_by_diplomatic_precedence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/head_of_state https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diplomatic_rank nope !, 
  it 's all there . 
  and for everyone else , please do n't mistake `` diplomatic protocol '' for `` military rank '' as some people ( t_d and trumpets ) seem to think . 
  edit 2 : hey all - there 's a lot of responses below . 
  first off - ok i apologise for saying `` trumpets '' and stuff . 
  i am ... 
  i do n't like trump but that 's not the issue here . 
  whether it is trump or obama or bush ii or in 2024 when it 's president harry styles or noelle bush or whatever - these are internationally recognised `` diplomatic protocols '' . 
  the reason i am being so centric on british royal protocols is because the question was originally about the queen and trump meeting . 
  i do not expect trump to know the protocols . 
  that 's not anti trump - that 's he 's too busy as potus . 
  obama had the same issue : [ us president barack obama suffers embarrassing royal toast mishap at queen 's banquet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnrxgrfjddy ) - by the uk telegraph ( not tabloid , but centre-right . 
  not anti obama though ) . 
  here , his advisors did n't tell him when he stands up and says her name ... ye ... the band plays ... and yeah . . he `` got '' it . 
  he understood within 4 seconds of starting . 
  he could stop or go on . 
  he went on  < it was lols . 
  i am not `` partisan '' on `` diplomatic protocols '' . 
  everyone fucks up . 
  even our `` second in command '' :d [ phillip ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02347/prince_2347916b.jpg ) his ( trump 's ) * advisors * ** must ** tell him how to do this right . 
  this is n't me being `` all ukish '' about it - qe2 is essentially `` the head of the diplomatic world '' , baring one or two very specific circumstances . 
  as below in the thread , `` whether she deserves this or not '' is n't the point - she * is * . 
  should a monarch exist ? 
  is it fair ? 
  are uk citizens `` slaves '' or `` subjects '' ? 
  - well , this is n't the thread for that ( ask in a new thread in this sub - we 're still in the eu for the next year or so ! ), 
  but the fact is `` she * is * '' and `` we * are * '' and `` he 's coming * here * '' and there are * internationally recognised standards - just like iso standards * . 
  and just like iso standards , they 're not `` law '' , but anyone who does n't follow them does n't do business . 
  trump is all about business . 
  so far , he 's pissed off every head of state he 's met except putin . 
  what happens when he meets the most experienced head of state on the planet ? 
  `` lols '' , is what i 'm expecting , from a very leftist , republican brit . 
  ** edit 3 ** there are some questions below as to why the uk needs to be so `` prissy '' about this shit . 
  that 's a good question . 
  and i ca n't really answer that . 
  we just are . 
  this is how the uk works . 
  that 's not really a circular agument btw , i could totally expand on that ( heh i ramble too much anyway ) but i could , for brevity , switch it around . 
  only a select few world leaders normally get to goin the oval office . 
  oh , they go to camp david and similar retreats ( there 's a fort something as well ? ), 
  - and when bush was in charge he took some leaders to his ranch . . and trump took some people to mar a largo . 
  i do n't think bush 's ranch was filled with russian , chinese and other spies . 
  anyway , there 's similar protocols in the usa . 
  who comes out of the plane first , who is greeted first ... who the president ( and guests ) salute and greet and in which order . 
  is this strange to the usa ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  [ usa `` head of state '' crowds ] ( https://www.usnews.com/dims4/usnews/927f932/2147483647/resize/300x%3e/quality/85/?url=%2fcmsmedia%2f3a%2fb7d9bb0081603efef48d70e38e0062%2f36812fe_da_130108_inaug.jpg ) [ uk `` head of state '' crowds ] ( http://www.shoppersshop.com/2011pics/royal_wedding_well_wishers_buckingham_palace.jpg ) ya know - this shit goes on whatever country . 
  `` oh the uk 's got a * monarchy * '' yeah she does n't fking * do * anything other than suck in your tourist dollars :p also < 3 americans , seriously . 
  this is only half a mean prod , we do love you guys . 
  yes even the `` trump votors '' for a lot of you , yes we do understand certain frustrations about jobs and the economy . 
  we have similar coal / steel collapses here . 
  the difference here is the government helps with support . 
  i do n't believe trump or the republicans stand for that . 
  but i 'm just a brit so i do n't mean to be `` mean '' ... anyway ... 
  and garlic . 
   uh ... he was trying to tell me who the core voters are in a referendum in the uk . 
  i corrected him . 
  yet you attack me ? 
  that 's not what happened . 
   core means the same thing in every language english : core spanish : nucle\u00f3 http://www.dictionary.com/browse/core?s=t http://dictionary.reverso.net/spanish-english/n%c3%bacleo could mean a thunderstorm . 
  or an atomic nucleus .
