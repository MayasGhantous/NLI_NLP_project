  they 're not doing anything sneaky or treating her different than they would someone else . 
  other than it 's very high profile . 
  to be clear - her losing immunity was * not * because she posted anything . 
  she lost her immunity because france requested it . 
  the ep did not vote on whether to prosecute her , they did not vote on whether she 's broken any laws , they did not vote on whether they think she is guilty or not . 
  france asked `` please can you remove her immunity '' and they took a vote . 
  they probably voted against her out of * spite * , yes . 
  but that 's politics . 
  do n't piss off an entire parliament and expect them to have your back ? 
  \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af i dunno what to say there or if anyone expected * any * other result lol . 
  but that 's not an apology , it 's just the situation as i can see it . 
  some of the small details may be a little off - i 'm not french and i do n't follow lepen that closely , but it is i think a fairly ok summary . 
  i do n't know whether she is guilty or not . 
  that is for a french court to determine . 
  a french court for a french citizen who may or may not have broken a french law . 
  regardless of the citizen or law , you do agree a country has the right to prosecute their own citizens , and that the eu or the ep should not stand in the way ? 
  i know lepen agrees with that statement . 
  in principle , at least . 
  ;-) hope this helps explain my post a bit further in any case . 
   i 'm sorry , but your justification is incoherent and frankly apologetic . 
  could you expand on which points are incoherent ? 
   also , what an extremely invasive and , in fact fascist , law . 
  take it up with france . 
   just got banned from / r/worldnews for posting in defense of her right to free speech . 
  what was the * real * reason ? 
  ahh , the mature approach to a situation . 
   please refrain from posting content not allowed by the government . 
  i do n't get your meaning ? 
   no , i was genuinely unaware of this legal technicality i 'll explain a little why she has it to begin with - as a mep , she has this `` immunity '' which is granted to many politicians in many countries and organisations . 
  the uk has one called parliamentary privilege where one of our mps can say whatever they like in parliament and not get prosecuted for it ( aside from revealing , idk the nuclear codes or something i guess . 
  there 's a line , but it 's very high up ) . 
  the us senate has similar stuff and so does france and germany and many others . 
  however the ep is not soverign over france , no matter what lepen says . 
  the eu does * not * have the power to over-ride nation 's laws * unless * that nation has agreed to surrender their powers in that particular area . 
  that 's all part of the original treaty agreements . 
  these days , there are `` set rules '' for countries that do over-ride their internal stuff . 
  but , like britain , france has it 's own share of rules they choose to follow and not follow , when it 's convenient for them . 
  and so does germany and so does italy . 
  that 's why they have power and greece got fucked over . 
  ( what makes this so ironic is she spends her time saying the eu is so powerful and their members are `` untouchable '' and `` above the law '' . 
  she says the eu is stealing sovereign justice and laws from france ... well ... look in the mirror , marie . 
  because ... literally ... it turns out that the ep member 's are n't above the law . 
  they are n't able to get away with stuff . 
  and also france * can * over-rule the eu regulations on this . 
  irony for you . 
  france , like the uk and germany , has * the best fucking deal possible and controls the eu you twits !, 
  * ) anyway , being an mep means being in the ep you can say stuff when `` on duty '' . 
  lepen tweeted stuff , it appears , in her * capacity * as mep , but it 's stuff that 's internal to france 's politics ( the election ) . 
  normally , what she tweeted would be illegal . 
  however as mep she ca n't be prosecuted for it because she did it * as * an mep . 
  her views do not reflect the majority of the ep . 
  therefore when france said `` yo , can you revoke her immunity privilege ( not * right * ) they said `` sure '' . 
  now france is free to prosecute - * if it chooses * - marie lepen for violating french equivalents of obscenity and privacy laws . 
  in that case , the family will need to prove that lepen has hurt their feelings . 
  i have no fucking clue how that is going to work . 
  but those are the facts as far as i know them . 
  i do n't know if she 's guilty or not . 
  she posted it , sure . 
  was it against the law ? 
  i do n't know . 
  no one does , until this test case goes forward . 
  there is n't much past precedent for it for us to fall back on and estimate . 
  that 's why it 's so controversial . 
   sharing picture of a dead person is not illegal in france . 
  * unless * the relatives of the dead person can convince a jury that they have been personally hurt and affected by the photo 's use . 
  that 's the law . 
  http://www.murielle-cahen.com/publications/image-mort.asp which is exactly what this is based on . 
  now , whether they * can * convince a jury or a judge or magistrate or arbitrator or whatever ... that 's what the case is for . 
  we 'll find out . 
  this is entirely an internal french matter . 
   so it does n't matter if she was sharing pictures of beheading , pictures of mass shooting or pictures of flowers . 
  she is still only sharing a picture . 
  unless they family can convince that they were affected by it personally and hurt or morally affected . 
   and since she removed it when requested by the family , i am curious to see what are they going to charge her with . 
  well , if i steal someone 's bike , and then a week later give it back , i can still get arrested for theft . 
   that said , i doubt any of this is actually going to hurt le pen 's chances . 
  me neither , heh . 
  ... yes . 
  there is no `` eu parliament '' there 's the eu council and there is the european parliament . 
  the ep is a smaller subset of the eu as a whole , but is not directly related to the eu council . 
  the european union ( eu ) is a trading block and alliance . 
  i am eu . 
  france is eu . 
  belgian chocolate is eu . 
  the european union is not tangible . 
  it 's not a `` thing '' . 
  it 's an agreement . 
  that might sound like a rather strange response but there is no over-arching `` eu '' * thing * that ... * does stuff * . 
   those pictures have been shared on twitter . 
  there 's even a public tv channel that broadcasted a video of the attack . 
  as far as i know people complained but no charges have been pressed against anyone . 
  from what i could understand , only relatives of a dead person can make such a request . 
  maybe the relatives of the victim on the beheading pictures lepen tweeted made a complaint against lepen - for a good reason ( left or right politics aside ) - it is * politicising * the death of a family member . 
  i , too , would be outraged if a political party too my husband / brother / father 's death as a political campaign picture officially posted by the leader of a party . 
  any party . 
  but that 's just me . 
  in any event - i have in no post in this thread ( and i 've made about 40 of them ) said she is guilty . 
  i can say she posted the pictures . 
  i am not qualified to say whether doing so broke the law . 
  the only thing i am doing is explaining what the law is , and why she has been accused of breaking it .
