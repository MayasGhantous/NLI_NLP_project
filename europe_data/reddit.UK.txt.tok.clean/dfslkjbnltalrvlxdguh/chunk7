  it 's not like they fucked us over for decades ( serious , not sarcasm ) , eh . 
  eh . . meeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeah ok i disagree with the concept of their existence as is , but overall this seems the least disruptive solution . 
  you 're not wrong . 
  you 're also not an asshole :d, 
   would you believe that she 's actually very liberal/a bernie sanders supporter ? 
  ( same here generally ) . 
  who , qe2 ? 
  um ... honestly , she 's kept her mouth shut for 50 years . 
  no , i do notbelieve she 's actually a very . . well , ok ... 
  i do not believe she has expressed an opinion on the subject . 
  :p `` no '' . 
  well , there 's libraries devoted to it , but essentially before the usa was around , europe was fighting among ourselves etc. 
  england ( wales and england ) `` won '' the late middle ages and renassance periods . 
  spain and france tries but overall we `` won '' ( for what that 's worth 400 years later = nothing , and they 're our allies now and friends ) . 
  and we addicted china to heroin ( essentially ) and took over india and jusst `` made up '' pakistain and planted all the muslims there and said `` deal '' . 
  then we also invented israel as it is now . 
  yup . 
  that was us . 
  we went in and carved it up on a map and said `` deal with it '' ( and problem solved , i think ! . . oh ) etc at some point we took over scotland via blackmail , and we fucked over the irish till half of them died because i dunno for the lols ? 
  shit was fucked up . 
  well , i did n't want to brag . 
  u/waitingtobebanned  i did not realise that you were a degenerate when i first responded . 
  my bad . 
  i really do n't know where to start with that other that . . bye ? 
  o / ( e : and i aint even bothering to report you btw ), 
  thanks for answering , that makes sense  we are a bit `` stiff '' and weird . 
  i would say ( without knowing you or your mother ) she seems , like me , to be a republican . 
  that 's not to mean the us republican party , it 's literal meaning and still in use in the uk is essentially `` no monarchy '' . 
  there 's a fair part of the uk that agrees - up to 40 % in some cases if questions are phrased right but , when it comes down to it : - we make money off them overall - queen elizabeth is mad hot around the celebrity circuit . 
  there * is * no one above her :p like it or not . 
  charles will not be the same . 
  no fault to him , he just ... in a weird way he has my support but i think after elizabeth ii passes , we 'll end up like the netherlands . 
  i mean , their king flies their commercial airways ... and william & harry can both fly helicopters ... just sayin ' ... 
  nah we got alan sugar thanks : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cnhll1ihyi it 's all reality tv bollocks . 
  only alan sugar runs some computer stuff for schools and trump is president of the usa so what do i know ? 
  well , i know no matter how shit the uk becomes , i know even if there 's babies being born on the streets full of garbage and measles is everywhere and essentially brimstone is coming out of water fountains at gyms - we would n't elect alan sugar for leader nor would he try : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t43sgu6ki1m `` i 'm not a bloody prophet '' when asked about the economy ( in a 1 hour long q & a which trump has never done . 
  just sayin ' ), 
   and then we have a fire fight between the royal guards and mi5 , and the secret service . 
   that would one extremely one sided . 
  i 'd like to think that everyone misses and at the end of the day it was just . . and everyone 's ok . and we learn some trigger-discipline . 
  if that metaphor is lost on anyone , gosh help you . 
   i hate trump and how he treats world leaders , but my american psychology is seriously kicking in after reading this and making me hope her pulls her arm around like a ragdoll . 
   i know , i know . 
  not cool . 
  and i 'm 90 % joking . 
  but seriously . 
  this sort of thing makes us want him to do it more . 
  which bit ( s ) makes you kick off ? 
  as a uk person ( not a monarchist supporter ) i 'd like to know what you think about having a monarchy  < i might not like it but i 'd like to hear . 
  and what do you mean by `` american psychology '' - not trolling . 
  i really would like - hey do via pm if you like i 'm happy there - i 'd really love your thoughts please , 
  no worries :d, 
   i am confused about this bit on terms of rank ? 
   are we talking about nato or something else because these leaders of a different governments how would their be ranks ? 
  no , it 's not about a military rank - or any kind of official hierarchy . 
  essentially - and this is the truth ( since i 'm tired of arguing at this point ) , you 've got a load of leaders of major countries across the planet . 
  and all of them hail from stupid traditions .

  there is n't one , really . 
  none of that matters . 
  all of them are incredibly petty ... no , that 's not true . 
  all of their * staff * are incredibly petty and so are the media . 
  the actual heads of state , i 'm sure give absolutely ** zero fucks ** about any of it . 
  in fact i 'm 90 % sure other than crazy dictators and banana republic `` people 's republics '' and trump , no one , actually , on that level , really gives a toss . 
  i 'm 99 % ... no , 100 % sure it 's a dick waving contest between all countries everywhere over who can be the most petty over the most silly things . 
  the problem is , re : queen elizabeth ii and president donald trump , i think it 's going to be / o \\ and i think she 's going to find it hillarious . 
  all this is about is `` diplomatic protocols '' . 
  these are n't things in law or set in stone - they 're just traditions . 
  may i ask what country you are from ? 
  :-) ( srs ), 
   just went over the same thing on another thread . 
  cos that is absolutely not trump bowing to that dude . 
  he 's very clearly too tall for the guy trying to put a necklace on him so he 's leaning over . 
  he made it a specific not to bow ( like obama ) . 
  he gave him one of his signature too-aggressive-handshakes or ... ;-) the monarchy king just held his arms out ( like the queen would ) and trump had to bow to accept . 
  he did n't put it around trump 's neck , trump put his neck around the medallion . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zel9n9uxnqa this is indisputable - he bows down , then bends his knees - both of them , then dips his head whilst the monarch head of state king just holds his arms casually . 
  deal with it . 
  i ca n't speak to that but i 'd say merkel for me , tbh :d, 
  we love him no matter what . 
  he has provided many facepalms - he even gives trump a run for his money on `` inappropriate stuff to say to anyone who is n't a white male in privacy '' :d - however he also does n't advocate taking healthcare away from babies or schoolbooks from children , so we like him . 
  also he 's funny . 
   fuck that . 
  we started america so we wouldnt have to bow down to monarchies http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2017/05/20/conservative_outlets_don_t_seem_bothered_by_trump_bowing_to_saudi_king/685748744-president-donald-trump-receives-the-order-of-abdulaziz.jpg.crop.promo-xlarge2.jpg the full live video with audio : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zel9n9uxnqa ... 
  i dare you . 
   i do n't believe she 's entitled to that , no i 'm going to answer this in three different ways out of respect . 
  1 ) i do n't believe she is `` entitled '' to it either . 
  she was born randomly , and just so happened to be the daughter of some ` important dude ' and now she 's ` in charge ' . 
  and before her dad , he had some ` important dude ' as a dad , and that guy had an ... and ` he ' gets it before ` her ' and ` she ' after ` him ' and whatever . 
  there 's no rationality to that being the leader of anything . 
  2 ) i assume you realise she exists and contrary to whatever you might wish to be the case , she * is * all of the above . 
  i mean , that 's an indisputable fact . 
  at no point , you might notice , did i mention her role in the church or any of the `` god '' stuff . 
  the above is just some of her official titles . 
  but ... 
  but ... 
  i presume you acknowledge , 1 ) aside , that she * is * . 
  i mean . . she * is * all of that . 
  right ? 
  3 ) if then ( and not necessarily pertaining to 1 ) or 2 ) ) she exists , what would you suggest potus does , when meeting her - given decades and centuries of traditions ?
