  are you suggesting he do otherwise than the norm ? 
  `` that 's a nice planet you have there . 
  it 'd be a ... * shame * if an east india trading company happened to you ...  i * can not believe * we got away with that for 200 years , it 's ... astounding . 
  the arrogance . 
  i 'm ... not proud of it , in any kind of morale point of view - and i 'd never defend any inumane actions ( and my god there were * genocides * ) but ... that was one hell of a bluff we pulled for ... 400 years . 
  i 'm . . kinda impressed with ourselves there  < considering it all just fell apart in 10 years after ww2 and ... that was ... apparently * that * . 
  well i `` believe in the monarchy '' in so much as elizabeth windsor is sovereign of the royal family order of queen elizabeth ii , head of the royal household , crown of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and queen elizabeth ii of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland exists and is listed and signed as the above with the un , yes . 
  if you do n't believe she 's real , then i suppose yeah , my citations and reasoning does kind of fall flat , i 'll concede that to you . 
   but what about the french president then ? 
  she out-ranks him  < but not napoleon . 
  he was an emperor . 
  napoleon out-ranked victoria ( being a female empress at the time ) and also technically outranked whomever was king of the uk at the time ( george or something ) . 
  that said , being at war , we never had to sit down at a a banquet   just kidding , i wanted to congratulate you on your patience for explaining 10 times the same thing , even though it made sense the first time . 
  i learned something thanks to you , have an upvote . 
  no worries  i am getting agitated at this stage i wo n't lie , but shouting or swearing or calling people idiots is n't a solution to any situation . 
  well , other than donald trump trying to grab elizabeth 's hand . 
  that 'd make him an idiot . 
  well it 's a tiny bit more than alphabetical , but essentially yes . 
  that 's why , for the 18th time here , i 'm repeating '' * in diplomatic protocol * '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diplomatic_rank https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/head_of_state https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_heads_of_state_by_diplomatic_precedence oh look , she 's at the top !, 
  who 'd have thought 10 seconds of googling could answer you ? 
  ... yup . 
  her health and longevity ? 
  i do n't know her . 
   your comment is very silly lol how would the queen of england outrank the us pres ? 
  they ca n't be ranked against each other https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_heads_of_state_by_diplomatic_precedence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/order_of_precedence nope . 
  das why we got rid of most hereditary peers and now they 're elected . 
  i 've enough issues with a `` royal family '' , do n't get me started on the house of lords ( pre 2000s ) . 
  i 'm left-centrist ( or centrist-left , i guess ) - lib dems , pro eu etc. 
  but i 'm not a `` hippie '' or some `` love everyone and they 'll love you back '' type . 
  i am , well , other than elizabeth , staunchly anti-monarchy . 
  i think the concept of being `` born into '' a role is retarded . 
  and as european history has shown ( pre ww1 ) ... that thinking just leads to war and power hungry in-bred idiots . 
  however ... 
  in spite of all that - and i 'd be open to abolishing the monarchy after her passing - i ... ca n't say a bad word about elizabeth ii . 
  as a ruler / monarch . 
  i ca n't think of a time she did anything `` wrong '' . 
  perhaps a bit `` shy '' on the dianna death thing but ... given it was a divorce and all ( and having lived through one as a kid ) i know that shit is n't easy . 
  she 's done a good job . 
  fuck me , we could have had a lot worse . 
  i may not agree with her position or how she/they come about it - in fact i am against it - but ... lizzy has done us well . 
  she saw us through ww2 , the cold war ... flippin ... what , 9 , 10 prime ministers ? 
  10 presidents ? 
  she knows her shit . 
  well , yelling and swearing wo n't help anyone tbh . 
  and all this was over `` who shakes who 's hand ? 
  she keeps dogs , not cats . 
  he can try to grab one of her dogs , but being corgies and yappy little fucks they 'll probably nip his hand . 
  maybe even sky news might report something of value that day  <, 
   and she also does n't outrank the us president in a diplomatic sense , either . 
  the us is more powerful so their head of state `` outranks '' every other head of state diplomatically . 
  period , you moron . 
  that 's ... not how titles work . 
  if you 'd like me to be more specific , i 'm happy to , but you 're confusing power with stature here . 
   the queen does n't `` outrank '' the us president as we do n't have a system of royalty you have a system of diplomacy . 
  she outranks him in that system  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_heads_of_state_by_diplomatic_precedence, 
  ^ i agree 110 % i 'm not a royalist or monarchist . 
  i 'm a republican ( uk wise that means not having a monarchy , not anything to do with us politics ) in that respect . 
  i agree . 
  * but * , it is what it is . 
  the uk has a queen and monarchy and frankly , i 'm happy with her . 
  near as i can tell she 's not done a step wrong from being thrust into being head of state at 20 ( over the british empire , no less !, 
  this is n't a `` day job '' ) through to helping in factories in ww2 ... she 's done her bit for herself and country . 
  even as a republican i have to admit , she 's done a fucking fine job . 
  charles ? 
  harry ? 
  hot but weird . 
  but lizzy ? 
  she 's been bang on . 
  never a step wrong , never a word out of place . 
  as much as i detest the idea of a `` born through blood '' leadership , fuck me , she 's the best we 've had in 500 years . 
  her majesty queen may knows what she 's doing . 
  through strong and stable leadership , we will rule the world again , in a golden age . 
  if only we could get rid of all the poor people and everyone and everything outside of the m25 orbit , we 'd be set . 
  no , it 's not british , it 's international diplomatic convention . 
  this is n't unique to the uk . 
  this is world wide . 
  it 's an accepted `` standard '' . 
  there 's no flippin ... * law * that says all this . 
  it 's `` diplomatic protocol '' . 
  the only reason `` the british '' are involved here is because we 're talking about president trump having an official state visit ( extended by prime minister may earlier this year ) to trump to visit the uk . 
  he 'd have the same thing if he went to japan or if he went to the netherlands * . 
  \\* i 'm not 100 % on that one . 
  here was the last major one the us might recognise : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnrxgrfjddy they fucked that up , too . 
   so that 's the protocol when the american president is in england then ? 
  i could understand that . 
  but i do n't get why non-british heads of state would be required to follow that protocol if they met the queen in their home country or in a neutral territory . 
  they do n't . 
  if someone else is hosting it , the host comes first , then ... the diplomatic ranks . 
  :-)  i mean at this point i understand why you 'd hold the queen 's hand because she 's an elderly lady and piece of history that deserves respect wherever she is . 
  but if prince charles becomes king and the meeting is n't in britain , i see no reason to follow british protocol . 
  if it was n't in the uk , the head of state would not be extending their hand like that . 
  they 'd meet like normal . 
  however , they 'd meet in order of their diplomatic rank . 
  [ host head of state ]  empress / emperor head of state  king / queen head of state  prince head of state  crown prince / potus / prime minister etc or whatever it is ( sorry that 's not exact ) . 
  to re-wind a few posts , the original question ( `` i 'd love to see trump meet the queen '' ) ... it 'll be in the uk - we 're hosting him . 
  so we extend the hand - he takes it . 
  or he grabs it and tries to yank her arm off , i do n't know :p, 
   i think directly murdering your queen would be the utmost nobelst and honourest of reasons the uk could go to war for . 
  well op said a broken wrist .
