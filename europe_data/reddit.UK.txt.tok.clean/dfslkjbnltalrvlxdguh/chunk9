  if trump out-right tried to murder her ( wtf world are we in ? 
  he 's nuts but not that nuts ) i 'd assume the armed guards would shoot him , if it 's on uk soil . 
  and then we have a fire fight between the royal guards and mi5 , and the secret service . 
  and i presume since potus murdered the queen in cold blood , and potus was shot on uk soil , we may have a few quibbles on the next trade agreement . 
  pence gets put in power ( then later deposed for being a russian infiltrator ) and king charles iii takes the throne . 
  in that situation , i hope obama comes back for term 3 . 
   yeah , but see , we ( usa ) are not part of monarchy anymore . 
  saying that the queen outranks the potus in anyway is wrong , the same goes for the other way around . 
  * diplomatically * like ... at a state ball or banquet - she will get called before him . 
  * unless * it 's hosted in the usa . 
  then him before her . 
  queen liz has no , absolutely * no * power over the potus . 
  none . 
  none whatsoever . 
  but it so totally did explain the structure . 
  are you confusing power with stature ? 
  you 're confusing power with stature . 
  she can . 
  she has the uk armed forces sworn to her command . 
  not the state , not the uk - they swear to her . 
  * technically * ... yes , she can declare war . 
  she 's our head of state - she out-ranks everyone . 
  how easy would it be ? 
  um ... impossible :p but all that aside , this is , for the 10th time , * diplomatic ranks * . 
  the day queen elizabeth ii and kim jung un have a state banquet in each other 's company - yes , lizzy comes first . 
  however that day will never come . 
  do n't confuse `` power '' with `` stature '' . 
  potus is more `` powerful '' than a head of state queen , yes . 
  he or she does not outrank head of state queen , though . 
  diplomatically . 
   i do n't get how the head of state from one country can outrank a head of state from another country . 
  i get she 's the queen and all and she 's old , so obviously you would n't wan na shake hard , but she 's not god . 
  heh , you misunderstand me . 
  i 'm not a royalist - i 'm actually a republican in that respect . 
  remember this is * diplomatic protocol * . 
  there 's no official world-wide `` rank '' . 
  it 's just some internationally agreed set of standards . 
  this * only pertains * to who sits where at a big dinner ( state banquet ) or who signs a treaty document first . 
  that 's all . 
  she has no power over potus ( or anyone else ) . 
  and to circle back , the way a head of state queen or king is met , is by them extending their hand , and the recipient taking it . 
  there 's no shake , there 's no grabbing . 
  it 's just holding hands . 
  this is where i think trump might cmoe undone . 
  i think he 'll try to shake her hand and that 's a `` no no '' . 
  if you want to see a funny `` ooops '' then here 's obama accidentally trying to say a speech when he 's not meant to : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnrxgrfjddy it was funny as fuck , but the uk likes obama , and so no one minded . 
  for anyone unaware - the protocol is you toast after the national anthem , not before and not during  < bless  <, 
  i thought your comment was a joke . 
  in seriousness , i 'd have to say nk is an anomaly . 
  did n't he burst forth from a rainbow of unicorns or something ? 
  in any case : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_kim_jong-il%27s_titles he 's neither a king nor an emperor . 
  diplomatically she out-ranks him . 
  i do n't think we 'll be putting it to the test , though . 
   i should clarify , your last statement is completely untrue . 
  `` queen elizabeth outranks potus '' it 's untrue if you cut out half the sentence / context . 
  she out ranks him in * diplomatic protocol * . 
  so to circle this round to the handshake - in the instance of trump and elizabeth meeting - she should extend her hand and he should hold it . 
  he is not meant to `` shake '' her hand . 
  she 's not offering a partnership , she 's offering her hand for him to follow . 
  it 's a centuries old ( and archaic , if i 'm honest ) tradition . 
  again , this is for diplomatic functions ( who gets called first , who sits first , who is introduced first etc ) , this is not a suggestion that lizzy can `` order '' potus to do anything . 
  she has no command over him whatsoever . 
  she does out rank him , though . 
   so where in there does it say a queen in uk , outranks a president in us ? 
  it does n't say `` a queen in the uk outranks a president in us '' . 
  it 's degrees of rank combined with head of state . 
  both elizabeth and trump are heads of state . 
  on that they 're equal . 
  just that , according to tradition , `` queen [ hos ] '' out ranks president [ hos ] . 
  it 's why prince phillip ( her husband ) is n't a king . 
  essentially - small print . 
  there is no queen of britain :p, 
   i 'm sorry for my ignorance but how can someone from a different country `` outrank '' another country 's president in diplomatic functions . 
  obviously queen elizabeth ca n't tell potus what to do and no one in the usa has any reason to take orders from her . 
  it 's not a `` military '' type rank or hierarchy . 
  it 's a diplimatic one . 
  for example , prince is lower than king , right ? 
  you can have countries where the head of state is a prince . 
  their friends , country b , have a king but the king is not head of state , the prime minister is . 
  in that instance , the prince out-ranks the prime minister who can technically ( if abroad ) outrank the king . 
  it is sooooooooo convoluted and steeped in 200-300 years of european traditions - given we had so many countries with kings , queens , princes , princesses , `` head of state '' ( like oliver cromwell ) ... so they devised this `` diplomatic ranking '' . 
  the only time it really applies at all is : 1 ) in a banquet - a state banquet - people are seated and called to their table by their rank and titles . 
  head of state emperor will be called before head of state queen , who is called after head of state king , but before head of state president . 
  president and prime minister are similar in rank but president out-ranks prime minister . 
  * unless * and we go into reverse now - the host country ( hosting the treaty / banquet / etc ) is present , then their leader may be first or second and . . 
  it 's a can of worms  like ... crown prince will out-rank prince but , but crown prince wo n't outrank prince head of state , but crown prince will be out-ranked by queen if she 's head of state but not if she 's married to a king who is head of state ... unless her partner is not a head of state , then the queen is ( see queen elizabeth and prince phillip ) . 
  or : 2 ) treaty signing - who gets to `` sign first '' etc. 
  see above stupid rules . 
  the books on this can be 500 pages long . 
  that 's entirely possible :d, 
  well that 's my point :p it 'll be interesting to see how he attempts this . 
  a queen who is head of state outranks the president of the united states , yes . 
  am i stupid ? 
  i hope not !, 
  also `` with no power '' ? 
  um , well admittedly our military is smaller than the us 's but she commands it . 
  and whilst the us military swear allegiance to the constitution , our armed forced swear to her . 
  the entire military of the uk is every so technically under her personal command . 
  she signs all laws into place . 
  she can dissolve parliament and take over at any point ( technically ) .
