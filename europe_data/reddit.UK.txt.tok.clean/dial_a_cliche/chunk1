  i 've heard this somewhere before : why bother mechanising when you can mexicanise instead ? 
  is it though ? 
  another way to read this would be more = more support for this type of living arrangement .

  they 're great - being able to board in 3 locations certainly helps , and it 's nice to have a conductor in the bus . 
  but their ac is really weak and loud , so on a hot day the upper deck is a horrible place to be .

   georgian president ( saakasvili , was n't it ) thought nato got his back . 
  it did n't . 
  this amazed me at the time . 
  how could he think the west would get into a fight with russia over georgia ? 
  was this just wishful thinking or was there any basis for it ? 
   ilya ehrenburg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilya_ehrenburg#world_war_ii, 
  i do n't get it - the gps and galileo are going to be interoperable for greater accuracy - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galileo_gps#gps_and_galileo - what 's bad about this ? 
  i think it would be pretty tough if neither person in the couple speaks the local language .

  also , good luck at the christmas market !, 
  could a person really function in germany without being able to speak german ?

  a great thing to do is drive through the mountains from north to south . 
  spend the day exploring the villages and sites in the gorges and then go down to one of the beaches on the south coast for the afternoon . 
  food everywhere is amazing and everyone is very friendly . 
  back when crete was owned by venice . 
  yet,
