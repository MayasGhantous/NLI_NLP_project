i do not . 
  as someone hoping to work in europe at some point over the next 10 or so years , yes . 
  i 'm quite worried . 
  i 'm already looking into other passports/citizenships . 
  it 's not the jewel in the crown of scottish towns , but it 's heartwarming to hear how much it means to the refugees to be somewhere their lives are n't in danger . 
  at some point they 'll meet someone who is n't nice , or is n't able to understand how much we need to do this in the west , but i hope they realise the majority of scotland welcomes them . 
  centralisation of service in a small country can make sense in many cases . 
  i 'm not going to argue the implementation is perfect , but the theory is n't a bad one . 
  local service are n't cheap , and centralisation of them seems like a good way to cut costs . 
  ( i 'm not completely sold on every part of the idea ) . 
  i agree that fire , rescue and police make more sense centralised if done correctly . 
  this does n't have to be done in edinburgh/holyrood . 
  i do n't think the snp are trying to take the policy and rescue service , or the nhs . 
  this type of centralisation is part of the low funded world we now live in . 
  centralisation certainly is n't a dirty word , as long as democracy itself remains ( wind turbines are an exception really as nationally we need to aim for the green goals we 've set ) , so yeah , i pretty much agree with everything you 've said . .  snp want to centralise everything in edinburgh/holyrood and see the eu become a superstate that overrides national sovereignty they are cost saving where they can be bringing services that make sense to a central place . 
  not politicising them for the snp ( from what i can see ) , and i have n't seen anything suggesting they want the eu to be a superstate that overrides national sovereignty . . 
   snp want to centralise everything in edinburgh/holyrood and see the eu become a superstate that overrides national sovereignty you got a source on that ? 
  i do n't think scotland has a particularly strong representation at eu level right now . 
  i 'd like to see us as a small independant nation , working with others small nations ( iceland , denmark , etc. . ) to help boost our votes . 
  its more important for a small independant country to be part of a larger free trade/movement block , than it is about losing your political independence to that larger block . 
  the snp want more power locally , while improving scotland 's representation at the larger table . 
  both these goals could be seen as gaining power locally , and improving the democratic process for the people within scotland . 
  it might well end up making turkey look like part of the problem rather than the rus-fra solution . 
  [ does n't really resemble anything ] ( http://isis.liveuamap.com/ ) . 
  maybe an inverted island nation ? 
  or lots of [ croatia ] ( http://www.visit-croatia.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/croatia_map1.jpg ) stuck together ? 
  you can flat it up with on wikipedia if you think it 's an error , if you 've downloaded the stats and checked them . 
  i 'm afraid i 'm on my mobile at the moment and ca n't download it all myself . 
  i 'm trusting the citation on wikipedia . 
  if you want to download the un data and check it , i 'm happy to change my figures . 
  turn out of registered voters . 
  not all eligible voters are registered . 
  ( sources are [ electoral commission ] ( http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/upcoming-elections-and-referendums/eu-referendum/electorate-and-count-information ) & [ the un ] ( https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/ ) ( for the voting age population stat ), 
   population who could vote 5 year olds are n't part of the population who could vote . . 
  and this is why it ca n't happen, 
  the bus idea is n't all that bad . . 
  we can dream , but the press in the uk is ** very ** powerful . 
  they are n't going to support it , and will make sure they throw everything against it , like last time . 
  they 'll lie , cheat , and basically do anything they think will convince . 
  so either you take the high ground and stick to the truth , or lower yourself to their level . 
  trying the former lost it for us last time , and i do n't want to go down the latter path . 
  i posted this the other day to show how many of us actually voted to leave : # -- 33.9 % of the population who could vote , voted to leave . 
  31.4 % of the population who could vote , voted remain . 
  65.4 % of the population who could vote , voted in the referendum . 
  -- summary : out of the population of the uk who could vote , ** 34m people did n't vote to leave , 17.4 m did ** . 
  for the sake of the eu , i agree , but i ca n't help hoping there is some way around it for my sake and my ( potential ) children 's sake . 
   country full of spiteful bigots . 
  we are n't full of spiteful bigots , we 've just got a lot of them . 
  plenty normal people too !, 
  just to be clear , these views are from a minority . 
  i live and work in england , and the vast majority of people i meet are great . 
  the internet of course brings out the worst . 
  completely agree , just sad it has to be one or the other, 
  this is far to good to be true . 
  some choice comments from other subreddits : / r/worldnews :  why does n't the queen just lay down the law and put her scottish subjects in their place ? 
  / r/ukpolitics  does nicola think shes a big player or something ? 
  you are leader of some shithole thats part of the uk no-one really cares about scotland and wont if you leave . 
  #  devolution has been a catastrophe for the union . 
  scrap the parliaments and assemblies and re establish power in the london parliament . 
  or boot the scots out of the union , the dickheads . 
  / r/unitedkingdom  no more free methadone prescriptions soon . 
  no doubt more incoming . 
  i 'm not even going to look at the bbc comments . . edit : new ones, 
  i feel sorry for your sister . 
  i will be contacting my mp to find out how they plan to vote . 
  or for some to rebel . 
  which happens , and is n't completely unlikely . 
  imagine a scenario where the `` whip '' ( party instruction ) said vote to approve a50 , yet the mps constituents voted remain , and a major employer would leave the area , losing thousands of jobs . 
  the mp would be in a tricky position . . 
  some will , just not enough . 
  if their constituents voted to stay you would expect them to vote against a50, 
  very likely they 'll accept it . 
  mps voting against it would 1 ) have to defy their party as the tories will whip ( tell them how to vote ) 2 ) vote against their constituents who elected them . 
  edit : words, 
  to be fair i think that only applies inside the city walls , so we are still free to visit the national rail museum . 
  it 's the most impressive building in this imagine buy some distance . 
  \u2191 \u2191 \u2191 and there you go folks, 
  as a mate ( eu citizen working professional high paid job ) said , `` why the fuck would i want to pay tax into a non eu country that is n't supporting the rest of the eu and my home country ? 
  i 'm going somewhere that actually values me . '', 
  did n't have them in scottish referendum either . 
  because the terrorists might see sweden as being accepting of muslim refugees , so by doing this they 'll stir up right wing hate of them , and then help to potentially radicalise some of the refugees . 
  yup , i can see others missing in scotland too . 
  article 3 :  the abolition , as between member states , of obstacles to freedom of movement for persons , services and capital ;, 
  they will do something . 
  they just ca n't decide what . 
  oh yeah , it would screw everything up . 
  the video mainly talks about the protection of the gfa , so his comments cover a range of things . 
  the deal with the dup putting it all in question . 
  this is old news , from the 19th . 
  but : 1 . 
  i 'd not seen it before 2 . 
  he 's saying that ireland would block any brexit deal if the uk conservatives do a deal with the dup, 
  i do n't see what hillary clinton has to do with anything . 
  billionaires and millionaires have so much more than the poorest , it does n't seem to make much sense to differentiate . 
  if someone can not afford to feed their family , being able to afford a # 1m home or a # 20m with staff does n't really make a lot of difference . 
  you can call her what you want , but to me she is totally loaded . 
  she lives in a different economic realm . 
  she will never worry about electricity bills , or overdrafts , or the cost of food . 
  she is totally loaded by my definition . 
  it 's totally subjective .
