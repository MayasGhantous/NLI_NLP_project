  i 'm not arguing one way or the other on the norway deal , or on any deal in particular , as i 'm more than likely going to be voting to stay . 
  i 'm pointing out that there 's northern european states outside the eu that exhibit a high quality of life without having masses of oil , namely iceland . 
  further , based on recent polling , the eu is at serious risk of losing the entirety of northern europe . 
  there 's serious disenfranchisement within the northern part of the bloc that is n't going to disappear by carrying on with business as usual . 
  i imagine the referendum question would be something like : `` do you agree with southern european nations , such as france , that the eu should impose a tobin tax on financial trades that will particularly harm london due to the size of its financial sector , meaning 90 % of all tax generated by the scheme will be generated by the uk . 
  this same tax caused the majority of swedish trading activity to switch to using london as a base when they implemented it in the 1990s . '', 
  actually , make my predicted result 97 % against . 
  incidentally , cleaning the toilets of london law firms does n't mean you work in `` international law '' . 
  pretty sure if it was put to a referendum it would be voted against by 90 % or more of the uk population . 
  nice try though . 
  and iceland ? 
  looking around northern europe does n't look good for the pro-eu folk . 
  iceland and norway are out . 
  denmark and sweden are the most euroskeptic countries in the bloc . 
  the uk could leave this year . 
  finland 's economy is a disaster zone due to the euro and a lack of competitiveness . 
  the largest single party in the netherlands at the moment based on polling also wants to leave the eu . 
  the only country that is unquestionably pro-eu is ireland who is a net beneficiary of funds from the rest of the bloc that nevertheless could be pulled out by any ham fisted handling of a brexit . 
  after three months do eu migrants in germany gain access to the full welfare system , or are they kept on a lower rate due to the german system 's contributory nature ? 
  hmm , not sure about some of these . 
  the crescentine picture is definitely wrong . 
  i 'm thinking of [ these things ] ( http://d6ka0on10obqx.cloudfront.net/default_filter_crop/uploads/geo/province/00000015/images/crescentine-fritte.jpg ) which are a type of deep fried unleavened bread which puff up into a hollow ball , and are normally served still warm with [ squacquerone cheese ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8526/8617421385_3179edac8a_b.jpg ) , a soft fresh cheese , and mortadella and parma ham . 
  similarly , pasatelli in brodo looks more like [ this ] ( http://www.ciaochef.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/f_passatelli-in-brodo.jpg ) than your picture .

  that enough ? 
  in peterborough there 's been at least two separate trials of different gangs within the past few years that i know of . 
  why would anybody care about the current deal if the uk voted to leave ? 
  seems like a particularly pointless position for france and belgium to take . 
  in the north of england we say aye for yes . 
  that reply bears no connection to my post and seems to be three sentences with no connection to each other . 
   i do n't believe the renewed interest is intent on escaping the pound but to hedge against uncertainly in the uks relationship with the second largest trading bloc in the world . 
  again , * what are you talking about * ? 
  the companies that operate the stock exchanges , own the buildings , own the networks , and so on , have merged . 
  that 's all . 
  the london stock exchange and the german stock exchange are not merging into one market . 
  the companies that actually own these exchanges are merging . 
  `` escaping the pound '' and `` hedging against uncertainty in the uks relationship with the second largest trading bloc in the world '' just do n't even make sense in this context . 
  what 's the deal with you posting unsubstantiated crap in every brexit thread ? 
  yesterday you claimed cameron was trying to set up an alternative northern european version of the eu , which when pushed you could n't actually back up with a cite . 
  in reality , it seems that you were referring to the northern futures forum , an intergovernmental meeting of northern european heads of state , similar to the visegrad 4 meetings , or the nordic council . 
  the day before that you were trying to claim that the london metals exchange will up and move to belgium ( ? 
  ) , stop trading in pounds and start trading in euros , despite the exchange trading in us dollars . 
  now you 're trying to imply the company that operates the london stock exchange has merged with deutsche borse due to a weak pound . 
  virtually every thread on this subject has you shitposting in it , stringing together words into sentences that sound plausible but in reality have no meaning . 
   i doubt the reaction would be that hostile ( or hostile at all ) . 
  only problem i see is that you do n't have the weight when it comes to renegotiating agreements post-eu that the uk has for this reason , if the uk does vote to leave , is it better for a wavering country to leave immediately with the uk and negotiate together , or better to wait to see how the uk does outside of the eu before jumping ? 
  yeah , the recent debate hsbc had over their hq should be instructive . 
  not a single city other than london was considered in europe . 
  even with the possibility of the uk leaving the eu they still remained in london . 
  two relatively small companies have merged . 
  i think you are reading too much into this . 
  britain will just abolish corporation tax altogether if companies start to leave . 
  not sure why there 's an unspoken assumption that britain just sits back and does nothing in this situation in all of these threads . 
  the question is redundant as cameron has , at least to my knowledge , never actually proposed any such thing . 
  read the supposed `` cite '' collectiveindividual provided above and there 's no mention of this supposed uk/nordic/baltic area . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the article provided does n't mention anything about a `` uk/nordic/baltic area '' , and certainly not from cameron . 
  it 's talking about nordic heads of state warning cameron about trying to pursue an immigration `` emergency brake '' . 
   not that they 've even tried to fight further integration as much as the uk anyway . 
  why would they when the uk does it anyway ? 
   cameron in his previous term was floating the notion of a north europe bloc separate from the eu ( with the uk being the centre ) . 
  what ? 
  eta : actually found what you 're talking about , which is the northern future forum , an annual meeting of heads of state from northern europe similar to the v4 , nordic council , and sarkozy 's proposed mediterranean union , supposed to build an alliance of northern european states , described by dagens nyheter as : `` behind the scenes , this `` northern alliance '' will also debate ways to frustrate a `` french model '' for the european economy . '', 
  nothing to do with forming a separate bloc from the eu , and you know , exactly the sort of thing europhiles are always whining about the uk not doing enough of . 
  then you can replace one set of veto-happy anglo saxons with another !, 
   a region that has barely the population of romania will cause the same exact effect that the entire east europe did . 
  it does n't need to have the same effect for it to be a problem as it 's just adding further to an existing phenomenon . 
  the bottom end of our labour market is still feeling the effects of the eastern european expansion and probably will for some time to come until eastern european living standards catch up . 
  why add another 20 million people , even poorer than eastern europe , on top ? 
  kosovo has a gdp per capita four times smaller than the gdp per capita of estonia !, 
   when the eastern countries got in they did n't have the same living standards of existing members . 
  yeah , and a massive flare up in euroskeptic feeling in the uk was the response as the bottom end of our labour market was undercut by cheap labour from the east of europe . 
  i see no reason to repeat that . 
  for some on that list , perhaps in decades when they have met the average living standard of existing members , are free from corruption , and so on . 
  i do n't see any advantage whatsoever in including these countries before that reform process has taken place , outside of the eu , not within it . 
  further , i think there 's already far too many small countries within the eu that have a disproportionately large voice compared to their population , size of economy , and benefits their membership brings to the rest of the union . 
  i do n't really see what advantage would accrue to the populations of existing members in the north and west of the bloc , and foresee many disadvantages , if we allow entry to a million tiny nations in the balkans , artificially inflating the importance of that part of europe . 
  the eu 's `` every country is equal '' idea is already contentious enough without pouring fuel on the fire by admitting a clutch of small , largely poor , largely culturally similar countries * en masse * . 
  the pound 's value has been inflated over the last twelve months by speculators banking on an interest rate rise . 
  it weakening a bit is n't the disaster / r/europe seems convinced it is . 
  [ royal marines ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkfknsdfozw ) . 
  cameron 's crappy deal has pushed more people into leaving than remaining , from what i can see . 
  what we asked for : a single market in services , streamlining bureaucracy in the eu to make business easier , a guarantee that britain will not be unfairly disadvantaged by not using the euro , and some other fluff . 
  what was actually negotiated : less than nothing . 
  the whole thing has just given a boost to the `` leave '' side who have been claiming meaningful reform of the eu is impossible for years . 
  in one swoop , their claims have been validated . 
  christ , if we ca n't even negotiate a deepening of the eu 's internal market by creating a proper single market for services , what can we agree on ? 
  because oil income is n't sufficient to cover scotland 's outlays . 
  they have an older , less healthy , more violent , more geographically dispersed population than england , and it all costs . 
  as a percentage of the total workforce , there 's more public sector workers in scotland than in england too . 
  further , various public and semi-private organisations , like the student loans company , are based in scotland despite largely serving the english and welsh . 
  what industry they do have outside of oil , like shipbuilding and finance , is supported by the rest of the uk , which orders a large percentage of royal navy ships from scottish shipbuilders to the detriment of shipyards in the rest of the uk , and provides the vast majority of the customer base for scottish pension funds . 
  as a result , public spending per capita is higher in scotland than in england , which receives the least public spending of anywhere in the uk . 
  the only reason why they are in the uk in the first place was because they wanted subsidising after completely fucking up their economy starting a colony in the middle of a swamp on the other side of the world . 
  they 've had 300 years of subsidy and riding the coattails of the english from the poorest nation in western europe to the top of the world , so yeah , bring on another referendum -- the only winners will be the rest of the uk when we 're finally free from their gigantic victim complex , have to stop sending money north , and are released from any obligation requiring us to spend billions winding down the nearly empty oil fields . 
  the actual article says less than one third of firms surveyed will consider downsizing or leaving , not that one third of firms will leave . 
  i think it 's time this subreddit started filtering guardian articles . 
  the thrust of this article 's headline is clearly contradicted by the opening paragraph of the article itself .
