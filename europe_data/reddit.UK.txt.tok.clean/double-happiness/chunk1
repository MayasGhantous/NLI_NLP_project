do n't forget edinburgh !, 
  [ here 's a no . 
  25 ] ( http://www.onlyinedinburgh.com/images/lothian_buses.jpg ) , i used to take that bus to college every morning . 
  the great thing about buses in embra is that the red ones ( lothian buses ) do n't run from a station , they all either go from point a to point b , or in circular routes , so you can go from anywhere to pretty much anywhere else without having to change buses . 
  some of those circular routes are massive too , you can take some that go right round the city and take about 1\u00a01/2 hours to complete the route . 
  why do n't you just make your point of view known instead of doling out the sarcasm ? 
  i 'm actually finding it a bit hard to work out what your actual message is because it is obscured by so much hyperbole . 
  we 're still kind of avoiding each other , tbh . 
   the british love to talk weather on that topic , i had an embarrasing and awkward experience recently when i happened to remark to a fellow plot-holder at my allotments how fine the weather was , * just as * he was remarking to me that he thought the meteorological conditions were inclement . 
  really quite a tense situation , we both grinned abashedly , and hurried about our business . 
  if this video is on the topic of gender politics , you might want to cross-post it to my subreddit / r/gendervideos / . 
  a lot of likes on the youtube video and some enthusiastic comments there too . 
  i shall have to try and check this out later . 
  might be worth mentioning that there 's a somewhat nsfl photo of a dead child from a related story at the bottom of that page , be warned . 
  you 're not really helping my understanding with that reply !, 
  it 's still a minority of men that commit crime . 
  i do n't have exact figures on hand , but a quick look at some sources suggest that perhaps around 1/3 of uk or us men have a criminal or at least police record . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/apr/14/workandcareers.observercashsection http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-many-americans-have-a-police-record-probably-more-than-you-think-1438939802 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/business/out-of-trouble-but-criminal-records-keep-men-out-of-work.html, 
   books and cds and stuff yeah , most of the items sold on amazon , in other words !, 
  books , cds , video , dvd , video games , electronics & photo , kindle accessories , home & garden , software and toys all have fixed shipping credits . 
  anything * else * you can set your own shipping cost for , i guess . 
  -_- http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeid=3149231, 
  amazon 's shipping credit is often so low it 's not worthwhile for third-party sellers to ship internationally when selling through amazon . 
  of course , you could do it by hiking up your prices to make up the shortfall , but that would make your items much less competitive . 
  also , shipping costs for returns could well be an issue , as amazon buyers rarely pay much attention to descriptions ( i call it ` click first , ask questions later ' ) . 
   ... livestock -- often a cow and a couple of sheep -- were brought indoors , a smart , if smelly , way to keep the house warm . 
  as well as using the animals ' body heat , the st kildans would spread the animals ' manure -- along with their own waste , including both excrement and discarded bird carcasses -- over the floor .

   even on a low wage job in the uk you can afford to travel to europe at least once a year !, 
  well that depends on your other expenses and financial obligations in life , does n't it ? 
   this guy is just attributing the exchange rate as the sole reason he ca n't go on holiday i was n't attributing the exchange rate as the sole reason i ca n't go on holiday at all . 
  like i said above , my chances of taking a holiday abroad were already low to begin with , the exchange rate situation has just made a low chance into no chance . 
   he 's either just saying that to push his political agenda no idea what you 're on about there , i was simply sounding off about how hard it is for me to get a holiday . 
   or he is lazy as fuck to put it bluntly if you knew me personally i seriously doubt you would say that . 
  does [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/vcnuy ) strike you as the achievements of someone who is lazy ? 
  i was even [ called a scumbag ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uwpftxq.jpg ) itt for having the temerity to shoot off steam about the fact i can hardly afford a holiday at all , much less now . 
  it 's just a simple fact that my chances of a holiday abroad are generally low , but with the exchange rate the way it is , the chances are zero , i 'm not even thinking about it right now . 
  simple as that . 
  yeah that sounds like a good idea , i think i would like it there . 
  my last gf was from ukraine actually . 
  thanks for the suggestion . 
  that shopska salad looks well tasty , must try that . 
  i would have liked to finally take a holiday abroad after all this time , but this exchange rate makes an unlikely event into one that absolutely is n't going to happen . 
  my annual income is only in 4 figures so i am certainly more sensitive to exchange rates than most people . 
  my chances of a holiday in general : not much my chances of a holiday abroad : low my chances of a holiday abroad right now : zero, 
  yeah , but i have n't been out of the country since 1998 , so it would have been nice for a change . 
  i was even talking to a guy i know from the web about going to visit him in germany , but it would be expensive right now so there 's no chance . 
  there would n't have been much to begin with like i say , but there is none now . 
  there 's no chance of me visiting continental europe with this weak pound . 
  it would be difficult for me to get a holiday anyway , but as things stand it would have to be in the uk . 
  not read the article yet , but my first guess is that it 's because we do n't really trust our government to solve social problems , hence our willingness to address them through charity . 
  just a theory ... 
  brigaded from where ? 
  other subreddits or from different sites altogether ? 
  you specifically mentioned ` outsiders ' so i take it you must mean one or the other , as opposed to redditors who actually subscribe to or regularly visit / r/europe / . 
  fwiw , this has already been submitted [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/58o6v8/budapest_60_years_after_the_uprising_compare_the/ ) . 
   hell currently has ... a retirement home . 
  oof , i do n't want to end up there . 
  fwiw , i think it 's better shown [ using shading ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/files/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-13-at-11.04.01.png ) . 
  you get a more detailed picture that way , because you can see the percentage vote for each borough . 
  point taken , anyway . 
  lol !, 
   we 're very similar people in almost every regard england and scotland are not so similar [ politically ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/2015328_woc002_0.png?1427218824 ) . 
  i see , thanks . 
   i wonder how these people would feel to be legally ` castrated ' how are you legally ` castrated ' ? 
  you could have a child with a man any time you wanted , could n't you ? 
   there is technology that allows me to have kids , yet i 'm not allowed to make use of it how is that exactly ? 
  what 's stopping you ? 
  by the way , i 'm a former sperm donor for heterosexual couples , but i would never do it for a lesbian couple , and i 've been asked . 
  just you said `` what 's the ffing difference ? '' . 
  ...  they also believe that you 'll infect the kids with the gay i know you did n't say that , but it is total bullshit , afaic . 
  my reasons for my views on ivf for lesbian women are nothing to do with this . 
  i am 100 % accepting of homosexuality , in itself . 
  i think a child does n't * need * a mother and father , but , ( other things being equal ) , a child * is better off with * a mother and father . 
   one publication from a far-left blog ( ? ), 
  he actually quotes his own facebook post . 
  that 's some quality writing / s, 
  from the linked article :  all over the world , big cities are facing the same dilemma : how to provide enough affordable housing for all their citizens . 
  a wealthy metropolis can not just be a playground for investment bankers . 
  it also needs nurses , teachers , and policemen who can live within easy reach of their workplaces . 
   most public housing in europe turns into ghettoes . 
  council estates in britain i would n't really describe the average british council estate as a ghetto . 
  rather cheap and low-quality building sometimes yes , but not usually a ghetto ime . 
  these are all important matters to consider , and i do appreciate you clarifying , even though i am pro-independence . 
  the other side of the coin is , what 's the value of no more tory government for scotland ? 
  we could save [ # 163 million a year ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-independence-trident-costs-taxpayers-in-scotland-m-a-day-says-alex-salmond-1-2610802 ) scrapping trident , for one thing . 
  how about [ tablet ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=tablet+scottish&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=941&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewjy7qhtnudpahxla8akhehebmeq_auibygc ) . 
  oof , after i explained all that !, 
  oh well , you ca n't fault me for trying , i guess !, 
  right , i see now !, 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  i 'm a bit slow at grasping these things sometimes . 
   mushroom growers rely on the uk for 80pc of sales and have been losing money since britain 's vote to quit the european union in june sent sterling tumbling . 
  it has now lost 19pc of its value against the euro , wiping out the irish producers ' profit margins . 
  why has gbp losing 19 % of its value against the $ wiped out the irish producers ' profit margins ? 
  i do n't understand this . 
  are n't the irish producers ' mushrooms priced and paid for in euros ? 
  i find it hard to read the rest of the article when this is left unexplained ; perhaps it 's elementary to economists and others , but not to me . 
  the mainstream dance scene seems like a pile of crap these days ; nobody really gave a shit about the dj circa 1987-93 , in my experience . 
  shit , half the time in clubs i could n't even see the dj , because there was too much fucking dry ice !,
