  romania seems quite similar to switzerland , as far as i can tell . 
   happyness just a small tip for your english is that any ( i think ) adjective ending in - y changes it suffix to - i when it is made into a noun : happy  happiness sunny  sunniness sloppy  sloppiness stealthy  stealthiness hope that helps !, 
  perhaps it was just a typo though . 
   the irony is the anti-indy people are always leave voters . 
  the attitude is something that is hard to even describe . 
  on the other hand , i know an english couple who live here , they are pretty well-off and own a nice house plus a flat they let out . 
  they said to me , ` what do you think about this [ uk/scotland ] referendum ? ', 
  they were obviously concerned about it and seemed to see it as anti-english and likely to cause a lot of trouble . 
  then when the second referendum happened , they said to me they thought brexit was a terrible decision . 
  i was like , wtf , what did you expect ? 
  * you 're * the ones that voted for rule from westminster , you know that 's how we end up getting these tory governments ( the couple are both liberal / left-wing ) , how can you be so naive ? 
  it 's hard to think of an analogy , but it 's a bit like giving your car keys to someone you hardly know , then complaining they drove you somewhere you do n't like . 
  ah well , on behalf of my countrymen , that 's kind of you to say so !, 
  having been on the losing side of two referendums , i 'm personally a little jaded with it all , hence my earlier post . 
   i feel spat on and unwelcome how do you think we feel after being saddled with your bullshit tory government for years that we have * never * voted for ? 
  as a scot , i do n't feel unwelcome here at all . 
  i feel continental europeans mostly actually feel pretty sorry for us getting dragged into your stupid xenophobic hate politics . 
   to ensure gender equality it is important in many cases that women and men are treated equally . 
  but they should not necessarily be treated equally in all situations [ ... ] forcing women to do military service to legitimize it is completely untenable . 
  ( i ca n't link the source for that quote because the domain is not allowed in this subreddit for some reason , check my posting history for it . ), 
   it varies a lot from country to country . 
  i would think that 's why cinguli said `` on average '' . 
  that 's the reason people look at data in the form of averages - to take account of variations such as the one your mentioned . 
  imo germany 's real strength is in its white wine , which personally i think is the best in europe , notably riesling and gewurztraminer . 
  thanks for the info . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm still not seeing anything though ; i guess i accepted the new terms and 30 days have passed . 
  or maybe i already opted out and that 's why i ca n't see the option ? 
  oh well , never mind , i 'm not all that bothered really ... 
  i looked , but could not see the option . 
  perhaps i have not been requested to opt in yet , idk . 
  i just tried looking at the whatsapp legal info on my ( android ) phone ; holy mackerel that 's a lot of scrolling !, 
  [ border collie ] ( http://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/gallery/border-collie-dog-breed-pictures/1-facethreequarters.jpg ) . 
  i think they can be a bit temperamental , but they are very hardworking and intelligent dogs . 
  i see . 
  thanks for the explanation , i was a bit puzzled !, 
   the way you asked and linked me to wiki suggests you did a google search for tfios i did . 
   have you ever read it or watched the movie ? 
  i 've not , no . 
  so what 's the link ? 
  are you referring to [ the fault in our stars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_fault_in_our_stars ) ? 
  if so , no . 
  the last pic shows an unlit cigarette ; i do n't think that actually counts as a health hazard !, 
  i like the [ headdresses ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/a8/18/0f/a8180f16da4818caad8a1605d433575e.jpg ) , they 're pretty neat . 
  great post , really enjoyed seeing these pics !, 
  from my experience briefly travelling in china in the late '80s , you want to be careful trying to rob the chinese , you 're in danger of ending up with a vigilante mob coming after you . 
  they really do not like thieves and are quite fearless about chasing them , ime . 
  no , not that i know of . 
  as far as the ` bigoted ' comment goes , i just think they should make more of an attempt to appear neutral . 
  i do not want to know my local bbc radio station presenter 's political views , i just want them to tell me what 's in the news . 
  but like i said , i cancelled my license , so i no longer support them financially . 
  the bias of the bbc is partly why i got rid of my tv ( so i could stop paying the license fee to them ) . 
  i 'm on the left myself , but the left-wing bias is ridiculous . 
  i heard one of the presenters on my local radio describe men 's rights activists as ` pretty bigoted ' , which is hardly the neutral tone i expect . 
  there are far too many opinion pieces for my liking . 
  the guardian does some good pieces on gender issues [ now ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/17/male-circumcision-baby-goodluck ) and [ then ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/19/number-of-suicides-uk-increases-2013-male-rate-highest-2001 ) , but then shoots itself in the foot with rubbish like [ this ] ( http://archive.is/pjmnx ) and [ this ] ( https://archive.is/qpmsp ) . 
  could this be the last we 'll see of [ ` witches ' knickers ' ] ( http://farm1.static.flickr.com/142/379443836_291511d84a.jpg ) ?

   expats are a loss to the country they left depends on the expat in question , does it not ? 
  already posted , i think . 
   homophobia is apparently associated with homosexual arousal that the homophobic individual is either unaware of or denies . 
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8772014 ( ` proven ' is setting a bit of high bar , since there rarely is any proof in social science research . ), 
  dolcelatta is nice for biscuits . 
  i like gruyere or emmenthal in filled rolls . 
  medium-mature uncoloured cheddar for cooking ; goes great in a spinach and cheese omelette . 
  for serving pasta or risotto , parmesan , or pecorino which is usually a bit cheaper ime .

  oh i see , i was concerned it was another terrorist attack in progress . 
  why ` boom ' ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  : confused :, 
   people would go there more i just hope they will continue to offer to let me go ahead of them in the queue , as i usually only have a couple of things . 
  really appreciate it when people do that . 
  just for the record ...  the norwich criminal investigation department say there is no indication that this was a racially motivated attack . 
   `` we are aware of suggestions this may have been a racially motivated incident and whilst there is currently no information to suggest this to be the case we will of course keep an open mind . '', 
  what worries me about how brexit might affect me individually , is i fear euro-based businesses like aldi and lidl could shut up shop , and food prices could rise as migrant workers are driven out of the agricultural sector . 
  [ rusk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rusk ) , for one thing .

  i like it , because that 's the currency the use in * the mighty boosh * . 
  so that we can more easily lean out the window to empty our chamber-pots . 
  mine do something like that , but you have to be a bit careful as if you do it too quickly and with just the wrong movement , almost the entire window will come loose ; it will be just held on by one hinge at one corner , and you have to push the whole window back into place before it falls forwards into your arms . 
  great system otherwise . 
  til . 
  thanks for the info . 
  right , is that how they spell it . 
  my bad , it 's been years since i read it . 
  the irish are big tea drinkers . 
  [ * juno and the paycock * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juno_and_the_paycock ) includes near-constant mentions of cups of ~ ~ ` taay ' ~ ~ ` tae ' as they call it , and i once visited an irish family of catholic background who drank from a massive pot of very darkly stewed tea , complete with loose tealeaves poured straight into the cup !, 
  no messing around with a tea strainer , oh no . 
  just be sure to pack a flamethrower for the midges . 
  really great pics ; [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rywydgh.jpg ) is my favourite .

   so when the country does it to get away from unelected , it 's racist did i say that ?? 
  you 're massively straw-manning there , do n't ascribe that argument to me . 
   we should be independent anyway because the tories lol , as if that 's not a good enough reason on its own !, 
  the tories are * exactly * the reason we should be independent - or more precisely the numerical fact that as a nation outnumbered 10:1 by english voters , if those south of the border choose to vote for the monster raving loony party , that is precisely the government * we * will get . 
  that 's why it 's called ` self rule ' , because we would get to choose our own government instead of having it imposed from outside . 
  personally i suspect a guy ` pouring his heart out ' can tend to make women feel a little anxious , since they expect a man to be strong ( that amy winehouse song puts it well - `` you 're supposed to be stronger than me '' ) . 
  what i find frustrating is when anyone - male or female - starts trying to solve your problems instead of just listening . 
  a good listener is a great person to have around , but it 's a rather rare skill ime .
