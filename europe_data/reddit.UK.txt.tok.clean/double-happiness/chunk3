  in my experience , if anyone has a problem with us talking about our emotions , it tends to be women . 
  they are often the ones who seem to need men to be strong . 
  most especially in a romantic context ; i think often if you show a vulnerable or insecure side it can really count against you , so you need to be kind of stoic . 
   there is no nokia 4 now nor has there ever been as the number is considered unlucky in china til , new one on me . 
  [ drop scones ] ( http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/2548/drop-scones.aspx ) are very nice . 
  i once had a pizza from a takeaway in south wales , with small chunks of potato on it . 
  it was quite nice actually . 
  wow , cheapest so far , i think . 
  of course it 's all relative to income ; still interesting to hear though . 
  nice . 
  i wonder if that is standard for germany , i would n't be surprised . 
  i 've thought about moving there for years , actually . 
  holy crap !, 
  dutch is one of the wierdest languages in europe imo . 
  to me , it sounds like somebody swallowed a bee , or inhaled a cake . 
  seemingly ozzy osbourne used to go round with a shoe on a leash . 
  exactly , and you do n't isolate those problems by generalising the majority . 
  i 'm not an expert but afaik islam has specific creeds / sects such as wahhabism that really cause all the problems . 
  sure , you could argue that mainstream islam is not very good w/r/t to homosexuality and women 's rights , but the same could be said for other religions . 
  the main point to me is that the * average * muslim is not throwing homosexuals from towers , only * extremists * are doing and supporting these acts . 
  on a personal note , my landlord 's family are muslims and they are the nicest people you could wish to meet , they even sent me an xmas card . 
  i once had a muslim couple offer to cook me bacon !!, 
  even though they would not have eaten it themselves ( it 's forbidden in islam , in case you did n't know ) . 
  so let 's not ` tar them all with the same brush ' . 
  if we view them all negatively there will no effective ` reward ' for moderacy or integration . 
  my country 's entire history is practically composed of nothing but tribal warlords , big deal . 
   islam perpetuates a culture of intolerance , very often to the point of violence . 
  big assumption there , all the rest flows out from that . 
  i could just as easily say that the usa perpetuates a culture of intolerance , very often to the point of violence .

   radical muslim antics radical islam 's not relevant at all afaik  millions subscribe to either actively or passively how do they ` subscribe to it passively ' ? 
   a dog-walker chimed in , `` what an interesting conversation you 're having , you 've made such good points , thank you very much , i agree completely ! '' bah , you would never get people talking like that in the uk , shocking . 
   i have n't read it it 's not exactly an easy read . 
   the huge majority of the country is white and , for this reason , any focus on poor school performance is a focus on white poor , our country is n't so diverse that races have to be singled out . 
  well i guess since i 'm from a sociology background i disagree with that ; iirc it was the the sociologist william labov who showed how black ghetto children were getting left behind due to language differences and various other factors , and helped to restructure the classroom environment to aid them . 
  years ago it was bangladeshi and pakistani background kids who needed help , but they have now improved quite a bit afaik . 
  yet now it is white kids who are languishing nobody seems to give a shit and in fact they are lambasted by some as being ` privileged ' , which like i say just plays into the hands of the far right . 
   and i do n't know who ` they ' are ... 
  the ` regressive left ' , people who push identity politics , people like jason osamede okundaye in fact . 
   ... i have n't noticed much pushing of identity politics in the uk mainstream , so i feel like some people are getting a bit carried away when they feel victimised . 
  google ` uk ends # 5.2 m taxpayer support for ethiopian girl band project ' five million quid to a fucking ethiopian girl band ?? 
  that 's a lot of cheddar ; money that could have been far better used to support people from this country . 
  and before you say that was done under a tory government , it 's still a form of ` gender justice ' / aka identity politics imo , and i 've a suspicion that labour might do even more egregious shit like that sadly . 
   i 'm talking about this ` playing into the hand of the far right ' . 
  i did n't say you were a right winger . 
  ah right , you could have explained that better imho . 
  so how did you jump from the `` far right '' to `` conservative government '' , anyway ? 
  i was talking about the likes of the edl , not the tories . 
   i do n't think that there is a need for any identity politics beyond a general class-consciousness identity politics is currently being used to reduce class-consciousness imo . 
  this guy in the op is a bloody privately-educated upper-middle-class son of a civil servant cambridge student , yet he is playing the victim !!, 
  not denying people can be racist against wealthy poc , but the left in this country needs to get back to its roots pronto imo . 
  it 's `` workers of the world unite '' , not these other groups that are taking over the left . 
   i resent any attempt to americanise our political discourse in such a way right , then i assume you 'll be against blm 's move into the uk . 
  this op is exactly part of the same process imo . 
  i quite understand and genuinely sympathise with poc 's frustration with racism in the uk , but claiming ` all white people are racist ' is just divisive , retrograde and could actually be seen as a power play in a lot of ways . 
  anyway i 'm getting a bit fatigued of this exchange so will probably bow out at this stage . 
  nothing personal , but it does n't help that right now i have to pretty much slog my guts out every day to get by , so i do n't have all that much energy for these discussions .

   just because , in general , the discourse does n't single out white people specifically does n't mean that it is n't a pressing concern for people on the left . 
  no , you 're right , they do n't concentrate on white people at all , even though it 's arguably whites who are getting left behind now . 
  in fact they bleat on about so-called `` white privilege '' and the supposed inherent racism of the white population , as evidenced in the op , while masking their own massive privilege , such as matey boy jason osamede okundaye there being a privately-educated son of a civil servant !!, 
   i do n't see how any conservative government can hope to make it better . 
  voting for right wing parties because you 're upset about poor school funding and a lack of social mobility is absolute mental in my opinion . 
  what the fuck are you even talking about mike ?!?!, 
  i 've never voted for a right-wing party in my life , i 'm a fucking snp member !!!!, 
  i used to be in the socialist workers party and involved with the [ militant tendency ] ( http://www.militant.org.uk/ ) back in the '80s , i 'll have you know . 
  see , this is exactly the sort of bullshit people are getting pissed off with !!!, 
  `` oh , you dared to question our identity politics narrative ? 
  guess you must be a tory right-winger then ! '', 
  absolutely classic example of everything that 's wrong with politics in this country . 
  you could n't have exemplified it better . 
   the press often attacks members of the public , often with character attacks on students of colour ... 
  tactics include ... embarrassing or unflattering photographs . 
  unflattering photographs = racism, 
  this stuff surely has a [ chilling effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chilling_effect ) on people 's speech and behaviour . 
  it 's a part of why i am no longer in teaching , for one . 
   ethic minorities idk where you got that from btw .
