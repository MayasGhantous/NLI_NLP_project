  problem is that it does n't work . 
  you ca n't negotiate in public . 
  i 've explained why elsewhere in this thread . 
  perhaps you could answer a simple question for me . 
  i 've asked it a lot and got no answer . 
  the ttip will be available for everyone to read and scrutinise for ages before it is voted on . 
  when it has finished being negotiated . 
  what actually is the problem with that ? 
  why do you want to see an unfinished document that you claim you wo n't understand ** right now ** ? 
  why ca n't you wait until negotiations are over and then take a year scrutinising it ? 
  it might be that you have a misconception that when negotiations are over it will immediately come into force . 
  that is n't true . 
  once negotiations are over , that is when the real work begins . 
  it will be released in full , and we will all be able to read it in detail , probably for years , before our parliaments get a full vote on it . 
  why is that a problem ? 
  ah right , i 'm the ignorant one there in that case . 
  sounds kind of fair , although again i do n't see why they need to given we will all get the full thing miles ahead of it being voted on . 
  so you consult with lots of dealers and see what they say individually . 
  that 's basically a good analogy for what 's happening . 
  if they all have an interest in declaring a high price then the buyer is n't going to listen to them and wo n't accept what they say . 
  again i do n't see the issue ? 
  ok , let 's get on to isds then . 
  i 've discussed the main points on tpp 's system [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/tradeissues/comments/3rnbkf/a_first_analysis_of_the_dispute_resolution/ ) ttip 's is shaping up to be even more transparent and to establish a transatlantic court of arbitration , which would be a great step . 
  i discussed isds generally [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/3ew00o/rosia_montana_an_omen_for_ttip_romanians_decided/ctjc7sb ) and in the ensuing comment chain , which dealt with most of the common objections . 
  now , to deal with you points specifically :  expose the us claim culture to other countries with a new biased legal arbitration system ( isds ) , why is that necessary ? 
  we already have hundreds of bits that contain isds arbitration clauses . 
  it 's not a new thing . 
  isds is also unbiased . 
  each party selects an arbitrator , and either can object to the other 's choice if there is a shred of evidence to demonstrate bias . 
  those two objective arbitrators choose the chairman between them . 
   the elected eu officials had limited time to study copies of this treaty in a sealed room , they were not allowed to copy or reproduce it , but yeah for ` transparency ' . 
  yes and we will all have time to study the actual text for ages before it is finalised . 
  i do n't see the issue ? 
  tpp has already been out for months . 
  have you read through the whole thing and can you point to specific objectionable sections ? 
   that 's the tpp treaty , not the ttip treaty , ** the full and complete text of the ttip is still not available for the public ** not yet . 
  it will be released way before moves to vote on it . 
  that 's just standard practice and what literally everyone involved has told us . 
  i do n't know why you do n't know that . 
  there currently is n't anything * to * release - it is n't finished . 
   oh nafta , how did that work out ? 
  er , really well actually . 
   canada was sued under isds arbitration about 35 times , already lost 7 . 
   us was sued under isds arbitration over 20 times , but lost ** 0 ** so governments hardly ever lose isds cases . 
  the us does n't usually do shady things to investors . 
  why is this problematic ? 
  this demonstrates that the isds courts are n't biased against governments and that we are n't handing over massive power to corporations . 
   and a little fun fact , us isds ` cases ' are done in the worldbank offices , and the worldbank is one of the parties in any of the isds ` cases ' that delivers an ` independent ' ~ ~ judge ~ ~ lawyer as one of the 3 arbitrators . 
  as i said , ttip is likely to establish its own transatlantic arbitration court - something france asked to include . 
  if it follows tpp , hearings will be open to the public along with all documentation , the only exception being obviously where dealing with highly sensitive information . 
  so basically the same as a court . 
  well in that case it 's quite straightforward - they can give you advice on what the car is objectively worth in their experience . 
  they 're much better qualified to do so . 
  if you ca n't agree on the price , then you might go to a reputable dealer and ask them ` what would you normally sell this car for ? ', 
  that seems to me to be eminently sensible . 
  that 's not the point . 
  the point is that if you are going to argue that ttip is bad * because * of secret negotiations , you also have to argue that * all * trade and investment treaties are bad - every single one of them - because they were all negotiated in secret too . 
  so given that the content is divorced from the process , the question is whether the process should be public . 
  transparency is good , in my opinion , but negotiations ca n't be done effectively in public because it 's impossible to compromise and argue in the public glare . 
  the most effective method is to negotiate secretly and then to present a finished draft for approval . 
  criticisms can be presented then by elected representatives , and the whole process is transparent , democratic , and legitimised . 
  i see what you mean , but there 's a great reason for including industry in these things - they know what they are talking about . 
  who knows more about the europe-wide telecommunications industry , for instance ? 
  a random german green mep , or vodafone ? 
  now , of course there are legitimate concerns about whether vodafone would give advice based purely to advance their own position , but in my experience these things are taken with an enormous pinch of salt . 
  you need the input of the industries you are seeking to regulate and affect , but that does n't mean you are capitulating to them . 
  when the final draft is released , we will be able to see whether the eu has handed them lots of concessions . 
  i do n't think they will at all , but if they do i am absolutely certain that there will be national parliaments that reject the treaty . 
  well sorry about that . 
  i prefer to reply to comments that challenge me rather than hide from them , and this guy was making the same point as someone else . 
  do you expect me to type out a completely new comment even though the argument is identical ? 
  the point is that the negotiation method is not a reason to call ttip evil or bad . 
  if you want to say that the content of ttip will definitely be bad because the negotiations are in secret , you have to then say hay every trade agreement currently in force is evil - because they were all negotiated in secret too . 
  well at least you are being honest now . 
  if you do n't want any free trade then that 's fine , just do n't dress it up in a faux outrage about the way negotiations are being carried out . 
  the other problem with your ` argument ' is that [ 58 % of europeans ] ( https://fnf-northamerica.org/2015/08/05/ttip-whats-the-buzz-in-europe/ ) do want to sell the car . 
  i 'm fairly knowledgable on the subject , friend , you do n't need to be patronising . 
  it 's my job to know this stuff , isds in particular . 
  i 'd encourage you to [ read this common ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/3ew00o/rosia_montana_an_omen_for_ttip_romanians_decided/ctjc7sb ) and the ensuing discussion that i wrote a little while ago , to help you understand your large misconceptions on the isds system . 
  forcing the privatisation of state assets will not be included in the treaty . 
  put a reminder on me . 
  i 'll be the first out the door against it if it does and make a big apology . 
  it would be absolutely unprecedented in all of the history of these trade agreements . 
  you have been lied to . 
  it also will not allow companies to circumvent environmental legislation . 
  for an example , just read tpp , specifically chapter 9 section b , article 9.16 :  nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a party from adopting , maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental , health or other regulatory objectives . 
  i expect to see even more stringent protection in ttip . 
  i analysed the tpp isds provisions [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/tradeissues/comments/3rnbkf/a_first_analysis_of_the_dispute_resolution/ ) i 'm sure that if you are as fair minded as you think you are , you will give all this some serious thought . 
  copied from a response to another poster - to give you an example i would give a child : you want to buy my car . 
  i want to sell my car . 
  but we do n't agree on price . 
  you want to buy it for # 20,000 , and i think it 's worth # 40,000 . 
  now what would normally happen ? 
  you would offer me # 10,000 and i would scoff and offer it for # 50,000 . 
  we would negotiate and barter , and eventually probably arrive at # 30,000 . 
  seems completely fair , does n't it ? 
  but let 's say that each of us have a large extended family of 100 people . 
  your 100 are partly paying for the car , and mine are getting a cut of the sale .
