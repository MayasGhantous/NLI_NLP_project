  timetables and suchlike will use 24 hour clock but in general speech we tend to use am/pm . 
  my mother-in-law ( age 78 ) says this , or `` god bless '' , but she 's catholic and very religious . 
  brits tend to look favourably on other commonwealth countries . 
  marmite on toast sounds pretty damn awesome to me . 
  i do n't think many people do that every day . 
  maybe once a week . 
  most people i know have a bowl of cereal . 
  or just coffee . 
  anyone who wants one can have ours . 
  i prefer dubbing because my vision is too poor to read subtitles unless i 'm sitting really close . 
  in the uk the child automatically gets the father 's surname , so for instance the russian daughter 's name would be ivanov , not ivanova . 
  but it 's a simple process to change it by deed poll . 
   do you believe in one or more god ( s ) ? 
  no  are you a member of a religious society ? 
  my parents are atheists too so i was raised with religion playing no part in my life . 
   do you ever say a prayer , meditate , etc ? 
  meditate sometimes , as a relaxation technique . 
   whether or not you go to a church/mosque/temple etc. 
  or not , do you perceive yourself as ... ... confidently atheist  what is your general perception of religion ? 
  religion is the source of most of the hate in the world , and the cause of most of the war . 
  on an individual basis it can be beneficial , giving people hope and community where they may otherwise have none , but on a global scale it 's probably the worst thing to ever happen to humanity . 
   in before hyper-atheists starts explaining to me why being a christian is wrong : it does n't bother me if other people choose to be religious . 
  christianity is wrong * for me * but if it benefits * you * , go for it . 
  ah yes you 're right , i 'd forgotten about that . 
  i had a bottle of mountain dew today , from a co-op in my insignificant suburb of manchester , uk . 
  it tasted like someone had crammed the sugar from three bottles of regular drink into this one bottle of mountain dew . 
  it 's legal , and possible , to drive a left-hand-drive car in the uk . 
  it just takes some getting used to driving it , that 's all . 
  i was brought up in the east midlands ( lincolnshire ) and though i 've lived for the last 30 years in manchester , i have n't really picked up the local accent at all , though i do use some local favourite words ( gobsmacked = shocked , ginnel = passage between houses , barm = bread roll/cob , manky = dirty ) . 
  people around here think i talk `` posh '' . 
  people from southern england think i 'm northern but they ca n't pinpoint exactly where from . 
  only once , about 5 years ago , someone made a passable guess at where my accent was from , he said nottingham , which was off by about 40 miles . 
  you could put it up on google docs maybe ? 
  as a spreadsheet , people could do their own analysis if they want to . 
  i have never been to amsterdam but i loved rotterdam and delft . 
  i recommend `` comalies '' - that 's my favourite album of theirs . 
  `` karmacode '' is good too . 
  goth band with female vocalist . 
  similar to within temptation . 
  in the uk he 'd probably be a lib-dem , which is very much middle-of-the-road moderate , despite the name . 
  within temptation ( netherlands ) nightwish ( finland ) lacuna coil ( italy ) sigur ros ( iceland ) apocalyptica ( finland ), 
  with anyone who 's also in the uk i use ordinary text messages . 
  for friends overseas i use google hangouts or skype . 
  it can be that here too , but its kind of the same thing ... `` i 'm not telling '' . 
  it means that something is secret . 
  if you ask someone a question and they do that , they do n't want to tell you . 
  its a gesture that basically means `` do n't be nosey '' or `` keep your nose out of my business '' . 
  gas ovens are awful . 
  you can taste it in the food . 
  theyre often separate with a fitted kitchen . 
  i rarely see standalone cookers nowadays . 
  india ; we gave them cricket , they gave us curries . 
  i think we got the better end of the deal . 
  nowhere in the world has a climate like this . 
  a constant year-round temperature is only possible near the equator and in that case it will be hotter . 
  anywhere but the uk i guess . 
  blade runner . 
  its my favourite movie of all time . 
  there are loads in manchester . 
  my favourite american food is probably pulled pork but they all put too much bbq sauce on it . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-37453881.html ) is a property currently for sale in hale barns , near manchester , which is a suburb-of-choice for manchester united players . 
  my guess on this one , around # 5 million . 
  wrestling died out here ( uk ) in the early 80s when they scrapped saturday eveni g wrestling on itv . 
  big daddy , giant haystacks , kendo nagasaki ... 
  i grew up with those guys . 
  weirdest pizzas i 've seen is in a `` fusion '' restaurant in manchester ; japanese pizza with teriyaki beef and noodles ? 
  moroccan with spiced lamb ? 
  their spanish ( seafood and chorizo ) is nice but they ruin it by adding peas . 
  my house was built in 1939 and it is the oldest building i 've been in today . 
  but yesterday i was in a pub that was originally built in 1552 , and in the 1970s it was moved brick by brick to a new location to make way for a shopping mall . 
  then in 1999 it was moved again , following the ira bombing in manchester . 
  that would be awesome . 
  i 've been inside a few times ; sometimes just to wander round and take pictures , once i attended a party there ( they have rooms for hire for weddings etc ) . 
  manchester 's town hall ( completed in 1877 ) is an amazing piece of neo-gothic architecture . 
  it looks like a cathedral , both inside and out .

  http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_whqltm5xrie/ti9myac8uci/aaaaaaaaaek/dsohraatxti/s400/arndale_centre-manchester-400x300.jpg it also has this monstrosity perched on top of it : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/manchester_arndale_tower.jpg/426px-manchester_arndale_tower.jpg when the ira bombed manchester in 1996 people sent `` thank you '' notes to them , but sadly they did n't do a very good job and though parts of it have been modernised since then , some of it still looks like its original 1972 design . 
  uk here . 
  i would call that a large car . 
  i was under the impression that the law had changed since then . 
  i may be wrong though . 
  british here . 
  i would get wine diluted with lemonade from age 12 , at family occasions . 
  graduated onto `` proper `` drinks at 16 . 
  was legal then for kids age 14 + to drink at home with parental consent . 
  i 'm not that crazy . 
  but yes , that 's typical too . 
  barbecues are common in the uk in summer . 
  the faintest whiff of sunshine and everyone 's out cooking in the garden . 
  the food is fairly boring though . 
  usually burgers , sausages and chicken drumsticks . 
  not my thing at all . 
  sometimes if there is a local election in the same year as a general election , it will be held on the same day . 
  i have never seen more than two ballots at once though . 
  national elections are nearly always held on the first thursday in may . 
  sometimes a local election would have to be held at a different time , particularly if an mp has died or resigned . 
  its not just the dilution ; lowering the temperature will kill the flavours . 
  of course if you 're drinking bells or teachers , maybe you want to do that ... 
  good sign of the quality/skill of a bartender when you order scotch ( especially single malt ) .
