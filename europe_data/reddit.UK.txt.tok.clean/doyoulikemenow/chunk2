   we will negotiate about returning some of what i stole from you , while i continue to steal from you . 
  * they know they 're not getting any serious right of return ( even though according to international law , they are completely entitled to it by the way ) . 
  they have n't dropped the demand because that 's not how you negotiate . 
  you do n't give up legitimate claims until you 've actually got a deal . 
  * in 1967 , israel started a war against egypt ( albeit with a lot of provocation ) . 
  why does that mean that someone else 's children have to live in refugee camps today ? 
  do you think german children today should live in refugee camps ?

  in particular ,  at the meeting , mordechai praised the palestinian security apparatus , stating the `` west bank is the only region with stability and calm amid a region that is full of security risks such as jordan , syria , lebanon , egypt and gaza . '' he also declared that israel will allow additional palestinian military forces in the west bank because israel has new information about certain palestinian parties who intend to attack israeli settlers .

  by giving back some more of the land they stole ?

  we could talk about all the amazing british scientists , poets , authors , doctors , explorers , etc. 
  britain has a fantastic wealth of culture and a rich and vibrant history . 
  and so does russia . 
  however , the context here was `` imperialism '' . 
  i have a low opinion of britain and russia * when it comes to imperialism * ( as i do of any imperialism ) , and i do think people in both countries have trouble admitting that ( as do people in most other countries btw ), 
  i was being a bit facetious , in response to your similarly exaggerated claim . 
  both countries have done terrible things . 
  both countries have too high an opinion of themselves * on average * . 
  i guarantee you that most british people do n't view themselves as `` evil '' . 
  russia is the loser and views itself as good . 
  \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af it 's helpful to be self-critical ... 
  the question was not about `` our past '' . 
  it was `` do you think britain 's ** history of colonialism ** is ... part of our history that we should proud happened ? '', 
  it was n't a question about british history in general , but rather about `` colonialism '' , defined as  the policy or practice of acquiring full or partial political control over another country , occupying it with settlers , and exploiting it economically . 
  the question essentially reads `` are you proud of britain exploiting other countries in the past ? '', 
  yes , many good things came out of it . 
  yes , everyone else was exploiting too . 
  yes , it was a different time . 
  but i still think it 's unreasonable to say `` i 'm proud of britain exploiting other countries in the past '' . 
  blah blah victors write the blah . 
  a poll asking germans if they viewed the period of 1933-1945 as `` part of our history that we should proud happened '' probably is n't going to elicit many responses about fanta and the autobahn .

   i do n't understand why they are n't an ally of the west , and if anyone could explain it to me i would be very thankful . 
  without justifying the crimes of the islamists in iran , try and see recent iranian history from the ` iranian perspective ' . 
  america and the uk overthrew the elected iranian government in 1953 in order to prevent them nationalising their oil . 
  we replaced him with a pretty brutal dictatorship under the shah , whose secret service , the savak , tortured thousands of people to death . 
  then the islamists seized power in the revolution in 1979 and took a bunch of westerners hostage in the american embassy because they were pissed off that the americans had granted asylum to the shah , which in turn royally pissed off the west . 
  then the west armed and encouraged iraq in a war of conquest in order to seize iranian territory which lasted 8 years from 1980 to 1988 , which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of iranians . 
  then the americans invaded and occupied iran 's [ neighbours on both sides ] ( http://www.notmytribe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/middleeast-map-iran-iraq-israel-us.gif ) , without a great deal of justification beyond ` we thought he had weapons ' and ` they were sheltering terrorists ' , resulting in utter devastation and hundreds of thousands of lives lost . 
  then when the iranians were toying with the idea of developing nuclear weapons , largely in response to seeing two of their neighbouring countries ` regime-changed ' , the west imposed crippling sanctions which seriously damaged the iranian economy . 
  regardless of the fact that the americans , israelis , british and french and russians -- some of the most war-loving countries in the world -- are apparently free to have as many nuclear weapons and to bomb invade and occupy as they like without having to be sanctioned . 
  so yeah , that 's why there 's a lot of hostility towards the west . 
  much as many iranian people might appreciate western liberalism and democracy ... it 's hard to forget that much bloodshed and war . 
   however , the turkish state instilled this major victim complex in most citizens since time immemorial . 
  hey , americans celebrate murdering innocent turkey every thanksgiving ... coincidence ? 
  i think not . 
  `` viewing as a * major * threat '' and `` viewing favourably '' are very different things . 
  it 's perfectly consistent to say that `` germans tend to view russian influence more negatively than do other states '' and `` germans tend to think that russia is less of a threat to its neighbours than do other states '' . 
  also , this is pretty subjective due to the difference between `` minor threat '' and `` major threat '' . 
  adding up both categories , 86 % of germans view russia as a threat to its neighbours . 
   the strongest opposition to responding with armed force is in germany ( 58 % ) of course it is , because they 've been teaching their children that `` war is not the answer '' for the last 70 years . 
  regardless of public opinion , germany remains a committed member of nato . 
  government policy is as firm as it 's ever been . 
  i 'd also repeat again that the german government has been instrumental in maintaining sanctions against russia for their aggression against ukraine . 
  frankly , i think that your attitude is an overreaction to some pretty uncontroversial opinion polls . 
  i can understand the feelings of abandonment in the face of russian bellicosity . 
  even so , if a nato/eu state is attacked , germany is highly likely to honour its commitments , just like the rest of the eu . 
  if you want to talk about attitudes , sure . 
  i think most of the guilt in germany is directed towards the wwii victors , at least in part because the country is largely aligned with france and the uk . 
  however , germany should n't be expected to neglect its own financial interests -- no more than britain , france , russia , the us , japan , china , etc. 
  should neglect their own financial interests , because of all the crimes they committed . 
  nordstream seems to be a purely financial/economic issue .
