  am i missing something here ? 
  i certainly think comparing it to the ribbentrop-molotov pact is wrong . 
  support for putin ? 
  well , there are morons in every country . 
  but , [ germany as a whole views russia less favourably than almost every other country polled ] ( http://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2012_country_ratings/bbc2492_m2bt_ctry.gif ) . 
  what poll are you thinking of , and how do the results compare in other countries ? 
  and finally , regarding the ukraine , merkel has been pretty influential in creating and maintaining the sanctions that have been imposed on russia . 
  germany has very firmly sided with east europe * against * russia . 
  i agree that an inflated sense of self-importance and refusal to own up to past crimes is something most countries do ... 
  however , if i had to name a single country that has `` swallowed their pride and moved forward '' , it 's germany . 
  it 's cos of all the [ drugs and whoring !,

  pickpocketing does not make people wealthy . 
  i genuinely do n't know if we 're being sarcastic any more . 
  i was pointing out that this ` cultural problem ' not a problem unique to islamic areas . 
  the example i gave was a poor christian area in nigeria . 
  i could equally have pointed to poor hindu areas in india , poor buddhist areas in south east asia , etc. 
  i do agree it 's a cultural problem . 
  but go to christian areas of third world countries -- nigeria for example -- and see if they treat women in a western fashion . 
  i think they kind of hoped that everyone would have got over the whole crimea incident by now ...

  who needs 'em . 
  i 'll just go make my own car , computer and cell phone with some elbow grease and good old british ingenuity .

  they missed a perfectly good opportunity for a war !, 
  `` irish '', 
   also ffs have your government support your students properly . 
  universities are learning centres not cash cows ( cows being the students ) :(, 
  it all starts so [ innocently ] ( http://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/awbdn9r_700b.jpg ) . 
  believe me , i 'm not going to disagree with you that incitement of this kind exists and that it 's wrong . 
  however , i do remain by my original position that it 's not the main cause of violence . 
  [ i 'd also note that even the shin bet does n't believe that the pa is behind the current violence and/or incitement . 
  ] ( http://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/shin-bet-to-cabinet-abbas-not-behind-terror-but-fatah-officials-involved-in-incitement-422603 )  the official reason for the settlements is apparently that there are too many big cities near the current border , if you can call it that . 
  well , i think the justifications for the settlements and occupation are often more complex than that . 
  however , i think the `` security case '' for settlements is exceptionally poor . 
  on the one hand , it has n't removed the palestinians from the areas near israeli cities where they can carry out acts of violence . 
  on the other hand , it 's provided them with great motivation to commit these acts of violence . 
  i do think that the desire to take land and resources , as well as religious motivation , plays a massive part in the settlement enterprise . 
  i also find it interesting you compare soviet russia with israel . 
  soviet russia were in the wrong !, 
  they were the `` evil empire '' !, 
  it is wrong to seize parts of other countries because you feel that it will make your country more secure . 
  let 's be clear . 
  incitement to kill civilians is wrong . 
  there 's a lot of it that goes on , and i condemn that . 
  but i do n't see any of that in this video . 
  incitement to resist israel , the occupation and israeli soldiers by means of violence is legitimate . 
  violence against occupations is how most occupations in history have ended -- whether in algeria under the french occupation , palestine/israel under the british occupation , the american colonies under british rule , europe under nazi occupation , east asia under japanese occupation , and so on and so forth . 
  an occupied people has the right to use violence against * soldiers of an occupying army * . 
  this is a right that was claimed by [ jewish fighters/terrorists under british occupation in palestine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zionist_political_violence ) . 
  at no point in that video did anyone incite anyone to kill civilians . 
  `` dying in a hail of bullets '' is pretty clearly in reference to fighting against soldiers . 
  [ khaled jawabreh ] ( http://www.demotix.com/photo/9160900/mourners-carry-body-22-years-old-khaled-jawabreh ) , who is being celebrated here , was someone killed in a protest against israeli troops . 
  referring to the al-aqsa mosque as occupied or as `` this is your mosque '' is true . 
  `` this is your jerusalem '' is only true of east jerusalem , but this is the kind of rhetoric virtually all israeli politicians engage in . 
  which is why we totally need a `` hitler scholarship '' for german vets !, 
  / s my point was n't `` there 's no black and white '' , but just that you ca n't ignore the `` black '' parts when it comes to high profile things like this . 
  on balance , rhodes is not a figure that should be celebrated -- at least within the context of africa . 
  pfffft !, 
  [ we will beat you one-handed ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6451152/lord-nelson-returned-to-work-half-an-hour-after-losing-arm.html ) !, 
  yeah , and hitler was kind to dogs . 
  / s there 's still enough `` black '' in the `` black and white '' of this particular figure to merit at least considering dropping the name . 
   percentage of palestinians who think a palestinian government control all the land between the river jordan and the sea . 
   percentage of israelis who think a jewish government should control all land between the river jordan and the sea . 
  neither is going to be close to 100 % . 
  both are going to be far above 0 % . 
  the closest i could find to polling on this is something like [ this ] ( http://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/poll-finds-fading-support-for-two-state-solution-between-israelis-palestinians-407222 ) from june 2015 . 
   the research showed that 51 percent of israeli respondents favored the two-state solution  palestinian support for the two-state also rested at 51 % i.e. 
  ** very similar views on both sides ** . 
  in the general sentiment ? 
  like the `` general sentiment '' in israel is to continue the occupation ? 
  the situation regarding israeli offers is a little more complicated than that . 
  [ this is a good comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3xl80h/greece_to_recognize_palestinian_state/cy5u2ad ) in r/worldnews which i thought was quite balanced . 
  it says it does n't exist . 
  firstly , this idea of `` they want to occupy the whole of israel '' ... 
  this is exactly the kind of overgeneralisation that prolongs this kind of conflict . 
  the reason that a palestinian can stab an innocent jewish civilian is because he or she thinks the exact same thing . 
  `` they want to occupy us '' . 
  no differentiation at all . 
  no recognition that jews are different people with different beliefs . 
  to them , he or she is n't a civilian , but just one of `` they '' , the occupiers . 
  and this is the reason that many israelis support continued occupation . 
  they do n't see innocent individuals . 
  they just say `` they '' , the terrorist , the islamic , the inciter . 
  it 's healthier to try not to think like this . 
  there is a significant percentage of palestinians who want all the former mandate . 
  there is a significant percentage of israelis who want all the former mandate . 
  this does n't justify occupying the territories , just as it would n't justify occupying israel . 
  in terms of `` incitement '' -- absolutely . 
  there is a lot of incitement on the palestinian side , * as well as on the israeli side * . 
  do you remember [ this , for example ] ( http://www.informationliberation.com/files/192642682_2fea4cce66_o.jpg ) ? 
  however , once again , this does not justify the occupation . 
   i 'm not saying this as an excuse . 
  i very explicitly stated that i was not offering any justification . 
  i 'm offering you an explanation of * why * there 's support for these attacks . 
  if you want to stop people doing something , you need to understand * why * they do it . 
  a large part of that `` why '' is 48 years of brutal occupation , in which generation after generation of palestinian children have grown up seeing foreign soldiers stealing their land , bombing their houses and killing their people . 
  in the same way , one might speak about poverty being a factor in causing crime ( without in any way justifying that crime !,
