  gosh , i wonder why a polish law and justice mp might be annoyed with the eu lately . 
  and english is n't their mother tongue , so not knowing the technical difference between ape and monkey is understandable . 
  do you know those words in dutch ? 
  right , so you were n't being serious . 
  got it . 
  you . 
  do you seriously think they 're calling gibraltarians apes ? 
  gibraltar is famous for about three things , and you 're probably failing to know one of them . 
  it 's in the tories ' best interest to lose scotland . 
  most of their support is in england . 
  england would forever be run by the conservative party . 
  i honestly ca n't tell if you 're being serious . 
  the recent gibraltar referendum was in the high 90s too , but not quite as extreme as the falklands . 
  it is the only national flag that has purple in it . 
  no current flag contains any of substance . 
  i kinda like it . 
  oh i got my information about martin schultz from wikipedia . 
  you 'd think that they would have updated it . 
  but yes , it 's important that we understand how the various institutions are elected . 
  the irony during the brexit debate was that the eu was unelected when we have the house of lords . 
  well , the council of europe is mostly irrelevant , apart from the european convention on human rights , and the court that goes with it . 
  it was created in 1949 , thanks to winston churchill . 
  ( did i mention that the british were instrumental in creating the echr ? ), 
  as for the eu , it 's fairly simple : there 's the * ** european commission ** , who is the executive . 
  ** jean-claude juncker ** is the president of the european commission . 
  * ** european council ** , which is the heads of states from each country , meeting quarterly to decide the general policy direction . 
  ** donald tusk ** is the president of the european council . 
  * ** council of the european union ** , which is the relevant minister from each country for the topic on discussion . 
  one of the two legislative institutions . 
  the presidency is rotated between each country every six months and is currently with ** malta ** . 
  * ** european parliament ** , which is the directly elected legislative chamber . 
  the current president of the european parliament is ** martin schulz ** . 
  * ** court of justice of the european union ** . 
  the judicial branch that deals with matters of eu law . 
  this includes the european court of justice , which deals with cases involving the member states rather than individuals . 
  the president of the court of justice is ** koen lenaerts ** . 
  * ** european central bank ** , which is the central bank of the eu . 
  the president of the european central bank is ** mario draghi ** * ** european court of auditors ** , which makes sure that money is n't being wasted . 
  the president of the court is ** klaus-heiner lehne ** . 
  what 's so confusing about that ? 
  do n't forget the council of europe , which is n't even an eu thing . 
  because things were n't confusing enough . 
  it 's annoying that turkish membership was trotted out as a pro-brexit point , when anyone with any understanding of the situation would see that turkey was never going to join the eu in the foreseeable future , if ever . 
  i like that brazil charges us citizens the same amount for a visa as the us charges brazilians . 
  that means eu citizens can rock up visa-free , but americans need a visa before arrival at $ 160 a pop . 
  yeah from what i understand it 's only happened three times ( by the same president ) . 
  and no president has proposed a bill , even though they can . 
  if they 're not careful , that right will fall into disuse and they went be able to do so . 
  obviously it 'll be in the constitution , but the pressure not to will be great . 
  i 'm not 100 % convinced that he intended it as a lesson on the importance of limiting government power . 
  he just meant it as a joke to a bunch of teenagers , but then the press blew it out of proportion . 
  he did say it to a classroom full of kids , so yeah , i 'd say he was n't serious . 
  well he said he would ban it if he could , but it was to a classroom full of school children , so i do n't think he was very serious . 
  he then said that it was good that he could n't and is glad that he could n't , and would n't want to live anywhere where he could . 
  having just read the powers of the president of iceland , the office does have the power to pass provisional legislation , but only when parliament is not in session , and it needs to be confirmed by parliament when it does , so he could probably ban hawaiian pizzas for a couple of weeks . 
  anyway , iceland has a weak president , so in general , yeah , they ca n't do very much other than appoint the cabinet . 
  do we ? 
  we might have learnt a second language in school , but no one remembers it . 
  a foreign language is n't even compulsory any more . 
  i did n't speak a second language until i was 30, 
  from what i 've learnt recently is that you definitely want to put chorizo in it . 
  the irony being that in 1980 thatcher was considering just giving the islands to argentina because no one here had heard of them . 
  and then the military junta attempted to distract their country from their general awfulness with a good old nationalistic cause . 
  wcgw ? 
  everything . 
  now every brit has heard of the islands and will patriotically support their defense , and losing the war lead almost directly to the downfall of the dictatorship . 
  europe wants even less to do with us than we did with europe . 
  we 're fucked . 
  `` well , they would n't have had to change it if the germans had n't gotten all invadey '' , 
  well , you 're assuming they understood any of that sentence , given the average number of languages spoken by brits is just below one . 
  there should n't only be about 25 % of turkey here , 
  equally , i speak spanish in italy , because i do n't want to be * that brit * that only speaks english progressively slower and louder . 
  and i 'm saying they 've been early adopters and are already stepping up . 
  there 's a lot of wind farms across the country too . 
  they clearly know the potential of the country . 
  does n't the uk already have a lot of interconnects with france ? 
  hmm possibly only 5 % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hvdc_cross-channel and presumably this is another 2.5 % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/britned i think this should provide another 3 % by 2021 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_sea_link, 
  there are already two solar plants near sevilla . 
  what do you think the large area in the front is for ? 
  it would have been houses . 
  as the town grew , you 'd have people living outside the walls too . 
  when gunpowder and cannons became commonplace in europe , the walls did n't offer the same protection and the castle would have been abandoned for somewhere more practical . 
  just because there is n't a city there now does n't mean there was n't before . 
  they died fighting on someone else 's soil , not their own . 
  you completely misunderstood the comment you replied to . 
  `` mexico '' invaded new mexico in 1916  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_columbus_ ( 1916 ) and obviously pearl harbor , but that was n't a land battle . 
  there is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleutian_islands_campaign fought in part of alaska , but i do n't think the population of the island was very high . 
  yeah , i would support a referendum on the deal we get from the eu before we leave ( assuming article 50 is revocable ) so that we know what we 're voting for . 
  whoops , yes . 
  can i claim autocorrect ? 
  it 's due to the glorious revolution and the bill of rights act 1688/9 . 
  parliament declared king james ii to have effectively advocated by fleeing . 
  william of orange and king james ' daughter , mary were invited to the crown on the condition that they were only there by the will of parliament . 
  technically the prime minister does n't need to be the leader of the largest party . 
  they just need to be an mp that can command the confidence of the house of commons . 
  harold macmillan was not leader of the conservative party when he was asked if he could form an government for example . 
  although he was made the leader when it was clear he could form one . 
  unless you live in witney you did n't vote for david cameron and even then you did n't vote for him to be prime minister . 
  you voted for him to be a member of parliament . 
  if you were a member of the conservative party in 2005 then you got to vote for the leader of the party , based on the candidates available .
