that 's because you steal your cars from germany, 
  ok so i should have gone with * `` soviet-made assault-rifle '' * . 
  yep , because i 've never actually seen either of these guns in the flesh . 
  22 kalashnikov 's were ~ ~ seased ~ ~ ** seized * earlier this month in a small port in the south east of england . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-33925793 this however was only the importers - these guns are coming through eastern europe . 
  i 'm quite glad we dont have american style gun laws in britain , but its much easier to sneak them into france / holland than our little island . 
  edit - corrected by / u/sbjf the grammar nazi, 
  how do you know that someone is from estonia ? 
  they 'll tell you they 're '' * right next to finland * '' despite only having land borders with latvia and russia, 
  i was the one being violated . 
  even with my keeping within the lane markings , and driving at the posted speed limit , it was clear that this kind of behavior was not acceptable i was so relieved that i made it to the estonian border alive . 
  i think you 'd be better finding whoever is responsible for latvia 's driver training program , and shooting them . 
  four-a-breast on a two lane highway is not fucking normal . 
  no , russian oligarchs investing in london properties . 
  its either here or cyprus . 
  they want to have legitimate holdings outside of russia for tax purposes , or if they ever had to leave . 
  there are some 600k poles + others working here , but they are mostly under 40 and mostly would have been educated after the fall of the soviet union . 
  the london borough of chelski, 
   sort of a statue that 's called a plinth, 
  red = in danger http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/, 
  ale does indeed have nordic roots because traditionally rye is used in the malt . 
  i 'm not sure where `` lager '' comes form when we use beer for an all encompassing term ? 
  i agree , i can see my bill is likely to come down to balance competition , maybe yours will likely go up a bit . 
  ot question , but did prices rise much when you guys joined the euro ? 
  i was living in estonia when they changed over and the big complaint at the time was the rise in the cost of living - groceries and fuel particularly . 
  fire damage would make new debts . 
  im not sure how this will work when it comes to network deals like `` free to call same network '' and data data and other bundles . 
  i use giffgaff in the uk ( a small operator that runs on o2 ) that offer bundles of `` free calls to other giffgaff '' , airtime and data * but * the standard charges are really not that great . 
  the only reason anyone would use this network is for the data bundles or free airtime allowance , rather than metered access . 
  when overseas the bundles would likely be invalid and so the not so appealing `` standard '' metered charges would then apply . 
  it took them a few deceads to overcome the corporate resistance to it . 
  * an englishman 's home is his castle * also did you notice they missed saaremaa and hiiumaa off the drug problem map ? 
  does that mean no fentanyl on the islands ? 
  or are they not counted as estonia any more ? 
  [ norway and finland be like ... ] ( https://youtu.be/wamjp35dlki?t=17s ) got to hand it to sweden for keeping the saab going . 
  torybots, 
  anything to divert attention from cameron 's tax affairs, 
  northern somalia was apparently conquered by poseidon, 
  almost everyone in finland is a [ black metal fan ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i8popfs.png ), 
  you would n't insist on interviewing the parents of a thief or a fraudster or a rapist . 
  that 's assuming radicalization happens at the home , in reality the parents want to distance them selves from it . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  money is completely relevant , its the way wealth passes down the generations is what 's important . 
  there are 3 types of wealthy people - new money ( popstars/footballers/lottery winners etc. ), 
  industrialists ( entrepreneurs / businessmen ) landed gentry ( lords / peers / royalty ) - all * inherited * their money , but also their lands , houses and titles from several generations back ( i.e. 
  before the industrial revolution , a time when the other two did n't exist ) the new money will be spent in 2 generations and will no longer be wealthy . 
  the industrialists money may last longer but will never compete with the 9th earl of harrowby and his 10,000 acre estate of 20 farms and parkland . 
  housing is what defines class . 
  adele is from nw london , arguably the essex end of london . 
  ( google [ essex girls ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=essex+girl&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiy7jk2xsxlahwjbz4khzngcaoq_auibygb&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=763 ) ) i 'd agree definately not upper class , but that is not to do with her earnings , and her earnings do not define class . 
  class is where you live , specifically , the environment in which you were brought up . 
  over-simply put its divided 3 ways - council estates , suburbs or rural mansions . 
  i live in the cheapest house in town . 
  # 850/m for 40m2 , bills extra . 
  it 's half my wage . 
  housing is what defines class . 
  [ did you look at the map ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dluqsmx.png ) ~ i have literally just had this exact same argument, 
  [ i think you 'll find that it is . 
  ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=scandinavia ), 
   only maybe 5 % of finnish people can actually speak swedish * as a first language on 2006 estimates . 
  ( get the wiki quote right ) swedish remained the ** only official language ** up until 1863 . 
  finnish only began to gain dominance after independence in 1917 , finland has since then been a ** bilingual country ** with a swedish-speaking ( ruling ) minority . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland_swedish#history ) further reading on [ finland 's language strife ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland's_language_strife ) will teach you about the struggles of finish to be officially recognised , and the ability of finish speakers to secure top jobs in both the private and government sectors . 
  its a huge part of finnish identity and is a totally relevant measure . 
   if i remember right there 's some sort of organisation or whatever which handles all the scandinavian thingies and all that . 
  you mean the nordic council ? 
  you 're trying to win an argument whilst being spectacularly under informed , and willfully ignorant . 
  you 'd do well to give up . 
  do n't make that sound like a challenge !, 
  maybe they were / u/deadthewholetime they were filling in the reports !, 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'll ^ ^ ^ see ^ ^ ^ myself ^ ^ ^ out . 
  a quick wiki : france 67mil , sweden 9.8 mil that could stack up !, 
   last time i checked , scandinavia included only those countries that are located on the scandinavian peninsula . 
  you mentioned nothing about linguistics here , you simply claimed  last time i checked , scandinavia included only those countries that are located on the scandinavian peninsula . 
  therefore excluding denmark , and including northern finland . 
  * now * you want to categorise by linguistics , fine . 
  if you do want to do it by linguistics to include denmark you must also include finland as swedish is an official language of finland . 
  and also you must include iceland due to its historical linguistic links with denmark and norway . 
  ( i 'm well aware of the nature of the finno-ugric languages , as my wife is estonian ) so which is it ? 
  geography or languages ? 
   scandinavia included only those countries that are located on the scandinavian peninsula so that would exclude denmark then ? 
  and include most of northern finland !, 
   the scandinavian peninsula is a peninsula in northern europe , which today covers ** norway , sweden ** and ** most of northern finland ** . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_peninsula ) looks like * you * need to check again !, 
  swedish is an officially recognised language in finland for 1 google scandinavia , and you get [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dluqsmx.png ) for 2 you 're welcome !, 
  there 's a line from the film [ the lives of others ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/ ) that claims soviet east germany stopped counting suicides , but classed them as `` self murders '' . 
  but honestly , i dont know if there is any truth to this . 
  i wonder if jihadist bombers are counted in the french figures ? 
  in totally unrelated news , scandinavian countries are among the highest suicide rates in europe . 
  [ is it somthing like this ? 
   what 's life without a little adventure ? 
  erm ... 
  arriving at your destination on time , without breaking down . 
  being able to sustain a minimum safe highway speed . 
  and not looking like you 've been pressed through a colander in the event of an accident . 
  is quite a trade off against `` being able to fix yourself '' and `` good fuel economy '' . 
  ** why ? 
  for the love of god why ????? 
  export market yo .
