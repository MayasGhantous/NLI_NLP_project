  8 has a british number plate and is right hand drive, 
  do n't think its not newsworthy , but i 'm british , i live in the thames valley and the first i 've heard of this story the line  the problem is made even worse by low temperatures ... bothers me , whilst technically true , we are experiencing way above average temperatures this winter . 
  this is a `` look down the nose at you '' from the moscow state-sponsored mouthpiece . 
  well enjoy . 
  my point was simply your use of * `` extremely antiquated waste infrastructure '' * when london has a much older system serving a far greater population density than that of most us cities . 
  but if were going to make this a game - play on . . 
  i like how this is brought to our attention by rt , as if the sewers in moscow or st petersburg are some how clean and bright like chandelier ballrooms , and not crumbling and full of shit like everyone elses . 
  the thames basin infrastructure . 
  most of it , especially wastewater , is pretty fucking old . 
  oh i noticed , it was for both of you . 
  this is / r/europe though , you might be lost . 
  your `` antiquated '' systems are nothing compared to the thames basin infrastructure . 
  most of it , especially wastewater , is older than your country . 
  about the same as swedish automotive marques still owned by the swedes lets see : volvo , sold to ford in 1999 , then onto the zhejiang geely holding group of china in 2010 . 
  scanina trucks , 100 % owned by vw . 
  saab was sold off to gm , then onto the dutch spyker company . 
  saab aerospace was once 1/3rd owned by britain 's bae systems and continued a 20 % stake for 16 years - they only sold last year and not back to the swedes . . globalisation affects all markets , even the black ones . 
  now climb down from you high horse . 
  they 're used to the middle east climate . 
  it 's cold af in the baltics with depressingly short days and its only november . 
   `` there seems to be this view that ` we 're a big important economy , the europeans export a lot to us , so they have got to give us what we want ... `` individually most of these countries do n't export that much to the uk , and were seeing a hardening of attitudes , '' this is the bottom line here . 
  we have very little to gain , almost everything to loose and no bargaining position . 
  the `` monied elites '' do n't keep their wealth in the uk , in # sterling , they hide it offshore . 
  it 's not just the cost of materials and labour to make it , road signage is * always * bigger than you think it is , and the reflective material used is over gb # 60 + a sq meter . 
  it 's the cost of putting 2 guys in a van for x hours drive , + fuel , then to put it up and drive back . 
  edit : i work in signs and graphics, 
  more like the american car industry and its regulators are happy to point the finger at imported cars , but not so happy to point at their own . 
  its the same reason why european car industry does n't like american made cars and they use the euro ncap saftey specs to keep most of then out . 
  same in the uk too . 
  you ca n't drive any european registered vehicle in the uk on a uk licence . 
  iirc the only 2 exceptions are driving on [ motor traders plates ] ( http://www.heritagecarinsurance.co.uk/tradesureinsurance/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/10/what-are-trade-plates-uk.jpg ) or it is a company truck , and you are working ( i.e. 
  on a drivers log card ) and are driving to or from the port . 
  are these the same guys who did the song about `` gays doing squat thrusts on a mirror floor without underpants '' ? 
   it 's a semi because it 's not a full sized trailer . 
  so you have standardised trailers twice the size of a semi on us roads ? 
  no you do n't . 
  duplex is ambiguous in terms of property specification , as it has multiple definitions . 
  ( do n't even get me started on american ( mis ) use of semi !, 
  as in - trailer - half a trailer ? 
  it 's called an articulated lorry [ or `` artic '' ] because it has a bend in it . ), 
  a duplex could be half a house with a garden , or a top floor flat with no garden . 
  it 's ambiguous . 
  a detached house is obviously not attached . 
  but thats the point . 
  it looking at it from the point of * de * tachment not attachment . 
  semi is latin for half , so is literally `` half detached . '', 
  a semi-detached can only mean its surrounded by its own garden on three sides . 
  its very specific . 
  if it shares a communal entrance , its an apartment . 
  duplex is pretty ambiguous , it does n't make sense to me - estate agent bullshit no doubt . 
  here its simple . 
  semi-detached is for two home houses with two entrances . 
  a two floor `` under and over '' duplex would be a maisonette . 
  from french - literally `` small house '' - an apartment ( flat ) with an entirely separate entrance . 
  if the entrance is shared its a `` block of flats '' , or if the row of houses is more than two together , then its a `` terrace '' . 
  in british english . 
  '' [ semi-detached . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semi-detached ) '' our most common housing format ( 34 % ) as most of the post war council housing was built like this . 
  this is from the disused border checkpoint next to the highway . 
  the dutch decided to resurface the access road . 
  the belgians did not . 
  i never said it was . 
  it was just an example . 
  corrections should be legally required to have the same prominence . 
  if you plaster outrageous lies on your front page , it should be required to publish your corrections on the front page in the same size typeface with the same level of prominence . 
  38 % of the total electorate is not a majority . 
  there 's a fair chunk of us who are - but dont tar us all with the same brush . 
  when you post an article about british people described as `` little englanders '' in a captioned photo of the lord of the rings hobbit village , are you supprised that we do n't like your `` fair '' examination ? 
  you ? 
  i 'm british and married to an eu national . 
  this is an issue with the press narrative pandering to the under informed . 
  rupert murdoch has a lot to answer for . 
   though i would argue that britain has been irresponsible on this subject all its own . 
  the fault with britain lies with the conservative party and the right wing press . 
  this referendum was party-political to stem the defection to the populist , and the fire was stoked by the sun and the daily mail fear mongering to the working classes . 
  oh yeah , there 's nothing like improving a party atmosphere by leaving it . 
  they ** are ** idiots - all 51.9 % of them . 
  i 'm in the uk and i 'm free to tell you that you are spectacularly underinformed . 
  well , putin did claim the scottish referendum was fixed , and to be honest , i 'd be inclined to believe him . 
  if anyone knows what a fixed referendum looks like , its vladimir putin . 
  he 's a world leading expert in this field . 
  nordica is a joint venture between the estonian government and slovenian adria airways . 
  they knew . 
  not as pissed as i was when the european commission [ forced the closure of estonian air ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_air#cessation_of_operations ) , nordica 's predecessor , in november last year . 
  we had flights booked for christmas and could n't get an alternative that late . 
  apparently they were being propped up by the taxpayer whilst the board awarded themselves $ million salarys . 
  hopefully this setup backed by the estonian government and slovenian adria airways would be an improvement on estonian air . 
  well , putin did comment on the scottish referendum claiming it was full of electoral fraud . 
  if anyone knows what a rigged election lools like it 's vladimir putin, 
  `` assassination is the extreme form of censorship . '', 
  - george bernard shaw, 
  wealth is relative . 
  you think living in parts of england on minimum wage is a good life ? 
  this article proves there are many visitors/holidaymakers who are underinsured . 
  we already know this . 
  what about the ones already resident who ca n't afford insurance ? 
  yes , and a significant number ca n't afford private heath cover . 
  so the nhs stops paying , then what ? 
  forced repatriations ? 
  or let them die in the streets ?
