   liverpool is really chill i 'm pretty sure that because harry enfield and his chums kept saying `` calm down calm down '' over and over . 
  not strictly within the rules of your request , but i recently watched this polish series and was quite impressed . 
  wataha ( the border ) by hbo europe about a team of polish border guards on the poland-ukraine border . 
  not getting out of london, 
  not a rejection as such but ... 
  the hoover vacuum cleaner company was giving away free transatlantic flights with purchases . 
  they were worth many times the price of the products being sold . 
  they went bust , surprisingly . 
  simple really , be really fucking good at what you do . 
  and the sister subreddit r/anormaldayinrussia, 
  florida . 
  rampant alcoholism and substance abuse . 
  classless hicks with no sense of shame or public decency . 
  terrible drivers . 
  akrapovi\u010d motorcycle exhausts . 
  best in the world . 
   women are indeed beautiful agreed, 
  that * was * my original point . 
  `` with less farming '' [ than saaremaa ], 
  commercial agriculture is a rural employer . 
  there is less of it around parnu . 
  parnu is pretty dead in winter without tourists . 
  not much in the way of commercial agriculture compared to other parts of the country . 
  considering estonia 's 2nd city ( tartu ) is under 100k people , there is really only one place to go to find work in estonia . 
  there is no work on saaremaa or any other islands besides farming and tourism . 
  the same goes for parnu , but with less farming . 
  source : married to a tallinn-er , lived there for a year . 
  yes it is . 
   gave the appearance of scaremongering , very little attempt was made at a positive case by whom exactly ? 
  the murdoch press !, 
  those on lower wages and those without higher education were statistically more likely to vote leave . 
  those who read tabloid papers were *** told *** to vote leave . 
  there is undeniably overlap between these groups . 
  the economic arguments were increasingly ignored with each step further down the socio-economic ladder . 
  that 's not sneering . 
  that a fact . 
  it is up to the the population , all individuals , to inform ** themselves ** , to separate fact from fiction for themselves and excercise their democratic right at the ballot box . 
  any failure of the political classes to engage the working classes is equally met by those unwilling to engage themselves in current affairs outside of tabloid sport or celebrity . 
  whilst those same tabloids blatantly push their own agendas on those unwilling to inform themselves elsewhere . 
  `` you can lead a man to reason but you ca n't make him think . '', 
  [ also applies to germans visiting overseas ] ( https://youtu.be/yfl6lu3xqw0 ), 
  and here 's why . 
  ` never argue with an idiot . 
  they will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience . ', 
  - george carlin ` never argue with a fool , onlookers may not be able to tell the difference . ', 
  - mark twain, 
  the economic case was clearly made . 
  but complicated finance discussions and analysis ca n't compete on a level playingfield with snappy populist one liners from johnson and farage in the eyes of tabloid readers . 
  different opinions ? 
  no , not at all . 
  it 's the varying degrees of racism , xenophobia , and economic ignorance displayed by many leave voters that makes them retarded . 
  anything is possible when your country is 51.9 % retarded . 
  edit : it 's the varying degrees of racism , xenophobia , and economic ignorance displayed by many leave voters that makes them retarded . 
  i like how there is a disproportionate number of slurs directed at americans . 
  its as they 're more deserving or just easier to mock . 
  imo the correct way to behave as a foreign tourist is to behave as a guest in someone else 's home . 
  fully integrating is n't necessary , being respectful is . 
  well , you * were * in a `` forced marriage '' to russia for 50 or so years . 
  i fully confess i very know little about slovenian history . 
  i simply compared the comment you wrote to a historical figure that i do know quite a bit about . 
   it 's something that prevented our nation from disappearing in the past and it 's in times like today that we need nationalism again . 
  that could be a 1940s hitler quote . 
  i skype 'd with my grandmother last christmas when i was with my wifes family literally on the other side of europe . 
  she just turned 90 last month . 
  this woman witnessed first hand the mechanisation of farming , the birth of broadcast media , and can now have a onscreen chat with her grandson 4000 miles away . 
  this has been the stuff of fiction for her since she was in school , now its a reality . 
  what excites me is what we 'll have when i 'm 90 . 
  agreed . 
  the irish are by far the best guys to drink with . 
  as an englishman we enjoy great eating and drinking with our neighbours . 
  the irish have guinness , and nice butter and beef . 
  the scots have whisky and tunnock 's teacakes . 
  the french have fine wine and cheese . 
  and the welsh have lots of sheep . 
  because this sub , and reddit in general is not representative of the respective nations electorate . 
  case in point : brexit - reddit 's opinion vs the result . 
  well , we 're not exactly speaking french here are we ? 
  so there 's that . 
  finland is already best buds with estonia . 
  ( sorry but he only pretends to likes you because you 're rich . ), 
  for me the most striking and obvious differences for daily life are both transport related . 
  quality and frequency of public transport . 
  walking to work and to the shops . 
  workplaces are a bit different and much more subtle : i 've done my fair share of contract based skilled work all over the place , and of the places ive worked , american labour/trade unions are a very different beast to what im used to in britain , australia or elsewhere in europe . 
  ( union dues , employee rank , blue vs white etc etc. ), 
  it seems all so much more aggressive . 
  imo the british labour force is much better looked after and so the unions are much less assertive because perhaps they are not so necessary . 
  im pretty sure vans are included in these figures as we do n't have * that * many white cars . 
  we 're not in the desert . 
  france is under special emergency measures at the moment with extra police checkpoints at borders . 
  you likely will be required to carry your id to cross * certain * international borders . 
  this only 100 % valid non-eu id is your passport . 
  same latitude as newfoundland and labrador . 
  most of britain is further north than nova scotia . 
  do n't forget pikeys, 
  striking and industrial action . 
  traitor, 
  its nothing to do with the queen . 
  most americans have never travelled to britain ( less than half even have a passport ) , and so the only brits they have ever met are the ones wealthy enough to travel to the us . 
  [ it 's much cheaper to fly to spain .
