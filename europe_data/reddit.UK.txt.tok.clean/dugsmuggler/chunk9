  * `` is n't it terrible about losing to the germans at our national sport ?

  estonia has the e citizenship . 
  all government services are easily done online and digitally signed . 
  not sure on cost but estonia is not the most expensive place in the world . 
  time to put on your guinness branded beer goggles . 
  considering that the official name is [ `` the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e1/ukpassport-cover.jpg ) , everything that applies to the great britain part does n't automatically apply to the `` overseas colony '' part . 
  as opposed to what other type of victory ? 
  i just looked at his comment history - hilarious . 
  * england is not europe , it is england ... *, 
  since when is europe a country ? 
  twice !, 
  an excellent answer . 
  its also worth noting that the police here do not carry guns as part of normal police work ( except in northern ireland ) , and only a small percentage of the force are fully trained in firearms . 
  the high-profile policing of airports and major rail stations are just about the only places you will see armed police patrolling outside of ni . 
  the ban on handguns was a response from public pressure after the [ dunblane shooting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunblane_school_massacre ) . 
  when i was working in estoina , there was a facebook post going around with a list somthing like `` you know you 're estonian when ... '' on one of them there was `` you know the names of the 5 black guys who live in tallinn '' i think now , its not quite so funny for some estonians anymore . 
  dont forget , you wont find many americans reading , say , polish or danish language news outlets , whereas many ( younger ) poles or danes could easily read american news outlets . 
  its not exactly a two way street . 
  not fixed . 
  just a pissing contest to see who has the biggest campaign budget . 
  thats a big assumption you 've got there . 
  1.8 mil expats ( less pensioners ) *** assumed *** in work ** or ** study . 
  i was specifically talking about migrant workers , not pensioners or students or family members . 
  there were over 3 million eu born residents in the uk in 2015 , and i 'll bet there is nowhere near the same number of retirees from the eu pensioning it up here . 
  the showing of two fingers to the enemy was an insult used by the english longbowmen as a taunt to the french in the [ hundred years ' war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hundred_years'_war ) [ the back of the hand is shown ] ( https://bshistorian.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/luttrell-archers.jpg ? ), 
  `` this salute dates back to the english longbowman who fought the french during the hundred years war ( 1337 -- 1453 ) . 
  the french hated the english archers who used the longbow with such devastating effect . 
  any english archers who were caught by the french had their index and middle fingers chopped off from their right hand - a terrible penalty for an archer . 
  this led to the practice of the english archers , especially in siege situations , taunting their french enemy with their continued presence by raising their two fingers in the ` two-fingered salute ' meaning `` you have n't cut off my fingers ! '', 
  churchill 's was coined by him to mean `` v for victory '' , he changed after the war . 
  im british wife is estonian . 
  they are pretty well received in estonia , a small nato country on the russian border with a very small standing army ( compulsory national service ) and no airforce . 
  we have some usaf staff and families stationed near where we live in england and we do n't really see or hear much of them . 
  force everyone to communicate with me only in ** my ** mother tongue, 
  a proper englishman never allows the spoon to touch the cup . 
  try `` hospital bills '' . 
  that 's * really * american . 
  you 're going to have to add '' * always * knows the best way to do somthing '' to that . 
  i rest my case . 
  i have n't assumed your age . 
  i can simply read your maturity . 
  the key points here are :  humorous and emphatic effect . 
  highly subjective , but as a straw poll based on reddit votes , you 're out of luck here . 
  and second , the retort of oscar wilde is not the original quote . 
  it 's his arrogant and over inflated opinion of himself and not an actual measure of intelligence . 
  quite appropriate really . 
  i 'm well aware of what sarcasm is - described as * `` the lowest form of wit '' * i know how to use it , but more importantly , * when * to use it . 
  i do n't need lecturing on my mother tongue by a pre-pubecent italian troll , naming himself apparently in denial about the factual realities about his capitol city 's history . 
  if you want to crack jokes about deaths , go back to 4chan , or whatever pathetic hole you crawled from , your `` comedy '' is clearly not welcome here . 
  joseph stalin . 
  neither sarcastic nor funny . 
  there is nothing sarcastic ( or remotely funny for that matter , ) about the deaths of large numbers of civilians . 
   we are from mozambique ( africa ) . 
   freest country in the world . 
  that 's a stretch . 
  try reading next time . 
  you are literally 7.3 x more likely to be killed by a policeman in america than by a terrorist in europe . 
  figures for 2015 : killed by police in the us - 1207 [ source ] ( http://killedbypolice.net/ ) killed by terrorists in the eu - 165 ( of which 157 were in paris . ), 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_the_european_union ) ( dates for 2015 near the bottom of the 1st table . ), 
  ** do n't believe the hype . 
  for instance the extreme right bnp ( racist skinheads ) get a share on the bbc . 
  share of access to state run tv is based on past successes in the polls there is quite a big issue surrounding the way the votes are counted on the ground , the old constituencys boundaries , and the `` first past the post '' system are quite contentious , as many feel the game is not fair . 
  ( it 's hard to comment specifically with out showing bias ), 
  i can only speak for the uk . 
  we do n't have a rigid 2 party system , although traditionally conservative and labour are the two main ones , we have liberal democrat ( shared power with con in the last parliament ) ukip a relatively new party who want out of the eu , snp - scottish nationalists . 
  and so on . 
  we have very strict financing laws . 
  paid for advertising on billboards and magazines etc has to be declared and is subject to clearly defined limits . 
  the bbc has allocated slots for party political broadcasts all year round and extra party election broadcasts in an election year . 
  these are shared out between the candidates/parties . 
  the other broadcasters follow similar rules . 
  basically you ca n't just buy your way onto the airwaves like you can in america . 
  campaign donatiors have to be declared and proxy donations are forbidden . 
  is it perfect ? 
  are there issues and cause for complaint ? 
  yes . 
  but i think every briton agrees our system is far better than america 's, 
  i received my salary and paid my mortgage . 
  no my point was that an air-route does not need to be physically constructed . 
  and specifically that whether the airports are 100 or 1000 miles apart , the infrastructure costs the same to build . 
  2x runways . 
  a rail route is more expensive because the infrastructure has to be planned and built in order to be operational , and the 100 vs 1000 miles analogy will cost 10 times as much . 
  yes the air planning will be 10 times as long , but that cost is insignificant when compared to the planning and physical constructing of 1000 miles of track . 
  the rail costs are multiplied by the time from planning inception to operational service - and multiplied by the cost of inflexibility - the lack of ability to cancel and plan new routes as air traffic can be re routed with-out having to fire up the bulldozers . 
  there is far more cost to building railways than air ways , because railways are planned and physically built , and air way-points are just planned . 
  yes exactly . 
  railways are more expensive because you have to build through places like this in order to build city centre stations . 
  thank you for proving my point . 
  the heathrow expansion you quoted is not likely to happen because of the build-over problems i have highlighted . 
  ( if indeed you do work for the civils consultancy you claim to , you would know the gatwick project is the far more likely candidate . 
  however , i digress . ), 
  no amount of air way-point planning for a dot in the south atlantic is ever going to cost more than building a railway . 
  the skys are empty , and any `` infratructure '' only exists digitally . 
   # 18bn to build one runway at heathrow . 
  [ because that plan requires burying a 3 mile stretch of the m25 , removing a small town , draining orlitts lake and diverting colne brook . 
  ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_13215/img/heathrow_proposed_expansion_976_flat.png?v=1 ) the tunnel would be just south of the m4 , that section is 6 lanes + hard shoulder in either direction - 14 lanes wide . 
  and would have to be strong enough to build the runway over it .
