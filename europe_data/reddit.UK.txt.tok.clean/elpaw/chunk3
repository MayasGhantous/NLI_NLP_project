  should hs2 be on there as a green dotted line ? 
  no nation state , but the nation exists . 
  be careful what you wish for ; that something might be vacationing in a neighbouring country . 
   isle of man -  australia what was that , like one person ? 
  i 'm surprised it was n't uk, 
   is in eu  is in the eu  is n't part of the eu  wants to get in the eu  is n't in eu  is n't in the eu  is in eu  is in eu  leave the eu they are obsessed with the eu, 
  bad food ?

  have they even tried our [ roast chicken with yorkshire pudding ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/yu0n5/roast_chicken_w_yorkshire_pudding/ ) ? 
  only car piracy is stealing, 
  the plural of child is children, 
  poland is number 26 : http://www.prosperity.com/#!/ranking, 
  you dropped this in your quote :  for one reason only i do n't suck . 
  you suck at writing english . 
  you said that he 's the only reason russia has been punching above its weight . 
  that is high praise . 
  you are praising him above everyone else in russia, 
  he specifically asked  when was the ** last time ** i praised our beloved president so that 's what i gave, 
  you said russia has been kicking above its weight for one reason only , that reason being putin i do n't know what shitty backwards orwellian land you live in , but that is clearly praise , and not a loose definition either . 
  here komrad : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/48rtj6/public_support_for_putin_to_serve_another_term/d0mhkmj enjoy your beets . 
  i reread carefull cordaf 's whole commenting history and can not find a single thing that is n't about russia or praising putin . 
  there was one post talking about fifa corruption , but no , even that is about the 2018 wc in russia, 
  ok , carry on believing he is a champion against corruption . 
  let 's see if he arrests his friends and family, 
  i hope that russian redditors will finally admit that putin is totally corrupt , and not some champion against corruption as they always claim . 
  not surprising to see transylvania there, 
  but today is only the 19th of march, 
  here are all today 's covers : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-35922567, 
  how many borders are there inside russia ? 
  shhhhh who told you about the plan ? 
  i bet it was that german head of state that we have, 
  for now ... 
  what do you mean year 15 ? 
  this has been around for decades, 
  is that because of adopting the euro ? 
  relative searches ? 
  the dutch love incest too ? 
  i pray for poland, 
  with the free market defining poor performance , you get the vw situation . 
  massive purge in 2002, 
  so you 're saying this is a state secret ? 
  admitting the state is directly involved in cheating sports , just like in soviet times ? 
  does russia still have that estonian citizen they kidnapped at the border a few years back ? 
  it 's just after the group stages , so england will probably be out . 
  wales will be still in it though, 
  i know slovenia used to be united with chechnia , until the volvate revolution . 
  read this as :  man , arrested for facebook , posts about syrian refugees in scotland . 
  i was very confused . 
  most surprising for me is turkey using proto-slavic roots . 
  that 's one way to get more people voting to leave . 
  what 's the holiday ? 
  carnival ? 
  just the culture i guess ; men inherited from their parents , women were married off to men who inherited from their parents . 
  the whole of europe used to be like that decades ago . 
  greece , are you even trying ? 
  that 's a word for word copy of the bbc sentence . 
  who is plagiarising whom ? 
  not swede ? 
  he 's shutting down his enemy oligarchs . 
  his friend oligarchs mysteriously remain in power . 
  lol poles confusing gender and sexuality, 
  i know , that 's why i said `` similar '' and not `` exactly '', 
  depositing radioactive particles over a wide area ? 
  yeah , totally retarded to compare it to a dirty bomb . 
  what would you compare it to ? 
  fukushima maybe ? 
  i ca n't think of anything else to compare it to . 
   well it 's clearly assassination and not a terrorism . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/alexander-litvinenko-the-man-who-solved-his-own-murder  tests were to show massive alpha radiation contamination in the second cubicle on the left -- 2,600 counts per second on the door , 200 on the flush handle . 
  further sources of polonium were found on and below the gents ' hand-dryer , at over 5,000 counts per second . 
  there was what scientists called `` full-scale deflection '' -- readings so high they were off the scale . 
   polonium was a miasma , a creeping fog . 
  it was found inside the dishwasher , on the floor , till , a coffee strainer handle . 
  there were traces on bottles of martini and tia maria behind the bar , the ice-cream scoop , a chopping board . 
  it turned up on chairs -- with large alpha radiation readings from where the three russians sat -- and the piano stool . 
  whoever sent lugovoi and kovtun to london must have known of the risks to others . 
  apparently they did n't care . 
  this was not just assasination ; with radiatioactivity left behind over a wide area , it was similar to a dirty bomb, 
  `` in 1901 , the liberal deputy luis de armi\u00f1an bought up the question in parliament : ` could poland possibly be the catalanists ' role model ? 
  ' , the poles being famous at the time for their struggle for independence . 
  to this day , the main insult word for a catalan is ` polaco ' -- pole '', 
   nd is there a reason why poland 's text is black ? 
  probably to differentiate it from the light landmass underneath the text, 
   you do n't happen to be from the us , do you ? 
  spelling defence with an 's ' , yes . 
  does that mean it will be actually landing on saturn , and you have to get a bus the rest of the way ? 
  it 's probably a reaction to communism , with everyone going full blown conservative and religious, 
  i think i saw the christmas lads down the local weatherspoons last night, 
  not to turkey . 
  or mongolia, 
  i want to get off mr grexit 's wild ride, 
  if it 's so cheap , why did n't putin 's money help fn ?
