  yeah no wonder we do n't agree . 
  you go by people , i go by books . 
  but the books go by people . 
   until the dictionary says differently , words mean what they mean . 
  ignorance is no excuse  then why would the dictionary ever change ? 
  what are dictionary writers to you - some sort clueless authority that misunderstands how language works but still gets to ordain how it ought to be ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  and besides all that , if you truly do go by the book , and wo n't listen to reason , go and look up the definition of anti-semitism in any dictionary . 
   again , i 'm not talking about word meanings in ye olde days , but in current books and dictionaries right now . 
  right , but there were books in ye olden days too , and the definitions have shifted between now and then . 
  were the first people who expanded the definition of asia wrong ? 
  if so , when did they stop being wrong ? 
  i think these are trick questions - `` right '' and `` wrong '' are meaningless categories when applied to language . 
  what matters is only `` is this understood by speakers of the language '' or `` is this not understood by speakers of the language ''  i agree on the use of america though . 
  i avoid referring to people from the us as americans - when i talk specifically about people from the us , that is , because i would n't want to include canadians , mexicans , etc. 
  i just say usaers , simple enough . 
  i know nobody else does it , but i do n't care . 
  when i say usaer nobody is the least bit confused . 
  you seem to recognise here that being understood is what counts , not `` correctness '' . 
   if you said a law got adopted in europe but only meant belarus , it would be weird to connotatively suggest it pertains to the whole continent . 
  but that 's because no one understands `` europe '' to mean `` belarus '' so you 'd be conflating two different categories in the minds of your hearers , confusing them . 
   this whole ` public understanding ' thing is like people using the word ` peruse ' to mean ` read briefly ' . 
  just because a lot of people use a word incorrectly does n't change its meaning in the dictionary . 
  yes it does , and that 's happened many times through the history of every language . 
  old dictionaries will be missing words and have slightly different definitions of some words than dictionaries today . 
  why ? 
  because dictionaries do n't define a language , they describe it , so as the language changes over time the dictionaries that describe it need to change , or they are crap dictionaries . 
  i 'd compare dictionaries to wikipedia . 
  if wikipedia disagrees with the world it describes , which is wrong - wikipedia , or the world ? 
  wikipedia would always be wrong , and need correcting . 
  in fact wikipedia is only of value if it faithfully describes the world . 
  if wikipedia tried to change the world so it `` made more sense '' by altering articles , it would cease to be useful for understanding our world . 
  if wikipedia tried to keep the world as it was last time wikipedia was updated by refusing to alter any articles , wikipedia would cease to be useful beyond merely a record of the past . 
  if the dictionary says `` english people think this word means that '' but english people * do n't * think it means that , what use is the dictionary ? 
  what i am describing here are the competing linguistic views `` descriptivism '' vs `` prescriptivism '' . 
  descriptivists study what language is and does , and try to describe it . 
  prescriptivists try to prescript `` good '' and `` correct '' language . 
  and dictionary writers ( and almost all modern linguists ) actually are all descriptivists , they view their goal as cataloguing and describing a language faithfully , rather than acting as some authority on how people `` ought '' to speak . 
   language is simple , it 's just that people use words ( and add prefixes to words ) without fully knowing what they mean . 
  it 's totally possible to not know what the common usage of a word is ( though different dialects are a thing i do n't want to ignore ) - but that 's not what 's going on with `` asia '' , `` america '' or `` anti-semite '' - the common usage can not be `` incorrect '' . 
  the people who started using anti-semite to refer to their hatred of jews knew exactly what they were doing . 
  they were trying to disguise their hatred of a people as some object fact about their `` race '' . 
  despite it 's ugly and misleading origins , the word has stuck , is understood properly , and simply means what it means . 
  can i point you to a similar example , so you see what i mean ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_continent_name_etymologies#asia `` asia '' used to refer to the east coast of the aegean sea , then to the entire anatolian peninsula ( modern day turkey ) , and now to the entire continent . 
  but `` asia '' still refers to the anatolian peninsula , just it now tends to be called `` asia minor '' . 
  i believe what you are doing is the equivalent of saying `` it 's wrong to use the word asia to refer to the continent , the word asia has historically referred to the anatolian peninsula , so it should be primarily referred to that way '' . 
  or how about `` american '' which historically in english has , and in many languages still does refer to the entire `` new world '' , but in english now pretty much exclusively refers to the usa ? 
  if we were to say something about `` america '' whilst referring only to the us are we wrong ? 
  maybe a difference is that semitic still means what it means , not `` jew '' , despite anti-semitic changing . 
  anti-semitic does n't follow pattern than lots of other words do - for most words that begin with `` anti '' you can usually understand what they are reffering to if you remove the prefix anti- . 
  i 'm just saying `` anti-semitic '' is a weird exception that rule - an anti-semite is ** not ** opposed to semites they are opposed to * jews * . 
  it would perhaps be more convenient if languages were nice and simple and there were n't exceptions to rules that generally make sense , but they do n't !, 
  words mean what they are understood to mean , not what makes sense for them to mean , and so anti-semitism means anti-jew . 
  semite does n't suddenly mean jew , as you point out - it 's just a word that is a weird exception to the `` add an anti- '' rule , thanks to a historical quirk . 
  it 's not a misnomer - it 's just how language ends up some times - word 's meanings change over time maybe to something different to what it originally meant , but that does n't mean the new meaning is `` wrong '' somehow . 
  knowing the etymology of the word does n't mean you know how it 's understood today . 
  etymology =\\ = dictionary, 
  i think honesty in this context means openness rather than truthfulness . 
  so more like caning ? 
  may well be !, 
  i 'm thinking in terms of the old british naval punishment . 
  350 lashes for an old man is probably death . 
  also , right to a family life is in the european convention of human rights . 
  the dichotomy between `` religious '' and `` non-religious '' reasoning makes no sense - it only makes a whiff of sense if you 're not religious because it appeals to `` us and them '' , but frankly atheism or secular humanism and christianity have much more in common than jainism and christianity do . 
  as for common sense reasons to be pro-life , that 's easy - 1 it 's the safest way to treat any situation where you could well be killing a human and 2 every other way of viewing the value of human life is inconsistent with really basic morality - inherent value to human life is simply the only way to explain our morality . 
  the problem is that the reasons pro-life think abortion should be illegal is the same as the reasons they think murder should be illegal . 
  telling people to `` keep their views of life to themselves '' * is * telling them to stand by as terrible acts of injustice go on . 
  murder is not a private matter - it is a matter of social justice . 
  if citizens feel murder is not being dealt with by the government then of course they should try to change their government . 
  if people disagree about what is murder then what you have is an ongoing public debate , that will only be settled if people agree . 
  if it 's settled any other means , then some group is tolerating what they feel to be a terrible injustice . 
  that 's not a good thing . 
  you should not try to end the debate this way - people should care about the lives of others . 
  ok , but now 1 . 
  that 's a completely different point to what you 've been making the whole time . 
  does that mean you agree that enforcing culture is n't good ? 
  or are you just trying another angle ? 
  is there any evidence that people are using burkas to commit crimes ? 
  with terrorism particularly anonymity does n't seem a priority . 
  people do n't have to justify their decisions to you . 
  if it does n't harm people or cause a problem , why on earth would you want it outlawed ? 
  you might not like it , but that 's different to it being outlawed . 
  the government should only interfere when the stakes are higher than arbitrary cultural or religious issues . 
  you might see the sense in yak 's milk and not in burkas , and that 's fine , but why does your being able to make sense of something matter ? 
  things should be acceptable unless they cause a big problem , it should n't be that something has to be justified to be permissable . 
  so , if they actually can be shown to be a security threat as people claim , then that 's a good sort of reason . 
  `` i do n't like it '' or `` it 's religious '' are bad reasons to get the government involved . 
   the same old naive rules . 
  aka the bedrock of what you 're trying to preserve . 
  just concede defeat and move on if that is what you 're trying to do . 
   you should n't voice your religious head and what suppose to be okay seriously ? 
  depending on their religious views , people should n't take part in the democratic process ? 
   burqa/burkini is neither okay nor acceptable in our society and nothing will change that , do n't like it , simple - leave the country . 
  as i said , you are blurring the lines between what is culturally not accepted and what is legally not accepted . 
  since you are just repeating what you said earlier , i 'll repeat my response : `` it 's not european culture to eat insects or drink yak 's milk but making that illegal is unnecessary and authoritarian . '', 
  sorry , are you saying they should n't be allowed to voice their views in a democratic system ? 
  was your bleating about `` european culture and values '' totally hypocritical ? 
   such clothes as burqa/burkini are already an authoritarian way to oppress women . 
  `` authoritarian '' is referring to state authority , not any other authority .
