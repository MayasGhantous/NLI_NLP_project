the only italian people i know of round here run a small pizza place out of a market . 
  best pizza in town . 
  more italians please . 
  seriously though , i 'm not sure if we even have a national costume . 
  rightfully ours ... because reasons . 
  true , but given the * quality posting * already apparent i would say we 're off to a bad start . 
  i still feel like this thread solves one problem by creating a larger one . 
  now the only place immigration can be discussed is here , which is cluttered with much more brazen vitriol than any threads previously . 
  we 're now unable to have a sensible conversation about immigration because this thread will be constantly brigaded by racist subreddits , much more than any thread in / r/europe before . 
  now when anyone tries to speak against the megathread the mods will be able to say `` look how scummy the discussion is there , we could n't possibly allow that back into the main community '' , when everyone knows it was never this bad before at all . 
  edit : if anything it is attracting more fascists to this sub than before . 
  it would be unfair to base the tone of the whole discussion on immigrants thus far on what you see in this thread . 
  as soon as it was made it was basicly a giant neon sign saying `` hey , brigade me , brigade me !! '', 
  i would much rather have conversations about immigration in a more moderate environment such as this , rather than having to turn to another community which is less ... civil . 
  trying to stifle speech about such a popular topic because you do n't agree with the consensus is unreasonable . 
  maybe we should take the liberty of creating a `` safe zone '' in libya , since it is currently split between many tumultuous factions similar to syria ? 
  i mean , according to this map a large section of the coast there is actually controlled by isis : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/libyan_civil_war.png, 
  `` oh jesus , liberland is retarded ? '', 
  it 's probably just a cultural difference between us and johnny foreigner . 
  i do support further european integration , but we still have our differences . 
  a small clip around the lug-holes always worked for me . 
  i accidentally read the title as `` most common form of birth control in each swedish municipality . '', 
  `` finland is a birth control . . ? '',

  that will happen after we start worshiping the dark lord and invade the undying lands to the west , to obtain immortality . 
  i disagree with their policies about the armed forces , energy , crime and punishment , and scientific research . 
  that , and the fact that many of my peers ( students ) all go around babbling `` the lib dems betrayed us , better vote for the greens instead ! '', 
  despite knowing very little about their actual policies . 
  i see them more as a protest party , who have very little ability to actually govern , their main purpose being to split the labour / lib dem votes , giving the conservatives more wins . 
  labour , although i prefer the lib dems . 
  i 'm voting tactically as the only two parties who have a decent chance of winning are the tories or labour . 
  i 'm worried that the labour vote will be split by the recent support for the green party , and they will not be fptp . 
  i very much dislike the greens . 
  not wrong . 
   / r/ukipparty united kingdom independence party party ? 
  the queen still holds the title duke of normandy , since we still have control over the channel islands .

  furthermore all the taxes and repression that lead to the american war were formulated by parliament , not the king . 
  it literally took an invasion to make them more unstable than greece ? 
  i never realised how bad it was before . 
  but it does n't look anything like a tiger !, 
  i think it 's called giraffe bread now . 
  we 're just holding our breath for the next big p\u00e6do scandal to d\u00e9but . 
  well , it beats morris dancing .

  no no , reduced fertility causes kinder eggs ... 
  instead of bearing children european women are now laying chocolate eggs . 
  i do n't want us to go though ; _ ;, 
  in old english we had the word `` w\u00e6ld '' , which is still used for an area in kent today : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weald article also explains it has a different origin to wood or woodland . 
  i mostly play ck2 because reasons , but i 'll be happy to give this a shot . 
  hopefully i do n't fail too much haha edit : failed badly . 
  so the turks are still in iraq ? 
  i thought they had to leave a few weeks ago ? 
  about two months in prison . 
  http://mentalfloss.com/article/22425/queen-owns-swans-and-other-swan-stories  `` in 2003 , a man in llandudno , wales , was sentenced to two months in prison after killing a mute swan . '', 
  in the uk all mute swans and sturgeon are the property of the queen . 
  killing them is treason ( although i think the punishment has actually been lowered in recent times ) .

  i find the best polandballs to be the ones with really shitty quality art . 
  well most of the fighting in the winter war was in 1939/1940 . 
  by 1945 the soviet army was quite a different beast . 
  they had already defeated the romanian army at stalingrad so i 'm not sure if they would have been as fortunate as the finns . 
  do you think romania could have beaten the soviets and got a better peace deal , realistically ? 
  [ i 'm sure this will go down well .

  the nationalist party is the true ruler of all china !, 
  why aye !,

  in an independent scotland , would i be able to get a scottish passport by claiming ancestry from my scottish grandfather ? 
  ( a system similar to what the irish have . ), 
  they stopped in a different city every 2 or 3 days , in the end it was about 2 months of travelling, 
  i recently had two friends go from newcastle to hong kong by train ( albeit with a slight detour by car in kazakhstan ) .

  pannonia belongs to the gepids , magyars out !, 
  beer is essentially worthless unless it is brewed by a reclusive monastic order . 
  yeah , this one was a bit confusing for me . 
  some sources give it as just meaning army-ford , some take it further and say it is where armies would cross into wales to `` harry '' or `` plunder '' the welsh . 
  hull !, 
  got me thinking , do we derive the name of a ship 's hull from the old word for a seed shell ? 
  my source was the online etymology dictionary : http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=plymouth, 
  bridges are usually connected to roads , what if you are walking in the countryside ? 
  sure , few people do this anymore but we still have a word for it . 
  like we have the word `` smithing '' even though few people actually `` smith '' . 
  plymouth was named after the river plym , which was in turn named after the adjacent suburb of plympton , which means plum-tree-farm . 
  it 's still in use today , and is in the dictionary !, 
  a ford is just a shallow area of water that is easier to walk or drive through .

  added to descriptor . 
  could be , my source is wikipedia : york is directly derived from the old norse j\u00f3rv\u00edk ( ` horse bay ' ) . 
  however , jorvik was the norse interpretation of the old english eoforw\u012bc ( ` boar town ' ) , which itself was an interpretation of the roman name for york , eboracum . 
  this is in turn derived from a brythonic name , eboracon probably meaning place of yew trees . 
  you are correct !, 
  my mistake was mixing up the city and the castle .
