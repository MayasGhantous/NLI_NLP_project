this is seriously fucked up, 
   if i had my way you would be kicked out of the uk assuming scotland does n't want to leave this godawful sinking ship lol  left to be the debt-ridden resource poor country scotland was destined to be might be rough at first , but we 'll get the help we need from eu because unlike england we 're not xenophobic wankers, 
  we 've never had a quota and will never get a quota seeing as england made sure of that . 
  it is n't your privilege to tell other countries what to do anymore . 
  do n't tell people america is the greatest country in the world, 
  piss off , the uk always wanted a special status . 
  and they had a special status . 
  fucking england ruining things for everyone else . 
   `` we have to think what we did wrong and what we should do better . '', 
  sure , there 's things that need fixing , but let 's stop kissing england 's ass for being pretentious as fuck, 
  hah and they say people in the north are n't fertile, 
  well how about we help ukraine become stable enough to join nato and the eu ? 
  even if only out of interest if not just plain old good intentions, 
  had to look at your history and my oh my . . a literal nazi ladies and gentleman . 
  my god you 're a wanker, 
  so much ignorance in one single post . 
  no , that would be england . 
  we 'll see about that . 
  you spelled england wrong, 
  you do n't say, 
  the english are always hypocrites, 
  the reasons to leave you just keep on coming . 
  thanks , mate, 
  good . 
  better bugger off of this sinking ship . 
  eu , here we come, 
  lol, 
  downright cunts you are, 
  do n't cry for me argentina :(, 
  oh i 'm sure, 
  i had to look up a random source rn . 
  mind you a random source proved right for scotland . 
  i 've seen a map that divided ni , england and scotland and showed england out and scotland and ni in , but i ca n't find it . 
  will make a edit if i do . 
  scotland wants remain with [ 54 ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/06/britain-s-eu-referendum ), 
  mate , i do n't think you know what dictatorship means, 
  no , england 's the only part where brexit is wanted , scotland and northern ireland will vote for remain i know what i 'll vote but i 'm good either way because even if they do choose to leave , we finally get to leave them, 
  yeah because not french kissing england 's arse is wanting them to leave . 
  i 'm scottish first and foremost i n d e p e n d e n c e, 
  honestly i vote we rename the sub to brexit cause it is n't about europe anymore . 
  everyone 's too far up england 's arse, 
  say the same about the russian hooligans and try to mean it , 
  cry me a river lads, 
  what about the government ?

  yeah . 
  there 's a comedy that came out on june 23 last year that was terrific , but damn i forgot its name . 
  it was hysterical . 
  it 's called being emotionally constipated . 
  oh , come on , do n't forget us . 
   their beaches are full of stones instead of sand . 
  which is why we end up in spain . 
  that and the pollution . 
   i found the scottish to be in general more friendly than the english . 
  it 's because we 're vastly superior to them . 
   loch ness exist right ? 
  yes . 
  after the eu referendum we decided that we 'll wake it up so he can eat the english if we do n't get another independence referendum . 
   suckers for believing shit if it 's said with a posh upperclass accent . 
  now , now ... do n't put us all in the same pot . 
  do n't even get me started . 
  it 's your professionalism that i respect . 
  lol, 
  you know what they say : fool me once , shame on you . 
  fool me twice , shame on me . 
   fat  europe pick one . 
  i know it has nothing to do with the new rule , but can the newbies know something about the mods ? 
  do you enjoy long walks on the beach ? 
  and of course we should listen to that inbred asshole who looks like trump . 
   eu does n't want to lose a major partner . 
  the eu ca n't afford to lose anymore members so uk will not get anything other than what it deserves . 
  no , thank you . 
  it will not collapse . 
  especially in the face of this british empire wet dream . 
  oh for fuck 's sake , i thought dreaming of the empire days was just for stupid brits , but apparently there will be lobbying . 
  kill it with fire before it lays eggs !, 
  ah , yes , the concept of * sovereignty * is very important to the uk . 
  * submits application *, 
  * holy fuck !, 
  * i know some guys who you 'd get along with very well !, 
  hungary is n't even a net contributor . 
   anti-uk obviously . 
  especially after the vote . 
  you can move to england and suck up to the likes of boris johnson and nigel farage for all i care  being pro-eu helps your agenda god forbid anyone actually likes the eu but maybe this time we 'll do it right . 
  get independence and apply for eu membership, 
  good thing there are more of us than you think, 
   i would feel very awkward to live in sweden if swedes did n't have the same rights as myself , in the uk . 
  england does n't feel the same as you tho . 
   but what do you make of the leave voters in your country , are they xenephobic wankers too ? 
  some were xenophobic wankers , some were misinformed , some voted leave for other reasons . 
  but truth is , scotland did n't face a growth in xenophobic crimes . 
  i 'll let you guess which place did,
