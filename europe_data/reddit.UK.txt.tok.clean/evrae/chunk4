  you mean the migrants who are fleeing from the crazed maniacs ? 
  i 'm sure they are a * massive * threat / s, 
   although the scales used for selling and all labelling is in metric , you ask for a pound of mince beef , or a quarter-pound of sliced ham . 
  nobody understands metric in those contexts . 
  speak for yourself . 
  i would n't have a clue how much a pound is , but i know what 250g of mince , or a kilo of flour looks like . 
  is n't crimea one of the most fertile regions in europe ? 
  if so , that might have something to do with it . 
  i know i was . 
  idiotic 14-year-old me believed that reasons blair and bush had for going to war were bollocks . 
  but i also felt that toppling dictators was a great idea . 
  wow , i was an idiot ... 
  i 've read that modern dictionary attacks are aware of the xkcd method ( and common letter-number substitutions ) , so it does n't give you all that much more security, 
  well , stoneface vimes is a pretty minor character . 
  it looks somehow soulless to me . 
  the completely flat frontages , perfectly kept grass , identical window boxes . 
  it 's like somebody has decided ` this place * will * be picturesque and perfect ' . 
  you do get some advantages . 
  one that leaps to mind is that since the centre of gravity is below the rail , it is far harder for the thing to come off the rails !, 
  a conventional railway needs rails that are fairly widely spaced , and the spacing needs to be kept constant . 
  that makes for a much bulkier structure . 
  the biggest downside i can think of is that it can only run specially made trains , as opposed to the same rolling stock as every other railway in the country . 
  all in all , i doubt that the advantages really amount to all that much , otherwise we 'd see them elsewhere . 
  it does look cool though , and that makes up for a lot !, 
   last but not least , there can be several vat rates . 
  vat on essentials for example is 6 % in the netherlands , there 's also a 0 % rate ( ( house ) construction/renovation use to be 0 % due to the crisis ) all the rest is 21 % . 
  and those differences in rates can lead to bizarre court cases such as the one over whether a jaffa cake is a biscuit or a cake . 
  some of the best cider i 've had is breton cider - it slips down so well !, 
  there is also the possibility ( looking you , python ) that the result is an integer . 
  so you have ( 1/2 .5 = = 0 ) . 
  really annoying when it catches you out !, 
   the french one is also wrong . 
  they would find that comment hilarious . 
  i know from experience that you can rustle les jimmies by declaring that english cheese is better . 
  i do n't buy it - surely this sort of thing only really works if it is actually plausible that someone would hold the opinion . 
  ah , good point . 
  is it really five mistakes when altering one of them makes two of the others factual ? 
  for example :  one of the many reasons / u / _ hopped _ is glad that we were ** given ** the ** elgin marbles ** . 
  that one change reduces it to two errors , which might imply that there were only three errors originally . 
  alternatively :  one of the many reasons the world is sad that we were ** given ** the ** elgin marbles ** . 
  again , a single change brings things down to two errors . 
  either way , i can '' t agree that ` many ' was an error , since whatever position one takes on the matter there will be many reasons for holding it . 
  so i think i would say that there are at most three errors : ` the world is glad ' , ` were given ' , and ` elgin ' . 
  i would also argue that the use of ` elgin marbles ' is n't exactly incorrect , since it is the most commonly used identifier in english . 
  their acquisition by elgin is also a part of their history , so it serves as a useful distinction from the items that he did n't get hold of ( presuming there are any ) . 
  is this really true ? 
  my impression was that bridges known as devil 's bridge tend to be of a rather different design - a wide span , and quite a thin layer of stone making up the span . 
  i 'm also not so sure that the construction of the aqueducts was any great mystery . 
  medieval europeans built plenty of large-scale constructions ( churches , castles etc ) . 
  i do n't think there 's anything to them that could n't be managed by medieval architects other than perhaps the logistics . 
  little known fact - slough actually rhymes with fluff . 
  they probably would - the economist is pretty consistent in its principles . 
  you almost certainly do need one . 
  the thing is that while it is necessary , it probably is n't sufficient . 
  a traditional antivirus is based on the antivirus company pushing out updates to a list of known attack signatures , and the software on the endpoint blocking files that match those signatures . 
  this works great if it is a known attacker , but if you are hit before the signature is pushed out to the endpoints , you 're stuffed . 
  the more modern method of malware protection involves a hybrid approach . 
  as well as the signatures , it will also look at other things . 
  for instance it might check file writes , and if it detects a succession of files being encrypted by an unrecognised process it might say ` ahah !, 
  block it and revert those file changes ! ' . 
  behaviour-based detection will protect you even before the signatures are published . 
  the white population of london is ~ 60 % , so this would happen ~ 8 % of the time . 
  i ca n't exactly claim to be a gunsmith , but would n't a ' 3-round burst ' system be mechanically a lot more complicated than either semi-auto or full-auto ? 
  yet they are both born of the same way of thinking - show that you 're rich and powerful by covering everything in gold . 
  the nouveau riche try to imitate the style with varying degrees of success , but i do n't think that the original is really any more tasteful just because it is a bit older . 
  i really hope he was just being modest , because otherwise what he did was really rather reckless . 
  while it ended up stopping the malware , in principle it could have done something completely different . 
  admittedly it 's hard to think of something * worse * than flooding a network with remote execution attacks , but still ... 
  i suppose that if you are aligned with a politician , then you will be inclined to go along with their recommendations . 
  that 's the reasoning behind representative democracy , that you elect someone who has the time to make an informed decision on issues . 
  with the french system it especially makes sense , since the options you have in the second round might both be very different from anything you would choose when given a choice . 
  so almost immediately after the results for the first round were in , most of the other candidates came out to essentially say `` macron 's policies might be very different from what we want , but it 's better to vote for him than a fascist '' . 
   frexit i have grudgingly got used to ` brexit ' , but that is a word i never wish to see again !, 
  some people who work manual labour do - they need it to get through the day !, 
  it 's more the other way round i think - groups that are culturally more unionist are also culturally protestant , while culturally republican groups are culturally catholic . 
  because religious orientation is an identifier of sorts , it has acquired an importance it would n't otherwise . 
  ni is more religious than other parts of the uk , and probably more so that the roi . 
  but the depth of religious observance , identity etc is , at this point , most likely * due * to the political difficulties and divides . 
  interestingly , cameron did n't want to cut the eu budget - it was forced on him by labour and some tory backbenchers ,, 
  i 'm surprised that the overhead power cables still have n't been replaced . 
  speed restrictions do make sense if the older cables do n't cope well with expansion . 
  but there have been several blocks on liverpool street in the past few years which should have been ample opportunity to replace the wiring . 
  i wish they would rewrite it so that it * did * focus on the practicalities of living here . 
  anything would be better than memorising meaningless statistics . 
  my priority would be athena , followed by ngo . 
  xmm-newton is pretty good , but we always want better . 
  there will also come a time when xmm-newton will come to the end of its life , and its important to have a replacement so that we do n't lose the capability to do x-ray astronomy . 
  i 'm probably biased though , since i work in x-ray astronomy . 
  the thought of a 500ks athena observation of ark564 makes me drool !, 
  that was an incredibly jumbled article - i feel rather lost as to what it was all about . 
  it failed as a science piece on a volcano , and it failed as an economic commentary , then ended with a bit of a damp-squib . 
  when i visited lesbos recently i was surprised by the number of village cooperatives . 
  is this less common in the rest of greece ? 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intersex#conditions i suggest that you educate yourself before holding a strong opinion on a subject . 
   alright , do we agree that there are only to sexes on this planet ? 
  no , we 're not going to agree on that , because it 's wrong . 
  there are a whole bunch of intersex conditions . 
  also gender is distinct from sex , albeit with a high degree of correlation . 
  i still do n't understand why you 're going on about gays and lesbians - since there is almost no connection . 
  what the fuck has being gay or lesbian got to do with anything ?
