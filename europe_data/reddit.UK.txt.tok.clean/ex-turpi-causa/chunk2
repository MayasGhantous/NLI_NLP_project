  sorry , could n't help myself . 
  zizek is excellent as always . 
  i think natural science is also a ` human-made ' construct . 
  a philosopher might argue that ` doing ' natural science is in a way infused with value judgements about the nature of the world ( empiricism etc ; i mean think about richard dawkins vs creatinists ) . 
  i think it 's easy to make the case the economics is a moral science to the extent that the implications of the research in terms of politics , policy etc are easy to view as morally-loaded . 
  it 's a good part of why it 's so difficult to talk about this stuff as you say . 
  this is what makes economics as a field so difficult at times . 
  philosophically speaking i have heard it described as a ` moral science . ', 
  so they were quite opposed , but they still wound up signing up to some stimulus at the time , more on their terms ? 
  is that what happened ? 
  i understand that . 
  but at the same time stimulus * was * used . 
  if it is n't accepted in any way shape or form as you implied , it would never even have been used . 
  again , i never mentioned germany ( i wrote ` pretty much all ' ) and i thanked you sincerely for the article -- it was interesting . 
  but the one who started this whole ` gotcha ' thing , ironically , was you , my friend . 
  no , not all of it . 
  it takes two to tango . 
  but yes , it is sadly in large part a political game about who will blink first . 
  this should be obvious given what you yourself have just written . 
  unfortunately , whenever one side makes a bold move that will just aggravate the other and the cycle continues . 
  this makes the tensions in the eu all that more interesting , particularly given germany 's economic success , but also more generally . 
  * it 's also interesting that germany was and did sign up to [ g20 stimulus plans . 
  ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2009/03/g20-stimulus-prasad ), 
  so , you take `` pretty much '' to mean literally every single country ? 
  it 's not really too surprising to see that attitude in germany given their history . 
  in either case , thanks for sharing , i found that interesting . 
  * there 's also [ this ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2010/08/german_recovery_3 ) by the economist claiming germany did spend , however . 
  just not in typical full on keynesianism fashion . 
  typically hardline keynesians respond , if and when stimulus does n't have entirely the precise empirical results advocated , by saying more should have been spent instead . 
  `` it 's not working only because we have n't done enough '' etc. 
  * it also does n't seem like you read past the title of that blog post :  however , in the longer term i wonder if ordoliberalism and keynesian ideas are really that incompatible . 
  dullien and guerot define the central tenet of ordoliberalism as `` governments should regulate markets in such a way that market outcome approximates the theoretical outcome in a perfectly competitive market '' . 
  the new keynesian view of stabilisation policy is to bring the economy as close as possible to the market equilibrium that would prevail if prices were flexible . 
  that does not sound so different . 
  i 've been following the rhetoric , and much of syriza 's actions amount to this kind of political game . 
  is it not glaringly obvious from tsipras 's inaugural act of laying flowers on the graves of nazi victims ? 
  where have you been ? 
  obviously if you inject huge bundles of money into an economy that 's going to boost it in some way . 
  it 's not really settled or easy to say what more precisely the stimulus did do , however . 
  treating any economic theory as ideology is just as senseless as the kind of dogma hardline ` neo-liberals ' advocate . 
  even keynes said this about his own work and how it had been politically co-opted .

  please , spare us the hyperbole . 
  keynesianism , or at least significant aspects of it , are accepted by pretty much * all * mainstream economists and governments . 
  it 's not surprising someone like varoufakis was given such short thrift -- not only do academics not really live in the real world ( yes , they do have critical and valuable theoretical insights on hypothetical situations ) but he comes across as someone with very little political understanding ( `` i disagree with your policies therefore you are terrorists '' probably is n't the best way to approach the matter ... but what do i know , i 've never been a finance minister ) . 
  reason and rationale never fully pervade political negotiation -- any well-grounded academic would be able to tell you this . 
  one who lives in a fantasy land of high-economic theory , however , will whine and complain , wondering why no one took him seriously . 
  have you read * catch 22 * ? 
  that 's what 's so funny about it . 
  oh , i would n't go that far . 
  i just do n't see the point of either side carrying on with that sort of rubbish . 
  but i think what you mean to say is * watch as greeks slowly leave the eu * ... 
  not really . 
  i think it 's pretty even to be honest , with plenty of people like you to ` balance ' it all out . 
   blaming anyone who disagrees as anti-greek or hateful of the greek people, 
   they probably thought they are some sort of master negotiators that could make treaties out of thin air . 
  well they did have varoufakis ... 
  i do n't follow what you 're saying . 
  you mean the probability rule that one learns in high-school maths ? 
  what 's clear is that you 've been set on trying to say ` greece is n't that bad , it 's all propaganda ' when really the truth is they 're not really a shining example either , blaming anyone who disagrees as anti-greek or hateful of the greek people . 
  that 's a bit much , fella , and you usually only see that in argument when the other person ca n't respond to a valid point . 
  oh brother indeed . 
  participants may tend to but that does n't mean they always do . 
  the same , again , can be said of the individual friend example . 
  for what it 's worth , my thesis supervisor was an expert in issues of empirical data in socio-economic research , specifically with relation to copyright . 
  what 's irritating and immature is that you seem to cast everyone critical of greece 's role in this mess as trying to paint a gross caricature . 
  this is not so , but simply a kneejerk reaction on your part . 
  \\* what 's more is that you seem to ignore that your data there shows the greeks as comfortably above average in terms of the size of their shadow economy as a % of gdp . 
  pure tax evasion as well * is nearly double * that of germany , for instance . 
  you 're criticising someone 's anecdote on the ground of a deficiency in the empirical constraints in gathering social data ( subjects lie , conditions change answers given etc ) , yet fully affirm an academic study that would be subject to those exact same constraints . 
  yeah , i actually agree with that on some level . 
  but that * is * how finance works , indeed selling any kind of good or service . 
  people just need to grow a pair and get on with it . 
  we all do fundamentally the same . 
   that could have helped greece 's economy to recover . 
  speculation , overruled . 
  straw man reversed . 
  ha , charming . 
  thanks for the interesting discussion . 
   dur financial sector proganduurrr . 
  the sector that knows nothing about finance . . what a worthless comment . 
  you seem aware of the limitations to empirical data in social research in the case of that one commenter , but not how your same arguments might apply to the holy grail of an academic paper . 
  how bizarre . 
  no , it 's just hating on greece . 
  numbers ca n't lie , amirite guise ? 
  what 's * your * point ? 
  do you even have one ? 
   that did not stop the imposers of austerity . 
  you 're missing the point if you only quote that one line of my comment . 
  look , i study law and economics . 
  i 'm not a slave to what the media tells me on these sorts of problems . 
  erm . 
  i guess the part about ` almost ' is difficult to understand , given that you 're only just now making that point . 
  you honestly think they 're going to give a party with the ideology and negotiating track-record of syriza a blank cheque ? 
  please . 
  but no one here is suggesting you blindly agree to anything either . 
  and again , this is n't ` austerity for the sake of austerity ' like your government would have you believe . 
  what do you even mean by ` austerity ' anyway ? 
  aside from it being inherently bad and some sort of ` punishment ? ', 
  to be clear i think greece should leave .
