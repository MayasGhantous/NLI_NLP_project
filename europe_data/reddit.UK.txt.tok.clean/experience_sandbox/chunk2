  brahman would be the hindu/vedic concept of god that most closely describes it . 
  that 's not what the term personal god means . 
  it 's the opposite of what i believe . 
  yes . 
  but i do n't believe in a specific conventional idea about what god is . 
  nor was i ever brought up in a religion . 
  god to me means a supreme consciousness beyond our existence and universe , which is the ultimate cause of this existence and universe . 
  therefore i do n't necessarily require any specific faith , and do n't follow any specific religious doctrine . 
  proof is everything around me and the experience that is taking place now . 
  this means i believe the physical universe is a product of consciousness , and not the other way round . 
  there does n't have to be a beginning or end to anything , what is wrong with a circle ? 
  i do n't think there is an all knowing , omnipresent being watching over us , or that is responsible for anything that happens . 
  however , each of us , and all of the universe is a small part of god . 
  also , i do think it is rather absurd to consider that this is supposed to be the highest level of reality , and see this as a somewhat anthropocentric belief , which is perhaps just a result of the human condition . 
  anthropocentric beliefs often seem ` unphilosophical ' somehow . 
  we obviously live in an illusion of sorts , and we ourselves ( our consciousness ) might also be part of that illusion . 
  regarding morality and ethics , generally it is best to try and be a reasonable person . 
  rules can get in the way of this , or help . 
  hopefully these are the sorts of ideas that some atheists and agnostics can get on-board with or understand . 
  i believe the scientific term is mongoloidism, 
  what do the greeks call it , western bulgaria ? 
  it 's all greek to me . 
  manchester here . 
  we are a brain drain on the country just like london is , due to our universities and being the capital of the north of england . 
  thousands upon thousands of people move here for work and study . 
  we also have a rich cultural history , and in many ways have led the country in various areas . 
  * ** we were the first industrialised city in the world ** ( that includes world 's first ever steam boats , world 's first ever steam mills , world 's first ever artificial waterway/canal , world 's first gas street lighting , world 's first ever bus routes , world 's first passenger railway was between us and our hated rivals liverpool , world 's first modern submarine , world 's first swing aqueduct , world 's first industrial estate , first british aeroplane , world 's first airline service , ** world 's first ( stored-program ) computer ** , etc. 
  * the sciences - home of the atomic theory ( we split the atom first ) , precision engineering , microphotography , thermodynamics , graphene , etc. 
  * culture - home of co-operative movement , home of the suffragette movement , home of modern/western vegetarianism , home of trade union movement , world 's first football league , world 's first international art exhibition , etc. 
  * present day - culturally we dominate in music and sports . 
  too many to mention . 
  many , many of my friends are originally from elsewhere in the country . 
  manchester sucks people in . 
  we apparently also have more languages than any other city in the world . 
  i 'm not sure what our main or most unique industry is really . 
  perhaps scientific research ? 
  we only really get patriotic about sport , and on occasion a royal celebration of some sort . 
  going back to the early days , we were n't particularly tolerant of religious extremists ( for example puritans , who held power for a while until we got rid of them ) and/or english dissenters . 
  many of them fled from these parts and crossed the atlantic . 
  i think this has probably had an affect on the historic hyper-religiosity of the american people . 
  the pilgrims ( of plymouth colony fame and thanksgiving ) were english dissenters . 
  thankfully we kept the less extreme types like quakers , who went on to found some of the finest businesses we 've ever known and helped bring about reforms in workers ' rights ( amongst other successes ) . 
  you know that means pubs charging the same for a pint , but you actually get less ? 
  not a fan of the alleged porcinophile , but cameron wanted us to stay in the eu . 
  he was the most prominent person in the media asking people to vote remain . 
  fair enough with farage , johnson ... do what you want with them . 
  thanks for the vote of confidence ? 
  hopefully we just vote back in at the next opportunity , if we are allowed back . 
  basically , this will happen when the next labour government is elected to power . 
   i doubt any american state really would prefer to secede from the us and go at it alone just to escape federal meddling . 
  fuck , what have our rural folk ( brexiters ) done to the uk ? 
  ` t ' , 'd ' and ` th ' are fairly interchangeable . 
  many americans , for example , fail to pronounce a proper ` t ' . 
  they often say `` war-der '' for water . 
  here in manchester , we pretty much just ignore the ` t ' in the middle of a word and carry on talking . 
  example : `` matt , where did you leave the water bottle '' becomes : `` ma - ' , where did you leave the wa ' - er bo ' - ul '', 
  filipino nurse at our local hospital killed a bunch of people . 
   first powered aeroplane flight if any type of flight then we have [ eilmer of malmesbury ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eilmer_of_malmesbury ) back in 11th century . 
  he broke both his legs . 
  albania , austria , belarus , bulgaria , croatia , czechia , france , germany , italy , lithuania , macedonia , moldova , montenegro , netherlands , poland , serbia , slovakia , slovenia , spain , switzerland , turkey , uk . 
  probably missed a couple . 
  it * really * reminded me of vic reeves ... https://youtu.be/2pre-duyesy, 
   kiribati fun fact : it is called kiribati because that 's how the locals pronounce the name gilbert . 
  the maltese and cypriots like us i think ... could be wrong . 
  interesting you mention that . 
  i 'm reading a book on history of languages at present , and yukaghir is mentioned as being possibly related to the uralic language group . 
  then there is the theory that proto-indo-european and proto-uralic are anciently related too . 
  western side of the urals is europe too !, 
  exactly , finnish is from the uralic language family , named after the mountains which are at the border of a fairly common definition of europe . 
  most likely to the western side . 
  therefore they are european languages by historical and modern definitions . 
  indo-european is from europe though . 
  north of the caucasus , between the black and caspian seas . 
  in the edgeley part of stockport we have : * berlin rd * petersburg road * vienna road * moscow road * stockholm road * finland road * bombay road * madras road * cashmir road * naples road probably a couple more . 
  the first cousin marriage is particularly problematic due to the fact that in certain communities it is n't an isolated marriage , rather it is the norm . 
  therefore a child can be born to parents who are first cousins , with two sets of first cousin grandparents , and so on . 
  there was a documentary a couple of years back where a female asian activist was visiting imams to ask them to advise people to stop the practice , but they were in favour of it . 
  there was also a woman who was a product of third generation first cousin marriage , she had a severely disabled son and intended to have more kids with her cousin/husband . 
  not my area , but we had bus-loads of mystery asian tourists in a quiet town called kidlington , in oxfordshire towards the end of last year . 
  now , let me be clear on this , nobody has heard of kidlington . 
  why these asian tourists ( some locals said they were chinese , some said they were japanese ... ) were wandering up and down a normal residential street in the suburbs of a town that is not famous was a mystery . 
  first we had news stories like this all over the media , about how nobody knows why they arrived : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-36706591 then it appears the journalists stopped being their lazy selves and actually asked why they were really there . 
  first it was reported they wanted to see the ` real ' england , and this town was apparently that : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-37820663 but then after a while it turns out the tourists had simply decided to not pay for the tour of blenheim palace , which is in the general area , but not near enough to walk to from that area of kidlington . 
  a chinese tour guide came clean and revealed they were dumping the tourists there , so they could n't get into the palace and pay for the guide at a normal price ... https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/world/europe/british-villagers-are-baffled-by-flocking-chinese-tourists.html?_r=1, 
  scotch egg ? 
  in manchester , we have public celebrations for chinese new year ( as does liverpool ) and parts of the city go wild at eid . 
  also you 'll find st. patrick 's day can be a big deal , and to a lesser extent burns night , and even anzac day celebrations . 
  never heard or seen anything for 4th july , but it would n't be surprising . 
  probably more of a london thing . 
  hallowe'en is massive throughout the country , and although some people consider it more of an american thing , it 's actually originally celtic . 
  we just tend to celebrate it in the american style . 
  diwali is also a big celebration in places , such as leicester . 
  notting hill carnival is a west-indian led event , but firmly british . 
  bath , york and even chester need some love . 
  very picturesque , great history too . 
  sorry , misunderstood . 
  there is debate over where exactly around the urals the language originated , and if on the east or western sides . 
  what is known is that uralic speaking people must have had regular contact with indo-europeans west of the urals for a prolonged period in pre-history . 
  the ( reconstructed ) languages partly attest to this . 
  i 've long believed the uralic urheimat was far to the west of the urals , possibly directly above the indo-european ( the modern view ) .
