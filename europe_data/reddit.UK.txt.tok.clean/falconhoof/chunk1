seems madrid should have offered a referendum if they wanted it decided on individual votes , should n't they ? 
   i do n't blame the uk population , but i do blame the imperialists and the political elite the uk population supported the imperialists and political elite .

  the irish , a great bunch of lads . 
  she grew up in a rich country with immense poverty , that 's governed by parties it did n't vote for . 
  that life experience is the reason she joined the snp . 
  a similar life experience from her constituents is the reason she won . 
  compare and contrast the comments here with the comments [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1se4rx/lenin_statue_toppled_in_ukraine_protest/ ), 
   you would n't expect that colonists in any other situation would have a say in the future of the territory they occupy , you just find it useful in this one case . 
  oh they would , see the north of ireland and las malvinas . 
  brits love colonialism, 
  i thought that was a union of four countries ? 
  it 's less `` they want to tear your country in half '' and more `` you do n't want their country to exist '', 
  how are the snp trying to tear england in half ?

  i 'm aware there has been an election in the interim , but i 'm not sure what the relevance is ? 
  the statement is pretty simple and i 'm still not sure what you 're getting at - other than being simple . 
  it was a conservative led coalition and a conservative government . 
  are you saying the conservative led government of 2014 lied , and we should just accept that we got stiffed and we 're up shit creek because the current conservative government is slightly different ? 
  despite the fact that the current conservative government were a part of the campaign that made the promises . 
   i think you mistake exactly what the act of union was . 
  that was a union of the crowns , not the creation of a uk-wide eu equivalent . 
  the result of combining the crowns was to create a single , unitary state . 
  that was the intended result and not some trick that scotland fell for . 
  not only is this irrelevant , it 's also inaccurate . 
  inaccurate because the union of the crowns and the act of union are two separate things which happened 100 years apart . 
  the crowns were united in 1603 , the state was created in 1707 . 
  irrelevant because most peoples views on the constitution and politics probably have probably changed somewhat in the last 300 years . 
  i do n't think you can really claim that scotland as a nation did anything in 1707 , it was 221 years before universal sufferage ffs . 
  a few barons agreed to it = / = the nation agreeing to it . 
   and you 're misunderstanding what they meant and what people understood by that statement . 
  nobody heard that and went away thinking that if scotland voted no , it would get veto rights over uk-wide decisions . 
  ofcourse , it 's so obvious what they meant . 
  * what the british said : `` the vote is not about whether scotland is a nation or a country , we 're already a nation and a country . 
  * what the british meant : `` scotland is not a country . 
  we 're a country in name only . '', 
  ------------------------- * what the british said : `` we 'll have a modern form of home rule for scotland '' * what the british meant : `` we 'll have a single indivisible unitary state '' --------------------- * what the british said : `` your eu membership will be protected if you vote no '' * what the british meant : `` your eu membership will be taken away from you by people in england and wales, 
  what are you getting at ? 
  can you expand on your point to more than two words ? 
  well at least that would be honest . 
  the uk government went to scotland in 2014 and said `` if you vote to stay in the uk scotland will still be a country and a nation , you 'll have home rule , and your eu membership will be protected '' . 
  now in 2016 they say `` you are n't really a country , we 're a single unitary state , and your eu status will be decided by people in england and wales . '', 
  it 's dishonest . 
  if they had said `` scotland is a country in name only '' in 2014 , and we voted no , then i would have no right to complain . 
  but they did n't . 
  they want to be able to have their cake and eat it . 
   nation just means a group of people with certain things common . 
  well that 's a ridiculous definition . 
  by that definition my family are a nation , since we 're a group of people who share the same language , culture and traditions . 
   either way , this is just hairsplitting to try and make a point . 
  it 's not hairsplitting , you just want to avoid the point because it 's inconvenient to you . 
   the uk is and has always been a unitary state . 
  the uk is and has always been a unitary state when it benefits the uk , the uk is and has always has been a `` family of nations '' when it benefits the uk . 
  you want to have your cake and eat it . 
   the idea that one part of that state - country or not - has the right to veto the decisions of the state as a whole has no precedent and no political grounding . 
  when the treaties of the eu are being modified , tiny malta has as much right to veto a change as huge germany does . 
  because malta and germany are both countries and that 's how unions between countries work . 
   nor has anyone been deceived into believing that the uk is anything but a unitary state . 
  except in 2014 of course . 
  if the no campaign had said in 2014 `` if you vote no scotland wo n't be a nation or a country , the uk is our country . 
  if you vote no scotland 's eu membership status will be determined by people in england and wales , and if you vote no the uk will be a single unitary state '' then that would have been fine , i would have no right to complain . 
  but that 's not what they said , is it ? 
  but the original comment said  why should a ** nation 's ** individual regions be allowed to veto ** nationwide ** referenda ? 
  if what you said is true then what they originally said ca n't be true . 
  either the uk is one single nation which held a national referendum and the result of the national referendum should be respected in all parts of the nation , or it 's a union of four nations which held a multi-national referendum and the results in all four individual nations should each be respected . 
  it ca n't simultaneously be both . 
  what they should have asked :  `` why should a nation in a union with other nations be allowed to veto a unionwide referenda ? '', 
  and the answer to that is obvious `` because nations have the right to self determination , even if they are in a union with other nations , and large nations should n't be able to impose their will on smaller nations '', 
  it 's not up to scotland to determine whether scotland stays in or leaves the eu either . 
  which i think is what most people are annoyed about . 
  i thought we were a `` family of nations '' ? 
  are we simultaneously a family of nations and one single nation , depending on which claim is more beneficial to unionists ? 
  devolution did n't exist when we entered the eu . 
   it 's really only a country because we call it a country . 
  well stop calling it a country then ? 
  lucky denis, 
   i realise that some remainers did not want a referendum because they feared that they would lose it , but a majority of the british people wanted one and a massive majority of mps wanted one . 
  people in my country had no interest in one , 98 % of mps were opposed to one , we then voted to remain in every single area of the country . 
  the british people did n't want one , the english and welsh people did . 
  i 've heard of silent letters . 
  but never invisible letters . 
  [ is gr\u00e3-bretanha the portuguese for great britain and northern ireland ? 
  ] ( http://i4.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article11713266.ece/alternates/s615/js96412770.jpg ), 
  but they did n't say team uk . 
  they are n't synonymous . 
  great britain is not in the un or a sovereign state . 
   dont worry scotland , eu will not let you down . 
  donald tusk wo n't even meet with scotland 's first minister . 
  they will let us down . 
   i wonder if you 're also ashamed to be scottish , seeings as scotland contributed just as much if not more to the dealings of the british empire . 
  of course i think imperialists from the north of the uk are just as repulsive as imperialists from the south . 
  but scotland has n't been a country since 1707 . 
  how can a country which does n't exist contribute to anything ? 
  do you think the hapsburg empire contributed just as much if not more to the bosnian genocide ? 
   st helena is n't a colony , it 's a dependent territory . 
  `` british dependent territory '' being a rebranding of `` crown colony ''  the territory is not being developed for any other reason than to help the people living there . 
  the people on the island , and the investment in them is nothing more than an excuse for british imperial ambitions in the region . 
   stolen from who ? 
  the acquisition of the island predates the founding of argentina . 
  i 'm not going to press this much because you know that this argument of yours is wrong and you are only fanatically clinging to it because you have a unjustified hatred of ` britain ' .
