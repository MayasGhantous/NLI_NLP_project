i 'm not talking about the gypsies , i 'm talking about romanians . 
  there fucking is when i was expecting beef . 
  do n't teach them better english , they will just use it to scam us better . 
  they have the same culture now , how is that irrelevant ? 
   sauerkraut is not german culture ... 
  wait , are you implying food is not culture ? 
  um , i have [ shit like this sent to my mail all the time ] ( http://www.scottishorigenes.com/ ) . 
   i am dr tyrone bowes and people employ my services to pinpoint where their scottish ancestors lived using only the results of a simple commercial ancestral dna test . 
  this test known as the y-dna37 test will potentially provide one with the names of many hundreds of individuals with whom one shares a common male ancestor , but what often perplexes people is how one can match many individuals with different surnames ? 
  the answer is quite simple . 
  roughly 1,200 years ago one 's direct medieval male ancestor , the first for example to call himself ` mcgregor ' was living in close proximity to others with whom he was related but who assumed other surnames like buchanan , drummond and murray . 
  given that 1,200 years have passed since surnames were adopted , there will be many descendants of these individuals some of whom today will undergo dna testing . 
  someone is buying that shit . 
  350 million people . 
  the second largest speakers of a ton of different languages live in the us . 
  http://www.craterlakeinstitute.com/online-library/historic-resource-study/4d.htm all the pacific nw tribes that were in the area when one of the world 's largest volcanic eruptions occurred have stories about it . 
   that 's pure fantasy . 
  oh so the native americans are n't human beings with culture ? 
  the klamath tribe was around [ 8000 years ago ] ( http://www.craterlakeinstitute.com/online-library/historic-resource-study/4d.htm ) when a volcano exploded nearby and have been continuously occupying the same lands since . 
  how many european cities are 8000 years old ? 
   nonsense . 
  if there is one thing we are seeing as a direct effect of the eu it is not homogenization but regionalization . 
  the eu strengthens the political and cultural impact regions have at the expense of the nation-state level . 
  lol , that is only because the anglicization of the language is not complete yet . 
  oh come on , europeans , like americans instead of claiming they are descended from modern nations just go back to prehistoric civilizations . 
  in scotland , growing up , boys would claim they were descended from norsemen while having gaelic or even english surnames . 
  it is the same thing . 
  to most americans , europe is a place that they will never go to , and it might as well be prehistory to them . 
  some say that , some do n't . 
  it is a quirk of language not a claim on citizenship . 
  ethnic can subsume both but does not have to . 
  one can be ethnically german-american and at the same time be culturally texan . 
  because they are fellow americans . 
   why should there be a large difference ? 
  because the local native american cultures for one are 100 's or even 1000 's of years older than most european cultures . 
  so cities that have integrated that into their cultural identities are arguably older than european cities . 
  in the pacific nw there are tribes that have gatherings that have been going on since before the pyramids were built with oral histories to back them up . 
  the uk still ca n't agree what went on at stonehenge . 
   even if that were true ... 
  because the eu is homogenizing as it federates . 
  same thing happend to the us when it went federal . 
  english is already the lingua de franca of the eu . 
  in the next 100 years you will start seeing english wholly replace other languages . 
  if it happened to the welsh , the scots , the cornish , etc. 
  it will happen to you . 
  maybe in 2200 there will be a german language revival . 
   they just look japanese . 
  who the fuck cares about that ? 
  americans do . 
  americans unlike cosmopolitan westerner europeans have two identities . 
  one ethnic , and one cultural . 
  slavic people do the same thing . 
  is it because ethnicity is taboo in germany ? 
  i myself immigrated to the usa almost 40 years ago but i still consider myself at least part scot for growing up in glasgow and visiting every summer , and because of keeping those connections alive i 've imparted a bit of that culture on two generations of my family in the us . 
  you are acting as if you ca n't produce german culture outside of germany . 
  i disagree . 
  the second largest consumer of sauerkraut in the world is the usa . 
  food is culture and americans have assimilated german culture into what it means to be an american for 100 's of years . 
  why ca n't you be proud that generations upon generations of americans consider themselves ethnically german in part even after all this time ? 
  it is the ethnic part , is it not ? 
  this is the [ german american school ] ( http://www.gspdx.org/ ) that one of my friend 's grandchildren goes to . 
  the kid is not even remotely german , in the least . 
  he is ethnically filipino . 
  yet , that school would not exist if some americans did not identify ethnically/culturally as germans and continue to support it financially . 
  how many scots can speak scottish gaelic ? 
   you 're not german , you 're american . 
  no one is asking where you 're ancestors 5 generations back are from . 
  that is simply how americans talk about their ancestry . 
  americans also identify where they grew up as a separate identity . 
  is that so complicated our european brains ca n't comprehend why they would do that ? 
   `` down here in texas we grill meat in a slightly different way and our opinions on social issues are a bit different '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_united_states it is not monolingual , how could it be monocultural ? 
  ever been to a native american reservation ? 
  as someone who has been to all four , albeit munich almost 20 years ago , it is true enough . 
  miami 's [ primary language ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24871558/ns/us_news-life/t/miami-spanish-becoming-primary-language/ ) and culture is from cuban , mexican , and caribbean immigrants . 
  compared to [ minnesota which was settled by scandinavians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_american ) ? 
  i mean come on , you 've never been to either american city have you ? 
  i 'm sick of this argument , you want to compare copenhagen with seville which are wholly dissimilar cities and then cherry pick american ones to make them seem more similar . 
  what about the difference between [ portland , maine ] ( http://www.visitportland.com/ ) and [ sante fe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santa_fe,_new_mexico ) . 
  both have 400 + year old buildings in wholly different styles , mainstream cultures that incorporate local native american culture , etc. 
  if you pick any large eu metro at the moment you are seeing the same sort of downtown gentrification of row houses , with satellite enclaves of apartments and tech/industrial/government campuses w / light rail or subs between them . 
  they are n't saying they are a citizen of those countries or even culturally from there . 
  they are saying that is where there ancestry is from . 
  how is this confusing ? 
  do scots need to speak scottish gaelic or scottish english ? 
  this is the problem with german , it is too exact of a language for such a misunderstanding to occur . 
  there are literally [ 100 's of dialects of english now ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_dialects_of_the_english_language ) . 
  in american english : * i am irish . 
  * implies ancestry , not citizenship , or even cultural ties . 
  people in europe do the same shit with extinct cultures they ostensibly descended from . 
  think of all those weirdo * druids * in wales and scotland . 
  i guess it is either that or join nato . 
  i 'm sure the swedes would just welcome the russians anyway instead of fighting . 
  why do n't you guys learn the russian , for yes , sir !, 
  i 've seen people talk about putin 's regime disparagingly but never the russian people themselves . 
  that is all it takes and boom you are a thetan being blown up by nuclear weapons in the heart of a volcano . 
  well , then you are talking about putin being deposed by regime change . 
  which i would hope our intelligence agencies have prepared for . 
  let us not shed anymore eu blood on this matter . 
  let the internet-age revolution come home to roost in russia , so that the peculiar sort of russian-style sleight of hand corruption may be writ large in the public eyes . 
  russia has been promising their people various rights for centuries without fully giving them to them .
