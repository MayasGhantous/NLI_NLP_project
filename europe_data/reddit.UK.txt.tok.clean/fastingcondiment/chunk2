  why do you think countries will suddenly be more open to increased military spending if it had an eu label and not a national one ? 
  nato has specific plans for all sorts of attacks . 
  it has countries frequently cooperating and has personnel where an attack is most likely . 
  eu on the otherhand is a sort of `` errr , everyone must do what they can okay ? '', 
   has a eu member state been attacked where the rest of the eu did n't react ? 
  perejil island crisis france and portugal did not support spains claim to the island . 
  if that was a serious incident the eu would have lost nearly 1/5 of its military spending and a significant chunk of its expertise , experience and equipment . 
  this is insane . 
  how does moules-frites contain 900 calories ? 
  i guess it depends on what people are buying instead of vodka . 
  mate its an uninhabited rock that you managed to ` reconquer ' when the poor bastards ` occupying ' it the surrendered at the first sign of any spanish troops . 
  there were zero injuries , never mind deaths . 
  no one even stubbed their toe . 
  did you expect the eu to mobilise or something ? 
   russians no longer think nuclear war would be end of everything no one does any more , if they ever did . 
  he isnt exactly complaining about the lack of drinks in a vending machine . 
  last week your country claimed they are committing war crimes , this week you are hosting them in your ports . 
  you 're not poland ... 
  the fact you consider a single post a `` shitfest '' is hilarious . 
  we 're like eskimos , 100 words for grey and raining . 
  / r/unitedkingdom is fine if you are a euphile who love corbyn and hates the uk . 
  / r/unitedkingdom somehow makes / r/europe look rational when talking about brexit . 
  says a lot about her party . 
  like the scandinavians ... 
  they arent trying to order a baguette and two beers . 
   she never wanted economic migrants comming here , she only wanted to manage the incoming hords of real refugees from war zones . 
  every syrian who came along the land route is an economic migrant . 
  poland drunk on everyone else 's turn but is now refusing to buy his round . 
   spain and argentina made jumps because of austerity . 
  what is this shite ? 
  why is this a bad thing ?

  i dont think we will become a republic any time soon but i think when the queen dies people will be much more open to talking about getting rid of the monarchy . 
  currently its like talking about putting your nan in a carehome so you can sell her house . 
  neither of those are breakfasts . 
  and those traditions began with change . 
  pizza didnt disappear when those sailors started eating ones without cheese . 
  what 's funny is if this was a brit throwing stuff at a polish persons house or a polish speciality shop , people here would be clamouring about hate crime and how brits are all racist as fuck . 
  but because its a pole and muslims it 's just a laugh . 
  thats a very short sighted way to look at it . 
  as a dog owner i completely agree . 
  owning a dog is a pain in the arse and other dog owners are a large reason why . 
  i guess its harder than films make it out to be , there was a video from an old british solider ( i think he fought in ww2 ) saying that the only sure way to kill someone in that movie slitting their throat kind of way was to stab in sideways and then force the blade outwards through their wind pipe . 
  that second one makes me want to go fight some one . 
  lower the number the better the food . 
  fucking anglo media . 
  because its an amusing story about a character we already know . 
  haha pride is so icky amirite . 
  victim blaming . 
  old english sheep dogs are a surprisingly small dog when you trim their fur a bit . 
  another advantage is that oes ' can be dumb as a box of rocks if they want to be . 
  yeah but its all taxed . 
  eu countries could barely agree to put * sanctions * on russia . 
  russia would sunning themselves on the atlantic coast before every eu country agreed to a declaration of war . 
   and every operation should be approved by all participating nations . 
   lol why not get rid of ranks and officers while you are at it . 
  imperator . 
  pro european coups arent expected in the baltics any time soon . 
  how happy would you be if you was sent to the falklands to defend english colonial territory ? 
  naturally it 's not going to happen ~ ~ tomorrow :p ~ ~, 
  because it gets views from all over europe . 
  like how you 'd think we were on the verge of a race war right after brexit but then the reporting disappeared when it came out that the vast majority of the attacks were verbal ones and the increase wasnt all that big considering the number of poles to the number of incidences . 
  pretty sure it was the all the colonising that gave the english a bad name . 
  sure proved me wrong there . 
  the eu has around 3500 athletes at the olympics , compared to america which has around 500 . 
  its more the colour . 
  american tv people all have pearly whites whereas in the uk , less than pearly white makes it onto tv . 
  do you always argue like a 12 year old ?
