  if we waited for attitudes to change we 'd be failing those who are unequally treated . 
  i suppose it 's unfortunate for those who want cyprus to change itself , i 'd much rather that happens than the eu failing to live up to it 's own standards of equality and fairness though , that 'd be failing to look after its own people and stick to its principles . 
  in the end it could be argued that the attitudes of the west towards these things has passed on to cyprus and that is what is causing the change , in which case you 're already being `` forced '' in to equality . 
  in your many words i could n't find many ideas , you think the only discussion on rights should be internally in cyprus without anyone from the eu even talking about it ? 
  i 'm not sure how you can think that could happen in the modern world . 
  your first reaction to these comments did n't seem to be questioning your own country anyway , your first comment was literally `` fuck that guy '' and you also seem to have some view of `` the west '' as this domineering figure that will crush you with its mean gaze and force upon you equality . 
  either that or you feel very much under attack when it is pointed out that cyprus is n't in fact the leader of the world in this aspect , the uk is also pretty shit at that kind of thing at the moment , i do n't feel oppressed by the countries that suggest the uk should improve in those areas though . 
  your use of `` the west '' as if it is being some cohesive liberal oppressor is also very amusing . 
  more jeering i say . 
  i 'm not quite sure what you mean , we ca n't criticise certain countries for being homophobic just because it might hurt their feelings ? 
  if people want to leave your country you need to ask some hard questions about why that is , if people feel more european than a part of cyprus , then again , you need to ask some questions about what kind of society permits the level of hatred that can make someone want to abandon their own birthplace and nationality . 
  like it or not , some countries are more progressive about equality and homosexuality than others , i 'd rather look towards their example and exceed it rather than somehow play the victim in all of this and pretend there is nothing wrong . 
  your whole idea has n't really come across to me very clearly though , so i could in fact be ranting on for no reason at all . 
  dear slovenian person , none of us even look at the eu political talks to be honest , they are n't very fun . 
  yours faithfully , bunnysnuggler21 < 3, 
  `` us air strikes target members of al qaida '' very surprising indeed . 
  i know danish students are n't lagging behind , you have a good education system . 
  i was just questioning if time could be better spent on courses that can make children very useful to the modern world and make their search for work much easier as well , that 's not to say that learning 5 languages could n't make you much better off in life , i just think it 's more useful to have 1 commonly spoken language that we all learn and spend the newly freed up teaching time to focus on other subjects . 
  obviously that is in a perfect world where there is no politics behind language , but it 's obviously easy for me to suggest a common language as the most likely candidate would be my native language :p, 
  `` jersey is part of the ancient duchy of normandy , and is ruled by the duke of normandy -- a title held by the reigning monarch of the united kingdom , though unrelated to those duties as king or queen of the uk . '', 
  sooooo basically the queen ? 
  i 'd consider that an overall better education system , rather than learning a language can magically make someone better at maths . 
  it may not have hurt you in comparison to us , but i do n't think anyone doubts that more time spent on maths and science will make children better at those things , in a competent education system that is . 
  yes , you are in the minority and people will continue to post things related to specific countries of europe , even if they do n't directly concern the whole of europe . 
  `` get used to it '' sounds too strong for this situation but i 'd consider it good advice . 
  well this is where the upvotes come in to play , if people truly did n't think this was interesting then it 'd be downvoted , has that happened ? 
  you are now wrong . 
  the thread about estonia had pretty much nothing to do with russia anyway , it was a disagreement over a family related law , russians are n't the only conservatives in eastern europe . 
  lets just be happy we 're all together and have a cuddle and make up < 3, 
  a bridge in germany has more international importance than a story related to the largest employer in europe ? 
  a german graffiti artist is of more importance in europe than a story related to the largest publicly funded health service in europe ? 
  politics in estonia are relevant to europe but politics in the uk are n't ? 
  give me a break . 
  we ca n't be sure of it , but the discussions about the currency and the share of the uk debt did n't look like they 'd suddenly turn in to friendly meetings in the event of a yes vote . 
  i 'm not actually sure where those rioters came from the day after the referendum though , the no campaign did n't really capture people 's hearts as much as play on the doubts in their minds . 
  the nationalists also had their fair share of public misconduct . 
  racism in romania , spanish police vs protestors , beardless jesus engraving found in spain , protests over a law in estonia , a bridge in germany , a german graffiti artist who died , ukrainian politician dragged around in a bin , latvia 's election . 
  these are all on the front page of this subreddit , some of them have slight connections to europe as a whole , but others have almost no connection at all to europe as a whole other than that they are things occurring in a european country . 
  the uk is a european country , hence why this post is here . 
  i would argue that obviously there are benefits but to learn 5 is going too far with the whole idea , more lessons about computer science and mathematics would be far more useful than learning any more than 3 languages maximum ( including the native language ) . 
  i think if you look at the front page of this sub then you 'll realise that most threads are about things specific to one european country , and again i shall repeat , the uk is part of europe . 
  if that does n't make it relevant to europe then i 'm really not sure what is relevant to europe . 
  `` there were no ovens , no gas chambers , it 's a lie , '' `` auschwitz , what auschwitz ? 
  i did n't go there . 
  what happened there ? 
  have you been there , '' he asked a reporter in the interview , adding that he had `` read lots of books casting doubt on the number of six million jews '' - nikolaos michaloliakos ( leader of golden dawn ) . 
  nigel farage just believes that romania is not currently compatible with the rest of the eu , while i disagree with that , it 's so very different from being a neo-nazi . 
  ukip is about euroscepticism , golden dawn is about neo-nazism . 
  if you ca n't recognise the difference between those then i 'm not sure how you tie up your shoelaces . 
  with your recent [ golden dawn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_dawn_ ( political_party \\ ) ) of liberal , anti-racist ideas we should all be looking to greece for guidance . 
  maybe because you stopped being nazis so everyone decided that you guys being rich benefited us all instead of threatening us all . 
  the uk is part of europe in case you did n't know .

  if you read the link i provided you might see what i mean , this went on for a long time and its effects linger on . 
  if i 'm honest that seems like too many , it takes up a lot of time that might be better spent on other subjects . 
  it 's very clear which side of the argument you are on . 
  i 'd like to add that the working class are also easiest to manipulate using nationalism . 
  the simple fact is that criticising the current government is much easier than improving it , breaking apart is much easier than creating a union that works for all of us . 
  i 'd hope that the people of scotland realise that if we do make this union work for all of us then it will give greater benefits than a bitter divorce ever could . 
  many people on here like the idea of the eu doing just that and the history of the eu is only one of ever closer ties , unless you think that is going to change . 
  okay . 
  i would n't complain if i were you , the queen will come and sort you out with her corgi army . 
  if you do n't think that policies of the past have made any difference to the present then i do n't think there is much point talking to you . 
  if you had read the link i gave you you might have stumbled upon this though `` the first wave of purges between 1929 and 1934 targeted the revolutionary generation of the party that in ukraine included many supporters of ukrainization . 
  soviet authorities specifically targeted the commissar of education in ukraine , mykola skrypnyk , for promoting ukrainian language reforms that were seen as dangerous and counterrevolutionary ; skrypnyk committed suicide in 1933 . '', 
  or maybe even this `` in the 1960s , the ukrainian language began to be used more widely and frequently in spite of these policies . 
  in response , soviet authorities increased their focus on early education in russian . 
  after 1980 , russian language classes were instituted from the first grade onward . 
  [ 8 ] '' so what you are saying is that a sustained effort to destroy the ukrainian language and promote the russian language going on for hundreds of years wo n't make any sort of difference to the current usage of russian in ukraine ? 
  `` the russian government promoted the spread of the russian language among the native ukrainian population by actively suppressing the ukrainian language . 
  alarmed by the threat of ukrainian separatism implied by a growing number of school textbooks teaching the ukrainian language , the russian minister of internal affairs pyotr valuev in 1863 issued a secret decree that banned the publication of religious texts and educational texts written in the ukrainian language . 
  [ 7 ] '' i think anything ukraine may be doing to lessen the use of russian is minimal compared to the things that were done to abolish the ukrainian language . 
  [ this is a good read . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russification_of_ukraine ), 
  i can feel the money . 
  three languages seems insane to me , i 'm barely good at one . 
  i doubt germany has done this without ukrainian consent , russia on the other hand ... 
  seems as your original comment was posted about 10 hours ago i think many of us are already laughing . 
  the usa ca n't do it , as a collective of all its people and companies . 
  this really was just a joke as you said that if people from the us are told they ca n't do something then they will do it , you definitely ca n't stop replying to me . 
  ( that means stop replying to me in case you did n't work it out ), 
  the # is as much a european currency as the euro is . 
  this is n't about the eu after all , especially considering that the website that was linked to has a blog post about swiss watches . 
  complaining about . com vs . eu is pretty stupid as well , i have n't really seen many websites at all that use '' . eu '' . 
  i did n't think we were famed for our knives , i am quite handy with a butter knife though , someone has to butter my crumpets ( ooh er ) after all . 
  danish propaganda is just giving people lots of tasty pastries until they agree with you right ? 
  it sounds like you should go and live with these isis people then , they have an independent country and obviously we 're only bombing them because the saudis told us to so how bad can they be ? 
  how anyone thought that a group of politicians would treat them any better than another group of politicians is beyond me . 
  was n't scottish independence in the event of a yes vote going to take 2 years anyway ? 
  considering the things the russians tried to do to the ukrainian language , this is a very minor deal . 
  it 's also simply more practical , 260 million people speak russian to some degree , 1259-1859 million people speak english ( estimates vary depending on how literacy is defined and measured ) . 
  so basically you ca n't do it . 
  what does nato represent in your opinion ? 
  and the eu is closer ties between all of the nations inside the eu , considering that even if scotland some day leaves the uk it will rejoin the eu , the rest of the uk and scotland would still have close ties as part of the eu . 
  what is the major difference between both of those unions anyway ? 
  if the eu will continue towards closer and closer ties between the nations that are part of it , then will it be any different than being in the uk anyway ? 
  ah okay , and yes i think that money could be better spent too , education to make people more useful for the kind of jobs that sustain themselves in our current and future economy would be a good place to put some of that money . 
  where is that number from ? 
  are you agreeing with me ? 
  i 'm not quite sure what is going on if i 'm honest .
