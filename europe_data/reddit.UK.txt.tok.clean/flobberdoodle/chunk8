  well we ask them where they are trying to get to in their boats and they keep telling us they want to get to italy , so we take them . 
  i blame the good food and sunshine . 
  `` and to flobberdoodle ; let 's not forget the uk semi-blocked porn or cameron saying he wants the removal of any encrypted service , i would say it 's pretty even :p '' cameron 's a cunt and those laws are dumb , but they are national laws and only apply to us in the uk , the right to be forgotten applies all across the eu . 
  people in the uk have a big issue with the eu interfering in stuff like this , we would rather see the eu focusing on economic growth and global trade . 
  the difference is that our mps only change stuff in our country . 
  surely you can see how this kind of thing can really mess with the reputation of the eu in the uk , even if this exact thing is n't passed there have been some silly blunders before , which is why i mentioned the right to be forgotten . 
  your example with someone becoming a meme is n't a good one at all , how the hell is google going to remove a meme from the internet ? 
  simply trying to do so would make the whole thing worse , see the streisand effect . 
  censoring the internet simply does n't work , any attempt to do it just seems incredibly stupid , like when our government said it would put in opt-out filters that ban `` porn '' sites and basically just put random shit they do n't like on the list . 
  it does n't work , the difference there was that the legislation only applied to the uk , the right to be forgotten applies to every country in the eu . 
  i 'll have one bulket please . 
  yep , it 's shit . 
  the uk has to be blamed for your politicians choice to potentially follow in our footsteps on certain issues ? 
  stretching the blame pretty thin here . 
  and yes , i meant you dislike the uk so you are involving us in the discussion , my original comment was about the silly proposal and how it changes perception of the eu in the uk . 
  i actually want the eu to be seen as quite positive in the uk , you just seemed to jump on the opportunity to say `` how is cameron any better ? '', 
  i never even said cameron was any better , many people here dislike him completely , obviously not enough to stop him from getting re-elected though . 
  the right to be forgotten is a thing now , right ? 
  both seem equally as stupid anyway . 
  at no point did i say that either gchq or david cameron have a good reputation in the uk . 
  you 're just making this about us because you dislike us , also our laws do n't apply to you in your country , eu laws apply to almost everyone in the eu . 
  good , stay there . 
  i also disagree with the whole `` right to be forgotten '' nonsense though as well , it pisses me off . 
  dumb decisions in any parliament are always going to happen , but the eu having control over all of this when many just want them to focus on increasing trade and growth is what makes people want to leave it . 
  personally i favour staying in though . 
  all languages are human and them influencing each other is natural , i only disagree with changes if they are implemented because of some political hostility . 
  some of the changes to american english were just that , but american slang coming in to regular use is really not a problem at all and certainly is n't pollution . 
  at no point did i say that either gchq or david cameron have a good reputation in the uk . 
  it 's true that david cameron did just get elected again , but it 's also true that the only party really fighting for less censorship in general got fucked over at the election because they promised something at the last election that they simply could n't deliver . 
  if internet censorship and gchq were the only concerns that our voters had , then i doubt that cameron would have been re-elected with the views that he currently has on those things . 
  i 'm just rambling now . 
  true , the same thing could be said about tabloids from any european country though . 
  it 's just that instead of them blackening the name of the eu , they are usually giving greece or the uk a bad name . 
  some of their reasons are justified , most of it is just trumpeted up rubbish . 
  this post is a pretty clear case of the eu just being plain dumb though , it does n't really need anything attaching to it to make it any more stupid . 
  true , that kind of law would really piss off some of the more conservative countries though . 
  i 'm not sure how it would go down in ni . 
  same sex marriage has already been made legal here , it will make no difference to us if the eu makes it legal across the whole of the eu . 
  does n't this get a bit messy because some eu nations do n't want to be part of nato ? 
  also i think that all nations in the eu military should pay their 2 % of gdp . 
  that means the uk as well though , i do n't agree to the recent cuts . 
  there is a big question about international involvement as well though , while the eu military would be the undisputed military power of the european continent , would it also commit to foreign intervention ? 
  or would there be so much disagreement between nations that the whole idea crumbles as soon as a real test emerges ? 
  things like this give the eu a really shit reputation in the uk . 
  complete nonsense . 
  still means it 's beneficial for greece , but i understand what you mean . 
  i just think endlessly rephrasing something to make it sound a bit better is silly . 
  a language being influenced by another is pollution of that language ? 
  if you expand upon that then your french academy is only protecting a polluted mess itself , no language is `` pure '' . 
  also is n't it bad to label english language , and by extension culture , as pollution ? 
  maybe even pejorative ? 
  `` it is not ok to make pejorative statements about large cultural , national or ethnic groups especially when these groups are not entered into by choice ( e.g. 
  race , gender , sexuality ) . '', 
  i think you are being a bit too free with your speech there citizen . 
  pick up that can . 
  [ you could have just been using this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_as_she_is_spoke ), 
  i 'm not sure , ask the nsa . 
  so pro-eu because the eu is beneficial in certain ways ? ... 
  `` the right thing '' might as well just be `` the right thing for greece in the long term '' . 
  i do n't disagree that the current proposals for managing the debt simply do n't work , i was just saying that those 2 sentences essentially mean the same thing . 
  the eu methods at the moment are basically telling them that the bill is due . 
  if you have a very large problem with the people on here then it 's quite easily solved . 
  us government spied on my grandma ama, 
  you expected them to react differently ? 
  are we using the same site here ? 
  reddit jumps on the slightest bit of drama with glee , with all the drama from this it was like an all-you-can-eat buffet for many redditors . 
  i was n't being serious , do n't worry about it . 
  free speech is limited everywhere , and yet it still exists as a concept . 
  interesting eh ? 
  but seriously , you are n't understanding what i mean at all . 
  a person has an issue with something , this thing happens to be how limited free speech is becoming on reddit , they knew it was limited before obviously but they think it is now becoming an issue that they want to complain about . 
  it 's an ** issue ** to that particular person and it 's about their increasing lack of ** free speech ** on reddit . 
  i ca n't be bothered to explain this any more , of course they have no legal right to sue reddit about it , but reddit are trampling over what little free speech these people thought they had on here , that 's the issue they are complaining about and they do realise they have no power to change it . 
  never go full / u/dclauzel, 
  freedom of speech is a concept , is this hard to understand ? 
  it exists everywhere . 
  if someone disagrees with censorship of discussions , then it is a freedom of speech issue to that person . 
  it 's an issue to them . 
  an issue is an important topic or problem for debate or discussion . 
  if you keep arguing this then i 'm going to have to assume that i 'm actually talking to a moose that has learned how to use the internet . 
  you basically said the same thing . 
  the first sentence might as well be a copy and i guess phrasing is as `` anti-eu when bills are due '' makes it sound a bit worse than '' anti-eu in the methods of dealing with matters at hand . '', 
  but it 's hardly worlds apart . 
  you do n't get my point , i 'm saying that obviously reddit has control of what happens on their website , you 're saying it like it 's something nobody knows . 
  freedom of speech is a concept though , reddit is currently limiting freedom of speech too much for many people . 
  they are unhappy about it , which makes it is a freedom of speech issue to them . 
  are you just imagining that these redditors are trying to make this a legal case of denying someone freedom of expression ? 
  why is it ? 
  do you think people will think differently just because you shut it down ? 
  all i saw when they shut it down was the stuff posted on fph ending up on the frontpage , i did n't even know the sub existed until the drama started . 
  free speech is just free speech though , and harassment is really not easy to define ... if we are talking about the legality of things then whose laws are we going on ? 
  also if we are talking about law then half of the stuff on here could be illegal in some way . 
  there are certainly some really fucked up subreddits that post much worse shit . 
  reddit is well within its rights to give everyone a number and then start picking the numbers randomly and banning people based on that . 
  so there are some immigrants that will be fluent in hungarian ? 
  it 's pretty clear that these billboards were aimed at hungarians like the other comments say , i just thought it was a bit funny that anyone even thinks putting signs up in hungarian would give some sort of message towards people fresh from syria . 
  he is very involved in german politics which makes him too involved in the politics surrounding the current issues to be impartial , it 's also very likely that he cares less about greece and more about his political career . 
  every politician is like this . 
  i never said you could trust what she says either .
