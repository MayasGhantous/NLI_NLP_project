  so that 's the ere i was looking at for my arguments . 
  [ here 's 1900-1944 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_1900%e2%80%9344 ) if you want to look at the 1800 's then [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_1800%e2%80%9399 ) , the uk is involved in a lot ( but not most by any means ) but that does n't mean the uk started them , it means that they got involved to help out the side that suited their interests . 
  just like the us as the superpower of today gets involved in other people 's conflicts . 
  [ here 's a few hundred years more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_1500%e2%80%931799 ) . 
  anyone who thinks all the bad that happens was the fault of the uk is too anglo obsessed and needs to get a history book . 
  the french , spanish , dutch , russians , and so on were not peace loving . 
  australia could get rid of the monarchy any time it wanted you mong , what year do you think this is ? 
   typical english , want out of europe but want to control scotland . 
  it 's funny i did n't hear anyone speaking out for the oppression of the english during the 13 years before david cameron got in office that we were led by two men born in scotland , with a labour government that scotland voted for at each general election . 
  misleading . 
  the chart shows that the largest number is in ireland , the majority of those people claiming will undoubtedly be northern irish , people who half of which do n't think at all of the roi as a foreign country , have family there , and in fact can even claim roi passports . 
  western/central europe ( except for germany ) is pretty even , and for eastern europe there are about 14 individuals claiming compared to over 25,000 of them claiming in the uk . 
  the usa disappearing would change * everything * , a vast chunk of mainstream international media would vanish , most of the biggest websites on the internet ( including this one ) would cease to function , 8 out of the top 10 most valuable brands in the world would no longer exist . 
  goodbye facebook , goodbye coca cola , goodbye hollywood . 
  that does n't even touch on foreign policy , the us has been sticking its finger in every pie around the world ( either covertly or up front ) since near enough the end of ww2 , it is the worlds only superpower with huge force projection . 
  meanwhile china has had a way more isolationist foreign policy . 
  china manufactures [ slightly more ] ( https://www.mapi.net/china-largest-manufacturer-world ) than the us , but it 's generally much lower quality goods , and the production of which could be moved elsewhere given enough time . 
  then there 's [ innovation ] ( http://images.businessweek.com/bloomberg/pdfs/most_innovative_countries_2014_011714.pdf ) , the us is a world leader in technology , science research , etc , meanwhile china has a grand total of 8 nobel prize winners . 
  i almost forgot medical research , the us ' messed up profit obsessed health care system results in them being far and away the most important country for medical innovation . 
  christ , i could go on and on , but realized i 've got carried away already . 
  people have nothing else to insult him by as he 's anonymous so they go off nationality , i would n't take it personally . 
  most americans on here are fine really . 
  germany declared war on the us . 
  anyway the whole point i think is that it 's unfair to use this `` we get wrapped up in your wars '' line , the japanese attack on the us just goes to show that nobody is safe from nutjobs , it 's not just a europe problem . 
   no the british just started most of the armed conflicts [ yeah , check out all these british wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_1945%e2%80%9389 ) . 
  the world would be so peaceful without us . 
   was it worth it ? 
  all the deaths and 50 year of communism occupation in east europe ? 
  no i think not yes ? 
  blatantly yes ? 
  eastern europe was buggered either way , but we and a lot of the rest of europe have lived in freedom since the end of the war rather than under a fascist dictatorship . 
  it gives me an inkling as to what kind of nutter you are that you would even pose that question . 
  they are from germany , and got arrested for this . 
   [ eleven self-styled `` sharia police '' who patrolled the streets of a german town to dissuade people from drinking are facing charges of unlawful assembly and misuse of uniforms ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article4200400.ece ), 
  something like that would probably just be covered up by both sides and discussed down behind closed doors . 
   the americans , british and russians together beat the nazis in mainland europe . 
  canadians did their bit too , as the dutch will keenly tell you . 
  ukip rarely mention asylum seekers , they talk about eu migration . . makes sense considering their objective is to leave the eu . 
  i see . 
  from reading that thread it sounds like they attempted to block an illegal image and it mistakenly resulted in the website being blocked for about a day . 
  when you say `` we have the iwf watchlist that bans big sites like imgur '' it sounds like a much bigger deal . 
  imgur is n't banned in the uk , i do n't know what he 's talking about . 
  the only blocked websites i know of are torrent sites . 
  you would be correct . 
  nobody said officers from england , scotland , wales and northern ireland were * all * involved . . he simply said that british ones were . 
  the point was that oil prices are the only thing determining whether scotland contributes more than it spends or not . 
  nothing else is important to this discussion , it all comes down to whether the oil that happens to be in the water next to scotland 's landmass is selling well or not . 
  without the oil revenue included scotland pays in a lot less than is spent there per capita , that 's why the oil figures are relevant . 
  when the oil prices are high then scotland generates a bit more than it spends , but for the rest of the time it does not at all . 
  as another user pointed out the survey did n't include other kids from uk than england . 
  i 'd be interested to hear what policies you think are in place in scotland and especially in wales ( which has significantly less devolved power ) that would make kids there happier than those in england , until shown otherwise i would assume that there would n't be much difference . 
  i 'm not condoning it , i 'm just saying that 's the way it is . 
  if a guy was down the pub with his friends and revealed seriously that he wanted to have sex with justin bieber they would look at him differently . 
   it now being social acceptable to have a man/girl crush a woman having a girl crush yes , but i could never imagine a mate of mine saying he had a `` man crush '' and getting away with it without ridicule . 
  it has the scotland , ireland ( old irish flag ) , and england flags in there . 
  there 's no dragon slapped on the top or big green patches to represent wales , but honestly that would look crap anyway . 
  they did n't ignore it . 
   here are some of the european regions that may best admire the scottish bid for independence . 
  the headline is `` places that could be next '' as in after the referendum in scotland . 
  i agree with you that there is no serious independence talk about wales or cornwall . 
  ireland and australia . 
  maybe new zealand , but honestly i do n't know enough about them to know that for sure . 
  ** major european countries in 2050 ( in millions ) ** france : 71.1 germany : 74.5 italy : 56.5 poland : 33.1 spain : 44.8 uk : 75.3, 
  what did we do in syria ? 
  anyway , few of the migrants are actually from libya , they just pass though that country on their way from sub saharan africa or other places . 
  what a crap article . 
  there may be 5,000 at any one time , but that 's only because hundreds are successfully getting through , and are being replaced by new ones . 
   and they 're probably nicer than us based on what ? 
  we know nothing about them . 
  i 'm sure most of them are fine , but fuck sake let 's not forget that the countries they are coming from have stone age views on women 's rights , lgbt issues etc , they are not children they are grown men who were raised in those societies . 
   these few cold , wet , paedophile-producing square miles of rock if you hate the country so much feel free to trade places with one of the migrants . 
  anyway , yet another article that fails to answer the discussion ending point that * they are already in france * . 
  i used to not care about calais and just laughed and rooted for them to get through , but honestly people like the author of that article coupled with careless actions of the migrants themselves has changed my mind . 
  or you could just admit you were wrong . 
  brighton also surely ? 
  anyway , what kind of hassle do you mean ? 
  i can imagine some pricks staring or laughing to their mates but i 'd think there would n't be much worse than that . 
  not in the day time that is . 
  he was driving , so it 's not really any different to testing for alcohol . 
  edit : actually i 'm uncertain whether it means when driving or just in general , if it 's the latter then that is indeed ridiculous and unusual . 
  wow , what a load of shit . 
   the government said it had introduced the charges because it `` considers that convicted adult offenders who use our criminal courts should pay towards the cost of running them '' - reducing the `` burden '' on the taxpayers . 
  they already * are * paying to run them , the people standing trial are taxpaying citizens like anyone else . 
  oh wait no sorry , i forgot , they 're just benefit scrounging scum and not regular people . . oh well , at least we 'll see our taxes reduced now that we do n't have this `` burden '' any more ... yeah right . 
  there are definitely some poshos in scotland , edinburgh comes to mind . 
  you need to provide examples for us to review . 
  same thing happened with the scottish referendum , anything speculative about a negative outcome was rejected as `` fear mongering . '', 
  the problem is how else are you meant to argue for the status quo without pointing out why changing it might be a bad idea ? 
  it 'll be interesting to see how the snp , as a party that wants to remain in the eu , will approach campaigning for that without any hypocrisy in their arguments . 
  what is the point ? 
  i clicked on a random thread and a comment sitting near the top starts with  we have to get rid of the jews , there is no way to coexist with these people . 
  judging from his post history , the uk , but as someone else from there i can safely say it 's not true . 
  for a period about a decade ago some papers went on about poles because the border was opened , but i have n't heard anything like that in years . 
  they are well integrated and generally respected . 
  a more recent `` enemy '' would be romanians and bulgarians , but even that is n't really true and is blown completely out of proportion , some loud voices like the daily mail and ukip went on about them a year or so ago when freedom of movement was opened up to them , but that too died down quickly . 
  i 'm sure you can go to a chocolatier shop in the us somewhere and find decent tasting stuff , but when we 're comparing the regular cheap stuff you find in corner shops ( convenience stores ) the american stuff i 've tried fitted the description of being crap . 
  the british public and the british government are two separate things , the former has no interest at all in what america wants , and since the uk 's future in the eu is being put to a referendum obama 's opinion is of no relevance whatsoever . 
  if it was up to the public we would have [ never went to iraq ] ( https://www.ipsos-mori.com/newsevents/ca/287/iraq-the-last-prewar-polls.aspx ) , no chance at all . 
  the vote was never to do with an invasion , boots on the ground were ruled out , it was to do with air strikes on specific locations to weaken assad . 
  anyway that vote still stands , as we have n't attacked assad , these air strikes are * in * syria but they are on a different target , isis .
