  i would n't be surprised if a yes vote ends up with us another 5 + years in the eu . 
   it was the english -- everyone yesterday, 
  exactly , scotland has gained nothing from the 300 year long union with england . 
  only serfdom and oppression . 
  england the colonial mastermind , scotland stands quite separate from all of england 's failings . 
  just history . 
  it 's popular here to stereotype britain as some sad old country that feels lost without its empire . 
  apparently , we never got over it , and that 's why we hate europe . 
  if anything , i see a strange bitterness towards britain . 
  like , nelson muntz going `` ha ha '' . 
  honestly , it seems like only the irish and the aussies have any knack for making fun of the british . 
  the continentals come off as super preachy holier-than-thou bullshit . 
  or sweden, 
  there is not greater zealot than a recent convert . 
  every . 
  single . 
  week . 
  to get similar figures in the uk , you 'd have to expand the attendance to at least once a year . 
  edit : stats below . 
   58.4 % of the population never attend religious services while only 13.1 % of people report going to a religious service once a week or more . 
   by 2015 , the level of church attendance in the uk is predicted to have fallen to 3,081,500 people , or 5 % of the population . 
  what bullshit is this ? 
  me and my two siblings went to different schools , i went to an academy , and we never ever encountered mandatory anything religious , let alone worship . 
  love the idea , as long as france is not in it . 
  the trick is to give france a good kicking . 
  they can bloody well take it out of france 's cap handout . 
  grrm has pretty much said that it 's based on english history . 
  though i suppose your interpretation is quite interesting . 
   sometimes, 
  you could beat america in the messiah complex stakes . 
  the sad thing is , sometimes even extreme economic problems do n't topple these dictators . 
  ahem ... we have ** the ** queen . 
   ` the united states of america , ** england ** , and europe ' has a pretty nice ring to it . 
  well , there you go scotland , you got your independence . . sort of . 
  what 's with all the french ? 
  can we not get some german on there instead ? 
  i mean they are the real leaders of the eu . 
   god !, 
  there are so many problems , i bet it would all be fixed if this particular ethnic group ceased to exist . 
  - everyone in the 20th century, 
  order and symmetry is part of good aesthetics . 
  something belgians seem to be unaware of . 
  i thought the commie blocks looked bad , then i saw the modern design . 
  outward opening windows are less intrusive in smaller english homes . 
  scottish people voted to stay lol . 
  wow , that 's terrible . 
  sorry about that , i thought poles had a relatively good reputation here . 
   being called polish trash , and treated as such , is not something outside of what i 'd describe as `` normal british behaviour '' . 
  really ? 
  how often have you come across this ? 
  when a good looking young white girl dies or goes missing . 
  the tabloid press often like to sell the `` beautiful/innocent/studious girl killed/kidnapped by evil monster/society '' . 
  whatever angle works best . 
   expence of southern european countries and foreign exporters such as the us , china , japan etc , who face barriers to entry that germany does not . 
  what a stupid chart . 
  just make it flat . 
  it 's about time we do something about the german auto oligopoly . 
  frankly , it seems to me like the eu has enabled german manufacturers an easy market in the eu while preventing competition from the us and japan . 
  would you give a customer the silent treatment over them not saying hello before asking a question ? 
   but yeah , french ca n't even compete with spanish anymore . 
  that 's what i mean , i feel like spanish people are much more relaxed about english when really spanish is the closest `` rival '' ( if that is a thing between languages ) to english . 
  i would expect the spanish to be bitter and the french to be more relaxed about it , it 's not like there was ever that many people in the world speaking french . 
  as a waiter or server , its really quite something to demand people know and respect this minor cultural norm when buying a bloody baguette . 
  the french in general have a very clear linguistic chauvinism . 
  i do n't if they are bitter about french no longer being lingua franca , or the fact that english is what replaced it , but its definitely there . 
  also , some french people definitely think that french is the best language in the world . 
  although , as / u/outrageous _ chausette says its less common these days . 
  the dutch respect their naval history so much , it makes me sad as a brit that we do not . 
  given that the navy was probably even more pivotal for british success . 
  a certain section of america is pants on head retarded ( republicans ) . 
  they would probably starve to death if not for the non-retarded americans keeping them alive . 
  the ladder of brown pants . 
  for those who may not be aware . 
  the thing that made victory , and the royal navy was n't some super clever ship design or superior wood . 
  it was the incredibly training of royal navy sailors . 
  they could fine their guns much faster than their rivals . 
  a ship like victory actually had higher dps than some more heavily armed french and spanish ships because british sailors absolutely pelted them with shots . 
  neither of them will be fighting any battles anytime soon . 
  it 's interesting enough but it 's hilarious how the most famous swedish ship basically pos that could n't float out of the harbour . 
  it 's so bad they named it terrible . 
  sad . 
  formatting . 
  7 ! = 4 , not 7 !, 
   they can really feed their audience anything this has been thing thing in america for a very long time . 
  since the tories came to power we 've seen similar stuff in the uk too . 
  just straight up unfiltered , disgusting lies fed to the masses and eat it up . 
  exactly , fucking taking the piss . 
  60bn my ass . 
  simple is also a loanword in english . 
  numbers ? 
  in the very next two paragraphs it says that it might actually be up on previous estimates . 
   the downward revision appeared to have been prompted by weaker north sea oil and gas production during the first six months of 2016 , and did not reflect the underlying strength of the uk economy , he added . 
   `` excluding oil and gas output , estimated uk gdp growth might actually have been revised up in 2016 , '' added mr hawksworth . 
  so we 're not pulling as much oil out of the north sea as expected , but otherwise might be doing better than the original forecast . 
  i can understand a man being a bit irrational after being in guantanamo , not that i necessarily consider attacking iraqi forces instead of americans to be an irrational act . 
  he 's implying britain is special in having some particularly conservative groups . 
  historically speaking , their fears would have been perfectly justified . 
  britain 's great advantage in the world has always been the channel and the open ocean . 
  something that makes the channel less significant would be instinctively undesirable to brits of that time . 
  people do n't seem to realise , but just like russia , britain has a deep psychological disconnect with continental europe .
