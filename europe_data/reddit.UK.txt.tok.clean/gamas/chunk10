  if you think politicians are susceptible to lobbyists , the media are even more so . . not to mention the `` great '' murdoch empire that dominates british media ... 
   we all know there 's a very real possibility of a scottish republic becoming reality in the next year or so actually scotland 's independence proposal is to keep the monarchy . . yeah . . 
  it 's stronger because the representatives are better informed . 
  because of their qualification and experience they know how to best consider all the ramifications of implementing their decisions . 
  the problem with direct democracy is that discrimination would be worse . 
  gay marriage or lgbt rights in general would n't have stood a chance if the decision was up to the majority . 
  representative democracy does fall foul of some of the same issues but its better because at least the decisions are informed whilst being vaguely what the general public wants . 
  it gives the freedom of direct democracy whilst giving some of the benefits of meritocracy . 
  in fairness , direct democracy has its bad points . 
  the problem is that letting the people decide is only good if the people actually know what is good for them . 
  the fears people have with the eu referendum are more that people are going to vote to exit the eu without fully understanding the ramifications of the decision . 
  they will see the hyperbole the crappy uk newspaper spew saying that the eu is banning paperclips or some nonsense , and see farage being all like `` bloody foreigners , coming over here stealing our jobs and our women '' . 
  they will fail to see all the benefits the eu brings such as open borders , cheap travel in europe , the huge trade and economic advantage . 
  in its purest form , direct democracy is mob rule by the ignorant . 
  in fairness they say `` nearly a century '' ago . 
  getting technical about how many years `` nearly '' constitutes is just nitpicking . . 
  putting a bunch of flammable items next to a combustion engine - ca n't see what could possibly go wrong ... 
  yes , germans were nazis or sheep ... look , in italy or spain we did n't commit genocide because we just do n't follow orders like you do . 
  you know apart from that whole thing with francesco franco and mussolini ... 
  technically a democracy is quality assurance for politicians ... the problem is we also need quality assurance for the voters ... 
   only as long as there are free country from where to host the contents . 
  sealand would suddenly become the most economically rich small nation on earth ... 
  even if it was n't , this is the uk we 're talking about . 
  the tories/ukip would bitch and moan until there was a star put on the legislation saying the uk is exempt ... 
  the closest i can think of to something serious is the whole prince harry naked vegas incident - but that 's not a special privilege for royalty , in that case it was determined to be a breach of privacy ( though granted they probably got faster treatment due to royalty ) . 
  also people have been freely stating conspiracy theories ( including my former english teacher years ago ) suggesting that the royal house was somehow involved in princess diana 's death ever since it happened ... 
   does the uk have laws defending the ` honor ' of the monarchs ? 
  that 's one thing that to me is incompatible with a free society that happens with spain 's monarchs : you ca n't legally make fun of them . 
  most of our comedians spend their time taking the piss out of prince philip ( oh that lovable yet racist old man ) and doing impersonations of the queen ( including a [ twitter account ] ( https://twitter.com/queen_uk ) ) . 
  so i 'd say if there is a law we definitely do n't enforce it . 
  greece is probably not the best reference . 
  in its entire modern history , greece has always had a bit of a nationalistic streak and the hatred of albanians is probably more because they make up the majority of the immigrants in greece ( most recent estimate suggest 60-65 % of immigrants are albanian ) rather than any rational reason . 
  to balance it out , its the same attitude that britain seems to have towards the polish . . 
  homosexual male here - i think all scandinavian guys are hot ... 
  still you have to imagine what it must have been like for the english men at the time : `` huzzah we finally ended the viking reign of tyranny , we 're free - oh for the love of ... '', 
   brutal slaughter and pillaging of english monasteries in the viking age ( or maybe it is n't omitted , it 's just told as if it 's somehow cool and respectable ) . 
  it 's okay , we tend not to mention the slaughter and pillaging of the vikings either ... just that we managed to finally get rid of the ( now norwegian ) vikings in the battle of stamford bridge only to get our ass handed to us 19 days later by the normans ... 
  when i was in school i remember quite a bit of talk about anglo-saxon forts ... 
  ** things that are emphasised ** * the fact that most of our major roads roughly follow the original roman roads . 
  * for some reason the battle of hastings ( if only for `` well we had a good strategy '' ) * the entire war of the roses * martin luther 's role in the reformation * the fact that henry viii was a ( literally ) massive hedonist who had 6 wives and that his reign brought about the reformation in england . 
  emphasis on anne boleyn and the fact she was executed for having 6 fingers . 
  * elizabeth i 's entire reign with a big part on the spanish armada ( with an opportunity taken to emphasise how awesome our ships were at this point ) ... and of course shakespeare 's entire life * the english civil war and the resulting role it had in reforming our parliament - of course guy fawkes gets an honourable mention * a big focus on the american slave revolts and the resulting civil war ... with an after-remark pointing out that we had abolished slavery before then and had managed to do so without almost tearing our country apart . 
  * holy crap we now own a quarter of the world - also pirates . 
  * the industrial revolution and how we basically invented a lot of things ( huge shout out to trains ) and became the world 's greatest superpower . 
  and victoria was quite awesome . 
  * wwi and why we wear a poppy on remembrance day , and how the demand of the war meant women had to take on the jobs of the men , at which point we realised women actually had a place in society . 
  * the great depression and how expensive it was to buy a loaf of bread * ww2 - the london blitz , churchill being awesome , hitler 's background , the normandy landings and the later battle of normandy , and then hitler 's death . 
  finish off with horoshima and the revelations of the holocaust - followed by the nuremberg trials . 
  * how the debt from the two world wars pretty much destroyed the empire . 
  ** things less emphasised ** * why we actually went to war with france constantly . 
  from what we were taught all we could gather is that france and england would get bored occasionally and decided to have a fight for shits and giggles ... * nothing mentioned about our role in the crusades * i do n't remember a lot of talk about ireland ... * almost nothing about the american revolution , just that the americans revolted , we lost and hence why the usa exists . 
  * almost nothing about how we managed to conquer a quarter of the earth ... * how technically the united kingdom came about because the scottish inherited the english throne ... * how we ended up with wales, 
  seems to be one of the few countries in the eu to have anywhere close to britain 's level of euroscepticism ... 
  along with the other scandinavian countries has , what i consider to be , one of the best economic models i 've come across in terms of helping its poor ( yeah things are much more expensive but then again wages are a lot higher as well ) . 
  seems to share a similar sense of humour with us . 
  has some of the best pastries ( although technically they originated in vienna ) . 
  as a native english speaker , english is a confusing and f ` ed up language . . edit : in english , y is like schr\u00f6dinger 's cat - until it is observed it is both a vowel and not a vowel at the same time . 
  so basically we can blame the danes for all the difficulties in applying formal language theory to mainstream programming languages ? 
   in scotland eu students * are entitled to free university , etc. 
  * unless the eu student happens to be english =p, 
  i think it 's an issue of cultural blindness . 
  the further away something is to what we are familiar with , the harder we find it to make distinctions . 
  for example , we find it very easy to uniquely identify every person we come across , but find it very difficult to tell the difference between different rats . 
  similarly , we 've all heard at least one person in our lifetimes who claims that all chinese people look the same . 
  and likewise in china , you can bet there are people who think all westerners look the same . 
  when it comes to reporting about the us , we always refer to them as americans . 
  but when you look at us media reporting they tend to refer to bostonians , floridians etc. 
  but then you will see us media just call everyone in europe a european ( with exception of britain , which is much more exposed as part of american culture ) . 
  tl ; dr we as humans are only very good at noticing subtle differences when we are constantly exposed to it . 
  we 're so used to them sending serious entries . 
  as a brit , i like this more cynical side to them . 
  graham norton pretty much said it . 
  eric : `` you 're probably wondering why i am here '' graham : `` yes . 
  yes we are . '', 
  we may submit consistently bad acts but at least we can pride ourselves in sarcastic commentary . 
  it 's more likely people who were n't going to vote anyway but felt guilty about it , so lied and said who they would have aligned with . 
  this is partly caused by the fact that labour has kinda brought on apathy amongst its own supporters by having being seemingly lacking in any kind of direction for the past 5 years ... 
  i was trying to recall the actual study on the what went wrong and [ it 's actually even worse ] ( http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-resources/why-did-the-polls-go-wrong-by-jon-mellon-and-chris-prosser/#.vafllvlvhbe ) . 
  it was n't just labour people saying they were going to vote labour and not voting , it was labour people not voting then lying about the fact they did n't vote . 
  ( another reason was that they had n't correctly weighted the age groups , and , as a result , younger age groups were over-represented ( which has become more pertinent now that there is a wider gap between the young and old demographics ) ) . 
  the analysis of what went wrong concluded that this time we had the inverse of the `` shy tory effect '' - an `` apathetic labour '' effect ( i.e. 
  people who said they would vote labour but then just simply did n't vote ) . 
  edit : this was also combined with the fact that the snp surge and the general split of the uk vote amongst more minor parties was unprecedented in uk politics and thus threw a lot of polling calculations off . 
  looking at the opinion polls - is n't it worrying that golden dawn are currently the third most popular party ? 
  it sounds like ce/bce is your trigger ... 
  is a pretty awesome game , although i 'm currently trying to play as najd and it 's really difficult . 
  i mean we could talk about video games , the weather and the price of cheese if you want , but the reality is that in a geographic subreddit , the main things people will talk about is culture and political persuasions . 
  honestly , i think it is nothing more sinister than inexperience . 
  remember , syriza is n't some established party , it is a party that only became a credible opposition in 2012 , and rose to the power for the first time in 2015 . 
  whilst the three years in opposition was enough time to develop their ideology beyond green sky thinking , it certainly would n't be enough to understand the harsh realities of government . 
  he went into the negotiations thinking that the eurozone would n't let greece fail , this led to most of the mistakes . 
  regarding the referendum , one article analysed that tsipras hope had probably been that when the greek people said `` no '' , the euro markets would tumble , indicating that greece was too important to fail . 
  in reality , the markets barely flickered - and it was at this point tsipras realised he had no hand to play , and folded , realising he was out of depths . 
  that 's why he got french advisors in to help draw up the reform proposals . 
  his plan now is probably to play ball with his creditors . 
  prove to them that he is willing to take the economy seriously , and that he can push through the necessary reforms . 
  in a few years time when syriza have more experience running a country and shown their creditors they can be trusted , then he hopes to get back to the negotiating table and say `` see , we have done what you have asked and we 're improving greece , you can trust us to implement the reforms that we want '' . 
  whether that works depends on how successful greece is doing at that point , and how developed syriza 's proposals are . 
  the reason negotiations failed this time is because all the creditors saw was a bunch of idealists with no concrete plan for how to reform greece . 
  this is syriza 's turning point , the moment they realise they ca n't just get what they want simply by having a dream - that they need a detailed and thorough long-term plan on how to work towards that dream .
