  it 's exactly this , the reason the greeks maintain their faith in syriza is n't because they believe they are doing good , but because they believe they are trying to do good - and that is all that matters . 
  and that 's okay , when he wants to go leftist , his party will back him unanimously , and when he needs to do what he must in order to meet creditors ' demands , nd/pasok are enough to push him through . 
  he maintains his majority because he does n't need syriza to back him unanimously to get his bills through . 
   it was ** labor ** and liberal democrats \\* twitch \\* but seriously , i do n't think gay marriage would have been legalised had the conservatives not been in coalition with the lib dems . 
  although the lib dems were the minor party , the tories had to throw them some bones else the lib dems would tear apart the agreement . 
   divorce does n't obliterate the link between marriage and family . 
  which backward part of the uk do you live that you have never come across successful families brought up without marriage ? 
  the majority of people have not thought of there being a link between marriage and family for a long time ... only hardline christians and conservatives give a shit about marriage as an institution for raising a family , everyone else has been happily raising children without marriage for a while ... 
  the uk has the liberal democrat party which is quite literally a merger between the old liberal and briefly formed social democratic party . 
  that conflict is n't really a conflict , it 's more just professional trolling on the fyrom side . 
  there are specialist wines designed for cooking ... this was n't one of them . 
  you do n't go pouring a vintage bottle into a bolognese ... 
  greek wines do n't really get imported that much in the uk , you have to be actively looking for it in order to find it . 
  it can be a bit of an acquired taste as it tastes very different from the usual wines . 
  it usually has much stronger flavour than most wines , it almost has a hint of a cinnamon-like feel to it . 
  as the other poster said , the best way to describe it is that it tends to taste like christmas ( though that is not exclusive to retsina ) . 
  my ex used to bring over some bottles from his parents ' vineyard , though he always ended up using it for cooking rather than drinking , which i used to berate him for as it was a wine that drank too well to be wasted in a fucking spaghetti bolognese ... ( and apparently his parents did when they found out he was using wine for cooking rather than drink saying `` we did n't give you these bottles just to waste it on food ! '' ), 
  yes but irish-americans still support the ira , the overseas diasporas tend to be more nationalistic than their homeland counterparts . 
  honestly , i buy greek wine over italian and french wine because i love the taste and texture . 
  you guys should export that stuff more . 
  you mean vauxhall right ? 
  well they are also neo-nazis with a fixation on the the 19th century megali idea , and some claims that they are receiving funds from russia ... so at the very least , in the event of a golden dawn government , turkey should be looking at reinforcing their guard of the mamara and aegean regions , lest they start spotting some russian speaking greeks wanting separation ... 
  what i mean is , it should be up to the people of the country losing its sovereignty to decide whether to give up its sovereignty . 
  i could never imagine a fair federation where the member states become members against their own will . 
  the people wanting federalism , want democratic federalism . 
  a takeover through economic blackmail is not the same as becoming a member state through democratic mandate . 
  by the will of the democratic majority . 
  the only acceptable form of federalism is one in which the states involves voted to be there . 
  takeover by force is wrong . 
  `` eleftheria i thanatos '' has never been a more relevant national motto ... 
  honestly , i am now genuinely rooting for syriza 's response being to stick a middle finger up , telling the eu to go fuck themselves with that suggestion whilst directing them to the greek national motto and reminding them of the lyrics of the greek national anthem . 
  if greece held an election right now , syriza would actually increase its majority . 
  the greeks are n't as stupid as the media likes to portray them , they knew they were electing a party that had absolutely no experience running a country . 
  they did n't elect syriza thinking that they could achieve miracles and cause pigs to fly and rainbows to stretch from macedonia to crete . 
  most people who voted syriza knew they 'd eventually have to cave to the troika 's demands because syriza just does n't have the upper hand . 
  they voted syriza because they ( correctly ) identified what was fundamentally wrong with greece to begin with - a morally bankrupt political establishment that cared more about protecting the upper classes , than doing what was right for the people . 
  the only way greece could ever begin to heal was to cut out the disease that caused the illness in the first place . 
  put this into perspective - nd/pasok were so fundamentally corrupt and spineless , that the greeks would rather risk economic bankruptcy by putting a completely inexperienced party in charge , than continue to have a morally bankrupt government . 
  as for the fiasco over the past two weeks with syriza rejecting a deal and then subsequently making a more austere deal as greece tips over the deal , it makes more sense when you consider one aspect of greek culture . 
  every year on the 28th october , greece celebrates an event dubbed `` no day '' . 
  this is the anniversary of the date that the greek dictator rejected an ultimatum made by mussolini to allow axis forces military axis in greece . 
  the result was that mussolini then invaded greece and ultimately annexed it . 
  even though in many senses it was a loss for the greeks , it is celebrated because it is a demonstration of greek defiance even in the face of almost certain defeat . 
  that i believe is what happened here , if syriza had caved earlier and accepted the reforms before the imf deadline , then this would have been seen as a betrayal of what they stand for . 
  but by remaining adamant and only accepting reform only when greece was literally about to topple over the cliff , it looks less like betrayal , and more like fighting to the bitter end but ultimately losing . 
  because the european rules have always been strictly followed and never bent ... 
  yeah i had a bit of read up on our own government and realised we actually do have a bunch of positions that are precisely called `` director '' which are all civil servant roles . 
  exactly , worst case scenario is that greece will permanently be in the state of being `` in the process '' of being suspended without ever actually being suspended . 
  in the uk , most ministries are headed by a cabinet minister supported by a team of junior ministers , along with special advisors ( who are essentially party loyal civil servants ) , and civil servants . 
  for example our ministry of education is headed by conservative mp , nick morgan , who has 6 conservative junior ministers under her . 
  this is with exception to a group of departments whose roles are to act as an independent regulatory or inspection body . 
  so the bodies in charge of inspecting schools to ensure they are up to standards or serious fraud investigation , or our equivalent of inland revenue . 
  ** but ** , having had a look at our government website , it seems we do have director roles in the ministries , and these are independent civil servants . 
  in fact , the director general in the ministry of education , who was appointed in 2014 , was in fact a former spokesperson for labour before becoming a civil servant . 
  ( obviously though , no-one ever gives a shit about them because all people care about are the political decisions ), 
  so in uk parliament terms , would this be equivalent to the head of the ministry , the `` special advisors '' , or just plain civil servants ? 
  like i am sitting here thinking `` why would n't the head of a ministry be someone from the ruling party ? '', 
  [ oddly greece has a bit of a tradition involving that word ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ohi_day ), 
  that greek flag is overcompensating for something . 
  i guess as a symbol of solidarity behind greece ? 
  honestly the eu should just adopt the uk approach to deadlines - just have one deadline that is constantly being pushed back by a decade . 
   article 7 teu allows for sanctioning a member state that is in serious breach of the treaties . 
  these sanctions can include a suspension of any and all membership rights of that country in the eu , including voting rights . 
  unanimity , other than the offending country , is required to declare a breach of the treaties , while qualified majority is required to decide on sanctions . 
  and this is something that the eu will do only if it wants a unilateral surge in anti-eu parties across europe . 
  no matter how convoluted treaties are to make everything technically okay , from the perspective of the people , you 'd be sending the message that is one rule for one country and another rule for the next . 
  why should greece be forced out of the eu for not the other 10 non-eurozone eu member states ? 
  yes they 've got special exceptions yadayada and what not , but that 's just legal detail . 
  people are n't going to care about that , all they will see is hypocrisy . 
  in those 10 countries you 'd start getting people asking the question `` hang on if greece was kicked out for not having the euro , what does that mean for us ? '' . 
  and within the eurozone , you 'd have people suddenly realising they have lost their sovereignty - it 's the eu 's way or the highway . 
  so yes whilst they could sanction greece for not having the euro , it would be a politically unwise move for anyone wishing to maintain the eu ... 
  i mean its pretty much the only reason gove keeps getting employed . 
  i dunno if greek tv is regulated , but if it is n't , then what happened is no different to what happens in newspaper in the uk during elections and referendums ... during our most recent election , almost every newspaper ( as nearly all newspapers are owned by the same guy ) supported the conservatives . 
   i 've lost an epic amount of respect for / r/europe over this crisis . 
  you are supposed to be the sophisticated , intelligent ones who have the intellectual wherewithall to step back and look at this crisis objectively . 
  if you were looking for intelligence in / r/europe , you are sorely mistaken . 
  this is the subreddit of `` why ca n't we just simply tell islam and the gypsies to fuck off '' , `` we should just sink the migrant boats '' , and `` eurgh , why ca n't the greeks just starve and die already '' . 
  ( i would say though , i think you mean that greece should never have been in the euro , not that it should n't be in the eu . 
  it absolutely should be in the eu . 
  however the decision that it was in the right conditions to enter the eurozone were false ( as they were based on nd/pasok 's fudged numbers ) ), 
  as the other poster said , [ the ec were literally pushing for greeks to vote for their approved candidates , who just so happened to be the guys who got greece in this mess in the first place ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/euro-finance/european-commission-officially-backs-government-candidate-greek-elections ) . 
  yes the greeks are ultimately responsible for electing them in previous elections , but for fucks sake , nd and pasok had been hiding how fucked greece was from the electorate for almost two decades ... 
  nd and pasok spent 20 years committing wide scale fraud , including hiding greece 's debt in order to enter the eurozone , and let the last government to fall apart because they were too arrogant to pick a president who is accepted by the government , and yet the troika actively pushed for them to be voted for in the last election . 
  how is this `` keeping politicians in check '' ? 
  to me the very issue was that the eu were basically pushing to preserve the status quo , they were letting the corrupt politicians continue to be corrupt because `` hey at least they 'll tow our line when they want money '' . 
  i believe this was the reason most left wing and green parties used to be thoroughly against the eu . 
  they turned towards it because the eu seemed to be representing the goal of unity and harmony , but this renewed right wing factionalism has started pushing people away from it again . 
  one of the more confusing aspects ( for english speakers ) of the greek language is the fact that ` ne ' means yes . 
  from what i can tell , syriza have their logic in check and have experience in individual components that would be useful for running a government . 
  but having only become a major party in the past 4 years , they lack experience in the whole package of running a country . 
  they know all the pieces but do n't know how to fit everything together . 
  hence they make stupid errors in terms of diplomacy . . 
  it 's just unfortunate that an inexperienced party came in at the most critical point of greece 's crisis ... 
   i could imagine that the imf is getting screwed over a bit by the whole charade . 
  but who knows . 
  on the other hand , [ even the imf knew that they were never going to get their money back ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-troika-analysis-says-significant-concessions-still-needed ), 
  then we 'd raise 7.4 billion euros ... which would be more than enough to secure greece 's bailout funds and the next couple of payments , but not enough to save greece . 
  and part of the issue with greece in the first place - they got in by getting goldmann & sachs to fudge the numbers to make it look like they met the entry criteria . 
  china is a weird one , it is never quite clear whether they are actually playing the realpolitik game or not .
