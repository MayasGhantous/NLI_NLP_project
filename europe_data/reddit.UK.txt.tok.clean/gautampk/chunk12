  thats silly and confusing . 
  consider myself corrected . 
  the + / - are not ratings , they 're a forecast of how the rating might change in the future . 
  if the rating is like the gradient of gdp ( or specifically the chance of a positive gradient ) , then the + / - is the gradient of the rating . 
  never said he was a good choice , did i ? 
  i think he realises that by winning he actually lost . 
  he was just waiting for another leave mp to run ( i.e. , gove ) so that he could drop out without facing accusations from the leave campaign . 
  the problem is that the people who voted for ( a ) did n't fully realise the consequences of their actions , including a smaller uk economy , scotland leaving , protracted negotiations . 
  of course , much of this could be solved by remaining in the eea , but that 's almost the same as ignoring the referendum completely . 
  but people also think farage , the man who made his money in investment banking , is n't part of the establishment . 
  they 're using the polls from yougov and the like which do gather information on education and socio-economic background . 
  its parent corporation , channel four television corp , is wholly owned by the department for culture , media , and sport . 
  it does n't receive any government funding like the bbc does , but it 's still state owned . 
  but it 's not going to win many british votes :p it 'll probably make many remain voters balk . 
  this would have been rapidly spun as ` look more federalisation ' by the leave campaign . 
  which , to be fair , is exactly what it is . 
  that 's a pretty good compromise . 
  if a border state does n't want to introduce border controls , then basically the schengen border moves back to the states which are willing to introduce controls . 
  i do n't see why they should n't be allowed to do this . 
  people are free to publish their own opinions if they want to . 
  the only reason the bbc , itv , and channel 4 do n't do this is because the bbc and channel 4 are state owned and so are mandated to be neutral , and itv was mandated to be neutral as part of allowing it to exist . 
  newer tv stations are n't neutral . 
  that would be amazing . 
  we should totally do morris dancers . 
  if it goes badly we 'd just be embracing how badly we do anyway . 
  the jury votes were so overtly political this year . 
  you could work out how many points ukraine would get based on a country 's proximity to russia . 
  i want someone to follow this formula exactly next year and see what happens . 
  not allowed ` local , regional or provincial flags ' that are n't the official national flag of one of the countries . 
  presumably it 's an egalitarian way of banning the catalonian and basque flags . 
  these are my thoughts on the eu legislative and executive branches . 
  feel free to correct me if i made any errors ... as far as i can tell , right now the procedure is that the european commission ( ec ) proposes a law ( and are basically the only organisation with the right to legislative initiative ) to the european parliament ( ep , the lower house ) . 
  then the ep votes on this . 
  after this , the proposal is passed to the council of the european union ( ceu , essentially the upper house ) . 
  if the ceu approves the proposal , then it becomes a law ( regulation , directive or decision ) . 
  alternatively , the ceu can amend the proposal and give it back to the ep . 
  the ec gives its opinion , and the ep then votes again , if it approves this second reading the proposal becomes law . 
  if the ep rejects the proposal , then it has failed . 
  or the ep can amend the proposal again ( creating a third reading ) and send it back to the ceu . 
  again , the ec gives its position . 
  if the ec has rejected the ep 's amendments , the ceu needs to vote unanimously , or the proposal fails . 
  however , if it takes more than three months for the ceu to come to a decision , then the presidents of the ceu and ep from the conciliation committee to come up with a version agreeable to both sides within six weeks , or else the thing fails . 
  this fourth reading is then passes back to the ep and ceu , who both need to approve it ( by majority ) for the proposal to become law . 
  then there are other procedures . 
  the consultation procedure and consent procedures are a travesty to democratic process . 
  they are akin to the house of lords forcing through legislation in the uk . 
  then there 's the eu version of royal prerogative/executive powers , which is the ec acting alone or with the advice of the ceu only . 
  in my opinion , several things need to change about this . 
  firstly , let 's draw parallels between the eu institutions and national-level institutions : * ** the european council ** this is the eu 's collective head of state . 
  basically our equivalent of the us president . 
  it comprises of all the heads of state/government in the eu . 
  it does n't have any legislative power , but `` sets the agenda '' . 
  * ** the european commission ** this is the government . 
  it proposes the majority of the legislation , implements policy and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the eu . 
  the commissioners are basically the cabinet , and the commission president is basically the head of government ( prime minister ) . 
  * ** the council of the european union ** our senate . 
  the upper house of the eu legislature . 
  the main parallel to be drawn with the us senate is that of equal representation . 
  every eu country has exactly one seat in the ceu , regardless of population . 
  the president of the ceu chairs the meetings ; setting the agenda and making sure everything runs smoothly . 
  * ** the european parliament ** the house of representatives , except more democratic . 
  the lower house of the eu legislature . 
  the ep is one of the best eu institutions . 
  it is represents the second largest single democracy in the world ( after india ) , and is proper democratic ( by which i mean it uses prop . 
  rep. ) . 
  the ep president is the speaker . 
  * ** the european civil service ** fairly self-explanatory . 
  does what it says on the tin really . 
  they mostly work for the commission . 
  the composition and organisation are actually fine . 
  it 's just the procedure which is bad . 
  firstly , the naming . 
  it 's terrible , at least in english . 
  there are two completely separate institutions called councils here , and add to that the nothing-to-do-with-the-eu council of europe , it 's a right bloody mess . 
  also , calling the lower house a parliament is just wrong . 
  parliament refers to both the upper and lower houses * together * . 
  i would : * rename `` the council of the european union '' to be `` the upper house of the european parliament '' or maybe `` the european senate '' . 
  maybe the latter sounds too american though :p . * rename `` the european parliament '' to be `` the lower house of the european parliament '' . 
  or , if you prefer the american theme , `` the european house of representatives '' . 
  * the `` european parliament '' would be the upper and lower houses taken together . 
  next , the legislative powers : * ** meps and the upper house should be given the right to legislative initiative ** every other democratic institution has these private member 's bill procedures . 
  * ** all proposals should start in the lower house ** this is normal for most democracies . 
  the upper house is more for expertise . 
  the lower house better represents the absolute will of the people , and it should have more power . 
  * ** the upper house should act as advisers , nothing more ** again , this is fairly normal . 
  the house of lords ca n't override the commons . 
  the senate ca n't override the house ( except in exceptional circumstances ) . 
  the upper house is made up of the relevant cabinet ministers of all members states . 
  they can provide expertise , but that does n't change the fact that the lower house is the will of the people . 
  * ** the consultation and consent procedures should be scrapped ** they 're just bad democracy . 
  also , the commission acting alone should be scrapped . 
  * ** ordinary legislative procedure ** this is what i described earlier . 
  i think it should be amended as follows : 1 . 
  a proposal ( either a private members thing , or from the commission ) is submitted to the lower house . 
  the lower house either rejects the proposal outright , or submits a first reading to the upper house . 
  if the upper house accepts the first reading , the proposal passes . 
  otherwise , the upper house submits a second reading to the lower house . 
  the upper house ca n't reject the proposal . 
  if the lower house accepts the second reading , the proposal passes . 
  otherwise , the lower house either rejects the proposal outright , or submits a third reading to the upper house .
