  if the upper house accepts the third reading , the proposal passes . 
  otherwise , the conciliation committee is convened . 
  the upper house ca n't at this point amend or reject the proposal . 
  the conciliation committee has 6 weeks to create a mutually agreeable fourth reading . 
  if no decision is made after 6 weeks , the third reading is sent to the lower house . 
  otherwise the fourth reading is sent . 
  the lower house votes on the result of the conciliation committee . 
  if the lower house accepts the result , the proposal passes , otherwise it fails . 
  the key differences between this and the current procedure are that the commission has no involvement after they submit the proposal . 
  this is essentially because they are n't democratically elected like the upper and lower houses . 
  also , the upper house can not , at any point , reject a proposal . 
  conversely , the lower house has this power at every step . 
  this basically gives much more power to the lower house , which is how it should be . 
  then , executive powers . 
  this is stuff like budgeting , monetary policy , foreign policy . 
  stuff that usually would n't need a vote in a parliament : * executive decisions should be ** made by the commission ** and ** approved by the upper house ** acting by qualified majority . 
  they should only involve the upper house because these decisions will typically affect all member states equally , and so all member states should have an equal vote . 
  the composition of the upper house will vary as it currently does . 
  for example , if they 're deciding foreign policy , then the upper house will be made up of all the foreign ministers . 
  * the relevant powers should be explicitly granted by a law passed by the eu legislature , or by treaty . 
  * the european council ( i.e. , the eu head of state ) should have a veto . 
  so , those are my thoughts . 
  i know it 's a bit long , but i wanted other people 's opinions on it . 
  here in the uk we do n't have a party aligned with the epp . 
  instead , our conservative party created their own group , the ecr . 
  now , with the elections coming up , i 'm wondering who the ecr will support in the commission presidency thing . 
  do you think it will be the epp candidate ? 
  all the candidates seem to be federalist at least to some degree , whereas the ecr was essentially created to oppose federalism , so i 'm unsure . 
  i 've always thought of ` european ' as an ethnicity rather than a nationality . 
  yeah so not her personally . 
  it 's like a building owned by a company is ` owned ' by the shareholders , but they do n't get to take it with them when they stop being a shareholder . 
  she owns sandringham and balmoral personally though . 
  i thought windsor was owned by the crown , not the family themselves . 
  plenty of stately homes ( some of which are converted castles ) are still owned by the original families . 
  i think most of them are used as a tourist attraction with the family now living in a smaller estate ( that 's still probably bloody massive ) somewhere else . 
  but some of the smaller ones are still used as residences entirely . 
  the historic houses association is an association of private people and organisations that own stately homes and historic buildings , but be aware that some of the buildings listed are probably owned by companies rather than families : http://www.hha.org.uk, 
  no , even the very religious people i know do n't . 
  some people wear a small cross on a necklace , but that 's about it . 
  i think christian iconography is more of a catholic/orthodox thing . 
  it 's the same here . 
  scotland has a lower limit but they 're both so low now that they 're effectively zero tolerance . 
  learn german . 
  you just need to be better at it before native speakers will speak it back to you . 
  obviously if you 're speaking in broken words they wo n't reply in german because there 's very little chance you 'll actually understand what they 're saying . 
  remember speaking and listening are two related but separate skills when it comes to language learning . 
  i understand that , and i am mostly being facetious , but the reasons and emotions behind the vote are kind of beside the point here . 
  that fact is 38 % of the country voted to leave . 
   also , to fact check , actually 38 % of the people who voted voted leave  ** about ** 40 %, 
  about as undemocratic to force my household to leave when we all voted to remain by 100 % - 0 % . 
  maybe i should proclaim the republic of gautampk ? 
  on a more serious note , one can say something like ` scotland voted to remain ' , but in reality about 40 % of the country did vote to leave . 
  is it not undemocratic to force those people to stay ? 
  this is the problem with direct democracy . 
  unlike representative democracy , it 's a solution to a problem that does n't exist . 
  democracy is n't the be all and end all of everything , and you ca n't really just say ` it 's more democratic ' as an argument in favour of something ( be it referenda or the queen ) . 
  most people here talk about hourly wage or annual salary . 
  never heard anyone talk about weekly or monthly amounts . 
   i 'm not sure you can blame either campaign for that . 
  [ oh ] ( http://www.channel4.com/media/images/channel4/c4-news/2014/april/21/21_ukip_poster_w.jpg ) [ yes ] ( http://www.channel4.com/media/c4-news/images/730_wide_images/21_3poster.jpg ) [ you can ] ( https://dailyelection.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/img_3430.jpg ) . 
  also , they do n't have to read it directly for the general message to get through to them . 
  if the media had n't over-focussed on calling all leave voters racist and actually looked at some of the other legitimate reasons for leaving ( like the litany that small business owners have ) then the actual racists would have never felt like so many people agreed with them . 
  well it 's always difficult with hinduism to define where the religion stops and just ` indian culture ' begins , and it 's complicated by the fact that it 's perfectly possible to practice hinduism and also be an atheist ( one of the orthodox schools of hinduism actively denies the existence of god , for example , and another two openly question it ) . 
  however , if you accept that hinduism is a religion , it 's clear ( at least to me ) that yoga has it 's traceable roots in religion . 
  some of the first mentions of yoga are in the vedas which are well accepted as religous documents . 
  the primary document of hatha yoga ( which is the physical practice most people call yoga -- yoga itself is actually an orthodox school of hinduism ) states that it is a gift from the god shiva . 
  it 's also clear that basically everyone who practiced it was a hindu , because most people were in india in the 1400s . 
  now i guess we can argue about whether they practiced it for religous reasons or not , but to be honest most people back then only practised religion because someone told them to rather than for any spiritual reason . 
  it may not be religious in origin , but it was religous for hundreds of years before it became a secular thing . 
  most ` religous ' things have roots in non-religous thought , they were just things that it was considered useful for a society to have , and then they became enshrined in religion as a way to ensure people did the things . 
  why do you disagree with the christmas analogy ? 
  yoga is absolutely religious in origin and there are plenty of hindus who still practice it as part of their religion . 
  it 's like christmas . 
  just because most people who celebrate it are n't religious , does n't mean it is n't religious in origin or that there are n't people who celebrate it religiously . 
  it 's not opressing women that most people actually care about . 
  that 's just what they say to themselves so they do n't feel racist . 
  really it 's the identity issue and it has nothing to do with race so i do n't see why they feel racist thinking it . 
  i have the same reaction to someone wearing a balaclava . 
  i do n't like them ( the clothing not the person ) , and i would n't speak to someone wearing one unless they removed it . 
  no , because all countries have cultural norms that are n't enshrined in law . 
  for example , leaving work in the middle of the day to go and pray is not normal in the uk . 
  on the flip side wearing a salwar in the uk is fine because the uk has a long relationship with cultures who wear them regularly so it 's normalised , especially in big cities . 
  i 've noticed that people particularly have an issue with it if it adversely affects them in some way . 
  if a jewish person refuses to work on a saturday even though in the normal rota everyone has to take some saturday shifts . 
  conversely , some of the parades hindus do do n't adversely affect other people so they might be fine with as long as it 's done in a busy area that is usually noisy . 
  for example , people might be rightly upset if it happens in a sleepy village or it goes on until 1am like they do in india sometimes . 
  other than actual american franchise ( like mcd or subway ) there are loads in london : bodeans does bbq stuff , there 's ed 's diner which does diner stuff ( and there are a few smaller chains/independent restaurants with a diner theme too ) . 
  not much beyond that though . 
  in the uk american food = american diner food , at least from a popular point of view . 
  well that and the first three commas . 
  rest seems fine . 
  * its grammar . 
  lemonade is fizzy water flavoured like lemons . 
  a bit like sprite , except sprite has lime and other stuff in it as well . 
  it 's colourless and very artificial . 
  the still non-fizzy stuff is called ` still lemonade ' . 
  you also get ` cloudy lemonade ' which may or may not be fizzy , but is cloudy and made with actual lemons . 
  in case you were n't aware , mcdonald 's is as ubiquitous in germany as it is anywhere in the developed world . 
  you 're talking about engagement rings , not wedding rings . 
  engagement rings here are generally like the us : fancy and with diamonds or other gems .
