  occasionally there are crises like the current eu referendum one in the uk , but things generally turn out okay . 
  from what i can tell , that seems to be the general way the media works in most english-speaking countries . 
  is it not like that elsewhere ? 
  but those things do n't have easy solutions . 
  the vacuum thing does -- all we need to do is leave the eu !, 
  we do n't need to disband anything , that 's not the issue . 
  the issue is getting member states to agree on what needs to be done , rather than getting the troops to do it . 
  ah , i can live with that :p, 
  a bit arch ? 
  so we think we 're the least arrogant * and * the most compassionate . 
  how not-arrogant of us :p . 
  i do n't think i could ever go into banking . 
  too soul destroying . 
  that 's basically a description of my career plan right now :p, 
  physics  going into second year in next month . 
  what about yourself ? 
  ah , really ? 
  i did n't know that . 
  that 's quite interesting ... as an aside , the imperial jcr is currently exclusively made up of far eastern students now . 
  i wonder why so many people go to cyprus after getting qualifications in the uk ( excl . 
  ireland ) ? 
  or does this data not exclude retirees ? 
  what 's the correct demonym for eu citizens then ? 
  european unionite ? 
  european unionish ? 
  eusian ? 
  they suck well enough to clean my house , why do they need to suck any more ? 
  buy a new one . 
  you do n't have to replace the filter as often as you need to replace the bags . 
  to be fair , it was quite a while ago and it did n't do any fancy compressing things . 
  i 'm going to have to buy a new cleaner in september anyway , so i 'll see what 's best ahah . 
  well , when my parents had a bagged vac we had to change the bag after every vacuum ... 
  but then you have to buy new bags . 
  it 's just easier when there are less disposable parts . 
  hey now , downton abbey is meant to be set in yorkshire !, 
  ( we still have entire villages owned by landlords and stuff :p it 's all very feudal . ), 
  yeah , i study in london . 
  it 's fun , but financially a right pita . 
  basically something needs to be done to stop the foreign investment in london housing , that 's what 's driving the prices up . 
  no , but if you replace mansion with house you 'd be describing my current surroundings pretty accurately :p . although this is yorkshire , not kent :p . yeah the london thing 's an issue . 
  its a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy - it gets more funding because its big , so it gets bigger , and so it gets more funding . 
  so then obviously the poster should say finland as well as suomi . 
  yeah , i got that haha . 
  i was saying that london does n't merely take up the southern half , but the whole country :p, 
  okay ... well , if finland is finland in swedish , and swedish is a commonly spoken language in finland , that would explain why they put both suomi and finland . 
  what ? 
  the kobold vt270 ? 
  it 's like $ 900 :p i noticed they gave the suction power though , giving the vacuum 28 % efficient . 
  i wonder if it 's normal for vacs to be that inefficient ... 
  what 's `` finland '' in swedish ? 
  i would fall into the `` ca n't be talked out of bagless '' category . 
  who wants to deal with bags and stuff ? 
  in any case , dyson vacs are really good . 
  they might not be the best , but they show that you can have a decent vac that does the job with fairly low power . 
  have you seen the led lenser torches ? 
  i was like http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt8aay_8ub4 when i saw it . 
  i 've got a few in my room , it 's great . 
  the whole power consumption of my room is like 12w now :p, 
  we still get halogen lights , which look similar to the old incandescents but are n't the same ... 
  where ... ca n't get them in the uk . 
  then again . 
  i do n't see the need for them . 
  leds all the way . 
  if dyson can make cleaners as good as it does using less then 1600w , so can everyone else . 
  your debt is a good 35 % gdp higher than ours :p, 
  yeah , in real life london would take up the * whole * island ... 
  ireland is a separate country ... 
  but they 're all bankrupt ...  _ , 
  they did it for ireland as well , presumably because it 's a common mother tongue ( probably more common than irish ... ) . 
  maybe the same reason ? 
  nor has the uk ... 
  i think sweden was being hipster in 1814 , and everyone else just took a while to catch on . 
  my own personal favourites in the uk , listed in the order i thought of them . 
  [ the yorkshire wolds ] ( http://www.yocc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/yorkshire-wolds-13.jpg ) not as fancy or well known as the moors and dales , but absolutely beautiful . 
  the epitome of `` green and pleasant land '' . 
  my parents live in a village in the wolds , and it 's so relaxing to come here from london . 
  [ stirling castle , scotland ] ( http://hqdesktop.net/wallpapers/l/1920x1080/77/cliffs_buildings_historic_hdr_photography_stirling_castle_1920x1080_76075.jpg ) really beautiful . 
  a great example of 16th century scottish architecture . 
  [ albertopolis , london ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/natural_history_museum_london_jan_2006.jpg ) the area of london containing the royal albert hall , the natural history museum , the science museum , the victoria & albert museum , imperial college london , the royal colleges of art and music , the royal geographic society and the royal institute of navigation . 
  such great concentration of knowledge , history and culture in such a small area would be difficult to find anywhere else in the world , i think . 
  my aim in life is to be able to afford a house within half an hour 's walk of here . 
  [ the british library , london ] ( http://magnacarta800th.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/aerial-view-of-bl.jpg ) the second largest library in the world , and one of the uk 's six legal deposit libraries . 
  it is home to the diamond sutra ( the earliest dated printed book from 868 ce ) . 
  aside from that , it 's one of the few truly quiet places in central london . 
  [ winchester , england ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/winchester_13.jpg ) the de facto capital of the anglo-saxon kingdom of wessex which expanded to encompass the whole on england in 927 ce , making \u00c6thelstan the first king of england . 
  it 's also a really nice town with the oldest public ( private ) school in england . 
  [ spurn point , england ] ( http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll198/haydut1200/spurn%20point/spurn.jpg ) an interesting feature at the end of the humber estuary , quite a nice place to go and visit , and see the ships coming in and out of the humber . 
  [ windsor castle , berkshire ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/windsor_castle_at_sunset_-_nov_2006.jpg ) the longest continually occupied castle/palace in europe , with the original construction dating from the norman conquest in the 11th century . 
  gibraltar is n't part of your country :p, 
  i saw one in edinburgh the other . 
  could n't help but laugh , it was hilarious seeing these two bulky scots stuffed into that tiny thing  _ , 
  they go to major incidents and stuff to provide food and drink to the police :p they saw `` action '' at the 7/7 bombings , and i 've seen them around at big festivals and things . 
  it 's a dove ...  _ , 
  not traditionally , no . 
  the blindfold is still pretty uncommon ; traditionally she 's supposed to be `` blind '' rather than blindfolded . 
  bbc news has a better quality version : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-28431943, 
  i think maybe he did that because it would be confusing to lots of viewers and it needed explaining ? 
  i think iceland is the only one in the `` illegal , clients prosecuted '' category . 
  i 'm not trying to argue a point . 
  i 'm confused .
