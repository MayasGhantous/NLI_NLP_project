  it 's completely opposite to how we like to do things . 
  civil law vs common law is a great example of this -- one is a codified system imposed from the top , the other is a naturally evolving framework that more quickly responds to new developments . 
  also think the methodology of the french empire vs the british empire . 
  i know people make jokes about the uk wanting to be an island off the american coast , but the truth of it is that the uk * is * different to the rest of europe in its attitude , and so its view are often fringe views in the eu . 
   ** and then ** people will just vote based on nonsense ** anyway ** ftfy, 
  all places have a spread , but you do n't see it because your centre is in a different place . 
  we do n't see as much of a spread in us politics because our centre is so far to the left that both the reps and the dems look the same . 
  it 's much the same here . 
  the long and short of it is that the uk is very different in its approach to governance than mainland europe ( think civil law vs common law for an example ) . 
  thus , even the opinions of mainstream uk parties are fringe views , but ones which most of the uk population agrees with -- this is true even if you ignore the independence thing . 
  the reason we do n't like the idea of `` more integration '' is because it means more top-down bureaucracy , which is actually quite antithetical to the political attitude in britain . 
  there 's a lot more bottom up stuff , with everyone doing what works for them , and very little `` harmonisation '' . 
  best part was that a large part of the yes campaign was that they 'd stay in the eu , but you replaced `` westminster '' with `` brussels '' in all of the snp 's arguments , they started to look a lot like ukip . 
  looks like a bit of dirt or a leaf or something ... 
  i did n't say that it was n't britain 's problem , but if you 're in schengen you ca n't logically be against a common schengen migrant policy . 
  we in britain can be against an eu one , or want to have a separate one , but if you 're in schengen you physically ca n't enforce a different policy . 
  you ca n't say its a german problem , not an french one , because if they get to germany they can just move to france anyway . 
  when did i say anything about closing schengen ? 
  well , at least the schengen area needs a common policy , since they have open borders . 
  you ca n't open your border and then say you do n't want to cooperate on migration issues . 
  right , but equally there 's no evidence to show the crime rate among non-eu immigrants is higher . 
  religious extremism is a problem , i 'll give you that ( especially with isis saying things like immigrate to their countries and screw them from the inside owtte ) . 
  anyway , opening our borders is n't going to solve anything . 
  the problem is that in order for them to claim asylum they must set foot on the land of the country , which is why they 're all drowning in the med trying to get to italy and greece . 
  the way to stop them trying to cross is to set up some sort of refugee centre on the turkish-syrian border , and get them to go there to claim asylum in the eu in general . 
  at that point we can decide whether we want to reject them or not . 
  i take your point . 
  my point is that in the uk many draw the line at working class and speaks with a foreign accent . 
  that is to say , as much as it hurts , they do n't like you any more than they like the poor pakistani immigrants or the poor african immigrants . 
  edit : ` you ' in the abstract ` poor eastern europeans ' sense . 
  not trying to imply anything about yourself . 
  yep . 
  you 're not going to get much deeper than bad spelling and grammar with the sun . 
  not to most british people they 're not . 
  everyone who was n't born here and is n't well-off is treated the same by most people . 
  you do n't get a special smiley just because you 're white and christian . 
  it 's a continuous spectrum , and where you draw the line for ` these people are compatible ' is completely arbitrary . 
  it 's just another punctuation mark , like , or . 
  except it 's ... . 
  because it 's three dots people do n't treat it as a single mark and feel at liberty to add and remove dots on a whim , even though they 're wrong . 
  it 's just coincidence that it 's lined up with the o to look like an umlaut . 
  this is no different from us bitching and moaning about the poor eastern europeans who come over here to take our jobs , and they ca n't even speak english , blah blah blah . 
  if you 're in schengen , you 've got open borders and it becomes your problem . 
  the schengen area needs a common immigration policy or else the while thing will fall apart . 
  she 's not a journalist , she 's a columnist . 
  yes , there is a difference . 
  hmc is the headmaster 's and headmistresses conference , which has as its membership ~ 250 heads of private schools ( around 10 % of all private schools in the uk ) . 
  membership is generally considered a sign of the educational quality of a private school ( hmc have got various guidelines about performance and exam results ) and is usually considered necessary ( although , depending on who you speak to , not sufficient ) for a private school to be ` public ' . 
  a boarding school is a school where the pupils live in the school , only going home at weekends or during school holidays . 
  all boarding schools are private ( afaik ) . 
  there are four in the area where i live : three good hmc ones ( one boarding ) and one with a bit of reputation for taking the thick rich kids . 
  the state schools here are n't so good , though , so a lot of professionals and businesspeople will send their kids to one of the private schools . 
  in other parts of england where the state schools are better i believe the private schools tend to be more for the kids who could n't get into a good selective state school . 
  but then you still have a ceremonial head of state who still costs a shitload to maintain ( because a ceremonial hos still has to live in a fashion that symbolises the wealth of the country ) , but who is now hated by ~ 50 % of the country and does n't have the same international relationships as a monarchy . 
  continuity in friendships is quite important , and when your hos changes every 5-10 years that 's lost a bit . 
  if they do n't care then they do n't care . 
  you ca n't have an opinion ( be a republican/monarchist ) * and * also not care . 
  that 's a bit oxymoronic . 
  well , they should do it uniformly . 
  if they 're only doing right to be forgotten in europe , they should only do dmca in the us . 
  well , how else are they going to do it ? 
  google ca n't tell other websites what to do . 
  french was the language used by the nobility when the last jester was appointed ( hence tom le fol ) , so presumably they 're carrying on the same way . 
  [ hehehehe ] ( http://revolution-computing.typepad.com/.a/6a010534b1db25970b01543227ebc3970c-800wi ) ... never let go !, 
  because germany has the nerve to ask for its loan to be repaid . 
   there are many brits who really do n't want the ultimate welfare queen . 
  but most do . 
  because the alternative would be a politician no-one likes . 
   there is far more benefit to the monarchical parasite than to the host is there ? 
  she 's well respected on the world stage , and royalty , whether you like it or not , adds clout to the uk 's diplomatic abilities * especially * in other countries with a monarchy . 
  there are many benefits other than the tourism thing . 
  it can easily be read as ` even if we leave the eu there should be unity in europe ' though . 
  as in , the eu is not necessary for unity . 
  there are many ways to look at the statement if you do n't assume the europe = eu . 
  but we are working together and standing as one -- externally , which is all that matters ultimately . 
  that does n't require us to use the euro . 
  * it 's not weird when the limited reports of their actions on the continent are specifically selected to paint them in an anti-eu light when most people in the uk know this is not true . 
  ftfy, 
  she 's not opposing government policy ... she never even mentioned the eu . 
   also the uk joining the euro would give it a huge boost . 
  and this is advantageous to the uk how ? 
  she did speak for a need for unity in europe . 
  they 're just denying that this suggests britain must stay in the eu . 
  eu = / = europe, 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen a british person wear clothes with the union jack on it ... everything else seems pretty accurate though :p, 
  tbf though i can imagine prince philip doing that for the banter . 
  well , it 's christian so that 's basically western as far as isis is concerned . 
  not quite . 
  no one official ever calls the uk `` england '' , but officials from the netherlands call it holland all the time . 
  their tourist board being the main one . 
  wait , so rural areas have * fewer * boars than urban areas ?!, 
  at least i got the rural = conservative thing . 
  some things do transcend national borders :p, 
  i suppose more boars = more rural = a more conservative electorate ? 
  we do make it a thing , but in a completely different way . 
  we spend most of the evening laughing at everyone , and we 've got graham norton picking holes the presenters ' outfits and making snarky comments about backing dancers and the eastern european voting bloc . 
  it 's great fun . 
  mostly we do n't take it seriously * at all * . 
  i genuinely think they set out to choose the most hilariously outlandish acts for us , just so we can watch them fail spectacularly . 
  bit annoyed we did n't get anything from the aussies though !,
