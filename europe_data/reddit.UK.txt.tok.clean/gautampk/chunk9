  http://www.eurovision.tv/page/vienna-2015/about/grand-final , it 's ordered by performance not result . 
  sweden was top , then russia and italy . 
  australia were like fifth i think . 
  ooh , are they saying why ? 
  beat france . 
  result . 
  thank you malta and san marino ( and ireland ) . 
  i believe they only get sent these for closely run votes in the parliament ( or whatever it is ) and for citizen petitions ... 
   i did , actually . 
  went to scotland and not just glasgow and edinburgh . 
  okay , well i do n't for one moment believe that all you saw was roads and barbed wire then . 
  it simply is n't true . 
   my point was that you should assume that you 're free to roam wherever somebody is n't making a home ( that is , you can clearly see that the lawn is moved ) . 
  that you need a map to find out if you can go somewhere seems rather limited . 
  you can roam wherever you want . 
  the maps are there to stop you wandering into restricted areas . 
  it is n't `` you * ca n't * go anywhere except these places '' it is `` you * can * go anywhere except these places '' . 
  okay , well , sorry that that was your experience . 
  you must not have gone very far from the towns and cities if all you could see was road . 
  did you ever leave the south east ? 
  the right to roam allows access to all farmland , moorland , mountains , downs , and heaths . 
  that 's basically everywhere . 
  i do n't know why you 're complaining about maps , you 'd get pretty lost without them ... 
  yes you can . 
  the uk has a right to roam : you can go pretty much wherever you want in the countryside provided it 's not a private garden . 
  there 's no barbed wire , except around farms to keep the animals in . 
  there 's always a gate you can use . 
  well , other than the three railway ones , none of these are enforced . 
  that was the whole bloody point of the post . 
  i do enjoy that placing a postage stamp upside down on an envelope is high treason , because it has a portrait of the queen on it . 
  other fun ones : * it is illegal to queue-jump or otherwise disrupt orderly queuing on the railways . 
  * it is illegal to stand or walk backwards on an escalator in a railway station . 
  * it is illegal not to wait for people alighting railway trains before boarding them . 
  * any beached whales are property of the crown . 
  * all mute swans in open water are property of the crown . 
  * you are not allowed to act drunk in a pub . 
  * it is illegal to die in the houses of parliament . 
  * it is illegal to withhold information from hmrc you want to be kept secret , but legal to withhold information you do n't mind them finding out . 
  loads of countries have stupid laws no one enforces any more . 
  but there was precedent set that newer freedom of speech laws are more important , so it 's less important . 
  okay , fair enough . 
  i can see that point of view . 
  i suppose we differ in that i would love for it to be developed in the uk . 
  nope , it 's pure conjecture . 
  but most people ( immigrants or not ) simply are n't well off enough to push house prices in london up as high as they are . 
  someone must be able to afford current prices , or the bubble will burst . 
  but building nuclear power plants is completely separate to research in nuclear power . 
  unless you 're opposed to nuclear regardless of any advancements in the field , that position makes no sense . 
  the london housing crisis is due to rich foreigners who do n't actually live in london buying up property . 
  it is not due to working immigrants . 
  in theory , yeah . 
  if we abolished party whips then people actually would vote for their local candidates ( not their party ) and it would actually be a reasonable system . 
  people like to vote according to where they hope to be in life , not where they are . 
  it 's one of the reasons inheritance tax is so unpopular , despite it overwhelmingly assisting the vast majority of people . 
   but comparing vote shares to seats , the discrepancy is unbelievable . 
  come on , it 's not * that * bad . 
  the smaller parties did get shafted ( lib dems , greens , and ukip in particular ) , but even with pr it would have been a conservative win . 
  they have have been forced to coalition with the lib dems or ukip , but it would have been much the same . 
  so as far as you 're concerned anything nuclear is universally bad ? 
  by that argument you 'd get rid of chemists as well , because they might discover a new gas to kill people with . 
  but do you not want scientific expertise to stay in the uk ? 
  people will go to where the funding is , especially if it 's just to france or germany where you do n't even need a visa . 
  but you ca n't just free ride on research by other countries . 
  the uk leads the way in nuclear fusion research in europe . 
  if you stop funding it , scientists will leave the country and go elsewhere in the eu : that 's not good for britain . 
  lab/snp takeover is what most feared i think . 
  it would be terrible for england . 
  the snp would be in a position to get every concession for scotland and dangle the threat of leaving over everyone 's head . 
  peers are now elevated by an independent commission , following the cash for peerages scandal . 
  it 's an * excellent * system . 
  the house of lords has lots of extremely valuable expert opinion to offer . 
  sometimes democratically elected representatives * do n't * make the best choices , and in those situations the hol can block the legislation and effectively ask * are you really sure ? 
  * if they want to , the commons can force through . 
  all of those things will still be things ... 
  honestly , reading people 's opinions of the tories here on reddit you 'd think they wanted to raze everything to the ground and return to feudal serfdom . 
  my problem with en262 is that they are going to stop funding for research into nuclear power . 
  it 's one thing to not build any new ones ( i do n't agree , but i can see the arguments ) , but to not even consider that future developments in the technology could result in safer plants with less waste is so short sighted . 
  it would also affect fusion research which has huge implications for science beyond just as a power source . 
  i would also point out that nuclear power is one of the safest sources out there , and i would quite happily live near one . 
  chernobyl went wrong because it was pushed beyond its limits - something that would never happen in the uk - and fukushima was an old outdated reactor that had long been marked as unsuitable for the conditions it was situated in . 
  on pa700/1 , i think that the fact that civil servants are n't allowed to campaign is an integral part of out system of government . 
  whoever is in government , they should be able to trust the civil servants to follow * their * policy , and professionally support * their * policy , not their own personal beliefs ( which they are entitled to have and express privately , of course ) . 
  just because we wo n't agree does n't mean we should n't talk . 
  my life would be incredibly boring if i ignored everyone who disagreed with me . 
  part of the reason i sub to political subreddits is to be able to debate with people outside my immediate friends circle ( who were mostly brought up like me , and believe in roughly the same things ) . 
  which ones do you particularly agree with ? 
  i am especially concerned with ar414 , cj381 , pd513 and , as a scientist , ar414 and en262 . 
  see my reply to / u/nieuweyork for a list of specific policies ... 
  [ the green party policies ] ( http://policy.greenparty.org.uk ) * ** ar402 ** population limitation . 
  * ** ar414 ** ban animal testing for new medicines and treatments . 
  * ** ar417 ** ban educational dissections . 
  * ** cj381 ** disproportionately give women lower sentences . 
  * ** cms206 ** unfettered freedom of speech * ** en261 ** no more nuclear power plants . 
  * ** en262 ** no more research into nuclear energy , with no distinction made between fission and fusion . 
  * ** pd205 ** no more nuclear weapons . 
  * ** pd308 ** publicly available military budgets . 
  * ** pd513 ** leave nato and end uk-us relations , leaving the uk utterly isolated whilst at the same time dismantling most of our military ( ** pd302 ** -- ** pd306 ** ) . 
  * ** pa460 ** abolish the house of lords , which is an important sanity check on the otherwise uninformed whims of the commons . 
  * ** pa700 ** & ** pa701 ** allow civil servants the right to campaign politically . 
  as a small summary .
