re-assemble are you trying to suggest they build them wherever , dis-assemble them , ship to europe , re-assemble for tax purposes ? 
  or was it simply a freudian slip ? 
  true , but it 's still an unusual term , seeing as cakes are most often associated with sweet foods , rather than savoury . 
  breadcake , is the term for a bread roll in sheffield , uk ( potentially the wider yorkshire area to ) , when i first moved there it had me amused for a while . 
   europe 's ** leading ** newspapers only english papers there are independent group papers ( independent , i , independent on sunday , independent.co.uk ) the independent and i combined have circulation of ~ 340k , there are [ 8 british newspapers with greater circulation than them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_newspapers_in_the_united_kingdom_by_circulation#circulations_2010_to_present ) . 
  so i 'd take their claims of leading , with a pinch of salt . 
  ------------------- similarly , the only french paper is lib\u00e9ration , [ which is ranked 6th by circulation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_newspapers_in_france ) among french newspapers . 
  ah , i may have misread the ` total ' above it as being for the decision section . 
   everyone 's talking about deporting rejected applicants i 've not come across this among british media , perhaps a symptom of our own countries policy of taking them directly from refugee camps , reducing the need for any form of mass deportation . 
   the numbers above are for accepted applicants . 
  ~ ~ they 're not , you can adjust the ` decision ' column to select rejected/approved . 
  so clearly alot of the male migrants are going missing somewhere , without attempting to register for citizenship . ~ ~ interestingly , at current ( the stats in your picture have since been updated ) [ that table ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=migr_asydcfstq&amp;lang=en ) shows 55k rejected 2015q2 , and only 46k with ` positive decisions ' . 
  also worth noting , those stats are from q2 ( april-june ) , which is before the migrant crisis reached its current state ( unhcr reports august had over 2x the number of migrants of june , and over 4x the number of april ) , so potentially skewed if the demographic of migrant has changed along with the increase in numbers . 
  the map on the uns page clearly depicts that it includes migrants/refugees coming through spain/italy/greece , 3 of the main entry points . 
  they also state that the data is based on arrivals , as provided by countries own ministries of interior/police . 
  given how no one is currently talking about deporting any of these refugees/migrants , it seems far more reasonable to use the data which encapsulates all of them , rather than the minority which have registered so far as that would assume that there are many migrant male 's simply disappearing . 
  it 's also worth considering that the un data says it is 72 % male adult , 15 % women adult , 13 % children . 
  by your own ratios which ignore children , this would make it closer to 5:1 , which shows that over half the male 's have gone missing somewhere along the way to your own registration ratios of 2:1 . 
  the [ uns own stats ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.html ) , currently put it at 72 % males , arriving over the mediterranean .

  ca n't speak for 8chan though . 
  a large part of the complaints of vote brigading may consist of users who do n't post , because they do n't want the hassle of being banned/harrassed for their opinions . 
  it 's always worth considering the [ 1 % rule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_\\ ( internet_culture \\ ) ) . 
  it 's several years away , so it 's hard to say really , alot can change in that time , especially seeing as it 's possible we will have exited the eu by then and the labour party may have fallen to bits under corbyn , making way for more lib dem/ukip seats . 
   [ propaganda is a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of a population toward some cause or position . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda ) regardless whether you consider the position good/bad ( because that would be subjective ) it 's propaganda if they are attempting to influence ( which in ` countering ' existing media , they clearly are ) . 
  that seems to be a pretty common thing with referendums . 
  if the government does n't get the answer it wants , they either ignore the result after time ( in the case of non-binding referenda ) or run it again with a slightly different question . 
  the british eu referendum shall be interesting if ` leave ' somehow wins . 
   [ plebiscites are a weapon of the state against the people in almost all cases . 
  if elites think they will lose them , they either do not hold them , or \\ ( if they are only weak and incompetent elites \\ ) they arrange to have them re-run to come up with the desired result . 
  ] ( http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2015/05/why-i-place-no-hope-in-a-referendum-on-britains-eu-membership.html )  [ it is quite funny to note that there is ( so far as i know ) no instance of a referendum which has had the ` right ' result ( i.e. 
  that desired by the elite ) being re-run . 
  there are many instances on the continent and in ireland of referenda which have had the ` wrong ' result ( i.e. 
  one unwelcome to the elite ) being re-run . 
  sometimes this is achieved by asking what is essentially the same question , but in a different guise , thus the eu constitution is re-badged as ` the lisbon treaty ' , amounting to more or less the same thing . 
  and it is then ratified in these countries which previously rejected it .

  your probably right then ( do n't speak much french myself ) , [ rts article ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/313386-france-roma-shooting-dead/ ) says roma , whilst quoting a tweet that says * gens du voyage * , mistranslations in a few places i guess .

  oh yes , i was just summarising from memory . 
  appears the term she used was ` democratically indefensible ' and they were going to try and lobby other parties to legislate for such a limitation . 
  [ i just recall the snp making a huge fuss about the uks eu referendum ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/29/nicola-sturgeon-scottish-veto-eu-referendum ) , saying that scotland does n't want to leave the eu , and even with a referendum , unless all constituent countries independently agree to leave it wo n't be legal or something . 
  there was a [ 2nd air show plane crash in the uk yesterday in the isle of wight ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-34026444 ) , but it landed in a field so no one died , so it did n't make as much news . 
  there was also another one that made quite a bit of news [ 3 weeks ago ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-33750405 ) at a festival in the uk when the pilot died . 
  i 'd also be wary of grouping scotland with england/wales , their political parties are regularly shown to be more pro-eu than the rest of the uk . 
  not sure how their population polls though . 
  but when the bbc is airing heavily pro-eu mockumentaries like ` the great european disaster movie ' , [ which has received funds from the eu to enable its distribution to other european countries ] ( http://www.ukipmeps.org/news_995_bbcs-pro-eu-mockumentary---ukip-asks-wheres-your-eu-logo.html ) , it 's hard to decide what 's [ propaganda and what is n't ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11445299/the-great-european-disaster-movie-10-things-it-got-wrong.html ) . 
  there was also suggestion from some mps that [ the bbc has a pro-eu bias ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-31837551 ) regarding the upcoming referendum . 
  there was also fuss about the bbc and the eu/immigration a couple of years ago to . 
   [ the bbc has a `` deep liberal bias '' and has failed to reflect the public 's growing concerns about immigration and the european union , helen boaden , the bbc 's former director of news admitted in july 2013 . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/10158679/bbc-has-deep-liberal-bias-executive-admits.html ) in part this bias has often been attributed to the [ money that the bbc receives off the eu ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9055183/bbc-admits-receiving-millions-in-grants-from-eu-and-councils.html ) . 
  but in large i expect it can primarily be attributed to the employee demographics of the bbc all adding their own minor bias 's . 
  december 2014 btw , this was quite a while ago . 
  i would assume the tools are fully automated , the ones on stack overflow are , sometimes you can spot them by seeing stack overflow users lose 1k + karma , due to user deletions . 
  derp , was mistaken between finland and denmark ( just checked a map ) . 
   forty-year-old malik is one of those in the camp who has previously been deported from england . 
  for 14 years , he lived in west london , between shepherd 's bush and white city , near the bbc 's old headquarters , working at a grocery store . 
  so he broke the immigration rules , and was kicked out . 
  instead of applying the correct and legal way , he tries to break the rules again . 
   every one of the men i speak to tells me he has fled either war or dictatorship . 
  i have a friend who is from iraq at university , himself and his family are not muslims , yet his family are still living in iraq despite the threat of isis . 
  there are millions of people ( potentially a billion or more if we consider all the issues affecting africa ) who are subject to conditions of war , dictators , famine etc. 
  it is not possible to help all of these people or even support them with our own welfare systems . 
  so why should we help the undocumented queue jumpers , who may have destroyed their identity paperwork and as such could be lying about their reason for assylum , over the ones following the legal and documented procedures to apply for asylum ? 
  yeah , it 's really annoying and problematic . 
  as someone sympathetic to euro-sceptic views and similar ` right-wing ' stances that can be aggressively downvoted in this sub , even if perfectly reasonable and civil . 
  i started posting here after this change in moderation , after previously avoiding due to the censorship . 
  this was [ first responded ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hcbld/changes_in_reurope_moderation/cu67w23 ) to by people insinuating i 'm a racist as i infrequently posted to / r/european . 
  it 's a shame really that there are people so intolerant and hostile to opposing views in this sub . 
  already , my comment karma is negative , despite me remaining perfectly civil . 
  the main problem seems to be from [ someone posting ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hcy25/owen_jones_talks_to_calais_migrants_they_forget/cu6u1m3 ) incessant personal attacks , against the author of a quote i provided to refute their point , derailing the thread away from the actual topic . 
  i discussed this with the mod \\ / u\\/ivashkin , however they stated that rule 1.2 ( forbidding personal attacks that are offtopic ) only applies to personal attacks against users ( hence the rule might be worth clarifying in the wiki ) , so i 'm stuck with a rate limit of posting to this sub , due to me asking a user to cease use of the ad hominem fallacy . 
   being an immigrant does n't automatically equate what you just said . 
  these calais migrants being discussed in the owen jones article have queue jumped , they are not following the legal procedures ( e.g. 
  actually applying for asylum or immigration like everyone else outside the eu , or even staying in the first safe country they can claim asylum per the un doctrine ) . 
  those of them who are cutting fences and entering lorries attempting to reach the uk , are damaging property ( many lorries stock has been destroyed due to potential for contamination ) . 
  i 'm a post-grad student in the north , surrounded by vocal hard-left views , so most people i witness are sympathetic to the green party etc. 
  the [ raw data ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/537apwugsy/internalresults_150805_left_right_policies_w.pdf ) shows the breakdown by political party , age , region , income etc ( incase your unaware , yougov is legit , their polls attempt to survey a cross-sectional demographic of the uk population ) . 
  it appears the feeling is pretty well distributed . 
  #support by party total | con | lab | lib | ukip -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 54 | 66 | 42 | 29 | 88 #support by region total | london | rest of south | midlands/wales | north | scotland | england/wales ( overlaps with prior columns ) -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 54 | 50 | 53 | 59 | 59 | 43 | 56 #support by age total | 18-24 | 25-39 | 40-59 | 60 + -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 54 | 25 | 47 | 60 | 66, 
  as i said before ;  also worth noting that 54 % is way higher than ukips 27.5 % in the last eu election or ~ 9 % in the last general election , so there must be alot of other people in lab/con with these views to . 
  so painting ukip with that brush , whilst there are even more non-ukip supporters holding the view is unproductive . 
  personally i 'm sympathetic to many ukip policies and voted for them at the recent general election ( was in a labour stronghold , so my vote was worthless regardless , yay fptp ) , yet i 'm fully aware that any kind of complete ban on immigration would be ridiculous . 
  stereotypes are bad , it 's much better to stick the the facts rather than helping perpetuate the myth that ukip is the new bnp . 
  if people are unfamiliar with british politics , it 's possible they could mistake the satire you linked as reflective of ukip policy . 
  your still yet to explain why helping people who intentionally queue jump , damage property and often destroy identification documents over those following the legal procedures , is the christian thing to do , which was the refutation of your initial point . 
  not sure what part of that is ; ' a hack ' , ` far-right agenda ' , 'em barrassing ' or any other slur you have called it in avoidance of the topic at hand . 
  [ ukip are pro controlled immigration ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11447132/nigel-farage-ukips-immigration-policy-is-built-on-fairness.html ) , they 're simply the only party opposed to free movement of people and hence attract all those who are vehemently anti-immigration due to them having the strongest stance on immigration along with more tolerant supporters ( as with anything , the vocal minority are most often at the extreme ends of the spectrum ) . 
  i saw [ this ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/08/06/support-radical-left-and-right/ ) poll the other day , and was shocked to see that 54 % surveyed would support a 2 year total ban on immigration , it 's absurd . 
  also worth noting that 54 % is way higher than ukips 27.5 % in the last eu election or ~ 9 % in the last general election , so there must be alot of other people in lab/con with these views to . 
  if people are using alts to brigade , is n't that the kind of thing reddit has automatic systems for detecting and banning ? 
  stack overflow certainly does . 
  given that / r/europe is a default , it 's certainly possible that there is a silent majority who vote with limited other interaction . 
   the guy you quoted has only a tenuous grasp on reality feel free to critique the argument i quoted in my [ above post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hcy25/owen_jones_talks_to_calais_migrants_they_forget/cu6vcny ) , i 'm unclear of what parts of it are n't true to reality . 
  your avoidance of doing so , is petty at best . 
  would it be better for me next time to quote him without citation so you do n't get distracted by the original authors unrelated opinions ? 
  christopher hitchens is dead ( and as such would not be commenting on current events , they are however brothers ) , in / r/ukpolitics it 's generally understood that hitchens refers to the peter hitchens who is a conservative political commentator , however i 'll try to do so in future , for the clarity of those less into british politics .
