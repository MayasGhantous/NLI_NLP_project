  anyway you 've already shown your bias by framing brexit as a right or wrong choice . 
  so you should . 
  otherwise you would live in a desert . 
  ` people do n't like being freed . ' - david starkey . 
  that goes someway to explain your bitterness . 
  it seems you should have more of an issue with the germans and russians than the uk . 
  what on earth do they teach in the schools over there ? 
  unless youre scotland . 
  generalisation much ? 
  you 've been reading too much fake news , the uk is a very hospitable country . 
   hence the views of the natural-ness of the eu it may be this case that this would be a generational change in viewpoint , and not an age-related change as generations are mainly defined by age i do n't agree . 
  real life happened . 
  young vs old is just a synonym for left wing vs right wing . 
  also in absolute numbers the young people preferred to remain at home rather than vote for remain . 
  it 's no different to how people on here have treated the uk after brexit . 
  yep . 
  the british invented what is now ` rsa ' but did n't market it . 
  / u/cloudsofgrey is correct . 
  german cars do not fare well in reliability tables .

  linux started with linus torvalds but i would n't be surprised if the majority of the code in the source is now from the usa . 
  the bulgarian troll has woken up . 
  no , we can only sign it the day after we have left . 
  we can `` informally '' negotiate it now . 
  the problem of a country that rarely gets snow and whether it 's worth heavily investing in snow preparation or just accepting we 'll struggle through it when it arrives . 
  there are plenty of snowflakes on here mate . 
  coincidentally we had plenty of snow up in scotland on new years day , but that was also up the torridon mountains . 
  it 's the 5 minutes of hate and he 's goldstein . 
  yes but then you went on to assume that what the roi wants the eu will also want . 
  it 's not up to the republic of ireland , it 's up to the eu . 
  jeez . 
  you do realise that the uk government is one of those irish sides right ? 
  republic of ireland \u2260 eu, 
  because the only rational decision was to vote in hilary with her skeletons ? 
  the uk government do n't want a border . 
  the only entity that will force one is the eu . 
  like liechtenstein ? 
  there 's already a precedent . 
  how is the airport doing ? 
  i flew out of there with ryanair back to london once , it had 2 flights per day , the other went to frankfurt . 
  i remember it being the same size as my local sainsburys . 
  it 's brexit 's fault . 
  i thought it was part of romania . 
  a clearly superior country . 
  way to form an opinion . 
  i saw one bulgarian hold a sign saying `` i hope all brits die because of brexit '' now i think all bulgarians want me to die . 
  jeez . 
  comments by unchecked arrogant remainers always give me a laugh . 
  it seems we are still in denial here and sticking with all brexiteers are idiots then ? 
  nice . 
  get off reddit and go outside . 
  you might find yourself surprised . 
  because it benefits germany and they basically run the ecb, 
  please go and understand the word average . 
  the gbp eur is currently 1.17 . 
  it was less in 2009 , 2010 , 2011 and was the same in 2013 . https://www.ofx.com/en-us/forex-news/historical-exchange-rates/ sounds like that count from sesame street could do you some good ? 
  monte paschi mean anything to you ? 
  the pound is above the average eur exchange rate for the previous 4/10 years . 
  it 's distinctly average . 
  italian banking debt on the other hand ... 
  your logic is baffling , yet as usual the end result is a critique of the british . 
  reductio ad absurdum , the french were guilty of genocide of native falklanders when selling exocet missiles to the fascist argentina government . 
  thanks for your courage in this sub , even when under heavy fire . 
  coming from an italian this is a bit rich . 
  terraces like these can be very expensive indeed . 
  it 's all about location . 
  they 're not the typical poor person house . 
  abbreviated as cunt . 
  it 's what china does . 
  the western states just start work later . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7771976/2-13122016-bp-en.pdf/2e741df1-4247-4511-8b2b-51631f257f83 the big jump from sweden at 111 % to italy at 99 % is a clear example of the two different europes . 
  there is also a japanese one qzss but it only works between japan and australia . 
  wrong , you forgot luxembourg . 
  talk about generalisations . 
  52 % voted to leave the eu . 
  it 's you who are making tedious conclusions . 
  that migration from uk to south africa feels too high . 
  i thought it was going to spain before i followed it . 
  yeah but we have to understand all of your accents . 
  try getting an indian , scotsman , brummie , south african and a chinese person on the phone all speaking english and understand them . 
  the uk is going through this exact transfer now . 
  bt openreach ( who own the infrastructure ) is a private organisation under regulation but it is too closely connected with bt . 
  this has upset the other private telecom companies claiming unfair competitive practices . 
  it is about to be extracted from bt and made into an independent company outside the influence of bt . 
  mm , like greece/italy and the design of the euro . 
  well september the 11th was n't exactly him starting the war . 
  unless you 're one of those conspiracy types . 
  anders breivik made a comment alluding to this in his thesis . 
  i 'm going to guess so it can be hung up somewhere whilst you clean the room . 
  it 's in germany so efficiency will be the goal . 
  aye in newcastle . 
  this also happens to be where all the cheaper long distance coach journeys from eastern europe terminate . 
  is this really surprising ? 
  so why is one method assumed impossible but the other not ? 
  there are many countries in the eu with their own currency . 
  it 's difficult but definitely not impossible . 
  it was $ 1.40 for a short period of 2015 , barely a few months . 
  before that , you 'll have to go back 9 years to 2007 to see the gbpeur reach such high levels . 
  if the regions of italy are unwilling to give up power to their national government , it makes you wonder what their feeling is on the eu . 
  gbpeur is also hitting $ 1.20 .
