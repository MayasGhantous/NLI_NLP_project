  edit : i realise that was a wall o jumbledf text , sorry , it 's a saturday morning . 
  ultimately , they 're going to have to pay more money for them . 
  whether that be offering refunds for their education and living expenses incurred throughout their training or offering higher wages , there 's not much they can do within the context of eu free movement legislation . 
  the money need not be on the scale of that paid in the west but it does need to guarantee a similar , or nearly similar , quality of life . 
  i imagine access to modern healthcare infrastructure might also be a factor , but i do n't know what their hospitals are like . 
  we do n't need to try and guess , our mps are ranked for us on this handy site . 
  at the bottom there is a list with the best looking at the top . 
  women : http://sexymp.co.uk/index.php?gender=f men : http://sexymp.co.uk/index.php?gender=m the conservatives are miles ahead , it would seem . 
  denmark has an opt out on the euro , de jure , and sweden has an opt out , de facto . 
  well everyone , de facto has an opt out because it would be politically untenable to force a country in the euro ( forcing a commitment to join is different . ), 
  why do they keep them ? 
  well , they do n't ` keep ' them for one , it 's not like they could throw the uk out . 
  it 's also good business sense . 
  the uk is one of the biggest net contributors and has a trade deficit with the rest of the eu . 
  why would they get rid of a major cash cow and harm their economies ? 
  also , i 'm terms of politics , the uk is rarely the lone voice of opposition . 
  it may be the loudest but it almost always has allies . 
  and finally , not being a part of the euro or schengen essentially means the uk has no influence of those aspects of the eu . 
  it also basically prevents a brit taking the top positions in the eu since they tend to pick some from a member state within schengen and the eurozone . 
  it 's really a question that will elicit different thought processes from different people . 
  would it be wrong to say that an oil rich , north western european , high productivity economy of around 5 million people with a moderately strong secondary education system and an outsized higher education system was like , well , another oil right north western european , high productivity economy of around 5 million people with a moderately strong secondary education system and an outsized higher education system ? 
  both with a left-wing political narrative and a history of being dominated by a larger neighbouring country ? 
  no , clearly those are both quite accurate descriptions . 
  realistically , there are aspects in which norway and scotland are the two most similar countries in europe and there are aspects where saying they 're similar could n't be farther from the truth . 
  it 's essentially a meaningless question because it means so much to so many people . 
  culture ? 
  economy ? 
  politics ? 
  modern history ? 
  world view ? 
  geographic location ? 
  who knows what people are going to think . 
  also , comparing glasgow to oslo ? 
  surely edinburgh to oslo is the more fair comparison . 
  but that raises the question as to why we ca n't compare glasgow to oslo ? 
  why does the largest city in a country which is economically and geographically so similar to norway perform so poorly in comparison ? 
  makes you wonder , does n't it . 
  well , it makes me wonder anyway . 
  except , expats are affected by legislation in their former home states . 
  pensions , benefits for the elderly , access right to the health service , investment in as much as it makes pensions sustainable , immigration laws , inheritance legislation , membership of international organisations , and so on . 
  arguably they 're more important to expats than almost any law that could be based within the eu outside of the home state . 
  your argument might make sense within a federal europe but , alas for some , we are not part of the use . 
  the most beautiful areas of scotland tend to be in the highlands and islands ( which is n't to say that the central belt and lowlands are devoid of beauty , they 're still damn pretty . ), 
  for example , the isle of sky is gorgeous .

  from what i gather , one should n't compare growth rates from one quarter to the next i.e. 
  quarter 2 should n't be compared with quarter 4 . 
  what i think this article is saying , though the wording is terribly unclear , is that the final quarter saw growth of 0.4 % which , when compounded with the growth in the three preceding quarters , meant that the total growth for the year was 0.9 % . 
  so , if at the start of the year the economy was equal to 100 . 
  at the end of the year it was equal to 100.9 , and at the beginning of the final quarter it was equal to 100.49 . 
  ( if my interpretation of their writing is correct that is . ), 
  edit : according to trading economics my interpretation was correct . 
  the first quarter saw zero growth , the second 0.2 % , third 0.3 % , and the final ( as the article says ) saw 0.4 % . 
  compounding that all together gives a total of 0.9 % growth over the year and around 0.5 % over the first three quarters ( as calculated above ) . 
  where 's the evidence that just because it 's gmo it 's low quality ? 
  also , why do n't they just label it as gmo free and run an ad campaign on that basis ? 
  free trade commands a premium in that basis . 
  organic does so too . 
  why could n't a free from gmo labelling industry develop and why do the gmo producers have to bear the cost of undermining themselves ? 
  far from removing an unfair advantage for the gmo producers it lends the non-gmo producers one . 
  how does the beer law affect you getting a beer that tastes exactly as you want . 
  remember a few brands you like and , if you feel like you want a particular taste , buy one of those . 
  why 's that ? 
  no , it 's right . 
  i think it literally means tongue but could be wrong . 
  and only the parent company 's nationality ? 
  otherwise , jaguar land rover ( it 's just one company btw ) is headquartered in the uk and bentley is too . 
  it 's meaningless anyway . 
  the ownership is meaningless i 'm determining the ` nationality ' of the company . 
  take bmw , it 's clearly german . 
  yet 11 % is owned by british , and 18 % by americans . 
  three germans own just under 50 % and the ret of germany owns around 4 % . 
  would it be off the wall to claim that bmw is one third anglo-saxon ? 
  yes , it is . 
  the company is headquartered in germany , lead by germans and , i think , does most of its manufacturing in germany . 
  that 's generally what people mean when they refer to a company as having a nationality . 
  not that indians are the current owners after having bought a company from the americans who had had bought companies from the germans and british which had previously been owned by the british government and various other institutional investors and individuals throughout their history after having been founded in britain . 
  some of the eu countries who have n't recognised kosovo do it for poliotical reasons . 
  the most important of them is spain who does it as it does n't want to set the precedent of supporting unilateral declations of independence . 
  regardless , it does n't matter if it 's childish ( politics almost invariably descends to the level of the playground anyway ) . 
  all it will take is one country to veto serbian accession ; there are some countries for whom kosovo is a sensitive issue and who would be inclined to veto until the matter was resolved in a politically accetable way . 
  once it 's adjusted for purchasing power the map changes somewhat , at least on some of the items you 've listed as notable . 
  the v4 are much more tightly packed together with hungary being more like 90 % of poland , rather than 70 % . 
  the uk has a household income which is around 10 % higher than ireland 's , which compares to it being around 85 % of the irish income level shown on the map . 
  the other two baltic states are n't in the oecd so they ca n't be compared . 
  the same is true for the ex-yugoslavian counties , with only slovenia being a member . 
  the microstates are not members either . 
  firstly , i 'm neither saying the netherlands is the best nor that it is not , all i 'm saying is a second hand biased anecdote does not constitute a reliable source . 
  secondly , defra ( part of the uk government ) commissioned a study into the effectiveness of the different countries of the eu in terms of their compliance with the drinking water directive . 
  their conclusion was it was difficult to tell due to the lack of reports from each nation . 
  what eh did add was that , of the countries in the study , the netherlands was both most similar to the british system and seemed to be the most effective ( note , only of the six studied ( fr , de , dn , it , es , nl ) ) . 
  i 'm from scotland where it rains every week too , and it 's miserable between october and october also .
