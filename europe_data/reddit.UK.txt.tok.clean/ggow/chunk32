  just because you do n't think their cause its worthwhile , it does n't mean it should be banned . 
  efficacy is n't really the point . 
  from a political perspective , it 'll be hard to justify the uk funding the iplayer service through a licence fee just for it to be widely available to everyone else in the eu . 
  it 'll cause serious resentment . 
  probably the fairest thing in that regard is a an exemption for state-run services ( mostly ) funded by licences/general taxation . 
  it might not actually achieve anything but it 's just good politics . 
  what makes you think that they 'll be allowed to charge different prices in different areas ? 
  it might not maximise their profits , but creating a common market is the end goal of the eu , not maximising profits . 
  i reckon what they 'll do is just offer tiered services within the eu market . 
  there actually is plenty of evidence to show that the structure of the eur , and the surpluses ran by the core , and the competitive advantage the north gets by having an undervalued currency , are major factors in the southern countries being so badly hit by the crisis . 
  they 're actually discussed over and over on here ( usually receives on / r/europe with fingers in ears and a chorus of la la la ) . 
  but what if it is ? 
  no , it 's not colloquial . 
  mongoloid was the term used by down initially , and that was phased out through the 60s and 70s . 
  it was used as down thought there were similarities between the appearance of mongoloids and those with ds . 
  the name basically comes from 19th century conceptions of race and somewhat implies that the vast majority of people in asia look as though they have down syndrome . 
  in short , no . 
  it 's definitely racist . 
  even if it was n't , it 'd still be making fun of tsipras as the expense of a group of people who drew some of the shortest straws in society . 
  actually , it does n't ` just ' mean that in the slightest . 
  there 's a lot of 19th century racism behind the use of the word mongoloid to refer to those with down syndrome and very good reasons for its phase out over half a century ago . 
  mongoloid was mooted as one of the three major races , alongside caucasoid and negroid , so to insult someone by saying they have a mongoloid-type face is a straight-up racial slur . 
  ( albeit in your case , that 's through ignorance of the words you were using ) . 
   if i was from scotland i 'd get it for free if you lived ( i.e. 
  were ordinarily resident ) in scotland , you 'd get it for free . 
  so long as you 're an eu national , it has little else to do with where you 're from . 
  if you took a gap year and moved to scotland to work before university , you 'd have got it for free . 
  in an ideal world , you would n't have to pay . 
  can you imagine the crowding-out effect of free refugees though , if there was equality ? 
  it would quickly not be worth the investment for the scottish government , as most people would come for free tuition then leave right after . 
  this is n't necessarily a new thing . 
  up in dundee , the local authority employs ( ed ? ), 
  street ambassadors that were , ostensibly , to give tourism advice and help people out around the city centre . 
  in the end , they were actually being directed to move beggars on , under threat of filing false claims of ` aggressive begging ( a criminal offence cf. 
  begging ) ' . 
  one local guy impersonated a beggar and got it all on camera ; pretty shocking behaviour . 
  yeah , that did happen . 
  despite that , the spread of more subtle ` defensive ' architecture continues . 
  there is a reason so many benches have individual seats now , as opposed to being actual benches . 
  primarily , that 's to prevent homeless people sleeping on them . 
  that said , it 's not a uk-only trend so sarcastic ` britishvalues ' comments are uncalled for . 
  different methodologies give different results . 
  the uk-wide rankings almost universally rank st andrews as the best in scotland , followed by edinburgh , and then glasgow . 
  regardless , the four ancients ( less so with aberdeen now ) all have really good reputations throughout the uk . 
  ** the times ** : st andrews ( 3 ) , edinburgh ( 22 ) , glasgow ( 26 ) , aberdeen ( 44 ) , dundee ( 45 ) ** the guardian ** : st andrews ( 3 ) , edinburgh ( 20 ) , glasgow ( 24 ) , dundee ( 38 ) , aberdeen ( 41 ) ** complete university guide ** : st andrews ( 5 ) , edinburgh ( 20 ) , glasgow ( 30 ) , aberdeen ( 40 ) , dundee ( 42 ) incidentally , one of the primary reasons that st andrews ranks so low in the world rankings you cite , but dominates the others in the uk based ones , is to do with how it is categorised . 
  it does n't really do any engineering . 
  it has half a medical school , following on from that being transferred to dundee when that was founded . 
  it does n't do law . 
  it 's a small university that focuses on quite specific things . 
  glasgow and edinburgh , on the other hand , are more * complete * universities , which really has no bearing on the quality of the education . 
  scots is a germanic language , very closely related to english . 
  gaelic is celtic . 
  gaelic was mostly spoken in the highlands and islands , as well as some other areas in the rural south west coast . 
  outwith those areas , scots was the dominant language until roughly the union of the crowns , thereafter english started to creep down through the classes and institutions . 
  scots is the language that would have been spoken where they are from and the language that is influencing their english . 
  some scots words are thrown in . 
  tl ; dr no , scots not gaelic . 
  when they were n't speaking over one another , and context was n't being taken out by the bleeps , it 's fairly easy to pick up . 
  it 's not a particularly obscure dialect ( sub-dialect ? ), 
  of scottish english that they 're speaking in . 
  in fact , they sound like they 're from near glasgow to me , which means that this would be the dialect of scottish english that most people in scotland would have bee exposed to ( most populous area , dominates the scottish media landscape etc. ) . 
  doric , on the other hand , that 's something that even other scots would struggle to understand without help . 
   but are they speaking english yeah , they are . 
  it 's a informal register of the scottish english dialect of english , which is heavily influenced by the scots language . 
  to translate it from scottish english to the english that most non-native speakers would learn :  guy - when i slept with someone else , i told her that night  woman - yeah but it 's there ; it 's there . 
  did i do it to [ drowned out ] , did i ? 
  you did !, 
  now you 're going to say , when you finally get the balls to admit it , one or two girls . 
  it 's clear , no it 's clear ... no i 'll fucking keep it . 
  guess what your daughter will see when she 's [ bleep ] . honestly . 
  and do you know what ? 
  what 's the point ? 
  and you 're going to hit me with all of it over the next few days - when you 're not on the tv , and when you 're away ~ ~ bubbling and greeting ~ ~ crying like a baby , you 're going to come bubbling and greeting , on your knees , and go on about it having only been one , only one . 
  what did i say ? 
   guy - i do n't even want to talk to you . 
  i do n't even want to talk to you . 
   woman - you 're a scumbag . 
  honestly . 
   guy - i do n't even want to talk to you . 
  in chip shops you 'll usually find things like deep fried and battered haggis , black budding , sausages , and things along those lines . 
  the kebab shops will have things like haggis pakora , and pizzas , but other than that , you 'll find the same things as you 'll get elsewhere in the uk ; lots of indians , chinese , thai , and restaurants along those lines . 
  i do n't think they differ all that much , though i may be wrong . 
  snootiness is annoying and a lot of hipsters are snooty . 
  also , the aforementioned ` transformation ' is called gentrification and it often comes at the the expense of displacing the local populace . 
  my view point is that cities grow , develop and change , but being priced out of your home is definitely ` annoying ' . 
  as i said , i do n't mind the ` flat white ' economy , anything spreading good coffee is good with me , but it 's not without its social costs . 
   are convicted terrorists and murderers treated the exact same as people who commit parking violations in germany ? 
  in as much as they can both be sure that their human rights are protected , yes they are . 
  it 's the other way around . 
  doctors are one of the best paid professions in the uk , and will typically earn significantly more than the median/mean salary . 
  it could be that there 's been a bad translation of the initial quote into swedish , and she meant something like middle-class salary , which would make more sense ; buying nice homes in london is something that is becoming unaffordable to people on doctor-level salaries . 
  the world is nowhere near that simple . 
  germany pursued policies that depressed domestic demand and wages for basically all of the first decade of this millennium . 
  it is benefiting from a currency undervalued for their economy . 
  running large surpluses can have a damaging effect on global and ez economic stability . 
  in the context of all of that , plus their commitments not to run overly large surpluses , they have a responsibility to take steps to reduce those surpluses . 
  running large surpluses with systems like the ez is how you go about breaking them . 
  if you think germany is being singled out , you 've not been paying attention . 
  ( it 's also not especially appropriate to the use the word ` retarded ' in such a way . ), 
  it 's not about depressing your economy .
