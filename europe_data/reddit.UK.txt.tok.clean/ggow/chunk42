  and go have a think about how evel , as proposed , would work . 
  how could it not neuter the cabinet system . 
  a laughable assertion , considering how two of the most widely supported parties pander to english nationalism . 
  not to my knowledge , no . 
  i think she can prorogue the parliament but the calling of an early election was removed from her ( and thus the pm 's ) power with the ftpa2011 . 
  how do you imagine that coming about ? 
  labour ca n't afford another election and you think they 'll be tarnished from possibly working with the snp , and the snp wo n't want to risk the privileged position they 've got in to . 
  how do you get over the 2/3rd vote required to call an early election ? 
  how many turkeys are going to vote for christmas ? 
  if all of the parties have scottish in their name - and for the big three they are basically the same party as the uk-wide ones ( e.g. 
  scottish labour is an ` accounting unit ' of the labour party for example ) - then how does that explain the snp getting the vote ? 
  surely they all should be getting the vote ? 
   i 'm tired of the constant pandering to scotland in the news and in politics how terrible that another part of the country is the focus of attention for a period of time .

  oh , was that not the pandering you were talking about it ? 
  tell me , what is it then because i 'm not seeing it . 
  the parties are promising the status quo , budget wise , and relatively minor devolution compared to the ` vow ' . 
  if that 's pandering , then i wonder what ignoring would be . 
   than approval of the snp i dunno , they have pretty stellar approval ratings at the moment . 
  disillusionment with labour and libdem are certainly the key reason but the snp had to prove they could be trusted with the vote first . 
  if the snp had n't been ( seen to be ) so good in government , many would have held their noses and voted as normal . 
   a scottish national party in an independent scotland would be a little superfluous . 
  probably . 
  they 're a somewhat broad church , bound together by pushing for independence . 
  without that , they 'd probably disintegrate after a parliament or two ( or a schism would take place with the leftists most likely to retain the brand ) . 
   win a fucking landslide in the next election it really depends on how the government functions . 
  i think most of the fears about the snp having influence are being overblown by the media/conservatives e.g. 
  the snp were much better received when they were unfiltered in the debates . 
  i 'd agree that it 's the most likely outcome but i 'd say there 's still the chance for it to be turned around . 
  five years is a long time . 
   he wants to tackle the class segregation of the uk and wants to improve social mobility for equal chances and opportunities for all british you 'll not find anyone in the uk who says anything different . 
  the difference is largely in how they propose to go about eliminating the differences and the price they 're willing to pay . 
  the conservatives think that it does n't matter if inequality goes up , so much as everyone is somewhat richer . 
  labour think ( milliband 's labour anyway ) economic inequality stiffles growth and class mobility so less economic growth is a price worth paying for closing the equality gap , and so on . 
  the education policy they put forward is informative . 
  they all view education as key for combating social inequality . 
  conservatives want to copy friskolor from the swedes . 
  the libdems favour the pupil premium . 
  ukip want grammar schools back . 
  labour are picking a heavy line in vocational education so that everyone gets a suitable education . 
  as far as universities goes , the conservatives favour the marketisation of the system , ostensibly for the extra money to be directed to fund increased social participation . 
  labour want to cut the level of tuition charged , to make it more affordable . 
  the libdems want ( ed ) it free , failing that a legal obligation for universities to seek out the best from disadvantages backgrounds . 
  ukip want to fund stem courses , and charge for the rest . 
  those are the broad strokes , but it may be a little inaccurate as the education policy being discussed in this election does not affect scotland ( with it being a totally devolved matter ) . 
  it illustrates the differences in ideology , i think , while showing that social mobility is what they all say they want to achieve . 
  irish migrants to major industrial centres during the 19th century , for the most part . 
  if you look at scotland 's central belt , for example , you see glasgow and , further west , inverclyde have high numbers of catholics . 
  both areas were major ship building , and other , industrial areas that attracted a lot of migrants . 
  the recent surge in poles is not likely to have the sane effect as , i think , they 're much more evenly spread and also less numerous . 
   we need people to buy our shit . 
  that 's what everyone else is thinking they need to happen too . 
  it 's unlikely to happen so your politicians need to start looking at something else if that 's all they 've got . 
  first , though , there are a couple of countries who you might want to consider talking to , who do have the capacity to provide the eu-wide demand ** cough ** germany ** cough ** . 
  their consistently huge trade surpluses are one of the major sources of instability in the ez and it 's pretty farcical that they 're allowed to continue flaunting the rules on it . 
   i think it has much more to do with the economics of the situation , clumping in ` southern europe ' with ` northern europe ' into a single economic block is fine when little tweaking is needed , but now that action is needed , it 's impossible to act in a way that benefits everybody in the euro at the same time . 
  the individual states have quite disparate economies and needs too . 
  the policy tools do exist to make sure the eurocrisis does n't exist , they 're just not in place e.g. 
  a federal debt means that one state ca n't be picked on by the markets , federal benefits means that poorly performing states are automatically helped by those who are performing well ( or the federal debt is increased , and that 's not likely to lose market access ) . 
   there is less of a democratic mandate for the dollar than the euro . 
  that 's a pretty fanciful notion . 
  have there been referenda on joining or leaving the dollar , no ? 
  is that the only measure of a democratic mandate ? 
  absolutely not . 
  the near total absence of opposition to the states-wide currency , the fact that it is n't even on the radar , would indicate that there is a huge and widespread acceptance of its existence . 
  the same can not even remotely be closely said about the euro . 
   new york , does n't just transfer money to california though , so it 's not a fair comparison poor comparitor states but , actually , some states do ` subsidise ' other states . 
  ( subsidise is the wrong word , since it 's more the price of having a stable currency union than a subsidy to mississippi ) . 
  the federal government collects taxes from all states , it then spends it on benefits , and the military , and infrastructure , and so on . 
  the aggregate effect of those is that money flows from the wealthy areas to the poorer areas and the currency area becomes more stable . 
  that does n't happen in anywhere near a big enough way within the eu , and the transfers that do exist with cohesion funding are not designed to handle economic shocks in the way , say , federal unemployment benefits can achieve . 
   in fact if you asked new yorkers if they wanted to subsidise california well , if you phrased it in such a loaded way , sure . 
  if you ask things like ` do you agree that unemployment benefits should be funded at the federal unemployment benefits ' the answer would be very different ' . 
  ask that same question in the ez ... yeah , that 's unlikely to get approval . 
   the other major one is that the last thing europe needs now is further instability . 
  if they were implementing treaty changes that the markets thought were necessary , it would n't represent instability . 
  the only reason it would be unstable would be if there was the chance of it being rejected by some people . 
  it all comes back to the lack of the democratic mandate for the necessary changes . 
  it 's a problem because it 's happening in the us but not in the eu . 
  for it to actually work properly , you 'd likely need a proper federal government ; that 's not politically palatable to the eu 's peoples ( yet/ever ) . 
  what the guy probably meant was a reference to how britain 's euroscepticism - in the eyes of / r/europe and non-brits only - stems from the loss of it empire . 
  any euroscepticism has to come from that , and not any rational grounds , so therefore the czech republic must have lost an empire ??? 
   the czech republic already signed up to the euro . 
  now it 's only a question of when , not whether . 
  without a major change to the political system , it is a question of ` if ' . 
  there are so man stages that the czech government can drag their feet on that , ultimately , they can delay it indefinitely . 
  having that option is a de facto opt out from their treaty obligations to accede to the ez . 
  ( and let 's be real , there 's no way the eu in its current form would be able to force any member state to change its currency to the euro * and * it would just be inviting instability into their midst . 
  a member their by force is not necessarily one that the markets think will stay , and so it becomes a target ) . 
   `` we must defend our precious homeland from the merkeldollar ! '', 
  that 's a gross mischaracterisation of the debate on the uk acceding to the ez . 
  of those with the political awareness to identify merkel , there 's far more focus on the likes of gordon brown 's five tests ( and the failing grade that each of those criteria would deliver ) than simply crying ` muh sovereingties ' . 
  the political leaders , or at least their advisers , who are against joining the euro recognise that the structure is badly formed ; that there is n't the political will in the ez to fix those ; and that there will likely never be the democratic authorisation from the british people to join such a reformed system ( fiscal transfers ... ) . 
  hell , even most voters are aware enough to know that it 's a bad economic proposition ( for us ) . 
  when the scottish indyref was ongoing , there was a lot of discussion about the implications of a currency union and many were paying attention . 
  it 's way beyond simply ignorant ukipery . 
  yeah , that would n't happen .
