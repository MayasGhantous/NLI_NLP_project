i doubt the rest of the uk would block scotland 's entry to the un . 
  how would that be in their interests ? 
  they let us have a referendum , they 're not playing that unfair ? 
  surely any more changes would require a new treaty ? 
  yeah , in terms of governments coming to international things like that , i do n't think i 'm too cynical to suggest that they 'll pick a position , and then find the justification later ;p, 
  as i said , the negotiations with the uk govt could happen * before * a vote . 
  and i 'm pretty sure the negotiations with the uk govt would have to start immediately , while the eu ones would have a slight delay , since the scottish govt would still need permission from the uk govt to go and negotiate anyway ... 
  they would n't be bound by the euro obligation until * after * they were independent , one could argue . . 
  but this is getting way into the hypotheticals haha, 
  again , that comes down to timings . 
  if a cu was negotiated before they got into proper eu negotiations , then they could n't argue that . 
  it 's probably one of the reasons that the scottish govt wanted to negotiate about some of these things * before * the first referendum , so that the people had some idea of what either a yes or a no would mean . 
   what currency would scotland use ? 
  again that comes down to the negotiations . 
  you could argue , further complicating things , that if scotland was in a currency union with the rest of the uk and had no central bank , it would fail to meet the euro criteria and thus be ineligible to ever join . 
  indeed , if you follow that train of thought , if scotland ** wanted ** to join the euro , it would have to * create * a currency ( pegged to the pound or the euro ? ), 
  and a central bank to then get rid of them again . 
  they 've got no formal opt out like the uk does , but if you do n't like that example , you can easily use poland or the czech republic or anyone that joined post-maastricht and is avoiding the euro with a barge pole . 
  a double-referendum is an interesting idea , but raises more questions . 
  what if the people vote yes to negotiations , but then refuse what was negotiated ; how many times can you go back to them before the first one `` runs out '' ? 
   they have no drive to make anything better lord foulkes says the exact opposite . . ( my post was removed 'cause it linked to wordpress , but basically , he accused the snp of ** deliberately ** making services better in scotland than in england ) if they 're not doing well , they would n't have won a majority in the scottish parliament in 2011 ; something the electoral system was designed to prevent , and they certainly would n't be looking to voted in for a third term !, 
  or the papers wanted you to think she said that ... 
  the `` obligation '' to join the euro is meaningless though , as long as membership of erm ii is voluntary . 
  plenty of nations have this `` obligation '' and ignore it , and the eu 's pretty much said in each case that there 's nowt they can do ( see ollie rehn 's statements on sweden or whatever ) . 
  as for t he outcomes not being known , indeed . 
  and that 's why some academics suggested that for scottish independence there should be two referendum , one giving the government the mandate to negotiate , and one to approve the conditions negotiated . 
  a country is not necessarily an * independent * country , hence the whole independence referendum thing . 
  it 's a country in a union with another . 
  we do `` send more money than we get back '' in order to pay for reserved areas of policy . 
  absolutely agree with everything you 've said . 
  the point of scotland 's membership negotiations would be that they * could be * ( if the rest of the uk and eu agreed ) negotiated internally , rather than externally . 
  if we had voted yes in sept 2014 , we would n't actually be independent yet . 
  the scottish government suggested a timetable which would see us independent march 2016 . 
  that would give you these 18 months to sort these things out to ensure a smooth transition , which i think would be in everyone 's best interests . 
  there was mocking of this at the time at being optimistically short , but the idea is there ... you sort all of this out before the transfer of powers , so that there 's minimum disruption . 
  absolutely catelonia , but it 's unwise to oversimplify complex issues like this i think . 
  the spanish govt * would * be leant on heavily by industries who would n't want to see scotland leave . 
  also , it depends on timescales and what happens in catalonia between now and then . 
  do you think that the powers of the westminster parliament and associated british state apparatus are analogous to the pooling of sovereignty in an eu context ? 
  have you got a source for sturgeon saying 2021 ? 
  all the stuff i 've seen is that she 's going to put a list of `` triggers '' in her next manifesto , which she thinks would be big enough to cause another independence referendum . 
  things such as scotland voting differently from the ruk when it comes to the eu . 
  scottish waters leaving the eu would lead to at least a decimation of the spanish fishing fleet . 
  although they like to talk the talk on the big stage to address domestic secession issues , they would find intense lobbying from their own people on that front . 
   so if i see correctly portugal , bulgaria and iceland are the only countries that would stay within same borders . 
  this map has ireland 's borders changing . 
  that would be a fascinating poll !, 
  to rank the other nations of the world and see in which order of preference people had . 
  you 're creating a strawman there . 
  the irish in this thread are n't saying ireland is a land of milk and honey , they 're just saying they think it 's doing better , comparatively , than it would be doing if it were still part of the uk . 
  levelling accusations of sophistry is nothing but hypocritical . 
   england does not even have it 's * [ sic ] * own parliament . 
  it is run by the uk government and scottish mp 's * [ sic ] * can vote in it . 
  english mp 's * [ sic ] * can not vote in the scottish parliament however . 
  that 's a bit of a non sequitur though , as scottish mps ca n't vote in the scottish parliament either ; it 's a completely separate body . 
  with the implementation of evel , they ca n't vote on matters concerning england ( or england and wales ? ), 
  either any more in a lot of circumstances . 
  for the first time since the acts of union , the idea that all mps are created equal has been brought to an end . 
  i think we can all agree that the whole thing is a mess , and a bit unsustainable . 
  reducing the powers of the scottish mps is n't the solution . 
  who ? 
  england does n't have an olympic team ... 
  is the uk `` another country '' to scotland ? 
  i had thought that we were an integral part . 
  i do n't concur with your economic assessment when we just dont know the real size of our export markets and such , and when our own parliament does n't even have control of a majority of public spending . 
  from `` another country '' ? 
  i thought they came from the uk . 
  are they actually coming from germany or something ? 
  i do n't agree that `` benefiting the better off '' and `` hurting poorer people '' are the same . 
  the policy helps everyone . 
  euan mccoll is nothing short of deranged , he 's our equivalent of jan moir or something . 
  you might want to see this debate , which is really good , on the issue in / r/scotland : https://www.reddit.com/r/scotland/comments/3nc764/a_costly_promise_scrapping_tuition_fees_has/ you might also want to note that the number of students from such backgrounds is increasing in scotland faster than anywhere else . 
  we 've still got worse rates for inclusion than elsewhere , but we started off * way * behind , and are catching up quickly : http://www.sfc.ac.uk/statistics/higher_education_statistics/he_performance_indicators/participation_indicator_for_scottish_heis.aspx edit : also , http://newsnet.scot/citizen/disadvantaged-students-lack-scottish-english-evidence-means-no-firm-conclusions/ there 's a discussion on the issues with the data used in your articles . 
  how * dare * the democratically elected leader of our country carry out the manifesto she was returned to office on , right ? 
  our media are universally shocking at reporting on devolved issues like this . 
  you 'd think after 17 years we 'd be getting the hang of it now !, 
  i do n't know how effective the fund is or how it works , sorry , i would n't want to make any claims about it . 
  that 's what the tories put in their manifesto so , so that 's what england got . 
  labour in wales went for a different priority and the snp in scotland followed the welsh example . 
  all these things we get `` free '' are at the cost of other things . 
  we have just chosen to spend our money differently . 
  i think you should pay more attention to how the size of the scottish government 's budget is decided . 
  we 're not fiscally autonomous . 
  do you have evidence for free tuition hurting us poorest ? 
  it 's different political priorities . 
  take prescription charges , as an example . 
  the uk government , for england , set up a cancer drug fund , while wales , northern ireland and scotland decided to scrap prescription charges instead . 
  there 's just no media narrative about what england gets that we do n't ... 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's coming from the scottish budget . 
   there are n't many sections in government that equal . 
  there are in scotland . 
  the current scottish government have a strong commitment to universality of policy , for this , nursery provision , free school meals ( for younger children ) , free healthcare , no tuition fees ... 
  i 'm the same . 
  the judges made the right ( legal ) call . 
  if this couple want the law changed , they should lobby parliament , not the courts . 
  this is n't the states . 
  i do n't think i 've ever met anyone who 'd say `` ye '' like that . 
  at all . 
  my uni was an offshoot of your uni , and is similar aye . 
  fur was only for those doing vocational courses , so my jeweller friends got some , but i did n't ( doing humanities ) .
