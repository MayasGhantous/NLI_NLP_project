the ukip supporters will be happy about the distance out the uk is from europe, 
  hmm , maybe you 're right , i 'm too tired to read it now . 
  we were always taught that it is data that is quantified in computer systems , not information , and that information is much harder to quantify . 
  it 's also possible our disagreement is to do with different definitions of information . 
  things can be defined in multiple ways in different specialties ( e.g. 
  philosophy ) . 
  edit : indeed , having a quick skim of the wikipedia page indicates that `` information is taken as a sequence of symbols from an alphabet '' in information theory . 
  this was not the definition i was working from , i would have called this data . 
  it seems i was taught wrong . 
  edit2 : this is the distinction i was more working from :  `` the terms data , information and knowledge are frequently used for overlapping concepts . 
  the main difference is in the level of abstraction being considered . 
  data is the lowest level of abstraction , information is the next level , and finally , knowledge is the highest level among all three . 
  [ 21 ] data on its own carries no meaning . 
  for data to become information , it must be interpreted and take on a meaning . 
  for example , the height of mt. 
  everest is generally considered as `` data '' , a book on mt. 
  everest geological characteristics may be considered as `` information '' , and a report containing practical information on the best way to reach mt. 
  everest 's peak may be considered as `` knowledge '' . '', 
  ( wikipedia : data ), 
  `` the dog is fat '' is a statement of information , which contains semantic meaning . 
  i can change the amount of bytes without changing the amount of information : `` the dog thing is er fat '' . 
  as i can change the number of bytes whilst maintaining the same amount of information , it suggests that it is instead a measure of something else . 
  information is hard to quantity . 
  the number of bytes are also influenced by the encoding , meaning language used changes the bytes as well as data encoding options . 
  bits and bytes ultimately represent 0s and 1s , not the semantic content . 
  if i was pedantic i would say it 's actually the units of data , not information . 
  the other posters have come up with some good stuff . 
  some of the key ones which i agree with : * ** lack of a common european identity ** - we ( i am british , so there may be a bias ) feel much more in common with other members of our own country than with other europeans . 
  this is something wihch needs to be tackled . 
  we need to feel more european , as well as our own nationalities . 
  * ** limited communication between members of the eu ** - in other countries such as the us , there states are locked together with media , business arrangements and family in many different states . 
  people are commonly education in a different state to the one they are raised in . 
  in europe , that is present , but nothing like the extent it is in the usa . 
  we need to encourage erasmus student exchange , and increase european unity in business . 
  encourage integration and immigration , make it easy , and economically justifiable . 
  * ** democracy/logistics/bureaucracy ** - currently , the system is undemocratic , and burdened . 
  however , this is not a fundamental problem , and can be fixed . 
  * ** blaming the eu ** - the eu is so commonly used as a scapegoat for blame by national politicians , and others . 
  i do n't know how to fix this . 
  * ** common currency ** - i am * not * saying the euro is bad . 
  a common currency makes sense . 
  there does however need to be either systems in place to allow for different types of economies/decline of national economies * or * a common financial policy . 
  i would also like to add a few : * ** undecided integration ** - just how integrated does europe want to be ? 
  do we want a union of nations and unity through diversity , or something more concrete ? 
  traditionally , europe has done well through having multiple entities , allowing for diversity , where different ideas are tried , and the best then selected . 
  it allows for evolution . 
  i favour this approach personally , but it is something that needs to be decided . 
  * ** external manipulation ** - a common tactic to weaken enemies is to divide and conquer . 
  the current architecture of the eu means it is weak to this strategy , and is sure to become a common weapon amongst those who seek to weaken a common european voice . 
  we need to strive to hold together and reject irrational propaganda . 
  * ** limits of europe ** - in the future , it will be important to understand the limits of the eu 's mandate . 
  this will come into play particularly with russia . 
  russia is european , but there is never any discussion of whether it should be part of it . 
  with 140m people , it will dominate eu politics should it join , especially since it is culturally different . 
  additionally , what of turkey , the middle east and northern africa ? 
  historically , these areas have impacted on europe , and even been united ( e.g.roman empire ) . 
  what should happen to these areas ? 
   from the statistics below ( collected from w3schools ' log-files over a period of ten years ) , you can read the long term trends of browser usage . 
  not exactly representative of the internet though . 
  it 's a website used to teach web technologies . 
  the audience ( which is how they collected the data ) will be more tech savvy than the average user , thus leading to an artificially low value for ie, 
   ie only have around 15 % of overall market . 
  have you got any evidence for that ? 
  the [ figures ] ( http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/01/internet-explorer-ends-the-year-on-a-high-windows-8-slow-to-get-noticed/ ) i have seen put ie at above 40 % ( combined with mobile ) , and over 50 % on pcs . 
  but surely if there was more support for yorkshire independence , then a separate legal system could be provided , and then become a country in its own right , bonded together by common culture . 
  ultimately , depending on how far back you go , you can claim most places were countries once ( kingdom of jorvik , war of the roses , celts etc. ) . 
  i do n't think current country borders is a natural place to draw the line , otherwise how can new countries form ? 
  your argument is centred around the idea that scotland is a single integral unit , as is england . 
  this is not the case . 
  different parts of scotland and different parts of england vote for different parties , it 's not like the whole of england is voting for an english government while scotland votes for a scottish one . 
  your argument could also be applied to say that in the 1997 or 2005 election ( when labour won ) that the south was being undemocratically governed by scotland and the north of england , leading to laws which the majority of the south disagreed with . 
  also , where should this division end ? 
  if the shetlands wanted to declare independence , would scotland let it ? 
  how about just one town ? 
  or one house ? 
  i 'm not saying that that is necessarily wrong , but where should it end ? 
  edit : i 'm not saying i 'm against scottish independence , i am just questioning this particular argument for independence . 
  i mean , an independent yorkshire sounds like a good idea to me ... 
  your mine ... turtle !, 
  however , they however have the motto do n't be evil . 
  this is evil , even if not illegal , as they have found and used loop holes to avoid tax . 
  just like to point out hindi is an indo-european , although mandarin is n't . 
  i feel like the uk is no longer a tenable country for me . 
  scotland will leave and so will ni . 
  there will be no uk , and the remainder will be in a constant state of conservatism with the loss of kanpur and leftism in scotland . 
  there will less funding for science and cohesion . 
  if the eu breaks up we will not be able to compete with brics and the usa . 
  the indirect effects of this are terrible . 
  so do i , i did n't want to before , but now maybe i can move there !, 
  i just want to remind people that 48 % of brits want to stay , so please dont hate us all !, 
  i 'm relying on scotland leaving and then migrating there !, 
  actually , fat ( the store of energy by the body ) levels are directly linked to the energy balance of inputs vs. outputs . 
  if inputs are increased , yet outputs remain the same , we put on weight ( in the form of fat ) . 
  if outputs are reduced , but inputs remain the same , we add weight . 
  it really is that simple . 
  i think it 's more the reduced exercise that 's making us fat . 
  yes , i know that it sounds bad , but its true , and i was on my phone , so sources are harder to find . 
  interesting about breeder reactors , never heard of them before . 
  you pulled that number out of your arse . 
  according to a nuclear physicist i spoke to , he told me that there is only enough uranium to supply the worlds energy for less than a decade .
