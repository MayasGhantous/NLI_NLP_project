  the uk version is pretty good up until the last one ( the final cut ) , were it kinda loses it a bit . 
  the us one so far is pretty brilliant as well , kevin spacey is a god of acting . 
  a god !, 
  watch it if only for him . 
  it needs to reach turkey and from there go to the rest of europe . 
  also the saudi 's veto any proposed qatari pipeline that will go through their territory . 
  politics . 
  of course its not all french people . 
  as i said france is also simultaneously my favourite country and have many good friends from there who are very dear to me . 
  i love the place . 
  i just had to deal with too many parisians . 
  hahaha . 
  this is going to be completely biased i guess . 
  from : uk least favourite : france ( parisians ) most favourite : france ( the rest of those onion johnnies ) i have met enough stuck up , nose in the air , arrogant parisian twats to last me a lifetime . 
  my only enjoyment on meeting one of them is to see if i could look down my nose at them more than they can at me . 
  i usually lose . 
  you should also familiarise yourself with the counter arguments of that book main points . 
  it will give you a more nuanced outlook . 
  two definitions : 1 ) a pretentious european prick . 
  2 ) the best tv show ever . 
  yep . 
  when instability arrived in rwanda it began to spiral out of control . 
  it 's similar to how ethnic nationalism in korea was first brought in by the japanese . 
  there are few minorities there so its not much of a problem but it does mean there is a larger than average amount of xenophobia in the country . 
  yep , his wife was born and brought up in britain as well . 
  saif gadaffi is another university studying son of a arab dictator . 
  yep . 
  e.g eton , harrow etc, 
  the middle eastern royal families have very close links to the british establishment . 
  specifically the nations of oman , uae , kuwait , qatar and bahrain . 
  most if not all of the senior members attended public schools in the uk or graduated from the royal academy of sandhurst . 
  no where near that amount will make it to europe . 
  the burden of immigration will fall on jordan , iraq , iran , lebanon and turkey as it already has . 
  ** uk ** this is hard as there is a huge amount , and so i 'll only name three authors . 
  ** china mieville ** - one of britains most talented writers . 
  his work crosses steampunk and fantasy . 
  if you like any of those i would suggest starting out with the bas-lag series . 
  ** neil gaiman ** - he 's already pretty famous , and his novel coraline is already part of the uk school curriculum . 
  a very talented man , i would suggest starting with stardust . 
  ** charles stross ** - he 's what can only be described as a proper nerd . 
  i would suggest trying his eschaton series . 
  ( sci-fi ) bonus : ** jonathan strange & mr norrell ** - one of the best fiction books to come out of this country this past decade . 
  i would highly recommend giving it a go . 
  it 's long , but worth it . 
  x is coming . 
  great song . 
  from the uk , went on erasmus to sweden . 
  i didnt know the language but was able to pick up a little bit up . 
  it didnt really matter much since almost everyone spoke english anyway . 
  the one previous to it was also one of the largest in europe but it looked a bit dreary . 
  which reminds me ... i still have some fines to pay . 
  i 'm interested . 
  please go on . 
  bbc series called the great offices of state . 
  it is one of the better series looking into the inner workings of the british government . 
  they are about the 3 institutions at the heart of the uk government . 
  they deal in detail about the institutions and their relation to power . 
  how the civil service runs them and their influence in shaping british policy . 
  they speak to former and current ministers as well as former and current civil servants . 
  a [ teaser ( 28:10 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=fbxpp3njrik#t=1692 ) , they are asking the former civil servants and ministers if they spy on their european colleagues . 
  they all try to avoid giving a response but hint at yes . 
  home office - [ the great offices of state : 1 . 
  the dark department ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyghg8bmecw ) foreign office - [ the great offices of state : 2 . 
  palace of dreams ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbxpp3njrik ) the treasury [ the great offices of state : 3 . 
  the secret treasury ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=newdo_alqkq ), 
  [ speakers corner ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speakers%27_corner_\\ ( tv_series \\ ) ) perhaps ? 
  how the feck do you backup personal observation ? 
  he just stated what he saw . 
  he was speaking from personal opinion . 
  he didnt attempt to claim it was gospel . 
  get off your high horse . 
   it is the first time i am hearing about the the five eyes , and i 'm really frustrated by these anglo-saxon alliances . 
  they are alliances that were built up during the second world war , when these institutions were being formed and expanded . 
  they 've been working together before the existence of the eu . 
  it will take more time and cooperation in the eu for there to be any institutional trust between the uk and the eu , especially on matters related to security in the same way there is between the uk , the commonwealth realms and the us . 
  there is a common language , cultural similarities and a habit of cooperation that has developed . 
  it will take a long time to move away from that . 
  and a eu security framework like five-eyes would be unable to exist as currently relations stand , and if it did , to become effective it would need the full cooperation of france and the uk who have the global reach with their overseas territories and departments to make it remotely possible . 
  according to the most recent oecd 's report , when its adjusted for price levels rather than exchange rates , it has already overtaken the euro area and it is set to overtake the us in 3 years time ( 2016 ) . 
  so probably the whole eu a year or two after .

  everyone who has a tv pays a tax ( `` fee '' ) to fund the bbc . 
  it 's a public broadcaster . 
  it gets about a quarter of its funding from commercial enterprises abroad as well . 
  it is a massive organisation . 
  it 's the biggest broadcaster in the uk . 
  it is also the largest international broadcaster in the world . 
  it is also the largest news gathering organisation in the world . 
  it also has quite a few tv channels in the uk and abroad . 
  if you ever see the brits getting in another furore about the bbc , its because we all collectively pay for it . 
  most people seem to agree though that it is worth the money . 
  well it wasnt on tv , but there was a song by a semi-famous grime artist known as skepta here in the uk . 
  when i say it was porn , i mean porn not `` racy '' . 
  it 's was not on tv or even youtube . 
  but there are hilarious reaction videos , especially this [ one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwyiacyh-iy ), 
  it 's the main source of funding for the bbc . 
  i did not mean to imply that it was not rational or realist . 
  i was commenting on it , that 's all . 
  i happen to agree with it . 
  spy on everyone , even the french ... especially the french .
