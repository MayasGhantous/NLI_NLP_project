  i dont see france intervening in yemen or south sudan from the goodness of your hearts . 
  frankly , when they reach sierra leone we might start giving a shit . 
  otherwise help yourselves in francafrique . 
  this is being picked up much more recently as uk governmental reports come out . 
  the first to come out was actually a parliamentary report , the house of lords report on eu ( uk ) - russia relations . 
  it really emphasised this point that the eu as a whole is lacking a bit on language and analytical skills and what it recommends doing . 
  i have copied the relevant part of the report that details this a bit more for those who are interested . 
  i 've bolded some interesting parts . 
   ** member states : loss of analytical capacity **  56 . 
  witnesses told us that member states had lost analytical capacity on russia . 
  this , we judge , contributed to a concomitant decline in their ability to maintain oversight of the direction of the eu-russia relationship and , in particular , to monitor the political implications of the commission 's trade and technical programmes . 
  mr klaus recalled that there had been a historic asymmetry , whereby former communist countries `` knew the west much more than you knew the east '' , and that this asymmetry remained . 
  his excellency dr revaz gachechiladze , georgian ambassador to the uk , also noted that there was `` not a good understanding of russia in the west '' . 
  turning to recent events , ** mr lukyanov recalled that on the day of the crimean referendum , when the question had already been announced , he continued to receive disbelieving calls from european diplomats saying : ``` it can not happen . 
  it is just a bluff ' . '' ** he warned us that with `` this level of analysis , i am afraid that more surprises are to come , and not only from russia . '' dr casier agreed that there was a `` huge need for more knowledge about the local situation both in russia and in the eastern partnership countries . '' this was where `` we have to build much stronger analytical capacity . '' dr casier pointed out that president yanukovych 's decision not to sign the association agreement ( aa ) ** `` had been the subject of speculation in the ukrainian press long before he announced his decision , but took the eu by total surprise . '' **  58 . 
  mr josef janning , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , noted that while there remained experienced diplomats in national capitals , there had been a shrinking of the `` strategic space '' within ministries of foreign affairs , in which to `` go through the options and do analysis '' . 
  the rt hon david lidington mp agreed that there was a gap in knowledge and analysis , and judged this to be a function of time and of `` various assumptions '' made about russia during the gorbachev and yeltsin years . 
  these meant that , by the beginning of 2014 , ** `` there were very few officials in any government department or agency , here or elsewhere , who had personal professional experience of working with the old soviet union before it collapsed . '' during our informal discussions we were told that a similar situation prevailed in other member states as well . 
  speaking about the european external action service ( eeas ) , mr vimont defended european diplomacy . 
  he was `` rather impressed by the level of expertise we found at the european level compared to the expertise i could find in the french foreign office . '' mr dmitry polyanskiy was also impressed by the eu 's linguistic ability . 
  in his experience he had come across `` certain persons speaking russian at the same level as we do , so it is more or less their native tongue . '' he assessed eu analytical capacity differently : the 2004 eu enlargement to eastern europe and the baltic states had brought into the eu voices which were more critical towards russia , which had become more prominent within the eu . 
  in his view , this had contributed to the `` fact that the analysis of situations in russia during recent years has changed a lot from what it was five , six or seven years ago . ''  61 . 
  mr lough viewed it as part of a broader loss of `` our capacity to deal with russia . '' he said that an important part of the issue was that eu member states had lost an understanding of the `` historical factors that have shaped russia 's existence , the idiosyncrasies of the soviet union , and the legacy of that soviet experience . '' without that experience it was `` difficult for policymakers to make sense quickly of what russia is doing in ukraine , what its logic is and where this might lead . '' this was , he said , a `` huge deficiency right across our systems . '' dr shevtsova pointed out that diplomacy , however brilliant , could not act when the eu had `` no strategy or coherent vision '' , leaving diplomats `` to fight for an understanding on how to proceed . '' ** she judged that diplomats were doing what they could `` within the circumstances of european paralysis . '' **  ** uk diplomacy **  62 . 
  sir tony brenton believed that uk diplomacy was `` pretty good '' , but that it had `` suffered because of a loss of language skills , particularly in the foreign office . '' this had had a direct effect on the capacity of the fco to respond to recent events . 
  there was ** `` quite lot of complaint in whitehall after the annexation of crimea that the foreign office had not been able to give the sort of advice that was needed at the time . '' **  63 . 
  mr rory stewart mp has also written about the shrinking of the strategic space and the loss of deep political and cultural knowledge in the fco . 
  in 2014 he wrote : `` people have not been encouraged to devote their intellect and experience to asking hard questions about strategy . 
  we have not learned the lessons of our recent failures . 
  foreign office reforms in 2000 reduced the emphasis on historical , linguistic and cultural expertise , and instead rewarded generic ` management skills . ' instead , many of our officials in all departments remain distracted by hundreds of emails and tied to their desks , unable to spend significant time , deeply focused on the politics of other cultures . ''  64 . 
  mr neil crompton , deputy political director at the fco , told us in september 2014 that in response to the crisis the fco directorate with responsibility for dealing with the crisis had been strengthened with a `` 25 % uplift in staff -- an additional 13 staff -- to deal with ukraine and russia '' . 
  this was a response to the immediate demands of the crisis as well as recognition of the fact that russia was `` a challenge we will be dealing with for many years to come . '' in december , the minister told us that other government departments had also `` increased their staff resource for dealing with russia and ukraine . ''  ** russian understanding of the eu **  65 . 
  mr lukyanov told us that within russia understanding of the eu and its internal processes was `` very poor '' and , as the old generation had retired , the new generation was not ready to replace them , which was `` a big problem . '' russia was now trying to rebuild that capacity and he hoped that the expertise would improve as the emphasis on european studies grew . 
   ** conclusions and recommendations **  66 . 
  there has been a decline in member states ' analytical capacity on russia . 
  this has weakened their ability to read the political shifts and to offer an authoritative response . 
  member states need to rebuild their former skills . 
  while there has been an increase in staff at the fco to deal with ukraine and russia , we have not seen evidence that this uplift is part of a long-term rebuilding of deep knowledge of the political and local context in russia and the region . 
  we recommend that the fco should review how its diplomats and other officials can regain this expertise . 
  there is also a reduced emphasis on the importance and role of analytical expertise in the fco . 
  the fco should review how such skills could be renewed and how analysis can feed into decisionmaking processes . 
  the ambassador to the eu . 
  they did mention this :  does the leader run their country and set its political agenda ? 
  ( question marks hang over poland and france in this regard ) but its balanced out by the strong ambassador . 
   chapter xi of the united nations charter embodies a `` declaration on non-self-governing territories '' which declares that the interests of the occupants of dependent territories are paramount and requires u.n. member states in control of non-self-governing territories to submit annual information reports concerning the development of those territories the interests of the occupants of dependant territories are paramount . 
  that 's why britain went to war ( and also why reagan did in fact help and support us during it ) . 
  when the falkland islanders decide to they want independence or to join argentina and we refuse , that is when we will be contravening the un charter . 
  this is all about passporting , as expected since its an interview with the financial times , which everyone seems to be ignoring here . 
  what macron said :  `` so those who pretend that passporting will be preserved exactly following the same rules without any contribution to the budget , are making a big , a big mistake because it 's completely wrong , '' macron added . 
  he is saying if the uk wants passporting , they will need to pay . 
  passporting may or may not be part of a trade deal , but regardless its important and we will need it if we leave . 
  what is [ passporting ] ( https://www.the-fca.org.uk/passporting?field_fcasf_sector=unset&amp;field_fcasf_page_category=unset ) ? 
  basically any financial firm in london that has passporting rights from the uk financial authority , can sell financial products or services across the eu even without having a branch in the country its selling in . 
  this is how swiss and us firms in london do business across europe . 
  they have headquarters in london and can sell to slovenia even if there is no goldman or ubs branch there . 
  there are ways around it , you can have a subsidiary in the eu to do it for you . 
  but that has its own detrimental effects . 
  while the swiss use london because they dont have passporting rights , they 're exports of financial services has done worse than the uk 's , even though their financial service industry as a whole has done better than the uk 's [ * ] ( http://www.investmenteurope.net/regions/brexit-loss-of-passporting-rights-could-halve-uk-exports/ ) . 
  it 's not the best solution . 
  why is it important ? 
  we have one of the largest trade surpluses in services in the world . 
  in financial services its especially large , so its quite important that the services we export are not detrimentally affected . 
  similar to how the germans wont want to stop selling us cars . 
  we do not want to limit how effectively we export our services . 
  i dont believe they pay taxes to the uk and they are not part of the union . 
  i could n't go to live there tomorrow like i could go to aberdeen . 
  that 's why i was asking . 
  there is no devo max because they would have to actually be a part of the uk . 
  under our sovereignty . 
  my understanding is our relationship with the crown dependencies is quite weird and different from our overseas territories . 
  they are not ours but the crowns , but because the crowns affairs in the uk and channel islands are run by privy councillors ( i.e. 
  [ uk ministers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/privy_councillor_with_responsibility_for_the_crown_dependencies ) ) and our agreement to take care of their defence and foreign affairs , thats where our relationship comes in . 
  but even the crown is separated , the crown that owns the uk is different from the crown that owns jersey . 
  and its by convention that the crown in jersey is run by the privy council . 
  parliament can technically force them to do something but that hasnt been used in centuries i think and untested after all these recent changes ( the crown no longer being just one in the uk ) . 
  because they are separated from the uk , they can turn around and tell us to fuck off . 
  we may try to force them to do something using really untested and ancient legislation , but in the end its their choice to be coerced or not . 
  i think thats why we backed off . 
  genuine question , how can they threaten to leave something they are not a part of ? 
  if anyone is interested that is syed kamall , the current head of the uk conservative party in the european parliament and leader of the third largest political group in the european parliament , the european conservatives and reformists . 
  it won the prize for whisky of the year ( whisky bible award ) the previous year , this year is a canadian whisky . 
  he did n't abdicate because of his nazi views . 
  he abdicated because he wanted to break convention and marry a twice divorcee . 
  the government said no , so he stepped down . 
   for example the london metals exchange could easily relocate to belgium and trade in $ . 
  the lme doesnt trade in pounds , but in dollars . 
  secondly its owned by hong kong , who if they could , would have moved it to hong kong a while ago . 
  thirdly , start trading in euros instead of dollars ? 
  the dollar is the prime trading currency and the world reserve currency , that is not changing because 60m people left the eu . 
  can you link to this goldman sachs report that gives the example of the lme ? 
  it seems hard to believe they think it will relocate to belgium . 
  i dont know if that is serious really . 
  seriously ? 
  the lme runs 90 % of all metal trading in the world . 
  london wont lose that position to any city in europe , brexit will mean it loses its position to the other global players . 
  europe is a increasingly smaller and smaller player in many markets . 
  a lot of the assurances the city wants is not because it fears it will be overtaken by frankfurt ( that has been and gone ) , but by singapore or that it will fall way behind ny . 
  it 's part of a wider global picture which is has moved to the economic centre of the world to the pacific and away from the atlantic . 
  and the city has been doing a hell of a lot to make sure that does n't affect them and their profits . 
  should have worded it better . 
  i mainly meant you are retiring early , so you have money , if its in another country you should pay for it not the uk taxpayer because of the aforementioned money .
