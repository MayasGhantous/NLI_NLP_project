  was n't trying to get into whether one is cheaper than the other . 
  its actually getting surprisingly close . 
  lots of retirees have been leaving spain since the crisis and thousands of young spaniards are arriving monthly to the uk . 
  i think they were roughly tied with the italians these past few years as the third largest nationality registering to work in the uk . 
  after poland and romania . 
  not sure how the numbers look in the latest figures but i would n't be surprised if the difference has n't narrowed . 
  if you are a uk state pension receiver living in spain , the uk nhs covers your health costs in spain . 
  if you are an early retiree , it stopped covering it in 2014 , so new applicants do n't get it . 
  mainly i think because if you are retiring early in another country , you have money , so get it yourself . 
  or maybe corbyn doesnt even trust himself about the eu . 
  the labour party remember are the traditional euroskeptics , and were only won over by the incredible jaque delors and his arguments of a eu being a socialist force for good for all europeans . 
  the labour party bought into this argument and fell in love with it . 
  the result being an eventual labour uk government , that gave up much of the rebate and pushed for more eu expansion and integration . 
  now however , this argument/idea is beginning to disintegrate with the rhetoric and intransigent attitude to the socialist government in greece . 
  this has increased with the election of corbyn who is one of the old school left who never fully bought into delors and his idea , and has been a soft euroskeptic since . 
  so they can try to force a split but they need to be united on a position and the party in general is a shambles . 
  the mps dont like their leader , the base loves their leader , the general public is ambivalent or negative . 
  a few labour euroskeptic mp 's have already stated they will vote brexit . 
   one more interesting bit is some tories eurosceptic heavy-weights have not yet announced their positions , like boris johnson . 
  which i guess implies he thinks being on the loosing side of the referendum would hit his future chances . 
  indeed . 
  but he has a different consideration as your last sentence points out . 
  the ministers who have already come out are those who dont have a shot at the pm position next election ( cameron is due to step down ) like michael gove . 
  or party bigwigs like chris grayling who sit on the cabinet but dont have ministerial positions but also have no chance . 
  the ones who currently have a shot at succeeding cameron will be the ones to look out for : george osbourne ( in ) theresa may ( in ) boris johnson ( undecided - 50/50 ) but the current tory party has 330 mps , a lot could have pm aspirations and could easily begin trying to make their name during the campaign . 
  more than a handful are also incredibly euroskeptic . 
  it could easily become 60-40 backing the eu or even 50-50 . 
  70 of their mps have already decided to back brexit . 
  so the split in the party is interesting to watch . 
  indeed its more of a what-if if there is n't a norwegian like arrangement . 
  in any case i agree i think there will agreements from both sides making the whole issue moot . 
  however these concessions ( one of them i 'm certain will be something resembling passporting rights ) will most likely limit the damage to a lot of the industries vital to uk-eu trade ( financial services , manufacturing , etc ) that the major nations are involved in , but will have a limited focus on the key irish export sectors which look like they will take a hit . 
  it will be hard to get a concession for irish agriculture when the discussions will be focused on if mercedes and citreon can sell with limited impact . 
  which going back to the main point , i was slightly surprised at your incredible optimism and hope for a brexit seeing as it seems to be on balance undecided and maybe even bad for ireland . 
  it 's good to hear it would be limited in some sense . 
  but there seems certain sectors that will have considerable issues , agriculture and energy in particular , especially with employment . 
  reading a report by the ntma seems to suggest that while exports to the uk are 16 % , the employment in those sectors heavily reliant on uk exports are 30 % * . 
  especially with a slow eurozone , uk growth has been having a good affect on irelands resurgence . 
  a slow eurozone , limited global growth with asia slowing down and brexit seems to be a recipe for another recession for ireland . 
  additionally , i think the uk will most likely leverage everything to keep passporting rights , which will limit a lot of the upside for ireland . 
  especially the predicted fda inflows from financial firms . 
  i wouldnt be surprised if the uk doubles down on the passporting and without eu rules begins using low tax incentives more ruthlessly ( than even ireland ! ), 
  to keep foreign firms in . 
  it seems to be more of an opaque situation than one with considerable upside to ireland .

   anyway it 's in my longterm business interests for the uk to leave , as being outside the eurozone is already sending uk business my way !, 
  so selfishly i 'll be voting for the uk to leave wo n't the damaging affects to the rest of the irish economy offset that ? 
  we call it cabinet collective responsibility , and indeed that is the usual course of business . 
  because how can the the country have confidence in the executive if the executive can not agree with itself ? 
  however there are things called free votes which are applied sporadically . 
  it 's usually applied to the parties backbench mp 's not in government but it has been applied a few times in the past century to ministers as well . 
  the biggest example is the last eu referendum in the 1970 's when the pm gave the cabinet a free vote . 
  like cameron 's party now , the labour party back then was split on the eec question , the only way the pm could see to resolve the split was not to force them into making a vote for membership ( and thereby have a mass resignation which could ultimately culminate in the fall of the government ) but to let the ministers vote how they wished on the matter . 
  cameron essentially facing the same dilemma followed the precedent set in the 70 's . 
  as for the weakening of its legitimacy , it depends on the rhetoric , but its definitely will do . 
  but balancing out the cost of that with major ministers actually resigning and causing a even more fatal split within your party , its probably worth that price . 
  especially because the opposition is very weak and they might actually get away with it . 
  they were voted in by their constituents so they have n't lost a popular vote to be an mp . 
  so they wont resign as mp 's . 
  their role as minsters in the cabinet is at the discretion of the prime minister and not related to a popular vote . 
  as he has already said they are free to make their choice on the issue , if they win or lose , they should n't lose their position as that was never stated as a condition by the pm beforehand . 
  although if one or two do say some crazy stuff - especially about the pm - during the lead up , they make put it at risk . 
  the un high commissioner is not the same thing as the un human rights council . 
  the latter is the one states including saudi arabia are involved in ( they also do n't head anything , they chair one of the panels in the council ) . 
  the former is a part of the un and that is the one criticising zeman . 
  so i do n't think it 's the media forgetting to mention anything . 
  i 'm sorry but i 'm not sure if i did say i was cool with that . 
  besides this is not a brutality measuring contest , but there is a reason why the assads are so hated within syria and the wider world . 
  they are the same type of baathist butchers that saddam was . 
  hama in the 80 's and other incidents attest to that . 
  the gulf countries for all their sickening behaviour do not casually massacre their citizens . 
  they bribe them off with their oil money and suppress dissent with occasional executions which while horrific is not the same league as the brutality of those in syria . 
  dont make me laugh , he kills just as much as they do . 
  its just that his torture is done in dark prisons not on social media . 
  there as brutal as each other .

  during the 5 months of arab spring protests before the fsa rebel group was formed , the government killed upto 2,000 civilians . 
  protestors . 
  this is not going into his families long history of terror , suppression , torture and massacres during and before the war . 
  the mining boom happened there . 
  now that china is slowing down and not voraciously consuming raw materials at the same level expect that outflow to slow down . 
  you can already see the slowdown affecting the australian economy and engineering projects in particular . 
  you are using two ridiculous calculations . 
  when you say mid-size you are speaking specifically about the size of the economy , not the wealth of its citizens . 
  china is a large economy , its citizens are not wealthy . 
  so a per capita calculation is not remotely relevant to this discussion . 
  we are not calling luxembourg a large economy ( even if its a wealth one ) . 
  and ppp maybe useful if we are discussing living standards , etc. 
  not when we are talking about size which would only make sense in using a nominal scale . 
  it makes no sense to use ppp to compare the size of economies between countries , its there to understand the internal dynamics of a countries economies or compare their citizens purchasing power .

  unfortunately i lost it during the great brexit wars . 
  one misplaced statistic was thrown at me and before i knew what was going on , it was gone . 
  i do n't like to talk about it much . 
  sweet , we can add the falklands after that . 
  im sure you 've seen the austerity programs in large amounts of countries across europe . 
  especially speaking about the uk , we have lots of ways to cut our budget and save money . 
  but we dont follow what makes budgetary sense all the time , in fact , the majority of the time budget cuts are political decisions and not economic ones . 
  i think that argument can easily be laid out here .
