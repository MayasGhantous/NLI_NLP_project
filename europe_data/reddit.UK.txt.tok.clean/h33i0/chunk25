  apologies too about salazar , we diverted profits from harrods which he then used them stabilise himself . 
  apologies about him too , it was a long winded one but we did get him into power . 
  the head of mi6 was a fan of some art pieces he had , so ceausescu sold it at sothebys , and we began a fruitful career of funding him with bbc profits . 
  indeed , when monty python went global , the money kept him in power for another few decades . 
  ( hopefully you wont find out about our current manipulation of the eu . 
  brexit is just the beginning , our eventual aim is force you all to become one country and so it will be the uk vs the eu in every eurovision but the song language will have to be english . 
  gon na finally win that thing again . ), 
  those that signed up , fought , and died did not do so out of geopolitical self-interest . 
  the country was in a state of total war with every element of society fighting , you do not go to that extent out of geopolitical self-interest . 
  those that made the choice to use up the resources of the largest empire in history just for this fight , did not do so because it was geopolitical self-interest . 
  geo-political self interest is actually staying out of another european war ( 20 years after the last one ) and using your resources to govern your empire and not waste it fighting . 
  an agreement with the british was sought by hitler , he did not want to fight us , he admired the uk . 
  we wanted to fight him . 
  to be honest , we could have been like portugal , or the usa ( in the beginning ) sat on the sidelines content in knowing he wont cross the channel and watched the lamps go out on the continent . 
  we basically paid for pro-allies propaganda in italy when it looked like they might drop out of the war . 
  this involved sending spies there to boost morale . 
  i 'm sure the # 100 a week we sent to mussolini ( with plenty more going to anyone in support of the war ) was what financed his rise though . 
  urm ... they are the ones who started the investigation . 
  the culture secretary delayed the bid and last week referred it to ofcom and the competition and markets authority . 
  the culture secretary :  having carefully considered the representations from the parties and the other representations that i have received , i can now tell the house that i have today issued a european intervention notice on the grounds of media plurality and commitment to broadcasting standards . 
  i have written to the parties , ofcom , and the competition and markets authority to inform them of my decision . 
   as i have previously set out , the decision will now trigger action by ofcom to assess and report to me on the public interest grounds i have specified , and by the cma to report to me on jurisdiction . 
  they each have 40 working days to prepare and provide these reports . 
  this means that i will expect their reports by tuesday 16 may . 
  i will then resume my decision-making role in relation to the merger . 
   since my `` minded to '' decision , i have also received just over 700 representations from third parties , the vast majority of which supported intervention . 
  a number of those representations called for me to create a new public interest consideration , which would require a fit and proper assessment of the parties to the merger to take place as part of the intervention process . 
  they also argued that it should be made clearer that matters of corporate governance , accountability and conduct could be taken into account in assessing this merger . 
  cheers , that makes more sense now . 
  the ft is better then the guardian by the same country mile . 
  as are the times when it comes to factual reporting and not opinion pages/columnists ( were the times employs absolute idiots ) . 
  the guardian are in full blown crisis mode because the last editor decided massive global expenditure is what to do when you have declining sales and slowly running out of your dead millionaires pile of money . 
  their cosiness with advertising is not at the telegraphs level of whoring yet , but they are moving in the same direction . 
  wasnt it not that long ago their columnists and readership were railing against zero-hour contracts while they were at the same time using them to the fullest . 
  its not really a beacon , although since its free its preferable to all the other free online newspapers . 
  he makes some good points about the alarmism . 
  afterall the sun was practically salivating at the prospect . 
  in their line of work , any drama is good drama . 
  but the talk of billionaires is a bit rich coming from the dutch . 
  at least there are a few competing ones here , you just have the puijenbroek family and van thillo . 
  i was asking mainly out of curiosity , as i got all that information and article from wikipedia . 
  thanks for the response . 
   article is writen by bosnian muslim so it is very biased . 
  and muslims did not migrated from bosnia in that time period . 
  it was in a-u when they had all their land and privileges . 
  i actually assumed the book would be more balanced as it was a published by a croatian organisation . 
  i must be wrong . 
  im not sure i understand your second sentence , so they left during the au period when their wealth was protected but stayed when it was taken ? 
  it seems to be a bit bizarre if your religious group has masses of land being taken away and you decide to continue staying ? 
   if you believe how it is fair that small muslim elite holds 91.1 % of land as legacy from feudal system it is wrong . 
  well my personal opinion is sometimes ... i think bygones are bygones . 
  you should see how much land those french norman still own in england . 
  slow redistribution is always for the best , but i get your point . 
   in bosnia it was not forced for sure . 
  it also includes the early 20th century . 
  the kingdom of yugoslavia in contrast , seems to have been quite discriminatory ( i.e. 
  [ stealing land ] ( http://www.hic.hr/books/seeurope/010e-semiz.htm ) etc ) to bosnian muslims ? 
  it seems the post has been removed , anyway i thought i 'd point out , while its not a pleasant statistic , its not actually particularly alarming . 
  the nhs actually has bigger things to worry about . 
  to give some perspective , this is the [ nationality of nhs staff ] ( https://i1.wp.com/secondreading.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/one-nhs-many-nationalities.jpg ) . 
  for nurses in particular , what this shows is that there is a drop in recruitment in [ 7 % of its nursing workforce ] ( https://i2.wp.com/secondreading.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nhs-area-of-work.jpg ) . 
  its a significant enough chunk but 93 % of its recruitment has shown no signs of dropping . 
  the proportion of eu nurses will drop as other nationalities ( particularly philippines , zimbabwe etc ) come in . 
  they usually go on recruitment drives abroad to get a whole slew of nurses in , once this becomes an issue i imagine they will do that again . 
  bear in mind it only reached its peak of 7 % only in the past few years , only with the recent influx of spaniards , italians and other mediterraneans ( helped by nhs recruitment drives in those countries ) . 
  lastly , this is a big issue in london where i live because the eu staff are disproportionately concentrated in london . 
  not many of them are in other parts of the uk . 
  those london hospitals wont have a particularly hard time recruiting , its not like its the same as being asked to work in the middle of nowhere valley , wales . 
  it 's not the number of eu national nurses , it 's the number eu nationals * registering * as nurses during the month of december compared to the month before the vote ... it 's in the first line of the article . 
  if it was the number of eu national nurses , it would be ~ 18,000 nurses leaving in 6 months . 
  which is ridiculous . 
   whether or not he has a few seats more or less than the pm 's party is entirely inconsequential . 
  the pm should know better , and he does , he 's a pretty bright fellow . 
  rutte does n't think so and i agree with him . 
  regardless if he is in government or not , by leading the largest party he is effectively the sole and largest voice of a significant chunk of the dutch electorate . 
  in this populist climate that is far from inconsequential and thats what rutte is saying . 
  it will send a signal , that this liberal tolerant european order , which the dutch personify in many ways , has begun to dismantle . 
  which is why he said the below :  geert wilders is leading the biggest party and that will send a signal to the rest of the world messages and signals like this are effective . 
  they make impressions , and once cemented , are hard to break . 
  they report the debt as well . 
  in the full report it shows a breakdown of financial-assets , non-financial assets , and then debt . 
  ** germany ** : financial | non financial | debt | gross wealth | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- 87,328 | 125,211 | 27,364 | 212,539 ** france ** : financial | non financial | debt | gross wealth --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- 107,953 | 169,772 | 33,360 | 277,725 maybe its the hartz reforms , didnt they directly impact wage growth ? 
  leaving many with [ low wages ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/business/global/many-germans-scrambling-as-economic-miracle-rolls-past.html ) and no house ownership culture means less assets in general ? 
  according to the report there is a significant higher number of dollar millionaires , which may fuel that perception . 
  about 2.2 k while germany and france are at 1.6 k. 
  its a complex issue with different ways to look at it . 
  depending on how you use the underlying statistics you really can paint any picture . 
  the thing is though wealth takes a lot of things into account , including financial and non-financial assets . 
  houses , savings , investments etc. 
  the median wealth is above 100k which sounds about right . 
  this plus balanced mix between financial and real assets is probably why . 
  the recession also took a big hit to most peoples wealth ( house prices falling , equity taking a hit etc ) which may have added some equality . 
  its also important to note a lot of the talk you read about the uk is from uk media sources . 
  so when they discuss issues in the uk its almost always relative , if we are doing badly at x , y or z a lot of the times its because they are comparing the performance of the uk in that area to the best in the world . 
  so while it could just be we are performing averagely , it would be categorised as a disaster depending on if it furthers a right/left point they are trying to make . 
  edit : btw , here is the report ( pdf ) : http://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=ad783798-ed07-e8c2-4405996b5b02a32e its good reading . 
   you did n't have any obligation . 
  but it did show the lack of solidarity . 
  like how the eurozone showed solidarity in bailing out our crashing financial system a few years beforehand right ? 
  afterall the greek bailouts were mainly bailing out exposed [ eurozone private creditors and banks ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/most-of-greek-bailout-money-went-to-banks-study/a-19234391 ) , the eurozone could have done the same and helped us .
