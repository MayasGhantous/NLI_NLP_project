  the major states like ethiopia are a conglomerate of different ethnic groups but in a redrawing would lose almost half their territory to the somali 's ( ogaden ) . 
  the kenyans would also lose out in the nfd to the somalis as well . 
  nigeria would cede to exists in its current form , there would have to be a large number of ethnic states or a religious divide . 
  the issues with sa are clear , exacerbating ethnic tensions in not in their interest , neither is redrawing borders to create e.g. 
  other nations like morocco have breakaway regions that they intend to rule once again , bringing up a redrawing borders would give strength to the western sahara cause . 
  it will also give strength to countless other independence movement across the continent . 
  issues like this are why its not brought up . 
  this is not even going into smaller and more mundane considerations like leaders/people not wanting to lose power , authority and privilege that they enjoy in the current set up . 
  because having an empire and being primitive are contradictory . 
  being primitive denotes being in an early phase of human development . 
  by that very nature , a primitive society is unable to support a large polity or political organisation like an empire . 
  it might seem obvious but africa is huge and sparsely populated . 
  most of these kingdoms you see on that link are comparable or much larger than modern european nations . 
  controlling something so large with relatively small populations naturally means fuzzy borders . 
  it was only until the scramble for africa that it was conquered . 
  this was in late 19th century at the height of european power that was caused by [ industrial revolution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_divergence ) . 
  this was the same time that india was being carved up , china was being subjugated etc and not something wholly unique to africa . 
  i dont think that qualifies as being `` primitive '' , unless you consider the rest of humanity outside of europe `` primitive '' . 
  this scramble was done when europes power vis a vis the rest of the world was the highest point in human history , at any point in time prior to this it would have been an impossible task . 
  and i would suggest reading the entry then simply looking at the map , the map makes east africa look sparse besides the ethiopians but there were large kingdoms across east africa like ajuuraan ( who kept the portuguese out of east africa for centuries ) . 
  you also have to understand that most of africa is sparsely populated , that west african region for example is as large if not larger than europe with a small population . 
  most of africas population growth has been in the 20th century . 
  so these kingdoms were limited to where large humans populations were mostly located . 
  ahh , the perfect blend of condescension and white mans burden . 
  africa has had a [ large amount ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/african_empires ) of non `` primitive '' civilizations , kingdoms and empires . 
  european colonialists did little but loot the place and draw lines for their benefit . 
  this site is run by some dude named yeagley , who among his most outrageous views are this :  in breivik 's passion one does hear the distant thunder of the great norwegian warrior , bodvar bjarki . 
  ah , that was a day when war was honorable , when destroying the enemy was noble and heroic . 
  today , the white oedipal liberals in charge of the world teach that to resist the enemy is unkind and bad . 
  in the instinct of latent homoexuality [ sic ] , the white leaders proclaim the darkies triumphant , and make every arrangement to allow them to bury all things white and descent -- particularly christianity . 
  the whole ` open door ' policy which allows murderous , barbarous islam to enter and destroy any nation is the perfect expression of the `` delusional '' white liberals . 
  [ 6 ] yea . 
  seems like he has a bit of a [ chip on his shoulder ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/david_yeagley ) . 
  thank you for the response !, 
  thank you for the ama ms. auken . 
  recently i 've read a paper called the brussels effect by anu bradford . 
  [ paper ] ( https://www.law.northwestern.edu/lawreview/v107/n1/1/lr107n1bradford.pdf ) , [ talk ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qefmr3fkjzw ) . 
  the main gist of her argument is that eu is a regulatory superstate that when it imposes standards in certain markets ( antitrust , privacy , food safety , environment etc - specifically in markets that require access to the single market ) they in effect become global standards . 
  this can be seen as the eu leveraging its market to impose unilateral standards on trading partners outside the eu . 
  a lot of the times these standards ended up with higher consumer standards in non-eu countries etc ** 1 ) ** so my question is when legislation is being drafted , is the effect of eu regulatory practises externalising onto trading partners outside the eu a part of the discussions ? 
  ** 2 ) ** is the eu ability to create global norms and externalise its standards through its regulatory practises a motivating factor or is it a inconsequential factor in drafting regulations ? 
  ** 3 ) ** lastly , in a similar way that the us has pivoted to asia , do you believe it is in the eu interests to do the same and devote more time and energy to the bodies like asem and the asean regional forum ? 
  or potentially joining the east asia summit ( if it is a possibility ) ? 
   true , but i still do n't understand the logic of how china would be seen as a threat over them . 
  the embargo was created after tiananmen square protests in 1989 . 
  a lot of eu nations would like to lift it but there is interference from the us and japan arguing against it for security reasons as well as germany , holland and the nordics for human right reasons . 
  yep they 're ordering and going to get some . 
  it 's not a huge issue but if we have the capabilities to develop an indigenous european design , like the rafale and typhoon , we should . 
  it 's not really helpful relying on the us to create important parts of our militaries for us . 
  drones are definitely the future though , which is why there is probably more insistence on it being produced and created in europe . 
  you dont want to fall too behind on that technology . 
  good good . 
  the french are finally getting others to pull their weight . 
  they are the leads for the dassault neuron project which is what this article is mainly alluding too . 
  with the uk continuing to develop [ taranis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bae_taranis ) and [ mantis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bae_systems_mantis ) this is a positive step for a european combat drone ( ucav ) project . 
  especially because of the uk and france defence alliance , they have committed themselves to developing the ucav drones together , the newest summit emphasised this and gave a [ two year feasibility study ] ( http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/dassault-and-bae-systems-welcome-anglo-french-ucav-pact-395445/ ) before it begins ( although after what happened with telemos , it may not reach the production stage ... ) . 
  the final design will probably be a combination of the work both bae and dassaults have done some way or another . 
  besides the combat ones , in surveillance drones ( male ) , the [ telemos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bae/dassault_telemos ) ( france and uk based on mantis ) has been scrapped and nobody is interested in the [ eads talarion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eads_talarion ) which means the us and israel are still dominating that market for european militaries . 
  the future european male program was not looking very good until recently . 
  this is a positive step as the main issue was funding and now that the eu and at least 7 nations are onboard it should proceed better , maybe the revival of talarion or something based on it . 
  we still have huge gaps though , nobody is even producing a [ fifth generation jet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifth-generation_jet_fighter ) . 
  but at least the drones are finally getting underway . 
  wisely staying clear , although xi and putin have a strong relationship ever since xi came into power . 
  `` we condemn the recent extreme violent behaviour in ukraine , and continue to urge all sides in ukraine to peacefully resolve their disputes within a legal framework , and conscientiously protect the legal rights all the peoples of ukraine , '' the chinese foreign ministry said in a statement on sunday . 
  although the [ unofficial press mouthpieces ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukraine-crisis-china-back-russia-cold-war-over-crimea-1438650 ) have all been supportive of russia stance . 
  but there is little to gain and plenty to lose with closely choosing sides , so they will continue being on the sidelines with this . 
  check out her speech to the us congress . 
  she starts off with a little english as well . 
  i think that was the first time she spoke it in public like that . 
  it is the conservatives . 
  the eu policy in the party brought down their `` greatest '' post war prime minister ( by pro-eu conservatives no less ) . 
  they can damn well do it again . 
  when the tories are in power , they will have to manage the people in their party as much as they manage their position in the eu . 
  a constructive role in the eu depends on the ruling party having a constructive party policy on the eu and that is a luxury that a conservative prime minister does not have . 
  as long as the tories dont have one cohesive united policy on europe , the uk-eu relationship will be volatile . 
  when delors spoke with labour in 88 and offered them his vision of europe , they finally began forming a cohesive united policy on europe behind that vision . 
  the original euroskeptics changed . 
  so its no wonder when the uk was at its most constructive within the eu it was with labour prime ministers . 
  the author being a `` labour candidate '' knows this full well . 
  cameron can not come out and not be obstructionist when parts of his party are terrified of ukip and the other parts are wondering whether they should be in europe at all . 
  it 's dysfunctional and will continue being dysfunctional until the elections . 
  maybe merkels speech will have the same effect as delors did in 88 , but i doubt it . 
  it seems what cameron is trying to do is build a policy behind any `` achievements '' he gets out of a deal and draws a red line from there on in . 
  the real problem for the eu is not giving into cameron , its that the uk is still not even the most anti-eu country within it . 
  the newest pew research puts them behind france , spain , greece and the czechs in that regard . 
  the dutch and scandinavians werent polled . 
  the real problem with a uk withdrawal is that the resentment towards the eu that is currently not being addressed by parliaments in other parts of europe will cause incredible problems for national politicians once the path out of the eu has been paved . 
  nobody wants to open that pandoras box . 
  that 's unlikely to happen though , as the majority of polling has been showing , the tories are unlikely to be in power after the elections . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmusv-7bmzm ) is the full speech , in english . 
  you can make up your mind on the full speech . 
  birmingham has more people , more universities , and a much larger economy . 
  take birmingham out and the impact on the uk is far larger than if you take out manchester . 
  manchester only really begins competing if it starts including the smaller independent cities around it , in a bid to catch up . 
  even then though , we would still be pulling ahead . 
  in fact [ birmingham ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3 ) and its surroundings is larger economically than edinburgh and glasgow combined . 
  combined . 
  not to say we dont have our own problems , we should really take a leaf out of manchester 's book and try to get more tourists and come out of the shadows a bit . 
  maybe get a rich arab to buy birmingham city or something . 
  on a side note , i really like manchester but i enjoy watching mancs struggle with being told their second best to birmingham .
