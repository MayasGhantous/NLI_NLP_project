   but in all honesty they 're not bilingual in particularly useful international languages i understand polish and somali because of the demographics but , arabic , urdu , punjabi , spanish ? 
  they are incredibly useful languages that hundreds of millions of people speak . 
  the economic rise of the subcontinent and of other countries like nigeria ( where many immigrants are from ) will be very helpful in building stronger trade and other ties in the future . 
  thanks , i actually wrote that and then changed because it seemed wrong for some reason . 
  i should have googled . 
  * to specifically help your citizens who are living , working or visiting the other eu country * to help business from the eu country export to your own , or your own business export to this eu country ( investment , trade etc ) * to spy on them ( hahaa ... ah ... ah ) not to forget , intra-eu diplomacy . 
  you send your ambassador to sound out the french about some new eu thing you are trying to propose . 
  then build the dialogue on from there . 
  also , diplomacy whether its top down or bottom up still has to have a practical level at the embassies . 
  there is more to it then ministers at the top having a chat . 
  [ lee ryan - the heavy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndsydtev-cy#t=246 ) gross : # 9,714 hilarious . 
  i 'm not terribly worried . 
  once it begins looking likely ( con win ) then you 'll see the city buy up every pr firm in london to keep the uk in . 
  with the two major parties united and the city spending money on it , i 'm pretty confident there wont be an exit . 
  they only really need to convince the wavering voters and that will be easy . 
  imagine a uncontested pr stance of `` leaving the eu means losing [ this many ] jobs '' non-stop . 
  i noticed it happens more outside of london than in london ( i 'm from the midlands ) . 
  pub prices are ridiculous in london . 
   very culturally british yep , this fact is sometimes forgotten when people talk about the xenophobia of the british press and why they wouldnt say the same to the black british population . 
  afro-caribbeans make up a large amount of black britain , and are culturally assimilated very easily . 
  they share the same language , religion , and by and large the same culture as the rest of the uk ( as well as mutual colonial history and sacrifice in british wars ) . 
  this cultural assimilation can be seen in the sheer amount of interracial relationships ( half of all black afro-caribbeans men and 1/3 of women are in interracial relationships ) that there are . 
  it 's not only seen as racist , but its very hard to even bring it up from a xenophobic standpoint for the press . 
  an interesting side about the interracial relationships is that there are so many that it is predicted that the afro-caribbean ethnic group ( and some others ) will almost [ virtually disappear ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jan/18/race-identity-britain-study ) . 
   hittites well nations identities do change , but they 've had museums since the early kemal period that was built to preserve their [ history ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/museum_of_anatolian_civilizations ) and [ culture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ankara_ethnography_museum ) . 
  a turkish citizen can probably clarify more but they do seem to still have a connection with it . 
  this is a common misconception . 
  the turkish population is people who have lived in anatolia for millennia who were culturally assimilated into the new turkish state . 
  this indigenous anatolian population are the primary source of the current turkish population . 
  what occurred is similar to a cultural assimilation rather than the wholesale emigration of the indigenous population and wholesale immigration of the turkic peoples of central asia . 
  [ source ] ( http://mesharpe.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,2,6;journal,9,198;linkingpublicationresults,1:110900,1 ) [ source ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.2011.00701.x/abstract;jsessionid=e2f92842027bc997f89bfd8ee2b31bdb.f04t04 ) [ source ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1287948/ ) [ source ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12596050 ) a similar misconception happens with egypt ( because of the arab usage ) , the indigenous population of ancient egypt is still the same source for the indigenous population of modern egypt . 
  it 's not hard mate . 
  go take a peek at subreddits like / r/morbidreality / r/syriancivilwar / r/combatfootage . 
  imagine the shocking things you see there put in montages aimed specifically at impressionable young men . 
  you first manipulate their empathy for the victims and turn that into anger . 
  then manipulate that anger towards your preferred target ( in this case , assad ) . 
  coat it with some religion to make it more legitimate and you are on your way to getting a recruit . 
  this is done time and time again and its only really understood how powerful it can be when you actually see the visceral and horrible footage that comes out of war . 
  all of this over the course of a year or so can make anyone willing to help people and die for their cause . 
  it is done generally by those want assad gone , but those who try to coerce muslims in europe to the resistance tend to be islamists . 
  because you are legitimate to question the judgement of a persons professional life if there is something so horrible in their private life . 
  not saying in this case it was , as frankly like i said before i dont really care either way but some people definitely did . 
  for example , adac who are the largest german association ( and european ) at the fia were adamant he had to go . 
  they stopped working with the [ fia until he was sacked ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7430939.stm ) . 
  that 's the only reason i mentioned german anger . 
  it seemed like some people were bothered and offended by it , that is something i understand . 
  they do this every couple of years . 
  especially with the uk . 
  the uk 's fco has be pretty much pro-palestinian for a couple of decades now . 
  much to israels dislike . 
  it was even joked about in yes minister . 
  it 's only been the uk 's political class that limits the fco . 
  britain made the most formal protests to israel about its actions than any other country ( [ back in 2005 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/26/israel.foreignpolicy ) ) . 
  it 's still probably quite high . 
  not to mention stuff like that fco diplomat who was sacked ( anti-semitism ) and fined ( anti-semitism ) for shouting `` fucking israelis , fucking jews '' at the gym while watching a report of farmers being killed by israeli bombs in gaza . 
  yea , it 's one of the pro-eu corners , another is london . 
  i get the feeling - and this may be completely off base - but the pro-eu stance comes from a need to have a counterweight to curb london . 
  without interference from london i wonder how long that stance will last ( if that was the main criteria for it ) especially if the eu starts being portrayed as limiting newly won scottish sovereignty . 
  yea , i didnt really care either way . 
  but as he was the head of a non-profit association that represents countries across the world , the revelations directly affected its image and credibility so they had every right to fire him . 
  i can see why the germans were angry as well , as they had every right to be . 
  absolutely fascinating . 
  the fco seemed to enjoy emphasising how many missions abroad we have and what scotland will lose from that . 
  going from 267 embassies/consulates down to less than 100 will be a blow , as well as trying to recreate the scope of the ukti . 
   its not like he went around telling people he 's a nazi . 
  he did n't cause alarm to other people , and just basically had sex with a few hookers in his private time . 
  to be fair , there was also another side to it . 
  his father was the most influential and famous english fascist politician ever , who was also quite close to the nazi 's . 
  it 's pretty much why everyone went even more & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; than usual . 
   the united kingdom belongs with canada , australia and new zealand more than it does with continental europe . 
  nah , we already turned our back on them in the 70 's . 
  no point turning the clock back now . 
  uk overseas territories in order of population . 
  ** bermuda ** ( caribbean ) : they had an independence referendum in 1995 that was beaten by 75 % . 
  the premier who was for independence then resigned . 
  the current parliament is made up of two parties and neither have independence on on their election platforms . 
  the [ plp ] ( http://plp.bm/ ) ( opposition ) and the [ one bermuda alliance ] ( http://www.oba.bm/ ) ( government ) . 
  ** status ** : unlikely ** cayman islands ** ( caribbean ) : they have not had an independence referendum . 
  current legislative parliament is made of two main parties the [ united democratic party ] ( http://www.udp.ky/ ) ( opposition ) and the [ people 's progressive movement ] ( http://www.theprogressives.ky/ ) ( government ) and two smaller parties ( coalition for cayman and people 's national alliance ) with 2 appointed members ( by the uk ) . 
  usually most members stood as independents but party politics was recently introduced ( 2000 ) , this lead to the formation of the pressure-advocacy group [ coalition for cayman ] ( http://www.coalitionforcayman.ky/about-us/ ) and the [ people 's national alliance ] ( http://www.compasscayman.com/chamber/2013/04/17/people%e2%80%99s-national-alliance--principled---pragmatic/ ) . 
  none of the parties discuss independence from the uk in their manifestos . 
  status : unlikely ** turks and caicos islands ** ( caribbean ) : ah , here we get tricky . 
  to understand t&c current political climate you have to understand the role of the governor . 
  he serves as the head of state representing the uk . 
  he is always a career diplomat from the uk 's foreign office . 
  he can impose direct rule and has a lot of power but its only on orders from the fco ( foreign and commonwealth office ) . 
  independence was going to be guaranteed if the independence supporting party got elected in 1982 . 
  they failed and from then on it faded from discussion . 
  it then got brought back when a man named michael misick , who was the premier at the time , stated independence as the `` ultimate '' goal . 
  around 2008 uk mp 's after routine review of t&c ( * cough * holiday * cough * ) received reports there was systematic corruption throughout the government there . 
  there was then a commission of enquiry which came to the same conclusion . 
  apparently the premier , the aforementioned michael misick , '' [ has been accused of building a multimillion-dollar fortune financed from questionable dealings that gave property developers access to crown-owned land ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/aug/14/turks-caicos-islands-corruption-allegations ) '' . 
  he is still on charges and was granted bail today ( bail was $ 12 million ! ) . 
  the uk then imposed direct rule in 2009 and began controlling the day to day runnings . 
  t&c elites were very against this . 
  direct rule lasted for about 3 years and there was an election in 2012 . 
  the two main parties are the [ people 's democratic movement ] ( http://votepdm.com/?page_id=16 ) ( government ) , they are the party that had the corrupt leader and the [ progressive national party ] ( https://www.facebook.com/pnptci ) - i could only find their official facebook page , their site is down - ( opposition ) . 
  the current government - who were ousted through direct rule - have stated they will seek out an independence referendum if they win ( this was 2011 ) . 
  they won but still havent introduced it . 
  the official opposition also see independence as a [ future goal ] ( https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/turks-and-caicos-informers/ugpahe0lhwe ) .
