  so the likelihood of a referendum on independence coming soon is high . 
  however both parties like to speak vaguely and talk about independence as a `` goal '' that has no deadline . 
  i dont know if the people support it or dont . 
  ** status ** : likely ** british virgin islands ** ( caribbean ) : they have not had an independence referendum before . 
  currently there are two parties in the house . 
  [ national democratic party ] ( http://bvindp.com/dparty/ ) ( government ) and [ virgin islands party ] ( http://virginislandsparty1971.com/ ) ( opposition ) , neither have independence on their agenda . 
  however the bvi is a financial tax haven and it is being attacked by the uk government ( and from everyone else as well ) about its financial service industry . 
  this has led to calls of independence in some quarters but nothing serious has taken hold . 
  ** status ** : unlikely ** anguilla ** ( caribbean ) : they didnt have an independence referendum , in fact they had a revolution ( twice ! ), 
  in the 60 's when the uk forced them to join in with st kitts and nevis as a single territory , this was resolved eventually ( troops and police from london ! ), 
  and they were split off . 
  when st kitts got independence in 1980 , anguilla didnt . 
  the parliament is made up three parties , with the anguilla united movement ( government ) having 4 seats and the other two parties having 3 . 
  there are 4 appointed members as well ( 3 by uk 1 by the ruling party ) . 
  the main party seems to support independence , in late 2013 the [ premier hubert hughes ] ( http://theanguillian.com/2013/04/cm-hughes-has-two-questions-for-anguillians-do-you-want-complete-internal-self-government-or-independence/ ) declared that they are looking into the possibility of a independence referendum quite soon , this was with a radio talk show so ... 
  in any case their manifesto doesnt seem to be up anymore . 
  i dont have more information on the oppositions independence views . 
  ** status ** : maybe -- now we are talking about places that have the combined population of my local neighbourhood . 
  -- ** saint helena , ascension and tristan da cunha ** ( atlantic ocean ) : three islands in the atlantic . 
  tristan da cunha , about 200 people live here . 
  it 's a small island . 
  it is known as the remotest island in the world . 
  ** status ** : unlikely if ever ascension : has about 800 people living here . 
  raf base is located here that is also used by the us . 
  ** status ** : unlikely if ever st-helena - largest of the 3 islands , has no political parties just independents . 
  gets lots of financial assistance from the uk . 
  ** status ** : unlikely if ever ** monteserrat ** ( caribbean ) - same as st helena except has political parties . 
  ** status ** : unlikely ** diego garcia ** ( indian ocean ) : military base , no settled population due to us being cunts . 
  ** status ** : unlikely if ever ** falklands , south gerogia and sandwich islands ** : [ hah ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuhkbagrrac ) . 
  ** pitcairn ** : 48 people . 
  most notable thing that has happened in centuries is a sexual assault case in 04 . 
  ** status ** : unlikely, 
  japan ? 
  really ? 
  they are currently going through prime ministers like a fat person at mcdonalds . 
  it 's been one a year since 07 . 
  hardly responsible governance ( and this is not even mentioning the mistakes made at fukushima ) . 
  you 're absolutely right kill_all_pakis , i 've changed my mind . 
   the majority were apparently women , many of whom had been victims of torture and human trafficking and who had been imprisoned in israel for a long time . 
  sweden agreed to take them in response to a special request by the un refugee agency ( unhcr ) and to include them in a resettlement plan , due to their special circumstances . 
  showing moral leadership in an immoral world . 
  okay . 
  in regards too ? 
  i think a lot of blame can be rest upon the feet of the dictatorship . 
  they sowed the seeds of instability and the resulting revolution in portugal meant that the new leaders could not reduce the issues that would arise in the resulting power vacuum from rapid decolonisation . 
  a slower process was required but by the 70 's it was already too late . 
  it has to do with cv because of the relations between bissau and cape verde at the time . 
  especially in regards to independence which at the time was seen by independence ( paigc ) movers as one nation . 
  and i 'm talking about the independence war in a wider sense , there were many cape verdeans in paigc fighting the portuguese even if every battle was not on the islands . 
  what does this have to do with skin ? 
  i 'm supporting their independence because they are independent . 
  they have the right to self-determination and they expressed that right after april 25 . 
  i dont know the situation in azores , madeira or canaries , but if they want independence they should have it . 
  there is a right to self-determination and the cape verdeans expressed that right . 
  the ones i know who are the ones who told me this stuff would be dead set against the idea . 
  it would be spitting on the legacy of cabral . 
   cape verde should 've been kept as autonomous and portuguese . 
  they have very little in common with the african mainland . 
  they fought a war for independence alongside other portuguese african territories , i dont think they wanted to stay with portugal . 
  especially after decades of neglect and atrocities like pidjiguiti . 
  i wouldnt say they have little in common , especially with places like guinea-bissau . 
  i would wager the dutch and swedish definitely . 
  nah no worries . 
   maybe it 's just me , but parts of what you wrote sound pretty racist that tends to happen around this subreddit . 
  sure , i went on erasmus to sweden and i had a wonderful time . 
  the eu also covered my tuition fee expense for that year as well as giving me a grant . 
  being from uk that meant they covered a 3 grand tuition fee , which is quite a lot . 
  it has also meant i ended up interacting and befriending people who were also on erasmus from across the eu , learning new cultures and new swear words . 
  it was incredibly valuable experience to me ( although not my liver ) and one that i will always cherish . 
  the ease of travel is quite self-explanatory . 
  i travel across europe to meet friends and have a very easy time of it . 
  it 's an incredibly simple and straightforward to go from london to lisbon or anywhere else in the eu . 
  erasmus and ease of travel . 
  the endless tirade wo n't end for the next couple of years . 
  every wave of immigrants had to go through it , the earlier ones had it really rough ( commonwealth immigrants ) this is really tame by comparison . 
  just strap in and enjoy the ride , it will soon be over and they will move on to something else . 
  ahh my apologies , grammar fail . 
  i was pointing out that they * dont * use their militaries equipment to fund external actors , which we seem to agree on . 
  i should work on my sentence structure . 
  i think the us already has significant export controls on oil . 
  the oil companies are lobbying hard to repeal those laws and begin exporting way more . 
  but , i wasnt insisting that the us would be harmed more severely than others , they have learned their lessons from the last embargo , but any coordinated impact on the global market by opec would definitely harm prices in the us regardless of the reserve . 
  i was simply explaining why they couldnt overtake the saudi 's current position as the swing producers and keep market prices stable . 
  do n't worry , they 're using english . 
  we already won . 
  the uk-saudi arms deal ? 
  are you saying they are supplying terrorists with jet fighters ? 
  incredibly unlikely that they would try to upset the market . 
  oil market stability is as important to them as it is to everyone else in the world . 
  even in simple practical terms . 
  with growth in china slowing , other developing economies slowing as well ( brazil , india etc ) , europe still not growing at any decent rate and the usa only just turning the corner , any major instability in the market will cause all of that to come crashing down . 
  high oil prices sound good for them but in reality they realise it is not because it will lead to future sales being lower as well as something called [ demand destruction ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demand_destruction ) . 
  it will facilitate a concerted push to move away from oil which is unhelpful to the saudi 's to say the least . 
  they dont want any of this and are already important stakeholders in the global economy . 
  sudden upheavals in the market will also negatively affect the country internally and may cause issues for the royal family legitimacy . 
  doing that would be the `` nuclear '' option and its not something they would seriously consider over syria ( maybe iran if it really is seen as worth it ) . 
  it is much easier to fuck over the us military industrial complex and sign major deals with other nations to give the us a reminder . 
  they have already done similar things before like the al-yamamah arms deal with the uk . 
  you can give yourself all the new oil , and become your own biggest supplier , but you can not keep prices stable . 
  the only reliable controllers of a stable market are still opec .
