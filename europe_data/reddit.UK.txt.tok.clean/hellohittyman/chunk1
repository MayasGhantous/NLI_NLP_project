has nothing to do with british imperialism . 
  has everything to do with the roman name for the collection of islands from 2000 years ago . 
  google is your friend . 
  uk went to war before bombs were ever dropped on london . 
  there is no irony . 
  if people support the murdering of innocent people they do n't belong in the western world . 
  if it were up to me i would have them executed , but i know public opinion would never sway that way . 
  we need to destroy this ideology with force and strength , not cowardice and accomodation . 
  be ready to respond with lethal force to a large scale terrorist attack . 
  it was to stop nazism . 
  germany have a bigger economy but are absolutely not more powerful than the uk . 
  the uk would destory germany in a war with ease . 
  anyway over the course of our lifetime the uk is set to leapfrog germany 's economy and build a huge economic lead on them , to add to the already huge military and diplomatic lead the uk has . 
  i think we know the uk will remain on top as we always do , 
  yes , if they believe it is right to murder innocent people in the name of their god they should absolutly be deported . 
  the british government could easily get those nations to agree . 
  money is power and britain has money . 
  either offer them more money or threaten to withdraw foreign aid , that is not a problem . 
  it was a joint effort . 
  but britain was the only one who fought valiantly from start to finish . 
  britain won both those wars, 
  britain won both those wars, 
  i have confidence in the british police and army . 
  we have the best forces in the world and i 'm sure they will keep us safe . 
  uk out campaign leading is small news now ? 
  brexit could spell the end of the eu overall , it 's huge news . 
  so boring you clicked on it and posted a comment . 
  what do you mean legal recognition of the term ? 
  it is an official geographic term that is used all the time . 
  just like other geographic terms like europe or north america . 
  but used by everyone else . 
  ireland is not prominent enough to dispute anything . 
  when was europe called that ? 
  * ` the islands were called the british isles because we owned ireland for a very long time ' * no they were were n't . 
  the term british isles has its roots over 2000 years ago when greek/roman writing described the collection of islands as the brettanic islands . 
  the term has its roots 2000 years ago when the collection of islands were named the bretttanic islands . 
  i think this is the first time i have ever agreed with you, 
  i doubt the uk will leave to be completly honest . 
  does n't matter if a few irish nationalists are anoyed by it , they ca n't change facts . 
  * downvotes for the truth *, 
  yes britain does . 
  but the british isles refers to the collection of islands , including ireland . 
  he 's from northern ireland . 
  he is northern irish . 
  does n't matter whether you try to claim him or not , you ca n't change facts . 
  they do ? 
  is crossrail not opening very soon ? 
  with the rest in construction/planning ? 
  * before lots of butthurt irish comment * british isles is the term used to refer to both britain and ireland ( plus all the other smaller islands ) . 
  this is a geographic term and not a political one . 
  what point are you trying to make ? 
  the collection of islands are known as the british isles . 
  this is geographic term and not a political one . 
  yeah , in the very short term it undoubtly will . 
  in the long term no one knows though . 
  leaving the eu could be a bad move , or it could be a terrific economic move . 
  the governments are doing stuff to try and fix this . 
  but at the end of the day our population is growing rapidly and people all over the world/eu are desperate to come and live here . 
  meaning demand is and always will be severe . 
  it 's the unfortunate downside of living in an extremely successful and highly attractive country to live and work in . 
  * why the downvotes ? 
  i am only speaking the truth *, 
  the uk will not drop into economic free fall if we vote out of a political union . 
  that can only be a good thing . 
  right wing nationalist parties rarely gain real political power , but what they do do is drag the political paradigm further to the right , which will result in the mainstream politicians taking a harder stance on issues around immigration and terrorism . 
  which is exactly what we need . 
  yeah , but the huge amount of muslims merkel has invited into the continent is only going to result in many more homegrown terrorists for future generations to deal with . 
  an eu army would not work . 
  an eu army would effectively mean uk + france + everyone else . 
  you wo n't convince the brits or french to go along with it as it will result in them losing huge amounts of power and influence . 
  completley unrelated . 
  france has never been a superpower and it never will be . 
  defense accounts for 17 % of their government 's entire budget . 
  nearly on a level with both health/human services & social security spending . 
  it spends more on defense than it does on education , personal management , transportation , agriculture and labour combined . 
  you ca n't honestly believe that this is normal ? 
  they do n't have a unified healthcare system , they have crippling poverty for the first world , they have extreme wealth inequality , they have huge communities with absurdly high crime rates and rampant unemployment , they have black people rioting in the streets regularly etc. 
  they spend not far off a quarter of their budget on bombs & guns whilst suffering with all of these problems at home . 
  this results in a huge military which all of nato benefits from . 
  i do n't see how you can possibly argue anything other than the american citizens are clearly the worst off from this situation , whereas the europeans benefit . 
  not trolling . 
  at no point in history has france been a superpower . 
  why is that silly ? 
  it 's fairly obvious the us does n't look after it 's citizens in the way it should whilst spending huge amounts on defense . 
  * ` we 're no longer a super power ' * france was once a superpower !?!?!?!!?!?? 
  trump is a businessman and he sees nato for what it is , a terrible deal for the us . 
  they spend huge amounts of money on defense and supply next to nothing for their citizens . 
  whereas europe caters to their citizens and spends less on defense , knowing the us will pick up the tab . 
  i 'm just suprised it has gone on this long without american citizens demanding better for themselves . 
  france is weak, 
  woa calm down man it 's just a flag !, 
  only the best darn flag around though of course  you jealous your country 's flag is simply not up to par ?

  but put together it looks terrific . 
  that 's why the union jack is so ubiquitous in fashion/popular culture , more so than any other flag .
