he was . 
  also , he has more videos . 
  one of them is about [ oxtail soup ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwujkhptwt0&amp;channel=nickylyons ) . 
  i watch this competition on telly every year around boxing day . 
  it is n't something people ever talk about , but most people are aware of it . 
  we usually have a few in the finals , with terry hollands being the most notable competitor . 
  i do n't know if you like grammar corrections , but what you should have typed is `` this has existed '' and `` has n't it ? 
  as much as i like south park , the affect that that particular episode had on people with ginger hair was probably very negative . 
  i witnessed it first-hand in college . 
  i live in north-west england . 
  there were about 5 people in my year at high school ( 3 male , 2 female ) with ginger hair . 
  oh yeah , i did about the spanish armada and the war of the roses at some point . 
  maybe the industrial revolution , but i 'm not sure . 
  i did n't have a ruler , so i did a manual `` straight '' line . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dqefgx7.jpg ) is the first time i 've written with a pen and not a pencil in a long time . 
  ancient egypt romans anglo-saxons , celts and normans william the conquerer vs harold ii in the battle of hastings vikings the black death tudors with an emphasis on henry viii ww1 & ww2 might be a few things missing , but this is basically it and pretty much in the right order . 
  oh yeah , ninja warrior . 
  i used to watch this every saturday or sunday . 
  it was on after takeshi 's castle , commentated by craig charles . 
  no one ever won lol . 
  d'oh , i know that . 
  i rarely find use for the german i know , so i make a lot of stupid mistakes . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  would n't it be `` dem gott '' in this situation ? 
  my german is n't the best . 
  they generally prefer rugby . 
  i think the most messed up thing is that they feel they have to do this in the first place . 
  [ arriva bus ] ( http://dartslf.com/archives/archivesite/website8/blog%20_%20merseyside%20dennis%20dart%20website_files/58534519.jpg ) in southport , england . 
  i think they have these in most of the country though . 
  good luck !, 
  it 's actually been sunny here for about 2 weeks , with only 1 day of rain . 
  i do n't like it when it 's too hot though . 
  i 'm definitely a fan of the cold , or more like not a fan of the heat , and although i ca n't speak any of the nordic languages , i do like some songs sung in them . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zwryhwdpwi ) is probably my favourite at the moment . 
  i 'll admit , i 've had it on repeat for the last week . 
  but , but i have blue eyes . 
  can i join northern europe ? 
  ok , maybe not the cheapest tea ( i do n't drink tea too often , i usually stick to water ) , but i definitely do n't care when you put the milk in . 
  i do n't think people actually think scottish people are english , i think it 's more to do with the fact that they confuse the words : uk , britain and england . 
  even my mum calls the uk england sometimes , i always correct her though . 
  i know !, 
  i was watching a learn german video yesterday , and on the programme they came to england . 
  they went into a cafe and the waitress listed about 10 types of tea . 
  until i saw that i did n't realise that was part of the stereotype . 
  at home , i buy boxes of the cheapest teabags there are , as i ca n't even tell the difference . 
  they did , however , mention that we have chips with everything . 
  that is correct , as is the fact that a lot of people like tea . 
  in the uk , spain got 5 points . 
  this was most likely because ruth lorenzo was 5th on the x factor here in 2008 . 
  i blame the fact that we do n't win on graham norton , because he says every year `` do n't vote for the uk '' . 
  lol, 
  not historically , but i think the american opinion always has an influence . 
  people have brought this up so many times , however , no one gives a damn about the empire . 
  not once in my life have i ever heard someone mention the empire , except on history programmes . 
  we do n't even get taught about it at school ( at least i did n't ) . 
  the average person probably does n't even know about it . 
  * i 'm a czech at heart * my closest soulmates are in slovenia , portugal * i 'm farthest from luxembourg , sweden, 
  thanks . 
  it was the `` no ' '' that got me confused . 
  i 'm not used to that pronunciation . 
  i also do n't pronounce the `` t '' on the end , but not like the word `` no '' . 
  wow , that is tricky , though i can just about understand them . 
  however , i do n't understand what she 's saying at 21-25 seconds , it 's like `` when you 're knowing you 're terry , you 're wee bubbling and greeting '' . 
  i 'd be really interested to know what she 's actually saying there . 
  i 've yet to hear a british accent that i ca n't understand , though i have n't really travelled much . 
  i 've definitely never heard an english accent that i could n't understand . 
  another perspective - norman smith chief political correspondent , bbc news channel tweets : labour voters split over #lbcdebate . 
  51 % think nick clegg won . 
  42 % think nigel farage won i missed it though and only saw the highlights . 
  an englishman here , which is probably not what you wanted to see . 
  i had battered fish , chips and beans ( and heinz tomato ketchup , or red sauce as i call it ) . 
  fairly similar to you . 
  i think i 'm going to buy some hp sauce ; i have n't had it in years . 
  i have no picture because i 've already eaten it . 
  i 've only watched rt a few times , however to me this is n't that surprising . 
  she seems really passionate about what she does and appears to say how she really feels about matters . 
  some people in this thread have mentioned that this might be faux criticism , but based on what i 've seen of her in the past , i do n't think it is . 
  the plot of inspector morse the other week involved a murder in denmark . 
  when one is done in response to the other , therefore this is the former . 
  well , in the uk we have more `` u `` s in our words like colour instead of color , pronunciation differences for words such as tomato and banana , and generally just a different choice of words in everyday speech , for example , football and soccer , trolley and shopping cart , bin and trash can . 
  aside from these minor differences and some others , it 's pretty much the same . 
  i honestly do n't really regret not listening because what we were taught in schools were just sentences . 
  i learnt nothing about why you were saying these words and what they meant , just that they are the words that create the phrase . 
  in two years of french i learnt a-z , 1-59 and `` my name is chris . 
  i have blond hair and blue eyes '' . 
  i have recently took up german in my free time and learnt more german in one day than i did in a year of learning german , where i learnt 1-20 , brother and sister . 
  it 's taught in a really poor way in my opinion . 
  there is also the word `` scally '' , though that might be a regional thing . 
  it 's like a game of chinese whispers . 
  lol . 
  you know what i mean , 
  the fact that the `` and '' is capitalised changes its meaning . 
  it makes it appear that 25 % are some sort of child-women . 
  without the capitalisation it would be fine . 
  in scotland they actually sort of use a form of `` ej '' when they say `` cannae '' , which means `` cannot/can ` t '' . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's related , but it seems too much of a coincidence not to be . 
  i know what you mean , but this is in a professional environment . 
  it feels a bit different to me . 
  i personally have n't been asked by a homeless person for money . 
  if i were to be asked ( i never carry money anyway ) , i probably would n't give them any , but i would n't pick and choose based on their social status .
