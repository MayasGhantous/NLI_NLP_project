no your rebate on our rebate . 
  swiped from / u/ggow \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 the general procedure when it comes to the budget , the first thing that happens is they define how much to spend , negotiated amongst the europarliament , eurocommission , and the council of ministers . 
  the revenue for that is then raised in a number of ways , and primarily from three sources ( with the other around 1 % coming from fines , interest on late payments , tax on eu staff and so on ) . 
  the first source is what are known as ` traditional own resources ' . 
  as you may be aware , the eu is , amongst other things , a customs union . 
  the import duties , levies and tariffs are thus paid at one point for brining products in to the area . 
  those all go to fund the eu . 
  the second source is what is known as a ` vat call ' . 
  in essence , most countries pay 0.3 % of their vat tax take to the eu in order to pay for the eu 's activities . 
  ( this is one of the main reasons why the eu has harmonised vat law ( read : there are very strict rules on what is taxed for vat , what the rates of vat can be , and what exemptions can exist ) . 
  the third source is a contribution based on each member state 's gni . 
  the value raised from all of the other sources are summed and subtracted from the amount identified as being required in the budget negotiations . 
  that difference is then raised by allocating a fee to each state based on their relative share of the eu 's total gni . 
  for example , if member state a has a gni share of 10 % of the eu 's gni , they must pay 10 % of the identified shortfall . 
  ( you may remember that the uk had to pay more money to the eu recently due to our gdp being revised up with the inclusion of prostitution etc. 
  it is this part of the budget process that caused that to be necessary . ), 
  \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 the rebates once the above general procedure has been applied , there are correcting procedures put in place . 
  as you 'll be aware , the uk enjoys a rebate on what it pays into the eu budget . 
  in simple terms , this is roughly 2/3ds of what the net contribution would be . 
  the effect here , on the other member states , is to increase their contributions to the eu . 
  this is , in the first instance , calculated on the gni-based method mentioned above i.e. 
  member state a would need to pay 10 % of the rebate to the uk . 
  sweden , austria , germany , netherlands enjoy a ` rebate on the rebate ' . 
  in essence , their contribution is calculated , but they then only have to pay 25 % of it . 
  the difference is redistributed around the other member states on the same gni-share basis . 
  these four countries also enjoy a reduction on their vat call . 
  as mentioned , member states usually have to pay 0.3 % of their vat take to the eu . 
  sweden , and the netherlands only pay 0.1 % , germany pays 0.15 % and austria 0.225 % . 
  ( the difference , of course , being made up in the usual gni-share way ) . 
  the netherlands and sweden enjoy a lump sum rebate on their gni-based contributions . 
  once the sum has been calculated , the agreed rebate is subtracted , and then the shortfall for the budget made up in the usual way . 
  \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 tl ; dr \u2022 once the uk 's rebate is calculated , each memberstate is expected to contribute to it in proportion to their means . 
  the four countries above need only pay a quarter of that , with the burden then falling on the other memberstates to make up . 
  \u2022 each member state is expected to pay 0.3 % of their total vat take to the eu . 
  the four countries only pay a reduced fraction ( listed above ) . 
  \u2022 netherlands and sweden enjoy a discount on the portion of the budget that is calculated based on their relative means . 
  you are either hypersensitive or read a different thread to me . 
  germany gets a rebate on the rebate . 
  it 's mainly paid by france and italy . 
  / r/polandball, 
   yeah , sure . 
  like it alliances helped the first go around . 
  it may be cause i have just woken up but i am not quite sure what you are trying to say here . 
  no it 's because of nato and nukes . 
  because montserrats ( pop . 
  4,900 ) vote is equal to indias ( pop . 
  1.25 bil ) vote . 
  i 'm not even sure why this would require a treaty change . 
  ca n't the uk just slap a residency requirement onto tax credits ? 
  that is how all the other eu countries achieve effective discrimination . 
  in work benefits seem to be the sticking point . 
  i 'm voting to stay whatever but it 's the free movement of workers that 's the principle not fucking tax credits . 
  poland - ?? 
  way ahead of you france . 
  they can send round bailiffs to take your tv but for domestic customers the water keeps flowing . 
  yes they obviously do n't care about corruption as much . 
  also it 's european money that keeps the whole thing afloat so i doubt it . 
  drone strike ? 
  it 's not very accurate . 
  at least for my time to london . 
  all of this is because a lot of polish people see poland as a lost cause and buggered off over here at the first opportunity . 
  rolling power blackouts . 
  they cause baby booms . 
  sorry i have no idea .

   first up are dutch prime minister mark rutte and french president francois hollande , followed by polish prime minister ewa kopa and german chancellor angela merkel . 
  mr cameron has called for changes to eu migrants ' welfare entitlement , while some conservatives also want the primacy of british law to be reaffirmed . 
  4,670 kg - pathetic . 
   fifa president sepp blatter , who is not among them , issued a statement vowing to kick out corrupt officials . 
  take some fucking responsibility sepp . 
  even if you did n't take a cheque ( which i doubt ) the responsibility stops with you . 
  merkel and hollandes peacefire looks as good as [ chamberlain piece of paper ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/books/pix/pictures/2008/08/22/chamberlain460.jpg ) now . 
   secondly , should a us company , or individuals of that company , be immune to prosecution if they carry out crimes in , say , switzerland , but are part of a us company ?

  sorry they are quite well known but some people never make it further than london . 
  they both had their faults but keeping up strong diplomatic , military and cultural pressure to free half a continent is n't one of them . 
  more of a squiggly line .
