  russia 's historical legacy should be seen in the course of centuries , spanning all disciplines . 
  a grand history where it took them 500 to 100 years longer than everyone else in europe to get rid of serfdom and even then that process was mired in corruption and idiocy ? 
  or the fact that it took until 2013 for the russian military to finally completely move over to giving all their soldiers [ socks ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/jan/16/russian-soldiers-replacing-foot-wraps-socks ) . 
  the population living in poverty in russia has increased by a 20 % increase year-on-year , with an average 16.1 million people living below the poverty threshold in 2014 . 
  an average of 19.2 million russians -- or 13.4 % of the population -- were living last year on less than 9,452 roubles ( $ 139 ) a month , the minimum subsistence level determined by the russian government in the fourth quarter . 
  throw in more russians than ever emigrating , the slow/practically non-existant population growth ... yep ... russia really is a successful nation . 
  so they managed to fuck up two countries by throwing soldiers at it . 
  erm , yeah , anyone can do that . 
  yay !, 
  so successful !, 
  / s russia is a failure . 
  they went from being a repressive and brutal world power to an ambitious regional power with delusions of adequacy . 
  they need to learn their place in the world . 
  their acting up is just that juvenile tantrums . 
  the only threat they are capable of militarily is nuclear . 
  what is there to admire from them ? 
  their military is a joke , their economy is not even a consideration , they have some natural resources and thats about it . 
  culturally ? 
  oh joy of joys they had some good writers a couple of hundred years ago and wrote a couple of good books about vampires . 
  musically ? 
  why should i even deign to pretend to give a fuck about a culture that is so big on machismo and short on dick ? 
  on their best days they 're crass , on their worst days they 're crass bullies in knock off adidas tracksuits . 
  so you think we need to play nice and pretend to admire some butthurt little fucks to make them feel important ? 
  no , not interested , the peasants need to learn their place in the world . 
  stop causing problems and just shut the fuck up . 
  i really do hold the current shape of russia and it 's government/culture/etc etc in utter contempt . 
  i do n't even hate the russians , it 's just exasperation that i feel at them for not accepting their place in history . 
  i mean as a brit i 'm proud of past historical achievements but freely acknowledge we did a hell of a lot of really messed up stuff in the past and realise we are at best a major bit player on the world stage dwarfed by the us and china geopolitically now . 
  russia/russian politicians/russian fanboys it seems to me ca n't quite ever seem to get over the giant historical chip on their shoulder of being almost a contender on the world stage . 
  i mean if we look at the historical achievements and geopolitical placements of russia and the soviet union then they never ever managed to be a real threat and always managed to end up in a worse position after trying to challenge the dominant power of the time . 
  see vs british empire and then the fall of the soviet union . 
  it 's like they manage to crawl up to 2nd place and then try to challenge the top dog and then fail so spectacularly they drop down to the amateur leagues again . 
  fantastic , now is there anything in this millennium ? 
  history ? 
  the links are there ... also i play world of warships and enjoy taunting the russians who play it and believe in russia stronk by listing all their naval failures and point out why they should n't exist in the game . 
  at all . 
  they get really angry and then die quickly , quite entertaining . 
  a single bad battle ? 
  these idiots sailed from the baltic sea to the sea of japan . 
  some parts of the fleet did it the long way round too !, 
  http://i.imgur.com/33pgvia.png it was n't a single bad battle it was one series of completely unmitigated disasters after another capped off by a disastrously bad battle . 
  did you read it ? 
  they kept on fucking up by shooting at themselves . 
  *** again and again and again and again . 
  *** or for more modern fun ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_cork_oil_spill https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_communications_ship_ssv-33 for a funnier telling of the story about the ural see https://medium.com/war-is-boring/russias-giant-secret-spy-ship-killed-rats-ruined-careers-and-almost-got-blown-up-twice-69282ecbca00 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/880220.stm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/severomorsk_disaster http://warisboring.com/russias-navy-is-more-rust-than-ready/ the russian navy is dangerous yes , but by accident , not by design . 
  my favourite bit of pre-1917 russian history is the russo-japanese war and especially the [ dogger bank incident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dogger_bank_incident ) where sailors from the russian baltic fleet , sailing through the north sea to get to japan , mistook a british fishing trawler fleet for ijn torpedo boats . 
  and to quote  because of the fleet 's alleged sightings of balloons and four enemy cruisers the day previously , coupled with *** `` the possibility that the japanese might surreptitiously have sent ships around the world to attack '' *** them , the russian admiral , zinovy rozhestvensky , called for increased vigilance , issuing an order that `` no vessel of any sort must be allowed to get in among the fleet '' , and to prepare to open fire upon any vessels failing to identify themselves . 
  with ample reports about the presence of japanese torpedo boats , submarines and minefields in the north sea , and the general nervousness of the russian sailors , *** 48 harmless fishing vessels were attacked by the russians , thousands of miles away from enemy waters . 
  *** but it [ gets so so so much better ] ( http://www.hullwebs.co.uk/content/l-20c/disaster/dogger-bank/voyage-of-dammed.htm )  the state of affairs was so bad that one officer on the battleship `` kniaz suvoroff '' said of his gunnery crews that `` one half have to be taught everything because they know nothing ; the other half because they have forgotten everything ; but if they do remember anything then it is obsolete '' . 
  to compound the problem it would later emerge that some of the ratings were members of various revolutionary groups who tried to stir up unrest among the crews . 
   in addition , rozhestvensky was also dissatisfied with his senior officers . 
  he referred to his obese second-in-command rear-admiral folkersham as `` a manure sack '' and described the cruiser commander rear-admiral enkvist as `` a vast empty space '' . 
  there 's also the specific incident before dogger bank ...  when two fishermen delivering consular dispatches from the tsar approached the fleet , the russians opened fire . 
  ironically , the two men , who were thankfully unharmed due to the appalling standards of russian gunnery , had a personal message for rozhestvensky from tsar nicholas informing him that he had now been promoted to vice-admiral . 
   for good measure the fleet repair ship `` kamchatka '' signaled that she was under attack by torpedo boats . 
  when asked how many she replied `` about eight from all directions '' . 
  this was a false alarm . 
  the antics of the captain and crew of the `` kamchatka '' would be the cause of several incidents of an increasingly farcical nature later in the expedition . 
  then at dogger bank ...  having survived attacks from phantom japanese torpedo boats and submarines and having negotiated a non-existent minefield , the squadron sailed into the north sea where the russians spotted the hull trawler fleet fishing on the dogger bank . 
  the russians identified the innocent trawlers as being yet more japanese torpedo boats and opened fire - an incident which almost caused war between russia and britain . 
   in the ensuing pandemonium several russian ships signaled that torpedoes had hit them . 
  on the battleship `` borodino '' , some of the crew donned life belts and lay prone on the deck while others charged around wielding cutlasses shouting that the ship was being boarded by the japanese and thus panicked the fleet even more . 
   the russian battleships continued firing , damaging four british trawlers and sinking one . 
  for good measure they also managed to hit two of their own cruisers the `` avrora '' and the `` donskoy '' which had been subject to a bombardment from seven russian battleships sailing in line-ahead formation . 
   the following morning revealed a night of madness caused by mass hysteria amongst the russians . 
  fortunately for the british trawlers ( and the two russian cruisers ) russian gunnery was so bad that damage had been kept to a minimum . 
  for example , the battleship `` oroyol '' had fired over 500 shells without hitting a thing . 
  500 shells ... ahahahahahaha but it just does n't stop !, 
  when the baltic fleet reaches tangier ...  the main fleet then approached tangier having lost contact with the `` kamchatka '' for some days . 
  the `` kamchatka '' eventually rejoined the fleet reporting that she had fired 300 shells in an engagement with three japanese ships - the enemy vessels were actually a swedish merchantman , a german trawler and a french schooner . 
  for good measure as the fleet left tangier one ship managed to cut the city 's underwater telegraph cable with her anchor which prevented communication with europe for four days . 
  there are no words really ... oh wait there are actually . 
  lots of them . 
   having been quiet for some days , the `` kamchatka '' sent a new wave of panic throughout the fleet when she sent the wrong signal during a storm off the coast of angola . 
  instead of issuing the code `` we are all right now '' the message `` do you see torpedo boats '' was signaled . 
   as the fleet neared cape town , rozhestvensky received a signal that klado was sending the reinforcements to join him . 
  the admiral knowing the quality of the ships decided to avoid a rendezvous with them . 
  morale amongst the fleet reached an all time low as many of the sailors became convinced that they were sailing to certain destruction . 
   to lift their spirits , the crews collected exotic pets on shore visits - including a crocodile and a poisonous snake that caused a panic on one battleship when it wrapped itself around the guns and then bit the commanding officer . 
  *** the fleet turned into a floating zoo as a bizarre menagerie of birds and animals was left free to roam the decks . 
  events took a more severe downturn when the cooling plant on the `` esperance '' , the fleet 's refrigerated supply ship , broke down . 
  a lot of rotting meat had to be jettisoned which resulted in the fleet being followed by sharks . 
  *** lol but it gets better . 
   at madagascar , events took a turn for the worse . 
  for two weeks , admiral rozhestvensky was severely ill and remained confined in his cabin . 
  his chief of staff suffered a brain haemorrhage and was partially paralysed . 
  no one was really in command of the fleet and the crews spent increasing amounts of time ashore at various saloons , brothels and gambling houses . 
  disease broke out with daily deaths from malaria , dysentery and typhoid . 
  during the funeral for one of her dead , the `` kamchatka '' fired a salute . 
  unfortunately a live shell was used which hit the cruiser `` aurora '' which was by now becoming used to being a mobile target for russian gunnery . 
   mental illness from the long period at sea began to take a toll on the crews as religious fervour broke out . 
  the worst cases together with a group of mutineers and revolutionaries from the `` admiral nakhimov '' were sent back to russia on the supply ship `` malay '' . 
  many officers were frequently drunk or drugged . 
  one officer had bought 2,000 cigarettes in madagascar , which were found to be filled with opium . 
   the fleet also needed to be re-supplied with ammunition having fired most of its shells in the `` battle '' with the british trawlers . 
  spirits lifted when the supply ship `` irtysh '' arrived . 
  the `` irtysh '' was expected to be carrying ammunition for the fleet . 
  *** when the cargo was unloaded it was found to comprise 12,000 pairs of fur-lined boots and a matching number of winter coats - ideally suited to equatorial africa where the fleet was now stationed !, 
  *** useful !, 
   to try and restore some semblance of order and battle readiness , rozhestvensky ordered gunnery practice .
