  how much of those funds could have been used to service debt and pay for social programs for the elderly or military projects . 
  instead the middle classes just stole it from the nation . 
  tax remittance levels means how many of the citizens do n't try to fuck with taxes . 
  so explain again how being a border state dramatically changes how much tax people are paying to the state . 
  hint : the answer is none . 
  let us look to israel shall we ? 
  a country like greece surrounded by enemies as you so quaintly put it . 
  http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-02-24/what-greece-can-learn-from-israel-about-tax-cheats  after the initial security threats subsided , israelis began evading taxes en masse . 
  one estimate from 1953 suggested that of 560,000 potential taxpayers , only 300,000 -- or a little more than half -- had registered with the israeli revenue . 
  a separate report in 1956 estimated that 90 percent of employees paid their taxes , but only half the self-employed labor force did . 
   israel at the time was flooded with refugees . 
  most immigrants , as an american adviser warned , `` brought with them a deeply ingrained attitude to the effect that ` the government is our enemy . '''  the government responded in a rather arbitrary and coercive fashion , selectively intimidating specific classes of taxpayers . 
  things went from bad to worse in 1954 , after a prominent confectioner , israel sinai , committed suicide and left behind a note blaming the income tax for his death . 
  israelis went on a tax strike that year , prompting the government to form a commission to study the issue . 
   by avoiding single-minded , heavy-handed interventions ( as countries such as argentina did , unsuccessfully ) israel fixed its problem . 
  by the 1970s , tax evasion had largely disappeared , and israel became an adviser to other countries struggling to collect taxes from their recalcitrant citizenry . 
  i mean if the average greek citizen paid off their taxes then the debt would n't be an issue , i mean a few years ago there was an [ article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/world/europe/02evasion.html?pagewanted=all ) where it said almost no one in greece said they earned more than $ 132,000 ( this was converted to dollars because of the article being in the nyt ) ... lol  the cheating is often quite bold . 
  when tax authorities recently surveyed the returns of 150 doctors with offices in the trendy athens neighborhood of kolonaki , where prada and chanel stores can be found , more than half had claimed an income of less than $ 40,000 . 
  thirty-four of them claimed less than $ 13,300 , a figure that exempted them from paying any taxes at all . 
   such incomes defy belief , said ilias plaskovitis , the general secretary of the finance ministry , who has been in charge of revamping the country 's tax laws . 
  `` you need more than that to pay your rent in that neighborhood , '' he said . 
   he said there were only a few thousand citizens in this country of 11 million who last year declared an income of more than $ 132,000 . 
  yet signs of wealth abound .

  see that table ? 
  it 's an estimate of how many greeks per sector are fucking with their taxes and by how much ... 
  so taking those numbers as a given , greece according to world bank data has around 6 doctors per 1,000 people , so taking 11,000,000 as the population and the 75 % and 30k figure they 're dodging taxes by i get 1,138,500,000 that 's 1.1 bn right there and change . 
  i 'm ignoring science and engineering because , well i would n't even know how to get that number ... education , i think i 'm wildly underestimating here i 'm just going with [ world bank data ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/pupil-teacher-ratio-primary-wb-data.html ) again ... 123,793 primary and secondary teachers , not counting university lecturers and private tutors and etc ok ? 
  24k average at a percentage of 73 % evasion ... 
  the numbers are ... 2,168,853,360 thats 2.1 bn and change ... 
  seriously . 
  just from two professions/economic sectors i 've pulled out a back of a napkin calculation that you could argue against i agree number of three fucking billion of taxes being dodged . 
  would the current crisis even exist if tax remittance levels were even remotely normal ? 
  that study by researchers from the university of chicago concluded that tax evasion in 2009 by self-employed professionals alone in greece ( accountants , dentists , lawyers , doctors , personal tutors and independent financial advisers ) was $ 28 billion or 31 % of the budget deficit that year . 
  $ 28 billion . 
  $ 28 billion . 
  so going from the 2009 numbers , of the $ 220 billion owed ... 28/220 that 's 12.7 % of the debt . 
  at the start of the year with the coming in of syriza people were quoted as saying `` oh i 'm going to stop paying taxes , syriza will forgive us . 
  they 'll understand '' this was n't business magnates or oligarchs but it was a bloody dentist and she had a tax bill of $ 20k !!!, 
  i do n't see what being a border state does for tax remittance levels . 
  from the [ ft ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b47c6d76-a320-11e4-bbef-00144feab7de.html ) on january 23 , 2015 6:59 pm  a reluctance to pay taxes was much criticised by greece 's creditors as one reason why the country needed a big international bailout . 
  now many greeks are again avoiding the taxman as they bet the radical left syriza party will quickly loosen fiscal policy if it comes to power in sunday 's general election . 
   however , two private sector economists forecast the shortfall could exceed $ 1.5 bn , or more than 40 per cent of projected revenues for january . 
   angeliki mousouri , a dentist who is paying off more than $ 20,000 of tax arrears , said she missed a monthly instalment due in december . 
   `` i do n't expect to be penalised , '' she said . 
  `` if syriza is the government they will show leniency to cash-strapped taxpayers . '' how about the [ economist ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21643195-can-greeces-new-government-satisfy-voters-and-compromise-its ) on february 14th 2015 ? 
   alexis tsipras and his radical left syriza party worked for more than a year while in opposition to prepare their policy platform . 
  over 80 committees were charged with producing specific proposals for overhauling different sectors of the greek economy . 
  planning for power is one thing ; exercising it quite another , especially when a country is in a hole as deep as greece 's . 
   syriza 's programme , if fully implemented , will result in a sharp fall in revenues and a large increase in social spending . 
  yet many greeks stopped paying taxes before last month 's elections , anticipating cuts and forbearance . 
  government revenues fell by more than 20 % in january on an annual basis ; the 2015 budget is now likely to be derailed by the end of march , says a former finance minister . 
  current data . 
  edit : i am going to absolutely not trust those numbers in the wiki link because the heritage foundation i 'm guessing is using government published data . 
  i ca n't tell as they do n't show their methodology . 
  why ? 
  because the greek government is absolutely untrustworthy . 
  why do i say this ? 
  well read [ this ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/12/16/143766906/a-technocrat-in-trouble )  andreas georgiou is the technocrat charged with running the greek statistics office -- the same office that , in the years leading up to the financial crisis , produced wildly distorted reports of greece 's finances . 
   `` my goal is to make this a competent , boring institution and not to be in the limelight , '' georgiou told me recently . 
  `` not to have to give an interview like this one . '', 
  or how about the [ ft ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5776ca06-47bb-11e4-ac9f-00144feab7de.html#axzz3evgbcnw8 )  so far , though , his efforts have been met with resistance , strikes and a criminal investigation that could lead to life in prison for georgiou . 
  and what about the [ international statistics institute ] ( http://www.isi-web.org/images/news/20130304isigreece-statement.pdf ) ? 
   the undersigned isi representatives are making this statement to express their profound disappointment and serious concern over the prosecution of mr andreas georgiou , president of the hellenic statistical authority ( elstat ) and two of his elstat managers . 
  the charges against mr georgiou and two of his managers of exaggerating the estimates of greek government deficit and debt for the year 2009 are fanciful and not consistent with the facts . 
  and as far as i can tell , the criminal case is * still * ongoing ... 
  if this statistician is saying x and the greek government is threatening him with jail . 
  why in the name of all that 's crappy should i trust any of the greek gov numbers ? 
  yeah because the source he uses well i mean look at this ... http://www.chicagobooth.edu/blogs/informingreform/docs/taxevasion.pdf it 's mind boggling . 
  how does your source reconcile with this [ source ] ( http://www.chicagobooth.edu/blogs/informingreform/docs/taxevasion.pdf ) then ? 
  i am interested in what you have to say and wish to subscribe to your newsletter . 
  yeah here are some screenshots of the home pages of the popular newspapers websites in the uk ( and bbc news ) http://imgur.com/a/hzd2v p.s. 
  i tried to screencap the daily mail site and all custom javacode and css broke the screenshot app in half it appears lol .

  see that table ? 
  it 's an estimate of how many greeks per sector are fucking with their taxes and by how much , you think the top 5 groups do n't easily match and outweigh a couple hundred oligarchs ? 
  so taking those numbers as a given , greece according to world bank data has around 6 doctors per 1,000 people , so taking 11,000,000 as the population and the 75 % and 30k figure they 're dodging taxes by i get 1,138,500,000 that 's 1.1 bn right there and change .

  seriously . 
  just from two professions i 've pulled out a back of a napkin calculation that you could argue against i agree number of three fucking billion euros just not being collected !, 
  i 'd argue the greek politicians and greek people knew full fucking well what they 're doing . 
  i do n't * want * them to starve , i just have absolutely reached the end of my giving a fuck stick . 
  i do n't care anymore . 
  they can go to the red cross or russia for all i care from now on . 
  in all of europe except greece ? 
  pretty much . 
  in greece ? 
  it 's those `` filthy nazi germans fault/sneaky british bankers/evil oligarchs / $ insertrandomrichernationorcareerenemyofthedayhere $ '', 
  that single mother , that granny , they voted in syriza . 
  they voted in the people who flat out lied to them about what was achievable . 
  it 's a damn disgrace that the greek people voted in the idiots who precipitated this disaster .
