  this is entirely a situation of their own making and i have absolutely no sympathy left in me whatsoever . 
  to all the people saying we need to be generous , to help them out , to forgive them and help them back on their feet , i say this . 
  why ? 
  because this is a situation entirely of our own making , ours being both the rest of europe and greece itself . 
  why do i say this ? 
  because for decades the unmitigated and shocking forms that greece as a nation has taken from the lowliest of citizens to the government and their behaviour has led me to believe that greeks overall believe they should be allowed to get away with any kinds of shit they want just because . 
  what kind of behaviour am i talking about ? 
  pure criminality , there is no other way to describe it .

  the cake is a lie just like almost every other single promise syriza has made . 
  greece should never have been allowed in the eu or the euro , we screwed up in the rest of europe pushing for it yes , but as you can see there is nothing they offer to us except a culture of corruption and fraud . 
  frankly they need to be out of the eu , they 're a dead albatross hanging on our necks and can only bring us all down if they stay in . 
  interesting , this is going to be a fairly tangled reply touching on this concept , that some people do hope and wish for a rejuvenated france to come out of a brexit , is it likely ? 
  no not really , is it possible ? 
  yes . 
  some of the forecasting we 've done at work suggested a faint chance that france and the southern european states could push for a more protectionist agenda in the eu as a whole , many of the smaller eastern european states imo could be swayed to align with . 
  this in turn would lead to a less efficient and far more cumbersome/top heavy eu which in the medium to long term would play to the uk 's economic strengths as a financial center and international trade . 
  this would also put more pressure on the northern eu states especially germany to look at the south with more antipathy . 
  but of course this has to be all taken with a huge grain of salt as it 's political forecasting/modelling . 
  but it 's an interesting concept nonetheless . 
  japan does n't really `` innovate '' does it ? 
  they 're good at refining other peoples ideas but actual innovation ? 
  not so much . 
  for the most part in europe as a whole it is a matter of debt vs equity financing . 
  the usa and i would argue the uk stand separate from europe on this in that new startups are encouraged to try for equity financing vs taking on bank debts in the form of loans . 
  this leads to a very different attitude in the startup . 
  with a bank loan your own shit is on the line and you have to be conservative and play it safe . 
  with equity financing you 're risking the company and trying to get it to grow . 
  people are betting on you then . 
  it leads to an incredibly different culture with regards to risk creating a risk taking culture instead of a risk averse one . 
  there is n't any information sharing as it is , most of the information sharing has been done in spite of the the eu not because of it . 
  most european countries run information sharing deals outside of the eu framework not in it . 
  they do n't work .

   today more than 6 billion people have a mobile phone -- more than have access to a toilet , according to a un study . 
  many assume that the mobile succeeded where the landline failed , because the superior technology made widespread coverage more possible . 
  there is something to that . 
   but the main reason , simply , is that , to get a landline , you need a bank account and credit . 
  the main reason landlines failed is it requires a lot of fucking copper and infrastructure spending . 
  seriously who the fuck is this dominick frisby ? 
  it is n't now ? 
  god dammit !, 
  what happened ? 
  the uk was in the # 1 spot last year !, 
  how did germany pip us to the top ? 
  someone find me three pointless countries to have a visa deal with now !, 
  from who ???? 
  when ? 
  where ??? 
  only with the help of 3 other nations providing heavy lift capability . 
  not just that , but there 's the bosphorus strait too which is really important . 
  the german military is in a terrible state of affairs where almost all of their equipment is barely maintained to an even conditional standard . 
  as it is right now the bundeswehr and etc can barely even cope with their current commitments . 
  http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/warfare/2016/01/26/german-military-called-overstretched-underfunded/79363208/ if the syrian civil war had happened on it 's doorstep the military would have been able to do exactly jack and shit about it . 
  oil prices ? 
  dirt cheap . 
  so cheap it 's actually cheaper to mothball it for now and keep whats little left of the brent crude . 
  steel ? 
  year on year getting cheaper . 
  see third world country resource extraction point as above . 
  i 'm not sure that that is a good thing though . 
  i read an article a few weeks ago about the differences in investment philosophies between the us/uk and continental europe ( i 'll try to dig up the article ) but it seemed that a lot more startups and entrepreneurs were able to try it on because in the uk/us style economies risk not debt was the way these companies got their startup/operating capital , whereas on the continent it was debt and that meant banks and that means being super conservative . 
  a surprising amount actually around 13 % or so , a lot of car , ship and heavy vehicle manufacturing , but also with a fair chunk in high tech manufacturing , bae and rr etc etc. 
  there is also the chemical engineering side with a lot of refineries and concomitant to that the pharma industry which uses all those volatiles to make interesting drugs . 
  so production and manufactory ? 
  a lot , mined ? 
  fuck all , but as i said before most of that is heavy industry that has been offshored to the third world anyway . 
  meh , generally resource extraction occurs in piss poor developing nations so its cheap . 
  lobby for that then , but stop trying to call it something is n't in the future . 
  just because you do n't like it does n't make it illegal . 
  continuing in this vein just makes you look too uneducated to discuss the issue . 
  it 's not tax evasion simply put , due to the single market using taxation rules to compete against each other . 
  welcome to the european union and the [ internal market ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internal_market ), 
  and the follow up i think ... or maybe before it ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvrn-gkzvyi, 
  this . 
  i came to post this . 
  it 's a very different financing culture in continental europe to the rotw . 
  really simplifying the explanation in the rotw they 're prepared to go with risk , meaning shares/vc etc whereas on the continent small businesses are expected to go with debt ie bank loans . 
  i 'm literally crying tears of jealousy now . 
  how will i ever experience such munificence of grandeur ? 
  yeah , because it 's great tat to sell the tourists . 
  food security costing us 47 % of the budget ? 
  seriously ? 
  it 's a sop to the french nothing more . 
   without cap we 'd be extremely reliant of food imports , to the extent that different sorts of crisis abroad could cause us ( eu-citizens ) to stave ( less likely ) or see extreme price increases . 
  such crisis could be : drought/decreased production in foreign countries , increased transportation costs or blackmail ( forcing the eu to do something because it would not get food otherwise ) . 
  we 're dumping food on the markets and harming developing economies or throwing away millions of tonnes of food because we have such an over abundance of it it 's not even funny . 
  claiming we need cap for food security is like saying we need a main battle tank because we 're scared of being burgled . 
  http://www.economist.com/node/2705953  the french now have a line , first drawn by mr chirac a year ago , that any concessions on export subsidies must benefit poor african countries . 
  `` if it is to help poor countries , yes ; if it is to help rich counties increase their market share in europe , then no , '' says one official . 
   helping africa is a laudable objective . 
  but french concessions in the name of reform do not always amount to much . 
  the deal hatched between mr chirac and germany 's gerhard schr\u00f6der in late 2002 , which freezes cap spending in real terms until 2013 , was hailed in france as a big concession . 
  the more liberal-minded hoped that it might force through deeper cap reform , by holding down spending even after the ten new eu members had joined . 
  yet , with these ( farm-intensive ) arrivals queuing up for their turn at the trough , it looks more like a deal to shelter the cap from a radical overhaul . 
  i would say i am about 80-20 split for leaving , but i can guarantee you right now this second one thing that would completely swing my vote over to staying in . 
  abolition of the cap . 
  farmers represent 5.4 percent of the eu 's population . 
  they generate a mere 1.6 percent of the union 's gdp .
