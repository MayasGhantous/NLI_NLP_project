  yet they receive 47 percent of the eu 's total budget through cap handouts . 
  europe 's taxpayers hand over $ 58 billion in subsidies to this tiny , unproductive minority . 
  in times of economic hardship that just does n't make sense . 
  they tried this in 2005 with the eu constitution and when that failed they tried forcing it through by changing it to the treaty of lisbon in 2008 and only narrowly managed to push it through after 2 referendums on the issue ( a year apart ) in 2009 in ireland . 
  `` voluntary '' ? 
  really ? 
  when politicians decided that the eec was n't enough i do n't remember many plebiscites happening amongst the member nations , do you ? 
  what about the two referendums that were held about the european constitution ? 
  when that failed a `` period of reflection '' was held ... what happened next ? 
  oh yes , the tried to make it happen by stealth with the lisbon treaty instead . 
  then when ireland had to have a referendum on it and they lost , what did they do ? 
  have another referendum again a year later this time getting a result that the european federalists were happy with !, 
  yes ... completely voluntary . 
  well you know , there was the whole british empire thing we did to the indians for a while including all the murdering and as soon as we left there was the massive partitioning and violence that happened afterwards . 
  kind of important . 
  i 'm a foreign policy/defence/security / military wonk so for me , the eu are a joke and just never really considered until merkel tries to stick her oar in and makes a mess as usual . 
  well frankly i 've seen about the direction that europe is trying to `` pull '' us towards and i 'm not really all that in favour of it . 
  letting merkel appease putin because she 's terrified of the shutting off of gas imports , allowing schauble to act like some kind of thug to the greeks when they needed genuine aid and assistance ( if you look through my posting history then you will absolutely see that i am far from being a fan of the greeks during their austerity crisis ) . 
  how about the way the refugee situation has been handled ? 
  when europe should have been acting in a cohesive manner to these crises instead it was a squabbling petty morass that it is . 
  the eu is never brought up in political discussions in some spheres because frankly the eu means absolutely nothing to us in those areas . 
  defence and security issues for one because frankly the whole eu command structure is a mess and it 's just far far easier to use nato instead . 
  very focused on `` internal '' issues ? 
  out of all of the eu i 'd say either the uk or france are the two most savvy nations when it comes to foreign policy . 
  well they get sweet fuck all sympathy from me . 
  i 'm 100 % serious , this was something that was known about for decades in the coming . 
  the french government did nothing but pander to the french farming bloc who themselves did nothing but stick their fingers in their ears and ignored reality for some bucolic fantasy , this is purely the end result of it . 
  if france wants to reinstate quotas that 's fine , good luck with all the eu treaties then . 
  they 're the ones who lobbied politically for this artificial bubble that reality has now fucked . 
  including germany in that line up is really really really delusional and quite hilarious , read up on the current state of german forces , `` a complete and utter joke '' would be a compliment . 
  i 'm not , this is purely the obvious and end result of all the lobbying that created the cap . 
  time for french farmers to pay the piper . 
  we do give farmers special treatment though , the cap is ridiculous and has saved the incredibly inefficient french farming model decades past when they should have modernised , the current state of the french economy is just a complete omnishambles , if the french consumers want to save the french farms out of some romanticised bucolic ideal then they can pay for it . 
  but they do n't want to and this is the cost . 
  welcome to cold hard reality . 
   the results provide clear evidence of a significant impact of eu grants on unemployment . 
  over the fifteen analysed years in which cornwall has been in receipt of eu funds , the proportion of people claiming unemployment benefits has been consistently and significantly lower than in the counterfactual comparison . 
  in cornwall the percentage of unemployment benefit claimants has declined by 30 percent more than the counterfactual region . 
  the empirical analysis makes sure that this effect is driven by eu funds and not by other potentially confounding policies . 
  interesting that you 're calling these people retards when their life has significantly and been provably improved ( oh those pesky experts ! ), 
  whereas it appears that your reading comprehension is deplorably pathetic . 
  or you 're one of those idiots who think trade treaties are bad things . 
  either way i 'm not very surprised at all that you 'd be so dismissive . 
  when you 're able to get past the petty jealousy and admit that london pays for the rest of the uk ? 
  http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/06/20/cornwall-and-wales-benefited-from-eu/  in order to single out the effects of the funds , 1992-2014 regional trends of unemployment benefit claimants in cornwall and south yorkshire are compared to those of a set of ` counterfactual regions ' being similar in all characteristics except for not having being eligible to obtain the same proportion of structural funds .

  you mean the same eu globalisation policies that provided the poorest regions in the uk with extra development funding ? 
  the poorest areas suffered from massive deindustrialisation and the people there just wanted someone to blame because mining and factories do n't exist any more in a modern service sector economy , where skills and knowledge not traditional labour are paramount . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/07/london-top-taxpaying-city-uk-report  london has cemented its position as britain 's number one taxpayer since the financial crash , leaving the government more dependent on the capital for its tax income . 
  a study by the thinktank the centre for cities found that london generated almost as much tax as the next 37 largest cities combined and increased its share of `` economy taxes '' underpinning the treasury 's finances to 30 % , up five percentage points since 2004/5 . 
  but to address this point . 
   it does n't really spread it around . 
  it 's well known that london pretty much drains all money and talent from the uk . 
  did you know that the remittances for stamp duty from kensington , knightsbridge and chelsea equalled the stamp duty from wales , scotland and northern ireland ? 
  the most up to date figures i could find ? 
  http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/stamp-duty-burden-on-london-home-buyers-spirals-to-a-record-3-billion-a2958726.html  the # 1.4 billion stamp duty receipts from the five biggest contributing boroughs are roughly the same as those from northern ireland , wales , scotland , the north-east , north-west , yorkshire & humber and the east and west midlands combined . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/10-london-boroughs-worth-more-than-all-the-homes-in-wales-scotland-and-northern-ireland-8478990.html  but it is in london that the extraordinary gulf is most starkly illustrated , according to the research by the property group savills as part of its latest valuing britain analysis of the uk market . 
  the capital 's richest borough , westminster , with 121,600 dwellings , is worth # 95bn -- more than twice the value of edinburgh ( pop 500,000 ) and three times that of england 's sixth most populous city , bristol . 
  when you can get over your own small minded and venal jealousy you 'll realise you 're talking utter bollocks . 
  to quote from the the seventy maxims of maximally effective mercenaries  there is no ` overkill . ', 
  there is only ` open fire ' and ' i need to reload . ', 
  i know i am , i really would n't shed a tear if those no borders idiots were accidentally run over and then shot and then dropped off a cliff twenty times . 
  it 's not even pity , i just wish they 'd get out of the fucking way now . 
  to pity the russians i 'd have to consider them and frankly i barely ever even think about them . 
  they never ever factor into my calculus at all . 
  try to tell that to lord haw haw , except you ca n't . 
  we executed him . 
  but you 're all missing the point , freedom of speech as a right as it is normally seen is used to govern a state from silencing it 's own citizens , not to protect an absolutely hostile foreign power which does n't grant the same rights to its own citizens . 
  freedom of speech does n't include the right of a foreign government to spread lies and propaganda . 
  edit : thanks for all the interesting replies , but i fundamentally disagree as we in the west allow freedom of speech and expression for our citizens , however we also individually and societally have the right to self defence and i believe that while russia is not currently an existential threat to liberal democracies , putin is trying damn hard to turn russia into one . 
  this is what gives us the right to shut them down . 
  this is what gives us the right to shut down hate preachers too . 
  i 'd have said the whole degree of hostility the french seem to have against financiers and their whole attempt at starting up an ftt makes paris a non starter . 
  that and their still insane labour laws , despite the reforms that passed , oh and every other weekend when they strike . 
  those unpopular labour reforms had to happen though because all the economists told him `` yeah , this whole workers paradise you 're trying to build is n't happening . '', 
  oh please , that would never have happened , the giant chip on their shoulder would never allow that to happen because we 'd have to pander to the russians ego constantly to get anything done . 
  pretending that they 're a full and equal partner in everything . 
  sometimes an exigent situation happens and shit needs to happen immediately and boom . 
  the russians ego comes out in all of it 's ( tiny ) dick swinging glory again . 
   misleading . 
  the failure to properly engage russia as a partner during the yeltsin years counts as one of the main failures of the wetsern policy . 
  mostly it is blamed on the usa . 
  mainly only in russia , but honest question , why should the west have engaged with russia ? 
  give me a solid compelling reason why . 
  the country was a shambles after decades of mismanagement and corruption and who wants to be involved in that mess ? 
  well ? 
  why ? 
  they 're a failed superpower slash bullying regional power and the only reason we have to worry about them is that they have nukes . 
  their conventional military is a joke and their economy is a farce . 
  seriously tell me what russia has to offer to the world beyond ignorance and internet tough guy posturing ? 
  you ca n't and this is why they 're now an embittered and tiny backwater of the world . 
  kind of , the docklands light railway was the main cornerstone of infrastructure development for the regeneration for the area . 
  you 're right in one sense though , the usage wildly beat the projections and estimations initially laid out hence the expansion in 1991 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/docklands_light_railway#first_stage_extensions_.281991.e2.80.931994.29, 
  you know i remember a few months ago of many germans ( in the midst of many other europeans complaining on / r/europe ) about the [ special ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3808an/german_satirical_news_show_on_the_possibility_of/crrbqp6 ) [ treatment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3808an/german_satirical_news_show_on_the_possibility_of/crrofh5 ) [ the ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/471d3v/how_does_the_rest_of_europe_feel_about_the_uk/d09hoda ) [ uk ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4oxec7/last_week_tonight_with_john_oliver_brexit/d4gkiqj ) [ gets ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/503re5/uk_must_pay_for_brexit_or_eu_is_in_deep_trouble/d710y6r ) , i hesitate to use the german word schadenfreude right now but it does seem rather apt and delicious to me . 
  after a quick google it seems ah hah !, 
  yes it seems like those are the things !, 
  thank you !,
