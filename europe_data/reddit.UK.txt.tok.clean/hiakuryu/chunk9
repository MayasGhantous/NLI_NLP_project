  antwerp fucking cheated by fixing the statistics !, 
  recount !, 
  this is post truth statistics !, 
  you know what makes me laugh so hard ? 
  how the most homophobic people are invariably repressing their own homosexual desires . 
  http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/13/survey-reveals-searches-for-gay-porn-are-top-in-countries-banning-homosexuality/  in the interactive survey , run by porn search engine pornmd , were published global searching habits , and it appeared to show that gay porn was even more popular than straight porn in countries where homosexuality was illegal . 
  *** cough *** nope no one closeted in those countries , nosiree !, 
  lots of pushing and fucking comments in this thread , by the georgian who says he does n't care [ hmmm ] ( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/homophobes-might-be-hidden-homosexuals/ ) none of us are buying that tbh http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18109022 http://humanrightshouse.org/articles/18052.html https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/05/virulent-homophobic-attacks-put-south-caucasus-activists-risk/ http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-17/news/sns-rt-us-georgia-gays-russiabre94g0s7-20130517_1_equal-rights-tblisi-georgia http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22571216, 
  but if you did n't care enough about the topic in the first place why even comment ? 
    if a heterosexual couple walks down the street holding hands  i do n't give a fuck . 
    if a homosexual couple does it  i do n't give a fuck about it either . 
  you seem to care enough to write how many posts about this subject ? 
   that is why it 's still considered to be 2nd best military today ? 
  by who ??? 
   and what makes you think that if war breaks out it will be those fresh conscripts fighting ? 
  conscription means that they can quickly mobilize large force that already served 1 + year in the army as addition to it professional forces . 
  which professional forces ? 
  their nco cadre is non-existant . 
   and whose military is stronger ? 
  perhaps germany ? 
  oh wait british ? 
  lol out of all countries only usa , china and india can match russia military strength today . 
  thanks for proving my point . 
  mainly i 'm just sick and tired of russian apologists with their rampant historical revisionism trying to portray their `` great '' nation as anything even remotely resembling competent . 
  russian history as taught in russia , especially with regards to ww2 is mostly lies and fabrications built upon fantasy . 
  currently the russian military is a joke , their regular forces are 1 year conscripts for the most part who can barely string together a combined arms operation , ca n't tell the difference between an enemy jet and a passenger aircraft , could n't even beat a third rate tinpot craphole in the caucases . 
  frankly i 'm mainly in agreement with the ops link . 
  russia is desperately trying to stay relevant hence their juvenile actions in eastern europe . 
  we tried to bring the backwards fucks up to a modern standard of living in the 90 's and sure the west fucked up , yes we made some missteps but the russians did everything in their power to enlarge the gigantic chip on their shoulder and buy into this ridiculous strong russian man bullshit myth they 're so desperate for the rest of the world to buy into . 
  i just want the juvenile little shits to grow up and know their place in the world , producing miserable and depressing writers and some talented composers . 
  no i 'm pretty sure the modernisation program started before the russo-georgia conflict and well it 's still pretty ineffective from what i can see . 
  they have however gotten very good at mixing in their intelligence operations into muddying the political waters . 
  you really want to bring up syria ? 
  where the ground war was mostly limited sf units again doing not much . 
  it 's mainly been the ruaf dropping dumb bombs/cluster munitions/incendiaries [ indiscriminately ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/russia-today-syria-war-cluster-bomb-footage-censorship-video-vladimir-putin-a7093141.html ) almost nothing guided has been used . 
  wait ... 
  the russian air force , guided munitions ... * snort * i really ca n't believe you 're arguing about a military that has only started using [ socks in the last three years ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/jan/16/russian-soldiers-replacing-foot-wraps-socks ) . 
  actually you 're right , they * are * modernising . 
  wwii did happen , and russia did a fantastic job before the great patriotic war of signing a treaty with german first and then another one with japan . 
  but i guess invading poland from the east does n't count as the start of the `` great patriotic war '' does it ? 
  sure the russians may have paid the majority of the butchers bill in ww2 , but the americans and the british paid the rest of the bill for the soviet army . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lend-lease#us_deliveries_to_the_soviet_union https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lend-lease#british_deliveries_to_the_soviet_union united states | united kingdom -- | -- 427,284 trucks | 3,000 + hurricanes 13,303 combat vehicles | 4,000 + other aircraft 35,170 motorcycles | 27 naval vessels 2,328 ordnance service vehicles | 5,218 tanks 2,670,371 tons of petroleum products ( gasoline and oil ) | 5,000 + anti-tank guns 4,478,116 tons of foodstuffs ( canned meats , sugar , flour , salt , etc. ),

  | when nikolai voznesensky wrote in voennaya ekonomika sssr v period otechestvennoi voiny [ soviet military complex during the great patriotic war ] ( moscow : gospolitizdat , 1948 ) ,  `` if one compares the quantity of industrial goods sent by the allies to the ussr with the quantity of industrial goods manufactured by socialist factories in the soviet union , it is apparent that the former are equal to only about 4 % of what was produced domestically during the years of the war economy . '' yes , i for one have complete faith in those soviet statistics . 
  they *** never *** lied . 
  or tried to hide the molotov-ribbentrop pact for 40 years , or pretended it has never happened to this day ... 
  but anyway ... back to the numbers 11 billion was supplied via lend lease add in the british contributions which is roughly around 400m and change , not adding in the whole stuff just given for free by the us on top . 
  lets just say $ 11,000,000,000 in 1947 dollars ok ? 
  forget the uk , if that was only 4 % of the entire domestic soviet output that would have meant ... the soviet union was producing to the tune of $ 275,000,000,000 in comparison . 
  how did the soviet union immediately not steam roller the rest of western europe at the end of ww2 hmm ? 
  ah ok thanks for clearing that up it seemed odd to me that romanian isp 's would n't have lots of peering connections and etc to outside of the country when he said it . 
  i would say it is n't . 
  uh ... no , if it was n't for the nukes no one would take the russian military even remotely seriously . 
  ever since the first russo-japanese war when imperial russian navy was soundly defeated at the battle of tsushima by the imperial japanese navy and the whole world said `` wait ? 
  japan has a navy ? '', 
  russia | japan -- | -- 4,380 dead | 117 dead 5,917 captured | 583 injured 6 battleships sunk | 3 torpedo boats sunk 1 coastal battleship sunk | 14 other ships sunk | 7 ships captured | 6 ships disarmed | and let us not forget the dogger bank incident either where the russian navy sailing for japan mistook 6 british fishing trawlers for imperial japanese navy ships ... in the north sea ... and shot at them . 
  a lot . 
  and missed . 
  a lot . 
  they only managed to kill 3 sailors on the british trawlers , but they managed to kill a few russian sailors , and a priest . 
  i could make this more modern and relevant and talk about the admiral kuznetsov the main reason western navies are terrified of the kuznetsov is less about the firepower of the thing and more about the [ ongoing threat of an environmental disaster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_cork_oil_spill ) it poses anyone it sails near , especially if the [ ship breaks down ] ( http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a18141/towing-admiral-kuznetsov-video-tugboat/ ) , there 's also the threat it [ poses to it 's own crew ] ( https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1g1-56830464.html ) and [ pilots ] ( https://theaviationist.com/2016/12/05/russian-su-33-crashed-in-the-mediterranean-while-attempting-to-land-on-kuznetsov-aircraft-carrier/ ) . 
  or the time in the russo-georgia war when the ruaf tu22m3 a supersonic bomber got shot down by the georgian air defence network ( [ maybe ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8142999.stm ) ) , which was sold to them god knows how many odd years before by the russian army . 
  or when the so called russian army special forces spetsnaz troops were photographed by [ ap ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wzjxa0p.jpg ) ( it 's an imgur link because the picture is from a daily mail story and i do try my best to not link to them because well , they 're the dm ) . 
  we can tell they 're special forces units because the rifle the guy on the left is holding is a vss vintorez which is only really issued to sf units . 
  there simply is n't a roll eyes big enough for me to consider how not a threat conventionally russia is . 
  nor has it ever been to be honest . 
  if the new stuff even works . 
  i heard from a romanian buddy that the internet inside of romania is shit hot and amazing but as soon as you try to download anything from outside , like a game on steam it shits itself . 
  is this true or did i get it wrong somehow ? 
  i 'll support you in subjugating / r/sweden from / r/unitedkingdom if only to make sure we contain kalles kaviar . 
  food should not ever come in toothpaste tubes . 
  thinking about it , calling kalles kaviar food is a giant stretch . 
  see !, 
  i have proof !, 
  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl1jvo1puexzxjnkdbwc5dmq10kgeaaw7r let the marmite wars begin !, 
  i 'm calling on / r/australia to pitch in as well because vegemite is an offshoot of marmite ( admittedly a lesser one ) . 
  wait , uh , he 's wearing a navy forage cap of some kind , poland has a navy ? 
  oh well turkey has the 416 and 417 under license and um your flag flair says netherlands so ... 
  i was confused :d, 
  i think the dutch bought both rifles for their commandos , sof , hrt/swat guys blah blah blah etc etc, 
  well honest question would the turks have bought from hk anyway ? 
  i mean compared to many other firms hk is very expensive even with a government contract . 
  i could find cheaper and comparable weapons from other firms . 
  also as others have said there are already tons of other companies who have h&k licenses anyway including turkish firms . 
   but revenue from taxes was just 282.1 billion euro . 
  defence budget would have been 21.4 % of all taxes collected by the federal government . 
  http://www.oecd.org/ctp/consumption/revenue-statistics-and-consumption-tax-trends-2014-germany.pdf but for even further proof . 
  http://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/content/de/standardartikel/themen/steuern/steuerschaetzungen_und_steuereinnahmen/2015-01-30-steuereinnahmen-kalenderjahr-2014.pdf?__blob=publicationfile&amp;v=2 in 2014 , german tax revenue totaled $ 593 billion . 
  run that maths by me because i 'm pretty sure it does n't work . 
   2 % of gdp can be well over 20 % of all the taxes collected in some of these eastern european countries . 
  got it , you 're utterly incapable of telling me why russia is a good country and why it should be proud of it 's history . 
  instead of debating in good faith with sources you 're just going to sit there chewing on your own bile muttering to yourself how we should all acknowledge russia for being amazing . 
  i did n't know the russians were involved then , were russian units working in concordance to the [ secret protocols of the molotov-ribbentrop pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact#the_secret_protocol ) i mean we all know how russians keep on [ lying ] ( http://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2009/06/russian_military_historian_say.html ) [ about how they were ] ( https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-crimea-and-the-good-hitler/25322600.html ) [ always on the right side of history in ww2 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/07/vladimir-putin-defended-nazi-soviet-pact-west-world-war-two ) , [ those dirty poles were asking for it i guess . 
  ] ( http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ajc-denounces-moscows-world-war-ii-historical-revisionism-against-poland-300149598.html ), 
  it 's incredibly amusing when people like you try to justify the `` rich history and culture '' of russia without ever giving any concrete examples of it . 
  carry on . 
  it 's really cute that you people keep on saying russia is special and has an amazing history and rich culture especially when you never ever show any examples of it . 
  * cough * oh look , a russian apologist again . 
   britain never had any impressive land army https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_waterloo  this is the level of your argument . 
  it 's nonsencial and idiotic .
