  i think the usa being glamorised in hollywood films ad american tv ( which are both quite popular across europe ) helps tourism . 
  that 's the `` jungle '' in calais , the uk has a kind of border in france where migrants will be stopped from entering the uk but remain in france . 
  the uk parliament passed a bill to allow article 50 to be triggered by the government . 
  it was a large majority , 498 to 114 , which also included votes from opposition parties . 
  at this stage it needs further reading but it 's pretty much as good as done . 
   calais ( last piece of france ruled by england ) we 're still [ holding on ] ( http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/calais-1-624937.jpg ) to a little bit of it !, 
   but on the plus side : duty free ferries !, 
  listen , we all know by now that finland does n't exist so i can only assume these ferries are provided by japan to get you to russia ? 
  we do n't have one , at least not in the sense that other countries do . 
  we operate more by an unwritten constitution where ~ ~ politicians just make it up as they go along ~ ~ it 's made up of law , acts of parliament , common convention etc. 
   the most common fraud is to fake a handicap and get disability payments . 
  that 's similar here , so recently the government have also tightened up who gets these benefits . 
  people get assessments before they can claim disability benefits , but sometimes they 're harsh . 
  even people with genuine disabilities get deemed `` fit for work '' a lot of the time , because they can perhaps spell words and write , or walk 100m on their own . 
  but still , we have a generous welfare system in the uk for people who genuinely need it . 
  i think it 's pretty ridiculous to be fair but they look at it spending the same amount of time looking for work as someone who does work . 
  they also track what you apply for because you have to log it on their system every time you submit an application . 
  i 'd struggle spending more than a few hours a day searching and applying . 
  if i ever went on to benefits i 'd just pretend i was extremely slow . 
  the government are purposefully making being on job seekers benefits a pain for the client in an effort to get them to take anything that comes up . 
  people are practically forced into jobs found for them by uninterested staff . 
  in the uk they are pretty harsh with this now . 
  it was easier in the past to live off the state , but now people are being made to search for jobs full time , so often someone has to do 35 hours a week of job searching . 
  after a period of time ( depends on your circumstances ) you might be ordered to go on job trials or placements and work for free for some time . 
  the idea of this is that it gives someone experience and may land them with a proper job , but in reality it gets abused by greedy companies who get work for free . 
  they will also sanction benefit payments if someone refuses a reasonable offer , does n't stick to their agreement ( which is things like apply for x amount of jobs , broaden your search criteria after x amount of months ) , misses appointments etc. 
  disabled people are an exception to this , but only if their disability means they ca n't work . 
  there will be some who slip through the system and just live a life on benefits , but these are usually long term unemployed people with no proper job history , people with criminal convictions , really stupid people who have no hope in life ... 
  i would love to live for free but life is not so sweet and i get a bit annoyed at people who think it 's their right to live off everyone else 's money . 
  the benefit system if there for people who need it , not people who abuse it . 
  they 're refugees , though . 
  even if someone was a muslim what is to say they are a practising one ? 
  you ca n't ban someone based on a religion that already has a presence in the country they 're immigrating to . 
  that 's borderline nationalsozialismus . 
  but even people within europe already could hold views that are homophobic , from all kinds of religions , races etc. 
  that is n't an indicator that they are muslim . 
  i assume this test exists to see how they will fit in with norwegian society , which is a lot more liberal than the countries in the middle east . 
  what happens when someone is a muslim but say they 're a christian instead ? 
  how is this policed ? 
  it 's silly to try and ban a specific religious group from immigrating . 
  only wales has an official one , the rest are unofficial . 
  there is none for england other than the uk ( and parts of the commonwealth ) wide one `` god save the queen '' . 
  scotland and northern ireland use unofficial ones in sporting events when they compete as separate nations . 
  the biggest drawback is that they have jeremy corbyn as the leader ... 
  jinx touch wood ... 
  stop it slovenia !, 
  american film are the `` de facto '' films at the cinema , because hollywood spews them out quicker than anywhere else . 
  we also get a lot of british films being released and there 's a lot of films where the uk and usa have collaborated . 
  it 's rare we 'll get a european film released in mainstream cinemas unless it was in english . 
  like with anything , it depends on the film . 
  some are seen as absolute garbage , some are seen as brilliant . 
  i often find big budget hollywood films really boring because they 're full of clich\u00e9 , lack originality and the stories have probably been done to death . 
  hollywood is running out of ideas . 
  i care a lot about not caring about the superbowl . 
  haha . 
  cheers . 
  now i know what i 'm talking about !, 
  if your immediate family is from another county then it 's fine . 
  it 's when the link is 5 or 6 generations it gets a little weird . 
  we have it pretty good in the uk but we 're a bunch of proper moaners and the weather is the biggest thing we moan about . 
  i genuinely think people care more about the weather here than they do anything else . 
  it 's probably the unpredictability of it ; organise an outdoor wedding in the middle of summer when the forecast says 30 \u00b0 c and bright sun ... then it rains . 
  i do n't know :-( ^ ^ ^ ^ ( psst , ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ some ^ ^ ^ weird ^ ^ ^ thing ^ ^ ^ started ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ reddit ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ going ^ ^ ^ along ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ it . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ idea ^ ^ ^ where ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ even ^ ^ ^ came ^ ^ ^ from ), 
  in the main parts of the uk winter is mild . 
  it gets more extreme the further north you get and the highlands of scotland get heavy snow . 
  but , for most of the population a blanket of 2cm of snow is enough to cause utter chaos because we are never prepared , schoolss close , transport gets cancelled , people ca n't get to work . 
  we rarely get extreme weather . 
  we have luke warm summers and relatively mild winters . 
  in the middle of winter the average temperature rarely falls below 0 \u00b0 c ( 32 \u00b0 f ) , and the average lowest is 1 \u00b0 c. 
  even in scotland , which takes into account the extreme north of the mainland and the highlands ) the average lowest temperature in january is just under 0 \u00b0 c i live in the north east of england and today it 's 10 \u00b0 c ( 50 \u00b0 f ) , sunny , slight cloud coverage . 
  the local beaches are full of topless men and women in bathing suits ^ ( may ^ be ^ a ^ lie ) for a country on the same latitude as central canada you 'd expect the weather to be a lot more extreme but , like much of this part of the world , we 're protected by the gulf stream ( or the north atlantic drift , depending on which science you read ) . 
  edit : bloody hell , my posts have been a bit long today !, 
  i need a hobby !, 
  you will never know the struggle of having no access to pineapples . 
  it 's simply because western europe is more closely aligned to the usa than it is russia , we are allies , we are part of many of the same organisations ( nato being one ) and we have a stronger connection with the usa than we do russia . 
  i do n't think many people will agree with what america do in places like the middle east but it 's meant to be for ~ ~ oil ~ ~ the greater good , rather than just wanting an empire . 
  this talk of `` no-go '' areas from more right wing media is clearly a reference to areas with strong muslim communities . 
  it 's not referring to dodgy areas full of crime and deprivation , but in some cases the two go hand in hand . 
  this is not because islam makes it like that , it 's probably because housing is cheap and these are the areas where immigrants originally settled when they first started to come to the uk in larger numbers ( in the 50s and 60s ? ), 
  in my town the main areas where muslim people live were quite deprived . 
  they have cheap housing and have , over time , developed into thriving communities . 
  if anything the muslim population have made the areas safer and tidier . 
  what has happened as a byproduct of this is that the area is quite obviously dominated by islam , with mosques , arabic text on shop fronts , people wearing traditional clothes from the middle east etc. 
  even the local primary schools put up banners when it 's eid or something similar . 
  this obviously puts people outside of those communities off living there . 
  the only people who tend to live there that are n't asian are students and less-well-off people because landlords buy property quite cheap and it 's close to the university . 
  they are definitely not no-go areas . 
  i have never felt unsafe going through them . 
  however , i would n't live there because i would n't fit in . 
  but , it 's not a bad thing ... 
  i would also feel the same living in a strong chinese or strong jewish community . 
  however , in recent times these areas have started to become popular with immigrants from eastern europe so when you add this to the mix local bigots are not happy . 
  ** tl ; dr ** - there are n't really any no-go areas because of islam in terms of safety but someone not from that community might feel a bit alienated if they lived there as they wo n't fit in . 
  true , but because it 's so rare they ca n't justify it . 
  i know one place that does them but only after hours . 
  it 's already started . 
  i was in a restaurant the other day and asked for a burger . 
  they apologised that they had ran out of lettuce because it 's not financially viable to provide it any more . 
  you wanted to see the waitresses face when my friend asked for pineapple on her pizza !,
