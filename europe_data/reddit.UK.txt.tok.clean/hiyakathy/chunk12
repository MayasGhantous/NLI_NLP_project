  the far left can be just as bad for the world as the far right , as history has proven . 
  people might talk about social democracy as far left but it 's not . 
  that 's just left of centre left . 
  also , merkel 's party , cdu , is centre-right not left . 
  maureen : bigot , voted for brexit because of muslims . 
  keith : boring , should have changed his name but too boring to do that . 
  any `` normal '' name spelled stupidly , like kaytee : uneducated parents `` posh '' sounding names like henrietta or barnaby : from a middle-class suburb family , or wannabe . 
  people with stupid names like `` david davidson '' or `` steven stevenson '' : unimaginative and possibly cruel parents . 
  i think russia are playing the usa and trump is falling for it . 
  putin would love america to become weaker and trump could very much cause that to happen . 
  a couple of weeks ago russia were claiming that the us troops arriving in poland were a threat to it 's national security , but now russia and the usa are braiding each other 's hair and having a sleep over ? 
  nah , i do n't buy it . 
  it 's going to be scary to watch this unfold . 
   soap & skin - vater another mention !, 
  i 'm surprised . 
  i thought no one would know her , but she has been mentioned a few times on here . 
  i hope she does more stuff in german !, 
   \u00c1sgeir - hlj\u00f3\u00f0a n\u00f3tt ( or whatever , he 's a genius ) he is great !, 
  his new album looks like it 's going to be english only , though , which is a shame because his icelandic stuff sounds much better . 
  you can get really cheap flights with budget airlines , but the downside of that is that they often fly to crappy airports and you have to spend more to get a train or coach into the city anyway . 
  i think the op is mixing up language , cultural and ethnic groupings . 
   soap & skin - vater i am pleased someone else on here knows her . 
  this is one of my favourite songs and she is quite amazing !, 
  i think the relatively unspoiled landscape , long , dark winters and 24 hour daylight summers does something to bring creativity out of people . 
  it 's alright , i like it more than most other covers ( she has a full release of army of me [ covers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/army_of_me:_remixes_and_covers ) ) . 
  my favourite version is [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbytiwfh0c ) one , so the one you posted is n't too far off !, 
  i love both skunk anansie and bj\u00f6rk so this is a perfect song for me ... but the live version is much better than the recorded ones . 
  i really like music in other languages . 
  some of my favourites : [ samaris - g\u00f3\u00f0a tungl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3tg_6pr060 ) - icelandic [ eiv\u00f8r - \u00cd tokuni ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqnmkuctmys ) - faroese [ soap & skin - vater ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdjxkww_h1w ) - german ( anja is austrian ) . 
  [ sigur r\u00f3s - s\u00e6gl\u00f3pur ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfhcwzh0_co ) - icelandic ( at least i think this one is because it somewhat translates ; some are in gibberish ! ), 
  [ \u00c1sgeir - a\u00f0 grafa sig \u00ed f\u00f6nn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_zaoyxecee ) - icelandic ( i think his english translated album is a bit weaker , seems forced ) . 
  [ christine and the queens - saint claude ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzfymz2lft4 ) - french ( really pleased she has became relatively big in the uk ) . 
  i really love icelandic music - bj\u00f6rk is one of my staples , but she does n't have that much in icelandic to share here - so if anyone has any recommendations i 'd be interested . 
  i said a hip , hop , a hip , a hippy to hibby say sowaah ooh ah a hammy and the boogie and the wiggly wee . 
  i went to paris with a friend a couple of years ago and she walked into the hotel reception and , loudly , said `` scuze me , do you have any crisps ? '' . 
  i was embarrassed for her . 
  oooh . 
  so , erm , nothing to see here ... 
  well i guess i should have said takk instead . 
  he wants to eliminate the competition . 
  the eu is a powerful force globally . 
  the problem is that he is making enemies already , which is really ridiculous for the leader of one of the most powerful nations on the planet . 
  some countries where universal healthcare is a thing have insurance based systems and still operate private hospitals , but it is still universal . 
  if someone is poor they are still entitled to the same level of healthcare as someone who is rich . 
  kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 . 
  that 's all us language ignorant brits need to know when we travel . 
  i know some words in many other languages but my mind is dead after a long week . 
  is there a tl ; dr version ? 
  yes . 
  i do n't know why anyone would think otherwise . 
  it 's so boring now . 
   it 's a shame because the vast majority of us are very tolerant . 
  if you visit r/europe with a union jack or st george 's flag flair it 's almost instantly downvoted , no matter the content . 
  other than all the brexit doom and gloom , this is another reason why i have unsubscribed from r/europe . 
  i want to stay in the eu but if you say anything remotely negative towards it then you 're instantly downvoted if you have a union jack flair . 
  i 'm not to bothered about up and down votes but it 's frustrating when you make a valid point but people do n't see past the flag . 
  yeah we do . 
  i personally say `` on the continent '' or similar but when people say `` europe '' they often mean continental europe . 
  usually sex or body parts , even loosely . 
  fuck ( sex ) cunt ( vagina ) bastard ( fatherless child , or born out of wedlock ) wanker ( masturbation ) tosser ( as above ) dick ( penis ) shit . 
  we often mix them with other words , like fucking hell , for fucks sake , fuck me , fuck you , fuck this shit ... 
  there 's all kinds of usage but i do n't need to go into detail since you all probably know english very well already . 
  i like to be more creative with my swearing and call properly things like massive clit or a cunt fucker . 
  i really want to but i do n't . 
  i love europe but i think the uk , possibly because of it 's geography , feels like a bit of an after thought . 
  it 's kind of like europe is google chome and the uk is an extension ; it 's not required to make it work but it adds something to it . 
  it will be even worse when we leave the eu . 
  i think some places in border regions between ireland and northern ireland will accept euros . 
  i remember years ago debenhams used to but that seems to have stopped . 
  although it 's not accepting euros directly some places in tourist areas will let you pay on a card with euros so it saves foreign transaction fees for the customer . 
  you 'll find the odd places in london that will accept them but they 're not common . 
  itt : very important . 
  all i 've heared about her is how she is nothing like michelle obama , how she is a trophy wife and the madness of the irony that she is slovenian . 
  i have an interest in most countries in the world , even if only a small one . 
  i honestly ca n't choose . 
  for the ones i know less about ( mainly the further eastern ones ) i 'd want to visit to find out more . 
  the cost will probably be international student rates because it 's usually dictated by residence rather than nationality . 
  international costs in most countries are quite high ( though i think some are the same as local costs ... germany possibly even free ? 
  every time i 've been to the netherlands i 've seen the french flag turned on its side . 
  it must be how the dutch insult people . 
  i 'm surprised at this . 
  i thought that , with relatively high income tax rates ( 20 % - 40 % i believe ? 
  ) , that healthcare is not entirely free or cheap . 
  what is the threshold for earnings to be entitled to a medical card ? 
  that 's true but when it 's all becoming like this , or at least really toned down , it gets boring . 
  charlie brooker is one of the only hopes i have got british comedy , but like you said , i 'm not sure the humour translates too well outside of the uk . 
  that must have cycled around because the words for roast and beef , in english , originate from old french . 
  aye that 's the one . 
  it seems from then on every network started to be careful . 
  well we allow israel to be in eurovision . 
  yes . 
  this has a lot to do with it . 
  i do n't know what happened but it seems people are more offended on other people 's behalf , which winds me up immensely . 
  did all this start with that russel brand and jonathan ross thing ? 
  in my option , the uk is really flopping with comedy these days . 
  everything popular is practically family friendly ; garbage like miranda . 
  i think comedy in the uk is losing its balls . 
  i see it all over on plaques in public places and on buildings when they have been supported by the eu . 
  i never see it actually flying , though . 
  i hope they do , too .
