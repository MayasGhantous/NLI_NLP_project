  i like germans and germany , and some of my all time favourite films are german . 
  we have a lot more in common that people choose to believe . 
  i think this outdated rivalry because of the war is in people 's heads ( this `` 2 world wars and 1 world cup '' nonsense is dying out , probably because england have a joke of a football team now ) . 
  however , on the surface it does look like germany is the `` leader '' of the eu and has the most influence . 
  it 's because , like you have found , our media plays on this . 
  being an island nation brits are quite picky with who they let in and when we see angela merkel allowing hundreds of thousands of refugees to settle in germany it pulls the image down even further ( just for clarity , i think what she has done was right and i actually like her ) . 
  you probably find the brits who do dislike germany for silly reasons are generally culture-phobic anyway . 
  the uk needs to wake up and stop thinking it is top dog in europe , because germany genuinely is both politically and financially . 
  i think people here perhaps get a little jealous . 
  i would care more if a battle began but it has n't . 
  putin has done one of those things that intelligent people do in an argument and is n't fighting back . 
  he said he wo n't expel any american diplomats from russia . 
  i do n't think putin 's relationship with trump is genuine . 
  i reckon that trump is being used . 
  i dislike trump and putin a great deal . 
  this is going to be fun to watch . 
   always talking about music the negative sentences are also confusing , stuff like : `` i trust nobody '' is sometimes `` i do n't trust nobody '' that 's because they 're wrong . 
  it 's not proper grammar to use a double negative like that . 
  you can use it to kind of `` cancel '' the negative out and produce a positive but people probably would n't do that unless they were trying to be smart . 
  `` i do n't trust nobody '' technically means `` i trust somebody '' so it should really be `` i trust nobody '' , `` i do n't trust anybody '' etc. 
  church attendance is in serious decline in the uk but i have been a few times for weddings and funerals . 
  i do n't go to family christenings because i disagree with them ; i know that my family are in no way religious so i have no idea why they get their children christened . 
  the services are usually generic . 
  they same something about the person who died or is getting married ( same thing ? 
  ) , sing a hymn , say some more , read a passage or two , prey , sing another hymn and so on . 
  i agree to a degree . 
  if they come from anywhere east of germany then the morons in this country would consider them as some kind of bad immigrant , whereas people from france , sweden , etc are fine . 
  i have lost count of the times i have heard people talk about brexit stopping muslims coming here and every time i just bang my head in shame . 
  reddit , at least this part of it and r/europe , are quite atheistic anyway . 
  i think there is a growing trend of people being non-religious to the point where christianity is dying in the west . 
  in the uk , for example , no religion is the second biggest claim after christianity , and even when choosing christianity i imagine a lot of people probably consider themselves that by the default of their family but are n't practising . 
  [ this one ] ( https://youtu.be/gp5yohqztla ) is definitely the all time top eurovision performance . 
  i 'm also wearing your cargo shorts right now . 
  i lived in manchester and i cycled everywhere , although some parts were scary because it was just road and no cycle path ( they seem to be sorting this out , thankfully ! ) . 
  cycling is not as popular in the uk as it is in other parts of europe , though . 
  where i work they have 6 cycle racks , but about 300 car park spaces . 
  i now live in a large town called ~ ~ hell ~ ~ middlesbrough and i walk to work . 
  my walk is 4km but i am sooooo bored of cycling and sitting down that i need to do it . 
  i do n't have a car ( i like the extra money i have every month ! ), 
  but if i did the journey is 20 minutes anyway and for 20 minutes extra i get exercise , fresh air and can listen to music in relative safety . 
  most people in my region drive to work or use public transport ( mainly the bus ) . 
  when i worked in leeds for a while i was in the city centre so i also walked . 
  were you genuinely curious to what interracial dating was like in europe or were you really here just to push this message ? 
  i ca n't speak for all of europe - i do n't think anyone can because most countries are different - but in the uk it 's not taboo . 
  people might make pointless comments and you might get some racist bigots but on a whole no one really cares . 
  i have no idea about how asian men are seen . 
  i do n't think there 's a general consensus on that . 
  it 's banned i 'm afraid . 
  i take the `` each to their own '' approach , where i do n't care if someone wants to be religious but i do n't want to be religious myself . 
  i do think religion is a really outdated concept shoved down people 's throats , though . 
  how can someone be brought up with one region then suddenly think that it 's all wrong and another religion is now the right one ? 
  i do think religion should be taught in schools , but not in the sense that it 's taught as factual or the way of life the pupils should live , but more so kids are aware of religion and what it 's about . 
  religion should be completely separate from government . 
  in the uk religion and state are not separate `` legally '' but in practicality they pretty much are ; it 's the church of england anyway , you could have a child with your sister and they 'd forgive you !, 
  i do n't think religion causes conflict . 
  people cause conflict . 
  religion is often the catalyst . 
  north korea is pretty much religion free but it still finds excuses to intimidate ( or try to ) . 
  religion is just a great tool for control and when you get people believing then you have control over them . 
  i consider myself atheist . 
  my mum bought me two books for christmas ; the origin of species and a brief history of time . 
  i think that sums up my `` religion '' . 
  in comparison to cars there 's only a small amount of motorcycles . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/vehicle-licensing-statistics-2013 ) is slightly outdated , from 2013 , but it shows against almost 30 million cars , there was around 1.3 million motorcycles . 
  i know quite a few people with bikes but they do n't ride them often . 
  it 's more of a hobby . 
  as a native english speaker things like that are completely natural but i think they are learned/memorised rather than understood . 
  i imagine the inconsistency in letter sounds in english is difficult . 
  you often just learn the word sound rather than how each letter sounds because they are different in some words . 
  you see scooters around but there not hugely popular . 
  the only place i have noticed a presence of them is in london , likely because driving a car in london is horrendous . 
  you see motorcycles now and again but again , they 're not hugely popular . 
  i personally see them more than scooters and you often get biker groups going on rides together . 
  i live in north yorkshire ( kind of ! ), 
  and i often see lots of motorcyclists gathered in smaller towns and villages in the region . 
  when gordon brown ( prime minister at the time ) [ called a bigoted woman `` a bigoted woman '' ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/29/gordon-brown-gillian-duffy-bigot ) . 
  it took over the campaign he was running and genuinely done damage to him . 
  it was n't the most controversial - it 's no `` grab them by the pussy '' - but it was blown out of proportion . 
  i have noticed a lot of other europeans use a mix of british and american words , but even us brits use a mix of those mentioned . 
  when i lived in the city centre i rented an apartment and called it an apartment ( it was called a `` luxury apartment '' , which is a stupid name for a flat with laminate flooring , kitchen in your living room and an en-suite the size of small wardrobe ) but i normally say flat . 
  i would always say lorry for one of [ these ] ( http://cdn1.itpro.co.uk/sites/itpro/files/lorry.jpg ) , but then truck for things like a pick-up-truck , toe-truck etc. 
  to let and for rents are used interchangeably , though to let sounds more like industry talk than general conversation . 
  compared to the usa , homes are definitely smaller . 
  that is owed to population density ( america has 318 million people and europe has 743 million , with europe being only slightly larger in area ) and it 's history . 
  like the usa bigger and more prosperous cities are more expensive and you get less for your money . 
  there are thousands of varieties , but it 's very common in the uk to have row/terrace houses or semi-detached houses or flats ( apartments ) like these examples below . 
  detached houses are common but not as common as they 're usually more expensive . 
  [ lower cost terraced houses ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/edith_avenue_in_moss_side.jpg ) , usually found in more industrial ( or former industrial ) towns , especially in the north of england . 
  you often see different coloured rows depending on the region , like west yorkshire often has sandstone coloured terraces , manchester has red ones and london has a kind of pale brown brick . 
  [ seaside terraces ] ( http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/a464a17ef5fd450ab6192e8f6b99c550/row-of-terraced-houses-belle-view-terrace-aberaeron-ceredigion-wales-e81ep1.jpg ) , often painted bright and found in a lot of seaside towns where they are on the seafront . 
  [ london terraces ] ( http://media.rightmove.co.uk/38k/37838/25488618/37838_che120081_img_00_0000.jpg ) , in london of course and very expensive ( the website this picture is from said the price is # 5million ! ), 
  [ new build terraces ] ( http://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/91k/90400/47386279/90400_5168166_img_00_0000_max_656x437.jpg ) , which , in my opinion , are unimaginative and ugly but these are springing up all over along with semi-detached ones in the same style . 
  [ common semi-detached ] ( http://www.heritageconnectlincoln.com/imggallery/big_2009_semi_detached_house1.jpg ) , found all over but features differ . 
  [ rural/village houses ] ( http://media.gettyimages.com/videos/village-with-stone-houses-castle-combe-cotswolds-wiltshire-uk-video-id103332040?s=640x640 ) are common outside of cities and almost exclusive to rural ares . 
  they 're usually really old and small in comparison to others . 
  i think these are the types people think all brits live in , but most people live in the others above . 
  [ scottish tenements ] ( http://cairnestateagency.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/housing-in-glasgow.jpg ) are more like rows of flats than houses , but you do n't find them elsewhere in the uk as much . 
  [ monstrosities like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/portsmouth_somerstown_council_flats.jpg ) often ruin british city skylines . 
  these are typically council/social landlord run flats . 
  lots of them have knocked down but they 're still everywhere , particularly in places like manchester , glasgow and london , but we tend to see apartments looking more like [ this ] ( http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/01/09/90/1099099_de5a8867.jpg ) these days .
