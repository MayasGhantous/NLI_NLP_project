  the only time it gave her attention was in paris when we were on the metro and some spanish women were obsessed with it , stroking her hair and saying `` rouge '' over and over ( appreciate that is french but they were clearly spanish ) . 
  it wo n't make you a target but anything bright makes people stand out . 
  the average wedding cost is something like # 20,000 , so if people want to spend that to save a few hundred pound a year then they 're silly ... of course , you could just get a quick wedding at a registry office . 
  marriage , in my opinion , is pointless these days . 
  perfectly comprehensible . 
  [ sorry danish people , but i just had to . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  white british people are the majority in london still . 
  45 % according to the last census , and 60 % of london is white . 
  the next closest is asian at around 20 % . 
  that 's probably the same here . 
  property is too expensive and people often find it hard to get one home let alone two . 
  the last one i lived in was from the early 1900s but i do n't know the exact date . 
  the current one i live in is from the 50s i believe . 
  even so , it 's clear that millions of people in the usa have german heritage . 
  i do n't think an official one exists . 
  there 's some on youtube but they 're all homemade . 
  i live in a town where the most fascinating thing is something called a [ parmo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parmo ) , which explains why you see a lot of fat people here . 
  it 's a great town . 
  i stayed in uppsala for 3 weeks in 2001 and i loved it . 
  i was there for walpurgis eve , which was fun , with the homemade boats falling to bits down the river . 
  i also pretended to get married to someone in a church in gamla uppsala , which did n't go down too well !, 
  i 'm far too hipster to have netflix . 
  it 's not vegan . 
  there are courses taught in english in countries where the language is not a global one , like sweden , netherlands etc but in places like germany or france they will be rare , although i believe they are becoming more common , particularly research areas . 
  i think you 'll need to do your own research and be realistic . 
  you 're not going to find it easy in germany but you might find it easier in the nordic countries . 
  as for applying for the air force , you 'll be at a major disadvantage against the locals applying , especially as they are likely to be a lot younger since they are already citizens and do n't have to wait . 
  also do n't just assume you can apply or citizenship . 
  there are lots of rules around that and you need to be a regular resident for x amount of years , usually 5 . 
  an alternative is if you have ancestry from certain countries you can apply that way ( but not all countries in europe offer this ) . 
  i believe that the largest ancestry group in the usa is german so it 's not really an issue he has german heritage . 
  in the uk , at least , no one cares about an american 's heritage . 
  if they 're american they 're american . 
  most americans have foreign ancestry , mainly from europe . 
  in the uk it 's a disadvantage to have children because it is really costly . 
  on top of that the days where the mum stays at home and dad goes to work are over , so people have less time and less money to bring up kids . 
  like much of europe the uk has an ageing population and people live longer . 
  consequently the retirement age is rising to 68 and will probably go up even further ( which is shit ! ) . 
  we need more kids to support the ageing population but people just are n't having them . 
  in saying that , there is absolutely no drive that i know about to promote having kids in the uk . 
  no one should feel guilty for what their ancestors done , unless you have the same views as them . 
  they 're everywhere in the uk . 
  suddenly [ deirdre barlow glasses ] ( http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/590x/deirdre-barlow-death-anne-kirkbride-553065.jpg ) are fashionable . 
  my town does n't care , but nearby ones do . 
  i live at the top of north yorkshire in england and a lot of towns in the area have restrictions even down to the colour of the bricks that can be used . 
  however , in larger towns and cities it does n't seem to be the case . 
  it 's more of a thing to protect rural areas . 
  i can only speak for the uk , and the answer is it depends . 
  there 's a lot of companies who are extremely professional and then some who are rubbish . 
  i 'd assume that if you 're applying in the us then the employees are mainly american and not from the companies respective home country . 
  in the uk there are an awful lot of companies with values which are just flowery and the only real care is money . 
  it 's a bit outdated . 
  i do n't know anyone who has carpet in their bathroom and i 've never lived anywhere like that . 
  it definitely was popular , though . 
  i think it 's a mix of a few things , maybe even going back to wwii . 
  brits actually have healthier teeth than much of the world , including the usa , but the emphasis was previously on oral hygiene rather than giving someone a smile like julia roberts . 
  generally , more kids get braces to fix their teeth before adulthood now . 
  in my school days people would n't get braces as much . 
  on top of that a lot of our politicians have crooked teeth - i honestly think that people from that breed of brits do n't care about how their teeth look - and some of our most famous people did ( david bowie being a good example ) . 
  brits do n't seem to spend thousands on getting a set of veneers like hollywood stars do , but that 's changing and we see a lot of `` hollywood '' teeth on tv and in films now . 
  things like the simpsons and austin powers do n't help !, 
  we use it to say `` fuck off '' . 
  angry people will say `` fuck off '' and stick two fingers up . 
  i really like swedish . 
  for a native english speaker from the north east of england i feel i have to put more power in when speaking swedish and put more emphasis on each word ( i done some basic lessons a long time ago when i visited for an exchange trip in college but all i can really do now is count and say a few words and phrases ) . 
  in english it 's easy for words to merge into each other . 
  in swedish the words seem to bounce around a bit more and the tone and pace goes up and down . 
  it 's quite obvious that someone is speaking swedish when i hear them . 
  one of my favourite bands are swedish - ~ ~ abba ~ ~ the knife - but they do n't really have much in the swedish language , other than a song they done called [ f\u00f6r alla namn vi inte f\u00e5r anv\u00e4nda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jmxzbpw-q0 ) but this is n't typical of their style .

  i always use wetwipes . 
  you get them in supermarkets for adults as well ... 
  they 're # 1 in sainsbury 's or something like 59p in aldi . 
  danish people , do you really have a hard time understanding each other ?

  we take a shower at least once a month . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ most ^ ^ ^ ^ people ^ ^ ^ ^ shower ^ ^ ^ ^ daily . 
  in one of my old jobs the intranet was called `` dave '' because that was the most common customer name . 
  also , there 's a tv channel called dave ( as you probably know ) because `` everyone knows a bloke called dave '' . 
  i thought it would be john . 
  i know about 30 johns ... and at my current job there 's a 4 tier hierarchy of johns from a staff member , a supervisor , a manager and a head of service . 
  i think abortion is fine for all reasons , even if the mother just does n't want a child . 
  religion should have absolutely nothing to do with someone if they do n't follow that religion . 
   there 's a lot of older people not comfortable with electronic communication so i have no problem with sending out letters . 
  that 's fine , and an example of when letters should be used . 
  i do n't visit the doctors often but i never request a letter but get it by default . 
  i actually got a letter telling me i am waiting for a letter and did n't quite understand why . 
  it 's definitely archaic , yes . 
  i assume that over the years a lot of bad habits have stuck and there 's information all over , with different trusts operating different ways and not using the same systems for everything . 
  i 've always had some kind of scales . 
  i have a cheap digital set now and it 's mainly used for weight rice , pasta etc. 
  so i get the right amount . 
  i rarely bake but almost all of my meals are from raw ingredients so i need to know what i am putting in . 
  some national health service offices are still paper based . 
  i was referred to another `` branch '' of the nhs recently and i had to fill in 4 pages with my personal details , my medical history , my gp address etc. . . all of which is clearly * somewhere * on their system . 
  doctors surgeries still send letter appointments out , despite having an online booking system . 
  what a waste !, 
  the only time the letter should be sent is if someone requests it ( e.g.
