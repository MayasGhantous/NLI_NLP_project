  proof for work ) . 
  people are becoming increasingly selfish so this allows the right to gain more popularity . 
  how long this resurgence lasts i do n't know but it 's obvious that parties that are further right than centre-right are gaining popularity . 
  in the uk there 's a strong ` look after your own ' mentality , and now we have brexit to deal with . 
  but then the same can be said about the other side . 
  i did n't say otherwise ... 
  i live in the uk so i know there 's millions of idiots here already . 
  i did n't buy the hype that a lot of americans were stupid ( there 's stupid people in every country ) but then nearly 50 % voted for trump . 
  the ones i know have became naturalised citizens because they lived somewhere long enough . 
  i do n't know anyone who has gained citizenship just from marriage . 
  growing up i thought america was like saved by the bell and sister sister . 
  then the internet came and i realised it was n't and there will always be an `` underclass '' in the usa regardless of who is on power . 
  trump is just a bigoted old man who wants more power and half of america believed him . 
  there 's videos of him contradicting a lot of the stuff he has recently said . 
  i know you are panning ahead but the negotiations have not yet started . 
  it may be that before a certain date british people who are settled in other eu countries and people living in the uk from other eu countries retain the right to live in that country . 
  i reckon there 's a strong chance of something along those lines , otherwise the uk will get back hundreds of thousands of pensioners from spain ( perhaps a slight exaggeration !, 
  they 're in that weird not-quite-europe-not-quite-asia zone ( i wonder if there 's a german compound word for that ? ) . 
  maybe just eurasian ? 
  welcome israel to europe . 
  we could just close most subs and refer people to google , but where 's the fun in that ? 
  humans are social . 
  we like to talk to each other . 
  that 's what reddit is about . 
  perhaps i should have said i would n't be unhappy if it was stopped . 
  it 's going to go to a vote in the uks parliament , which is part of the uks democratic process . 
  it varies across europe but generally europeans have free speech . 
  some countries have laws against bad hate speech . 
  we 'll rarely hear hate speech asking people to target minorities and bullying on social media is not accepted . 
  just because you respect something does n't mean you have to agree with it . 
  i respect people 's democratic rights but i do n't necessarily have to agree with what their opinion is . 
  it 's not democracy they hate , it 's the results . 
  i do n't want it to happen , but i respect it was voted for democratically . 
  i still want it stopped . 
  kind of . 
  i do n't care to the degree the british media seem to think we should but i care for the americans ( and non-americans ) who will get shit on because of him . 
  let 's hope this bigoted oap is all mouth and no action . 
  for the uk it might be a strange kid of blessing because , unlike obama , trump said he wo n't put the uk at the `` back of the queue '' following brexit so in a backhanded way the uk and usa might grow closer . 
  i just hope that does n't mean we 'll grow distant with europe . 
  honestly , how can a man who has such a foul mouth and disgusting views even be considered for president let alone be president ? 
  i just do n't know what half of america were thinking . 
  where in the west has an absolute monarchy ? 
  you mean you do n't schmoke pipes and eat pancakes ? 
  that 's hilarious !, 
  no one cares unless you make a big deal of it , or get really loud for no reason . 
  i 've never been anti-american and some of my favourite things are american ( hi reddit , hi google ) but i definitely have issues with some american politics and their influence in the world . 
  look at how much the world watched the recent election . 
  do america even care who won the uk election or who the leaders across the world are ? 
  the us election was headline news and news networks are still going on about it . 
  anyone know if there 's as much focus on international elections in the usa ? 
  i doubt there 'll be a conflict . 
  there might be ( or have been ? ), 
  more animosity between the nations but i do n't there would be a war . 
  the time i think there would be some kind of conflict is if russia decide to invade another part of eastern europe again . 
  to be fair some porn i 've seen from the czech republic has been crazy , like male twins having sex because it 's not illegal and orgies of all kinds . 
  when i say seen , i mean i 've came across ... and when i say came across i do n't mean from my happy bits !, 
  because we send the ones that are the biggest joke , like the competition . 
  it 's fun , though !, 
  they 're delicious !, 
  we definitely have them in the uk , too . 
   ukip had just 18 % support and managed to win 52 % in the brexit vote ukip were not even part of the official brexit campaign . 
  although that vile farage was an influence , brexit was n't a ukip thing . 
  of course , it fit perfectly with their manifesto and they got involved as much as possible . 
  the brexit campaign was vile sometimes , and clearly used the refugee crisis to it 's advantage . 
  if angela merkel is letting in 1million refugees what will happen to the uk ? 
  everyone panic !, 
  i wonder if people will feel the same in other countries when it 's their turn to go to the polls . 
  what 's scary is that parties like ukip have influence even though they are not in power . 
  i assume that is the same with front national and afd ? 
  it 's a crazy system , but as is the uks . 
  both countries are in the position where most people are against the leaders but they 're in power nonetheless . 
  is it like first past the post elections in the uk ? 
  it 's the party who win the most seats , or positions , rather than popular vote . 
  the current uk government only got around 32 % of the popular vote but won enough seats to have full control . 
  1 seat might have 100,000 people and another might have 30,000 for example ( completely made up figures ) . 
  also that our politicians all seem to have manky teeth . 
  maybe it 's an oxbridge thing . 
  is it not the eu he does n't like ? 
  it 's a power that can rival the usa . 
  however , it 's worrying when putin and farage ( uk independence party ) are singing his praise . 
  i have this awful feeling that the uk and usa will grow closer . 
  is it possible to go 80 on the m25 with the constant traffic ? 
  being english it 's quite difficult . 
  i was in germany once and a waiter commented in german on how english people always go red in the sun ( i was sunburnt - did n't expect that in berlin ! ), 
  and he never knew i could understand him . 
  he went a little red when i knew what he said . 
  there 's too many variations to list , and each country of the uk has it 's own system ( england and wales are more aligned , northern ireland has differences and scotland is very different ) , but a standard type in england would be split into key stages : before 5 there is no legal requirement for a child to be in education , but people do put their kids into early years education between 3-5 , and many schools have a nursery ( or similar ) for this . 
  ** 5 - 11 ** : primary school , split into 5-7 for key stage 1 and 8-11 for key stage 2 - colloquially known as infants and juniors ** 11 - 16 ** : secondary school , split 11-13 for key stage 3 , then 14-16 for key stage 4 , which includes gcses - colloquially known as seniors ** 16 - 18 ** : some kind of tertiary education , usually a college , high school or vocational training , key stage 5 . 
  at this stage pupils are free to choose what options they want but some form of education is compulsory until 18 . 
  typically people will do a levels , or something equivalent , here . 
  you generally need to fulfil some kind of criteria to get accepted onto a tertiary course , but it 's not unusual for people to re-take their gcse 's at a college if they failed . 
  after that pupils can go on to university , which is typically 3 years for a degree ( with some being more , such as medicine ) but university is not compulsory and , unfortunately , expensive now . 
  then a masters and phd if people get that far . 
  other variations include private schooling ( confusingly called public schools ! ), 
  and home schooling ... both usually for people with more money . 
  i wonder if such a poll has ever taken place ? 
  i imagine in most countries it would be extremely low figures if you 're talking global open borders . 
  i do n't know any russian people to have an opinion on them but i really do n't like the politics of the country . 
  from an outsider it seems the country is going backwards .
