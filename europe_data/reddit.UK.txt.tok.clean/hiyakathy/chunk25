  the newest 2 are not the best , but the ` middle ' ones like legend , anniversary and underworld are the best ones in my opinion . 
  they 'd mainly say that here as well , but if they want to emphasise that it 's going to be cooooolllld , they might drop in `` subzero '' or something along those lines, 
  i live in the north east of england and people use it here . 
  perhaps not all the time but it does get used . 
  does any other language have a version of antidisestablishmentarianism ? 
  we 'd call 0 \u00b0 c `` freezing '' , and colloquially we 'd say it was `` freezing '' when we are cold , but we 'd probably say something like `` subzero '' for anything colder than 0 \u00b0 c. 
  it 's not really used in day-to-day conversation but i often hear professionals ( maybe even weather presenters ? ), 
  say `` subzero temperatures '' . 
  the uk started using this as well , i assume adopted from ireland . 
  we call that `` smegma '' in english . 
  f\u00f6rl\u00e5t i see the flair on the mobile version properly . 
  of course you would n't have this anthology !, 
  did you have the red anthology in gcse english ? 
  this is thi six a clock news thi man said n thi reason a talk wia bbc accent iz coz yi widny wahnt mi ti talk aboot thi trooth wia voice lik wan na yoo scruff . 
  the perception in my part of the uk is that the usa think they `` won '' the war , probably because most war films made by hollywood says so ... but people here also think that the uk were actually the biggest influence . 
  of course , it was a joint effort and the ussr had a massive impact . 
  let 's just be thankful the people on the * right * side won . 
  there are no direct words for `` yes '' or `` no '' in irish . 
  it kind of works like `` are you coming ? '', 
  - `` i am coming '' or `` i am not coming '' . 
  the abuse of `` free speech '' . 
  it 's often used an an excuse to spread hate and allows people to verbally attack minorities without any consequences . 
  try christine and the queens . 
  she mixes english and french together ( she is french ) . 
  her original french album , chaleur humaine , is better than her newer version which replaces a few songs and replaces a lot of the french with english . 
  two of her most popular ones are [ saint claude ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzfymz2lft4 ) and [ christine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs40yxhjtxq ) ( re-released as tilted in english ), 
  oh , absolutely . 
  i have always praised french workers who have the guts to stand up for themselves . 
  in the uk companies do n't listen to strikers much now . 
  some do , but a lot do n't . 
  the company i work for went through big change with t&c s and people went on strike , but nothing at all happened and they implemented them anyway . 
  at least france cares . 
  in the uk people are armchair protesters . 
  they will get angry with the government but wo n't do anything about it other than moan . 
  but the main ones we hear about here are transport workers , mainly in london . 
  i 'm waiting for someone from france ... 
  i live in middlesbrough and i can get a return bus to newcastle for # 10 or less and it 's quicker than the trains , which are more expensive and really old . 
  buses are by far the easiest option in this region because rail is so underfunded and outdated . 
   church tax i did n't know such a thing existed but it seems a few countries in europe have a church tax . 
  it 's bizarre . 
  the uk is relatively good but there seems to be a lot less care for services being on time here than i 've experienced elsewhere . 
  london has the best transport in the country . 
  the tube is really efficient despite people giving it stick , but it does get crowded and it 's horrible at rush hour . 
  trains are ridiculously expensive , especially intercity ones that are n't booked months in advance . 
  i can fly to eastern europe cheaper than i can get a train 300km away . 
  when i go on holiday to europe , using a budget airline , my train fare to the airport is often more than the cost of the plane ticket . 
  some places , like london and manchester , have 24 hour public transport but many others people have to rely on taxis or driving themselves . 
  like many other areas it 's better in larger towns and cities . 
  if you 're rural then you 'll expect perhaps one bus an hour until 5pm and perhaps a one or two trains stop at the village station a few times a week , but other than that people who live in rural areas usually need a car . 
  yes , that 's right . 
  i forgot that it does n't work backwards like that . 
  most countries in europe are the size - or smaller - than us states . 
  in the uk , for example , you do n't need to travel for an hour to get to the city centre , unless you live in a rural area . 
  public transport is generally good despite what fellow brits might think . 
  i mean a `` severe delay '' on the london underground is 2 minutes . 
  i live in a large town of 170,000 people ( 350,000 in the urban area ) and i cycle most places . 
  i am never more than 30 minutes cycle from the main places i need to be . 
  however , taxis are relatively cheap here so if i get stuck i can pay around # 3 to get into the town centre . 
  i only live 2 miles away from it , though . 
  we have supermarkets everywhere , and most towns and cities have convenience stores dotted around in waking distance from most suburbs . 
  in saying that , most people will still use a car but it 's not a necessity . 
  uk : i do n't have enough energy to explain properly , but income tax starts once someone earns # 11,000 , then it 's taxed as below : # 11,001 to # 43,000 - 20 % # 43,001 to # 150,000 - 40 % over # 150,000 - 45 % that 's the general rule but there are loads of differences . 
  you also then pay national insurance , which is just another type of tax . 
  so $ 100,000 is roughly # 82,000 . 
  i could work it out but [ this ] ( https://listentotaxman.com/82000 ) does a much better job . 
  basically , out of the # 82,000 you 'd pass # 26,973 to the government , so you actually only take home # 55,026 . 
  we also pay taxes of , mainly , 20 % on most things we buy ( again , there 's loads of differences ) . 
  this is called vat but is included in the price in most places that the regular consumer uses . 
  if something is # 100 , then # 20 of that will go to the government - * edit : see post below for correction . 
  i visited lincoln recently and i was surprised at how nice it was . 
  i 've never really thought about lincoln before but it 's worth visiting . 
  i live within 30mins-60mins from a few medieval towns and cities , such as : ** york ** [ 1 ] ( http://www.docbrown.info/docspics/northern/p9158659.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/york.mstr..jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/micklegate_bar_%283%29.jpg ) ** durham ** [ 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/durham_school.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/durham_market_place.jpg ) . 
  [ 3 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/durham_castle_bergfried.jpg ) ** whitby ** [ 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/east_cliff.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0laguq_2asm/maxresdefault.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4873600664_b1903d9fc7.jpg ) my hometown , the dive known as middlesbrough , has some historic roots as it was settled by travelling monks , angles and vikings - it 's also where captain cook is from - but it was mainly developed from the industrial revolution . 
  most cities and larger towns in the north east have some kind of middle-age ( or before ) roots , as do many in the entire country , but i think those three above are more authentic and have had less development around the historic parts so they retain their look . 
  it 's believed to have came from a celtic harvest festival in parts of the uk , ireland and france ( celtic areas , basically ) . 
  even though it began here , in the uk now halloween is increasingly becoming americanised . 
  kids now say `` trick or treat '' which is relatively new to the uk , and people dress up as superheroes , fairies etc , which is also relatively new since it used to be ghosts , witches etc , although many people still do that . 
  it 's very hard to do that in the uk because it has over 6,000 islands . 
  i 've been to both of the major ones if that counts ( ireland and britain ) . 
  i 'm a big fan . 
  i have both the uk and french releases and i 'm seeing her live next week . 
  she is big in the uk after she played glastonbury . 
  same here in the uk ( and i believe most of the commonwealth and ireland ) . 
  it 's very rare that a non english song ( lyrically , anyway ) does well in the uk . 
  there 's the odd track that makes it but it 's uncommon . 
  the uk is rubbish with foreign languages . 
  christine and the queens is a good example . 
  her songs are mainly in english but there 's also some french on her album and it got to number 2 , but if it was all french it would have gone unnoticed . 
  i went to uni in manchester and there was a few scottish people who were 17 . 
  i always found that strange . 
  they still came out and got pissed with us , though !, 
  there 's some level of devolution coming to many english regions but nowhere like what scotland or northern ireland have . 
  there was a referendum for a north east assembly but it went heavily in favour of a no vote . 
  i want devolution to a degree because what 's good for the south east may not be good for the rest of the country . 
  you 're lucky to have so much devolution . 
  i 'm jealous of scotland . 
  i live in north east england and we get all the shit westminster throw at us with hardly any say . 
  yes , i am . 
  it did n't come to me that it 's not the same in all the countries .
