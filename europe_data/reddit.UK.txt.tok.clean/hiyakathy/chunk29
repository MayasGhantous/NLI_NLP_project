  it 's not solely to blame but the constant invasions in the hope of democracy has wound up terrorist groups . 
  i do n't know many people who hate america . 
  some of the policies the government have and some of the culture are often frowned upon but there 's not really any anti-american sentiment . 
  this happened all too often in the uk , from the 60s to 80s . 
  those eras ruined british skylines . 
  where the building is there used to be classic buildings but they were knocked down , as we 're quite a few to build the motorway . 
  since i live on an island ( the uk ) the only real option is plane . 
  i can get a train to france and drive from there but it 's so much longer that way . 
  indeed . 
  i did n't know she had those policies but they are scary . 
  google will be allowed to take over even more of the world !, 
  when i was at college we were learning about early tv politics . 
  my lecturer suggested that kennedy won the election because he looked and sounded better on tv , rather than because his policies were better . 
  most people here will talk about yearly and monthly salaries . 
  almost everyone i know will talk about yearly salaries , and other people can roughly work out what it is monthly anyway . 
  people still get paid weekly but that 's usually only for certain industries and more likely in things like agency and casual work . 
  a lot of places are converting to monthly , too . 
  the minimum wage in the uk is # 7.20 ( $ 8.30 ) an hour , which is # 252.00 ( $ 292.00 ) for a 35 hour week , or # 13,104 ( $ 15,155 ) a year . 
  this is also why the uk would never join ( and wo n't be able to soon , of course ) . 
  only the uk and denmark have opt-outs of the euro and every other member is legally obliged to join ( but keep making it possible not to join ) . 
  the advantage of a monetary union is strength in numbers , but the disadvantage is your weakest link can have negative effects on the rest of the union . 
  another problem with joining the eurozone would be that it 's probably going to be much more difficult to leave the eu if the country decided it needed to . 
  they 're sensible rules . 
  skyscrapers look horrible in historic regions . 
  america might get away with it since pretty much everything is new ( in european standards , anyway ) but attractive , old european towns get spoiled with big blocks . 
  then some things just look completely odd , like the [ turning torso ] ( http://architectism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/turning-torso-malmo-1.jpg ) in malm\u00f6 or [ beetham tower ] ( http://kaytons.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_3070.jpg ) in manchester . 
  in some areas , like [ la d\u00e9fence ] ( http://www.melia.com/en/hotels/france/paris/melia-paris-la-defense/img/meliaparisladefense-carrusel1.jpg ) in paris or the [ frankfurt skyline ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/skyline_frankfurt_am_main_2015.jpg ) they look good though . 
  [ this monstrosity ] ( http://i4.gazettelive.co.uk/incoming/article2997813.ece/alternates/s1200/middlesbroughjpg.jpg ) - it 's called centre north east and is mainly empty . 
  it 's 71m . 
  it 's the tallest building in the north east of england . 
  it used to have big pink lights on it which could be seen miles away , but since there 's hardy any companies in there they turn them off now ( probably to save money ) . 
  there 's plans to renovate it but it is still ugly . 
  the council decided to knock down loads of lovely old buildings and allow this monster to be built , along with [ demolishing old buildings and allowing a motorway ] ( http://i2.gazettelive.co.uk/incoming/article8971771.ece/alternates/s1227b/js58469012.jpg ) to run right through the centre of the historic area !, 
  the council are less shit these days and try to preserve history . 
  middlesbrough , armpit of the uk . 
  i 've been to uppsala on an exchange trip ( 15 years ago now ! ), 
  and we were told no building in the city is allowed to be taller than the cathedral . 
  is that true ? 
  i do n't follow it to the point where i know the ins and outs but trump definitely looks like the worst of the two . 
  hillary is the best of a bad bunch . 
  american politics are weird in the run up to an election . 
  they 're like celebrity popularity contests . 
  i do n't think there is a monthly or even weekly minimum wage . 
  if you work 4 hours a week you ca n't expect to earn the same as someone who works 35 hours on minimum wage . 
  however , you may get benefits if you earn a low wage , which you could look at being a minimum income . 
  in the uk , for example , people who earn less than a certain figure get top ups from the government for rent , council tax , living costs etc. 
  i think other counties have similar things . 
  some counties are trialling ( or now have ? ), 
  a basic income for everyone . 
  if you work 100 hours a month you need to be paid 100x minimum wage . 
  anything less is illegal in countries that have minimum wage systems . 
  no government top up compensates for it . 
  are n't some countries purposefully not meeting certain criteria to actively avoid joining the eurozone ? 
  why is this ? 
  scotland 's nationalism is left wing nationalism , though , not the right wing type people usually refer to . 
  snp are nothing like ukip , for example . 
  i doubt scotland will become independent any time soon . 
  the snp have most control in scotland because labour ran a weak election and had a poor candidate for prime minister and scotland would never have a majority of people vote for the tories ( the lib dems were a no hope ) , and nicola sturgeon is a decent politician , but has an obvious agenda . 
  manchester , uk has a great one . 
  it 's probably quite underrated internationally . 
  there was no recession and the outlook has been improved , so the brexit vote did n't cause the doom and gloom people expected . 
  we 'll have to wait until the actual brexit to see what will happen . 
  the uk has it the other way around . 
  if you hear the word asian you usually think of the middle east , india and such areas . 
  it probably because the uk has a relatively high population of people from india and pakistan . 
  people from the far east are seldom described as `` asian '' in general conversion and people would more likely just say `` chinese '' , `` japanese '' or wherever the person is from . 
  there 's been way too much negative reporting around free movement that it 's got a bad name in the uk . 
  we 're always hearing about eastern europeans coming here and claiming benefits and working for dodgy bosses who pay less than minimum wage . 
  in reality there 's * lots * of people from the eu working in the uk and providing a service legitimately but the tiny number of cases that look bad get all the press . 
  also people are stupid enough to believe that free movement means that people from the middle east can somehow just come to the uk with no restrictions . 
  someone on another sub ( i think the uk one ) said her street was becoming like a scene from karachi so she voted to leave the eu . 
  how stupid is that ? 
  the uk is just leaning back to the right and has always had a sense of `` look after your own '' . 
  it 's partly the government 's fault with their austerity measures . 
  i have seen the worst driving in paris out of anywhere i have been in europe . 
  everyone is so angry and there does n't seem to be much logic in it . 
  visit the arc de triomphe at a busy time and it 's chaos . 
  the singer from die antwoord adopted a kid and called him tokkie . 
  i know afrikaans is not dutch but it 's close so i wonder if their kid is essentially called `` chav '' ? 
  or possibly a spider according to google images !, 
  we 're alike in so many ways . 
  edit : the uk and ireland , not that woman an i !, 
  where do i buy kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 ? 
  i live in a dive called teesside and it 's more of a hybrid accent . 
  imagine if a geordie moved to north yorkshire and spoke with a similar pace and tone to a scouser ? 
  that 's what my accent sounds like we get called smoggies because of the history of the region being heavily based on industry . 
  ( geordie = newcastle , scouser = liverpool ) . 
  historically it 's influenced by north eastern accents , which are descended from anglo-saxons . 
  apparently the north east england accent sounds closer to old english than most other areas , but that 's because we 're backwards here . 
  the teesside accent is probably influenced by irish a little bit , too . 
  most people outside of the north east and north yorkshire think we are geordie . 
  it is like a softer geordie accent but we do n't really have as many colloquialisms . 
  we 'd rarely say things like `` gan '' for * go * , for example . 
  we will change words and to other people it may seem weird , like `` show us that '' really means * show me that * . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu5l9rioaqw ) is a bit of a joke with the accent , which made national news !, 
  i honestly think they guy was taking the piss but realistically it 's how people here speak . 
  i am guilty to some extent but mainly it 's dropping the t in words like butter and water . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yphulgkzmii ) is more like what people sound like here . 
  you find a new accent every 20 minutes drive in the uk . 
  it 's crazy .
