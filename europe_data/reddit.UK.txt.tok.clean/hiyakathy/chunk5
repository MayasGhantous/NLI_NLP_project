  the only russians i 've met were visiting manchester for a football match and they were unbelievably loud . 
  then again , brits are the same abroad . 
  we have that here but it 's not common . 
  it 's probably because we are experts at queueing in the uk . 
  it 's a national sport . 
  british people are really whiney and complain about the most minor of things . 
  i really like icelandic and when icelandic people speak english it 's lovely . 
  i 've just realised i do n't really like the sound of non-european languages . 
  maybe japanese but it 's probably because it 's the one i 'm most familiar with . 
  probably because the alt-right sub got closed down . 
  most of them are former colonies and still part of the commonwealth so we 're still quite close . 
  we clearly have a close political relationship to the usa but i feel the cultural one is closer to ireland , australia and new zealand . 
  canada is somewhere in between . 
  i want to stay . 
  you will generally find support for the eu on this sub and r/europe , though . 
  we talk about annual salaries in the uk . 
  the average is a around # 27,000 ( around $ 31,000 ) . 
  after tax this works around # 1,800 ( $ 2,100 ) per month . 
  if anyone pays into a pension or has a student loan they they earn less , of course . 
  talking about average salary is difficult to compare between nations because cost of living is different all over . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/19/5-facts-about-the-muslim-population-in-europe/ ) is a handy map , which shows that islam is still a minority religion in almost all of europe . 
  i guess it 's still debatable whether the transcontinental countries are european , asian on eurasian ... 
  when people think of modern day islam they look to the middle east where it 's practised most , and some of those countries operate regimes that are clearly backwards ( human rights are terrible in those places , especially for women and minorities ) . 
  islam is also seen as repressive . 
  as much of europe is opening up in terms of gay rights , women 's rights , rehabilitation etc etc etc it seems countries where islam is dominant are really lagging behind . 
  on top of that the number of terrorist attacks - some sensationalised in the media - in the name of islam have obviously had an impact . 
  this is why people probably see islam as a `` lesser '' religion and i do n't see it being accepted by the masses as a european religion . 
  those are not necessarily my views , just observations . 
  can i get back to you in 2 years ? 
  on my mobile , usually from google news . 
  is n't it pretty important that people learn the latin alphabet because of the internet ? 
  website addresses were almost always in the latin script , but it 's now possible to use other scripts ( not sure how popular this is now ? ) . 
  as far as i have seen keyboards in counties that use other scripts also have a latin script on them . 
  i know people from greece often `` latinise '' their text when typing online , where they type in greek but with latin characters . 
  i think , for the west at least , the european refugee crisis and recent terrorism has allowed more `` further '' right wing politics to grow . 
  i do n't think it 's fascism like we 've seen before wwii but there are elements . 
  i do n't think we 'll see things like muslim businesses being taken over by the us government , like we did with jewish ones and the nazis . 
  the english language is a bit of a hybrid one . 
  it is a germanic language , strictly speaking , but there 's a huge influence from french and latin to the point where nearly half of english is made up of romance words and only around 1/4 made up of germanic words . 
  we have tablespoon which is compounded , but we would n't have a butterknife , we 'd have butter knife instead . 
  then we have can not but we would never have willnot . 
  then we have silly things like would not = would n't , but will not = wo n't and not `` will n't '' . 
  german is quite a logical language , but english is just all over the place . 
  i 've never agreed with conscription and thankfully the uk does n't have it . 
  we have enough 17 year olds blinded by a # 1,000 a month wage joining the army already . 
  as for pension age , i totally agree with harmonisation between men and women . 
  women tend to live longer yet pension age for them is often lower . 
  in the uk it was ( and still is for a handful of people ) 61 for women and 65 for men . 
  it is currently being changed so men and women work until the same age and it is increasing to 68 ( for anyone currently under 52 years old ) . 
  i reckon it will end up going up to 70 for younger people . 
  that 's for the state pension , anyway . 
  you can retire and claim a private pension at 55 in the uk , but more ca n't afford that luxury so end up working into their mid/late 60s . 
  theresa may laughing off the sensationalist media questioning if we 'd go to war with spain was just a front and we really know spain are preparing for [ round 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/invincible_armada.jpg/300px-invincible_armada.jpg ) . 
  they could n't overthrow elizabeth i so they 'll try the older and more fragile elizabeth ii . 
  i do n't know many people in the uk who care about gibraltar . 
  if it was handed to spain tomorrow no one would care other than those in gibraltar , who it obviously matters to more . 
  the same can be said about most british overseas territories . 
  nope , it was real . 
  it was on channel 4 , who are a bit more daring . 
  it was a ridiculous idea , though . 
  we still have the after effects from the victoria era , but generally people do n't care too much . 
  the problem with the uk is we have a lot of whinging people who complain about anything so media outlets have to pander to them . 
  i experienced an earthquake in manchester about 10 years ago . 
  i thought someone was under my bed kicking it . 
  earthquakes are rare in the uk but we get relatively mild tremors sometimes . 
  nowhere competes with london but if london was to somehow perish then i 'd choose manchester . 
  i normally see 0,5 and 0,3 in most of europe . 
  in the uk our closest would be to order a pint or a half . 
  we 'd just say `` half a guinness '' for half a pint of guinness , for example . 
  yes , it 's allowed in the uk as well . 
  as long as the kid gets a full time education there 's no real restrictions . 
  i think the government/council would step in if it was found to be teaching extremism , but otherwise homeschooling for all kinds of reasons is allowed , such as religion , cultural beliefs etc. 
  i hate that . 
  so far i 've noticed that in germany , poland and france cars are allowed to turn right when then green man is signalling for pedestrians to cross . 
  it seems a bit dangerous . 
  i was in krak\u00f3w last week and nearly got hit , albeit by a slow moving car , because the views of the crossing was obscured by a building . 
  nothing will change directly , but they may be indirectly affected by things like the value of the pound ( they use the manx pound ) and if the common travel area will still be a thing ( which i think it will but i obviously do n't know the logistics of the irish and northern irish border ) . 
  i guess the issue with the pound will be applicable to other crown dependencies that use it . 
  we have a few here , at least what i have seen . 
  we have stereotypes of crazy `` red neck '' americans who are racist and a bit over the top with their views . 
  then we get the smiley , loud , happy ones with huge smiles and big white teeth , who are usually nice people but are a little bit generic and exhausting after a while . 
  there 's also the ones who are pretty much like us , only with a different accent ( these tend to be from the north east by the looks of it ) . 
  then there 's the land of extreme ones , such as fit , attractive , muscular men and then unhealthy , morbidly obese , unattractive men who we see in memes where they 're on a mobility scooter in walmart . 
  the uk media is almost exclusively made up of british and american stuff ( films , tv , music etc ) and we have the same stuff as you guys only we drive on the other side of the road and use the pound . 
  we definitely do n't get some things about your culture , like gun laws , circumcision and not being able to drink until you 're 21 ( whaaaat ?!? 
  s brits get pissed when we 're in the womb ! ) . 
  your government is a different story , but on a whole i do n't think we find americans too bad . 
  the internet might disagree , but everyone hates america on the internet . 
  the uk and , erm ... erm ... 
  i think it can be used as a pro-sentence , where it implies a longer sentence . 
  replying to a question and answering `` yes '' . 
  but that 's cheating slightly . 
  in school i was taught to remember it as '' ** r ** ichard ** o ** f ** y ** ork ** g ** ave ** b ** attle ** i ** n ** v ** ain '' - red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , violet . 
  but people will still refer to that song `` i can sing a rainbow '' , which i guess fits with the colours only not in the correct order . 
  i mean if you really want to get all pretentious and sciency , then there 's as any colours in a rainbow as your eyes can see . 
  humans can see up to 10 million different colours ... that would make a lovely acronym . 
  it wo n't surprise me . 
  commercial tv may struggle a lot going forward because adverts online do n't pay much anymore unless you 're a huge youtube star . 
  in saying that , i 'd gladly pay # 8 a month for something like all 4 if it increased its catalogue . 
  the bbc is often seen as one of the best broadcasters in the world .
