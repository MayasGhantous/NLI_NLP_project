  it 's way more efficient than locking them up honestly . 
  or at the very least , let the right type of muslims in so idiots do n't end up sympathising with freaks like isis . 
  like in california , most of the muslims are iranian exiles who hate the theocratic regime there , so if you 're a muslim who goes to one of their mosques you really are n't going to be radicalised into the idea that sharia is a great idea -- pretty much the opposite . 
  you really do n't understand ... ? 
  china does n't care about people or human life in general . 
  this is pretty much how it 's always been in china and the core view on humanity has not really changed much . 
  they hardly help their own poor unless it interests the people in beijing ; why would you expect anything but exploitation in africa ? 
  remember , the central mythic hero figure in china is also the biggest mass murderer in human history . 
  it 's not really a washington or mandela ... 
   they insinuate something the stupid right-wing voter accepts as a truth okay but we are n't that stupid so i do n't see what the problem is ? 
  he 's not demagoguing to far-right supporters here so i 'm pretty sure people understand that belgium is n't an islamic state . 
  people do the same thing when they describe big american cities too btw -- look at how everyone talks about detroit . 
  they leave out how there is a huge sprawling suburbia full of rich white people with no crime , so the metro detroit area is actually not a modern-day hellhole like it 's depicted . 
  yes and this is one of the biggest problems . 
  the euro is a currency regulated by a weak central government , something that has never really happened before . 
  and it brings with it a number of fairly major problems , the biggest one being that currency valuation is done purely at the whim of only those states which benefit from cheap money . 
  for the importers and less wealthy states in the euro , this is a disaster since it means everything they need costs more . 
  it 's good that the eu redistributes some wealth true , but it does not come even close to what the us federal government does among its states ( for obvious reasons , try being a politician in germany or the uk and convincing your people it 's a good idea to send their money abroad ) . 
  and that redistribution is not done with social considerations in mind , but rather economic -- farm subsidies and the like account for the bulk of payments . 
  these are definitely helpful if done properly , but they hardly address the big issue of costs . 
  lovely fellow are n't you ? 
  and nope , i do n't live in the uk anymore and i never moved there in the first place . 
  this may shock you , but people do n't really get to choose where they 're born . 
  i know , mind blown . 
  we make french jokes for historical reasons , but that 's about it . 
  nobody actually looks down on the french , not even british nationalists . 
  hell , most of our grandfathers fought to defend france and huge numbers of our countrymen died in france defending the french people . 
  you do n't do that for people you hate . 
  it 's like a sibling rivalry -- you do n't outwardly get along and you constantly belittle each other , but ultimately your little brother is still one of the people you trust and care most about . 
  it 's not an india-pakistan sort of thing . 
  '' ... these tigers are known for their excellent ability to stalk their prey . 
  any questions ? '', 
  `` yeah , where 's hitler buried ? '', 
  but really , asking that question near the burial sites of previous german leaders is probably the best place to do it . 
  honestly i ca n't think of anywhere else that would be more appropriate . 
  you 're looking at my criticism of european reactions in a european forum and applying an american perspective to it . 
  i do n't really know what else to do . 
  i mean , we probably do n't actually disagree on much but your input seems kinda irrelevant or just `` out there '' . 
  also originally i thought you were a european because you do n't have any flair ( fix that !, 
  the catalyst was the banking sector , but the reason the problem persisted were systemic . 
  hopefully you noticed the role huge cash transfers from richer ez members ( mostly germany ) to poorer ones played in ending the chaos . 
  those sorts of cash transfers are a regular thing in other fiscal unions , not one-off emergency measures . 
  in the us this is the primary purpose of the federal government collecting taxes from the states -- it redistributes money constantly to the less productive members of the union so that the more productive ones can continue their level of success . 
  otherwise , the poorer states would have to somehow gain control of their currency to control prices . 
  this is the biggest flaw in the euro , but it can be fixed . 
  the banking crisis was a separate issue that exposed weaknesses , but it is n't * the * underlying problem . 
  in the us the banking hit was ** far ** bigger than anywhere in europe , but they were in recession for only one quarter at which point they had growth . 
  here we had a much longer recession and eventually a double-dip ( the second one having nothing to do with banks ) . 
  nope , it looks like well over a thousand now : en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_pro-russian_unrest_in_ukraine damn . 
  i had no idea . 
  no because like i said , context matters . 
  nobody in the uk or us has any doubt as to who the enemy in wwii . 
  there 's no ambiguity or implication that poland was involved in the camps . 
  if anything , public perception goes the other way in that people place all the blame on germany without acknowledging the role austrians , italians , swiss , arabs , and many eastern europeans ( including some poles ) played in wwii atrocities . 
  when you say cuban detention camp , most people would assume it was run by cubans , mostly because cuba is a communist dictatorship and guantanamo is n't even close to as notorious as any concentration camp . 
  there 's a difference . 
  oh , and people call them the nyc attacks or wtc attacks all the time . 
  nobody goes on to assume local nyers were hijacking their own planes . 
  same for the mumbai attacks , london attacks , madrid attacks , etc. 
  good one !, 
  he 's british so he must be an imperialist !, 
  argument won !, 
  not that it matters , but my ancestors were colonial subjects of the british empire , not the other way around . 
  ok but that 's what i spoke about and you replied to me . 
  if you want to change the topic fine , but make a new comment thread . 
  got ta say , if you apply this same logic everywhere the world would be a horrific place to live in . 
  i hardly think people in the balkans would agree . 
  are the hindus or ahmadis or shias going to head back to pakistan soon ? 
  what about those iranian jews and sunnis , those saudi shias , i could go on forever but i think i 've made my point . 
  i have no idea how your mind works but it 's honestly quite confusing . 
  this is / r/europe ... 
  i 'm sure it 's different in the us ; you do n't have a large muslim population and your political left is not really left by our definition . 
  but here bashing israel is a regular thing , while for the rest of the year people pretend nothing bad is happening in the me . 
  nobody even suggests we do anything to prevent the atrocities that constantly take place , and which are ** far ** worse than anything israel does . 
  they 're all bad guys . 
  why people in the west think they should or can take sides is beyond me . 
  this is n't slut shaming ... and it was a joke . 
  not sure germany is a great example ... well-assimilated sure , but after wwii that was sort of done and the fact that so many fled to israel makes perfect sense . 
  would you have tried to rebuild your life in germany ( or poland , or france , or italy , etc. 
  only something like 15 % of americans did n't have health coverage before the obamacare bill passed . 
  now almost 100 % do . 
  i live in the us for most of the year ; i 'm not that poorly informed . 
  that 's what they say out loud . 
  does n't make it true !, 
  the british empire broke up even more recently than that . 
  does the uk have a claim over the world 's anglo-saxons ? 
  because tripling our economy would be great if so . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  yes but why do we accept that ? 
  why take israel 's word and nobody elses ? 
  i mean , iran claims its a democracy as does egypt , saudi arabia claims it respects human rights , hamas claims it is not a fascistic terrorist organisation , etc. 
  we all know those claims are complete and utter bs so why do we pretend israel 's are n't ? 
  and if we accept that israel is not really a liberal democracy , then surely we can also see the bigger picture , right ? 
  i mean , i think it 's a borderline apartheid state , but it 's also objectively true that they kill fewer muslims than almost every country surrounding it . 
  it 's also objectively true that they 've granted more palestinian arabs citizenship and rights than any country but jordan , and they 've killed far fewer palestinians than almost all of their neighbours . 
  they do n't respect human rights , but they respect it far more than saudi arabia , iran , iraq , kuwait , qatar , bahrain , egypt , syria , etc. 
  so why the double standard ? 
  how is it reasonable for the un to waste years voting to condemn israel and ignoring so many examples of even worse suffering ? 
  the anti-israel protesters largely do n't care at all about humanitarianism and are n't actually concerned with innocent civilians dying ; they are concerned with innocent civilians dying to israeli arms . 
  if they were not , they would have been protesting for years non-stop now .
