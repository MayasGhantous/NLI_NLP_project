  look at any historical trend line of per capita gdp and you 'll notice a huge surge right around the time market economics and democracy began to take hold around the world . 
  we now live in the least regulated era and the average human has a far better life than ever before . 
  the only real historical argument that government should play a role in the economy is actually fairly recent , mostly during the industrial revolution through the mid-20th century . 
  so while your basic argument is fine , making appeals to history makes no sense in backing it up . 
  history as a whole shows us that we should keep government out of markets , recent history shows us that government still has a vital role to play and it should n't be completely removed . 
  they 're heavily influenced by the european enlightenment and historical christianity . 
  that 's about as broad a description as you can have that still does a good job distinguishing the `` west '' from the east , middle east , africa , etc. 
  a lot of societies do n't really accept individualism , secularism , democracy , and other post-enlightenment ideas as much as european states do . 
  do n't kid yourself . 
  almost none of those idiots are even from gaza and none of them have any stake whatsoever in the conflict there . 
  normally that 's perfectly fine -- i get upset about things that i have no stake in too . 
  but i do n't somehow get angry enough to turn into some uncivilised criminal and i have no idea why these fools do . 
  english-speaking ? 
  anglo has a racial element to it that does n't make much sense given the demographic makeup of north america . 
  that 's what i was hoping but he ended up going to prison for trying to join al-shabab so i guess not . 
  idk , those idiots in paris come to mind though . 
  i doubt anti-semitic islamists are unaware what hamas stands for . 
  they just agree with them and nothing is going to change their minds . 
  but those leftists who blindly support a group whose beliefs are nearly the opposite of what they themselves believe are frustrating and completely useless in actual peace efforts . 
  yeah and i 'm not actually accusing you of anything to be clear , so if i came you that impression sorry . 
  but people like those in the op who just blindly support `` the palestinians '' are oftentimes far too ignorant when it comes to just who exactly they are backing . 
  this is n't a conflict with a good side and a bad side , it has several layers of good and bad all over the place . 
  for every anti-israeli/idf slogan protesters on the street chant there should be two anti-hamas ones . 
  except not a single person at any protest i 've seen said a negative word about hamas whatsoever , despite their central role in causing the carnage in the first place and their near-constant guilt in the deaths of thousands upon thousands of their fellow palestinians over the years . 
  people say they care about the palestinian people and then give a free pass to people responsible for killing so many of them . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  ... what ? 
  no of course not , but it still does not absolve hamas of any of the guilt . 
  they are the ones doing the most to slaughter innocent palestinians here by deliberately pursuing a strategy that gets their people killed . 
  contrast that to the west bank , where the people are not being massacred right now . 
  why ? 
  because the pa is n't wantonly attacking israelis nor is it using civilians as shields . 
  every single pro-palestinian person in the world ( myself included ) should despise hamas as much if not more than the idf . 
  ok but then you 're absolving hamas of any guilt here , and turning a blind eye to their willful provocations against israel . 
  obviously israel deserves a lot of the blame they get , but you can not pretend the palestinians are behaving in a purely righteous way and being brutalised for nothing . 
  the government of the gaza strip explicitly states its goal is to kill as many jews as possible and then constantly launches rockets into israeli civilian territory . 
  obviously there is going to be a response . 
  the real issue at hand is the severity of that response , and more importantly israel 's behaviour toward the west bank ( which is almost always overshadowed by those idiots in gaza ) . 
  there are no settlements in gaza and israel withdrew all its troops in 2005 ; the biggest obstacle to them doing the same in the wb is hamas ' belligerent nonsense . 
  abbas even said the same himself ... 
  ehh , not sure this makes sense at all even though your heart is in the right place . 
  for one , there are no settlements in gaza nor have their been any israelis there for years -- the west bank has those legitimate grievances you mention but they are n't trying to attack israel . 
  instead the pa is doing the responsible thing ( unlike hamas ) and actually participating in negotiations ( which yes , the israelis are trying to tank because they 're assholes ) . 
  this is obviously far preferable to starting a war you can not win and which will cost your own people dearly . 
  if i 'm wronged by mike tyson , i do n't go punch him in response -- that 's beyond stupid . 
  it 's also worth noting that the whole notion of genocide and how israel wants to eliminate the palestinians is just dead wrong . 
  obviously i 'm not sympathetic to israel ( honestly i consider myself fairly neutral , but anti-hamas and somewhat pro-pa ) , but it still needs to be said the under israeli occupation the palestinian population has actually grown massively . 
  it 's hard to call it a genocide or argue their goal is to get rid of the palestinians when they 've actually presided over the largest period of palestinian population growth in history . 
  factual accuracy is important if there 's ever going to be honest deliberation and long-term peace . 
  also they are n't trying to kill israelis really . 
  hamas ' goal here is to kill palestinians , indirectly through an israeli response . 
  it 's the only card they have left , now that they 've lost virtually all their allies outside gaza . 
  in the last few years they lost the support of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf monarchies ( qatar somewhat excepted , although the new emir is n't too enthusiastic about supporting them ) , and iran , iraq and syria because they are sunni and took the sunni 's side in the conflict over there . 
  they have n't even been able to pay any of their 40000 employees ' salaries for months . 
  their only card left is to do something to galvanise the islamic world and hope that maybe someone will come help them in some form . 
  and that means provoking israel and getting a lot of palestinians killed on purpose . 
  this is n't even some secret -- the palestinian authority and egyptian foreign ministry have basically said this is what hamas is trying to do . 
  it 's fucked up . 
  hamas claims to represent the people it kills for its own benefit while israel shows an inhuman lack of restraint and keeps moving further and further to the right . 
   well , that 's my point : they can do it , but they are n't doing it . 
  by continuining this way , they are actively creating their own future ( and current ) problems . 
  yes , but at the same time why would you expect them to do it if literally the last time they did it not even a decade ago , within only a year a terrorist group took power and immediately began launching rockets at them ? 
  i mean , even if i was the most dove-ish israeli i would be worried about withdrawing from the west bank given that the last two times israel withdrew from places -- south lebanon and gaza -- terrorists took over and attacked israel from those very locations . 
  it 's such a clusterfuck really because the logic goes that if israel withdraws , terrorists attack israel , so israel wo n't withdraw , which causes more resentment and more terrorists who want to attack israel . 
  catch-fucking-22 for everyone involved . 
  sorry what ? 
  are you associating those murderers with the anc and mandela ? 
  they 'd be pretty upset at if you said that to their face . 
  i do n't hold individual palestinians accountable for actions they may take out of anger at the occupation -- that is to be expected and obviously israel needs to understand that not every act of violence deserves a heavy-handed response as they 've brought a great deal of it on themselves . 
  but hamas is a government organisation . 
  it is n't just some group of locals who hate israel , it is the self-proclaimed official authority of the gaza strip . 
  i and everyone else should expect them to behave in a much more responsible way , which means ** not ** striving to exterminate your neighbour ( * especially * if said neighbour is far more powerful than yourself ) and ** not ** using your people as a propaganda point . 
  there is no doubt in anybody 's mind that hamas ' primary goal in this latest flare-up is to get as many palestinians killed as possible . 
  that is the * only * possible reason for provoking israel with rockets , since they are fully aware their rocket fire is not actually threatening israel 's existence itself . 
  abbas said the same thing , as did the egyptian and saudi foreign ministers . 
  and it 's completely shameful , because unlike israel , hamas claims to be working for the very people it is getting killed . 
  none of this absolves israel of its guilt , but i have even less sympathy and tolerance for hamas and their ilk . 
  the specific event you linked to targeted a military headquarters ... 
  i did n't say they never killed civilians , i said they did n't target them . 
  as in , they did n't put bombs in exclusively civilian areas , shoot at school buses , launch rockets into cities , etc. 
  there * is * a difference even if it 's difficult for you to see . 
  and that difference goes a long way in explaining why they were able to so suddenly renounce violence and embrace their former enemies . 
  they were n't full of existential hatred toward whites . 
  a bit ironic considering israel is the only nation in the region that offers equal rights to minorities and gender equality to its women ... 
  but yeah , everything else that 's wrong with your stance has already been stated by others . 
  israel has a right to exist as much as a palestinian state does . 
  they probably do n't give a shit about russia or care about putin , but they back his plays because he 's the reason they 're wealthy in the first place . 
  that 's why they 're the ones to hit with sanctions , since that would directly affect putin 's main backers . 
  of course , it would also hurt london 's bankers . 
  is this a bad thing ? 
  taking a life to save ten should always be praised , should it not ? 
  random off-topic philosophical debates are probably not appropriate here though ... 
  the us was just throwing offers out and afaik they did n't say they would pay full price anyway . 
  well also , because germany got a sweet deal that nobody else would ever get and if they collectively bargained they would still lose out . 
  so of course , they did what was smartest for them and took the deal . 
  sure it hurts the rest of europe but ultimately german leaders are accountable to their own people . 
  well ... kinda . 
  it 's been about 50 years since they killed more people than any government in human history ? 
  before that they lasted about 100 years from killing the most people in history up to that point though . 
  but really , china has never actually had a long run of stability like a lot of other imperial powers .
