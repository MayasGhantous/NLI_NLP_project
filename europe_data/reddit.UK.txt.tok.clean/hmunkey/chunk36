  but whatever , more tourism !, 
  there are dozens of people who do the exact same thing with syriza . 
  vote on the merits of their post , not on some stupid character judgement . 
  good thing i was replying to a latvian then ... 
  if that 's what you mean by deregulation , what 's the problem ? 
  it 's not like safety standards are being lowered and uber drivers literally can not scam you by running up the meter , so consumer protection increases . 
  thanks mr raceandiq !, 
  you sound like a lovely fellow without any sort of hidden agenda . 
  the us does n't hide the budget , but they do n't specify what a large chunk of it is spent on . 
  the reason they do n't have to really hide the total figure is because everyone already assumes they have robust intelligence agencies . 
  even if they did cover the budget up nobody would seriously think that meant they no longer had capable spies . 
  plus they probably have some laws that make it impossible to allocate money without disclosing it . 
  the uk has similar things on the books but we also maintain a `` black budget '' where we do n't specify what exactly the money is for . 
  even if the world did that ( which would be insane ) , greece would still be horribly inefficient , corrupt , and have a bloated public sector . 
  that 's not how tax brackets usually work though . 
  normally , once you move up a bracket , only the money above the next income bracket is taxed at the new rate . 
  so if you make $ 105k , the first 50k is taxed at the sub-50k bracket , the next 50k is taxed at the 50k bracket , and the last 5k is taxed at the 100k bracket . 
  so there is always an incentive to earn more money because no matter what you will be better off . 
  the only exception is when some poor people are better off on benefits in some circumstances than they would be working . 
  after greece defaults romania will probably move ahead . 
  greece got more money than italy though despite the imbalance ... greece was also seen as too important to fail until recently . 
  now the rest of the ez is trying to cut their losses and salvage what little they can . 
  why would they invest in a place that would suffer knock-on effects from greece ? 
  investors are going to go to a different part of the world , at least for the time being . 
  most of asia and africa look decent right now . 
  or just wait for the extreme austerity that inevitably follows a default . 
  once the greek government can no longer borrow , the necessary cuts will be far greater than anything the troika ever asked for . 
  and they wo n't even have a choice because you ca n't spend money you do n't have , and there 's a 0 % chance of greece being able to import using the drachma . 
  he just wanted to keep the cool lighter for himself and made up an excuse .

  who suggested deregulating them ? 
  how about just not shielding them from competition ? 
  as it stands , taxi companies exist in an insulated bubble where no matter what happens , other people can not legally compete with them . 
  as a result they provide a shitty service at shitty prices . 
  if other companies could compete with them without having to buy licenses that cost several hundred thousand euros from existing cab drivers , we the consumers would win . 
  taxis are the only non-utility industry i can think of that has these sorts of absurd protectionist laws in place . 
  imagine if the government passed laws saying nobody can open a new supermarket without first buying a supermarket license from an existing one . 
  that would be horrible -- the existing supermarkets would have no incentive to lower prices or provide a better shopping experience because if someone else came around and opened a superior store with cheaper but higher-quality products , the shitty one could call the police and get them arrested . 
  or if that failed , they could go riot ... 
  those are entirely different languages though , not different dialects of the same language . 
  they do n't even have the same linguistic origins . 
  why is everyone here calling different languages `` dialects '' ? 
  dialects are variants of the * same * language , not different languages that descended from different languages . 
  this is why i was so confused by people saying they could n't understand `` dialects '' . 
  of course they could n't ; those were completely different languages . 
  it would be like me saying i could n't understand welsh or norwegian . 
  yeah , so like i said , that includes all taxes , not just federal . 
  federal income tax alone does n't go that high . 
  lol , if the data proves you wrong , call it bullshit and move on . 
  awesome logic you have going on there ... no matter what , you win !, 
  after all , reality is meaningless . 
  you heard it here first : / u/space9000 is more of an economic expert than the world bank , the imf , the un , and the cia . 
  i ca n't wait until you win the nobel prize . 
  [ here is the classification from wiki at least . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_italy#classification ) most of the `` dialects '' above are n't dialects at all ; they 're separate languages . 
  then why are people even calling them dialects here ? 
  [ if they 're different languages , they are n't dialects ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dialect ) . 
  no wonder i was so confused by how people speaking different dialects of the same language could n't understand each other . 
  [ it turns out they were speaking different languages with different linguistic origins . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/1pz01w/how_mutually_intelligible_are_dialects_in_italy/ ), 
  why are those still considered dialects and not separate languages then ? 
  scots is considered a separate language from english despite it being technically a lot closer to english than most of the `` dialects '' on the map are to each other . 
  ah ok that makes a lot more sense . 
  what they call dialect we call languages , so if that map were translated for the uk then scots would be a `` dialect '' of english . 
  [ based on this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_italy#classification ) , it appears that many of the `` dialects '' in the map above are really separate languages that derive from different language families . 
  no wonder i was confused by how people speaking different dialects of the same language could n't understand each other -- it turns out they were n't even speaking the same language . 
  these are the listed language groups : * gallo-rhaetian and ibero-romance * gallo-italic * italo-dalmatian * sardinian * albanian * slavic * greek * high german apparently within those groups people can understand each other reasonably well , but between those groups [ they are speaking different languages with different linguistic origins .

  the `` lazy greeks '' thing has nothing to do with the troika though -- that 's just what trashy rags and idiots say , not what the people who matter believe . 
  if you 're so upset by what idiots say and you want an independent monetary ( i think you meant monetary , not fiscal ) policy that badly , go for it . 
  just go in with your eyes wide open knowing what the consequences will be . 
  and remember , implementing your own monetary does n't mean your new currency will be stable nor does it mean anyone outside greece will accept it ( because let 's be honest , there 's no way they ever would ) . 
  that means greek imports are going to become a lot more expensive , although it also means greek exports will be cheaper . 
  the only problem : greece does n't really export very much , but it imports ~ 50 % of its good and ~ 80 % of its energy . 
  so the greek gdp will fall substantially , an extreme form of austerity will have to be implemented , pensions will have to be slashed , savings will lose most of their value , almost everything will become more expensive , greece will be cut off from international money markets and unable to borrow , ** but ** greece will have control of its monetary policy . 
  the actual upside is that potentially in a few years , greece will have some modest growth again . 
  of course , [ greece also had modest growth in 2014 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp-growth ) so it seems like a lot to sacrifice for something you already had , but it could be long lasting if the greek government manages to balance its budgets and institute reforms that increase greece 's competitiveness post-default .

  greece today is per capita richer than greece 20 years ago . 
  germany today is per capita richer than germany 20 years ago . 
  every country in europe today is per capita richer than they were 20 years ago . 
  [ almost every country in the world , and certainly every capitalist country is per capita richer than they were 20 years ago .

  you can replace the 20 with 40 , or 60 , or 80 , or 100 , etc. 
  and everything i just said holds true . 
  the only zero-sum thing in the world are its resources . 
  how we use them and what we 're able to do with them is what makes us all wealthier despite having limited resources . 
  we used to have problems growing enough food , until the green revolution hit , during which the agricultural techniques used by the developed countries of the west were spread to developing countries in asia and africa . 
  the resources of all those countries did n't change but their crop yields did , and since then the only famines that have taken place were caused by bad government policy , not a lack of food production . 
  pick any industry and the same thing will almost always hold true . 
  this is even true with non-renewable resources . 
  [ here is a map showing gdp growth rates around the world in 2010 . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/gdp_real_growth_rate_2007_cia_factbook.png ) notice anything interesting ? 
  almost the entire world 's gdp is growing , albeit slowly because of the global recession . 
  how is that possible if our resources are n't increasing ? 
  i mean , the few places that are n't growing are not really large enough or resource-rich enough to be fuelling global growth , which means that almost everybody is getting richer and it 's not at the expense of others .
