  it 's like norway increasing taxes on the oil industry or germany increasing taxes on the auto manufacturing industry . 
  what else are they supposed to do ? 
  tax individuals even more ? 
  or go after small industries that wo n't really have much money to begin with ? 
  greece has better it infrastructure than sweden or norway ? 
  i find that extremely difficult to believe . 
  do you have a source ? 
  no , this was the proposal given to the greek government when they walked out . 
  why do you think it 's a lie ? 
  even the greek government has n't said that . 
  no , and the laffer curve is n't even relevant in this situation anyway . 
  the laffer curve assumes `` perfect '' law enforcement and has nothing to do with tax evasion though . 
  it 's not applicable at all here . 
  instead it represents how high taxes stifle economic activity at a certain point , which in the end leads to lower tax revenues . 
  it does not suggest that high taxes cause more tax evasion . 
  greek law enforcement is notoriously lax when it comes to taxation and if they had a german or american tax collection system their revenues would be much higher . 
  i agree with most of what you said , or at least the conclusions , but i had a few quibbles : 1 . 
  yes , most benefits go to white people ( many of whom vote republican ) , but this should obviously be the case if only because there are 6-7x as many white people as black people . 
  however , in places like mississippi ( or any southern state ) where those ratios are not true , black people are by far the biggest welfare recipients . 
  it 's just that nationwide in net contributor states , that 's not the case . 
  yes , bases boost local economies but they 're still not really traditional forms of fiscal transfers . 
  most of the soldiers on those bases are n't natives and the corporate welfare aspect of it is in maryland , virginia , and california , where the defence contractors and administration is . 
  [ the overwhelming majority of the spending is actually welfare ] ( http://www.dfa.state.ms.us/offices/obfm/forms/fy2015_bulletin.pdf ) , not highways or bases or anything of that nature . 
  ( pdf warning ! ), 
  the south subjugated a large part of its population for such a long time that those people are now stuck in poverty . 
  through electoral tricks , those same people are also underrepresented politically ( to be fair the democrats do the same thing in the north ) . 
  as a result , states that appear to be very right-wing are the biggest overall welfare recipients , but it 's not necessarily the case that the right-wing voters are receiving that assistance and in fact the opposite is more true . 
  keep in mind it 's not necessarily the same people receiving those government benefits who vote republican in southern states . 
  southern states have by far the [ highest proportion of black people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_african-american_population ) , and [ they are far more likely to receive benefits ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/12/the-politics-and-demographics-of-food-stamp-recipients/ ) . 
  of course there 's still a great deal of hypocrisy , but the simple conclusion that the south is full of republicans on welfare is n't exactly accurate and even in the `` reddest '' of states ~ 40 % of the population vote democrat . 
  turns out most people are n't stupid and they generally vote for their best interests . 
  now that said , the fact that southern white people have historically been racist to say the least explains why so many black people are stuck in poverty and are dependent on benefits . 
  and obviously , the reason so many black people live in the south in the first place is a legacy of slavery . 
  ny is by far the most extreme example though , in large part because it 's home to nyc and wall street/nyse/other massive federal cash cows . 
  if you look at other states and it 's not that different from the eu , and if you look at recipients the figures are all within an order of magnitude of eu transfers . 
  you 're also forgetting that a large part of the figures in the us chart are military-related expenditures , since [ many ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fort_benning ) of the [ largest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fort_campbell ) bases [ are ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fort_bragg ) in lesser-populated [ areas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marine_corps_base_camp_lejeune ) in the south . 
  those are obviously not factored into eu expenses . 
  this is n't to suggest that us fiscal transfers are n't substantially greater than eu ones or that the eu should n't federalise more to deal with imbalance within member states , but there seems to be this mythologising about how simply implementing fiscal transfers would solve our problems when really they 're already implemented to an extent and even if we expanded them we 'd still have huge problems . 
  greece 's long-term problem was not that they did n't have the money to sustain themselves ; it was that they did n't have the money to sustain themselves with northern european-style social programmes ( compounded with endemic corruption and tax evasion ) . 
  doubling or even tripling the amount of money they received would not have solved the problem -- [ just look at the size of the budget deficit before the crisis ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/government-budget ) . 
  most countries ? 
  like which ones ? 
  even most autocratic regimes detain people rather than just shoot them . 
  because the us is the biggest/wealthiest media market . 
  if they 're competing , that means they 're watching . 
  and if they 're watching , that means every media company and advertiser wants to get a piece of the action . 
  the 1994 fifa world cup in the usa still holds the record for the most profitable ( by a huge margin ) and best-attended tournament in wc history , despite americans not really liking football very much . 
  it sucks but that 's how it is . 
  soon enough china will be in the same position though , and eventually india as well . 
  states in the us also give up a huge amount of sovereignty in return and the federal government is allowed to freely operate within the states . 
  if you look at all the rhetoric from various parties in europe , whether the fn or ukip or syriza ( or honestly even the tories and most centre-right parties ) , the idea of giving up more sovereignty to the eu is anathema . 
  would syriza ( or any of those other parties ) be willing to allow german and french agents working for the eu to come to athens and arrest greek citizens for tax evasion ? 
  would they be ok with eu agents arresting their own politicians for corruption ? 
  because that 's how it works in the us -- the fbi and irs are extremely powerful and can cross state borders with impunity , and they [ have a track record ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_american_state_and_local_politicians_convicted_of_crimes ) of arresting powerful people [ including the chief executives ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rod_blagojevich_corruption_charges ) of [ state governments ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bob_mcdonnell#federal_corruption_charges.2c_conviction_and_sentencing ) ( aka their pms ) . 
  can you imagine european leaders voluntarily agreeing to put themselves in a position where foreign police officers can come to their office and drag them to out in handcuffs to a court in another country ? 
  there are two sides of the coin and although parties may like the idea of fiscal transfers ( assuming they 're the recipients of course ) , they would almost certainly oppose letting big countries like germany have a hand in their domestic law enforcement . 
  and you need both to actually succeed , because otherwise you just have a situation where richer countries throw their money away in poorer ones where people do n't pay taxes and politicians loot everything they can . 
  [ also , there are already fiscal transfers in place in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#net_contributors_and_recipients ) and [ they 're actually somewhat comparable in value to the transfers within the us in many cases . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/08/americas-fiscal-union ) just make sure you keep in mind the us data i linked is over 20 years rather than one year . 
  there is also one other major problem : many if not most people in richer countries would rather see greece leave the euro rather than send billions of euros there on a regular basis forever . 
  the us on the other hand is very strongly against the idea of states leaving the union ( [ to say the least ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_civil_war ) ) so permanent fiscal transfers are lot more acceptable . 
  it also helps that the us has two major political parties , so when a state run by the republican party needs money they can rely on their fellow republicans in washington dc to send it . 
  radical leftists in greece ca n't really do that since they do n't have close ideological allies in positions of power across the eu , and certainly not in control of the european parliament . 
  that 's why they do n't get as much attention though -- the leaders in the medal tables for summer olympics are the usa and china , neither of which competed . 
  and then there are all the track athletes from places in the caribbean and africa who break world records , none of whom competed . 
  same for swimmers from australia and east asia . 
  europeans do n't really win the medals people want to watch very much , like track and swimming . 
  instead european olympic teams do well in stuff like rowing , equestrian sports , cycling , fencing , etc. 
  it 's the same as how nobody really cares about the afc asian cup compared to the copa am\u00e9rica or the uefa euro cup . 
  if turkey was still trying to join the eu and they felt like they had a chance , they would be making massive reforms and protecting homosexuals . 
  look at all the eastern bloc states that joined the eu -- they basically transformed their societies in almost every aspect to become members . 
  the fact that nobody in turkey still thinks eu membership is even on the table is one of the main reasons for the increase in regressive nonsense . 
  turkey right now is no less bad for lgbt people than ukraine was 5 years ago or poland was 20 years ago . 
  this is stupid . 
  / u/cuen outlined why it makes no sense to just accept the claim that the turkish military allowed 50 + isis fighters along with truck bombs to cross border checkpoints to kobane , but the rest of the article is nonsense too . 
  one thing people never seem to understand is that to turkey , the ypg is just as great if not a greater threat than isis . 
  why ? 
  because the ypg and its parent organisation ( pyd ) are thoroughly linked with the pkk , and hundreds if not thousands of ypg fighters are pkk members who crossed into syria from turkey . 
  unlike isis , the pkk has killed tens of thousands of turks over the years . 
  and unlike isis , the pkk has openly made territorial claims on huge swathes of turkey . 
  of course the turkish government , regardless of who is in charge , will not be eager to see isis lose if that means the ypg takes control of the border with kurdish parts of turkey . 
  erdogan is n't backing isis though and there is no credible evidence this is or has ever been the case ; he is however backing various fsa groups and some islamists who the us shies away from ( although other us allies also back those same groups ) . 
  every single one of these factions is anti-isis and anti-assad though . 
  if isis somehow `` wins '' in syria ( which will not happen but for the sake of argument ) , nothing suggests turkey wo n't intervene and put an end to their little caliphate . 
  but turkey is not going to do that so long as assad is still powerful and in control of the most important parts of syria , as that would be tantamount to invading to help the pkk and the assad regime . 
  i still do n't understand how it applies though . 
  even more so if you import almost everything . 
  greece imports the majority of its food and almost all its energy ... switching to the drachma is going to hurt . 
  i do n't understand the analogy ... is greece the restaurant ? 
  if so , that would mean a restaurant is asking suppliers to continue supplying it despite the fact that they are unprofitable and can not afford to pay the suppliers back . 
  of course the suppliers would refuse . 
  it has nothing to do with price gouging . 
  every other ez member is a democracy too . 
  if their governments did what their electorates wanted , greece would 've been out of the euro years ago . 
  the people of northern europe want ~ ~ a grexit ~ ~ to stop giving money to greece . 
  democracy does n't just apply to greece . 
  edit : i have no idea if people actually want a grexit , even if the consequences of what they do want would inevitably lead to one . 
  i know in some countries like the netherlands they do however . 
  edited for clarity . 
  regardless , my point was simply that the democracy excuse is a silly one since every country involved in these negotiations is a democracy , most of which are ( unlike greece ) not run by minority governments either .
