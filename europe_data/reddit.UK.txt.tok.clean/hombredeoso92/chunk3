  but i 'm a bit of a photography/geography nut so i really enjoyed making it . 
  it 's really fun . 
  i 've done it with a few things now . 
  i did consider it . 
  but then decided against it because then it could be argued that spain could be divided up into autonomous regions too . 
  maybe next time i 'll divide it up . 
  the map is a bit skewed at the corners, 
  i 'm a bit of a geography nut myself so i 'm happy too , 
  i 'm considering doing an r/cityporn one too . 
  hopefully that will be able to showcase each country in a more distinctive manner . 
  thanks mate !, 
  yeah , me too, 
  i 'm considering it but that 'll take a long time to complete, 
  my savings account ( and overdraft unfortunately ) have become a travel account since i graduated from uni . 
  do it !, 
  i do plan to visit ; your country looks beautiful !, 
  and i 'll keep that tip in mind . 
  the resolution is 1984 \u00d7 1736 . 
  feel free to crop it as required, 
   the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , commonly known as the united kingdom ( uk ) or britain , is a sovereign country in western europe it is . 
  it 's a country of countries . 
  i 'll make a point in getting myself there on my next adventure  do me a favour and get yourself there too !, 
  also , visit finland and norway if you have n't already since you 're pretty close , right ? 
  the one for northern ireland is part of the uk one . 
  ireland is a different country .

  hopefully you get a chance to visit soon and satisfy your porn needs  * just bring an umbrella, 
  feeling the same up here in glasgow, 
  netherlands ? 
  thanks mate , 
   the islands are an autonomous country within the kingdom of denmark https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/faroe_islands  scotland is a country that is part of the united kingdom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scotland, 
  thanks . 
  glad you think so , 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn/search?q=switzerland&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=all https://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn/search?q=iceland&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=all i see the iceland one does n't have the most upvotes but it 's still at the top even when sorted by `` top '' of all time . 
  my mistake with that one . 
  the switzerland one appears to have the highest number of upvotes though . 
  that 's weird because i just rechecked and it 's showing as the ones i used : /, 
  it 's on majorca . 
  the waters around the balearics really are amazing . 
  yeah , i could do . 
  may have to wait until next weekend though . 
  meh , i do n't think iran , iraq , saudi arabia , jordan etc do either but they were on the blank map that i got so why the hell not ? 
  looks better than it all greyed out . 
  it 's one of my favourite ones, 
  i already explained this to someone else . 
  i thought about it ( i 'm scottish after all ) . 
  but if i split up the uk , where does it stop ? 
  i could split up spain into its autonomous regions because they 're all very different from each other . 
  mate , i get that feeling too . 
  but because it 's just across the irish sea from me , i always think that i can go there any time and decide to go farther afield . 
  still have n't been . 
   thanks . 
  it 's actually really simple in photoshop . 
   - use magic wand tool to select the area of the country  - open the image you want to place into that country in a separate file . 
   - copy the whole image  - return to map and select paste special  paste into then just play around with it until it fits . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6p1hoi/i_took_the_top_posts_in_rearthporn_from_all/dklxxeh i started out with a blank map of europe with the borders pre-drawn . 
  yeah , there are a couple on here that i do n't think do the countries justice . 
  but my aim was to use the top posts from r/earthporn so i stuck to that . 
  that one of iceland you posted is amazing !, 
  i could n't leave out ickle kosovo , 
  i know . 
  poor andorra , liechtenstein and malta :(, 
  maybe she does , but she 's just wants it all to herself, 
  i agree and i had considered using other but my aim was to use the top posts from r/earthporn so i stuck to that . 
  fair enough . 
  i am a little disappointed with some of the images , but the idea was to use the top posts in r/earthporn and these were those images . 
  yeah , the only solution i have to that is the links to the originals in my initial comment . 
  i know . 
  i had considered splitting it up but then where would it stop ? 
  i could also split spain up into different autonomous regions because they 're all quite different too . 
  bonus pic for our australian friends http://i.imgur.com/rnljstn.jpg, 
  updated the broken links and tidied up the comment to make it a bit more readable , 
  i know :( sad times, 
  i quite enjoyed how france and turkey appear to be miles colder than finland . 
  me too . 
  i am slowly working my way through them all . 
  brexit better not fuck up my momentum . 
  well said . 
  we should all be proud of our continent !, 
  thanks . 
  it 's actually really simple in photoshop . 
  - use magic wand tool to select the area of the country - open the image you want to place into that country in a separate file . 
  - copy the whole image - return to map and select paste special  paste into then just play around with it until it fits . 
  can r/mapporn get included too ? 
  edit : love the edit ; everyone loves more porn !, 
  thanks !, 
  glad you like it , 
  links to all images are included below . 
  i know some of these images are n't * technically * europe , but i thought it would look nicer to include them than just grey them out . 
  also , i 'm aware that greenland and faroe islands are part of denmark , and that svalbard is part of norway but i gave them separate images otherwise the images would have to be too stretched out to fit and it probably would n't look great . 
  edit : changed some broken links and tidied up the comment a bit to make it more readable edit2 : please stop telling me that the uk should have been split up . 
  my reasoning for deciding to keep it as one is because the official , internationally recognised name of the country is the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland . 
  if i divided up the uk , i could , arguably , divide up spain into autonomous regions who are also all very different from each other linguistically , culturally and geographically . 
  there was no political motivation behind this move so stop calling me a unionist .

  even if most of us are incapable of being this inhuman , it 's important we learn from the lessons of history to make sure we see the signs early on and ( hopefully ) prevent shit like this from occurring again . 
  i think he 's talking about something completely benign . 
  something along the lines of `` i was trying to reach the lightbulb in my bedroom to change it but my ceilings are just too damn high '' and merkel is just thinking `` here we go again with the lightbulb story '', 
  do n't forget british tourists . 
  that whole coast is just britain 2.0,
