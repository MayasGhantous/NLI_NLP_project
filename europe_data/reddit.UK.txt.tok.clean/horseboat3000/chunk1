the prime minister does not have to be a mp and the current one is . 
  elected to parliament by the people of her constituency . 
   in germany , kiesinger was no mp while he was chancellor and ? 
   that is not undemocratic and does not mean they are unelected . 
  just not elected by the people at any point . 
  you 'll note however that i never called that undemocratic . 
  i pointed out that the electoral college is also not undemocratic , and that may was elected . 
  these are factual statements , you 'll note , and as such get downvoted on this sub because the only thing you lot hate more than an englishman is a yank . 
  and if your point was just `` both of them are representative democracy '' then do explain why you would go on to draw the distinction that `` but these people stay to represent their countries in other matters too '' ( conveniently ignoring that the parliament has no ability to actually legislate ) , and that * that * is how representative democracy works ? 
  because that 's not how someone saying that both systems are equivalently democratic behaves . 
  it 's how a little man who was saying his way is better , gets caught out , then claims it 's not a pissing contest , and gets caught out again does . 
  you said the eu , * unlike * the us , is `` how representative democracy works '' . 
  you then claimed did n't and that it was n't a pissing contest . 
  so you 're either a hypocrite or an moron . 
   did i say so ? 
    that 's how representative democracy works . 
  yeah . 
  yeah , you quite plainly did . 
   this is n't some democracy dick measuring contest . 
  i agree . 
  you should put your measuring tape away . 
   risk = / = threat even if i were to grant that , reuters reported juncker said that `` trump ... ** poses risk ** to relations '' . 
  juncker said , verbatim , `` the election of trump ** poses the risk ** of upsetting intercontinental relations '' [ emphasis mine ] . 
  apparently on your demented planet , `` poses risk '' = / = `` poses risk '' . 
  no one except you has used the word `` threat '' . 
  but i guess being a smug pedantic asshole did n't help * you * understand that . 
   reuters claims juncker said something , while in reality they are interpreting what he said . 
  reuters claims juncker said something , then provide a direct word-for-word quote where he says exactly that . 
   go on with your insults if that 's what makes you happy . 
  i 'm very happy to insult people who continually show themselves deserving of it . 
  oh , and i notice you 've silently backed off your insistence that fucking ** reuters ** of all people are a tabloid . 
  i 've actually never heard anyone say anything more idiotic in my entire life . 
  may was elected * to * parliament by the people . 
  exactly not like juncker . 
   that 's how representative democracy works . 
  there are many ways representative democracy works , genius . 
  some are federal , some are unitary , some are presidential , some are parliamentary . 
  just because you like your system does n't mean other systems are magically undemocratic . 
  that 's just fine , you can prefer whatever you like . 
  but you do n't get to say demonstrably untrue things about other systems , like the shitcunt above me has been busy doing . 
   so where is the threat of relations ? 
    `` the election of trump ** poses the risk of upsetting intercontinental relations ** in their foundation and in their structure , '' said juncker , who as head of the eu 's executive is one of europe 's most powerful political figures . 
  [ emphasis mine ] this is a direct quote . 
  it quite plainly says what you claim was never said . 
  now who has n't read beyond the title ? 
   because it seems to me that you 're cherry picking i really do n't care what things seem like to you , because you have a bad habit of being constantly wrong . 
   also i notice that you refuse to comment on your claim of juncker not being elected . 
  he is in no way elected by `` your vote '' as you claimed . 
  saying america does n't respect your vote because there 's an electoral college of representatives who elect the executive on your behalf but europe does respect your vote because there 's a legislature ( who have no actual * legislative * powers , mind ) who elect an executive is absolutely hypocritical . 
  but i note you 're not commenting on that either ...

   have you actually read the articl yes . 
  so you 're wrong again thought so . 
   totally not a tabloid . 
  it 's reuters . 
  are you unaware of what reuters is ? 
  here 's a hint : it 's as far from a tabloid as it 's possible to get . 
  just because they occasionally report things that are inconvenient to europhiles like you does n't mean they 're a tabloid . 
  honestly fucking look up who reuters are . 
   tours the world he is unaware of   trump ignorant of europe these are equivalent statements . 
  or in addition to having no clue who reuters are , do you also not know what the word ignorant means ? 
   you read too much ye olde nigel propaganda . 
  and you read too little of anything , from the looks of it . 
   the european executive is elected by the european parliament . 
  right . 
  so not elected by `` your vote '' . 
  elected by a group of elected representatives . 
  almost like , you know , an * electoral college * . 
  but do tell me again how `` here your vote matters '' . 
  being a smug cunt really makes people love the eu . 
  worked wonders for you in britain . 
   i 'll remind you that theresa may has not gone through elections yes she has . 
  that 's how she was , you know , elected . 
   and that donald john trump has been elected with less votes than the opposition . 
  fewer votes . 
  and he was elected exactly according to the established and agreed-upon rules . 
  ah yes , reuters , that famous * tabloid * . 
  you actually ca n't be fucking serious . 
  yep , your vote really matters when the european executive is unelected and the elected legislature has no ability to initiate legislation . 
  really matters so very much . 
  and the electoral college is there to provide representation to less populous states and regions . 
  i thought the `` sophisticated '' european view was that this * should * be the case ? 
  or is it `` representation for me but not for thee '' ? 
  no , your government is doing so because it is banned gm imports despite the wto ruling against the legality of doing so . 
  for the third time now , you 're free to eat or not eat whatever you like . 
  the eu however is * not * free to engage in illegal trade tactics such as banning gm imports . 
   its up to you what you put in your mounth . 
  not if you 're in germany . 
  then it 's up to the government what you can and ca n't put in your mouth . 
   and please dont try dictate what i have to eat . 
  i 'm not .
