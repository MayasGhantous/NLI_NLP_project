  hardly the behaviour of people deeply , fundamentally opposed to it . 
   now what i find amazing is how people like you bleat about sovereignty and lack of democracy regarding the eu ( no matter the fact of the matter ) denying the organisational nature of the eu , i see . 
  typical . 
   but then are perfectly happy to deny the scots any say in what happens continuing , despite repeated evidence to the contrary , that the scots have been denied their say when they 've had more say than anyone else , i see . 
  typical . 
   and would rather they would just shut up and bow down to the will of westminster without complaint or question you mean acknowledge how democracy works ? 
  yes , yes i think they should . 
  scotland does not have a veto on the uk , nor should it . 
  it is a `` country '' only in the sense that that is the name for top-level regions of the uk ; some call them provinces , some territories , some states , some regions , and some oblasts -- we call them countries . 
   if you want to accuse someone of hypocrisy , do n't do it yourself . 
  good job i have n't , then . 
   and yes , i did insult you there , not as part of my argument per se ( the statement holds if you use less insulting terms ) mind , unlike your case . 
  you mean like mine , which was a rather less than serious aside at the very end of the post ? 
  yes , clearly a central part of the argument . 
  but you obviously knew that . 
  oh , i know you did n't . 
  you just never held it to the same critical standard you apply to the tories . 
   and holocaust denial is linked to nazi ideology it 's also linked to islamic society . 
  it 's also linked to conspiracy cranks who think the moon landings were faked and who do no harm beyond being the most annoying people on earth . 
  being `` linked '' to something means nothing . 
   tories win 50.7 % of seats with 36.9 % of the vote `` unacceptable !, 
  unrepresentative !, 
  undemocratic ! '', 
   snp win nearly twice the percentage of seats as of votes , and 95 % of scottish seats with 50 % of scottish votes * crickets *, 
   if you think that scotland should be simply disregarded how was it disregarded ? 
  scots had the exact same say as everyone else in the referendum . 
   then considering that what the rest of the uk wants and what scotland wants are so different on one issue , an issue of foreign policy on which the scottish government has no say . 
  what london wants is even more different from what most of england wants , yet no one seriously suggests this as legitimate grounds for independence . 
   and that there are those like you that would deny them representation and a say in the course of their nation they are * over-represented * in parliament on a per capita basis , and have a significant amount of devolved authority , far more than is typical in unitary states . 
  this is not `` deny [ ing ] them representation '' , this is simply not letting a region of 5 million dictate terms to 60 million others . 
   they would be far better off out of the uk . 
  if you ignore shred of actual evidence on the matter and care only about `` sovereignty '' , then you * might * have some argument . 
  but then a proud european citizen and remainer like you would sneer at such a mindset , would n't you ? 
   and with that your comment is already considered a `` 0 '' in this study no it 's not , as anyone who took even a cursory glance at the methodology would know . 
   because `` some types of speech can be regulated by the government '' why is that in quotes ? 
  it 's not a quotation from any related document i can see nor find on google , nor is it cited . 
  no nation anywhere thinks that there is no speech that ought to be illegal , as perjury laws exist . 
   specifically , in your comment , those that incite violence . 
  you know that was n't one of the eight yes/no statements asked by pew , right ? 
  oh wait , you do n't . 
   that 's exactly why germany is below the us -- because germans say exactly what your comment said . 
  no , germany is below the us because germans think speech is unacceptable if it is `` offensive to minority groups '' , `` offensive to your religion and beliefs '' , `` is sexually explicit '' , `` calls for violent protests '' , or is related to national security , while the us [ supports all but the last two ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/11/18/appendix-c-detailed-tables/#free-speech ) . 
  so yeah , maybe try knowing what you 're talking about next time you try to claim germans hold the same position of speech as i do . 
  ah yes , obviously the uk 's attitude is to blame . 
  it 's clearly the uk not europe who 's been making threats of punitive action . 
  it 's clearly the uk not europe who is constantly being found in the wrong by the wto for illegal discrimination against non-european products and firms . 
  it 's clearly the uk not the eu who shoots down trade deals with the us , canada , china , japan , and just about every major non-european nation on earth . 
  it 's clearly the uk not the eu whose common agricultural policy is intended to create unfavourable conditions for external growers and has done untold damage to africa . 
  yep , definitely britain with the combative and insular attitude . 
  never the eu . 
   in the least representative election in uk history . 
  and how is that ? 
  turnout was the higher than any previous uk referendum and higher than any general election in 25 years . 
  well , given that they 're a subdivision of a unitary state , over-represented in parliament , with no authority over foreign affairs and a vested interest in things going poorly , no , she really should n't have any fucking say . 
  neither should the mayor of tewkesbury . 
   there are no valid arguments for freedom of expression , and neither are there any valid arguments for democracy , in the first place . 
  arguments like `` we ought to have freedom of expression . '', 
  or `` we ought to adopt democracy . '', 
  are never valid , as they are based on opinions oh the irony . 
  that these arguments are `` never valid '' is * no more than ** your ** opinion * , and thus not necessarily valid itself . 
  or are your opinions special ? 
   only if you could prove that we should strive towards freedom of expression ( you ca n't ) i guess all the moral and social philosophers did n't exist . 
  i guess i also must have dreamt the udhr . 
  that you 're incapable or unwilling to understand the arguments for it says more about you than it does about free expression . 
  i imagine you 'd sing a different tune if someone said `` there are no valid arguments for women 's rights , abortion , equal pay , abolition of slavery , or opposition to racism , as they are * just based on opinions * '' . 
  i imagine if you were suddenly sentenced to death , you 'd claim you have a fundamental right to life , and might be a bit miffed if you were told `` nonsense , that 's invalid because it 's just your opinion '' . 
  and since you seem to have no problem stereotyping americans , i 'll gladly indulge myself in saying that it comes as no surprise the swede seems to know about as little about human rights as he does about the states . 
  well , yes . 
  if freedom of speech is only the freedom to say things everyone broadly likes , it is a redundant , valueless concept . 
  the entire point of it is that one ought to be free to say things that do not incite violence . 
  problem for you is that [ yes it is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_states_of_the_world_trade_organization#members_and_observers ) . 
  it 's simply dually represented by the eu as well . 
   you are already seeing the eu countries as the others well in the context of uk-eu negotiations , yes , the eu quite plainly * are * `` the others '' . 
   and they are wrong and evil but you in the right . 
  said nothing of the sort , projecting perhaps ? 
  but when it comes to punitive measures , the uk is not the one suggesting that europe be `` punished '' and constantly making threats . 
  but of course that 's all everyone else 's fault because the eu can do no wrong . 
  spare me . 
   ireland can get away with that because it 's member of the eu . 
  without being a member of the eu , like the uk will be , it is open to retaliation then do explain how ireland managed to `` get away with it '' just fine before joining the eu . 
   it does n't protect non members though , which makes brexit a dangerous prospect in terms of tit for tat destructive behavior , like the old days . 
  good thing the wto exists then , and not only exists but * routinely * rules against the eu for violating international terms of trade . 
   this threat of a major economy lowering corporation tax to 10 % merely invites a counter threat from the eu to cut off access for the uk , and so it goes on ireland 's had a very low corporate tax rate for decades , undercutting the rest of europe . 
  it 's not suffered the ill effects you claim to be inevitable . 
  and it did so before being an eu member state . 
   we were all doing it for hundreds of years until europe came together that european peace coincides with the eu establishes nothing beyond there being a correlation . 
   it 's the way that we 've all taken sides against our former partners . 
  it 's the way we talk to each other now as rivals as participants in a zero sum game . 
  then stop doing it . 
  britain does n't hate the eu , it just does n't want to be part of it any longer . 
  much of europe however is actively vindictive towards the uk for wanting to leave . 
  the eu being spiteful can hardly be blamed on `` the not-eu '' . 
   more to do with distance and dissimilarities in power than any miracle . 
  or more to do with the eu not being this magical * necessary * instrument for there to be any hope of peace and trade . 
  [ clydebank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clydebank_blitz ) is scottish though , last i checked . 
   you see ? 
  the minute someone leaves the eu and we are back at each others throats . 
  if anyone doubted the need for the eu brexit should prove it prove what ? 
  eu membership has n't stopped ireland from utilising a low corporate tax rate to undercut the rest of europe and encourage business . 
  but if those * nasty * brits with their * nasty * brexit even consider doing the same , it 's somehow proof of the eu 's necessity ?
