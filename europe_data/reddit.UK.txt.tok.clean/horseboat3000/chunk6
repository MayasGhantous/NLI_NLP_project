  hardly overwhelmingly skilled movement . 
   so what 's the problem ? 
  that the eu requires us to take people who would * not * otherwise qualify in addition to those who would . 
  this really is n't difficult stuff , pal . 
   look at you cherrypicking your countries instead of afghanistan , iraq , yemen , eritrea , ethiopia or pakistan and look at you cherrypicking abject shitholes rather than chile or india . 
  just like you pretended , contrary to objective and demonstrable fact , that eu immigration is primarily from countries like germany rather than poland . 
  you dishonest little fuck . 
   that 's not an answer , that 's a meme . 
  no it 's not . 
  in many cases each of those are problems , or perceived as such . 
  christ you 're fucking thick  correct , i was speaking historically . 
  historically , india and ireland have had higher migration than pakistan and china . 
  you 're entirely incorrect no matter which way you slice it . 
  it 's okay to admit to being wrong , mate . 
  you really just make yourself look a cunt when you insist your falsehoods are actually true . 
   also nobody is complaining about all those irish and germans ( the two largest eu migrant states by far ) , purely due to perception . 
  yes they are . 
  also , there are more than * twice * as many poles as germans in the uk , so you 're yet again full of shit . 
  when you 're wrong * in the same way * over and over again , it really starts to look like lying . 
   a ) stop trying to make this so childishly personal it 's not `` making it childishly personal '' , it 's calling you out for spreading falsehoods and then claiming the moral high ground . 
   b ) i 've not told any lies above no , not lies , because that would require me to establish intent . 
  i only said you said things that are untrue . 
   c ) are you seriously defending abject lies with whataboutisms ? 
  and for the record you ca n't establish them as lies either . 
  they 're just falsehoods , * exactly like everything you said above * . 
   so glad brexiteers default to this after 1 post every single time . 
  so very glad . 
  so glad remainers like you default to being smug little shits when they 're shown to be talking out their ass . 
   usurping someone else 's poorly worded waffle that you ca n't read does n't make something poorly worded . 
  it makes you stupid . 
  and yes , how very dare i respond to things in the post i 'm responding to . 
  as usual you contribute nothing but lies and smug partisan bullshit . 
  on the first fucking page of a google search for `` charlie hebdo racist '' , i have articles from not only salon , but from the guardian , the bbc , and the mail , all fanning the flames of a non-story about non-racism . 
  literally every single thing in that post except for `` the left generally are more open to political change '' is not just wrong but the complete opposite of the truth . 
  i ca n't remember ever seeing anyone so wrong so often in so little space . 
  green is also the colour most deeply associated with islam . 
   no , you have to start with far right wingers . 
  last time they were in charge they installed dictatorships , started a world war and killed millions of people from minority groups in death camps so ... the exact same thing that fundamentalist islam has done and * continues to do * , apart from sparking a world war ( yet ) ? 
   relative to the far right even isis is minor threat . 
  and just where on a political spectrum do you think isis fall ? 
  they 're not social democrats , mate . 
  so when you say `` far right wingers '' , what you really mean is `` white far right wingers '' , because god forbid anybody say anything mean about the poor , downtrodden muslims . 
  go to fuck with that pathetic , cringing , denialistic self-flagellation . 
   the majority of immigration to the uk comes from outside the eu technically correct , but by a [ 51-49 ] ( https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/statistics-net-migration-statistics/#create-graph ) margin . 
  for all intents and purposes , as many people come from the eu as come from the other 7 billion people on earth combined . 
  that 49 % of uk net migration is beyond the control of the uk government is surely understandably worrying to many , even if you do n't have an issue yourself . 
   and a majority from inside it is skilled ( which even in the case of brexit we would have negligible control over yeah , yet again not * nearly * as much as you think . 
  and if they 're so qualified that they 'd get in anyway , surely they can play by * the same rules as everyone else on planet earth * and go through the process that will see them granted a visa . 
  just like skilled japanese , chinese , australian , korean , or canadian people do . 
   who is the problem ? 
  syrian refugees ? 
  economic migrants ? 
  eu citizens ? 
  in many cases , the answer is the same : yes . 
   pakistanis or chinese ( our 2 biggest migrant nations ) ? 
  that 's [ not even remotely true ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign-born_population_of_the_united_kingdom ) . 
  india and poland both have more migration here than pakistan , and there are three eu states sending more people than china . 
   brexit simply promised a lie as opposed to all those truths you 've told above ? 
  we ought to get you a bus to decorate , the way you 've been dishonest above . 
   i have no idea what you 're trying to say here . 
  why am i not surprised ? 
  he 's saying remain was mismanaged as a campaign . 
   or here . 
  leave was infamous for not delivering a single shred of economic ( or any ) policy at all . 
  infamous amongst your lot , anyway . 
   in your opinion , which is worth nothing , considering the type of person you 've proven yourself to be . 
  the kind of person who voted against trump , and who , unlike you , does n't [ call for the murder of elected officials ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5lmtmh/impeaching_trump_the_process_begins_now/dbwu5hw/ ) . 
  i 'm proud to be that , which is more than your mother can say of how you turned out . 
   yes he fucking did , he himself talks about how he 'd grab women by their pussies without asking . 
  that 's sexual fucking assault . 
  no it 's not . 
  i truly hope for your wife 's sake that you do n't explicitly ask each time you initiate intimate contact . 
  in context ( a word you plainly do n't know the meaning of ) , sexual contact may easily be welcomed or even encouraged without an explicit verbal exchange . 
   they disappeared after donalds cult of personality swarmed her with death threats before she went public . 
  no , they disappeared because they were bullshit . 
  people testify against crime bosses all the time without being killed or intimidated into dropping charges . 
  law enforcement exists for exactly this purpose , and law enforcement found their `` cases '' lacking . 
   lmao , i heard he also killed jesus . 
  no , just [ killed american citizens without trial or due process ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abdulrahman_al-awlaki ) , engaged in unprecedented levels of mass surveillance , and led the worst administration ever for [ whistleblowers ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/16/whistleblowers-double-standard-obama-david-petraeus-chelsea-manning ) . 
   then prove it , oh wait , you ca n't , because it 's not that rare . 
  the burden of proof is not on me to prove the negative claim . 
  but in any case , there [ has n't been a politician killed this year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_assassinated_american_politicians ) , so it 's obviously not as widespread as you fucking think . 
  there * have * however been repeated shootings and murders of trump supporters , and over 750 homicides in chicago , one of the most democratic cities on earth , and very very few of those homicides are committed by white trump voters . 
   that 's what 's known as `` hyperbole . '', 
  that 's an exaggerated statement not meant to be taken literally . 
  mate , when every statement you make is utterly retarded and you double down on most of them as being true , claiming `` hyperbole '' does n't really work . 
  even if it did , there 's still more violence on the left than the right currently . 
   sure it is . 
  pay no attention to that abortion doctor firebombings behind the curtain . 
  you mean the zero killings that happen this year ? 
  or the one last year by a man who was [ found mentally unfit to stand trial ? ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/05/11/planned-parenthood-shooting-suspect-found-not-competent-stand-trial/84243964/ ) . 
  really compares to multiple homicides and attempted homicies of trump voters and pervasive violence against them . 
  violence that is stoked and encouraged by people like you and rhetoric like yours . 
  you are a sickening pustule of a man , and bear far more responsibility for violence than nigel farage ever could . 
   oh , you mean the ruling that trump and his piece of shit followers are going to attack because they 're misogynist filth ? 
  no , i mean the one trump has repeatedly said he accepts and will not attempt to repeal . 
   wrong . 
  right . 
   farage ? 
  his entire political career has been largely devoted to being a cunt .
