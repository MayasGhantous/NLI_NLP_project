trust us brits to be different , eh ? 
  when the founders they 're referring to are jean monnet , winston churchill , joseph bech , sicco mansholt , alcide de gasperi , konrad adenauer , and altiero spinelli - there are no ladies , no mothers there . 
  it 's all founding fathers . 
   it contains no ex-civil servants . 
  they are all elected politicians , for better or for worse . 
  there 's at least one exception to that , the uk 's lord hill is a life peer and as far as i can see has never been elected . 
  uk , restaurant i 'd typically tip 10-15 % assuming decent service ; bar/pub i 'm afraid is n't a tipping area though . 
  am aware of the us setup , so have typically gone 15-20 % there , except for one that got a zero ( only got menus after prompting after sitting there waiting for about 15 mins , then main courses arrived after another lengthy wait , then halfway through eating those the starters got plonked down without a hint of apology for the bizarre timing ) . 
  the bnp , with a similar number of candidates to the greens , got around twice as many votes last election . 
  should we include them , too ? 
  being ahead of the lib dems is less impressive than it sounds when that 's largely a factor of the lib dem polling numbers having collapsed . 
  the greens are still on the margins of 4-5 % . 
  you likely could n't remain an eu citizen , as you are only an eu citizen by dint of being a citizen of an eu member state . 
  if the uk remained within the [ eea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area ) , either indepedently or as part of efta ( assuming it were to rejoin that ) , you 'd still have the right to live and work wherever you like , as that 's an eea function rather than an eu one ( and thus you can also go and live and work in eg [ norway ] ( https://www.gov.uk/living-in-norway ) , despite it very definitely not being part of the eu ) . 
  it 's not really a normal citizenship , though ; it 's simply a function of your citizenship of an eu member state , and you ca n't independently give it up . 
  here 's a 2011 reuters report , then : http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/04/10/idinindia-56245120110410 and a later report from 2013 on a norwegian site noting that the veto was exercised , and noting the eu was threatening sanctions as a result : http://www.tnp.no/norway/politics/3497-eu-threatens-norway-with-sanctions you 're welcome to hunt for news stories of sanctions actually being imposed , though i 'll let you guess as to why you 've not heard of that happening . 
  the veto exists both in theory and in practice . 
   like who gives a fuck about postal directives people who care about their postal service - it 's that directive which is forcing eu countries to break up their existing state postal monopoly on letters under 50g , which it does n't take a genius to extrapolate to other companies coming in , scooping up profitable business in cities , and leaving the state company to deal with the unprofitable rural postal operations which used to be subsidised from operating profits in metropolitan areas ... 
   i think it 's time for britain to grab its toys and get the fuck out of the eu , they can be ruled by fax like norway if they do n't like the current arrangement . 
  actually overlooked this sentence originally ; the `` ruled by fax '' line is something of a nonsense , when norway retains a veto ( and has used it ) ; have a read of http://thefrogsalittlehot.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/eu-norway-and-bbc-bias.html for example . 
  yes , because look at the way it 's done . 
  you could , for example , say `` we 're going to adjust germany 's payments down by x % for the next two years , and greece 's payments will be adjusted up by y % over the same time '' . 
  or you could say `` greece , cough up a fat wad of cash and pay it over in a month 's time - germany , here you go '' . 
  which approach is more likely to piss people off ? 
  it is an assault when this is presented as a sudden `` hand over a fat wodge of cash by december '' . 
  there are dozens of ways this could 've been presented better , if this has been in the works for five years then perhaps phasing the change in payments over a similarly long time would 've been a good idea . 
  rather than providing free ammunition for the cause of euroscepticism across the continent . 
  perhaps someone should 've taken a minute to look at the fresh calculations , and ponder on whether the new methodology really does look fair , sane , and reasonable , when it 's asking greece to pay up more money so that germany can have some back . 
  it 's hard to think of a better way of fuelling the flames of euroscepticism . 
  you feel it 's fair to ask greece to pay more while giving money back to germany , then ? 
  greece is * also * being surcharged under these plans , while france and germany get rebates . 
  and greece gets a surcharge !, 
  seriously , take a look at this , people . 
  forget the uk . 
  ** greece ** is being asked to pay more , while france and germany get rebates . 
  when their calculations resulted in that , did nobody stop to ask `` hey , is n't this rather fucked up , did we make a mistake with designing the new methodology at all ? '', 
  guess where many of the refugees you see on the news at calais end up ... 
   i do n't know what gives the impression that russia is an unbeatable force of godhumans i do n't think anything was particularly giving that impression , it 's just the relative sizes of the russian , swedish , and finnish militaries are enough that raw numbers will overwhelm . 
  have a random bbc news clip , at the end you 'll hear the presenter refer to `` a mere fifty-five euros for the experience '' . 
  i disagree about the plural - uk usage is `` euros '' for the plural , as backed up by the [ guardian 's style guide ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-e ) :  ** euro **  currency ; plural euros and cents similarly the [ telegraph 's style book ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/about-us/style-book/1435311/telegraph-style-book-ee.html ) :  euro : the currency , plural euros . 
  and the [ bbc 's ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/journalism/article/art20130716140724183 ) :  ** euro **  the currency adopted by 17 eu member states ie ** lower case ** and never abbreviated . 
  we do ** not ** use the symbol for a euro . 
  the plural is ** euros **, 
  the article notes  juncker stressed , however , that , as merkel has said , much of the 300 billion euros should come from private investors and that the eu 's budget rules that limit the size of government deficits and public debt will not be weakened . 
  wonder how many private investors have a good chunk of $ 300bn they want to invest in europe via the eu ... 
  while it 's just a guess , the baltics are much smaller countries and probably still feel rather in russia 's shadow - i imagine there 's more incentive to really `` lock things in '' with the eu . 
  roughly a two year process via [ article 50 of the lisbon treaty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/withdrawal_from_the_european_union ) - should be enough time to discuss visa requirements i 'd hope !, 
  sure - but as the process of leaving is unlikely to be an overnight one , it seems reasonable to expect that terms would be negotiated where substantial numbers of citizens will be affected either way . 
  it 's hard to see an upside for spain in evicting thousands of british retirees , hence why i 'd expect them to sort something out so they can stay . 
  as long as ex-pats are spending their pensions in spain and not costing the spanish state money , i 'm not seeing a lot of obvious incentive for spain to make things difficult for them . 
  loss of cash , loss of influence ; the [ bbc 's report ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29646414 ) notes :  according to one source in the european parliament , the efdd group was due to get just over 4m euros ( # 3.2 m ; $ 5m ) in funding in 2015 - more than 80,000 euros per mep in the group . 
   for ukip , with 24 meps , that 's more than 2m euros of revenue hanging in the balance . 
  half of it usually goes to the communications budget - a valuable resource in an election year . 
   if mr farage is no longer the leader of a group , he will also get less speaking time in the parliament , and fewer opportunities to make speeches on big set-piece occasions . 
  those are ons figures , not tory - i 'd have as much faith in them as any government figures . 
  when that largest chain comprises a whole nine stores , though ... it 's not exactly * huge * . 
  http://www.lituanica.co.uk/store-finder ( needless to say , the nearest one is hundreds of miles from me , which explains me not having even been aware of this chain before now ), 
  those eurostat figures sound really odd . 
  the uk 's office of national statistics , in '' [ population by country of birth and nationality report , august 2014 ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_375449.pdf ) '' , thinks  polish is the most common non-british nationality in 2013 . 
  an estimated 726,000 usual residents of the uk have polish nationality ( 14.8 % of the total number of non-british nationals resident in the uk ) . 
  going to source data , which is in excel format : '' [ population by country of birth and nationality january 2013 to december 2013 ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/august-2014/rft-table-2---population-by-cob.xls ) '' ( note this will give a different number as it 's only up to dec last year , not august of this year ) , the top 20 countries of birth for non-uk births are : position | country | thousands -- | -- | -- 1 | india | 734 2 | poland | 679 3 | pakistan | 502 4 | republic of ireland | 376 5 | germany | 297 6 | south africa | 221 7 | bangladesh | 217 8 | united states of america | 199 9 | china | 191 10 | nigeria | 181 11 | france | 147 12 | jamaica | 147 13 | kenya | 142 14 | italy | 142 15 | lithuania | 140 16 | romania | 130 17 | sri lanka | 129 18 | philippines | 128 19 | australia | 112 20 | zimbabwe | 109, 
  going to have to query your uk numbers a bit !, 
  you suggest that irish and lithuanian immigrants are the top two , numbers from the 2011 uk census suggest there were [ 97,083 lithuanian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanians_in_the_united_kingdom ) and [ 521,000 polish-born ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poles_in_the_united_kingdom ) people in the uk . 
  anecdotally , i 've certainly seen several polish shops/delis around town , no lithuanian ones though !, 
   crapper phones that did nothing but make calls that 's actually why i specifically mentioned the blackberry - which was at least used for email and possibly some limited web browsing , * not * just calls . 
  thing is , the batteries * have * to have much greater capacities , because the big backlit colour touchscreens drain so much more power than the simple little mono lcds of the past . 
  you could get the best part of a week 's use out of older mono blackberries , for example - good luck getting more than a day or two out of the current ones , though . 
  i imagine because ireland 's nearer to the west coast . 
  people tend to put down roots , especially when they have children ; take a look at http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24869363, 
  did you read the article ? 
  belgium does n't elect three separate presidents , for example . 
  is it that surprising that a civil war generates a lot of refugees ? 
  it 's a wide banner , no reason it ca n't be shared . 
  you magnificent bastard . 
  go on then , show me it on http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ which has uk legislation from 1267 onwards . 
  reddit gold for you if you can find it . 
  according to the law commission , this is basically sheer bollocks . 
  it may not have ever been legal , and certainly is n't now . 
  from http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/docs/legal_oddities.pdf  it is illegal to shoot a welsh or scottish ( or any other ) person regardless of the day , location or choice of weaponry . 
  the idea that it may once have been allowed in chester appears to arise from a reputed city ordinance of 1403 , passed in response to the glynd\u0175r rising , and imposing a curfew on welshmen in the city . 
  however , it is not even clear that this ordinance ever existed . 
  sources for the other cities are unclear ; hereford , like chester , was frequently under attack from wales during the medieval period . 
   unlawful killings are today covered by the criminal law ; see also art . 
  2 of the european convention on human rights on the right to life . 
  that 's a picture of the big vow the three party leaders made , which was splashed over the front page of the daily record . 
  it 's genuine . 
  it would be useful to know how big the flag that appeared was . 
  i mean , if it was ( say ) 5cm wide , then complaining about 0.3 mm is being pretty petty . 
  if it was 2mm wide , then 0.3 mm 's a bit more understandable to complain about . 
  thanks for posting this - bulgarian politics is n't something i really know anything about , and having the quick ` idiot guide ' to the parties at the bottom is really useful . 
  there 've been suggestions in the past that the olympics should stay full-time in greece , their original home . 
  what a waste of a good cucumber . 
  a rough block of sandstone would do ... 
  yeah , i 'm sure i remember seeing nonsense about them complaining about places even using ' 2012 ' in their advertising , since it was the london 2012 olympics ... 
  you do realise that `` nothing '' is more than your country 's entire gdp ? 
  in context , it 's a hell of a lot . 
  what about the channel tunnel ? 
  i was assuming an average of 160km/h , not a top speed - i 'm assuming it 's unlikely the trains will be going full speed the whole time , and of course they have to slow down and stop for periods of time at stations or they are n't very useful , 
  oh , i agree it 's pretty horrible . 
  tell you what , [ femern 's site ] ( http://www.femern.com/home/preparation-phase/the-selection-of-the-immersed-tunnel/immersed-tunnel-vs-cable-stayed-bridge ) claims that `` in-depth planning revealed that both solutions would cost a similar amount '' - cable-stayed bridge vs immersed tunnel .
