  am fairly sure the armed forces also take pride in being professional forces , and do n't particularly * want * a load of conscripts . 
  interesting to see what an outlier the uk is , for ceasing conscription in 1960 ; looks like every other european nation with active military forces which does n't conscript only stopped in the 1990s or later ? 
  have n't ever been aware of men shaving their pits being a thing in the uk . 
  what a great image - what 's its original context ? 
  i imagine it 's more to do with the reduced amount of time to detect and intercept them . 
  the law commission [ had this to say ] ( http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/docs/legal_oddities.pdf ) ...  ** claim : ** it is legal to shoot a welshman with a longbow on sunday in the cathedral close in hereford ; or inside the city walls of chester after midnight ; or a scotsman within the city walls of york , other than on a sunday . 
   ** comment : ** it is illegal to shoot a welsh or scottish ( or any other ) person regardless of the day , location or choice of weaponry . 
  the idea that it may once have been allowed in chester appears to arise from a reputed city ordinance of 1403 , passed in response to the glynd\u0175r rising , and imposing a curfew on welshmen in the city . 
  however , it is not even clear that this ordinance ever existed . 
  sources for the other cities are unclear ; hereford , like chester , was frequently under attack from wales during the medieval period . 
   unlawful killings are today covered by the criminal law ; see also art . 
  2 of the european convention on human rights on the right to life most of the truly bonkers claimed laws are in fact myths - even the fabulous claim that `` in liverpool , it is illegal for a woman to be topless in public , except as a clerk in a tropical fish store '' . 
  why would they be ? 
  the uk 's had a continuous presence there since 1833 ; the [ first constitution of argentina was in 1853 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_argentina_of_1853 ) . 
  i wonder how much this will annoy the kremlin if it 's accurate - just knowing that the precise unit can ( and potentially has ) be narrowed down to by foreign non-governmental bodies . 
  i 'd never seen the [ nagorno-karabakh flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_nagorno-karabakh_republic ) before . 
  very `` 8-bit '' feel to it !, 
  it 's saying that * in * finland there 's an underlying threat . 
  since zoomers like isis exist , would you really want to rule out the possibility of a terrorist attack there ? 
  i love how this is the  the largest deployment of the multirole fighter to the continent and the actual number is : two jets . 
  just enough to qualify for a plural in the title . 
  thanks for posting that , it was a good watch !, 
  yep , also in that category are things like `` burning wood indoors '' , and `` being a hairdresser '' . 
  strictly speaking , the [ ecsc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_coal_and_steel_community ) was n't wound up till 2002 , too !, 
  odd that one says `` the euro is the eu 's currency '' , and then the second one very clearly shows that there are numerous currencies used in the eu !, 
  bit of a simplification , it was ecsc -  eec -  ec -  eu . 
  biting the pillow and dealing with it is of course a classic british boarding school tradition , 
  your dad lives in malta ? 
   backers of remain dismissed mr johnson 's remarks as `` nonsense '' , citing us membership of nato and trade bodies . 
  as though nato membership was anything like eu membership . 
  not really - as we 've seen before , the left will hold their noses and vote for the mainstream right candidate , in order to keep out the fn . 
  given that i imagine relatively few migrants speak hungarian , czech , polish , or slovak , i can imagine why the visegrad group are relatively on-board with this plan ... 
  they 've [ got their own song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inbxu-iy7cw ) and everything !, 
   such a proposal would likely not see the same cash minimum wage across all countries -- but instead see the wages match as a proportion of the cost of living . 
  that does n't really seem like it would do much to reduce incentives , does it ? 
  i mean , would you rather have an average-for-the-country living in a poor country , or a wealthy country ( with all due likelihood of better opportunities and facilities in the latter ) ? 
  we 'd more usually simply put uk rather than the full country name ; would ek ever be used in hungarian ? 
  or just nagy-britannia ( nb even ) ? 
  looks like it !, 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/name_of_the_czech_republic ) :  the renaming of the country in 1918 and 1993 was reflected in the majority of other languages , with only a few ( polish czechy , hungarian csehorsz\u00e1g , and bosnian , croatian , macedonian , serbian and slovene , \u010ce\u0161ka , etc. ), 
  retaining the form used previously for bohemia . 
  unlike english , other languages adopted the new short-forms such as tschechien in german , tsjechi\u00eb in dutch , tsjekkia in norwegian , tjeckien in swedish , tjekkiet in danish , \u010cesko in slovak , \u0427\u044d\u0445\u0456\u044f ( \u010cechija ) in belarusian , \u0427\u0435\u0445\u0456\u044f ( chekhiya ) in ukrainian , \u0427\u0435\u0445\u0438\u044f ( chekhiya ) in russian and bulgarian , \u010cekija in lithuanian , \u010cehija in latvian , cehia in romanian , cechia in italian , ch\u00e9quia / tch\u00e9quia in portuguese , chequia in spanish , tch\u00e9quie in french , t\u0161ekki in finnish , t\u0161ehhi in estonian , \u03a4\u03c3\u03b5\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 ( tsechia ) in greek , \u0549\u0565\u056d\u056b\u0561 ( zexia ) in armenian and \u00c7ekya in turkish . 
  did n't botch it at all , we avoided breaking up our multi-country country and saved ourselves from going around the u-bend of the economic toilet . 
  yep , as noted , [ north britain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_britain ) had a fair bit of historic use , unfashionable now though . 
  right enough , after a quick hunt around , it looks impossible to beat unless you allow taiwan 's title in the wto ( edited into earlier comment now ) . 
  `` north britain '' did actually have some traction in the 1800s - one of edinburgh 's biggest/best hotels was the north british for a long , long time ( relatively recently bought by forte group and renamed to the balmoral , presumably to confuse american tourists who 'll think they 're staying in something linked to the queen 's castle ) . 
  hm , are there no longer versions of something like the people 's democratic socialist republic of somewhereorother ? 
  edit : seems not , indeed !, 
  though taiwan did get admitted to the wto under the rather gloriously long title of `` the separate customs territory of taiwan , penghu , kinmen , and matsu ( chinese taipei ) '' ... 
  / sadface here in scotland . 
   unlike most european countries , the czech republic has lacked a one-word version of its name in foreign languages . 
  seems sort of ironic to carefully pick a single-word english country name when the largest english-speaking nation in europe is the two-word united kingdom ... 
  we might yet join you !, 
  i 'm reminded of the time that the guardian got its readers to write to residents of a particular county in ohio in an attempt to stop bush from being elected ... 
  it 's [ not exactly thought to have been a rip-roaring success ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3981823.stm ) ( the county swung to bush ) . 
   in my opinion norway should be very blue on this map if the map was extending to non-eu/candidate countries , i guess it would be . 
  norway 's very solidly in the efta camp tho !, 
  random observation ... no votes in this referendum : 2,526,081 votes for vvd in the last general election : 2,504,948 so `` no '' got the same sort of level of support as the pm 's party ( while of course being a different set of 2.5 million voters ) ... 
  so ... person a will pay person b for their time and company ( but explicitly not paying for sex ) , and if person b happens to fancy going to bed with person a that 's just a happy ending ? 
  can believe there 'd be some danes with that opinion - denmark 's traditionally been one of the more sceptical nations ( it 's the only one apart from the uk that has an official permanent euro opt-out ) , though i doubt there 's enough traction there to trigger a full-blown leave move . 
  largest fleet in history numerically might well be the d-day invasion fleet - you 're looking at over 5,000 vessels and 100,000 men . 
  probably just as well for us that zombie blas de lezo was n't there to guide the spanish ships :-), 
  looks like the spanish lost six ships too , the difference being that six ships is all they had there !, 
  still - he was the leader of the other side in a battle where the british were definitely the runners up . 
  i think we can agree that much . 
   in which the largest fleet in history was defeated while trying to capture one of the main cities in spanish america . 
  such was the magnitude of the battle that the english government forbade mentioning it and records were destroyed . 
  skimming the wikipedia entry , it appears to have been an attempted amphibious assault , and the cause of most casualties was disease rather than actual fighting ( which claimed the life of blas de lezo too ) . 
  the claim that it was forbidden to mention it and records were destroyed seems rather fanciful too ; news of the british failure caused the government at the time to collapse . 
  still , the battle was indeed a notable british defeat ; is anyone remotely surprised that a trolling attempt in the ship naming thingie has been removed ? 
  just the same as if it was spain naming a vessel , i 'd expect to see any attempt to name it the * treaty of utrecht * canned pretty quickly , 
   newcastle upon tyne - novocastrian the novocastr - bit is from the latin words for new ( novus ) and castle ( castra ) , and then - ian is a fairly common suffix ( per some of your other examples ) . 
  apples and oranges ; the eu is doing things that national states are n't , and national states are doing things the eu is n't . 
  when you say a baker in a supermarket , are we talking the sort of `` baker '' who basically defrosts some dough that 's been shipped in and bungs it in the oven ? 
  since [ that 's the sort of supermarket dodge we get here ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/8414653/the-truth-about-your-supermarket-loaf.html ) ... 
  i am inclined to suspect that although there are certainly craft markets making nice bread , the vast majority of bread sold in the usa will be plastic white stuff from places like walmart . 
  same happens here in the uk . 
  it might be a joke , but is n't it also the best-selling bread in the us ? 
  certainly appears to have been in 2010 : http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/americas-best-selling-brand-of-bread-introduces-wonderr-smartwhitetm-89392127.html, 
  depends on the foodstuff - it appears that taste got bred out of american tomatoes by accident , as they bred consistency of colour in : http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/06/how-tomatoes-lost-their-taste, 
  well , compare and contrast ingredients - for ease i 'll quickly bold the major ingredients before you get to the yeast ( at which point we 're into minor-quantity ingredients ) . 
  american [ wonder white ] ( http://www.walmart.com/ip/wonder-white-bread-18-oz/37827980 ) : ingredients : ** unbleached enriched flour ** ( wheat flour , malted barley flour , niacin , reduced iron , thiamin mononitrate , riboflavin , folic acid ) , ** water ** , ** high fructose corn syrup ** , contains 2 % or less of each of the following : yeast , salt , soybean oil , wheat gluten , dough conditioners ( contains one or more of the following : sodium stearoyl lactylate , calcium stearoyl lactylate , monoglycerides and/or diglycerides , calcium peroxide , calcium iodate , datem , ethoxylated mono - and diglycerides , azodicarbonamide , enzymes ) , soy flour , yeast food ( ammonium sulfate ) , monocalcium phosphate , calcium sulfate , soy , lecithin , calcium propionate ( to retard spoilage ) .

  probably easiest to drop the author a line at info@kiboke-studio.hr asking . 
  only because he does n't know upfront about every site in existence with a cookie warning !, 
  as he says ,  you can report any website which still warns you about cookies : make a right click and choose ` report a cookie warning ' from the menu . 
  which should then get tidied up for future ... 
  at least that managed to create a useful opportunity for someone . 
  namely to code the '' [ i do n't care about cookies ] ( http://www.kiboke-studio.hr/i-dont-care-about-cookies/ ) '' browser addon , so you do n't get those bloody alerts all the time ... 
  now you 're just making it difficult !, 
  i 'd say sites like http://www.euractiv.com/ were giving it a decent shot ? 
   i would argue that a creation of paneuropean media would actually cause people to care about what the eu does . 
  i think the counter to that is , people are still likely to prefer their local media , as it 'll be more focused on them and their area ( and it 's familiar ) . 
  bizarrely , it was apparently proposed in the 1950s : http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6261885.stm http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/15/france.eu, 
  how weird would a world where both the uk and france voted to leave the eu be ... heck , we could dust off those old merger plans !, 
  you do n't think it reflects more on the way that fptp penalises parties which get lots of second places ? 
  the tories got a little over 40 % of the vote in 1979 , 1983 , and 1987 ( and indeed 1992 iirc ) - their vastly differing majorities reflect how the opposition vote broke up . 
  i think / u/twogunsalute 's point was that scotland is a lost cause at the moment , and labour need to appeal to england , where the bulk of the seats they can theoretically win are . 
   going by labour 's core tenets , someone like corbyn is probably more appropriate . 
  people who are n't into that kind of straight left wing politics should vote lib dems and make them a serious contender .
