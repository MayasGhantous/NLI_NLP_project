  may i refer you to 1983 , where labour had a left-wing stance , the liberals in the centre did well , and the split opposition vote led to thatcher 's biggest win ? 
  i 'm not convinced it 's the difference that personalised results make . 
  at least , if i chuck an error message from a computer in as a search term , it 's hard to see how you can usefully personalise the results . 
  pain i found with that was that google was far better at returning useful results to me . 
  that 's the point , though , there is n't really a ` status quo ' option , since voting remain to stay in what the eu is now , is a bit like voting to stay in the eec in 1975 - you have no way of knowing what future governments will sign away . 
  all part of the weirdness of this campaign . 
  hey , remain campaign : what will things look like in five years if we vote to stay in ? 
  well , erm , that depends on many things and it 's impossible to say really . 
  hey , leave campaigns : what will things look like in five years if we vote to leave ? 
  well , erm , that depends on many things and it 's impossible to say really . 
  oh , it 's by no means guaranteed that a post-eu uk would seek to join it . 
  the point is , the question that was asked was `` where did people get the idea that you could n't travel or work in other countries without the eu ? '', 
  - and going on to illustrate the ease which the eea provides just goes to prove the point that the eu is * not * a requirement . 
  eea , of course , does not require eu membership ... 
  benefit for you is that you can `` look ahead '' and explore other places that you might visit . 
  say for example that you lived in innsbruck , and got an interview in graz . 
  can you see the convenience aspect in being able to pull up streetview , so that you can see what it 's going to look like when you come out of the train station , and visualise what your journey is going to look like as you go down a road or two before knowing what the building 's going to look like ? 
  there 's no * need * for us to be able to visit reddit , but we do because it 's interesting and fun . 
  just as it 's interesting and fun ( as well as useful ) to be able to virtually look around other cities . 
  as the top post in this thread says , `` google street is awesome when you have to go somewhere and you do n't know how the place looks like '' . 
  where 's the matching campaign to move , say , denmark onto gmt +2 ( which would similarly shunt it ahead of its ` natural ' time zone ) ? 
  seems daft to put your country into a timezone where mid-day is n't the middle of the day . 
  nothing 's stopping companies operating an 8-4 working day if they want ... 
  sure , ex-bnp voters have gone ukip - but so have ex-lib dem , ex-tory , ex-labour , and even a few ex-green voters ( and it 's not as though the bnp had a long history of electoral success in the uk either ) . 
  ukip has some ex-bnp voters . 
  that does not make it a neo-nazi far-right party , any more than ( say ) ex-communist voters flocking to jeremy corbyn 's labour party would make it a communist party . 
  ukip are n't extreme right like this lot - look at the european political party that lsns affiliate with , the '' [ alliance for peace and freedom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_for_peace_and_freedom ) '' . 
  the british member is nick griffin 's `` british unity '' , the greek contribution is golden dawn . 
  for that matter , do n't you ever have small kids sitting on their parents ' shoulders ? 
  they 'd be at a similar height ... 
  you do n't ever have taller vehicles like double decker buses , or indeed lorries , driving along ? 
  did seem utterly bogglesome for people to complain about the view from the street being put online - it 's nothing that people ca n't already see , and it 's incredibly useful . 
  if i recall rightly vanguard did n't go easily either !, 
  while i guess it 's understandable that money was short and priorities were n't on preserving old warships , it 's an incredible shame that not one of our major ships from world war 2 survives at all ( hms belfast , though the right vintage , is only a light cruiser after all !, 
  why would you * not * say hms warspite ? 
  she had the most battle honours ever awarded to an individual ship in the royal navy and the most awarded for actions during the second world war , whereas hms vanguard - attractive as she was - was n't even commissioned until after ww2 finished . 
  which makes me very surprised that answer does n't appear stronger for the uk . 
  we 're a lazy bunch when it comes to learning languages , which i think is largely down to the fact there 's a damn good chance that wherever we go someone will speak english anyway . 
  an amusing rant , but he does n't half pack in the obsolete units ( literally centuries obsolete ) . 
  yoinking from [ here ] ( https://www.socialeurope.eu/2016/02/a-critique-of-yanis-varoufakis-democracy-in-europe-movement-diem25/ ) ( and yes , that * also * would have been useful to mention in the article !, 
  ) ,  the movement 's goal is ` to convene a constitutional assembly where europeans will deliberate on how to bring forward , by 2025 , a fully fledged european democracy , featuring a sovereign parliament that respects national self-determination and shares power with national parliaments , regional assemblies and municipal councils ' . 
  would it have killed the guardian to explain the name ? 
  it 's apparently the ** d ** emocracy ** i ** n ** e ** urope ** m ** ovement 20 ** 25 ** . 
  end of the [ thirty years ' war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years'_war ) , maybe ? 
   what would be your plan to regain prosperity outside of eu ? 
  traditionally , nations would 've been able to devalue their own currency to boost exports . 
  for obvious reasons , not an option any more . 
  english is also an official language of ireland and malta . 
  opening paragraph of wikipedia ( yes , yes , i know it 's not the be-all and end-all ) for sovereign state suggests :  in international law , a sovereign state is a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralized government that has sovereignty over a geographic area . 
  international law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population , defined territory , one government , and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states . 
  it is also normally understood that a state is neither dependent on nor subject to any other power or state . 
  could we honestly say that applies completely to eu member states ? 
  at best you start discussing ` pooled sovereignty ' i think . 
  impossible to know for certain , but that plane is known to have conducted rendition flights before , and the location and timing have led others to assume it was snowden related in this instance too . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rendition_aircraft#n596ga.2fn977ga.2fn996ga - which references this copenhagen post story : http://cphpost.dk/news/documents-confirm-rendition-flight-used-copenhagen-airport-for-mission-to-capture-edward-snowden.html, 
  i love that they include  he was elected rector at the university of glasgow in february 2014 , yet is unable to fully carry out his duties . 
  as though anyone at the time he was elected thought there was a snowball 's chance in hell that he ever would , 
  i think / u/super _ set was meaning what 's mentioned in the article ,  pis has repeatedly said it would rather see the deal awarded to a producer manufacturing locally . 
  both sikorsky and agustawestland have facilities in poland . 
  the implication i get from that is that airbus does n't , and pis would prefer that their helicopter manufacturing contributed to polish jobs ? 
  twelve !, 
  reminds me of [ this skit from red dwarf ] ( https://youtu.be/xmfytons6ua?t=96 ) ... 
  just looked , the existence of the wikipedia article [ time -- manner -- place ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/time%e2%80%93manner%e2%80%93place ) makes me think i 'm remembering right . 
  have to admit i 'm not at all familiar with croatian - i had in mind rules that were drilled into me many years ago at school , like in german the sentence must run time-manner-place ; `` i went at two o'clock by car to the station '' right , `` i went to the station by car at two o'clock '' wrong . 
  could be i 'm mistaken on that too , of course !, 
  castle / ch\u00e2teau , war / guerre are two more for the s / ^ w/gu examples ; sadly i 'm not aware of whatever word it is that describes these ... something like shared root , maybe ? 
  exactly !, 
  to do with the way we borrowed sounds , apparently : http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=gu -, 
  really ? 
  * she said to me that she was lonely * to me , she said that she was lonely * she was lonely , she said to me while the first of those might sound more ` natural ' , both of the other two can easily be understood as having the same meaning . 
  you know , now you mention it , i think i knew that . 
  french teacher of mine many years ago showed us how similar some english and french words can be , despite not looking at all similar . 
  in particular , i remember him showing us wasp / gu\u00eape . 
  once you accept that an english w can relate to a french g ( think names like william/guillaume , as in the norman chap who came over here with some of his mates in 1066 ) , and the ^ is an s , you can see both came from the same root . 
  possibly - wikipedia 's article notes  a circumflex accent can be generated by first striking the ^ key ( located to the right of p in most azerty layouts ) , then the vowel requiring the accent ( with the exception of y ) . 
  for example , pressing ' ^ ' then ` a ' produces ' \u00e2 ' . 
  i certainly recall one of those on \u00eatre , the ` to be ' verb . . though of course it 's an irregular verb and almost none of the conjugates ( is that the right word ? 
  the bits like je ** suis ** , tu ** es ** , il ** est ** ) use it . 
  might relate to english being very relaxed about grammar , so you can shuffle around words within a sentence and it 'll still sound ` right ' ? 
  okay , so i can guess that taigh is scots gaelic , hoose is scots , t\u0177 is welsh and chy is presumably cornish , while house is the regular english . 
  what the heck language is h\u016bs ? 
  as frustrating a situation as they must be in , it ca n't have escaped their attention that there are rather a lot of asylum seekers in germany right now , and so it 's not surprising the whole process slows down . 
  forcing a snap decision feels like it 'd be more likely to push a ` no ' answer , as if the agency 's not been able to satisfy itself the application is valid ( which it might do with more time ) , then the only responsible thing it can do is reject ? 
  historic ? 
  that 's the current status of the [ kingdom of the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_the_netherlands ) . 
  so you know better than , for example , the [ law library of the us congress ] ( https://www.loc.gov/law/help/legal-research-guide/uk.php ) ? 
   the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland is the collective name of four countries , england , wales , scotland and northern ireland . 
  or the [ commonwealth ] ( http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/united-kingdom ) ? 
   the uk is a union of four countries : england , scotland , wales and northern ireland . 
  or the [ european union ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/eures/main.jsp?lang=en&amp;acro=eures&amp;catid=2114&amp;countryid=uk&amp;langchanged=true ) ? 
   the united kingdom is made up of four countries : england , scotland , wales and northern ireland . 
  for someone with said masters , you seem very careless about language . 
   the definition of a state is clearly defined . 
  there 's no ranking in types of state . 
  it 's binary , state or no state . 
  really ? 
  could you point us to this definition ? 
  and you 'd put - for example - tennessee on the same level as ireland , because there 's no ranking ? 
  no difference between a federated state and a nation state ? 
  you might cast an eye over things like the wikipedia article on [ country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/country ) , too , which kicks off with :  a country is a region that is identified as a distinct entity in political geography .
