  a country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state , as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division , or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics . 
  regardless of the physical geography , in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the league of nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the united nations in 1945 , a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction . 
  you 'll note that scotland has its own legal jurisdiction , which is quite separate from that in england and wales . 
  there 's another nearby example of a nation state being made of multiple constituent countries , the kingdom of the netherlands - which is comprised of aruba , cura\u00e7ao , sint maarten and the netherlands . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charter_for_the_kingdom_of_the_netherlands :  the charter for the kingdom of the netherlands ( in dutch : * statuut voor het koninkrijk der nederlanden * ; in papiamentu : * statuut pa e reino di hulanda * ) describes the political relationship between the four different countries which form the kingdom of the netherlands, 
  scotland is a country , but not a sovereign state . 
  feels like a natural shortening of pole-land , though . 
  completely agree - do n't remove from the historical picture , add to it . 
  iirc he was nicknamed ` fatty pang ' by the chinese while he was the last governor of hong kong . 
  which led to paul merton 's observation on have i got news for you that he had n't known that ` pang ' was chinese for ` wanker ' . 
  sounds doubly exempt then - it 's not worth more than the threshold , and even if it was , it 's a ` sentimental item ' . 
  sadiq apparently advocates shutting it down , per the op 's article :  khan has also come under attack for his claims to be able to freeze fares without cutting investment in the transport system . 
  his claim to be able to save money by ** shutting down the little-used east london cable car ** , fell apart after tfl released figures suggesting the service now actually makes a small surplus . 
  closing the cable car would also force tfl to incur heavy penalty costs for breaking their deal with the sponsors emirates . 
  quote from tfl in a [ fairly sceptical piece here ] ( http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/business-news/london-transport/scrutinising-boris-johnsons-cable-car-project-is-it-a-complete-failure/10886.article ) says :  `` we plan to pay back the initial investment within its first ten years of operating . 
  all operating surplus raised will be reinvested back into the transport network . '', 
  [ the profits appear in transport for london 's accounts ] ( http://www.mayorwatch.co.uk/boriss-vanity-cable-car-likely-to-stay-open-until-2021-after-tfl-accounts-show-it-makes-a-profit/ ) . 
   furthermore an analysis of transport for london 's audited accounts show that , instead of receiving a `` subsidy '' , the scheme 's fare revenue met or exceeded operating costs in each of the last three financial years . 
   in its first nine months of operation , the period covered by tfl 's 2012/13 accounts , just under two million passengers were carried , generating fares revenue of # 6m . 
   during 2013/14 passengers numbers , which were boosted the previous year by the scheme 's novelty and london 's hosting of the olympics , fell to 1.5 million passengers with fare revenue of # 5m . 
   passenger numbers remained flat in 2014/15 at 1.5 million but revenue increased from # 5 million to # 6 million . 
  seems oddly stupid to fixate on closing the cable car if it 's actually turning a profit - so what if it 's only shifting 1.5 million people , if it 's doing that and making money then surely it makes sense to keep it open ?

  best of luck with the future mate !, 
  lucky bugger , petrol 's down around there in edinburgh now , but diesel 's still around # 1.03, 
  as it is , it 's getting pretty close to the magical figure of # 1 a litre ... 
  irrelevant - scotland is not a member state of the eu . 
  the member state is the uk ; the uk has a conservative government .

  not even close to that much , the article cites it as 0.015 km ^ 2 insignificant amount of pointy land to norway , new awesome high peak for finland .

  ok , so if you 're closely partnered with nato forces , and do n't expect russia to want a war , and want to be purely defensive ... who the heck are you envisaging actually using your army against ? 
  by that time it seems like a bit of a waste of money - iceland 's current deal is a better one , 
   coalition forces had a vast superior airforce please tell me about what potential threats to a nordic federation you 're imagining that would n't also have a massively superior air force ? 
  edit : though fair comment on the coalition numbers , had n't recalled them being that high . 
  still shows that huge numbers on the ground do n't necessarily count for much in a proper war scenario these days . 
   finland can field an army of 450,000 men which is enough to defend the entire border but the french and british have been lowering their military power since ww2 . 
  [ just before ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/03/world/iraq-chief-boasting-of-poison-gas-warns-of-disaster-if-israelis-strike.html ) the first persian gulf war ...  baghdad 's military is the most powerful and most battle-tested arab army , according to western experts in baghdad . 
  iraq has around one million men under arms and more tanks and combat aircraft than israel , the specialists said . 
  pretty sure you 'll find the result was that army was crushed by coalition forces of considerably less than a million ... 
  winter war and continuation war - both are ww2 era , when soviet forces were very definitely conscript based too . 
  defending home terrain when weather conditions are poor is generally a solid bet though ( see also : nazi invasion of soviet union in ww2 ) . 
  if you seriously think that finland 's current military would be able to fight a `` proper war '' while the likes of france and the uk could n't , then i honestly do n't know what to say while remaining polite other than to suggest i feel you are `` misguided '' to say the least . 
  nice of you to mention sweden , i assume you 're aware that [ they 've ended conscription there ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/eu-nations-continue-to-phase-out-military-conscription/a-5749541 ) ? 
  and yes , america also * had * conscription - why do you think they got rid of it ? 
  some food for thought [ here ] ( http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/rb9195/index1.html ) . 
  just look at who uses volunteer militaries . 
  usa , uk , france , germany , netherlands , canada , et al. 
  whether you 're attacking or defending , you 'll do better with a professional volunteer army than a conscript army . 
   why should they have an army full of professionals ? 
  because you wanted them to be  one of the leading military defense powers in the world, 
  why would you want forced conscription , and what makes you think it would make the nf `` one of the leading military defense powers in the world '' ? 
  the world 's best militaries are the ones where it 's volunteers serving as a career , not everyone in a given age bracket serving whether they want to or not . 
  anything trying to show `` cheap '' which selects london in the uk has failed . 
  london has many wonderful things in it , but cheap prices are sure as hell not one of them . 
  and to be honest edinburgh 's probably the costliest city in scotland , too . 
  their track record in things like the six day war and the yom kippur war does rather give credence to / u/smartman3000 's father ( particularly as his father was presumably active in that era ) . 
  why fixate on one language , when you have a second which is just as much your own - the irish accent and dialect of english are distinctive , and iirc it 's considered about the most attractive accent for english to be in !, 
  what , we 're feeling the need to cosy up and demonstrate that we do n't really mind about russia invading various neighbouring nations ? 
  per [ this news piece ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/scottish-independence-scots-reject-euro-currency-back-alex-salmonds-demand-pound-1460812 ) , 7 % of scots favoured joining the euro in an independent scotland ( vs 11 % for a new currency , 79 % for the pound sterling ) . 
  yep , to join the euro you have to participate in erm ii first , and rather brilliantly that 's not mandatory to join . 
  this is how sweden 's still outside the euro despite lacking a formal opt-out . 
  essentially , it 's mandatory to join the euro , but to do that you have to be in the erm ii for a period of time , which . . is n't mandatory . 
  so it 's fairly easy to indefinitely disqualify yourself , by simply not participating in erm ii . 
  so do they want the gem returned to the descendants of the maharajah of lahore ?

  he patented it ( u.s. nos .

  per [ this article in the irish examiner ] ( http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/brexit-would-slash-irish-uk-trade-by-20-363202.html ) , it 's about 20 % of irish-uk trade . 
  some `` pittance '' . 
   ireland being the only english speaking country in the eu english is one of the two official languages in malta too ( though i acknowledge malta 's not exactly a large country ) . 
  not very useful , since the comparison is between northern ireland and the republic ; your map does n't have a figure for ni , just an average one for the whole uk - and / u/ewannnn already pointed out that ni 's average is much lower than that for the uk as a whole .

  alternate version quickly done in excel 2013 ( which inverts the order of the groupings ) , which i think gives a better idea of the relative numbers of votes too ( since the original chart looks quite close , whereas it 's not really - 411 against and 231 in favour ) : http://i.imgur.com/m4ycrzx.png,

  scottish gaelic self-refers simply as g\u00e0idhlig too - the roots of the language , and the gaelic people , rather pre-date either the kingdom of ireland or kingdom of scotland . 
  i 'm not trying to say that samhain is n't / was n't a big thing in ireland - i 'm trying to make the point that it 's not specific to just the people who were resident in ireland at the time , it relates to the gaels in general , who were spread rather more widely . 
  your article describes samhain as a gaelic festival ( and gaelic is not completely synonymous with irish ) . 
  and referring back to the heavily referenced halloween article , there 's no certainty that halloween is purely ( or at all ) derived from samhain :  according to many scholars , all hallows ' eve is a christianized feast influenced by celtic harvest festivals , [ 1 ] [ 12 ] with possible pagan roots , particularly the gaelic festival samhain . 
  [ 7 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] other scholars maintain that it originated independently of samhain and has solely christian roots . 
  [ 1 ] [ 15 ] it 's probably fair to say that samhain has ( potentially heavily ) influenced halloween , but it 's not an * irish * ( ie relating purely to ireland ) festival , it 's a * gaelic * ( ie relating to the gaels , who were spread wider than just the island of ireland ) one . 
  `` the russian bear is snoozing . 
  shall we leave it be , or poke it with a stick ? '', 
  it 's a * [ scots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scots_language ) * word !, 
  from the article you link , we find that the word halloween is of scots origin ...  the word halloween or hallowe'en dates to about 1745 [ 26 ] and is of christian origin . 
  [ 27 ] the word `` halloween '' means `` hallowed evening '' or `` holy evening '' . 
  [ 28 ] it comes from a scottish term for all hallows ' eve ( the evening before all hallows ' day ) . 
  [ 29 ] in scots , the word `` eve '' is even , and this is contracted to e ` en or een . 
  over time , ( all ) hallow ( s ) e ( v ) en evolved into halloween .
