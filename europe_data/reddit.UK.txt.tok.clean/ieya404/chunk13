  although the phrase `` all hallows ' '' is found in old english ( ealra h\u0101lgena m\u00e6ssed\u00e6g , all saints mass-day ) , `` all hallows ' eve '' is itself not seen until 1556 . 
  [ 29 ] [ 30 ] ... and the precursor festivals look to have been gaelic/celtic rather than specifically irish ( thus giving the scots a shout , and potentially wales/cornwall too ) ? 
  as-is , russia does n't look particularly likely to invade either , and is a major trade partner of finland iirc . 
  general judgement is that in that position it 's just not worth upsetting russia i think . 
  when you share a honking long land border with them , and [ already had land annexed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karelian_question_in_finnish_politics ) ... it 's perhaps understandable to want to smooth things over with them . 
  it 's not as though russia looks any less able or willing to annex other countries ' territory of late . 
  interesting how in the southern four merged regions , the new capital is the most central of the options . 
  in the three in the north , the capital 's the least central one ( where caen , amiens , and metz look like they 'd have been more convenient location-wise for their whole region ) . 
  do n't you think that it 's in france 's interests to ensure that trade with the uk is facilitated , so you can easily sell us all the things you produce - all those wines , cheeses , peugeots and citroens , michelin tyres , and all the other myriad of things that you make ? 
  it would hardly benefit french workers and industry to have their sales made more difficult , would it ? 
  true . 
  but if you read through that leaflet , do you honestly come away with much sense of `` well , this is a move towards a superstate that we 'll be a small federal part of '' ? 
  looking at that leaflet though - nobody was talking about the treaty of rome , and it 's mostly termed the common market ( obviously the european union was a faraway dream at that point ) . 
  if you look through the [ wording of the actual leaflet ] ( http://www.harvard-digital.co.uk/euro/pamphlet.htm ) the government put out in the 1975 referendum , though , you get passages like  there was a threat to employment in britain from the movement in the common market towards an economic & monetary union . 
  this could have forced us to accept fixed exchange rates for the pound , restricting industrial growth and putting jobs at risk . 
  this threat has been removed . 
  and  t is the council of ministers , and not the market 's officials , who take the important decisions . 
  these decisions can be taken only if all the members of the council agree . 
  the minister representing britain can veto any proposal for a new law or a new tax if he considers it to be against british interests . 
  ministers from the other governments have the same right to veto . 
  ( the national vetos are largely long gone now , of course ) i think it 's fair to say that the focus in 1975 was on very different things , and the results of a referendum whose electorate has now largely passed on - the absolute youngest voters in '75 are now 58 , after all ) are not overly indicative of the feelings of today 's uk . 
  if you 're going to quote churchill , you might as well include snippets like  where do we stand ? 
  we are not members of the european defence community , nor do we intend to be merged in a federal european system . 
  we feel we have a special relation to both . 
  this can be expressed by prepositions , by the preposition `` with '' but not `` of '' -- we are with them , but not of them . 
  though honestly , quoting * any * long-dead politician with an attempt to be relevant to today 's eu - which is far beyond anything known twenty years ago , nevermind forty - is a bit pointless anyway . 
  apparently the exit polls suggest the governing coalition 's about 7 % ahead : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34436674, 
  i think the us is a bit more vulnerable to public opinion , and will pay a bit more attention to human rights . 
  putin 's russia , on the other hand , i feel is more likely to just do what it feels it needs to , to get the job done . 
  that 's the daft thing , if everyone paid for it in their tax , it 'd cost * less * than it 's costing at the moment to buy healthcare coverage individually . 
  i mean , nobody seriously complains about paying taxes to get things of public benefit like roads , or policing , do they ? 
  so why 's healthcare different ? 
  surely you mean the times is clearly the only one worth its salt , since who 'd rank that dump cambridge ahead of oxford ? 
   ( why yes , i * have * been to oxford ( albeit a non graduate ) - why do you ask ? ), 
  the us 's system is , as far as i know , unique in the world . 
  not one other country has looked at it and gone `` wow , that 's a good idea , let 's copy that '' . 
  you spend hideously large sums of money on healthcare , and you do n't get the best results in return , either . 
  you could copy more or less any western european healthcare system , pay less , and get better results . 
  do n't get me wrong , i do like the usa - but on healthcare , i just ca n't get my head around why anyone would want to inflict such a system on their fellow citizens . 
  norway does have pretty stinging taxes on new cars , i think ? 
  base level mustang here in the uk starts at the equivalent of ~ us$ 45,000 . 
  ... what an irritating pile of * scheisse * that is !, 
  is that , your local sites just charge more for 18-rated products ? 
  or is there a specific `` 18 + $ 5 charge '' thing ? 
  true , if finances are really tight , then you 'd need a bloody good reason to pick a london university anyway !, 
  the student in this example 's flying in and out once a week too . 
  as before - if saving some money is worth fannying around getting out of town to the airport an hour or so in advance , going through airport security before twiddling your thumbs in the departure lounge for a while before getting onto a flight that dumps you at london luton where you then have to take a ten minute bus trip to get to the railway station before spending another half hour or so getting into the city ... then fair enough . 
  it 's not a choice i 'd want to make though !, 
  am i right in thinking that most other parties would n't consider working with jobbik anyway , thus making fidesz 's position in power incredibly safe at the moment ? 
  from a [ piece on conservativehome ] ( http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2016/11/calm-down-dears-article-50-is-still-going-to-happen.html?utm_campaign=twitter&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitter ) :  anyone who thinks mps will reject article 50 in such a vote is deluding themselves . 
  the overwhelming majority of the parliamentary conservative party now wants to get on with implementing the outcome of the referendum , regardless of which side they were on in the campaign . 
  a pleasantly surprising number of labour mps have also taken on board the message from their leave-voting constituencies . 
  having gone through the unpleasant experience of being at loggerheads with their voters on the doorstep , they rightly do n't want to defy them now they have spoken . 
  the referendum may have been advisory , but its advice was clear -- and when seen in pseudo-first past the post terms , ie in terms of mps ' constituencies , leave won a two thirds majority . 
  ultimately , de facto sovereignty lies with the electorate , and politicians value their seats . 
  it 's not set in stone , certainly , but writing it off is very premature . 
  ironic that you post this old myth in a thread discussing myths !, 
   it is illegal to shoot a welsh or scottish ( or any other ) person regardless of the day , location or choice of weaponry . 
  the idea that it may once have been allowed in chester appears to arise from a reputed city ordinance of 1403 , passed in response to the glynd\u0175r rising , and imposing a curfew on welshmen in the city . 
  however , it is not even clear that this ordinance ever existed . 
  sources for the other cities are unclear ; hereford , like chester , was frequently under attack from wales during the medieval period . 
   unlawful killings are today covered by the criminal law ; see also art . 
  2 of the european convention on human rights on the right to life . 
  source : http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/legal_oddities.pdf  the law commission is the statutory independent body created by the law commissions act 1965 to keep the law under review and to recommend reform where it is needed . 
   relaunched some five years after the original framework failed to gain unanimous approval by member states okay , so this will need unanimous support ? 
   this will inevitably mean that smaller countries such as ireland and luxembourg will miss out compared to larger economies such as france and germany the thought occurs it 'll need some serious sweeteners , then , before smaller countries vote against their own interests ? 
  as far as i 've seen , there 's been no indication from the eu27 that they 'd be prepared to bend at all on free movement - all or nothing has seemed to be the position . 
  seems unlikely : http://openeurope.org.uk/daily-shakeup/yougov-poll-no-evidence-of-regrets-after-brexit-vote/, 
  worth noting that had this 50 % turnout rule been in place for hungary 's referendum to join the eu , that would 've failed too ( [ 45.6 % turnout ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_european_union_membership_referendum,_2003 ) ) . 
  you 'd imagine that he 'd feel like a complete knob to find he has jewish heritage after being so anti-semitic in the past . 
  then again , following a certain little operation , he 's not going to be a * complete * knob any more . 
  i think you 'd need to be ' [ a moron in a hurry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_moron_in_a_hurry ) ' ( to use the legal phrase ) to confuse the two . 
  hard to see the grounds for confusion , though , unless iceland ( the country ) is planning on going into business with a chain of supermarkets primarily selling frozen food ? 
  common words ... you mean like windows \u2122 ? 
  if i recall rightly , the whole ` metric martyrs ' thing a few years ago was the result of eu regulations being used ( and implemented via the 1973 european communities act ) to over-rule the 1985 weights and measures act ( which is unusual , because normally the newer law takes precedence ) ? 
  it * is * eu regulations that 've enforced metric 's usage , though there 's no arguing that metric measurements are easier to work with given they 're all multiples of ten . 
  that said , you still ca n't beat a nice pint . 
  500ml just does n't quite cut it . 
  i think that 'd be the normal reaction ... start walking and put your thumb out hopefully when you hear a car . 
  that 's the real killer , the snippet that our hitch-hiker did n't even have the nous to stand somewhere that cars could a ) see him and b ) easily stop ... 
  presumably it 's the difference between a 50 % +1 majority that gives them control , and something like a 2/3 majority that lets them amend the constitution too ? 
  schengen 's an interesting parallel to draw from , given that not all eu members participate in it , and it includes non-eu participants . 
  rather like nato ... 
  tories survived with 165 out of 659 seats ( 25 % ) - if labour get 150 seats out of 600 they 're no worse off . 
  sure , any quick and dirty prediction based on uniform swings is always going to be pretty salt-laden - i just suspect predictions of total labour annihilation are a bit over-wrought . 
  whether they 're at 200 or 150 mps , they 'll be a minority , but solid enough . 
  sure , it 's on their home page : http://electoralcalculus.co.uk/homepage.html . . and arse , that * does n't * seem to be using the new boundaries . 
  their calculations shown on this page - http://electoralcalculus.co.uk/boundaries2018.html - suggest the effect of the boundary changes will be another 22 or so seats to the tories , though . 
  so labour potentially in a weaker position than hague was in '97 - but still , hague 's shown how you can be outnumbered in mp terms by more than two to one and still survive and eventually recover as a party . 
  no , if anything it 's un-gerrymandering ; the boundary commission ( independent ) has been given requirements ( 600 seats , a couple of island constituencies have to be on their own , apart from that every constituency needs to have within 5 % of the number of voters as any other seat ) . 
  they publish their proposals , public and parties can respond to those and make suggestions , commission can consider those and * may * incorporate them , commission then finalises boundaries and those are what gets used . 
  today 's electoral calculus prediction has the tories winning 375 seats , and labour 188 . 
  compare with 1997 , when blair 's labour won 418 , to major 's conservatives on 165 . 
  the tories still managed to fulfil the role of her majesty 's opposition . 
  aye , so many that i really wish the black dividing lines were thinner ( or even absent ) in the map !, 
   the concerns of luxembourg are vastly different from those of poland . 
  is n't that an argument against a common european army too , then ? 
  look at the differences in what 's spent . 
  nato have a target of 2 % of gdp to be spent on defence . 
  the usa spends 3.62 % of its already large gdp on defence .
