  italy spends just 0.95 % . 
  ( edit : apologies , old figure - it 's a little over 1 % now - still , you get the idea ! ), 
  imagine how much more clout italy would have if it even met that 2 % target ( which would mean more than doubling defence spending ) !, 
  coupled with actions like joining the soft-eurosceptic ecr grouping in the european parliament , you mean ? 
  i 'll concede that i 'm just looking at english-language sources , but i 'm consistently seeing them described as eurosceptic regardless of the source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_and_justice  the party is solidarist and mildly ** eurosceptic ** . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/25/poland-lurches-to-right-with-election-of-law-and-justice-party  poland has consolidated its rightwing shift after exit polls showed voters had handed an absolute majority in its parliamentary election to law and justice , a ** eurosceptic ** party that is against immigration , wants family-focused welfare spending and has threatened to ban abortion and in-vitro fertilisation . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/11954733/who-are-polands-victorious-law-and-justice-party-and-what-do-they-want.html  law and justice are usually denounced as nutty catholic reactionary right-wingers by the chattering classes within poland and around europe . 
  in fact they are a sui generis movement of truculent , carefully ** eurosceptic ** \u00e9tatist-patriots . 
  http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-poland-election-idukkcn0sj00h20151026  poland 's ** eurosceptic ** opposition conservatives , the law and justice party ( pis ) , won sunday 's general election , preliminary official results showed on monday , as the country shifted towards nationalism and left-leaning economics . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34648575  correspondents say the ** eurosceptic ** law and justice ( pis ) party , led by jaroslaw kaczynski , succeeded in attracting votes from people who feel excluded from the country 's economic growth . 
  http://www.euronews.com/2015/10/26/poland-s-eurosceptic-law-and-justice-party-wins-election  run by jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of poland 's late president lech the ** eurocosceptic ** pis has unseated the incumbent pro eu civic platform after eight years . 
  http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/poland-hard-right-law-justice-party-destroying-few-lgbt-rights-that-exist-1564620  the ** eurosceptic ** , fundamentalist roman catholic law and justice party is not reticent about its anti-gay views . 
  https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-europe/news/vote-count-confirms-outright-majority-for-polish-eurosceptics/  vote count confirms outright majority for polish ** eurosceptics **, 
  would be interested to read a counter-argument to the ` myth ' ; as far as i 'm aware the largest party in poland ( pis ) is soft-eurosceptic , and see articles like this on the bbc 's site : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36331903, 
  no , overall public spending in scotland is considerably higher than in other parts of the uk , which reflects the higher costs of providing public services to a population that 's extremely thinly spread once you get beyond the central belt ( where roughly 75 % of scotland 's population lives ) . 
  no worries - while they probably temper idealism a little to reflect the realities of british politics , they 've been solidly pro-europe for a long time . 
  ( indeed , their predecessors the liberals were calling for us to join the european coal and steel community , * way * back ) . 
  they were in favour of the uk joining the euro back in the day , do you not even give them credit for that ? 
   and not a single party in the political establishment is pro-eu . 
  you do n't think the [ lib dems are pro-eu ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/lib-dems-pledge-british-return-eu-next-general-election ) ? 
   the liberal democrats will fight the next general election with a pledge to take britain back into the eu , claiming the referendum result was secured on a campaign of lies . 
  you feel that a nobel prize-winning american economist would carefully pander to a eurosceptic audience by the cunning tactic of writing for a pro-eu british newspaper ? 
  now , what odds on a secondary market emerging , where italian students will offer to get someone $ 500 worth of books for just $ 450 of hard cash ? 
  [ stiglitz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_stiglitz ) is american , not a brit . 
  sadly , not a one - they got two fourth places , but no medals : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvia_at_the_2016_summer_olympics, 
  how about medals per athlete ? 
  culling numbers from [ here ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/olympics/2016/08/21/rio-2016-alternate-medal-table-how-countries-rank-when-we-adjust/ ) , and then trimming out countries beyond the top 5 + china that are n't ( more or less ) in europe ...

  that 's not making it more complicated , it 's just simplifying it by no longer flagging things up as mistakes !, 
  no dirt intended to be thrown !, 
  it was more of a curious question , as the article does n't address operating costs , and i know that other attempts to run fast breeders have n't been commercially successful ( the uk had one at dounreay , also long-closed now ) . 
  if russia can make it work - then that 's great !, 
  wonder whether it 'll be anywhere close to cost effective to operate - the last fast breeder in europe , france 's [ superph\u00e9nix ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superph%c3%a9nix ) , was closed because of the excessive costs . 
  wonder if france would consider giving up on shunting the european parliament to strasbourg if they got some nice agency there ? 
   stocking shelves 30h/week wo n't give you any useful experience iirc this was targeted at folk who 'd been out of the labour market for a long time , so as trivial as it seems , even this would give experience of regularly attending a workplace at a set time and being active for several hours . 
  having been on the dole myself many years ago , i know * i * certainly managed to get out of the habit of getting out of bed ( or indeed into it ) at fixed times ... 
  there * were * more lines - the point is that they were bleeding red ink and were n't sustainable . 
  the gleneagles-crieff-comrie line for example had had ten trains a day and five passengers on average earning only 25 % of costs . 
  trains make sense when you have a reasonably high volume of people to move around regularly , as the infrastructure is relatively costly and ca n't be shared with other modes of transport ; the highlands simply do n't have the population density to sustain it . 
  realistically , what would a network across the highlands achieve ? 
  you 'd have relatively high maintenance costs ( long distances , non-flat terrain ) , and you 're serving a small and thinly spread population ( something like 75 % of scotland 's population is in the central belt ) . 
  we * have * seen investment in new lines ( or rather , re-opening some old lines ) - eg the borders railway , which effectively gives a commuter route into edinburgh - it still needs that major city to anchor it to though . 
  they have quotas :  under the current arrangement , liechtenstein issues 56 residence permits for economically active and 16 permits to economically non-active persons each year . 
  half of the totally available permits are decided by lottery , held twice a year . 
  you can read a fair bit - on a site which i acknowledge is likely to give a very slanted view as it 's eu-sceptic , however i 've not seen a writeup anywhere else - here : http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=86122, 
  liechtenstein ( which is , yes , tiny ) has had restrictions on migration for the past eighteen or so years . 
  freedom of movement is not an absolute ( yes , it 's close - but deals * can * and have been done ) . 
  sure - it 's an absolute tiddler . 
  but it does show that freedom of movement is * not * absolute within the eea . 
  now , i 'll grant you that it 's a small place , but liechtenstein has had controls on migration for eighteen years now . 
  and it 's in the eea . 
  see here for discussion ( yes , it 's an eu-sceptic site , but it seems an unlikely topic for pro-eu sites to cover in detail !, 
  ) : http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=86148, 
  it ca n't be vetoed . 
  you 'd need a blocking minority at a minimum . 
   ultimately , the withdrawal agreement will be concluded on behalf of the eu by the council acting by qualified majority after obtaining the consent of the majority of the european parliament . 
  ( interestingly , uk meps do not appear to be excluded from voting on this issue . ), 
   the qualified majority system is defined as 72 per cent or more of member states representing at least 65 per cent of the populations of those voting . 
  in simple terms , this means that ireland has no unilateral right of veto on any brexit agreement . 
  i think brutalism was the ` in thing ' with architects in the late 60s/early 70s , hence the concrete boxes littering our cities . 
  personally , i do n't mind folk experimenting with different styles and such , and some modern stuff can be pretty nifty looking ... but there are places - like edinburgh 's old and new towns - where i really wish they could suck up their architectural pride and design buildings which fit in with the surrounding historic buildings . 
  take the [ scandic crown hotel ] ( http://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/record/rcahms/52337/edinburgh-80-high-street-scandic-crown-hotel/rcahms?item=763610 ) on the royal mile ( it 's actually called something else now , but that 's what it was when it was built ) . 
  replaced a building that was destroyed by fire iirc , so this is a pretty modern building - but it looks the part , and when most of the surrounding buildings are 100 + years old it fits in nicely . 
  but it gets dismissed as being ` pastiche ' . 
  edinburgh ( a [ unesco world heritage site ] ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/728 ) , no less ) is only just starting to demolish [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rnlbart.jpg ) [ wee beauty ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i2nhz3f.jpg ) in the city centre ... 
  if you want to split hairs , the name european union 's from the major-era maastricht treaty . 
  the original decision to join the eu is enacted by the european communities act 1972 . 
  parliament remains entirely able to repeal that act , should it so wish . 
  italy 's banking sector is not in a good place : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36708357, 
   short of that ( and who wants that ? ), 
  well , it would appear that might include folk like the eu 's top trade official ? 
  that 's ... open to interpretation . 
  and america of course wo n't give a a toss about the market where 9 % of its services go ( second largest overseas market , per that same article ) , right ? 
  uk is also the [ usa 's largest foreign investor ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/dinamedland/2014/08/08/the-ties-that-bind-uk-is-the-largest-foreign-investor-in-the-us-by-far/#7e95efc96985 ) , supporting around a million american jobs . 
  do you feel that being the [ usa 's largest foreign investor ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/dinamedland/2014/08/08/the-ties-that-bind-uk-is-the-largest-foreign-investor-in-the-us-by-far/#7e95efc96985 ) , supporting nearly a million american jobs , is also worthless ? 
  you 've needed good luck to be driving one of those ( as opposed to sitting in a stationary broken-down one ) since the 1970s ;-), 
   vote to revoke the european communities act ( have to remove that law before you can issue article 50 ) . 
  no , that would be the final stage of disengagement ; the european communities act 1972 is what allows eu law to override national laws/regulations . 
  as long as we 're a member , that needs to be in place . 
   lol , the uk produces nothing which interests america . 
  so little , in fact , that the usa is only the uk 's largest export destination !, 
   the top export destinations of the united kingdom are the united states ( $ 51b ) , germany ( $ 46.5 b ) , the netherlands ( $ 34.2 b ) , switzerland ( $ 33.6 b ) and france ( $ 27b ) . 
  the top import origins are germany ( $ 100b ) , china ( $ 62.7 b ) , the netherlands ( $ 50.7 b ) , the united states ( $ 44.4 b ) and france ( $ 41.5 b ) .

  that 's going to be a fun one for corbyn to fill . 
  considering that he 's now out of scottish mps to choose from ... the snp will delight in `` london labour '' , doubly so if he manages to pick an mp from the capital !, 
  funny to think that in the long run , the loonies have actually had policies that got sensibly adopted by the mainstream ( votes at 18 , and pet passports are two , iirc ) . 
  actually , looking at the round-up [ here ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/heres-where-britains-newspapers-stand-on-the-eu-referendum/ ) , it 's a fairly even split : leave | remain -- | -- daily telegraph | financial times sunday telegraph | the times daily mail | the guardian the sun | the observer sunday times | daily mirror daily express | mail on sunday morning star | the national spectator | economist, 
  express , pro remain ?!, 
  they 're the one paper who supported ukip last time - they 're the most solidly pro-leave ` newspaper ' we have !, 
   the party is backing remain , party policy is remain no - the conservative party is [ officially neutral during the campaign ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/11880864/conservative-party-to-stay-neutral-during-eu-referendum.html ) . 
  given the significantly sized wings of the party both pro and against , to commit the party to one side or the other would 've quite possibly split it . 
  definitely a known thing outside of america :  mr kearsley said : `` having the flag upside down historically was a sign of distress . 
  you might have put it up on a fort to warn those in the know - other british forces - that there was trouble from the enemy . 
  * http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7866938.stm  hanging the flag upside down is traditionally a coded sign for distress , used by the armed forces . 
  * https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/politics/183717/flag-fail-eu-accidentally-hoists-union-jack-upside-down/  flying the union jack upside-down may be regarded as a distress signal . 
  * http://www.learnenglish.de/culture/unionjack.html, 
  flying the flag upside down is an indication of being in distress , is n't it ? 
  well , of course not . 
  it came from behind !,
