  `` putting sweden 's position forward '' seems fairly clearly a reference to dealing with bodies external to the eu , given `` as a member of the eu [ sweden ] has to vote with the common position '' - obviously within the eu countries have different ideas , but if they come to an agreed common position via qmv ... 
  taking a quote or two from an eu-sceptical norwegian politician ( who was in government at the time , albeit as a member of a junior party ) , from an interview on an [ eu-sceptical site ] ( http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=84212 ) : on the `` lack of influence '' :  anne hotly disputed the claim that the norway had no influence over eu law . 
  `` it is true that we are not there when they vote '' , she said , `` but we do get to influence the position '' . 
  explaining the simple facts of international relations , she told us , `` most of the politics is done long before it [ a new law ] gets to the voting stage '' . 
  on having to implement all regulation :  she was very conscious that norway already had a veto and was able to block eu law , the so called `` right to reservation '' , but she wanted to go further . 
  she would like to see the eea agreement changed , so that eu proposals no not automatically become law . 
  and the observation that it 's not unknown for sweden to ask norway to unofficially put their position forward , because as an eu member they 're no longer able to :  already , they find that sweden , which as a member of the eu has to vote with the common position , informally asks norway to represent a different position because it no longer has a voice . 
  to nick a line from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federation  a federation differs from a devolved state , such as indonesia , the united kingdom and the kingdom of spain , because , in a devolved state , the central government can revoke the independence of the subunits ( scottish parliament , welsh national assembly , northern ireland assembly in the case of the uk ) without changing the constitution . 
  of course we do .

   greece debt crisis : no uk cash for bailout , osborne says that was on the 14th of july . 
  and what was in the news the following day ? 
  [ david cameron frustrated as uk dragged into greece bailout ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6d92bbe2-2b04-11e5-8613-e7aedbb7bdb7.html ) ( financial times )  britain has been dragged into the eurozone 's efforts to rescue greece through a brussels legal manoeuvre that has angered london and complicated david cameron 's efforts to renegotiate uk membership terms in the eu . 
  [ european commission proposes using uk contributions towards greek bailout ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/15/european-commission-proposes-using-uk-contributions-towards-greek-bailout ) ( guardian )  plan is a blow to british pm david cameron who thought he had secured a ` black and white ' opt-out from further bailouts for eurozone countries and then a day later : [ george osborne backs down on use of eu bailout fund in greece crisis ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/16/george-osborne-backs-down-eu-efsm-bailout-fund-greece-crisis ) ( guardian )  george osborne has backed down over the use of an eu bailout fund to give an emergency loan to greece . 
  but the chancellor said there would be an `` impregnable ringfence '' around the up to # 850m of british money in the fund to prevent any losses to the taxpayer in the event of any default . 
   the chancellor argued it was a major victory for britain in the eu because he had made it a `` red line '' that uk funds would not be threatened . 
  but eurosceptics will paint it as an example of brussels reneging on an agreement with the uk , as david cameron thought he had secured an opt-out from the eu-wide bailout fund being used after it was set up to help ireland and portugal in 2010 . 
   under the rescue package , ** greece will get its loan through the european financial stabilisation mechanism ( efsm ) , which borrows against the eu budget of which the uk contributes 14 % or around # 850m . 
  **  in the event of a default by greece , non-eurozone countries will not be liable for the bill because their contributions are being ringfenced . 
  if that were to happen , the cash would instead come from the profits made on holdings of greek bonds by the european central bank . 
  technically it should be a `` nickel '' , too , but meh . 
  we knew what you meant in the first place , 
  you feel the [ 25-year german cut-off ] ( https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/glossar/texte/deutsche_im_ausland.html ) is a better place to draw the line ? 
  does rather open up the question of why other countries should bother busting their balls trying to hit that 3 % target , though . 
  it 's also weird , as netflix et al are n't * broadcasters * per se - they do n't put things out on a given schedule , they simply offer a large menu of programming and it 's down to end users to choose what they want to view . 
  if the requirement is simply that their catalogue is 20 % european-produced , then fifty episodes each of `` german grass growing '' , `` portuguese paint drying '' , `` british weather '' , etc will pad it out very easily and cheaply . 
  if the requirement is that 20 % of hours viewed are european-produced , what 're they supposed to do when people watch a shitload of house of cards ? 
  start removing us-produced content ? 
   if the uk leaves the eu then that 21 % drops drastically slightly unclear from the article , does programming have to be specifically produced within the eu ? 
  all it references is ` europe ' , and the uk 's in europe ( as are norway , switzerland , ukraine etc ) whether or not it 's in the eu !, 
  yeah , that reminds me that traditionally it was a turnip that got carved here ( scotland at least ) , not a flipping pumpkin !, 
  as to trick-or-treating - you 're right in saying that going house-to-house has been a tradition here too , i should 've been clearer at referring to the phrase trick-or-treating - it used to be called ` guising ' here . 
  as to how popular it is now - well , we get tons of black and orange plastic tat in the shops to decorate our houses with these days , certainly way more than it had when i was little !, 
  so basically this is good news for someone like uwe boll , who puts out a ton of stuff that 's probably pretty cheap to licence ? 
  yes , though tbh halloween 's hugely overshadowing guy fawkes these days . 
  hardly , they 're on different days !, 
  halloween is 31st of october , while guy fawkes night is a case of * remember , remember , the fifth of november , gunpowder treason and plot . 
  i see no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot * . 
  current gov * is * one-party ( since 2015 ) - but it asked about the one elected in 2010 ... 
  thought the halloween question was a bit unfair , it does have ancient roots , but the modern thing involving trick-or-treating and orange and black tat in all the shops is very much a modern american import !, 
  so with all these increasingly hysterical predictions of doom , gloom , and devastation coming from the remain camp - were these all scenarios they were aware of to start with ? 
  and if they were , what made them think having a vote with the option for delivering a sharp kick to our own nadgers was a good idea ? 
  and who 'd have guessed that the super-camp lt gruber would be the one to end up with helga after the war !, 
  that 's not what he said . 
   johnson , seen as the de facto leader of the leave campaign , said the past 2,000 years of european history had been dominated by doomed attempts to unify the continent under a single government to recreate the `` golden age '' of the romans . 
   `` napoleon , hitler , various people tried this out , and it ends tragically . 
  the eu is an attempt to do this by different methods , '' he said . 
   `` but fundamentally , what is lacking is the eternal problem , which is that there is no underlying loyalty to the idea of europe . 
  there is no single authority that anybody respects or understands . 
  that is causing this massive democratic void . '', 
  interesting that there 's no particularly obvious north/south divide on this ( given that you 'd expect winter to be more significant the further north you get ) . 
  consider also things like the film u-571 , where brave us submariners board a german u-boat to steal an enigma machine . 
  which was based on true events , with the * slight * detail that the actual capturing of an enigma machine was done by the crew of hms bulldog . 
  months before the usa actually joined the war . 
  no , as a general concept , it 'd streamline things if the eu had a single language ; that language could be esperanto if you liked , or french , or anything else - but to have everything in one language , removing the need for so much translation , and so much potential for cockups when a translation does n't have * quite * the same meaning . . 
  in practice though , yes - english would probably be the most `` likely '' language , and so that almost certainly wo n't happen . 
  good news then , [ there are 12 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fawlty_towers ) !, 
  ca n't see france ever agreeing to that though , and pretty sure they 'd have a veto . 
  i mean , we still decamp the european parliament to strasbourg every so often because france likes it there no matter how silly it seems to have a travelling circus ... 
  not books , those are classic bbc tv comedies . 
  we 'll just have to ask you nicely to familiarise yourself more with the classics !, 
  fawlty towers , red dwarf , blackadder ... , 
  while it would streamline things a lot for the eu to have one official language , realistically i ca n't see any government wanting to go back to its people and say `` yeah , we gave up on our language , sorry about that but the other language was more popular '' . 
  i suppose it 's understandable to want to learn the ` local ' version of the language . 
  i mean , say quebec had someone managed to take over all of north america , and quebec french had become extremely widely spoken ; we 'd still regard french-french as the `` real '' one i think . 
  well , there 's that famous joke on euro-english , is n't there ? 
    the european commission has announced an agreement whereby english will be the official language of the eu , rather than german , which was the other contender . 
  her majesty 's government conceded that english spelling had room for improvement and has therefore accepted a five-year phasing in of `` euro-english '' . 
   in the first year , `` s '' will replace the soft `` c '' . 
  sertainly , this will make sivil servants jump for joy . 
  the hard `` c '' will be dropped in favour of the `` k '' , which should klear up some konfusion and allow one key less on keyboards . 
   there will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year , when the troublesome `` ph '' will be replaced with `` f '' , making words like `` fotograf '' 20 % shorter . 
   in the third year , publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible . 
  governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling . 
  also , al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent `` e '' is disgrasful . 
   by the fourth yer , peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing `` th '' with `` z '' and `` w '' with `` v '' . 
   during ze fifz yer , ze unesesary `` o '' kan be dropd from vords kontaining `` ou '' and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters . 
  after zis fifz yer , ve vil hav a reli sensibl riten styl . 
  zer vil be no mor trubls or difikultis and everivun vil find it ezi to understand ech ozer . 
  so basically . . guilty of not being russian enough ? 
   the uk has gone from loads of phone providers to a handful in the space of a few years no we have n't ; in terms of actual networks we 've got vodafone , o2 ( originally bt 's mobile arm !, 
  ) , three , and ee ; the only real consolidation is that ee is a merger of the old orange and t-mobile networks . 
  five down to four is not really `` loads '' to `` a handful '' . 
  there have been , and still are , loads of virtual network operators who piggyback on one of the actual networks . 
  not unknown within the uk too : http://www.edinburghfreewifi.com/, 
  yep , there was a [ cartoon strip done of that ] ( http://i.imgur.com/helsfxi.jpg )  ( might be a kinda duplicate comment , i originally linked this image from buzzfeed , and got a message from automod saying the post had been removed . . though i can still see it ! ), 
  `` in europe , a hundred miles is a long way ; in america , a hundred years is a long time '' . 
  oh , of course - why does * any * nation engage in multinational groupings if not to better itself ? 
  oh , i would n't take his attitude as the standard either - i just think we need to be realistic , the eu is neither devil nor angel , it 's simply a group of 27 other countries who are largely there out of self interest rather than glorious unity principle too . 
  perhaps a painful reminder that the neither the eurosceptic vision of the eu as a raging monster , nor the europhile vision of the eu as a benevolent friend , is entirely accurate . 
  pretty sure average broadband speeds are solidly better now than ten years ago !, 
  it 's very sad that my first thought there was to wonder what the hell the relevance of my little pony voters was , is n't it ? 
  technically , the sun still does n't set on what 's left of the british empire . 
  och , go on then . 
  it 's not really all * that * much different ( other than appearing in a nifty shade of purple ) - still a little behind the 2004 point in people and economy , albeit more member countries : http://i.imgur.com/nbftcsv.png, 
  as neither scenario currently seems likely , i 'll pass i think !, 
  does n't really make a ton of difference , does it ? 
  whichever figure we use , the economy square comes out as `` slightly smaller than the 2004 one '' . 
  i got a 2015 gdp figure of $ 2.858 tn from http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/gdp and roughly converted that to around $ 2.6 tn via http://www.x-rates.com/average/?from=usd&amp;to=eur&amp;amount=2858&amp;year=2015, 
  for the sake of comparison , here 's an [ extended version with the effect of brexit added in ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sv5ma2r.png ) .
