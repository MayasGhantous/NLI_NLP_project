  you get even longer in the uk , normally 7am-10pm . 
  mm , still not convinced . 
  his final total , after transfers , was 5,394 in count 8 in 2016 ; this time , on count 6 , he had 6,373.16 . 
  almost 1000 votes up on last time . 
  actually , the main reason he lost out this time is because there were only five seats up for grabs in foyle , and he was the sixth candidate elected last time ; had there been six seats this time he 'd have gotten in again . 
  looking at eamonn mccann in particular , he squeaked in last election on the final count , and was edged out on the final count of this election - he got 4,176 ( 10.5 % ) first preference votes in 2016 and 4,760 ( 10.7 % ) this time , so i do n't think you could really say that his electoral appeal was significantly damaged by a pro-brexit stance . 
  given ni 's history , i think the poc was set up more with a view to ensuring that neither community ( and perhaps particularly the unionists ) could force something through without cross-community consent . 
  obviously it 's impossible to predict the future , but i do n't think anyone at the time would 've imagined the dup and sinn fein would end up having the sort of lock on ni politics that they have today , either . 
  on what grounds would , or could , you appeal ? 
  [ the law ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/47/section/42 ) is fairly straightforward ;  if 30 members petition the assembly expressing their concern about a matter which is to be voted on by the assembly , the vote on that matter shall require cross-community support . 
  the intent 's clear that it should n't be possible to force anything through against the wishes of either community , and when one party represents a strong majority ( ie 30 + members ) of that community - they do get a de facto veto . 
  that hurdle has effectively just been raised , though , since you now need 30 out of 90 mlas rather than 30 out of 108 . 
  worth noting that [ back when the assembly was first set up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_ireland_assembly_election,_1998 ) , no party was over the 30 seat mark on its own , and by far the two largest parties were the more moderate uup on the unionist side , and the sdlp on the nationalist side . 
  of course , on the flip side , sinn fein ( as the largest republican party ) also have an effective veto over the whole thing - by withdrawing their cooperation they can bring the whole assembly down , as they did to cause this election . 
  aye - while some folk on both sides get very wound up about the uk being in or out of the eu , it 's * never * rated particularly highly on the list of things that people give when considering which way they 'll vote - it 's always the more `` obvious '' things like health , education , the economy , etc. 
  i wondered the same thing - however [ according to ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/5xa3mt/northern_ireland_election_results_megathread/deh7brc/ ) / u/bridgeboy95 ( who afaik lives there ) :  never jim hates the petition of concern and he is the tuv in stormont . 
  he is literally the only tuv guy getting in and he loathes the poc, 
  the petition of concern is laid down in the law that founded the assembly - while the dup 's usage of it is unlikely to be what was envisaged , it 's entirely legal . 
  to explain the petition of concern : it means that if thirty mlas ( a number that is laid down in the assembly 's founding legislation , rather than being a specific fraction of the total ) put one forward - on pretty much * anything * - then that issue requires a majority amongst both nationalist ( sinn fein , sdlp ) * and * unionist ( dup , uup , tuv ) designations . 
  given that the dup have well over half the total unionist mlas , that gave them an effective veto over everything ( including , for example , a vote of no confidence in one of their ministers ) . 
  whereas english is just sadistic , where you could have something like a rough bough through the window , and the - ough part sounds different in all three words !, 
  ( roughly , - uff , - ow , - oo ) . 
   saada ( `` send '' ) , saada ( `` to become/to get '' ) . 
  ah , a * proper * language like english , where just because two words are spelt the same it 's no guarantee they * sound * the same . 
  in this case , the reciprocal deal would be `` eu citizens already in the uk can stay here indefinitely , in exchange for uk citizens already in the eu being able to stay there indefinitely '' ; given the difference in numbers ( ~ 900k brits in eu , ~ 3m eu citizens in uk ) it would hardly have been an unfair deal to the eu , and could have been presented as both sides putting their citizens above political squabbles . 
  interesting , i think that 's the first time i can remember seeing a poll which was n't for european elections , where the euro-party gets a mention alongside the national one . 
  depends on what share of eu assets we get ( if we 're expected to contribute based on future commitments , presumably we should also get to benefit from past commitments too ? 
  iirc indications are that * most * eu nations would 've been happy to agree a reciprocal deal , but a couple - including germany - were opposed , and thus it 's stuck waiting till after the a50 notification . 
  in fairness to france , they actually have an operational carrier * with * air wing at the moment ... 
   there is no magic solution that the eu is simply denying us -- fish need to reproduce and we need to monitor their levels and how much we fish them and it seems sensible that this is done at a continental level as fish do n't follow schengen rules . 
  sure - yet norway and iceland , both outside the common fisheries policy ( and thus not obliged to give everyone else equal access to their waters ) seem to have managed to both retain a substantive domestic fishing industry * and * not overfish their waters to the point of collapse ? 
  you 'd have thought russia would get the grey-with-an-annotation like belarus and moldova , if they were n't included in the same survey ? 
  nothing odd about being proud of that , that 's one truly epic pizza . 
  it [ did n't go to waste either ] ( http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2016/5/italian-chefs-create-mile-long-neapolitan-to-break-longest-pizza-record-429657 ) :  once lucia had confirmed the new record , visitors were able to take away a slice of the delicious neapolitan . 
  any remaining pizza was then taken to camper onlus association , italian red cross and to chicchi di grano association to be redistributed to those in need . 
  but if you start scoffing before it 's cooked , you 'd shorten the record-breaking length !, 
  i mean , i 'm assuming that the length of the pizza is considered after it 's cooked , rather than before ? 
  now i look , there was more than one oven though . 
   the pizza was running from the us consulate ( repubblica square ) to castel dell ` ovo along the picturesque bay of the caracciolo 's seafront . 
  250 proud masters of traditional neapolitan pizza had gathered from all over the world and as far as australia , asia and japan for the record attempt . 
  2,000 kg of flour , 1,600 kg of tomatoes , 2,000 of ` fiordilatte ' cheese , 200 litres of olive oil , from strictly local suppliers , was the recipe for success . 
  ** 5 wood fired portable ovens , each constructed on 4 wheels , had been specially created for the event . 
  ** each oven , controlled by about 25 people , had four openings , two to allow the pizza to enter in an out and the other two for the wood supply . 
  the pizza was resting on a long , single , flexible , perforated , steel , 50 cm ( 1 ft 7.68 in ) wide baking tray to allow cooking to great standards . 
  it had been prepared strictly in line with the guidelines of the pizza tsg , acronyms for ` traditional speciality guaranteed ' officially recognised on 5 february 2010 by the european union . 
  so `` just '' 370m of pizza to cook per-oven ... 
  though it feels that by the time the oven got to the far end of the pizza , the beginning would be stone cold ... 
  seems weird that a eurobarometer 's included russia but not norway , switzerland , etc ? 
   it is interesting how much less they provide in winter in general given the number of daylight hours europe gets in summer , compared to winter , it 's not really all that surprising is it ? 
  that 's pretty much what i meant , though it did at least seem likelier than adding afd to that mix , 
  so if i make the numbers from the article out right , that 's : party | percentage -- | -- spd | 31 cdu/csu | 30 linke | 10 green | 7 afd | 12 fdp | 6 assuming that the other four percent is effectively wasted on parties too small to gain representation , that seems horribly finely balanced . 
  i mean , spd+l inke + green would yield 48 % , leaving 48 % in opposition . 
  if you could get the fdp on board as well you 'd have a comfortable lead , but my suspicion is that 's probably a bit of a reach to reconcile the fdp with die linke ? 
  or is that more likely to lead to a spd+cdu / csu grand coalition again , with the spd taking the chancellorship ? 
  the point is that this is about as newsworthy as farage saying `` eu bad '' . 
  it 's * always * his answer . 
  looks possible . 
  http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/eufa  eufa european football association ( obsolete , now uefa ), 
  verhofstadt 's answer to something is `` more europe '' ? 
  well , there 's a first . 
  * cough *, 
  the ` largest ' bit seems a little arguable , too ;  in the castle category , prague castle claims to be world 's largest . 
  however , despite the singular name , prague castle is not a single building . 
  like the forbidden city , it comprises a number of palaces , temples , and halls ( constructed over several centuries ) that share a common defensive wall . 
  altogether , the complex covers 18 acres , leading to the self-appointed title of `` largest coherent castle complex in the world . '', 
  for all the nitpicking though , it 's a stunning ( set of ) building ( s ) . 
  something to put on the `` to be visited '' list !, 
  imagine if it 'd looked [ something like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yysomrg.png ) ... ( yeah , i know , that 's a us passport - i was lazy and took the first gis result for `` hot pink passport '' ), 
  any colour you like 's an option , though the number of countries brave enough to embrace hot pink or lime green is indeed sadly low ... 
  the netherlands were n't fucked pre-schengen , were they ? 
   she never ran for office yes she did . 
  she ran to be elected as mp , just the same as david cameron did . 
  when a vacancy arose in her party 's leadership , she stood for that too . 
  true , it 's a mystery why other countries have n't minted coins worth 105 % of their major currency unit . . :-), 
  if you think that sounds fun ... pre-decimalisation ( 1971 ) , the british pound subdivided into 20 shillings , each of which divided into 12 pence . 
  and pre-1960 , each penny subdivided into four farthings . 
  found [ the third round ] ( https://twitter.com/europarlpress/status/821419403459915776 ) : candidate | votes | change -- | -- | -- antonio tajani | 291 | +4 gianni pittella | 199 | -1 helga stevens | 58 | -8 jean lambert | 53 | +2 eleonora forenza | 45 | +3 laurentiu rebega | 44 | -1, 
  missed the third round as i was travelling home , but here 's the fourth round :  the result of the fourth ballot is the following :  voting : 713  blank or void : 80  votes cast : 633 candidate | votes -- | -- antonio tajani : | 351 gianni pittella : | 282  antonio tajani has obtained the majority of the votes cast and is therefore elected president . 
  as a point of entertainment , you could 've gotten this result a lot quicker by using fptp on the first round 's votes ... edit : [ here , have a pretty bar chart of all four rounds ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mjttyqd.png ) . 
  i 'm not going to argue that views stay the same , as they patently do n't ; the consensus of the 1960s is long gone . 
  but look at the two referenda we 've had . 
  the 1975 referendum was a strong yes to europe across more or less all age bands according to [ what little i can find ] ( https://sagevals.wordpress.com/2016/04/17/lobby-the-grandkids/ ) . 
  the 2016 referendum saw a strong leave vote from an age group who voted predominantly in in 1975 . 
  and so again - as people have aged , they have shifted to a more conservative viewpoint . 
  net contribution - [ here 's a simple visualisation in the form of a chart ] ( https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjwhbfdfxiu/irsif3bk0o1w/v1/-1x-1.png ) ( taken from [ this article ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-12/seven-brexit-strategies-theresa-may-could-use-to-erode-eu-unity ) ) . 
  the eu is about to lose what is , by far , its second largest contributor . 
  so what happens ? 
  will germany , france , the netherlands and italy up their contributions by , what , 50 % ? 
  will countries that are currently net beneficiaries find that they become net contributors ? 
  will the eu cut its budg ... okay , that one was n't serious . 
  will taxes raise for everyone to make up for the loss ? 
  i do n't know , but the eu is certainly going to notice the loss of uk money there . 
  going forward - i do n't think it 's unreasonable to say that the uk 's relationship with the eu has not been working particularly well for quite a long time now , do you not think it better that we try for an amicable separation rather than do all we can to drag the other party down because fuck them how dare they think differently to us ? 
  as may said :  `` we will continue to be reliable partners , willing allies and close friends . 
  we want to buy your goods , sell you ours , trade with you as freely as possible , and work with one another to make sure we are all safer , more secure and more prosperous through continued friendship . '', 
  i 'm not sure you get the point i was making . 
  the uk will disengage from the eu . 
  the uk and eu can negotiate terms along friendly cooperative lines ( we both win ) , or destructive lines ( we both lose ) . 
  you say the uk 's going to have to raise a tax or two - so will the eu !, 
  the uk 's net contribution to the eu is more than every eu member bar germany put together ... * everyone * is going to have to adapt to new circumstances .
