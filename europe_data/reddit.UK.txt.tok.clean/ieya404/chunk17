  would you rather we do that to as much mutual benefit as we can manage , or would you prefer that we try to kick seven shades of shit out of each other ? 
   those elderly who lived through ww2 you mean like the folk who were elderly in 1964 or 1979 , who ... favoured the conservatives ? 
  yes , politics changes over time . 
  but as people age they consistently identify more with the current `` right wing '' position , do n't they ? 
  look at the article i linked - in each of the years plotted ( 1964 , 1979 , 1987 , 1997 , and 2010 ) there 's a strong correlation between age and supporting the conservatives . 
  parties change , people change , and views get more conservative with age . 
  no , theresa may was elected as an mp the same as any other prime minister is . 
  the uk does not directly elect its prime ministers , and roughly half of pms in modern times have assumed the office during the course of a parliament ( callaghan , major , brown , may since the 1970s ) . 
  * why * do you feel the eu should engage in self-harm - is it not better to see the uk and eu * both * do better , rather than damage the eu just so you can damage the uk too ? 
  [ second round results ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/infos-details.html?id=10202&amp;type=flash ) ( and i 've added the change in a third column ) :  the result of the second ballot is the following :  voting : 725  blank or void : 34  votes cast : 691 candidate | votes | change -- | -- | -- antonio tajani | 287 | +13 gianni pittella | 200 | +17 helga stevens | 66 | -11 jean lambert | 51 | -5 lauren\u021biu rebega | 45 | -5 eleonora forenza | 42 | -1, 
  i hope both sides engage positively with a view to creating a deal that benefits both - it 's certainly possible . 
  for context , see eg [ this infographic ] ( https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2014/3/20/1395326815809/budget-2013-the-governmen-010.jpg ) ; in 2013 it raised # 41bn out of a total of # 648bn raised by the government . 
  and today 's middle-aged folks will be the grey vote then , and [ very likely have shifted their opinions too ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-young-old-politics ) . 
  aka `` alde , plzzzzzz vote for me , lots of love , gianni ... '', 
  mm , epp have 216 seats , so that 's another 60-ish meps that 've supported him from outside his group - whereas s&d have 189 and their candidate fell six short of that total . 
  [ first round results  ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/infos-details.html?id=10202&amp;type=flash )  the result of the first ballot is the following :  voting : 718  blank or void : 35  votes cast : 683 candidate | votes -- | -- antonio tajani | 274 gianni pittella | 183 helga stevens | 77 jean lambert | 56 eleonora forenza | 50 lauren\u021biu rebega | 43  no candidate has obtained an absolute majority of the votes cast . 
  therefore , a second ballot will be organised . 
  the second ballot will take place at 13.00 . 
  links, 
  it 's written in the treaties , and you need unanimity to change those , so yes - france has a veto . 
  changing treaties is not something that 's done lightly these days , for fear of having to pass referenda ... 
  interesting , does the - ska bit go silent in normal usage ? 
  yeah , complete failure of a quick skim there , saw the h and hungary sprang to mind , completely forgetting the . . is it something like hrvatska ? 
  that . hr actually represents which is n't hungary at all !, 
  ha , good point !, 
  i admit i simply guessed by the domain name ... 
  as stupid as it is , if i was in france 's position , i would n't give it up without being bought off either . 
  what 's in it for them ? 
  ( particularly , consider the domestic effect on popularity of a french president who signs away a regular trainload of free cash to the strasbourg area ) . 
  ( iirc , it 's in the treaties too , so it 'll be a right pain to undo - you need every other eu nation to ratify treaty change . . ), 
  they 've been successfully pissing money up that particular wall since it was founded ... it 's evidently something people will put up with !, 
  of all the things that might make it fall apart , the stupidity of wasting some money shuffling the parliament to and fro regularly probably is n't one of them i think . 
  other than the prestige , the parliament going to strasbourg regularly means a lot of money being spent in france that otherwise would n't be . 
  what 's in it for france to give that up ? 
  oh sure , ruin some hungarian chap 's hard work why do n't they ... http://www.kiboke-studio.hr/i-dont-care-about-cookies/ ( which before this kicks in , is a handy addon that shuts up the bloody cookie warnings on many sites ), 
  they were ridiculously good pilots ; http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/the-polish-pilots-who-flew-in-the-battle-of-britain, 
  looks like ( based on comment by uri granta [ here ] ( https://www.quora.com/how-accurate-is-the-assertion-and-map-that-britain-has-invaded-all-but-22-countries-in-the-world ) ) that map 's included poland on the basis of the deployment of british troops there during the [ british military mission to poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_military_mission_to_poland ) . 
  at the end of the day we do n't know what the book 's authors ' criteria were - i just do n't think it 's unreasonable to use a definition of ` european country ' that means countries which are primarily located in europe ? 
  sure - but it 's still fair to say that russia is n't a european country in the same way that germany is - it 's eurasian . 
  worth noting that the imf considered the pound to be overvalued pre-referendum : https://fullfact.org/economy/exchange-rates-and-imf/ as did plenty other analysts : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/currency/12065157/pound-is-most-overvalued-currency-in-the-world-analysts-claim.html, 
  probably a case of only considering countries that 're entirely within europe as european - something like three quarters of russia 's landmass is in asia ( though , yes , something like three quarters of the population is in the european bit !, 
  `` europe '' is annoyingly often used as shorthand for the eu , yes . 
  which gives us nonsense like discussing the recent referendum as a vote to leave europe , which obviously it is n't , since the uk is n't very mobile . 
  interesting that this poll 's numbers are quite different to other polling i 've seen for the uk , which on the whole does not find ` bregret ' is a significant thing . 
  see eg this recent article , suggesting both that a re-run of the referendum would again yield a narrow leave result , and that a solid majority do not want a second referendum : http://uk.businessinsider.com/comres-brexit-poll-people-would-vote-leave-2016-12, 
  so just looking at article 7 :  1 . 
  on a reasoned proposal by one third of the member states , by the european parliament or by the european commission , the council , acting by a majority of four fifths of its members after obtaining the consent of the european parliament , may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a member state of the values referred to in article 2 . 
  before making such a determination , the council shall hear the member state in question and may address recommendations to it , acting in accordance with the same procedure . 
  the council shall regularly verify that the grounds on which such a determination was made continue to apply . 
  the european council , acting by unanimity on a proposal by one third of the member states or by the european commission and after obtaining the consent of the european parliament , may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the values referred to in article 2 after inviting the member state in question to submit its observations . 
  where a determination under paragraph 2 has been made , the council , acting by a qualified majority , may decide to suspend certain of the rights deriving from the application of the treaties to the member state in question , including the voting rights of the representative of the government of that member state in the council . 
  in doing so , the council shall take into account the possible consequences of such a suspension on the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons . 
   the obligations of the member state in question under the treaties shall in any case continue to be binding on that state . 
  the council , acting by a qualified majority , may decide subsequently to vary or revoke measures taken under paragraph 3 in response to changes in the situation which led to their being imposed . 
  the voting arrangements applying to the european parliament , the european council and the council for the purposes of this article are laid down in article 354of the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  so what the parliament can do is make a reasoned proposal to the council , which then needs a 4/5 majority to determine there 's a * risk * of a serious breach ( para 1 ) . 
  however para 2 appears to be required to determine the * existence * of a breach , and that seems to require a proposal by 1/3 of member states or by the european commission , followed by the ep 's consent - but the ep does n't appear to be able to initiate that one ? 
  i imagine it 'd destroy most * walls * in the vicinity ... 
  wales wanted out too ... 
  odd that he talks about the schengen zone purely as an aspect of the eu , when it has non-eu members too ( eg norway ) . 
   either 2 or 3 in the uk ( depending on if northern ireland is a separate country so which one out of england , scotland , and wales are you not counting as a country ? 
  dangerous ground ... :-), 
  yeah , but just try finding a dakimakura with her on , 
  just in case the process was n't looking potentially chaotic enough !, 
  culturally , linguistically , historically , it 's very separate though . 
  note the sad lack of waifus in classical european art , for example . 
  you do n't think  any european country may apply for membership is a fairly clear impediment ? 
  no mention of eurasia there , just european ... gon na have to keep importing those waifus for a while yet , 
   if anything it would make more sense for portugal or even the uk to switch to +1 . 
  not really - timezones are based off the greenwich meridian which goes through london , and it makes more sense to have your timezone such that midday ( 12 noon ) actually is the middle of the day !, 
  multiple timezones are evidently no barrier to success ( the usa manages with five different timezones ) - why do n't we all just pick the timezone that actually makes sense for where our country sits on the globe ? 
  annoyingly incomplete story . 
  it suggests that wilders ' party will hit 36 seats ; they have 12 right now , so that 's +24 . 
  then rutte 's liberals go from 40 to 23 ( -17 ) , and pvda go from 35 to 10 ( -25 ) . 
  so there are eighteen seats going somewhere that is n't any of those three parties ... where ? 
  that 's a fair chunk of seats and could presumably make alternative coalitions that do n't include wilders viable ? 
  santa claus looks to be a corruption of the dutch [ sinterklaas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinterklaas ) , which refers to a character based on saint nicholas . 
  additionally , those two are probably not perfect comparisons given the relative sizes and populations of the countries ; better comparisons would be other larger european countries like france , germany , italy . 
  roughly a 2/3 : 1/3 split in favour of the right eye : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ocular_dominance, 
  iirc the dominant eye is usually the right too , so again , driving on the left ( with the dominant eye closer to the road 's centreline ) makes sense !, 
  understood , it just does n't make much sense to average them together , as they 're different systems controlled by different politicians with different agendas . 
  you might as well average the whole eu . 
  annoying that they use a single colour for all of the uk , when there are separate education systems with significant differences ( in format and in attainment ) between them . 
  italy did no such thing in the same way as the referendum was nothing to do with sticking it to matteo renzi . 
  in * theory * it was n't ; in practice , it was . 
  aye - point being that if greece does n't want to leave the euro , there 's absolutely no mechanism to force it , is there ? 
  am i right in thinking there is n't even a thinly sketched mechanism ( cf : article 50 to leave the eu ) for a country to leave the euro ? 
   zero-sum exchanges with foreign companies where their customers can operate for free on our networks and we can operate for free on theirs . 
  i guess the problem there is that those may be very unequal exchanges ; imagine an exchange between danish and german networks . 
  80 million germans are likely to be able to use a hell of a lot more capacity on denmark 's networks , than 5 million danes will use on germany 's networks . 
  i 'm sure i remember a dodge that was being used by some company , whereby data was unlimited , but throttled by default to ~ 2g speeds - with a free boost in the home market to useful speeds , and a payable boost when roaming ... wonder what happened to that . 
  the companies wo n't be paying for it forever , though ; the price they charge you needs to be enough to cover their own costs at an absolute minimum . 
  if users on holiday use enough roaming data to cost the companies $ 10/user/month on average , you can bet that everyone 's prices will go up by $ 10 a month whether they roam or not . 
  someone should mention this to nicola sturgeon , her party 's struggling along at a mere 45 % or so in the polls and her own approval 's still positive ... 
  respectable , but i 'd not count either as a daily newspaper , which is what the above list is . 
  well , tabloid sized . 
  yeah , it 's a cheap paper , i suppose i 'd think of it as a more new oriented thing that 's pretty anodyne for the most part like the metro . 
  yeah , it 's kinda scary when you look at it ...

  i remember being blown away by a chap on britain 's got talent who was from romania originally , [ razy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z62zrqaqvby ) , only reason i might not feel safe around him would be the risk of crossfire from agents  but then he 's the `` best '' sort of immigrant to any country - someone who goes there and engages with the local culture ( if i can call pop tv programmes as culture ) .
