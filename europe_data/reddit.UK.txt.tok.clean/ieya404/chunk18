  hmm , bild 's [ print run 's around 2.5 million ] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/304799/bild-circulation/ ) for a population of 80 million ( so ~ 3.1 % of the population 's worth ) , the mail 's about 1.5 million for a population of 64 million ( ~ 2.3 % of the population ) , so yes , bild 's a bit bigger . 
  then again , you can add another 430k or so for the daily express , which gets you into very similar territory ... and then we have the red-top rags .

  aye , i think it 's an easy/lazy geographic distinction , where ` eastern ' is shorter to say than ` ex-warsaw pact ' ; you could perhaps think of it as east or west of the old iron curtain . 
  but we do n't mean to be twats , promise . 
  more about the rate and scale of change happening in people 's towns , which they felt they had no control over , i suspect . 
  when they 've been used to everyone speaking english all around them , and suddenly there 's shiny new polski skleps and suchlike and it 's new and strange and change is weird and to be feared ... 
   the only people who are talking about indyref2 are the unionists please tell me what the snp 's `` national survey '' is about , then ? 
  for background : [ snp aim to reach 2 million scots in ` national survey ' on independence ] ( https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/9223/snp-aim-reach-2-million-scots-national-survey-independence ) . 
  gaelic was just one of many languages once spoken in scotland , much as there were other languages spoken across the rest of great britain which have also fallen by the wayside . 
  as times have moved on and communication has become easier across greater distances , is it any wonder that we 've standardised on a common language ? 
  as-is , we 'll lose a european election every so many years . 
  with independence ( and assumed application to join the eu ) we 'd lose a westminster election every so many years . 
  there 's not really much in it on the elections front at least !, 
   but if the uk intends to stay in the single market , its position as contracting party to the european economic area agreement will have to be renegotiated . 
  why ? 
  the uk is a signatory to the eea agreement , and there does n't appear to be any provision in the eea agreement to eject a country . 
  apple \u2122 , windows \u2122 , sky \u2122 ... are you sure about that ? 
  ... any particular reason ? 
  here 's a link to their article : http://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/eu-parlament-tuerkei-111.html google translate of that :  the european parliament has , by a large majority , called for a freezing of the accession negotiations with turkey . 
  the member states and the eu commission are not bound by this , but the call has a high symbolic power - but president erdogan does not attach any importance to it . 
   by a large majority , the european parliament voted to stop eu accession talks with turkey . 
  of 623 parliamentarians , 479 voted in strasbourg not to speak any further with the ankara government about open negotiating chapters and not to open any new chapters . 
   the resolution is not binding on the eu commission and eu member states , but it is a symbolic force . 
  parliament thus responded to the turkish leadership 's actions against state officials , media and opposition parties after the coup attempt in july . 
   more than 36,000 people have been detained . 
  more than 75,000 civil servants and members of the security forces were dismissed , thousands more were suspended . 
  the turkish government accuses them of the movement of the preacher , fethullah g\u00fclen , who is responsible for the coup attempt . 
   temporary requirement  it was important for europolitikern that it was a temporary requirement . 
  they want to review their position as soon as turkey has lifted the state of emergency . 
  decisive is the extent to which turkey has returned to the rule of law and respect for human rights . 
   the meps also called for a reintroduction of the death penalty to automatically lead to a formal suspension of the accession negotiations . 
  turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly brought the reintroduction of the death penalty into play . 
   erdogan was the vote in the european parliament so far seemingly untouched . 
  on wednesday he announced that the vote for ankara have no value . 
  in this case it is n't - the [ abortion act 1967 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abortion_act_1967 ) covers england , wales , and scotland ( in particular , it simply [ excludes northern ireland ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/87/section/7 ) ) . 
  what an annoying article - it would be incredibly useful to know * why * croatia has n't ratified this !, 
  if you 'd quoted a little more of the wikipedia article :  wensleydale cheese was first made by french cistercian monks from the roquefort region , who had settled in wensleydale . 
  they built a monastery at fors , but some years later the monks moved to jervaulx in lower wensleydale . 
  they brought with them a recipe for making cheese from sheep 's milk . 
  [ 4 ] during the 14th century cows ' milk began to be used instead , and the character of the cheese began to change . 
  a little ewes ' milk was still mixed in since it gave a more open texture , and allowed the development of the blue mould . 
  at that time , wensleydale was almost always blue with the white variety almost unknown . 
  nowadays , the opposite is true , with blue wensleydale rarely seen . 
  when the monastery was dissolved in 1540 the local farmers continued making the cheese right up until the second world war , during which most milk in the country was used for the making of `` government cheddar '' . 
  so the original sheep 's milk-based recipe came from the french monks . 
  but it was developed into the non-blue , cow 's - milk based wensleydale cheese that 's known today , in england . 
  assuming the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland#politics ) is right , yep , the lower house is d'hondt with a 5 % national threshold . 
  and then the senate is 100 members elected via fptp . 
  no , it is n't . 
  as i already pointed out , peru 's inca kola sells better in peru . 
  see for example http://journalperu.com/inca-kola-the-curious-peruvian-cola/ or here 's a [ google cache of a 2014 financial times article ] ( https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:tp1mfx-sw_uj:https://www.ft.com/content/9a71091a-1eef-11e4-9d7d-00144feabdc0%3fmhq5j%3de4+&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk&amp;client=firefox-b ) . 
   inca kola is , experts point out , among a few privileged beverages more popular at home than coca-cola . 
  others include irn-bru , the best-selling fizzy drink in scotland . 
  there 's also india 's '' [ thums up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thums_up ) ''  as of february 2012 , thums up is the leader in the cola segment in india , commanding approximately 42 % market share and an overall 15 % market share in the indian aerated waters market . 
  irn bru may ( or may not ) be top dog in scotland ; there 's a 2003 article in the scotsman , for example : http://www.scotsman.com/news/coke-takes-sparkle-from-irn-bru-1-666491  according to new figures , the united states giant coca-cola is winning the battle for scotland 's 525 million soft drinks market , knocking the domestic champion , irn-bru , off the number one spot in the struggle for supremacy . 
   scotland was long one of the few countries in which a domestic brand outsold the iconic us product . 
  but according to the independent industry ratings experts ac nielsen , standard coca-cola now leads the way in `` impulse '' buying - which includes purchases from outlets such as convenience stores , petrol stations and off licences - across the country with sales of 23.4 million . 
   and over the year to 16 august , diet coke was number one in the `` grocery '' sector - sales from supermarkets - with 24.4 million worth sold . 
  but then that was _ 14 _ years ago , and it 's not easy to find up to date sales figures . 
  iirc coca-cola 's top dog in virtually every country on the planet , apart from peru ( inca kola ) and scotland * may * still have irn bru on top ( iirc last time i looked around it 'd been very close and was difficult to find any up to date figures ) . 
  [ could we be the bad guys ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opz8ekk3ewy ) ? 
   unique arrangement it is n't ; there 's also the [ kingdom of the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_the_netherlands ) . 
   the four parts of the kingdom -- the netherlands , aruba , cura\u00e7ao , and sint maarten -- are constituent countries ( * landen * in dutch ) and participate on a basis of equality as partners in the kingdom . 
  and ` great britain ' misses out northern ireland , one of the uk 's four constituent pieces . 
  if you 're alluding to things like the battle of waterloo , just taking wikipedia 's sidebar numbers for troop strengths :  total : 118,000  anglo-allies : 68,000  * united kingdom : 25,000 british and 6,000 king 's german legion  * netherlands : 17,000  * hanover : 11,000  * brunswick : 6,000  * nassau : 3,000 [ 4 ]  * 156 guns [ 5 ]  prussians : 50,000 [ 6 ] so less than a quarter of the forces that fought napoleon 's armies were actual british troops . 
  well . . fine ? 
  to make a change which is not easily reversible , you * should * need to demonstrate strong support , rather than just 50 % +1 of whatever turnout you happen to get on the day . 
  there 's no reason for scotland to want tariffs with ruk , no . 
  but if you assume a less than perfect brexit , then you have the potential for tariffs between the uk and the eu . 
  if scotland were then to leave the uk and join the eu 's single market , it would be obliged to put up those same tariffs between itself and ruk ( else it 'd circumvent the whole thing ) . 
   i 'm pretty sure a main reason for scots to want to remain is access to the single european market . 
  thing is , the uk single market is worth roughly four times as much to scotland ; if it comes down to a choice between the two there 's only one economically sensible choice . 
   economically , it would n't have changed much . 
  mm , it would 've made scotland much more vulnerable to shifts in the price of oil ( and by follow-on , the likely tax revenue that can be raised from it ) - in good years we 'd be rolling in it , but right now , it would 've put fairly serious hurt on the country 's finances . 
  needs the st patrick cross added , mind you . 
  but it is fun to see . 
  i do n't think the polling * was * that bad this time - but may led a truly crap campaign , while corbyn made a good fist of his . 
  i think votes genuinely did shift . 
  had the voting in the election gone along the same lines as polling was at the time she called the election , she 'd have won a huge majority - and likely given herself a lot more flexibility to negotiate as she would n't be nearly as beholden to the relatively small number of hard eurosceptics in her party . 
   to make it a one-time 50 % +1 threshold was foolish . 
  but no different to any other uk referendum which has had ( potentially ) difficult to reverse consequences ; the hurdle for scottish independence was similarly a single one-off 50 % +1 requirement . 
   there 's a strong chance that that decision would not be made again if another referendum were called i do n't think there 's been much sign of that in opinion polling - and at present it appears a large majority want to see brexit carried out , eg https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/03/29/attitudes-brexit-everything-we-know-so-far/, 
  it 's coverage from during a general election , each seat counts its own votes and they take different amounts of time to do so ( how large the seat is , how many votes have to be counted , whether it 's close and they have to do a recount , etc ) . 
  so the things flashing up are announcements that the conservatives have held constituencies ( ie , won a place where they won last time too ) . 
  worth noting that they are the scottish national party , not the scottish nationalist party - while i am no fan of theirs , they 're not even slightly similar to the nsdap . 
  . . except that they have a healthy majority on their own in england ( 55 % of all seats ) . 
  just two more votes than his nearest opponent . 
    the snp 's stephen gethins won 13,743 votes compared with janet riches of the scottish liberal democrats who polled 13,741 . 
  presumably a cdu/fdp coalition would be more secure than the raw number of 101/200 looks , since the afd have a chunk of votes which are highly unlikely to align with the various parties of the left too ? 
   scotland in the eu would need to join the euro and schengen scotland would need to commit in principle to joining the euro ; it could still intentionally fail to qualify to join ( and in anycase would certainly fail initially , lacking an independent currency with several years in the erm ii ) . 
  schengen i would expect to see the eu offer flexibility over , given the precedent with uk and ireland . 
  if memory serves , the only remaining outright exception is denmark - however the way it 's structured , it 's possible for a country to deliberately fail to qualify for the euro ( by not participating in erm ii ) , thus giving an effective opt-out to any non-euro members . 
  to change that , i believe you 'd need treaty change , which is understandably not an option most countries want to play with ( given the pain in getting it ratified in all countries , necessitating referenda in some , etc ) . 
  i think it 's difficult to see a win-lose deal in either direction ; why would the ` lose ' want to sign such a deal ? 
  win-win , or lose-lose , or meh-meh are all possible , tho . 
  yoinking from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe ) ( which has linked sources if you fancy further reading ) :  the number of stars on the flag is fixed at 12 , and is not related to the number of member states of the eu ( although the eu did have 12 member states from 1986 to 1994 ) . 
  this is because it originally was the flag of the council of europe . 
  [ 15 ] in 1953 , the council of europe had 15 members ; it was proposed that the future flag should have one star for each member , and would not change based on future members . 
  west germany objected to this as one of the members was the disputed area of saarland , and to have its own star would imply sovereignty for the region .
