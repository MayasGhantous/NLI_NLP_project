  so let 's just say that it 's a 50km distance which costs the same per km as the 12km \u00d8resund , so a mere ( 50/12 * us$ 5.7 bn = us$ 23.75 bn , which scales to $ 31-38bn in today 's money . 
  call it us$ 34bn . 
  that 's still 15 % of finland and estonia 's combined gdp . 
  for that matter you could probably argue it 's the baltics and the nordics - but it 's finland and estonia that would get the bulk of the benefit by more-or-less bringing their two capitals together . 
  in fairness , they 're benefiting from a rather shorter crossing there !, 
  the [ \u00d8resund bridge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%98resund_bridge ) is more or less 8km of bridge + 4km of tunnel ( costing about 30.1 billion dkk , ~ us$ 5.7 bn in 2000 's money ) - compared to the 50km of tunnel needed for helsinki-tallinn . 
  as a very , very rough ballpark , let 's say that 8km of bridge costs the same as 1km of tunnel and that costs can be multiplied up , so the new link would be roughly ten times the cost ; ~ us$ 57bn in 2000 's money , or roughly us$ 74-93bn in today 's money using the [ tool here ] ( http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/relativevalue.php ) to estimate current value . 
  call it us$ 83bn . 
  [ finland ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fi.html ) 's entire gdp in 2013 was around us$ 195bn , [ estonia ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/en.html ) 's around us$ 30bn . 
  so the tunnel is going to cost a bit over a third of the two countries ' combined gdp . 
  ( compare with [ denmark in 2000 ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/denmark/gdp ) with a gdp around us$ 160bn , [ sweden ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/sweden/gdp ) around us$ 247bn , making \u00d8resund cost around 1.4 % of their combined gdp ) i 'm going to say this is probably pushing it a bit for finland and estonia to afford alone !, 
  as far as i understood there 's an existing ferry service for cars , so it 's not like folk are having to drive through russia to get between the two capitals at the moment ? 
   one could more easily travel the capitals helsinki - ( tallinn-riga-warsaw ) - berlin with a train instead of flying from helsinki to berlin looks like it 'd be very roughly 1600km from helsinki to berlin , assuming you managed a sustained 160km/h that 's a ten hour trip . 
  direct flight 's more like 1100km , roughly two hours in the air ( so there and back in a day is feasible ) . 
  can see the argument for making helsinki-tallinn function more like one city with a particularly large lake in the middle , but not really convinced it hugely opens up berlin from there . 
  interesting question , given the obvious precedent of the channel tunnel which i believe was actually ( largely ? ), 
  privately funded . 
  the flipside being that uk-france is linking two significantly larger economies than finland-estonia , who would presumably struggle to fund it on their own ? 
  interesting , have n't seen a surface myself yet . 
  there 's hope , then !, 
  logically i think it has to be , because the same lightning -  usb cable will plug the phone into your computer and let it charge as well as letting the computer talk to the phone . 
  the annoying bit of course is that the ideal would be to use something like apple 's magsafe connector , in practice i 'm sure that 's locked up behind enough patents to make it impossible . 
  they 're already on the case , as reported in eg [ this story in the inquirer ] ( http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2319855/eu-pushes-for-a-single-laptop-charger-standard ) last december . 
   the ` ndrangheta family prince would be sent away to sicily until he turned 18 . 
  the rehabilitation does not take place in the area they normally live in . 
  they 're taken out of that environment . 
  wonder how long before someone tries a ` right to family life ' human rights claim on this ... 
  they eat a lot more into the tories ' vote , though . 
  this should be higher rated - even if you go back to 1707 with the acts of union which created the kingdom of great britain ( unifying the largest island into a single kingdom ) , that 's never been successfully invaded . 
  while the norman invasion of 1066 was certainly impressive , it did n't take scotland . 
  more accurately , withdrawn when iceland threatened to revoke permission for the nato air base at keflavik ; the air base was more important than fishing rights to the uk . 
  as refugees , they 'd probably make a better impression if they claimed asylum in the first safe country they landed in ( ie cyprus ) rather than demanding to be taken on to italy . 
   although 65 left the ship when it docked at limassol , the rest reportedly insisted on being taken to italy . 
  oh , i 'm sure it 'll be revolutionary , until the inevitable factional splits . 
  there was the ssp in scotland , too , until they had a vicious falling-out with founder tommy sheridan ( ex-militant tendency ) , resulting in neither faction doing at all well ... 
  left unity , or before them tusc , or militant tendency , or however many hard-left groupings in the uk , are all rather remarkable by their lack of electoral breakthrough and long-term effects ... 
  yep , the scottish electorate 's been sophisticated enough to start voting quite differently between uk and scottish general elections ; labour still romp home for uk ones . 
  if anything it 's a negative correlation - yes 's best result was the labour bastion of glasgow , while snp strongholds like eilean siar went no . 
  just link 'em to https://twitter.com/yesdundee/status/512750627626049536  to clarify , ballot papers have not yet been sorted into yes/no and are just resting on table where no will go once sorted . 
  no need to worry . 
  assuming it 's true , they should be getting angry at their politicians for setting up such a daft system . 
  it 's hardly the refugee 's fault . 
  if that 's what they do when they 're runners up , i ca n't imagine what the response would be if they 'd won ... 
   only one labour and one tory mp expressing scepticism or opposition . 
   the blairite domination of the labour party from 1994-2007 perverted labour from a social democratic/socialist party into a fully signed up neoliberal capitalist party . 
  i imagine that might come as news to the likes of jeremy corbyn , dennis skinner , diane abbot , et al in the [ campaign group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_campaign_group ) ... though does n't explain their relative silence either . 
  however , it 's difficult to even nominally commit to joining the euro when you lack a central bank , which is something of a pre-requisite . 
  i do n't think i 'd try relying on the bank of england for that purpose either ... 
  fun bit of random trivia for scotland - while celtic have won the most times , and rangers are naturally second , the third most wins is queen 's park . 
  to give some idea of how much rangers and celtic have sewn up scottish football in general , queen 's park 's last win was in 1893 ... 
  i 'm actually quite surprised/impressed that their electoral alliance is holding - i 'd have expected the smaller more centrist parties to be open to temptation from the left . 
  curious , in the constituency view of that map , it shows one of the cornish seats as being split between the tories and lib dems . 
  wonder wtf they were thinking there ... it 's 3 each in cornwall for the two parties . 
  salmond 's intended date for scottish independence is in 2016 ; earliest likely date for a uk referendum is 2017 . 
  uk will still be in the eu at the point scotland wants in ( though in fairness is also incredibly unlikely to oppose that ) . 
   so just by switching to android nokia would have become the biggest phone manufacturer in the world ? 
  become ? 
  nokia ** were ** the biggest phone manufacturer in the world , they just missed the boat when the world moved on to smartphones . 
   let 's also see how firefox os and sailfish turn out ... my money 's on `` too little , too late '' i 'm afraid . 
   after reading initial political analysis it seems the british government is not pleased out of curiosity where 've you been reading ? 
  [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29139503 ) :  the uk will oversee financial services in the new 28-strong european commission - a surprise move that delighted the uk 's pm david cameron . 
  [ guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/european-commission-tory-peer-economic-post ) :  chancellor george osborne said the announcement was great news for britain . 
  `` look forward to working with lord hill , eu financial services commissioner , to build safer & more competitive sector . 
  great news for uk , '' he tweeted . 
  [ telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11086631/lord-hill-wins-financial-services-post-in-new-european-commission.html ) :  `` i think that is a great piece of news because 40 per cent of europe 's financial services industry is in the united kingdom , a lot of it here in scotland , '' said mr cameron while campaigning in edinburgh against scottish independence . 
   `` i think it would be great for the united kingdom to have someone right at the heart of the european commission , the european union , making sure that financial services industries can go from strength to strength . '', 
  i 'm not seeing indications of displeasure ? 
   government has succesfull it projects . 
  trust me , as a brit it 's amazing to see government , successful , and it put together too . 
   the defense minister said that germany remained nato 's `` second-largest net spender , ''  the us , comfortably nato 's largest military power , spends 4.4 percent of its gdp on defense , the uk spends 2.4 percent . 
  greece and estonia were the only other members of the 28-country alliance to clear the 2-percent target in 2013 . 
  figures on the map show the usa at 3.8 % / us - $ 618.7 billion , uk at 2.3 % / us - $ 56.2 billion , france at 2.2 % / us - $ 62.3 billion , and germany at 1.4 % / us - $ 49.2 billion . 
  so how does she claim germany to be the second-largest net spender , when there are three nations spending more , and how does the article claim only usa/uk/greece / estonia are hitting the 2 % target when france is spending 2.2 % ? 
  the cornwall/wales pairing does n't look entirely historically unrealistic ... see eg http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/anglo-saxon_heptarchy.jpg/640px-anglo-saxon_heptarchy.jpg splitting scotland vertically is `` interesting '' though . 
  `` ruk would defend iscotland '' - and now we 're making assumptions about military alliances . 
  much like nato . 
  seriously , it 's a daft argument ; iceland 's arrangements have been shown to be absolutely adequate for the last six decades and some . 
  it 's a perfectly viable country . 
  if the threat is a russian invasion , then most countries would n't count as ` viable ' ; if you gave scotland 10 % of the uk 's armed forces ( but no nukes ) , would you really rate our chances against a determined russian attack ? 
  me neither !, 
  iceland 's nato membership has answered their military needs since 1949 . 
  i 'd call it viable . 
  it 's a member of nato , and joined with the agreement that it would not be expected to raise its own armed forces . 
  it does n't * need * to be self-sufficient in its own defence as it 's part of a defence pact . 
  which is , as i 'm sure you know , why the uk backed down in the cod wars - because it was not worth risking nato 's air base at keflavik over . 
  it won the last ' [ wars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cod_wars ) ' it was involved in , and is a nato member . 
  what military problems do you see iceland facing ? 
  take a look at the actual referendum literature , particularly the government one , available here : http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/1975ref.php  no important new policy can be decided in brussels or anywhere else without the consent of a british minister answerable to a british government and british parliament . 
  or indeed the text on civitas 's page :  our last chance to vote on our membership of the eu was in 1975 . 
  ** among the arguments used then was our ability to veto any proposed reform . 
  that safeguard was decisive in persuading many doubters to go in . 
  ** this is how the government put it at the time , in a leaflet circulated to all voters :  `` the minister representing britain can veto any proposal for a new law or a new tax if he considers it to be against british interests . '', 
   `` remember : all the other countries in the market enjoy , like us , democratically elected governments answerable to their own parliaments and their own voters . 
  they do not want to weaken their parliaments any more than we would . '', 
   it is very revealing to compare the eu we know today with the institution portrayed in the 1975 government leaflet . 
  what we have now is not what was voted on in 1975 , nor was it predicted or implied . 
  point is that at the time , the question was framed in terms of staying in the `` common market '' , which was perceived as a very different beast to what the eu now is . 
  there 's also the point that anyone under the age of 50 or so has never had a vote on it . 
  i do n't think it would be a bad idea at all to have a referendum , get it over with , and put the running sore of uk-eu politics to rest one way or the other . 
  in what ways is iceland non-viable ?
