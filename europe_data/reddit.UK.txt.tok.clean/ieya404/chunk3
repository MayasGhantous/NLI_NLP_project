  it 's a self-governing un member . 
  your implication was that edinburgh , or shetland/orkney , were n't viable countries . 
  if iceland ( not to mention tiddlers like monaco , san marino , and liechtenstein ) are viable , it 's hard to see why edinburgh or the northern isles would n't be . 
  iceland 's population is less than that of edinburgh , and it 's still a viable country ... 
  would n't have said so . 
  have a look over http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/which%3f note in particular  legal powers  ** super-complaints ** the consumers ' association has the power under the enterprise act of 2002 to take action on behalf of consumers , including the ability to bring a super-complaint to the office of fair trading ( oft ) . 
  [ 23 ] which ? 
  is one of eight organisations able to issue a super-complaint . 
  the consumers ' association was among the first groups granted these new powers . 
  a super-complaint can be made about any market that is not working properly for consumers . 
  as consumers are not in the position to overcome the issue themselves , which ? 
  can issue a super-complaint on consumers ' behalf . 
  the oft has 90 days in which to assess the complaint and decide what to do about it . 
  it can reject the complaint in part or as a whole , it can launch a market investigation , take action under competition law or consumer law , or refer the market to the competition commission for further investigation . 
   which ? 
  made its first super complaint about private dentistry in 2001 . 
  [ 24 ] it later made complaints about care homes , the northern ireland banking sector and credit card interest calculation methods . 
  in march 2011 it made a super complaint [ 25 ] about unfair debit and credit card payment surcharges made by retailers . 
  the oft upheld the super-complaint in june 2011 . 
  [ 26 ]  ** legal action against rogue traders ** in 2005 which ? 
  was granted legal powers to bring rogue traders to account for their actions under part 8 of the enterprise act 2002 . 
   ** unfair contract terms ** which ? 
  has statutory powers under the unfair terms in consumer contracts regulations 1999 . 
  which ? 
  can seek an injunction to restrain the use of an unfair contract term by a trader against consumers . 
   ** competition appeals tribunal ** which ? 
  is one of the ` specified bodies ' who , under the enterprise and competition acts , may bring proceedings before the competition appeals tribunal ( cat ) on behalf of two or more consumers for damages . 
  which ? 
  was granted specified body status on october 1 , 2005 by the ministers of the department of trade and industry . 
  in april 2007 which ? 
  launched its first representative action on behalf of consumers unlawfully overcharged for football shirts due to price fixing . 
  governments would n't have repeatedly given it legal powers if it was n't a useful consumer rights group . 
  airwatts are definitely a start , but do n't seem to factor in the effect that different bristles/rotors may have on picking up crud from the carpet either . 
   which ? , on the other hand , says that of seven cleaners awarded `` best buy '' status since january 2013 , five have motors of more than 1,600 w. 
  wattage is a painfully crude measure ; if you spent three times as long using a vacuum with half the wattage because it did n't suck up as well , you 'd wind up using more power overall . 
  would 've been more useful to get consumer groups like which ? 
  from across the eu together , independently come up with standards , and start restricting vacuums that have poor amount-sucked-up-per-power-used . 
  if a high power vacuum can clean things up in a fraction of the time , that 's no bad thing ... 
  i defer to your superior - and local !, 
  - knowledge , 
  looks like auto was part of works at the time ;  in 1924 , \u0160koda works acquired the laurin-klement car manufacturer , later known as \u0160koda auto . 
  both companies became separated after 1945 , when the entire czechoslovak economy came under government control . 
   yes , i know that all countries except uk are supposed to eventually adopt euro denmark has the same exemption . 
  aye - i seem to recall reading that one of hitler 's reasons for invading was to get his hands on the skoda works ... 
  one of the four main vw brands , i think i saw them nominally summarised once as : audi : upmarket , sporty vw : upmarket , sensible seat : downmarket , sporty skoda : downmarket , sensible under the skin all four of course share a lot of chassis and mechanicals ... 
  we 're into the realms of impossible guessing games ; who 's to say that gordon brown 's replacement would n't have been an irish mp ? 
  similar to scotland - if they elected a similar preponderance of labour mps that 'd have comfortably balanced things between labour and the tories last time ... 
  obviously it 's all very speculative , but if you assumed a `` happy union '' where you had the same parties operating across the whole ` atlantic isles ' , that probably would shift the balance of power somewhat - though it 's extremely hard to realistically guess what the party breakdown would be , i 'd hazard a guess that it might not be entirely dissimilar to scotland , which might 've left labour and the tories with similar numbers of mps - and the lib dems in a real `` kingmaker '' position . 
  do n't think anyone would advocate recreating a union now , mind you - i think wutdahelliot was more speculating on what-if 1922 had gone differently and somehow all sides had stayed happy with the uk of gb & i. 
  you do n't think that ireland 's mps in that scenario would change the balance of power ? 
  that was a really interesting read , thanks for linking it !, 
   considering that the uk is seriously considering ditching the deterrence if scotland goes it 's own way i know it 'd be a real pain to relocate the trident subs from faslane , but i 've not seen any serious discussion suggesting that the uk would disarm if scotland separated . 
  so , um , when did robin hood relocate to glasgow ? 
  quite surprised to see how high the ownership percentage is in the nordics , i 'd always had the illusion that there was a lot more renting there than the uk . 
  british / scottish / anglophone . 
  you could work with as many currencies as you liked - obviously the eu used to have one currency per country . 
  thing is , while it might be * possible * to have a `` north euro '' and a `` south euro '' , that 's simply not what the politicians want - the political will was for a single euro currency , and come hell or high water that 's what will happen . 
  absolute worst case ( and honestly i think we 're past the point where it might 've happened anyway ) you might 've seen one or two countries withdraw from the euro and revert to their own currencies . 
  a generous offer , but apparently we 're ok there :  consular assistance  there is an honorary british consul in andorra , under the supervision of the british consulate - general , barcelona . 
   to contact our honorary consul in andorra or to request consular assistance in andorra , you should first make contact with the british consulate general in barcelona . 
   british consulate-general edifico torre de barcelona avenida diagonal 477 - 13 08036 barcelona  tel : 902\u00a0109\u00a0356 ( if calling from within spain ) tel : ( +34 ) 91\u00a0334\u00a02194 ( international/alternative number )  info.consulate@fco.gov.uk, 
  `` the technique has already been used with success in england '' good luck then . 
  the uk 's where the wrong * kind * of leaves on the line are a famous excuse for trains not running . 
  fair point - those of us in the larger countries like the uk and france obviously have the benefit of a huge network of embassies already . 
  hull 's always going to be a branch off the east coast main line i think ( else you end up having to bridge the humber again , which is needless extra expense ) . 
  would certainly agree that the purple line north from london should probably be the ecml though , taking in newcastle and edinburgh , and missing glasgow to head on up to aberdeen . 
  the red west-coast line should similarly either skip edinburgh entirely , or at least hit glasgow first . 
    being a single entity for international institutions     the only reason you ever go to your national embassy is for a copy of a birth certificate or some other document . 
  for everything else , you go to the eu embassy , which handed everything . 
  i suspect sambri had things like un membership in mind , where the eu is not a member , but the uk , germany , france etc all are . 
  mind you , if i was abroad and needed help , it 'd sure as heck be the uk embassy that i approached . 
   jersey , for example , is not a full member of the eu i 'd struggle to describe it as anything of a member , really ; it just has access to the common market . 
   jersey has a special relationship with the european union ( eu ) . 
  in simple terms , the island is treated as part of the european community for the purposes of free trade in goods , but otherwise is not a part of the eu .

  `` stroke city '' is the ` safe ' version , i think ? 
  it is ... if you 're driving a truck . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/piratenpartij/ is the dutch one which appears to be official ; http://www.reddit.com/r/piratepartyofcanada/ the canadian one ; there are also pages for [ germany ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/piratenpartei/ ) , [ the uk ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/piratepartyuk/ ) , [ australia ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pirateparty_au/ ) , and [ the us ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/uspirateparty/ ) which appear to be unofficial . 
  i almost wonder if he was being `` funny '' - anybody behind a bar in the uk should be able to serve a pint of bitter no problem !, 
  after all we 've spent on it , quite sad to see edinburgh 's trams missed off this !, 
  pics at eg http://www.photography-scotland.com/2013/12/daytime-tests-for-edinburgh-trams/, 
  fairly sure it 's the one with the extra antenna stuff on the roof , using this google maps view to help : http://goo.gl/maps/ab7f0, 
  iirc the uk designs all use sea water for cooling , which makes a coastal location pretty favourable ... 
  telegraph 's the paper that broke the whole mps ' expenses story - they 're good . 
  over the bbc , really ? 
  for a uk perspective ? 
  the uk would be likelier to consider transferring gibraltar to spain , if the gibraltarians actually wanted it . 
  given that spain seems to do everything in its power to piss them off , it 's no surprise how crushingly one-sided the opinion polling is against the idea . 
  aye , the simplest explanation i 've seen for the bnp 's position is that it 's like old labour , but with racism . 
  might as well hurry it up and then we can find out what each country 's second choice candidate is ... 
  while it 's mildly impressive to be in the lead , it 's also fairly meaningless , since as soon as you go to the run-off she 'll get hammered , just as her father did in 2002 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_presidential_election,_2002, 
  the simple reason is that it 's written into the treaties that the ep will decamp to strasbourg regularly , this is worth a fat wodge of euros to france , and so france has no interest in seeing a rationalisation where they stay in brussels the whole time . 
  there 's not really much more to it , and being honest , who * would n't * stick to a perk that gave them lots of money ? 
  i 'm kinda amazed that these things still count as ` news ' . 
   why was n't jesus born in norway ? 
  - they could n't find 3 wise men . 
  heh , i 've seen that one as why he was n't born in essex - as they could n't find three wise men and a virgin . 
  see , i could understand that if it was someone like madeline mccann , who feels like she 's barely been out of the news since disappearing - but i honestly do n't recall this one at all , and six years later ? 
  sometimes google 's algorithms really are bizarre . 
  the uk 's girl , for example , is a [ 17-year-old briton who was murdered in brazil in 2008 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/2481259/british-girls-mutilated-body-found-in-suitcase-in-brazil.html ) .
