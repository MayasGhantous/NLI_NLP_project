  wtf makes that rank so highly ? 
  and the uk 's indicated that it would like to see much stronger sanctions put in place and accepts these will have an economic hit on the uk : http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/07/21/uk-ukraine-crisis-sanctions-britain-idukkbn0fq0ju20140721, 
  other eu countries are n't in the process of upgrading russia 's ability to wage war , though . 
  an ability that russia has not exactly been demonstrating responsibility with of late . 
   kick russia out of being a permanent member of the un security council ca n't see how you could possibly achieve that . 
  eurocountry : `` we propose that russia be removed from the security council '' russia : `` we veto that '' eurocountry : `` oh cock '', 
  seems a bizarrely perverse decision - it does n't seem as though the blog author did anything to specifically promote that article , so it 's hardly her fault if google consider it a particularly appropriate result when searching for the restaurant 's name . 
  looking also at tripadvisor , it seems to have had pretty mixed reviews over time : http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/restaurant_review-g776256-d3188457-reviews-il_giardino-lege_cap_ferret_gironde_aquitaine.html on google plus they 've basically had it , looks like they 've been deluged with one-star ratings since the recent court case : https://plus.google.com/104942878229251996791/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en the owners are idiots for having taken this to court - they 'll earn far more negative publicity than they could ever hope to offset by having a blog article suppressed . 
   the mayor ( and the dj ) are going to get a bill from sabam , the belgian copyright agency for playing copyrighted music ; that actually seems odd - one would 've thought the dj would have a licence from sabam to be able to conduct his business in the first place ? 
  given that i was explicitly referring to the ease of how the larger neighbouring country can bugger things up by closing the border , do you really think the history is actually relevant ? 
  does it somehow change the annoyance and irritation caused to the smaller territory ? 
  nothing like a reminder of how similar to gibraltar 's situation it is , is there ? 
  ( in terms of the neighbouring country 's ease in shutting down the border ), 
   he singled out jacques delors , francois mitterand , and helmut kohl - the commission president , french , and german leaders , respectively - who presided over a dynamic integrationist period in eu history - for praise . 
  it should be `` interesting '' to see how much love he gets from the british press , then ... recalling a [ certain classic sun front page ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/149/437565574_eef58513c7.jpg ) !, 
  uk actually would n't be the correct term , as the olympics team includes gb and ni , the isle of man , the channel islands and uk overseas territories which do not have their own national olympic committee . 
  as far as i know this is a fair idea of what shakespeare-era english sounded like : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gplppht7n9s, 
  i 'd had the impression/understanding that ashton had ended up being considered pretty decent in the post , which would seem to imply that experience is n't essential ( if , i think , still certainly desirable ) . 
  could be i have the wrong impression , of course !, 
   but there is growing opposition within the european parliament , which must confirm her nomination , particularly within its centre-right bloc , which believes ms mogherini -- who has only been italian foreign minister since february -- lacks experience and stature . 
  and lady ashton had ` experience and stature ' when she was appointed ? 
  there may be many valid reasons to criticise a candidate , but i 'm not convinced those two are the strongest . 
  the sashes certainly exist : http://www.mauquoy-shop.com/en/producten/echarpes/autres/echarpe_parlement_europ_en-18-108-866 - a mere ~ $ 140ish too !, 
  so if they ca n't find other work , they get 60 % salary for a year , then 45 % for another year , and then 30 % for a third year . 
  that 's a pretty epic package for folk who could 've been doing this for a mere three years ? 
  take a look at the google map for its location : https://goo.gl/maps/kpt4u in short , it 's in the arse end of nowhere . 
  an extremely pretty and scenic nowhere , to be sure , but it 's remote and you can bet that broadband is n't going to be impressive . 
  and that 's why it 's ( relatively ) cheap . 
   afaik the portuguese population of oliven\u00e7a fled so that if there was a referendum now it would mostly be the spanish voting and obviously they would want to stay . 
  would spain really want to legitimise the idea of a local referendum being allowed to determine which country a town was associated with ? 
  somehow , i think not ... 
  hey , it 's ** ice ** land , the name 's a clue that it 's freezing . 
  well , since you suggest germany , let 's look at some election posters . 
  http://news.yahoo.com/photos/woman-walks-dog-past-election-poster-german-chancellor-photo-113734463.html do you see epp or cdu branding on that poster ? 
  http://www.neurope.eu/article/schulz-promise-change-commission-president how about that one - with schultz , one of the spitzenkandidaten no less . 
  pes or spd ? 
  see what i mean ? 
  the european parties do n't exist ` on the ground ' - national parties do , even in `` well-informed '' countries . 
  obviously i do n't know the mind of every individual citizen , and there will be a few out there who actually do want to vote for a particular european party , and vote for their local affiliated party - but if you look at the way the votes went in each country , it 's very obvious that as a whole , people voted on national lines . 
  try right-clicking the link and choosing ` open in new private window ' ( or whatever comparable thing your browser offers ) . 
  worked for me at least . 
  so when you said that `` the eu makes up almost 50 % of all uk exports '' , you actually meant `` the eu makes up about 40 % of all uk exports '' , with another 20 % of uk exports shipped through rotterdam ? 
  there 's a difference between taking a measured consideration of a proposed candidate and voting yes or no based on their suitability , and pre-emptively saying you 'll vote no to anyone who is n't a former prime minister of a tax haven with an alleged alcohol problem ... 
  a choice where the ep will shoot down any candidate that is n't the one candidate * they * have picked is no choice at all . 
   no , the council is supposed to take note of ep election results , it 's fully within the ep right to reject any nominee it does n't like . 
  when the ep indicates that it `` wo n't like '' any nominee apart from the single choice they 've made , how is that not a power grab ? 
  the council is functionally left with no choice . 
  the full poll is here : http://www.aecr.eu/media/aecramr-european-election-poll.pdf  awareness of political parties at the european level is very low -- less than 9 % were able to recall one of the european level political parties . 
  44 % of respondents replied instead incorrectly with the name of a ** national ** political party . 
  awareness of any european party is slightly higher amongst actual voters , with 11.8 % being able to name one unprompted . 
  19.9 % of voters were able to name at least one of the candidates , given that the aided awareness of juncker was only 33.9 % amongst voters it does seem likely that although probably more than 8 % , it 's probably still probably rather less than a quarter . 
  we might have european parties , but nobody votes for them . 
  people vote for their national parties , which in most cases do n't even mention their membership of a european party during the elections . 
  while the proportion of actual voters who 'd heard of juncker is rather higher , it 's a very accurate point about national elections . 
  there simply is n't a european electorate , nowhere do people vote on a european level for european parties - we vote on national levels for national parties , which happen to be in sometimes rather artificial or awkward pan-european groupings to get all that lovely free eurocash . 
  no , but the labour party and liberal democrats have * also * opposed juncker 's appointment . 
  the majority did vote for one of those three parties . 
  in theory the council are supposed to `` take note '' of the ep , this has turned into `` do what the ep demands because the ep will refuse to confirm anyone who is n't the one person they nominated '' . 
  i do n't think the suggestion by / u/masterofwhisperers that this is a ( successful ) power grab is too far from the mark . 
  looking at the [ full poll ] ( http://www.aecr.eu/media/aecramr-european-election-poll.pdf ) , 19.9 % of * voters * were able to name at least one of the spitzenkandidaten . 
  schultz looks to have been a better known candidate ( there 's a chart showing prompted awareness , which has him known of by 39.6 % of voters while juncker 's at 33.9 % ) , so while juncker might well have been known of by more than 10 % of voters , it 's probably not a lot more . 
  i 'd also suggest that even where people have heard his name , they 're highly unlikely to know much beyond that . 
  there simply is n't a european electorate - there are a whole bunch of national electorates which vote along national lines . 
  some of us are scots , ya bampot , 
  well , what iso country codes do they use ? 
  united kingdom : gbr jersey : jey bermuda : bmu they may not be fully independent countries , but they are n't part of the uk either . 
  see eg https://www.royal.gov.uk/monarchuk/queenandcrowndependencies/channelislands.aspx  situated 10 to 30 miles off the north-west coast of france , the channel islands are not part of the united kingdom . 
   they are dependent territories of the english crown , as successor to the dukes of normandy . 
  i take it you do n't credit mexicans with much intelligence , if you think they signed up to be ripped off ? 
  and assuming you 're referring to the european coal and steel community , that started with more than just france and ( west ) germany - belgium , italy , the netherlands and luxembourg were also involved . 
  not even remotely capita equals ... 
  why have efta and nafta not evolved along the same lines , then ? 
  ( though i grant that efta 's members , by being in the eea , are affected by much eu regulation ) . 
  how d'you mean , except the epp ? 
  considering it appears to have eight or so member parties in italy alone ... 
  just sounds like they 've done a bit of research and have made arrangements to play the system as well as they can . 
  aye , i 'd identify as british/scottish similarly . 
  i think he 's just pointing out that we do n't really vote as ` europeans ' , we vote as ` nationalities ' . 
  even if we ignored all the national party names and just considered each country 's votes as for `` epp '' `` s&d '' `` alde '' `` ecr '' etc , the votes are very different from country to country . 
  there simply is n't any unified european political culture . 
  apparently ( from a comment in an [ lse blog ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2014/06/09/media-coverage-in-germany-and-the-uk-shows-why-both-countries-have-radically-different-views-over-who-should-be-the-next-commission-president/ ) )  labour also told schulz not to campaign in britain as they thought it might damage them at the european elections so it 's possibly a vicious circle at work of a ( requested ) low profile leading to little reporting ? 
  no idea about whether the lib dems wanted verhofstadt to say anything or not here , admittedly . 
  i suppose he could safely take it as read that efd would n't have much to tell him that he wanted to hear anyway !, 
  i 'd hope you 'd accept that 's a speculative view too - as we 've not done this before it 's all in the realms of possibility . 
  i suspect the truth lies somewhere between the `` nae problems , easy sailing , milk and honey for all '' and `` eternal gloom and damnation , isolated in the world without a friend '' extremes . 
  what i think most likely is that scotland * would * need to apply to join the eu as a ` new ' state , that said i 'd also expect fairly smooth sailing through the application process as scotland already meets most eu criteria . 
  i doubt that it would get to inherit all of the uk 's `` special cases '' ( eg euro opt-out , rebate , zero vat rates ) . 
  overall will in scotland in terms of its elected politicians is certainly heavily in favour of eu membership . 
  and it 's a super way to demonstrate democracy by ignoring the shifts in votes and divvying things up between the big two groups as always ... 
   all groups , except for the british conservative-dominated ecr said eu leaders should nominate juncker or the ep will veto any other candidate . 
  really ? 
  efd said juncker should get the nod too ? 
  so there is ... seems to be an extreme minority appeal though . 
  who 's in favour of * independence * for northern ireland ? 
  you 've got the various unionists who are very very in favour of staying as part of the uk . 
  you 've got nationalists who 'd like to unify it with the republic of ireland so that the whole island is one country . 
  who wants it to be independent ? 
  from what i can make out , the vast majority of campaigning on the continent is done by national parties too , with the europarty name very much in the background if mentioned at all . 
  i do n't see what you 're trying to get at . 
  if the conservative party had still been within the epp , it still would n't have mentioned that and still would n't have mentioned juncker ( based on the fact that no other uk party did so either ) .
