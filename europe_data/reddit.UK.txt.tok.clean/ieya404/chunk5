   i 'm not sure what you mean by this . 
  what i said was that the ecr refused to post a candidate for the presidency . 
  so if you did n't have a chance to vote for one , that was n't europe 's fault ; it was cameron 's fault . 
  how is it cameron 's fault what the other british parties did ? 
  none of the british parties made a big point about their european affiliations or the spitzenkandidaten ... and from what i can make out that 's pretty common across europe . 
  staying within the epp would 've been fundamentally dishonest , given the epp 's commitment to a federal europe . 
  as it is , it looks as though the ecr will be the third largest grouping in the new european parliament , and i do n't think liberal parties have been criticised in the past for their membership of the third largest grouping ... and yes - people cast their votes for their national parties ; that does not necessarily mean they were also endorsing those candidates ' spitzenkandidaten . 
  when you look at the number of people who watched the debate between them ( derisory ) , and the number who could name a single one ( less than one in ten ) , it 's a joke to claim a democratic mandate . 
  he took his party out of the epp and refused to propose a candidate for the ecr . 
  what , it 's cameron 's fault that the spitzenkandidaten simply did n't feature in the euro elections at all ? 
  it 's not as though he has control over labour , the lib dems , the greens etc , is it ? 
  people simply were not casting their votes based on the spitzenkandidaten . 
  curious given that you have two alde members in denmark , were they just advocating voting for either of the two ? 
  ah , never saw shenkey 's post at the time , so that 's one country that did make them clear ; however it does sound like your country and mine do n't make the europarty link obvious , and from what countvontroll said in that other thread neither did germany . 
  i find it unlikely in the extreme that even a sizeable minority of voters realised that their vote was explicitly endorsing juncker , schulz , or anyone else . 
  as i 'm sure you know , no , though his party does . 
  as a serious question , do you recall what was on your ballot papers ? 
  i know the ones in the uk purely show national parties and their logos - things like epp , pes etc do n't appear at all . 
  are the europarties used anywhere in europe on the ballot papers ? 
  this is true , but the man described as the `` architect of the constitution '' probably has a pretty good perspective . 
  that 's funny , i do n't remember seeing juncker on my ballot paper . 
  being serious - once you factor in * the number of people who even know which euro-party the party they actually voted for is affiliated to ( look at election posters , literature , etc , and how rarely designations like epp or pes appear compared to national party names/logos ) * the number of people who were aware that voting for a party was implicitly supporting a particular candidate * the number of people who had any idea who the candidates were yes , the epp is the largest grouping , but to claim that juncker specifically has a mandate is a nonsense . 
   and before someone claims this , no - they were n't exactly the same . 
  according to valery giscard d'estaing , the treaty was the same as the constitution , just designed to dodge referenda . 
  england does n't divide terribly conveniently into bite-sized chunks , though ; the euro-regions are sort of sensible sizes population wise , but people simply do n't identify with them on the whole . 
  they will identify with england as a whole , or their county ( eg yorkshire , or cornwall ) - but those divisions tend to be too large or too small ... 
  i think most folk in the uk could identify the main three parties here of labour , the lying lib dems , and the fucking tories . . , 
  as i 'm sure you 're well aware , it was a mighty , throbbing , pulsating 36.1 % of the turnout who voted for the tories , knowing that was an endorsement of david cameron as pm . 
   what percentage of the eu turnout do you honestly believe voted for juncker to be ec president ? 
  while i think we both have to appreciate that the `` i do n't give a toss about any of this '' option is the one that really won , * of the people that voted * the vast majority of voters simply have no idea of european-level parties ( less than 9 % could name a single one ) . 
  trying to pretend that the 2014 european election results constitute a mandate for juncker is a fantasy . 
  please explain what 's so glorious and democratic about appointing someone whose allied parties pulled in slightly over a quarter of the vote across europe ( and of course 12.3 % of the eu population could n't have voted for him even if they wanted to ) , when most of those voters did n't even know they were `` voting for him '' ? 
  do voters take - any - account of the european grouping , though , or do they vote for their national party ? 
  on a tangent , there appears to be only one european party ( the [ pes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_european_socialists#member_parties ) ) which even * stands * in every member state of the eu ( and i ca n't help but notice that in the vast majority of countries , there 's only a single pes member ; in the uk 's case , where there are two , one only stands in northern ireland and the other only stands outside of it ) . 
  being told `` here 's a winner who many of you could n't have voted for if you wanted to '' is a mockery . 
  the legitimacy inherent in a candidate who can be named by a mere 8.2 % of the electorate , because he happens to be endorsed by a `` party '' * which got 28.5 % of the vote on a 43 % turnout , really is nothing worth getting worked up about . 
  \\* i put that in inverted commas because i believe the numbers of people who actually thought `` i shall go and vote epp '' as opposed to `` i shall go and vote for my country 's centre/right party '' is insignificant . 
  i acknowledge that i could be wrong , but as an example , did campaign literature/posters in germany say `` vote epp '' or `` vote cdu '' ( or even `` vote merkel '' ) ? 
  the whole notion that the spitzenkandidaten have any sort of legitimacy is rather undermined when you find the proportion of the electorate who had any idea about them at all ; see polling at http://www.aecr.eu/media/aecramr-european-election-poll.pdf, 
  though some of the wording made it sound that way , that 's not what it meant - it was cet/cest that was being proposed . 
   references in this act to advancing the time for general purposes in the united kingdom by one hour are to making the time for general purposes in the united kingdom --  ( a ) during the period of summer time ( within the meaning of the summer time act 1972 ) , two hours in advance of greenwich mean time , and  ( b ) at any other time , one hour in advance of greenwich mean time . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2010-2012/0260/cbill_2010-20120260_en_2.htm#l1g4 ) ), 
  i am perhaps being cynical , but china strikes me as the sort of country that 's more likely to choose a single time zone for administrative convenience than because it 's good for the population as a whole . 
  it would n't put anyone out of sync - the point is countries are out of sync with themselves at the moment . 
  while the us does have some pretty wide timezones in places ( widest looks to be from the west edge of texas to the east edge of alabama , call it around 1500 miles ) , that 's also much closer to the equator where the timezones are naturally wider . 
  chicago and indianapolis are only about 180 miles apart , still an hour 's difference on the timezones . 
  heck , if you look at [ indiana ] ( http://www.worldtimezone.com/time-indiana12.php ) , there 're two time zones in use within that one state . 
  it 's just not that big a bother . 
  i mean , seriously , it 's not as though the eu have crippling problems as it is dealing with the uk , portugal , and finland , is it ? 
  sure , you apply a bit of sense when choosing where to put the boundaries , but having a country that 's west of utc use a timezone that 's east of utc is strange to say the least . 
  aye , i 'm sure we 'll continue to be welcome within the uk family after we `` separate '' , just as we continued to be welcome after we were `` free by ' 93 ''  on a slightly more serious note , i think it 's pretty obvious that the chances of us agreeing on the union are about as high as the chances of getting two crowd estimates that match - but can we at least agree to hope for a high turnout on the day of the referendum , a clear result ( whichever way it is ) , and as little throwing of insults either way as possible ? 
  heaven knows we 've been far too good at kicking the shite out of ourselves in the past ... : - /, 
  very max headroom !, 
  ( `` twenty minutes into the future '' ) . 
  why ? 
  most of what we do day-to-day is domestic anyway . 
  being one hour out from a lot of the continent leaves us a large swathe of the day when we 're all at work together . 
  but by being one hour behind europe , we 're also one hour closer to canada and the us , which makes it that much easier to trade with them too ( consider that california 's eight hours behind us , so you can have a phone call that 's 9am for them and 5pm for us , still comfortably within working hours for both sides ) . 
   or better yet , stick to your own country 's politics and leave scotland for the people that live here ? 
  as much as i appreciate your assumption that i live without scotland , let me reassure you that i do in fact live here ( as , indeed , have all the generations of family that mum 's family tree research has been able to uncover ) , and as such the scottish parliament is as much mine as it is yours . 
  as , indeed , is our uk parliament at westminster ( where a mere six of the 59 sitting mps are snp ) . 
  voter turnout is relevant insomuch as it shows that the snp 's victory is n't entirely down to mass inspiration of the majority of the electorate - though i fully acknowledge that their electoral performance in 2011 , four years after taking power as a minority administration was indeed impressive . 
  i understand perfectly well how we vote here , though i fear that either your memory or your grasp of maths has failed you . 
  looking at the [ results on wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_parliament_election,_2011#result ) , the snp hold 16 of the 56 regional seats ( or a little under 29 % - nothing like your 55 % figure ) - which goes with the slightly under 73 % of constituencies that they won . 
  had you meant to refer to the total figure , the snp won 69 of the 129 seats , or around 53 % - obviously they 're down to 65 now , with one msp now the presiding officer , and then there were the two msps who resigned from the snp over nato policy , plus bill walker 's belated resignation after his well-publicised convictions for domestic violence . 
  i was wrong , though , in citing the snp as taking 42 % of the vote - it was closer to 45 % ( a little more in the constituency vote , a little less in the regional vote ) . 
  if you 'd bothered to follow the wikipedia link i supplied , you 'd find that panelbase are the only pollster to have found less than a 10 % lead for no , along with their somewhat dubious finding of a 1 % yes lead ( poll commissioned by the snp , and the independence question asked after a couple of very leading questions ) . 
  perhaps if you brushed up on the polls by reading that article you 'd wonder a bit why panelbase 's results are so wildly different from every other respected pollster 's . 
  yeah , in hindsight that 's not the greatest timezone map . 
  it was the first halfway decent map i found which actually showed the zones in bands ( as opposed to simply colouring in the countries ) , which was large enough to be able to see europe with a bit of detail . 
  http://www.worldtimezone.com/ has a more accurate looking map , or there 's http://www.worldtimezone.com/wtz008.php which is zoomed in on europe . 
  yeah , it is a bit .

  the economy of the usa seems to have somehow survived its [ nine different timezones ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/time_in_the_united_states ) ( call it four if you prefer for just the contiguous continental state timezones ) . 
  and it 's not as though business absolutely requires every single company to be able to speak to every other company across the entire zone for its entire working day , is it ? 
  obviously you 're referring to members of the scottish parliament with your 55 % figure , of whom the vast majority are snp . 
  who were elected by slightly less than a quarter of the electorate ( something like 42 % of the vote on a 50 % turnout ? ) . 
  as to widespread support across the board - that 's certainly what alex salmond would like us to believe . 
  it 's not what the opinion polls have been telling us , though ; only one pollster has found less than a 10 % lead for the no campaign , and only when the poll was bought by the snp did even that pollster manage to find a yes lead which was less than the margin of error ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#2013, 
  looking at a map , what odds on france , belgium , and the netherlands joining their natural timezone too ? 
  it would seem to make a lot of sense ; indeed , when you look at a map like this - http://www.nrgi.fr/acc/objet/timezonemap2.jpg - it 's pretty daft that france , belgium , and the netherlands are n't on utc too . 
  quite why people think that it 's essential for most european countries to have a single timezone , when large countries like the us and russia manage with 5 + zones in a single country , is beyond me . 
  i 'd normally think of it as a generically british pudding , though having glanced at the [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sticky_toffee_pudding ) it appears there 's a claim for its origin in aberdeen . 
  so we 'll count it as scottish for the purposes of nomming on gooey tastiness , 
  wikipedia has a decent summary and links to the full polls here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2014_%28united_kingdom%29#2013, 
  aye - it 's cruel that so many of the things we love in scotland are , shall we say , not entirely good for us !, 
  uk is divided into 12 regions , which elect between 3 and 10 meps using the [ d'hondt method ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%27hondt_method ) of pr using closed party lists . 
   in the european parliament they are not called parties but political groups . . although those groups are usually composed of members from a single european party : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_political_party#current_europarties, 
   neeps there was quite an entertaining article in the guardian about neeps , swedes , and turnips ... http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/jan/25/neeps-swede-or-turnip, 
  we 'd want to do a modern take , though . 
  so it 'd be deep fried . 
  with a deep fried creme egg for afters , 
   interesting how people in the uk think that terrorism is a much more serious problem then the rest of europe people in the uk have had a lot more experience with it on the whole i think - other than the 7/7 bombings , there was the lengthy terror campaign waged by the ira . 
  can add in edinburgh myself . . , 
  i view it as barbaric , but it does n't affect my views towards spanish people in general as i do n't assume they 're all hugely supportive . 
  i do find it quite offensive that i contribute towards supporting it , though ( yes , my personal contribution will be absolutely miniscule - but the thought that other countries are paying anything at all towards supporting it is plain wrong ) .
