  bankers and real estate owners , to name two :-), 
  that probably has a lot to do with spain 's unemployment rate being around 25 % , while the uk 's rate is less than 8 % . 
   and one hypermarket i think     costco . 
  makro are similar to costco , and i 'm sure there are other cash 'n' carry type places as well - i would n't really say that those are particularly common though , costco for example only have 26 stores across the uk . 
  whereas the supermarkets you listed must be in the high hundreds if not low thousands . 
  guess what the 25 artificial reefs off of the andalusian cost were made of ? 
  as rhodes put it - `` remember that you are an englishman , and have consequently won first prize in the lottery of life . '', 
  would be fair to say that mass-market british cars were n't that great . 
  do n't think that there are any left now though , the remaining british manufacturers are all small niche ones . 
  mind you , when we 're making someone else 's cars , we can do it really well ( see : nissan in sunderland ) . 
  no kidding , especially considering that there 've been proposals ( which have stayed no more than proposals ) for a long time for some sort of water `` national grid '' which would be able to transport water from areas which are over-supplied , to areas in drought . 
  this sounds like confusion with some uk utility companies being owned by french ones ( eg edf ) . 
  fairly sure there 've been attempts by belgian chocolate producers in the past to have the uk stuff renamed as something like ` vegelate ' due to non-cocoa content . 
  edit : yeah - ended a long time ago now with a compromise though !, 
  it 's not so much an odd custom , as ( historically at least ) it 's hard to justify the expense of installing something you 'd `` need '' for about four weeks in the middle of the year . 
  well , let 's be generous , and say that all of those 100,000 people who can speak esperanto fluently are in the eu . 
  eu has a population around 500,000,000 . 
  so if we standardised on esperanto , then 499,900,000 people are going to need to learn a new language . 
  if we standardised on klingon , and let 's say there are a mere 20 fluent speakers , then 499,999,980 people are going to need to learn a new language . 
  it 's not exactly a significant difference either way , is it ? 
  it 's basically the exact same sort of artificial reef as is used in numerous locations around the spanish coast ( indeed , i 've seen a claim although i ca n't verify it , that the concrete used actually came from spain ) . 
  however , because gibraltar is doing this and it 's affecting one spanish fishing vessel , it 's obviously * totally * worth making into an international incident . 
  it 's still a minority hobby as opposed to a useful language , though . 
  ah , but you get your revenge by having it so that english spoken with an irish accent is about the most attractive version of the language , 
  mind you , the criticism mentions that klingon appears to be outselling esperanto . 
  how about we standardise on that ? 
  you 've used the english version of the uk 's royal coat of arms across scotland too - if you check [ this wikipedia page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_united_kingdom ) you 'll see it should be a different one in scotland . 
  not exhaustive , but amongst other changes the quarters on the central shield change around , its surround changes , the supporters switch sides , it 's a different style and colour of lion on top , the motto changes ... 
  hey , i still remember bits of french that i learned at school some twenty-something years ago ... like one from that `` useful transport phrases '' list , which will probably stick with me forever . 
  * yes , i can accost random passing strangers to let them know about my transport related failures !, 
  would seem more useful to use a language that 's already widely spoken - even french , 
  for that matter the welsh dragon is ( as usual ) missing too ... suffice to say i 've yet to see a pleasant looking combination of the flags ( barring e-i-andy-oh 's masterpiece ) !, 
  just playing around some more , you could perhaps superimpose the union jack on the tricolore along these lines : http://i.imgur.com/m0oxp9x.jpg or perhaps even do some other combination , like this grouping of the scottish , english , and french ones : http://i.imgur.com/van8pli.jpg all look vaguely wrong due to the slightly different shades of red and blue used , i 'm honestly not sure how on earth you could make a nice flag out of the combination ... 
  making a combined flag from two copies of each was one thought , but i have to admit it looks pretty hideous . 
  so if the uk was to formally absorb gibraltar into the uk , would spain be happy ? 
   right now the more important issues for most spaniards are the fishing problem ( what the current crisis is all about ) the really daft thing here is that this `` fishing problem '' affects precisely one boat , the divina providencia , which is the only one that was fishing where gibraltar 's installed an artificial reef ( of a similar type to that used in numerous places around the spanish coast ) . 
  if spain 's threatening a $ 50 charge per person crossing the border to make up for their losses , just how profitable was that boat in the first place ?!, 
  were they fishing diamonds ? 
  we agree that it 's been british longer than it was ever spanish , then ? 
  probably more accurate to say that gibraltar has been british for longer than it was spanish . 
  if we take spain 's founding date of 1479 from the catholic monarchs , then it 's 234 years to 1713 when the treaty of utrecht was signed in which spain ceded `` the full and entire propriety of the town and castle of gibraltar , together with the port , fortifications , and forts thereunto belonging ... for ever , without any exception or impediment whatsoever . '', 
  obviously it 's now 300 years since the treaty of utrecht . 
   segro plc , an industrial landlord with # 1.2 billion of assets around heathrow , in july told the u.k. government 's commission on airports that a shift away from heathrow would cause significant damage to property values and the wider economy . 
  why am i not entirely surprised that a company with large business interests in the heathrow area thinks that a move away from heathrow would be a terrible , terrible thing ? 
  actually south west england - but yes , there 's no way they could 've had their own mep with a population of , what , 35,000 or so ? 
  now now , dirk was n't totally abandoned by the electorate . 
  he got a respectable third place for the liberal democrats in [ chelsea and fulham ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chelsea_and_fulham_%28uk_parliament_constituency%29 ) at the last general election . 
  not , of course , that his own website has much to say about the liberal democrats ; it links to '' [ ukepp ] ( http://dirkhazell.com/links ) '' , the `` uk in europe party '' . 
  would n't be totally surprised if he 'd been involved with the old pro euro conservative party , too . 
  so as much as i 'm sure the conservative party values his mainstream input , given his undoubted track record of electoral success ... 
  why should free markets require an eu-style solution ? 
  i 'm thinking of efta and nafta as examples , albeit with a lot less countries involved , of countries agreeing free trade between each other . 
  yet rejoining the epp would be tacitly endorsing the epp 's federalist position , which the uk tories oppose . 
  less influence where they are now , yes , but at least honest . 
   if the government had intevened the british motor industry coud have been saved . 
  was n't it government intervention that resulted in the nationalised british leyland behemoth ? 
  that really did n't fix it ... 
  as neoliberal says - the rot had set in for the british car industry a long , long time before thatcher came to power . 
  sadly , the nationalised british leyland group was practically a showcase in poor management and operation - you name it , be it management , unions , quality , designs , brands - they buggered it up : - /, 
  do you not see the difference between `` agreeing that you wo n't have to participate , and you not participating '' and `` agreeing that you wo n't participate , and then making you participate anyway but with extra promises that you wo n't lose out '' ? 
  to offer a rather stretched analogy - if we agreed that i would not kick you in the bollocks , would you perceive a difference between me not kicking you in the bollocks , and me kicking you in the bollocks but getting a nice girl to kiss it better ? 
  the normal interpretation of `` opt-out '' is `` you do n't have to participate in this thing '' . 
  in this case , `` opt-out '' becomes `` you 're going to participate in this anyway , but we 're going to make some extra promises so that you wo n't lose out '' . 
  in practical terms , yes , it functions much the same . 
  but it still teaches us that we ca n't trust what the eu says . 
  point is still - in 2010 , we were led to believe that the uk would have an absolute `` opt-out from participating in any further bailouts for eurozone countries '' . 
  a few years later , the eu needs to scrape up some cash , and lo and behold the efsm looks convenient . 
  even if additional guarantees end up being given to avoid risking uk funding , the * impression * is that you ca n't actually trust the eu to stick to what appear to be pretty clear agreements . 
  that 's normally considered to be the case . 
  iirc in this case a lot of the `` do n't know '' grouping are loosely pro leaving , but worried about possible impact ; if the leave campaign can alleviate fears there 're a lot of extra leave votes out there . 
   the uk is n't affected by greece and will never be . 
  see , you can think that , your government can think they 've got a pretty solid agreement there , and then you get stuff like '' [ european commission proposes using uk contributions towards greek bailout ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/15/european-commission-proposes-using-uk-contributions-towards-greek-bailout ) '' chucked up again . 
  it 's impossible to have any faith in it . 
  you do rather famously have a ~ ~ nice ~ ~ cheap airline ( ryanair ) , mind you !, 
  also beer . 
   ireland is a respected , far-away country that does little to offend others so it 's also easy for them to negotiate opt-outs too . 
  i think in their case it 's a fairly natural extension of not being in schengen , which is mostly down to their only land border being with the non-schengen uk . 
  i guess because it 's not really in many people 's interests to publicise it . 
  * car manufacturers hardly want to draw attention to the way they 're ( entirely legally ) dodging paying a federal tax * i doubt the government wants to draw attention to how easy it is for their `` gas guzzler tax '' ( which * sounds * as though they 're doing something ) to be circumvented * the folk who probably * would * draw attention to this , like greenpeace , are likely perceived as anti-car anyway and so who wants to listen to them !, 
  car wise , i used to enjoy driving a [ second-gen mr2 ] ( http://jink.org/mr2/front_angle.jpg ) , but once you have a kid that 's no longer particularly practical ( having been told by my wife that putting a child seat in the boot ( trunk ) was not allowed  ) - result being , naturally , that the main family car now is ... a two-litre turbodiesel suv ( albeit i 'm in the uk , so it 's only a small one , a rav4 ) . 
  at least it 's not a wv i suppose , 
  and now you know why car manufacturers love suvs so much . 
  as a quick example - most of the vehicles in that gas guzzler list look to have a combined figure of around 20mpg ( with a few real outliers like the veyron 's 12.6 ) . 
  a 2013-model jeep grand cherokee , for example , comes in between 14 and 19 depending on the model [ according to fueleconomy.gov ] ( https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2013_jeep_grand_cherokee.shtml ) so to pick extreme examples - a bmw 550i ( 22.4 mpg ) is a gas guzzler , while a jeep grand cherokee srt8 ( 14mpg ) is n't ... 
  of course not . 
  suvs are specifically exempt , per the bit i bolded in the above quote !, 
  if manufacturers sold vehicles as `` station wagons '' , they 'd be caught by the gas guzzler tax . 
  by selling `` suvs '' ... they are n't . 
  having checked , it 's fuel efficiency regulations that suvs are used to circumvent ; from http://www3.epa.gov/fueleconomy/guzzler/index.htm  congress established gas guzzler tax provisions in the energy tax act of 1978 to discourage the production and purchase of fuel-inefficient vehicles . 
  the gas guzzler tax is assessed on new cars that do not meet required fuel economy levels . 
  ** these taxes apply only to passenger cars . 
  trucks , minivans , and sport utility vehicles ( suv ) are not covered because these vehicle types were not widely available in 1978 and were rarely used for non-commercial purposes . 
  ** the irs is responsible for administering the gas guzzler program and collecting the taxes from car manufacturers or importers . 
  the amount of tax is posted on the window stickers of new cars - the lower the fuel economy , the higher the tax . 
  not hard to join the dots between the decline of the station wagon and rise of the suv , is it ? 
  what do you make of the washington post 's motoring correspondent 's claim that the standards are n't the same , and that 's why the shift ? 
  [ full quote here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3m4hsp/angela_merkels_ministers_ignored_warning_over/cvcffw4 ) . 
  . . which ford dodge by installing seats and windows , importing the vehicles , then ripping out ( and shredding ) the seats and windows before they 're ever used so that they can then sell the vehicle as a light truck again . 
  - http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb125357990638429655 that 's an impressively stupid tax . 
  because of the relative disappearance of station wagons , thanks to federal cafe regulations which chrysler 's lee iaccocca realised could be worked around by selling ` light trucks ' rather than ` cars ' .
