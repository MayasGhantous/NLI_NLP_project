  to quote the [ washington post 's columnist warren brown ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/04/06/di2007040601383.html ) :  most sport-utility vehicles and all crossover utility models are used the way we once used station wagons in the 1950s -- to haul lots of people and their stuff . 
  but the fuel crises of the early 1970s came along and changed all of that . 
  congress , lacking prescience and wisdom , implemented corporate average fuel economy , which required automakers to sell new-vehicle fleets that met certain fuel economy standards , but did nothing to require or encourage consumers to buy them . 
   the upshot was the disappearance , for a while , of large station wagons and sedans that would 've pushed car companies into the cafe penalty lane . 
   but back then , both democrats and republicans labored under the notion that trucks should have lower fuel economy standards because trucks were used for blue-collar work and commercial hauling . 
  and what democrat would want to offend workers ? 
   but a smart fella , named lee iaccocca , figured that trucks could be converted to minivans to carry people the same way station wagons once carried people -- without running afoul of cafe . 
  it was a stroke of genius !, 
  minivans begot sport-utility vehicles . 
  suvs begot crossover utility models . 
  thus , here we are today -- largely thanks to the myopia of the federal government . 
  are n't emission / fuel efficiency standards far lower for light trucks than for cars , which is part of the reason that us car firms have pushed light trucks so much ? 
  ( willing to be proved wrong , but that 's the impression i 'd been given ), 
  during the scottish independence referendum , the yes campaign were pretty adamant that this sort of claim ( that independence would force scotland to leave the eu ) was nonsense on stilts . 
   `` there is , within the eu treaties , a legal framework by which scotland , a country that has been an integral part of the eu for 40 years , may make the transition to independent eu membership in the period between the referendum and the date on which scotland becomes an independent state . 
  article 48 provides a suitable legal route to facilitate the transition process , by allowing the eu treaties to be amended through ordinary revision procedure before scotland becomes independent , to enable it to become a member state at the point of independence . 
   `` there is no treaty provision that would require scotland to leave the eu on independence . '', 
  i was actually wondering what 's happened to pasok , they do n't even seem to register on that poll ? 
  they believe that minimum unit pricing :  \u2022 will be ineffective in tackling alcohol misuse  \u2022 will penalise responsible drinkers and put more pressure on household budgets  \u2022 is illegal  \u2022 will damage the scotch whisky industry .

  if only more folk could take on board learnings from the great bill and ted !, 
   be excellent to each other . 
  so , will broadcasters start using this as the general campaign theme tune ? 
  also an official language in malta . 
  unless you count [ greenland in 1982 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greenlandic_european_economic_community_membership_referendum,_1982 ) ( which narrowly voted to leave then then-eec ) , then yes . 
  i do n't know if it 's similar in other european countries , but in general the younger generation was a lot more ` hardline ' ; other examples :  60 % of muslims would prefer to send their children to a mixed state school , compared to 35 % who would prefer to send their child to an islamic school . 
  there is a clear age difference . 
  37 % of 16-24 year olds preferred to send their children to islamic state schools , compared to 25 % of 45-54 year olds and 19 % of 55 + year olds . 
   59 % of muslims would prefer to live under british law , compared to 28 % who would prefer to live under * sharia * law . 
  37 % of 16-24 year olds prefer * sharia * compared to 17 % of 55 + year olds . 
   74 % of 16-24 year olds would prefer muslim women to choose to wear the veil , compared to only 28 % of 55 + year olds . 
  even in the west , there 're substantial minorities . 
  a [ 2007 poll ] ( http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/living%20apart%20together%20-%20jan%2007.pdf ) of muslims in the uk , for example , suggested :  36 % of 16-24 year olds believe if a muslim converts to another religion they should be punished by death , compared to 19 % of 55 + year olds . 
  they did recommend a change to the original scottish referendum question , which was `` do you agree that scotland should be an independent country ? '' .

  perhaps in the wake of that , they 're now favouring a less yes/no question ? 
  the article does , though , have this direct quote :  `` every country that is a part of the eu should do their share , and that goes for everyone , '' he said . 
  `` sooner or later there will be a mechanism that makes it compulsory for all countries to do their share , because that 's the way europe works . '', 
  `` makes it compulsory '' is n't a million miles from `` forced '' , though i 'll grant it 's not the exact same word . 
  ` unpleasant ' perhaps , but i do n't think ` bland ' is particularly affected by whether you 're familiar with a foodstuff or not ? 
   it is basicly a rock in the ocean that more or less also describes the shetland islands , which are n't a million miles from the faeroes , and which also historically hunted whales . 
  yet as far as i can tell , whaling had pretty much stopped by around 1930 ( and although there 's oil wealth in the shetlands now , that would 've come far later - the 1970s or so ) . 
  what makes the faroes so different ? 
   majority of the food in my country is imported and living of imported food only , would make it impossible for me to hold everyone in my family alive due to the colossal import taxes - i 'm not well paid and it 's one of the things that keeps our economy leveled . 
  i have to wonder , why do the faroes level `` colossal import taxes '' on essentials like foodstuffs ? 
  your argument seems to hinge a lot on `` other food ends up too expensive , so we need to butcher whales '' . 
  if imported food * was n't * so highly taxed , and was more affordable - would you still need to conduct whaling ? 
  from the wikipedia article on whale meat , there 's a note that when permitted in the uk during ww2 , it `` was not popular because of the smell whilst cooking was deemed ` unpleasant ' , and the taste was considered ` bland ' even when spiced '' - that does n't really sound as though it 's necessarily desirable food at the best of times ? 
  given the choice , would you choose it over any other food ? 
  that 's sort of what i meant - we do n't recall churchill for gallipoli , we recall him for his leadership and speeches in ww2 . 
  had villeneuve gone on to have some other amazing victory i 'm sure he 'd have been remembered more , but when his main `` achievement '' is a famous defeat it 's hardly surprising his country prefers to remember other leaders . 
  / u/tigernmas is n't talking about what 's going to happen after the next general election - but the current situation where , after the largest party fails to make a government , the greek constitution allows the second and third largest groupings of mps to have a go . 
  before this split , golden dawn were the third largest . 
  now , they 're fourth , and they wo n't get a go before an election is called . 
  sure , this new grouping might well do absolutely terribly and be wiped out , but if nothing else they 've kept golden dawn off the table * right now * . 
  rather superbly from that ,  on 14 december 1941 the dutch minelayer jan van brakel , which was serving as a convoy escort on the uk eastern coast , accidentally hit the anchor buoy of one of the gate vessels which were protecting the entrance to the medway during wwii . 
  the commander reported this incident to the port authorities , signalling : `` van brakel damaged boom defence medway '' . 
  the instant reply was : `` what , again ? 
  hard to imagine many countries wanting to commemorate a leader who got their forces wrecked !, 
  aye , i 'd have said something like the [ battle of britain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_britain ) , there 's something truly intense about churchill 's rhetoric ( and it 's hard to read without hearing it in his voice !, 
  ) :  what general weygand has called the battle of france is over . 
  the battle of britain is about to begin . 
  upon this battle depends the survival of christian civilisation . 
  upon it depends our own british life and the long continuity of our institutions and our empire . 
  the whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us . 
  hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war . 
  if we can stand up to him , all europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad , sunlit uplands . 
  but if we fail , then the whole world , including the united states , including all that we have known and cared for , will sink into the abyss of a new dark age made more sinister , and perhaps more protracted , by the lights of a perverted science . 
  let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties , and so bear ourselves that , if the british empire and its commonwealth last for a thousand years , men will still say , `` this was their finest hour '' . 
   for over 30 years since records restarted they 've been higher in nearly every one of those years no , no they have n't . 
  scotland 's deficit per capita has been lower than ruk three times in the last fifteen years . 
  here , have a read through this very readable article : http://chokkablog.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/full-fiscal-autonomy-for-dummies.html numbers are heavily sourced from the scottish government 's own gers figures . 
  i 'm reminded of an old bloom county strip ... http://www.thecomicstrips.com/store/add.php?iid=86276, 
  [ yep ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_smeaton_%28born_1976%29 ) ,  asked by itv news what his message to terrorists was , he said :  `` glasgow does n't accept this . 
  this is glasgow ; we 'll set about ye . '', 
  it seems weird that neither spain nor argentina has hit on the method of trying to win over the inhabitants of the particular territory they 're interested in . 
  in the very article we 're nominally commenting on :  on foreign policy , for example , corbyn would vote to scrap britain 's trident nuclear weapons system and would seek to withdraw from nato . 
  sure they do . 
  they all go to places that are n't in belgium !, 
  ( i kid , i kid ... ), 
  probably the same sort of chap who 'd say  we are with europe , but not of it . 
  yes , it 's a very old quote - the point being that 1975 was the last time that the uk electorate had a direct say on our relationship with what was then the eec , and was told * then * that it was all about the common market . 
  since then , the eec has become the ec , and now the eu - it 's changed substantially , but the electorate 's never been consulted directly on these changes . 
  ( yes , the option of voting for anti-eu parties like ukip at general elections exists , but general elections are about far more than just our relations with europe ) . 
  looks like there are actually 11 , or perhaps 12 ( hard to tell , cyprus is awfully close to zero either way ) per this bbc article 's infographic : http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8036097.stm it 's five that have a net contribution over $ 1bn ( germany , uk , netherlands , france , italy ) . 
  the guardian 's hardly the only paper to do decent investigative journalism , mind you ; the daily telegraph broke a small story a couple of years ago about mps ' expenses , for example ... 
  / u/mrhahahaaaa is probably thinking of things like :  `` there are some in this country who fear that in going into europe we shall in some way sacrifice independence and sovereignty . 
  these fears , i need hardly say , are completely unjustified . '',

  interesting bit of research here : http://www.seat61.com/uk-europe-train-fares-comparison.html with the exception of tickets bought for peak travel on the day of travel , uk rail fares are typically * cheaper * than comparable journeys in europe . 
  no , i would n't have guessed that either . 
  ca n't really see pro-eu factions of either the labour or conservative parties being impressed by the idea of a lib dem leading it up , not to mention that you could probably * still * get `` no '' votes by explaining that voting no will annoy the lib dems ... ( cf : av referendum ), 
   david coburn mep , their sole elected representative in scotland this ca n't be stated too clearly - he is their * sole * elected representative here . 
  no mps , no msps , and not even a single * councillor * elected . 
  looking quickly , the bit west of oslo will be the hardangervidda national park ( which is rather lacking in having loads of roads ) . 
  the one a little southwest of the 's ' in sweden will be the bl\u00e5fjella-skj\u00e6kerfjella national park ( again , lacking in tons of roads ) . 
  at a guess the stuff way up north is more mountainy than roady ... 
  your dad was n't a french farmer , though ... 
  feels like it 'd make a lot of sense to form some cooperatives between farmers , and sell their produce themselves ; the combination of being able to sell produce as locally grown , and not having huge transport costs to bring it there ( which the supermarkets would incur to bring goods in from elsewhere ) should make it fairly competitive .
