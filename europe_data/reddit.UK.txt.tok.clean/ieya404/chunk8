  heck , you could even do the price tags to show exactly how much of the purchase price will be going to the farmers who produced it . 
  probably also if the [ elgin/parthenon marbles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elgin_marbles ) have been in the news recently . 
  looks like it * only * shows connections up to 150km - as london-paris is over 300km , that 's why it 's not shown . 
  weird map . 
  basically anything that was on the un-fun side of the iron curtain ? 
  i 'd also accept papyrus . 
  given the figure , i can only assume it 's an all-in cost to include all of those . 
  i agree that cost sounds high ( hence my !, 
  in brackets ) - but what incentive would a pro-metrication organisation have to make the cost sound higher than it needs to be ? 
  during an exam , probably not !, 
  [ this 2006 guardian article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/23/transport.immigrationpolicy ) suggests that :  uk metric association will say it would cost # 80m to switch all 200,000 road signs on the highway network from miles to kilometres . 
  so that 's an estimate of around # 400 per sign ( ! ), 
  - though you 'd not expect a pro-metrication group to over-inflate the cost ? 
  the only shame being that later on , the guardian article notes that  about 4m roadsigns in the uk use imperial measurements , including those showing distances , speed limits , height and width indicators if you multiply up that # 400 per sign figure by four million signs , that 's a slightly unpleasant # 1.6 bn ... 
   we are small countries . 
  all of us . 
  even germany or france . 
  80 millions people ? 
  look at china , india or the us . 
  on a global scale , we do n't matter much individually . 
  if germany , the fifteenth largest country in the world by population , `` does n't matter much individually '' , are you really suggesting that all the other countries which are smaller do n't matter much either ? 
  those countries represent around 2.4 billion people ... 
  am surprised - is ` cope ' really that unusual a word to come across ? 
   ( a ) not let them into france in the first place difficult , since they come into france via other schengen countries which france does n't have border controls with ... 
   it covers the electrical system of countries like germany and new zealand . 
  fantastic almost-homonym , but i 'm pretty sure you meant electoral system rather than electrical system , 
  i guess by your location you may have a better idea than i do , but i was under the impression that eu membership was still fairly popular ? 
   there is n't anything in eu laws that says anything about refuges . 
  what do you think the [ dublin regulation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation ) is , then ? 
  so schulz [ has claimed ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/17/greek-crisis-austria-default-ecb-banks-live#block-55815531e4b0e91d8f409850 )  `` i think that leaving the euro is also leaving the european union '' . 
  even if greece were to exit the euro , does anyone really think the eu would n't find some fudge that kept greece as a member ? 
  put your cynical hat on - how many votes do you think the french administration want to see go to the fn ? 
  italy has form in making this sort of threat ; last time france suggested it might be necessary to consider suspending schengen : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/8468981/france-threatens-to-suspend-schengen-treaty.html, 
   the sun/scottish sun - bizarre and changeable political allegiances . 
  could probably be simply explained as `` supports whoever looks likely to win in the near future '' . 
  basically i 'm happy to coexist peacefully with anyone else , and any other culture , providing that culture is equally at ease with allowing people to hold their own beliefs and viewpoints ( provided they 're not being forced on or harming anyone else ) . 
  naah , i 'm pretty sure that any scot , or brit , or indeed irishman would agree that scotland makes the best whisky . 
  ireland , on the other hand , makes pretty good whiskey . 
   my british bank consistently rips me off when i travel anywhere in the eurozone yeah , handiest answer i 've found there is to pick up a credit card which has no usage fees ( no cash withdrawal fee , no fee to use it anywhere worldwide , no annual fee ) . 
  it 's not as though there has n't been speculation in the past . 
  russia 's fairly able to deliver cheap gas , apart from anything else ... http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/07/alexis-tsipras-flies-to-moscow-speculation-greek-bailout-vladimir-putin, 
  might be more wanting to keep russia on good terms with a possible eye to being bailed out ... 
  the article suggests :  but with poland ( 27 votes ) , hungary ( 12 votes ) , the czech republic ( 12 votes ) and now spain ( 27 votes ) rejecting the proposal and estonia ( 4 votes ) , lithuania ( 7 votes ) and finland ( 7 votes ) likely also opposing it , the commission would fall short of a qualified majority with just 213 votes in favor . 
  may not totally help ; apparently countries can force a reversion to the old voting system , which has numbers of votes rather than simply reflecting population :  povej\u0161il said that his country would be ready to enforce a special clause of the eu treaties , which gives each member state the right to demand a return to the old voting system . 
  `` this gives us more room to block the proposal in the council . 
  we 're confident that we can achieve that . ''  under the old voting system , the total number of votes of all eu countries is 352 -- or , in the case of the migration agenda -- 309 , since the uk , ireland and denmark have the right not to participate in the migration agenda and therefore ca n't vote on it . 
   to achieve the necessary qualified majority , juncker 's agenda would need to receive at least 72 percent of these 309 votes , meaning 223 . 
   but with poland ( 27 votes ) , hungary ( 12 votes ) , the czech republic ( 12 votes ) and now spain ( 27 votes ) rejecting the proposal and estonia ( 4 votes ) , lithuania ( 7 votes ) and finland ( 7 votes ) likely also opposing it , the commission would fall short of a qualified majority with just 213 votes in favor . 
  the three national scottish titles have been around for quite a while - the scotsman since 1817 , the herald since 1783 , and the daily record since 1895 . 
  you also have major regional titles like the courier ( 1801 ) and the press and journal ( 1748 ) . 
  the one change in recent years is the launch , last year , of the national - an explicitly pro-independence daily newspaper ( in contrast to the existing daily papers , all of which are pro-union - the sole existing paper to support independence was the sunday herald ) . 
  the figures are taken from [ yougov ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/06/08/general-election-2015-how-britain-really-voted/ ) , who do note that the figure for the mirror includes the daily record , and the figures for the star and mail include their respective scottish editions . 
  quite right to note that the scotsman and herald are left out , mind you , as indeed is the national ( where it would actually be mildly interesting to know how much of its readership * did n't * vote snp ) . 
  looking at the [ full data tables ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/owc2a5orpr/establishment_extra_variables_website.pdf ) , the snp 's best paper is the daily record ( where they got 6 % of the combined mirror/record readership 's vote ) , followed by the sun ( 4 % ) and star , guardian , and independent ( 3 % each time ) . 
  probably not entirely unsurprisingly , the one paper 's readership they could n't even reach 1 % support from was the telegraph . 
  . . that you ca n't count on france to defend itself ? 
  ( i kid , i kid ), 
  i 've seen suggestions that it should be headed up by a non-politician , someone like sir james dyson - i suspect that 'd go over a lot better than a party politician . 
  norway does , however , have the right of veto - which we do n't . 
  as far as i know it 's only been used once , in reference to the postal services directive ( which is what 's forced the part-privatisation of the royal mail ) ; see [ this 2011 article ] ( http://theforeigner.no/pages/news/postal-directive-majority-sends-norwegian-pms-policy-packing/ ) discussing norway 's parliament voting to refuse it . 
  while that , and other articles at the time , discussed potential consequences , i 'm not actually aware of any happening in the four years since ... 
  worth bearing in mind , brende is a member of h\u00f8yre ( norway 's main centre/right party ) , which `` has historically been the most outspokenly pro-european union party in norway , supporting norwegian membership during both the 1972 and 1994 referendums '' . 
  hardly a surprise that a member of a pro-eu party is in favour of another country staying in . 
  i know it 's just done as fun , but there 's a lot of land there that 's closer to scotland , denmark , or indeed norway ... would actually be interesting to contemplate whether norway would get some of the land across the trench from the norwegian mainland ... 
  i was wondering about that too - what on earth is the significance that made it worth flagging up ? 
  weird list . 
  slightly struggling to see why they 'd think that ( for example ) the director general of mi5 would be travelling to russia anyway ... 
   the lancaster is quite small compared to its us counterparts , i 'm impressed they managed to fit it in . 
  surprisingly enough , it 's actually the lancaster ( and other british bombers ) that had the high capacity !, 
  from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blockbuster_bomb  these high capacity bombs were only used by the raf , being too big to fit in the bomb bays of other countries ' aircraft . 
  does n't seem like there 's much point if you ca n't get the countries which have low corporation taxes on board , though ? 
  interesting ; i wonder how on earth france and germany think they 'll win over smaller countries like ireland and luxembourg , then ? 
   the eu ca n't do it without ireland 's permission . 
  is this definitely still an area where everyone has a veto - it 's not gone to qmv ? 
  across the entire eu , the only country to * not * have a voting age of 18 is austria ( where it 's 16 ) . 
  i am comfortable in trusting 18 as a sensible cut-off point . 
  it feels rather naive to assume that people will ever completely disassociate an act with the country it 's from ( just look at how the public votes go ! ) . 
  if they really do n't want to risk people booing the russian act for being russian , then perhaps they should consider suspending russia 's entries for a while until they 're not actively invading neighbouring countries with lost and holidaying troops ... 
  yeah , you 're really getting behind with the curries and kebabs in france i hear , 
  pdf 's not exactly handy if you want to continue working on the presentation , though ... 
  you mean the same cake that the efta countries are already eating , without being in the eu ? 
  [ you 'd be surprised ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-1051,00.html ) . 
   i do not know what happens to the voting slips for conservative candidates , after they have been counted , but in the mid-1960s those for communists were tallied against their counterfoils in the ballot books ( just like cheque books ) and those who had had the temerity to vote for a communist were identified from the electoral roll . 
  their names were forwarded to special branch and to mi5 , almost certainly as a matter of routine . 
  the source for this information was a good one . 
  he was a postgraduate student doing his doctoral research on local government in a midlands steel town where he was attached to the town clerk 's department . 
  one day he opened a cupboard , looking for some documents , and found instead a large number of ballot slips , all of which were marked in favour of a communist candidate in the local elections . 
  the town clerk returned and found the student with the slips and told him ( knowing the student 's safely right-wing views ) that it was one of his regular chores to forward the names of communist voters to the special branch . 
  as the town had a strong communist tradition it was a recurrent task for the town clerk and the slips had been put to one side until he had time to deal with them . 
  the then student ( my informant ) saw nothing wrong with this procedure - which made his account the more believable . 
   he caught a cleaning lady stealing and offered her to shoot a video as a compensation . 
  when even the cleaners are that good looking ... it 's not a country that 's been on the receiving end of a beating with the ugly stick , is it !, 
  it 's termed `` incitement of racial hatred '' here , and [ is a thing in the uk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incitement_to_ethnic_or_racial_hatred#united_kingdom ) too , yes . 
  other than the cost , quite possibly another factor is mentioned in [ this telegraph reporting ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/11604991/greece-knows-there-is-no-legal-right-to-the-elgin-marbles-thats-why-it-wont-sue-the-uk.html ) :  the surprise announcement came only 48 hours after amal clooney and the team at london 's doughty street chambers sent the greek government a 150-page report admitting that there was ** only a 15 % chance of their success in a british court ** , and that greece should consider pursuing the claim at the international court of justice . 
  however , quite understandably , the greek government has decided that what clooney is really saying is that they have no case . 
   the syriza government is keenly aware that british courts are recognized the world over for their experience in resolving international disputes , including those involving british interests and institutions . 
  so , quite reasonably , the new greek government has concluded that ** an international court will probably not reach a different conclusion ** . 
  nikos xydakis , culture minister , has therefore announced that greece will drop its legal claim and pursue `` diplomatic and political '' avenues instead . 
  i do n't imagine many governments would like going to court with an 85 % chance of being told they 're in the wrong - that would crush their chances in the long run i think . 
  do n't carriers generally leave the bulk of defense to other ships in their group ?
