  why is the uk `` lucky '' ? 
  all other eu countries must 've agreed to the opt-out in the first place , and it was their choice to not get one themselves at the time ( barring ireland and denmark , who also did ) ... 
  obviously that 's a caricature of the uk 's actual position , but you need to remember - the uk ( and ireland , and denmark ) only have these opt-outs because everyone else agreed with them too ... 
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3513889.stm has a fairly comprehensive overview of what various states did . 
  hypothetically , i can see that a benevolent dictatorship might be better ( as it can afford to take decisions which benefit in the long-term , at the cost of short-term popularity ) . 
  the trouble is in arranging for the dictator to be benevolent , which i think has generally eluded the real world so far ... 
  ah , i was looking at the numbers in [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/359lg1/results_of_the_british_election/cr2jkhr ) , which has more accurately modelled the results on the german system . 
  apologies for the confusion . 
  one is reminded of that classic exchange in yes minister , ending  sun readers do n't care who 's running the country as long as she 's got big tits . 
  that 's a minority in this system , note the total at the bottom of 867 seats . 
  con/ukip would have 446 seats , which would be the only real majority possible . 
  that 's pretty special - i wonder who he thought was running the country , blair ? 
  thatcher ? 
  we 've also just had a demonstration that being a junior coalition partner in the uk , getting a load of policies through , is rewarded by being nearly wiped out ... who the heck would want to be a junior partner now ? 
  as a uk resident who 's politically aware , trust me - we are also simply astonished that an absolute majority was able to happen out of this year . 
  fairly sure the figures you 're thinking of are including off-shore revenues from north sea oil and gas . 
  actual revenues from on-shore activity are fairly consistently about # 250 less than the rest of the uk . 
  to quote from page 10 of '' [ scotland 's economy : the case for independence ] ( http://www.gov.scot/resource/0042/00422987.pdf ) '' published by the scottish government last year , gross domestic product per capita ( # ) | scotland | uk -- | -- | -- onshore only | 23,391 | 28,344 lower gdp per capita rather inevitably leads to lower tax per capita when the tax rates are the same ... 
  the scottish government 's white paper on independence projected revenues of between # 6.8 billion and # 7.9 billion in 2016/17 , when they expected to be independent . 
  current estimates from the obr , following the drop in oil prices , are for # 600 million in that year . 
  still nice to have , certainly , but also about # 6bn short of what the snp were banking on . 
  oil is a lovely bonus when its price and revenues are high - but it 's also very volatile ( as well as being a depleting finite resource ) . 
  yes , that 's exactly what i believe , which is why i put a winking smiley on the end of the sentence to make it absolutely clear i was serious . 
  voted scottish conservative and unionist , though without genuine expectations of them winning ( the last time they won in my constituency , or at least the constituency covering the area where i live , was 1992 ) . 
  had the seat been a lib dem/snp tossup , though , i 'm pretty sure i 'd have voted lib dem . 
  went to the same primary school as boris johnson , that 's close enough , 
  it 's been referred to as an unofficial coalition in eg [ this guardian report ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/10/alex-salmond-hypocrisy-former-scottish-tories-leader-annabel-goldie ) ; scottish conservative votes got all of the snp 's budgets passed , and some scottish conservative policies were adopted in exchange . 
  it certainly was n't a coalition on the scale of the con/ld one that we 've had at westminster , but to claim there was nothing is also rather disingenuous . 
  what makes you think the snp are a socialist party ? 
  many of their populist policies ( frozen council tax , free prescriptions ) help the middle classes far more than they help the poor ... 
  looking purely at the financials : scotland spends around # 1400 per capita more on public services than the uk average ( to be expected - beyond the central belt there 's a very geographically spread out population , not to mention the one-or-two percent of the population that live on outlying islands ; that costs a lot more to provide services to ) . 
  tax receipts per capita are a little lower ( # 250 or so ) than the uk as a whole , too . 
  which adds up to about a # 7bn difference , if we were to go it alone . 
  so you could slash public spending , or raise taxes by around 16 % , or borrow roughly twice as much as we 're borrowing at the moment ( which is n't likely to do great things to our credit rating in the long term ) . 
  now , that * is * excluding revenues from north sea oil and gas ; in the last fifteen years , revenue from that would 've plugged the gap in three of those years . 
  at the moment obviously oil prices are low and revenues are also low ; even when prices recover , revenues are unlikely to ever be as high as they once were , since the ` easy ' oil has already been extracted and it costs more to extract what 's left . 
  so on a purely financial level - it 's not a fantastic idea . 
  thing is , for those of us who * are n't * colour blind , green and orange contrast strongly . 
  colour wise , it looks suspiciously like it 's ie in blue because its icon is blue , firefox in orange because its icon is predominantly orange , opera in red because its icon is red , and chrome in green because why the fuck not ... 
  what i mean is - let 's say the eu agrees for a million economic migrants a year to move here . 
  you 're number 2,327,642 . 
  do you a ) patiently wait your turn , b ) risk coming in the same way people are coming in now ? 
   `` if we do n't open the door to legal migration the unfortunate people of our world will be climbing in through our windows '' . 
  i guess the obvious question is , what makes him think that having legal migration will stop people wanting to climb in through the windows anyway ( assuming that the legal path has any restrictions or quotas at all ) ? 
  i would n't pretend to be an expert on fighter aircraft , but if the analysis offered at https://defenseissues.wordpress.com/2014/01/11/comparing-modern-western-fighters/ is remotely accurate , it 's probably a pretty good buy of what 's available out there ? 
  you do n't think the distance between the uk mainland and the falklands would make it awkward in the first place ? 
  * if * you were going to do it , i think you 'd need to concede a high staffing allowance to have a local rep on each overseas territory , and the mp keeps in touch via phone / email / videoconferencing . 
  just wondered about quorum there ...  rule 168 : quorum  1 . 
  parliament may deliberate , settle its agenda and approve the minutes , whatever the number of members present . 
  a quorum shall exist when one third of the component members of parliament are present in the chamber . 
  all votes shall be valid whatever the number of voters unless the president , on a request made before voting has begun by at least 40 members , establishes at the time of voting that the quorum is not present . 
  if the vote shows that the quorum is not present , the vote shall be placed on the agenda for the next sitting . 
   a request for the quorum to be established must be made by at least 40 members . 
  a request on behalf of a political group is not admissible . 
   when establishing the result of the vote , account must be taken , in accordance with paragraph 2 , of all the members present in the chamber and , in accordance with paragraph 4 , of all the members who asked for the quorum to be established . 
  the electronic voting system can not be used for this purpose . 
  the doors of the chamber may not be closed . 
   if the number of members required to make up the quorum is not present , the president shall not announce the result of the vote but shall declare that the quorum is not present . 
   the last sentence of paragraph 3 shall not apply to votes on procedural motions but only to votes on the subject-matter itself . 
  members who have asked for the quorum to be established shall be counted as being present within the meaning of paragraph 2 , even if they are no longer in the chamber . 
   members who have asked for the quorum to be established must be present in the chamber when the request is made . 
  if fewer than 40 members are present , the president may rule that there is no quorum . 
  so if you need 250 meps to make quorum ( 1/3 of the 751 total ) ... hypothetically , all the non-french meps could agree to stay away bar forty to call for quorum ; the 72 french meps plus 40 quorum callers would be comfortably under the 250 required , and so you could completely paralyse the strasbourg sessions by simply not turning up ? 
  ( and , indeed , could continue discussions and working in brussels such that when the parliament re-convenes there , many things can go straight to vote anyway ) ? 
  * if * they were to get a vote , i imagine you 'd have one mp covering all the overseas territories anyway , so they 'd still be dwarfed by gibraltar . 
  i agree it sounds highly unlikely , and was probably no more than an ( apparently effective ) negotiating tactic with mitterrand . 
  nonetheless , it 's a claim he 's made , and i do n't think we have any evidence he was lying . 
  argentina , of course , complains about the falkland islanders being colonists . 
  ironic when you consider that [ 97 % of argentina 's population ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2075.html#ar ) is , yes , descended from european colonists too . 
  i know this was intended as a joke , but scrapping trident might not yield * any * savings in the short term :  [ the cost of cancelling the nuclear deterrent ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/apr/30/savings-scrapping-trident-negligible-snp ) -- a key snp policy -- might even be more than that of keeping it in the short term , evidence suggests, 
  even if the falkland islanders * did * get a vote , there 're under three thousand of them - they 'd not have a large effect . 
  [ according to the then-french president ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/22/books.france ) ,  `` that thatcher , what an impossible woman ! '', 
  the president said as he arrived , more than 45 minutes late , on may 7 1982 . 
  `` with her four nuclear submarines in the south atlantic , she 's threatening to unleash an atomic weapon against argentina if i do n't provide her with the secret codes that will make the missiles we sold the argentinians deaf and blind . '', 
  he reminded mr magoudi that on may 4 an exocet missile had struck hms sheffield . 
  `` to make matters worse , it was fired from a super-etendard jet , '' he said . 
  `` all the mat\u00e9riel was french ! '', 
  note that the worst-case scenarios outlined here are also the ones that hurt germany the most too . 
  it 's hard to see why germany ( or any other eu nation ) would n't want an outcome that hurt them the least , so the `` 14 % loss '' headline seems a bit needless . 
  aye - if spain made an effort to win over the gibraltarians , to the point that a majority * wanted * to merge with spain , i think it 'd be a lot likelier to happen than the situation now , where spain seems to try to piss gibraltarians off from time to time and ends up with results like :  in a second referendum on sovereignty held in november 2002 by the government of gibraltar , 187 voted yes ( 1 % ) and 17,900 voted no ( 99 % ) on the proposal of sharing sovereignty with spain . 
  in theory , it 's an attempt to have the state pay for the housing that people actually * need * - so if you have a family with one child , who need two bedrooms , then they 'd get a two-bedroom-property 's worth of rent . 
  meaning that if they 're in a three bedroom property , they 'll need to pay the difference themselves . 
  in theory a halfway reasonable idea , in practice it 's been done really poorly , as it 's not taken into account what 's actually available , and has n't taken into account rooms used by equipment / occasional overnights by carers etc for disabled folk . 
   36 to scottish driving instructor , 1995 : `` how do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test ? '' iirc this was in oban ; a friend , who hails from oban originally , observed `` yeah , it 's a fair question ... '', 
  a construction like north macedonia seems entirely sensible - shame it 's apparently off the table . 
  `` handed out '' feels like rather a generous piece of phrasing - my understanding is that karelia was handed over to the russians in the same way that crimea was handed over ... 
  as tempting as it must be to travel to russia and then protest against the russian government ... 
  oddly annoying colour scheme - had they used yellow for ` predominantly bosniak ' , then the ` bosniak-croat mixed ' could 've been green , which would 've neatly been a mix of croat blue and bosniak yellow !, 
   illegal migrants see the uk as a `` soft touch '' and its benefits system acts as a `` magnet '' to them , the mayor of the french city of calais has told mps . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29799733 so probably partly that , and quite possibly partly the fact we speak english , and thanks to the expanse of the british empire in the past , and america 's cultural dominance now , odds are probably good on them speaking some english rather than some french too ? 
  blackberry , who had a long-established presence in the email/messaging side of things , have been more or less wiped out . 
  windows phone , despite being a pretty decent ui these days , and having the marketing budget of microsoft behind it , is struggling to gain market share . 
  so sell this to me - what 's going to help this be anything other than the tiniest of niche products , when there 're so many nice android phones out there from samsung , htc , sony , et at ? 
  brit on a non-metered supply here , so it 's a [ flat annual charge ] ( http://www.scottishwater.co.uk/you-and-your-home/your-charges/2014-2015-charges/2014-2015-unmetered-charges ) which includes water supply as well as drainage/sewers . 
  note that he 's king george v of the united kingdom , rather than simply gb ; his full title at the time was his majesty george v , by the grace of god , of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and of the british dominions beyond the seas , king , defender of the faith , emperor of india . 
  fair enough for eastern europe , but france ? 
  the netherlands ? 
  sweden ? 
  italy ? 
  true , though that might nominally justify conscripting into the royal navy ( which obviously does n't happen any more either ) !,
