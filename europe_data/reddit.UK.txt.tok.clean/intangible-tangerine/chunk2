  132/141 i missed kosovo and moldova and needed second guesses for san marino , belarus and lichtenstein . 
  - got the general region for them all just not the precise location . 
  --------------------------------- it 's only a few big countries that i know by geography alone ; u.k , germany , italy , france , spain , portugal , russia . 
  for the rest i rely on vague knowledge of past empires and past wars . 
  to get to russia the nazis had to march through country a and then b and then c. to get to hungary the mongols marched the other way through ... ' the anglo-saxons were sailed from ... to invade us . 
  to get to the netherlands for operation market garden british planes flew this way ... poland and lithuania used to be married s did czech republic and slovakia and so they must be next to each other and so on . 
  oooooh careful . 
  do n't go saying that austrian and german accents sound the same , wars have been fought over less . 
  because he 's meant to be an austrian who fought for britain in wwii and then stayed . 
  the joke being that despite 30 + years of british citizenship the other civil servants still do n't entirely trust him . 
  over at / r/askhistorians the 20 year rule is used . 
  so her term as prime-minister would count as historical but her lifetime is too recent . 
  the russian military supplied the rebels with anti-aircraft missiles when they knew the rebels did n't have the knowledge to distinguish military planes from civilian planes . 
  if a person gives a monkey a machine gun , that person is then responsible for what the monkey does with the machine gun . 
  all of these questions are answered in the article . 
  through the magic of reading you can find information for yourself !, 
  [ portemeirion , wales ] ( http://www.harlech.com/visitwales/portmeirion.jpg ) you may recognise it as it was the setting for the cult 60s british tv series ` the prisoner ', 
  in bristol dialect ( bristolian ) we have the verb ` to pitch ' for when snow lands on the ground and settles to form a white covering , instead of it melting . 
  the use of the verb ` to pitch ' to mean ` to settle ' is in general english use , as in ` to pitch a tent ' but i believe the use in specific relation to snow is unique to bristol . 
  caribbean patois has `` every mickle mek [ makes ] a muckle '' from scottish influence . 
  ** british english . 
  ** * `` shipshape and bristol fashion '' - said of something that is in good order , well built , neat and tidy etc. 
  ( as a bristolian i approve this absolutely accurate association in our language between things that are built in bristol and things that are done properly . 
  the saying comes from when bristol was the uk 's second port and ships had to be very well built to deal with our high tides , so bristol got a reputation for good shipbuilding and engineering in general . ), 
  * `` fine words butter no parsnips '' - talking about doing something does n't get it done . 
  * `` bugger this for a game of soldiers '' - this task is too difficult/unpleasant/not worth the effort and so i 'm not going to bother finishing it . 
  ( commonly thought to date from wwi ) * `` as the actress said to the bishop '' - the older version of ` that 's what she said ' used to point out when someone has inadvertently uttered what could be taken for sexual innuendo . 
  * `` carry coals to newcastle '' to do something useless ( newcastle was a coal-mining town so they already had plenty of coal . ), 
  * `` it 's all greek to me '' - * from shakespeare * . 
  i ca n't understand this at all . 
  * `` bob 's your uncle '' - emphasising that a task is simple to complete , often used at the end of a set of instructions . 
  roughly equivalent to french `` et voil\u00e0 ! '' . 
  ( often connected to prime minister robert ( bob ) cecil appointing his nephew arthur balfour as foreign secretary , but this is doubtful as the expression is n't coined until a few decades later . ), 
  * `` all mouth and no trousers '' - used about a person who 's good at talk but not at action . 
  * `` mad as a box of frogs '' - totally insane . 
  * `` pop one 's clogs '' ( he popped his clogs ) - to die ( he died ) * `` take the piss '' - to mock , to lie blatantly or to take unwarranted liberties . 
  we have peanut butter 2 . 
  it 's better than yours , it 's more peanutty . 
  hazelnut is not an additive in nutella , it 's a core ingredient . 
  it was invented in wwii as a substitute for chocolate when cocoa supplies were low and so they used hazelnuts as they were plentiful . 
  compared to what greece and spain have gone though our austerity has been very mild . 
  `` why do you have such an aversion to foreigners ? '', 
  you 've used the racist term ` mongoloid ' in this very thread and you 're accusing the maltese of being xenophobic ?!, 
  wow . 
  not very self-aware are you ? 
  maybe you had a bad experience in malta because they sensed you 're not a nice person . 
  just a thought . 
  malta the island is not the same thing as malta the country , which includes other islands as well . 
  ` on malta ' would just be referring to the island of malta , ` in malta ' refers to the country of malta which includes the whole maltese archipelago . 
  what 's the general maltese public opinion on the history of the british empire in malta and malta 's membership of the commonwealth ? 
  what is your personal opinion of the same ? 
  39 people is not an insignificant number . 
  you are talking about your own citizens executed by the orders of civilian courts . 
  it does n't matter if it was just one person . 
  so long as the us has capital punishment every dictator and tyrant in the world can just point at you and they can say ` well they do it ' people in dictatorships have limited choices , that 's the nature of the beast , but you live in a democracy where you do get to decide whether to keep capital punishment , so yeah , you are more responsible for it than someone living in iran or china . 
  i learned yesterday ( from horrible histories ) that during wwi british intelligence used girl guides to transfer secret messages , after finding that the boy scouts could not be trusted to be reliable and discrete . 
  so , i would suggest that it 's not the boy scouts the russians need to be worried about . 
  you 're not meant to eat fish and chips on it 's own , either you eat it on the beach with an ice-cream accompaniment or in the pub with a pint to hand or at home with a nice pint of tea . 
  mushy peas only taste nice if they 're served within 5 seconds of being soaked and then mushed , otherwise they 're rank . 
  tinned mushy peas are the devil 's own vomit . 
  it 's in the caucuses on the border between europe and asia , hence why it 's also in the european song contest . 
  pasta + noodles in fact . 
  the germans use the same word for both ( die nudeln ) proving that they are in fact the same species . 
  i 'm not aware of any casting agencies putting up ads with ` wanted , skinny people with ugly faces ' the whole package is what sells the clothes . 
  it really is !, 
  it was very tricky to whittle the list down to 7 , i 've tried to include a good mix of ancient and modern , southern and northern , natural and man-made sites . 
  i read elsewhere on reddit this week that estonia has the most international fashion models per capita of any county in the world . 
  so i guess ` reflections of 7 super good looking people as seen in the ice of our frozen lakes ' or something like that would be doable . 
  ** 7 wonders of england . 
  [ canterbury cathedral ] ( http://www.paradoxplace.com/photo%20pages/uk/britain_south_and_west/canterbury_cathedral/canterbury_external/images/900/ccathedral-jul07-nd0420sar9.jpg ) initially founded by st augustine of canterbury in the 6th c. ad , although largely rebuilt and expanded by the normans after a fire in the 12th c . it is a unesco world heritage site and is one of the oldest purpose built christian structures in england . 
  [ the eden project , cornwall ] ( http://www.cornishcottagesonline.com/dynimg_area_large/eden_project_cornwall~82~68.jpg ) giant , geodesic , climate controlled biomes set in an old clay mining quarry , housing myriad botanical gardens , art works and performance events . 
  [ the clifton suspension bridge , bristol ] ( http://www.zzzone.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/clifton-suspension-8718.jpg ) spanning the avon gorge which itself is a designated biological and geological site of special scientific interest under eu law ( it has species found no where else ) , the bridge was famously designed by isambard kingdom brunel and was completed after his death in 1864 . 
  it has a grade 1 listing from english heritage . 
  [ stonehenge , wiltshire ] ( http://celticmythpodshow.com/resources/galleries/stonehenge/orig/stonehenge%20rainbow%20by%20lulup.jpg ) undoubtedly one of the most famous neolithic and bronze age sites in both england and the world and listed along with the neighbouring avebury henge as a unesco world heritage site . 
  its mysterious origins have led to many myths and legends being attached to it over the centuries . 
  [ yorkshire dales national park ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3212/3009784787_659fe32d46.jpg ) comprising 680 square miles of undulating hills and river valleys ( dales ) in yorkshire and cumbria , it epitomises the ` green and pleasant land ' idyll of the english countryside . 
  the area is also renowned for its characteristic stone built buildings . 
  [ hadrian 's wall , cumbria ] ( http://www.peterloud.co.uk/photos/othersuk/hadrians_wall/734_milecastle_39_w750.jpg ) another unesco world heritage site , the wall was originally built to mark the northern frontier of the roman empire in the 2nd c. ad . 
  it now lies fully within england , the scottish border having moved some distance north . 
  [ the ruins of tintagel castle ] ( http://ih2.redbubble.net/image.9122144.7775/flat,550x550,075,f.u1.jpg ) a medieval fortress built upon cornwall 's tintagel peninsula , it has been mythologised as the birth place of the legendary king arthur since geoffrey of monmouth 's ` historia regum britanniae ' ( history of the kings of britain ) was written in the 12th c. ----------------------------------- london deserves it 's own list , so i 've not included london sites here . 
  scotland , wales and northern ireland also deserve their own lists . 
  / / old buildings do n't really make for a great skyline anyway / / / u wot m8 ? 
  you think [ old buildings ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lfxhczctbhu/uvgzgxalq5i/aaaaaaaafvy/xi4qshw8_aa/s1600/pyramids.jpg ) do n't make for great skylines ? 
  you plonker . 
  the flag is n't the isis flag , this is the isis [ flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/flag_of_the_islamic_state_in_iraq_and_the_levant.svg/1280px-flag_of_the_islamic_state_in_iraq_and_the_levant.svg.png ) there are lots of jihadi groups in the world and some of them are currently in conflict with isis , so to call every jihadi flag an isis flag is stupid . 
  isis did not invent islamic militancy , however much they want to pretend they did . 
  they 're just al-quada copycats . 
  accusations of bias against them usually will focus in on one news bulletin or one article . 
  ` this interview with an israeli solider is pro-israeli ! ', 
  the real litmus test is whether they have proportionate balance when you take their output as whole , over a certain period of time ( dependent on context ) . 
  it 's amazing how people who want to see bias are so skilled at picking out the specific radio interview or on-line article or tv news headline which specifically supports their accusation and manage to ignore everything else that bbc news broadcast or published that day/week/month ... 
  the toilet walls of the apple , the canteen , the crown etc. 
  location : the west country , ( part of the uk ) what they say ` shawn is a cheater and he has a small penis ' it 's usually accurate and presumably timely advice for someone . 
  other than that , uk wide - bbc 's flagship news on radio 4 and the world service . 
  the bbc tv and internet news can be a bit editorialised to grab attention as they need to be competitive , but 4 and ws radio news is meant for adults and they will happily have hours long programs on arcane subjects like the minutiae of european tax law reforms . 
  i would also rate reuters very high as a news gathering source , along with the bbc , but they do n't have a high direct audience , most of their news is filtered through other outlets who often put their own spin on it and water down the truthiness . 
  an area where the uk media tends to fall short across the board is in science reporting . 
  even outlets with good science reporting in their special science sections - such as the bbc and the guardian - are let down by things like false balance , regurgitated press releases , presuming an expert in one area has expertise in an unrelated area etc. 
  when science stories appear elsewhere in their output . 
  for asylum claims we have a policy of prioritising the people who are mostly likely to face life-endangering discrimination if they try to settle near their home country .
