   for instance they 'll go on about how the eu has made it possible for criminals to vote , but when actually explained why is it against basic human rights to deny voting to someone because he broke the law well clearly somebody has n't explained it right to me then . 
  i fail to see how human rights encompass anything beyond a right to a fair trial , a right to humane treatment and a right to speak freely . 
  i 'm sick of people using `` human rights '' to push touchy-feely nonsense that should be debated openly , not under the guise of `` you ca n't oppose this because then you oppose human rights '' . 
   also , i have n't met a single ukip supporter that made any sense about anything . 
  i honestly can not understand how such a party has come to get so much support . 
  their views , and pardon the reference , remind me of the early nazi party when they blamed it all on the jews . 
  oh just fuck off . 
  it 's an insult to the memory of the nazi 's victims to wilfully misrepresent history like that . 
  ukip are essentially a splinter group of the tories , a mainstream party that 's been in power in britain for a fair part of the last two centuries . 
  they did n't come out of nowhere like the nazis did , they came into existence because all the major parties in the uk refuse to address the fact people do n't like being part of the eu and especially do n't like being told `` shut up , it 's not your place to decide your future '' particularly when there 's a decent chance a republic of europe will arise in this century . 
  ukip do n't want to violently overthrow the government , they oppose foreign wars and they * definitely * do n't want to open extermination camps , for the love of fuck do n't dilute the memory of the nazi menace by comparing it to ukip . 
  we have enough nut jobs thank you very much !, 
  that 'd be decent here as well , our commuter trains would be illegal to transport cattle on . 
  ** federalise the uk ** our current constitutional status is abysmal . 
  it 's unfair , unworkable and manages to breed nationalism that further destabilises the country . 
  the only solution is a full federal constitution in which each of the four constituent countries can control their own affairs while westminster deals with the issues that affect all of us like defence , foreign affairs and the justice system . 
  ** hold a binding referendum on our eu membership ** regardless of your stance on the eu the current situation is a complete * diktat * , nobody ever voted for a political union or a superstate which is exactly the direction the eu is heading in . 
  a fair referendum would put the issue to bed for a generation , either ( as i 'm sure most in this sub would want ) we continue in the eu with the democratic consent of the people or we leave and get on with our lives . 
  either way it should be for the people to decide , especially if the future is a republic of europe . 
  yeah , i think filling the house of lords with another set of career politicians is just begging for gridlock and inefficiency . 
  in my opinion it should be filled with people who are experts in their fields , for example there should be some scientists there to scrutinise climate policy , doctors to scrutinise nhs policy and so on . 
  more politicians will only make things worse . 
  it 's never been as important as it is for some people because of how our government works . 
  the pm is an ordinary mp who represents a constituency , it 's not fair for him ( or her ) to be barred from voting because then that constituency does n't get represented . 
  they would have worked as a nation but probably not as well as they do currently . 
  alex salmond could have taught ukip how to wave away any real discussion about policy details . 
  poland had a bear enlisted as a private during ww2 . 
  russians are slavs . 
  that regime has an abysmal human rights and quality of life record , i 'm very glad to live in europe over china . 
  it 's a shame ukip probably are doing a bit of that because some of their policies are really good . 
  they 're huge fans of direct democracy , one policy is a mechanism that triggers a referendum on a piece of legislation if a certain percentage of the electorate objects to it which would be an excellent compromise between democracy and efficiency . 
  this would work locally as well as nationally , this would prevent horrific misuse of government power like that time a welsh village was flooded to make room for a reservoir for an english city . 
  i think the current situation with the eu is a complete * diktat * , there was never a referendum on political union . 
  if we have the referendum and it passes we get to leave and get on with our lives , if it does n't then we can continue with the eu project with the democratic support of the people . 
  unfortunately nobody in the tories or labour have the balls to give us one and the liberal democrats wo n't for ideological reasons ( which is sad , locally they 're excellent ) . 
  apparently christianity is on the rise in areas with high numbers of muslim immigrants . 
  that 's a bit like saying `` ireland is british in the sense it is part of the british isles '' , it 's technically true but it will piss people off . 
  i 've never really understood why `` populist '' is such a term of disparagement , it means `` policies that appeal to the common people rather than the elites '' , is n't that a good thing ? 
  is n't that exactly what the people want ? 
  that 's not strictly true though , ukip were absolutely minute a few years ago and now they 're polling at around 25 % . 
  but they were n't exactly traditionalists or conservatives either , they were responsible for some horrific acts of vandalism against [ cathedrals ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cathedral_of_christ_the_saviour#demolition ) . 
  i 'd support any action that brings these islands closer together , things like the common travel area are mutually beneficial . 
  an anglesey-dublin tunnel would be pretty decent as well !, 
  we still have the falklands , a few nice ~ ~ tax havens ~ ~ holiday islands and an imperial fuck-ton of penguins . 
  i approve of england 's northern border . 
  \\  nobody likes the english \\  the uk has the most `` soft power '' of all the countries in the world including america . 
  u wot ? 
  except chernobyl was a disaster waiting to happen with chronic mismanagement and poor reactor design while fukushima was built on a fault line in a tsunami prone region using several generations old technology and still did n't cause anything approaching the destruction of chernobyl . 
  britain is , england has a land border with scotland and wales ... 
  i 'm completely in favour of tidal power because it 's extremely predictable and far less of a blot on the landscape than wind farms but there 'd be serious problems sticking tidal arrays in the busiest shipping lanes in the world . 
  i really hope those difficulties can be overcome though . 
  while he 's mostly talking out of his arse it is true irish citizens are n't treated as foreigners under british law . 
  albion and hibernia are much nicer names anyway . 
  ca n't we just say `` britain and ireland '' and stop getting our collective knickers in a twist ? 
  surely there 's nothing political in that title ? 
  albion and hibernia ? 
  and people still wonder why even the pro-eu campaigners reject britain adopting the euro . 
  the spanish government properly fucked up the catalonia situation . 
  the right way to go about it would be to hold a referendum , the better together campaign was a bit shit in scotland compared to the yes scotland campaign but the electorate still voted comfortably against secession which certainly would n't have happened if westminster had spend the last decade telling scotland it did n't have the right to self-determination . 
  people generally do n't like uncertainty and change unless it 's completely necessary . 
  i 've been to the '94 olympic ski resorts in lillehammer , really cool place and the drive up from oslo is brilliant !, 
   criminal acts you 've just argued * my * case . 
  if a government sanctions it then by definition it is not a criminal act . 
  unless you 're talking about international law in which case i invite you to show me with full references where britain has violated it . 
  [ such horror ] ( http://foundtheworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sydney-australia-6.jpg ) , [ very oppress ] ( http://www.paragonrelocation.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/canada-vancouver-relocation-company-cost-of-living.jpg ) . 
  [ much misery ] ( http://beta.images.theglobeandmail.com/archive/01278/nw-oecd24_1278456a.jpg ) . 
  before the british empire cannibalism , forced marriage and the ritual burning of wives after their husbands died was rife in some parts of the world . 
  while it has a lot of blood to it 's name it 's not as black and white as people like you would have us believe . 
  britain invented industrialisation , but of course a life of hardship and misery in an agrarian world would be better than an industrial one with the big bad british in it ... 
  governments ca n't be terrorists though , the definition of terrorism is :  the unofficial or unauthorized use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims . 
  the very fact the government sanctions it makes it not terrorism . 
  there are lots of words to describe the conduct of the government , terrorists is n't one of them . 
  i wish hysterical people like you would stop misusing the word because it only makes it easier for people to spread nonsense . 
  words have meanings . 
  just because they 're cowards as well as traitors does n't mean we should welcome them back to europe by any means . 
  russia is alright , it 's just the leaders that are sketchy as fuck . 
  lets fight percived bigotry with more bigtory !, 
  i 'm not surprised !, 
  loved the drive up from oslo as well , the countryside between oslo and lillehammer is amazing . 
  how norwegians drive around with eight inches of snow on the road without 4x4s is baffling though , i was terrified for my life !, 
  no , it looks possible that a new party might hold the balance of power in a system specifically designed to produce stable majority governments . 
  not all of it , just the parts outside hong kong island . 
  and the uk is infamous for breaking international agreements , why not break one that will directly lead to the systematic oppression of a whole country if carried out ? 
  the city of london is weird , it 's only a square mile in one of the world 's most important cities and it has it 's own system of governance ( including it 's own police force ) unbroken since saxon times . 
  it 's good motivation , imagine how fast 3d tv could have taken off if 3d pornography was a thing ... 
  damn , an uncultured yank with a concept of banter ? 
  we should study this specimen in more detail !, 
  [ allow me to explain ] ( http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103530/2386293-the_joke_your_head_3-%28n1292804669453%29.jpg ) . 
  til wales is in london . 
  norway is an amazing country , i 'd love to take a whole year out there or something . 
  i 've snowboarded at kvitfjell and hafjell where they had the 1994 olympics , they 're really cool places . 
  you can see a man with the olympic torch cut into the woods on one of the mountains at hafjell . 
  what a bunch of entitled cunts . 
  that 's good news i suppose , as long as it 's implemented in a way that 's open to scrutiny like truecrypt was . 
  it 'd be politically unacceptable , if you want an idea of how much the electorate dislikes the eu there 's a forth political party dedicated to the issue emerging * in a first past the post system * , something that people would have laughed at you for predicting ten years ago . 
  you 're right that we have dna from a lot of races floating around but recent genetic studies show that surprisingly the whole island of great britain owes a lot of it 's genetics not to the anglo-saxons , norse , romans or even the celts , there was a palaeolithic race living here that makes up a huge chunk of our gene pool . 
  i find it really interesting that there 's barely any ethnic difference between the english , scottish and irish and the national myth of england 's origin ( germanic settlers wiping out the previous celtic people ) being provably false . 
  obviously this does n't make / u/steca any less of a bigoted twat , i just think the whole `` melting pot '' description of britain is a bit more subtle . 
  exactly , if the eu is to have nearly as much clout as we 're promised it needs a common foreign policy . 
  unfortunately that does n't seem compatible with the uk 's continued membership .
