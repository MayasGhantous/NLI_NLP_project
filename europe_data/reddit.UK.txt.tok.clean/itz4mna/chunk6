  yeah , the eu does n't have it 's own foreign policy . 
  as someone from the uk i 'm ashamed of my government for stabbing hong kong in the back , we granted all our other colonies independence but hong kong was handed over to a far , far worse colonial master . 
  we should have held a referendum like we did in our current overseas territories on continuing british rule or independence , instead we just signed them away to a brutal pseudo-communist dictatorial regime with no regard for human rights . 
  or call anybody from the south east a londoner . 
  we dislike london as much as the rest of the country but still get the blame for everything !, 
  it even varies throughout the uk , air rifles are legal in england ( though you need a licence for one with an energy of over 12 foot-pounds ) but the scots are/were trying to ban them at one point . 
  wo n't that become false when quantum computing is developed though ? 
  does that mean we can piss off yanks with `` do you mean proper football or incorrect rugby with body armour and advert breaks ? '', 
  dunno what it 's like in wales but i 've bought a fair few things in ounces . 
  7oz tinned sweets come to mind as well as fresh fruit . 
  i suggest you move to china and start a family there , see how much of a hard on you have for totalitarian government after that . 
  europe certainly does n't need people like you trying to encourage state sponsored brutality . 
  when it 's your wife being forced to have an abortion against her will , being fined into bankruptcy because your contraception failed or having your child abandoned or even murdered to avoid the all-powerful party then maybe you 'll realise what a disgusting argument you 're making . 
  we 're pretty flexible , you can order a lot of things in either system , there 's a lot of `` soft conversion '' as well , lots of jars say 454g on them which seems a weird number until you realise it 's just a pound by a different name . 
  as far as roads are concerned a yard is a metre and a mile is 1600 metres these days since the planners design them in round metric units . 
  the real conversions are something like 1 yard = 0.91 metres and 1 mile = 1.61 kilometres so it 's within 10 % tolerance . 
  edit : why the bloody hell are people downvoting me for simply stating facts about how things are run in the uk ? 
  you 're right about si being the only permitted system under eu law but we have a few opt-outs ( mostly because continental roads have been in kilometres for centuries and we 'd have to pay an unrealistic amount to convert ours ) . 
  our roads are imperial-only by law except widths/heights which must be in feet and inches but are allowed to have an equivalent in metres as well , some of our legislation is imperial ( three inches is the longest knife you can have on you in public without a good reason ) and you can only buy beer by the pint in a pub . 
  there 's also lots of non-legal things still in imperial , pressure is more often than not quoted in psi rather than kpa and it 's more common in a lot of places to hear something is `` 30 feet away '' rather than `` 9 metres away '' . 
  kilogrammes/grammes are quite a bit more common than stone/pounds/ounces but they 're still in use . 
  we 've used base-60 for time , angles and geographical co-ordinates since the babylonians and still do because the architects of the metric system ran into all sorts of problems decimalising them . 
  why not go the other way ? 
  60 is divisible by more numbers than ten which makes the mental maths more convenient . 
  i agree with you and the people downvoting you are being cunts because they do n't like your different opinion . 
  as long as both systems are still in use it makes sense to teach both . 
  roads are a pretty important part of virtually everyone 's life ... 
  to be fair the imperial gallon is defined such that one imperial gallon of water weighs exactly ten pounds ( at 62f and an ambient pressure of 30 inhg ) and a fluid ounce of water weighs an ounce . 
  it 's the americans making a pigs ear of things with their weird system again . 
  if we 're going for usability i think a base-60 measurement system would be better because it fits in nicely with our time and geographical co-ordinate system . 
  the nautical mile could be the base unit , it 's a far better geographical measurement than either the statute mile or the kilometre because conveniently it 's a minute of arc across the earth and a base-60 weight system would have nicer factors than our current base-10 one . 
  if you can work with hours , minutes and seconds you can work with a base-60 metric system . 
  in a country where imperial measurements are still widely used and sometimes the * only * legal measure then it 's a sensible policy . 
  the is no point in teaching in kilometres only when metricating our roads has been off the table for a good few years . 
  i suppose you think [ this ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1506469.stm ) is acceptable collateral damage ? 
  overpopulation is the least of our worries , europe has an aging population . 
  unless you want hundreds of millions of people emigrating from the third world ( where the population is rapidly increasing ) then emulating china would be a disaster . 
  international law applies when it suits the country involved , if we followed it to the letter we 'd be at war with russia by now . 
  what , by behaving like an orwellian hellhole ? 
  i suppose torture is acceptable to you as well if it yields results ? 
  a one child policy in a society that favours male babies is a humanitarian crisis waiting to happen . 
  actually for an evil colonial oppressor the uk was very generous to hong kong , it could run it 's own affairs while britain defended it from the nasty communist regime over the border . 
  i think the british overseas territories should get representation in the house of commons as well , they make up a third of a million of our citizens and barely have a voice , i think the only one most people can name is the falkland islands and that 's because we went to war over it . 
  imagine if we 'd had a similar arrangement with the dominions like australia and canada in the early 20th century , an imperial federation of equal nations would be a force to be reckoned with . 
  they 're an autonomous city-state at the moment but they 're going to be fully absorbed into a country that has some horrific practices such as murdering and torturing it 's citizens , pissing over reproductive rights ( just look at that disgusting one-child policy ) and censoring anything critical of their nasty regime . 
  i think we completely stabbed hong kong in the back , we should have held at least held a referendum so the people who live there could have decided their own future . 
  the other colonies were granted their independence but hong kong was just handed over from one colonial master to a much worse one . 
  hmm , hong kong would rather be ruled by a democratic first world country that let them run virtually all their own affairs than a malevolent pseudo-communist dictatorship that 'll absorb it fully in 2047 ? 
  colour me shocked . 
  what ? 
  geographically serbia is definitely european . 
  europe is bounded by the ural mountains in the east and the bosporus in the south . 
  why britain specifically ? 
  is it because english is the lingua franca or we still have quite a reliable welfare state ? 
  it 's a really nice country with decent people but if you read half the stuff in our national and international media you 'd think we were a bunch of rabid xenophobes . 
  in reality nobody cares where you 're from as long as you 're not a a massive twat but that 's not the impression our media gives . 
  i consider myself a quiet british patriot but that does n't stop me considering the flaws in the way my country is run , makes them seem worse if anything . 
  there 's a difference between the xenophobic nationalism of the bnp and the kind of patriotism that 's more along the lines of `` the uk is a great country and we should work to keep it a place to be proud of '' . 
  singapore airlines do wifi on some flights , did n't work with my moto g though . 
  virgin in australia do as well but they charge you up the arse for it . 
  the height of luxury for me was getting an empty seat next to me on a connecting flight from singapore ... 
  not being mindlessly patriotic here , our plugs are objectively a better design than the europlug . 
  ours are designed to reject a plug with no ground pin , if you tear the wire out by accident the live wire disconnects first and they stay in the wall a lot better . 
  also having the fuse in the plug rather than the socket and having the wire point down rather than out is an advantage as well . 
  the most ironic thing is that both civilisations are abrahamic , christians and muslims worship the same god by a different name . 
  not going to deny there 's a lot of nasty stuff in the koran , it 's got stuff that trumps even the old testament in terms of unpleasantness but we have to remember this is the culture that preserved the knowledge of antiquity while we had our dark age in europe . 
  the problem is obviously related to islam but it 's not as simple as `` islam is an violent doctrine '' , i think it 's more to do with extremist death cults that have been named elsewhere in this thread perverting it for political means . 
  a stated goal of these terrorist movements is to get the west to turn against islam as a whole to stir up even more conflict , we 'd be playing right into their hands to treat it as a black and white `` islam vs the west '' issue . 
  we can make this problem go away by focusing on the things that unite us and not the things that divide us which means a switch from multiculturalism to integrationism , somebody who is british/european first and muslim second is no terrorist threat . 
  terrorists recognise this and are keen to make us seem like we hate muslims . 
  i agree that people who carry out attacks and recruit for extremists should be tried for treason and dealt with extremely severely , nobody is seriously disputing that but we 're approaching it like there 's lines of jihadi soldiers ready made and queuing up to fight in syria . 
  what i suggest is that we should recognise the fact that jihadist recruits are `` brainwashed '' in a cult-like fashion , if we can `` deprogram '' their recruits before they can actually betray their country then we should make every effort to do so . 
  you 're deliberately missing the point . 
  discrimination comes in many forms , not just racial . 
  if it 's such a minor inconvenience how about you try supporting 9k a year on a student budget while the snp laugh all the way to the bank ? 
  as far as british precedent is concerned we decided the westboro baptist church are n't a legitimate christian group and banned them from the country . 
  i guess it 's a personal opinion but i see it as when a group perverts a religion for selfish ends ( isis is n't about establishing a caliphate , it 's about who gets to rule syria and iraq ) it 's no longer a religious organisation . 
   and i 'm saying that its reasonable to differentiate because ** white ** students are n't likely to flock to scotland whereas ** african ** students are . 
  nice job defending discrimination , just because we share a skin colour does n't make this any less obnoxious . 
  we should approach the extremists in europe like we 'd approach a death cult ( which is exactly what they are ) : arrest the leaders for inciting violence and religious hatred , shut down the establishments they preach in and offer exit counselling to all the people affected by their vile doctrine . 
  they are n't representatives of islam , they are a despicable sect like heaven 's gate or the people 's temple and we should treat them as such . 
  it 's not that they charge english students , it 's that they let foreign students study for free * while also charging english students . 
  i know , it 's a complete crock of shit . 
  it 's just rubbing salt in the wound caused by the lib dem 's shameful failure to stop the raise in tuition fees . 
  charging english but not eu students is part of the reason the rest of the uk is starting to resent the scottish government , a lot of what i heard in england after the referendum was words to the effect of `` great , scotland have voted to support the union , now can * we * have a referendum on kicking them out ? '' . 
  add that to the barely concealed anglophobia of the snp and we might be on our way to seeing a rise in english nationalism as a response . 
  by all means charge english students but at least be consistent and charge french , spanish , italian , polish , german , czech and every other non-scottish resident . 
  anything else is straight up discrimination . 
  i do n't really know anything about spanish history but is there a reason for being so protective over territorial integrity ? 
  i think the reason the scottish independence question was handled so well is because we learned from the absolute clusterfuck that was our approach to ireland a century ago . 
  how is it a human rights violation being spied on in a place where there 's no expectation of privacy ? 
  i agree it 's an orwellian measure they should n't have done but even before this you 'd have had to have been a bit thick to think they * were n't * spying on the internet when there 's hives of jihadi shite and neo-nazi rubbish just a few clicks away . 
  the spanish government has really made a pigs ear of this , we did the democratic thing and had the debates , campaigns and a referendum and now a 300 year old marriage of convenience has been affirmed by the people and we 're even getting a proper constitutional reform which will benefit everyone . 
  all they 're going to do is piss everybody off and cause a unilateral declaration of independence which will be messy as hell . 
  i think a lot of british people would support greater london 's independence as long as it took westminster with it ... 
  yeah , that would make sense . 
  and you 're right about northern ireland , the best we could do is annex the rest of ulster !, 
  ( i 'm joking of course but the border would look much nicer ... ), 
  it really depends on how many regions we 're after , if we 're going for more localised governance with lots of regions ( which is what i 'd be in favour of ) then perhaps give the larger cities a `` greater * x * '' area like london has ? 
  cumbria itself might make a viable region under this model but if we 're going for five or six regions like the current idea it becomes far more difficult .
