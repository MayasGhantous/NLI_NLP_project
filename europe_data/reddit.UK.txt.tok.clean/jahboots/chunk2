  i can imagine some kind of federation of ireland , rather than full-on union . 
  ireland is much wealthier than ni and does not have the sectarian problems . 
   what 's wrong with that ? 
  are we supposed to all be russophobes ? 
  russian banks generously help pay her party 's bills . 
   it was people bitching on twitter and dismissed by the mayor as the joke it was , the non-cornish/yorkshire movements in england are bullshit but there is no london independence movement . 
  certainly , the independence for london thing was largely a temporary response to the referendum result , but at least it was an actual phenomena . 
  and london city used to be separate from the rest of england and still has some independence from the crown . 
  whereas most of the other england independence movements on the map are pure fiction . 
  the very famous independence for mercia , wessex , northumberland and generic north-west england movements . 
  / s but , apparently , negligible independent london movement , [ which is a real thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_independence ) , acknowledged by the mayor of london and received media coverage in the past 12 months , after a petition received 180k signatures after the eu referendum result . 
  you 've tried to defame the woman by posting links to pages about crimes , where she 's not even mentioned and then tried to associate her by saying she either knew or worked for someone who was involved . 
  you 're a waste of time . 
  i was wondering how a putin devotee could get an angle on this woman . 
  it seems no one can not be slandered . 
  russia has only had a few years ( 90 's ) experience of a pluralistic system and that was a time of chaos - due to big post-soviet issues . 
  perhaps russia is a country that experiences a cycle of authoritarianism  crash  relative freedom ( and chaos )  authoritarianism  crash ... for some time to come . 
  putin has removed all opposition . 
  combined with the govts domination of domestic media , there 's currently no alternative to his rule . 
  nope . 
  regards brexit : trouble could start when people start to feel the cost . 
  but , brexit is no revolution , more a glib two-fingers to an imagined ` other ' / ` them ' . 
  because all other means of change have been eliminated .

   lukashenko is throwing a fit he 's leveraging belarus ' usp , that they sit between russia and the eu . 
  of course the eu will not admit belarus . 
  i work in the uk online retail sector . 
  i sometimes get calls from companies touting services based in belarus , using their free-trade zone status with russia , to provide a low-tax option for online sales into russia . 
  so , i think they 're leveraging their situation with russia in various ways . 
  ukraine 's decision to turn down russia 's loan/business offers led to the annexation of crimea and the invasion of the east of their country , let 's see what happens with belarus .

  at least for now , the old model of left and right seems outdated . 
  modern politics now seems more about open vs closed ; liberal vs illiberal . 
  for example : at least here in the uk , the labour party are supporting brexit . 
  only the liberal democrats and some smaller parties oppose . 
  agreed . 
  he and a large percentage of his supporters are seeking a kind of left-wing political purity and they 're happy to exchange that purity for a chance at power .

  besides , despite being very difficult , learning another language is a very worthwhile achievement and is something alot of foreigners do as a matter of course . 
  i 'm learning german . 
  i 'll be available for work from april . 
  in the uk i was a self-employed , i hope to do the same here . 
  i hope that will help me with any future visa application i need to do . 
  thank you for the reply . 
  it 's very valuable for me to hear the views of a politician from another country , looking at what britain is doing . 
  i voted remain . 
  when the result came in i planned a move to germany . 
  i have been in berlin for 3 months and am trying to secure a life here . 
  i do n't think the expectation of those that voted leave can be satisfied , so i 'm very concerned about what will happen to the uk over the next 20 years . 
  it appears the uk will set itself up as a tax haven for corporations , with the potential of reducing workers rights . 
   i imagine that is the main reason they see immigration as a problem , rather than racism for racism 's sake . 
  i do n't think it 's racism . 
  it 's more complex than that . 
  it 's why england ( and wales ) voted leave and scotland , london and n.ireland did not . 
  yet they all experience the same income inequalities as the areas that voted leave . 
  to reply to your comment , i 'd just be regurgitating the article and it 's findings . 
  if there 's contradictory data , it would be interesting to see . 
  i 'm not aware of any well established link that 's come up in the surveys . 
  [ a summary of the associated demographic and polling data for brexit & trump voters ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/trump-and-brexit-why-its-again-not-the-economy-stupid/ ) . 
  in the uk , the single biggest reasons people voted for brexit were immigration and national sovereignty . 
  theresa may has implied the uk is heading for a hard brexit . 
  what does the future hold for the uk outside of the eu , eea and european customs union ? 
  a recent poll showed [ 90 % of brits want to retain access to the single market ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/16/uk-voters-want-single-market-access-and-immigration-controls-poll-finds ) . 
  it 'll all end in tears . 
  this article rang very true for me . 
  after the scottish referendum there were more intense calls for an english parliament , which cameron suggested would happen , along with greater powers for scotland . 
  the referendum data does suggest the result was an english nationalist vote ( mostly ) . 
  the uk printed press is struggling for financial survival . 
  appears some publications have dropped standards as they become more desperate .

  it was a non-binding referendum . 
  it did n't give the uk govt the power to leave any major eu agreements . 
  in fact a recent uk court case ruled that parliament must vote on article 50 . 
  the uk has a parliamentary system . 
  the terms were laid out in the referendum . 
  this exchange is over . 
  there 's no meme . 
  you are factually incorrect . 
  the terms of the referendum were laid out in the referendum , they were not set by the rhetoric of the 2 campaigns . 
  it looks like we are leaving the eec & customs union as we will not get control of immigration if we do no do that - that is a decision that will be taken by the uk government and was outside of the referendum 's scope . 
   that simply is n't true . 
  vote leave consistently said on many occasions leaving the eu means leaving the common market . 
  i voted leave on this basis . 
  not only is what you 've said not true , it 's impossible . 
  the brexiters are n't in sufficient positions of power to be able to enact their interpretations of brexit . 
  and within the brexit camp , there were various views as to what brexit would mean . 
  the terms of the referendum were set by the uk governemnt . 
  the question was :  should the united kingdom remain a member of the european union or leave the european union ? 
  the uk government has since taken a position on uk 's membership of the eec , customs union and some other agreements . 
  you are applying a level of detail that was missing from the general referendum debate . 
  membership of the eea and the customs union were barely mentioned . 
   getting a totally different story to every leaver i 've spoken to and every debate i 've seen on tv ( question time etc ) . 
  leavers generally voted to leave everything . 
  most of the leavers i know voted to just leave , they were not interested in details .
