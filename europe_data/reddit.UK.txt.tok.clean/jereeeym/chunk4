  because it happened nearly 100 years ago , seems weird that irish people still harp on about it online , especially as they were n't alive during that time, 
   why do we refer to retirees who move to a country to neither work nor with any intent of returning as ex-pats then ? 
  because they 'll be back home in a coffin in a few years ? 
  well english is a native language in sa, 
  funnily enough this particular force , the wiltshire police , is ranked as the worst police force in the country for dealing with burglaries maybe rather than arresting twitter shitposters you should arrest some actual criminals,

  lol i 've commented there once , i 'm a fucking social democrat for fucks sake , i just do n't like this terrible religion also good job refuting literally nothing that i said, 
  i 've got word from reliable sources that the attacks were radical zoroastrians, 
  wo n't end well as maajid nawaz says , it ends up being thought crime punishment when the suspected jihadist has n't actually broken any laws, 
  personally i vote for [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/pentagram4.svg/220px-pentagram4.svg.png ), 
  the people seem to be progressive given the very large vote in favour of same sex marriage i 've heard however that the politicians are quite conservative and out of line with peoples views, 
   he did n't win the popular vote . 
  that 's becoming rather [ common ] ( https://www.askideas.com/media/48/donald-trump-making-funny-face-picture.jpg ) in politics,

  to be fair some of the best and most important cartoons historically had labelling in my history course literally every cartoon we wrote about was labelled considerably ( not to ben garrison levels though ), 
   the institutionally racist tory party . 
  `` what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence '' and `` radical ethnic rights '' does n't cover saying `` white people love to play divide and rule '' if some tory mp had made a sweeping statement similar to that but about black people then it would be unequivocally racist,

   stop calling it the roman empire . 
  never thought i 'd see someone would get offended about a nearly thousand year old empire, 
  turkroaches get out reeeeeeeeeeeee, 
  this is gon na be super fucking arbitrary but i 'll give it a go they must : a ) not want strict sharia b ) accept secular laws c ) speak the language fluently ( having mandatory language lessons for incoming immigrants ) there are also things you can do to encourage integration such as : 1 ) spread out the population of immigrants to avoid them forming enclaves where they do n't integrate [ such as this one in germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cyfp4ev_za ) 2 ) taking immigrants from areas that are more culturaly similar , which will reduce the need to integrate in the first place, 
   i 'd rather be allies with iran than saudi arabia . 
  as much as i agree with this it really is a `` cancer or hiv '' type question do you want the country that [ hangs gays ] ( http://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/iran-executes-gay-teenager-in-violation-of-international-law-463234 ) and [ opresses women ] ( https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/10/28/womens-rights-iran ) or the country that [ beheads gays ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_saudi_arabia ) and [ opresses women even more ] ( http://www.theweek.co.uk/60339/nine-things-women-cant-do-in-saudi-arabia ), 
  well there are significant amounts of brexiteers who were labour and even [ snp voters ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/03/what-next-snp-voters-who-voted-brexit ) also roughly half of conservatives voted remain not to mention how brexiteers just get downvoted and berated considering how pro eu , and understandabely so , this sub is . 
  you naturally do n't many anti eu people on a pro eu sub, 
  i can see why an indian person would n't be a great fan however we were n't ever educated about the bengali famine or his rather offensive comments towards the hinu religion though so most people simply view him as the person who `` won us the war '' can guarantee if people actually knew about cromwell and churchill 's dark side they would n't think them too great, 
   i do n't understand how do the tories get so many votes while being so horrible . 
  you really should be telling us you 're a turk so you 've seen erdogan trying to enforce all sorts of shit for a long time , and just generally acting as an authoritarian fuck - this is ( relatively ) new to us in comparison, 
  you 're lucky that you actually have free speech and ( some ) politicians who support it here it 's basically accepted that no one is fully committed to total free speech and it 's just varying levels of authoritarianism i mean people are already being [ arrested for online `` hate speech '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/arrests-for-offensive-facebook-and-twitter-posts-soar-in-london-a7064246.html ) here, 
   yes they will . 
  the government is going out of their way to make it undesirable for companies to hire foreign workers . 
  it really already is - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdlaaemrrge this video ^ gives an educated americans perspective on how restricitve laws already were back in early 2016 when the tories had been trying for years to reach the same arbitrary number they think they 'll reach this time around it did n't work for camerons government and , whilst it may be more succesfull , i highly doubt she 'll meet the exact same `` in the tens of thousands '' figures she 's aiming for - especially considering that their leaving student numbers in the figures, 
  i love how you 're being downvoted to shit for respectfully having a different opinion, 
  normally they would n't in the way that they are , they had to coalition in 2010 after all but people who were pro brexit and labour moved to the tories as they did n't trust corbyn with giving them a hard brexit ^ tm, 
   if it makes you any happier , the list contained most of sd 's top staff . 
  nah , just because it 's happening to people i do n't like does n't change much - still terrible imo  try to judge them by their program rather than their past though . 
  i do n't imagine that makes them look much better , however my point was merely that a country has to be in a pretty bad state to be able to overlook a parties shady history and become the opposition party ( as the sd has basically done , by becoming the second largest party in sweden ), 
  glad thats your priority sweden not the fact that a party with neo-nazi skinhead origins with hard right anti refugee feelings is now your [ second largest party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_swedish_general_election,_2018 ) totally keep focusing on registries of foreign dissident journalists and politicians, 
  [ 60 % of the population ] ( http://global100.adl.org/#country/iran/2015 ) of iran harbours antisemitic views must be lovely to live around people who hate you for who you are , much better than europe where they , * gasp * respect you as a human being, 
  can i ask why you have one of spains previous flags as your flair ? 
  ( genuine question , i 'm curious as to the reason why ),

  would someone think of the poor saracens, 
  of course this is true , but when a government promises such a thing then they should respect the result and then silently agree to no more referendums, 
  you are , of course , the arbiter of all things that are european, 
  there are more comments talking about a hijab triggering people than people actually being triggered by a hijab, 
  lem me guess , no true communism ^ tm right ? 
  it was joke dude , no need to be such a cunt - reminder , most brits on the internet did n't vote for brexit, 
  you sound posh on a level i 've never heard before, 
  and you brought that up toxic masculinity , which is basically a fucking meme how much feminists talk about it - do you have literally no fucking self awareness ? 
   also : sexist cartoon . 
  just because they made fun of a woman does n't make them sexist you idiot case # 51739 of everything becoming a sexist thoughtcrime, 
  very irish response, 
  holy shit it 's actually going to become a federal union i do n't know how to feel about this as a brit but i 'd probably take the churchill approach - i 'm all for a united states of europe , to replace america as defacto world police , but i do n't think britain should be / or could be part of it at any point, 
  keep doubling down on the contempt for the working class you oh so educated smart ^ tm neoliberal you, 
  just got to hope macron does n't fuck up in his 5 years , otherwise fn will edge closer to power, 
  yeah and had the daughter of one frances most hated people not been his opponent then i highly doubt it would have been an easy race for him ( fuck i reckon even melenchon would have given him a run for his money ), 
  good point, 
   you do n't elect parties in the austrian presidential election , but candidates backed by parties . 
  sorry to seem uneducated on this , i 'm british and we have parties that win - although i still believe that fpo backed candidates taking much larger shares of the vote counts for an increase in right wing populism, 
  the fpo scored 15 % in the 2010 presidential elections of austria and the fact that le pen made the second round this time as opposed to last time shows how much her share of the vote has increased, 
  i was n't fucking aware that sweden was currently bombing `` muslim countries '' not to mention , the attackers are never from these countries - they 're all second generation immigrants born in their respective country also stop justifying terrorism you colossal cunt, 
  of course you 're correct , i was referring however to them almost tripling their share of the presidential vote from five years beforehand, 
  i reckon marion is the most likely replacement, 
  they all increased their share of the vote though ... 
   abolish all religion , and deport all religious people to the south pole ? 
  no , you 're acting like there 's just no solution to this problem and like it 's an `` imponderable '' problem like macron believes it is it would help if we ditched the idea that multiple cultures can exist side by side in one country ( multiculturalism ) and use the american method of a melting pot instead - where they have to assimilate to the culture and ditch any unacceptable beliefs ( death to apostates , women are second class citizens , martyrdom etc. ), 
  it would also help to slow , not outright stop but slow , immigration from areas that are n't assimilating well ( so that those that have already arrived can be assimilated before more people arrive and form isolated sub cultures where they never adapt to the culture of their new country ) also halting any foreign funding , especially saudi , for mosques - or any religious place of worship - so that muslims can not be radicalised into wahhabism ( the ideology is isis and the 9/11 hijackers ) sorry to have written so much but i just wanted to provide an alternate look on this and show there are ways to tackle islamic terrorism rather than banning the quran or some shit ( like wilders wanted to do ), 
  it does n't have to , but it 's pretty fucking painfully apparent that it does in this case, 
  greece ? 
  seriously you 're going to chose a country that has , according to the adl , the highest rates of anti semitism in europe and that gave 10 % of the vote to a literal neo nazi party ? 
  maybe not the best example, 
  http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/11/daily-chart-10 not in recent years i 'm afraid as of recent years you 're far more likely to be killed by an islamist nutjob that a right winger ( which is fucking impressive , considering how much right wing people outnumber muslims ), 
   wanting change is not irrational , but acting the same way the very terrorists that are targeting us is i 'm sorry , but i was n't personally aware that a vote for le pen was equivalent to massacring hundreds of civilians and what change would be acceptable to you ? 
  if not voting in someone with a different way of addressing terrorism then what ? 
   those people do n't have problems . 
  the only people you could pretend that trump is even remotely protecting are people who work in coal and the auto industry , a minority of the population . 
  i did n't say trump was actually protecting these people , but they thought he would like the people in the rust belt , or people living in crippling poverty in south where poverty is worse than anywhere else or just the working class in general they do n't deserve to be shamed for having different political views from you - that 's just going to make them feel like upper class liberals have disdain for them even more ( and spoiler alert : no matter your policies people wo n't vote for you if they think you hate them ), 
   the americans look like they 're having fun shaming the people who voted trump in . 
  yeah shaming people for their vote is great , really makes them not think you just despise them and do n't give half a shit about their problems, 
  but we should n't ban racism or extreme speech . 
  that 's what free speech laws are there for , to protect , not just good but , bad and offensive ideas from people that want them censored . 
  the only speech that should be banned is direct calls to violence , otherwise it 's just offensive speech that people just have to deal with - you do n't and should n't have a right to not be offended not to mention police have much more important things to do than speech policing offensive racists and unpleasant people, 
  thank god , for a moment i thought they were trying to kill me / ^ s, 
  yay , nuclear annihilation !, 
  is the alt left a thing ? 
  because one group of `` alternate '' douchebags is one to many , we do n't need more of the cunts just on the left, 
  if there 's one thing we could learn from the ` muricans it 's free speech modern and supposedly forward thinking european countries having blasphemy laws is a fucking global embarrassment , we 're really supposed to be better than this edit : even if these laws go mainly unused , the simple fact they 're there and can be used against criticism of religion is bad enough in itself,
