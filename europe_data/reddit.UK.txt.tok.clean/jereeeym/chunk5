  i guess we should just have let a military dictatorship invade our territories then ? 
  if that 's what he meant then he 's a bit of a moron, 
  salt from the snp when they 're wiped the fuck out ? 
   brits who moved there this infuriates me . 
  they 've been there for hundreds of fucking years , would you have them not be allowed to vote based on where their ancestors came from ( hint : that 's morally reprehensible ) it 's their country too you know , they were all born there after all - you make it seem like they just left london a week ago when in reality most of their families have been in ireland for hundreds of years and know no other place as home, 
  but that was n't what was being implied we were n't even talking about terrorism , rather about the death penalty for apostasy being a commonly held belief by muslims . 
  when you openly admit i did n't say `` all muslims '' but have to fall back on `` well you implied it '' it 's quite clear you know you 're wrong - i implied nothing about all muslims being terrorists , but you read that into my comments to try and paint me ( and the op comment ) as a to-muslim bigots, 
  you are so stupid my head hurts he did n't mention muslims believing this , let alone fucking all of them , he simply stated the official position of the religion outlined through the quran is that death is the sentence for apostasy that is n't a generalisation because he did n't say '' all muslims agree with the quran on this issue '' he simply stated that the religion itself is quite clear about all this also many muslims who are n't jihadis and would never actually harm anyone themselves believe in death for apostates , it 's not an uncommon belief amongst muslims just look at this poll that shows how many muslims believe sharia law should be the law of the land ( sharia contains within it the punishment of death for apostasy ) http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/ i do n't think these millions of muslims that support sharia are all jihadis , but they ( those who support sharia law ) almost certainly all believe in death for apostasy, 
   are you trying to say that an idea is false just because other people share it ? 
  it 's false because it 's a blatant fucking straw man no one here said `` literally all muslims are terrorists guys '' it 's a cliche because it 's basically always a straw man of people who said nothing of the sort and no i 'm not suggesting all muslims are terrorists , neither was the person you were responding to . 
  no one brought up `` all muslims '' being anything , least of all terrorists , except you, 
  except chechnya / s, 
  i think you spelled amerikkka wrong / s, 
  i seriously hope this is satire 1 ) not all ^ tm 2 ) what about other religions 3 ) thr crusades you 've managed all 3 cliches that people defend islam with , well done, 
  i do n't disagree , i was n't suggesting she was a good candidate at all just that she could have gotten more votes if she was n't such a shit debater certainly not supporting her, 
  sir nigel of farage, 
  why the fuck are they still a party ? 
   luxembourgish . 
  til luxembourgish is a langauge, 
  she should learn to fucking debate properly , she could have potentially gottten a fair share of the vote and set herself up for a 2022 run if she was n't so hopeless at putting forward her own plan ( rather than endlessly attack macron 's ), 
  just do n't mention gibraltar , that makes em pretty pissed apparently, 
   ( english lets be honest ) well the welsh voted for it too , although it is sort of a tradition to forget about the welsh at this point, 
  you 're either a corrupt banker or a self proclaimed marxist what a fucking state that party is in, 
  from what i can tell , as a foreigner , the french tend to be a lot less prudish and more open to stuff like this then say the germans , brits or americans are seems like the sort of thing that france , and probably italy as well , would be just fine with, 
  calculating and uncharismatic but also quite intelligent . 
  also she 's probably the best of a bad lot as her party goes , certainly glad we did n't get some back bench religious loon on top of all that i ca n't see any possible future where she is n't prime minister for the next 10 years , purely because of corbyn being absolutely unelectable to his core, 
   protest strategy that 's a funny way of spelling `` rioting like a fucking coward '', 
  do it democratically , not by potentially killing a police officer, 
  i think he was just taking the piss, 
  we 'll have the western part including istanbul , that rural bit can bugger off though, 
  nothing quite like selling your soul for some fucking oil is there belgium ? 
  10 % is a sizeable amount of people to get to vote for you , as you showed that could make the two candidates even if it switched ( im obviously not saying this will/could happen , but statistically that makes all the difference this election ), 
  not germany but it 's still a valid point - over [ 50 % of police officers in france ] ( http://www.lopinion.fr/blog/secret-defense/sondage-51-gendarmes-marine-pen-124713 ) stated they would vote for marine le pen, 
  oh my favourite the `` horseshoe do n't real you reductionists '' crowd fascism takes its support from the often uneducated working class and eventually leads to an authoritarian state that oppresses political rivals communism takes its support from the often uneducated working class and eventually leads to an authoritarian state that oppresses political rivals the reason you hate horseshoe theory so much is because it shows your similarities with the fascists and far right that you claim are so different , when in reality you have quite a lot in common, 
  literally no one mentioned muslims , and there 's like 4 idiots who did n't get the joke and got down voted, 
  is n't that sturgeons analogy for scottish independence ? 
  belarus has an opposition leader ? 
  [ i 've detected a possible second case ] ( https://twitter.com/obamamalik?ref_src=twsrc%5egoogle%7ctwcamp%5eserp%7ctwgr%5eauthor ), 
  an easy title to earn, 
  what great political analysis , comparing the eu to football, 
  i get the logic behind it but that simply wo n't mobilize enough of the melenchon supporters , people do n't often like lesser of two evils scenarios - they need something that makes them enthusiastic to vote for macron, 
  the `` lets slander the opposition and call them bernie bros and brocialists '' tactic did n't work in america and it sure as shit wo n't work against the people voting for a female candidate in france ( not saying i think she 'll win , just that this strategy is ineffective at best ), 
  wales is pretty much pitch black apparently, 
  each ? 
  yorkshire , the rightful new ruler of all of england, 
  well it 's a protestant country , and was obviously more religious when he was in power , so i imagine that some people made it an issue, 
  tony blair needs to stop pretending that people do n't universally despise him , you got us into a horrific war that killed hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilians and still do n't feel the slightest bit of remorse you sociopathic cunt . 
  stop trying to be relevant , we do n't want your shit anymore, 
  sorry if i seemed angry or something , definitely was n't in the best of moods yesterday, 
  what a fucking cesspit they 're so desperate for this country to fail just to be proved right, 
  there 's nothing we could do to make them give us a sweet deal beyond not leaving the eu and grovelling for their forgiveness they want to set an example, 
   resistence against the election of donald trump . 
  is this `` resistance '' like peaceful protests that happened , or do you mean like burning shit and rioting which also occurred ? 
  you 're correct , some certainly did ( although not all ^ tm of course ), 
  this is certainly one of the reasons behind brexit too though - fear , whether rational or irrational , of the refugee crisis being used by isis fighters and the risk of more terrorism . 
   these people are n't irish neither are any of the immigrants that go to live in ireland , but that being said i do get your point about not wanting to become a passport farm, 
  ah , so he 's becoming a citizen of glorious true korea i see, 
  this will be interesting i do n't share your beliefs in a lot of matters but i 've got to admire you for coming on here and doing this, 
   most likely they will go the saudi arabia way and kill them individually to get the vocal ones first you actually fucking believe that too you honestly believe marine le pens death squads are going to be going from door to door killing gays do n't you ? 
  you can see why they 're mad , no one wants sanctions on their country, 
  england , both the prequel and sequel to the united kingdom, 
  and the people 's party of spain was founded by ex franco era politicians , that does n't make them fascist like how the sweden democrats is n't a neo nazi party despite originally having many skinheads and other such people in the party , they were kicked out and the party changed the democrats in the south are n't racist segregationists anymore , parties change believe it or not, 
  4d chess guis, 
  this is probably my take on it , serial killers can roast in hell forever - it 's just the problem of proof and not getting an innocent man, 
  ireland just does n't get one i guess, 
  not surprised , just think it 's funny ( also abstaining is a thing you can do ), 
  that 's hilarious , communists voting for an establishment , ex-banker , neoliberal edit : i 'm aware they 're doing it to keep le pen out , it 's still hilarious that they would n't simply abstain, 
  holy shit a scottish eurosceptic ? 
  i 've seen it all now, 
  well you fucking dodged a bullet there lads, 
  remind me !, 
  2 weeks, 
  his teeth look a bit odd , but yeah he 's hardly `` repulsive '', 
   autocrats you 're aware that france wo n't become an autocracy just because marine le pen get 's elected ( which she likely wo n't even be ), 
  here i was thinking this map was entirely accurate ... 
  so she 's a nazi because she made a potentially revisionist statement ? 
  i mean , it 's not like she said it did n't happen , or that it was n't a bad thing - she just made the point that france was n't responsible because the nazis were in charge ( not that i necessarily agree with that ) no exactly the `` hitler did nothing wrong '' stuff that her father was known for, 
  and more seats than he had in 2012, 
  `` anti fascist protesters have clashed with police '' colour me fucking shocked , the far left being violent to police ? 
  what a surprise, 
  ok let 's give this a try , why exactly is marine le pen a nazi ? 
  bearing in mind the nazis killed millions , you 'll have to equate her to that, 
  they tried and failed something a few weeks ago , it 's basically the fucking troubles all over again / s there was a point when virtually every week there would be an ira attack , considering there 's barely been any since the gf agreement then i 'm comfortable saying that they 're gone, 
  and less politicians who are under formal investigation and scandal ridden ... 
  terrorism in europe is , but in france it is higher if i remember correctly ( obviously for countries like the uk and spain it 's lesser as the ira and basque terrorists are n't around any longer ), 
   the face of acceptable english nationalism is british nationalism well thank fucking you supreme leader for telling us which holidays are acceptable to celebrate and which are haram , i 'll keep that in mind next time i have the evil thought of being proud of my country, 
   why is this on a map of europe  brits who understandably do n't want to be brits dude , fucking savage, 
  hey i 'm really unhappy about what you just said , wait ... 
   it 's not an especially pleasant festival . 
  far too associated with football culture to be worth reclaiming . 
  i do n't think you get the point of reclaiming do you reclaiming is literally all about getting rid of those negative connotations , whether they be real or vastly exaggerated as many of yours are , and making it no longer to do with those things . 
  if it was reclaimed , people would n't think about drunkenness and hooliganism but rather pride for ones nation and history, 
  the thought of nuclear war terrifies me this statement is equally relevant to this post as yours was, 
  you 're probably the most upper class sounding person i 've ever seen, 
  [ republican screeching ], 
  it was a joke , not political analysis you uptight douche bag, 
  that explains what a fascist is , not why fn is fascist, 
  tbh it may be annoying but we 've got to learn to take it better , rather than this retard complaining about `` muh racism about the english '' op was clearly kidding , not being `` racist '', 
  well he is an american so he 's probably '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' `` irish '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '', 
   if you said this to my face , it would be a good fucking time .
