  its the only film that has me in tears at the end scene when the main character sees the cut footage ( if you know which part im talking about ) . 
  absolutely beautiful . 
  damn you french have the best national anthem in the world . . rousing and patriotic . 
  en direct sur france . . 
  second that mate . 
  1 ) 1993 2 ) musician , fool , depressive , hyperactive , happy and loving 3 ) being happy and enjoying each moment i 'm here, 
   here are some penis statues below here , so do n't load them if that offends you . 
  this is / r/europe you know . . not / r/unitedstatesofamerica mate . . its just a penis statue, 
  time to rekindle the old empire do n't you think ? 
  minerva and mars will see to them, 
  ** are we losing our universal health care ? 
  ** i dont believe so . . i mean . . the nhs is hugely valued here and if anything happened to it there would be huge backlashes with the public outcry and within the nhs so despite the tory 's wanting to mess the nhs around . . they wont due to the backlash they would receive . 
  ** are we becoming overrun by dangerous immigrants ? 
  ** not really . . we have a few looners here and there ... much like anywhere else in the world . 
  the indian/caribbean immigrants from the 50s/60s/70s have pretty much made successes of themselves and their communities by becoming `` british '' and creating their own businesses across the country and opening trade further . 
  the main concern is those who enter with a completely backwards frame of mind and going against the ideals and laws that we have in place in our country and wanting to do harm against the people or to each other with forced marriage etc etc. 
  i could widely speculate by saying the same thing about mexican immigrants being sneaky and hopping the fence but i wont because that 's a broad statement ** europeans are racist ** again , huge broad sweeping statement trying to tar every european ... kind of like me saying `` all americans are hugely obese , clap at everything , shoot guns all the time and cry every september 11th '' you get many many people from all over europe who are welcoming and who are friendly like americans ( its not exclusively an american thing to be friendly you know ! ), 
  but . . we kind of have a limit of not striking a conversation on the bus with a complete stranger as its odd ... unless we are both drunk . 
  but of course you get racists everywhere . . id say the majority of the uk/europe isnt racist but those who are tend to be the ones most afraid much like in the us , with those fella 's who dressed like spooky ghosts because the black man could shred on guitar and make `` dem white laydeees '' wet . . whereas the banjo didnt have the same effect . 
  ** more authoritarian ** i believe this is quite the universal problem to a whole lot of western countries with snooping charters etc. . `` freedom aint free buddy '' but to be honest . . im still pretty much free to do whatever i want as long as im not out punching the elderly off their mobility scooters whilst downloading `` how to be a terrorist for dummies '' on my stolen phone ... aka being a twat . 
  and i imagine its the same in the us . 
  dont be a dickhead and you wont get stopped . 
  but i do believe some of our freedoms are slowly being stripped by governments that seem to be more worried about its people than supportive . 
  thats a problem we all need to address . 
  thank you prussia !, 
  ah do one mate . . at / r/europe everyone shits on everyone else . . everybody gets a turn . 
  the uk gets made to sound like its united kingdomstan or 1984 by a lot of different countries , especially by the us , so if i was you . . i would n't think too much of it . 
   the usa is just simply the only country in the world right now that is worth living in because of all the jobs , economic conditions , and tolerant multicultural society with that mentality then im not surprised you find people from other countries giving you shit . 
  its kind of like me saying `` the french are smelly and smoke too much '' but i dont think anyone would complain about that statement as it has factual truth behind it . 
  waterloo forever . 
  these beautiful european ( italian ) gardens can hypnotize you and you wo n't believe what happens next ... 
  surely that 's the police 's responsibility and not the general public to wade out with guns looking for the `` bad guy '' ? 
  we have our culture differences so to me having an alert on your phone with different sorts of `` danger '' being projected and beeped to you is super odd to me . 
  thats super creepy not gunna lie . 
  i know reddit makes the uk out to be a totalitarian 1984 state ( looking at you / r/worldnews ) but having an update on my phone screaming with a buzzer saying what `` alert '' the area is on ... thats fucking weird . 
  `` errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrnnn !!!!! '', 
  what the fuck was that dave ? 
  oh its my be scared alarm . . just before i forget . 
  they are already out of style though . . clean shaven is the way to go , 
  ahhhhh you cheeky italian !!!, 
  xd yeah we do give off the grumpy vibe but i think its mostly due to constant rain/grey and sexual frustration . 
  haha but seriously a whole bunch of us want more involvement with our euro fratelli e sorelle . 
  as a strict follower of mara and dibella i love you all but not the racist followings of . . ehem ... ulfric, 
  stormcloak racist scum . 
  long live the empire . 
  stick a big giant skeleton in the mediterranean with his arm outstretched and his finger pointing back to africa with a large sign saying `` be warned ye who cross these seas are sure to perish !, 
  turn back ye boats now ! '',

  i blame the italians for the roman ideals for planting the seed my smokey , sweaty , baguette eating friend ... if only we had seen eye to eye then i 'm sure we could have halved the globe to each other . . 
  we would have taken the world .

  mate , do one . 
  i was on jsa for nearly a year , even with education and the right skills , and i was busting my bollocks applying for everything i possibly could , even writing to everyone who was n't advertising , offering myself for work unpaid , i was and still am volunteering in a charity shop , iv attended interviews and done unpaid work for trials and it was only last week that someone gave me a job . 
  ( barista isnt much but im damn happy to be off jsa and im striving to work in creative advertising ) dont blindly assume that we dont want to do work because there is a fuck load of educated young men and women who arent even shown the slightest interest by employees in this day and age . . who each and every day have to keep themselves fed , sheltered , and optimistic without succumbing to the constant bombarding feeling of `` i cant buy this , public transport is too expensive for a return il get a single and walk back , how much can i spend on food for a week and have money to get to the interview '' with the added bonus of the media saying your a scrounging cunt who deserves nothing ... but no ... `` the local workforce dont like it '' right ? 
  [ yup ... i feel you man .

  [ a german saying there 's too much work ? 
  i mean , if your into the whole sexually frustrated , scraggly beard , lazied/red eyed type of guys then my advice would be ... 
  folk singers . 
  i think they would be too apathetic to blow anything up ... waaaaaaaay sexier imo . 
  france is better without them and should be prepared to , unfortunantly , face them either at home or in another land .

  he was yes but . . he didnt push his luck . 
  the moment you push your luck in being a knobhead . . then . . your a knobhead in the back of a police van . 
  do n't be a knobhead and you 'll be fine .
