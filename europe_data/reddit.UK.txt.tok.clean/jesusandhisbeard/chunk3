  iv ' e got a couple of box sets to get through , some cheese and crackers and comfy sofa 's so if you fancy waiting for the whole `` nuclear apocalypse '' to blow over you are all welcome .

  why !? 
  cromwell was a total arse . 
  cavaliers dressed better and partied harder than the roundheads . 
  the whole casting was perfect with their characters ( especially titus in my opinion ) and how they fit around the story . 
  i also really admired the fact they went all out on sets and scenery by building their own and filming in italy . 
  all in all ( although , obviously , its not all historically accurate with some clothing etc ) i think its the best historical series hbo/bbc have produced in a damn while . 
  and if anyone says otherwise well ... then [ marc antony said it best ... ] ( http://imgur.com/51sk5wm ), 
  well my gods are still minerva , mars , fortuna and of course bacchus . . i mean , jesus christ and company enjoyed the grape but not nearly enough as bacchus did . 
  he was brilliant for the role was n't he ? 
  just the other week i got the box set brand new in a charity shop for 8 quid ... not bad !, 
  why the hell did you leave us !? 
  i know you had trouble at home and what have you but . . could n't you have stayed in the north east of england ? 
  i mean , you built a wall and everything plus you left a bunch of your jewlery , weapons , armour and other great things in my home town . . could n't you have just stayed a wee bit longer ?? 
  bloody jumped up angles coming over here after you left and messed everything up . . [ roma invicta ] ( http://imgur.com/eiqkevz ),

  france ... you just could n't ask for a better adversary . 
  scotland had a bash , ireland had a bash , wales had a bash but non came close to the french . 
  well in my experience as an englishman it tends to happen during a dinner , nightout or other informal ( even formal events ) the man will approach the lady of his choosing and nudge her not once , not twice but thrice with his bulging member squashed inside of his finest beige chinos lightly on said ladies pelvic region . 
  if she responds negativily usually the male will shout to his fellow men in the room/club/street / pub wall something a long the lines of `` oi . 
  we have got a lesbian here lads . '', 
  and saunter back to his pack with his pride damaged but his reputation with his fellow males raised slightly higher , thus making him a quote un quote ; `` top lad '' ** now ... ** if the lady of his choosing responds positively towards his nudging with his groin , also known as the `` birmingham budge '' , he may consider the following routes to take to thus court this woman into his place of copulation . 
  ** option 1 ** if the lady has smiled and felt his hot member on her hip the full blooded british male may then , as is tradition , take out his genitals and cup them in his hand as a gesture of thanks towards the female . 
  usually this is accompanied by the traditional saying of `` look at my sausage darling , dont you want your chops around that ? '', 
  9/10 times this approach works with an extra added bonus if the male cocks his eyebrow as if to say `` you know you want it . . you slag . '', 
  ** option 2 ** if the lady is pleased with her gift of unwashed penis against her summer dress , even if its the winter , she may respond with `` i do . '', 
  in which case as in typical fashion the man will force himself to gain a painful erection and quickly gather as many people as he can to create bunting and trinkets to wrap around his stiff member so that for this time only his choice of female may use it as a may pole for her and her friends to dance around till they fall tired or sick with alcohol poisoning . 
  this may be embarrising for the male and his status within his male pack group may dip for a short while , thus resorting in him getting the scraps of meat from a dixy chicken and not the best meat reserved for the alpha males , but he is guaranteed 100 % that this lady will allow him to part her pale , chubby thighs and stick his cold , skinny , nail bitten , pastey little fingers inside her fanny in the smelly toilet cubical . 
  these actions i have described above are what we brits describe as `` romantic gestures '' for more information please read my book * oscar cramingcunts english guide to romance , sticky underpants and flirtation * available in all good french book stores . 
  aww a spaniard giving sympathy to us ... no hard feelings for our past conflicts or your armada mate .

  bring back the byzantine empire !, 
  good . 
  the greek people need what is rightfully theirs , 
  no i do n't think thats the case at all because this has been happening all across the united kingdom from london to glasgow to belfast . 
  i believe this nationwide `` performance '' in towns and cities is to bring the ghosts of ww1 soldiers to life . 
  in essence bringing colour and a new reality of the men in all these cities and towns who left 100 years ago can confront the modern world face to face . 
  i think it 's rather a solemn tribute . 
  if someone in the street/station can stop and watch these men portraying those who went 100 years ago and remember then that is more effective for personal remembrance . 
  but thats just my take from it . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what your getting at here mate, 
  huh ? 
  what do you mean by that opeixe ? 
  indy is absolutely cracking isnt he ?
