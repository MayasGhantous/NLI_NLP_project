  by many others he is perceived as a genocidal , mass murdering rapist . 
  should we take down all of his statues or not ? 
  and in any case , i disagree about napoleon . 
  here he is often seen as a war monger who wanted to dominate the continent . 
  if i got a scholarship to study in paris should the monument to him be taken down if i demand it ? 
  but it 's not just renaming stuff . 
  they are demanding that his statue be removed from the campus . 
  if we 're going down that route shall we also take down napoleon 's statue in paris . 
  i mean he killed thousands in his wars to dominate europe . 
  and how about all those statues and paintings of george washington over the usa . 
  he was a slave owner after all . 
  should all public statues and painting of him be taken down ? 
  how about all the historical statues of europe royalty around the continent ? 
  many of them did a lot of horrible shit . 
  shall we remove all of these statues from public ? 
  we 're going to have to replace a fuck load of public art if we remove all of the portrayals of controversial figures from our history . 
  dieting does n't have to mean going on some fad diet . 
  it can also mean eating a healthy balanced diet within a certain calorie limit . 
  nothing unhealthy about that . 
  and childhood obesity can also fuck your body when it 's developing . 
  yes , but thats not really an issue . 
  the ons puts them at 2.4 % of all jobs and [ zero hour workers are as contented with their work and hours and full time employees . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25098984 ), 
   i am starting to see it become more like a united states situation where people are working 2 or 3 jobs or taking lots of overtime and working 60-70 hours a week just to get by . 
  erm , 60-70 hour weeks on the current uk minimum wage would give you a post tax income of # 1639 a month . 
  with the upcoming minimum wage increases that will go up to # 2113 by 2019 . 
  hardly scraping by . 
  where on earth have you got all this nonsense from ? 
   they 've failed in everything else . 
  most spectacularly of all they 've completely in their # 1 goal when they came into power . 
  their vigorous socially destructive cuts have done nothing to reduce the deficit . 
  in the last budget the deficit was the same as it was in 2010 . 
  [ nope . 
  ] ( https://fullfact.org/economy/election_2015_debt_deficit-43413 ) the deficit as a percentage of gdp has halved since the tories came to power . 
  in absolute terms it has also decreased significantly . 
  and :  debt continues to tick up at an alarming rate , as in addition to rising government debt tory cuts have preceded an explosion of personal debt . 
  [ nope ] ( http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/researchbriefing/summary/sn02885 ) household debt as a percentage of disposable income is at the lowest since the coalition/tories came to power . 
  and :  productivity is ( astoundingly ) down , [ somewhat misleading . 
  ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bfe893e8-682c-11e5-97d0-1456a776a4f5.html#axzz3uwgwzpth ) it is n't down but it has been stagnant for a while . 
  [ thankfully it is now rising much faster . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34410030 ) and :  wages are not increasing in any meaningful sense [ nope . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/sep/16/uk-wages-rising-at-quickest-rate-in-six-years ) wages are growing at 3 % . 
  this is somewhere in between the germany and the usa and only about 1 % below the pre recession average and :  the tories have cut the top rate of tax highly misleading . 
  the top rate of tax under almost the whole of the last government was 40 % it is now 45 % . 
  they have increased it . 
   i 'm also not entirely sure where they even got this welfare spending figure from . 
  only 23 % of spending is on welfare and that includes the state pension . 
  from the article you linked  there is no single definition for the ` welfare budget ' ; some claims just cover benefits payments , others add in admin costs and social services . 
  and  hm treasury 's figures on public spending -- which are also used in each budget -- use a much broader category : ` social protection ` spending , which captures payouts and admin costs combined . 
   total social protection spending came to about # 231 billion in 2013/14 : about 35 % of public spending . 
  so it seems the discrepancy is because the treasury is using a broader definition which includes admin costs and other types of social protection . 
  the 23 % you quote is only for spending on benefits administered by the department for work and pensions . 
  so that does n't include admin costs or social welfare administered by other departments such as child benefit and guardian 's allowance account for # 11 billion a year which are managed by hmrc . 
  that being the case , the graph looks pretty accurate to me . 
  i also do n't think that they were trying to be misleading by not breaking it up . 
  you could say the same for the other types of spending , for example how much is going towards higher education from the education budget . 
  i know what you mean . 
  last time i went to to my local shop they literally shoved halal sausages into my mouth as i was walking around . 
  and when i get back to my car ? 
  they 'd snuck a halal cow carcass in the boot . 
  when will the madness end !, 
  interestingly the asterisk next to the uk indicates the data is 6 months out of date . 
  it 's actually fallen a further 0.2 % in that time shifting us down another spot . 
  ideally trolling is best done on a fresh account . 
  otherwise people can see your negative comment karma . 
  because i do n't like having super dry hands all day . 
  and i 've never been ill from eating my own shit so i 'm guessing i 'm doing alright . 
  out of interest , do you wash your hands after you 've touched any objects ? 
  because there are bound to be people who did n't wash after a shit and have touched door handles , phones , taps etc. 
  it 's quite common to have a toilet in a separate room here , but there is always a small hand basin in there as well . 
  true . 
  but then i ca n't imagine i 'd get super dirty doing that in my own home . 
  i 'm not exactly daubing shit on the handle . 
  in other people homes though ( and feel free to call me a germaphobe ) i use a piece of toilet paper to touch the flush . 
  it 's worse in public surely when you do wash with soap but then have to open the toilet door . 
  i guess so . 
  which makes the question quite useless . 
  not necessarily . 
  in fact the article even says :  forty-four per cent were in favour of mrs merkel remaining in power . 
  looking at [ this ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/06/soap-how-much-cleaner-does-it-actually-make-your-hands/258839/ ) , it seems to suggest that using just water halves the chance of getting ill and using soap and water halves it again . 
  kind of a rubbish question . 
  after a piss ? 
  a quick , no soap rinse . 
  a dump ? 
  soap and water . 
  so my answer is yes and no . 
  [ shit 's actually far better than it ever has been ] ( http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ourworldindata_wars-after-1946-state-based-battle-death-rate-by-type.png ), 
  and i thought feminists said the stereotype that they use false rape allegations as a weapon was wrong . 
  where does it say that ? 
  i must have missed it . 
  to be clear , what this is referring to is a cut in the `` supertax '' levied on oil production in the north sea in light of $ 40 a barrel oil . 
  i imagine he was speaking metaphorically . 
  in the deep south atheists have come up in polls as some of the [ least trusted people/most disliked groups in the usa . 
  ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22059841 ) people have even been [ denied custody of their children or been denied jobs for their atheism . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/16/atheists-discrimination_n_4413593.html ) really not the same for republicans in the uk . 
  i do n't really think so . 
  it 's happened before and it does n't really matter . 
  it 's just a fancy old tradition . 
  if you do n't follow it you can still be sworn in . 
  the only reason it 's being spoken about here is the press are having a field day pissing on corbyn and portraying him as some kind of radical .
