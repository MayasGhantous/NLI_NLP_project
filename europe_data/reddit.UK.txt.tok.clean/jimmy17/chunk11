  personally i think he is a decent guy with some crap policies . 
  all the other stuff like this is fluff . 
  subsidised canteens are not uncommon although mine is a particularly good one . 
  i 'd rather not say my specific employer 's name but i work for a body that supports science in the uk . 
  also free unlimited vending machine chocomilk . 
  this is how i die . 
  and the dream was taken away as quickly as it came . 
  what ?!, 
  i did n't know you could use the vouchers and still get the extra student burger !, 
  my workplace has a subsidised caf\u00e9 . 
  it 's # 2.50-3 .00 for a full cooked meal . 
  # 1.50 for a jacket potato and filling . 
  # 1 for soup . 
  tea and coffee are free . 
  i should have said around 4 % but that 's hardly any better . 
   when scientists seem unlikely to worry about this ? 
  but they are worried . 
  here are some quotes from the article i linked . 
  there are many more . 
   the changes are also bad for science , says fyodor kondrashov , a russian biologist at the centre for genomic regulation in barcelona , spain . 
  `` the problem is that it appears that all scientific output is being treated as potentially classified , '' he says . 
  `` this creates an unhealthy research climate with some scientists preferring not to share information -- not to give a talk at a conference abroad , for example . 
  i fear that the authorities will choose to apply this law selectively against their critics . '' and  the demand for approval runs counter to government efforts to strengthen and internationalize russian science , says severinov [ sergey salikhov , director of the russian science ministry 's science and technology department , told nature ], 
  maybe it does . 
  it certainly has given a lot in the past . 
  for now it 's going the wrong way and shows no signs of turning back . 
  erm , yeah . 
  i do . 
  russia is a relatively poor country with an economy contracting at almost 5 % per year that is seemingly more concerned with [ having it 's scientific output vetted by the secret services ] ( http://www.nature.com/news/russian-secret-service-to-vet-research-papers-1.18602 ) than actually producing quality science . 
  that three years ago russia came 6th in the number of patents granted in the year . 
  erm good one . 
  although perhaps we should use a slightly more relevant metric . 
  one that does n't put [ toilet snorkels ] ( http://totallyabsurd.com/toilet%20snorkel%20tai%20big.jpg ) on the same level as graphene . 
  perhaps the [ international innovation index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_innovation_index ) . 
  russia is 49th . 
  that 's fair enough . 
  it is pretty good that it 's getting sorted out now . 
  but you just know these companies have very well paid accountants looking for the next target !, 
  but surely you can understand why people point to ireland in this discussion given that such a massive tax loophole has been run for almost 30 years out of ireland . 
  and i know laws take time to implement by 7 years from the announcement ? 
  and only after the eu , the us and the oecd . 
  [ for example . 
  ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ba95cff0-4fcd-11e4-a0a4-00144feab7de.html#axzz3pufl2c6u ) its not like the irish government had n't noticed . 
  they were enjoying the benefits it gave them . 
  this is only being shut down now due to significant external pressure . 
  perhaps you should point it the other way . 
  [ ahem . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement ), 
  it 's probably in stocks and shares . 
  ca n't really tax the growth in the value of those . 
  he will ( hopefully ) be taxed if and when he decides to cash them in . 
  true , but it 's hardly unique . 
  i ca n't really think of a single developed country that does n't have strong trade with china . 
  there is nothing necessarily wrong with zero hours work . 
  in fact a study from 2013 showed that [ zero-hour workers are about as satisfied , if not more so , with their employment conditions and hours than full time workers . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25098984 ) also , all of the doom-mongering about the numbers of zero hour contracts is also nonsense . 
  [ this ] ( https://fullfact.org/factcheck/economy/zero_hour_contracts_facts-41165 ) is a pretty good discussion on this . 
  the important points being :  the statistics do not and can not show an `` epidemic '' in zero hours contracts . 
  comparisons of the number of people on zero hours contracts over time are not reliable , as the office for national statistics makes clear . 
  which incidentally means that your statement about zero-hours contracts being at an all time high is not really true . 
  also :  the statistics do show that 66 % of people on zero hours contracts fall in the category of ` does not want more hours ' . 
  the statistics alone do not show that everybody on zero hours contracts , or even a majority of them , are dissatisfied . 
   the latest ons release shows that people whose main employment is a zero hours contract account for 2.3 % of people in employment . 
  this is 1 in 43 -- or to a round number 1 in 40 , not 1 in 50 as the conservative party has said . 
  so if these numbers are correct , then the number of people on zero-hour contracts that actually want more work account for about 0.78 % of the working population . 
  not too bad i 'd say . 
   what if i get sick ? 
  have to move to a region with lower pay than what i expected ? 
  what if i just want to travel for a half a year ? 
  then you pay less or potentially do n't have to pay it back at all . 
  it 's taken directly out of your salary at a rate of 9 % on anything you earn over # 21,000 and the remainder of the debt is forgiven at 65 . 
  not sure why you would n't believe these figures . 
  they 're calculated by an independent body to an internationally recognised standard . 
  i was using the room as an analogy . 
  with the original article it is a calculated value , not a guess . 
  but lets assume the room example was also calculated . 
  then yes , there may be 70 people in the room but there was a 99-1 chance that it was n't the case . 
  or to put it another way . 
  the guy would be right 99 times and wrong once for every hundred times he counted . 
  not exactly . 
  it means that there is a 99 % chance your result is within 5 % of the actual value . 
  blimey , now you 're testing me . 
  i remember the basics of the terminology but i usually use a calculator like [ this ] ( http://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm ) to do it these days . 
  i 'm pretty lazy . 
  i 'm afraid i ca n't recall the actual background to the mathematics off the top of my head . 
  another way to think of it is this . 
  if someone said that he knew there were 50 people in a room give or take 5 people and that he was 99 % sure of this , then confidence interval is 5 and the confidence level is 99 % . 
  apologies . 
  a confidence interval is the level of error on the measurement . 
  the confidence level is how sure we can be that the results are correct . 
  to put it in to context , if we say we have a confidence interval of 5 % at a confidence level of 95 % , then what we mean is that we can be 95 % sure that the result given here is within 5 % of the true result . 
  from the numbers given on the wiki page ( a sample size of 500 and a total british muslim population of 2.7 million ) there is a confidence interval of 5.5 with a 99 % confidence level . 
  to rephrase that , we can be 99 % sure that the percentage given is within 5.5 % of the true value . 
  so we can be 99 % sure the true answer is between 30.5 - 41.5 % . 
  it 's a bit out of date perhaps but that is a perfectly valid sample size ( assuming the sample was of good quality ) . 
  with a muslim population of 2.6 million , a confidence interval of 5 % and a confidence level of 95 % you would need a sample size of only 384 . 
  or to work it out the other way with the numbers given , there is a confidence interval of 5.5 with a 99 % confidence level . 
  to rephrase that , we can be 99 % sure that the percentage given is within 5.5 % of the true value . 
   too old and do n't have fuses in the power box . 
  bit of a contradiction there .
