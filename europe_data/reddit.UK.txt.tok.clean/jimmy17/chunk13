  they also have their own parliament meaning they have many powers devolved to them to vote on scottish matters and the rest of the uk has no say . 
  the part where thy have more power is referred to as the [ west lothian question ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_lothian_question ) where scottish mps can vote on english matters where the english cant vote on scottish matters . 
  lets take university fees as an example . 
  this is a devolved matter . 
  the scottish parliament voted not to introduce them and uni education remains free for scottish students ( and funnily enough they used a loophole in the law so that it 's free for any eu student but not for the rest of the uk , so english students do have to pay fees in scotland . ) . 
  when the same vote happened in parliament english mps voted by majority not to introduce them but scottish mps voted for the english to have to pay for uni and now you have to pay for uni in england . 
  so the scottish tipped the balance on an english only matter where the english had no power to vote on the equivalent scottish issue . 
  slave in governmental affairs how ? 
  the snp have 54 seats in the house of commons , scotland also has a devolved parliament that can make many of its own decisions and they can even vote on english laws that do n't effect them when the reverse is n't true . 
  if anything they have slightly more political power than their english counterparts . 
  it was definitely about the money as well . 
  lest we forget [ this bullshit .

  which is british . 
  the scottish are british . 
  on the plus side , it 'll make the mental maths easier when i 'm on holiday . 
  on the downside , i ca n't afford holidays any more . 
  when did we bottom out ? 
  [ seems to reported quite a lot to me .

  i 'm not entirely sure . 
  the picture looks a little complicated . 
  according to [ this guardian article ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/16/uk-poverty-rates-office-for-national-statistics ) we have some of the lowest rates of persistent poverty risk in europe but a high turnover of people in poverty . 
  on average about 16.8 % of people are in poverty at any one time . 
  comparable to germany . 
  what do you mean ? 
  good news was posted . 
  people said `` but you have n't left yet . '', 
  i did n't offer any further analysis . 
  it 's only an observation . 
   you are still part of the single market . 
  if you expect these figures to be the same after you leave it you may be surprised . 
  i certainly do n't . 
  brexit was a stupid idea and it will almost certainly be quite harmful to the economy when we do leave . 
  still , those were a few bits of good news . 
  and it does sort of support black_teapots point . 
  well there was a report out last week , posted on / r/europe , that the [ uk economy was doing well . ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37518089 ) . 
  from the article :  the uk services sector grew 0.4 % in july , much more strongly than expected in the wake of june 's vote to leave the european union . 
  it shows consumers carried on spending as normal after june 's brexit vote . 
   other figures from the office for national statistics ( ons ) show economic growth accelerated faster than thought in the run-up to the referendum . 
   gross domestic product ( gdp ) grew by 0.7 % in the three months to the end of june , up from the 0.6 % first estimated . 
   the second-quarter figures were well up from the 0.4 % growth of the previous quarter . 
  ons statistician darren morgan said : `` together this fresh data tends to support the view that there has been no sign of an immediate shock to the economy , although the full picture will continue to emerge . '', 
  and like black_teapot said , there were `` but you have n't left yet '' posts in the comments . 
  i believe the unemployment rate has n't budged since the vote and remains amongst the lowest in europe . 
  are you sure this is a bit of a persecution complex ? 
  this news story was reported around the world . 
  meanwhile there is often good stuff about france in our media . 
  huh ? 
  i 'm not sure i understand . 
  this was posted in news outlets around the world as it was an odd/interesting story . 
  took me all of 5 seconds on google news to find the story being reported in : * [ belguim ] ( http://www.lalibre.be/light/insolite/france-il-vandalise-un-apple-store-a-la-boule-de-petanque-video-57ee0304cd70e9985fe78c2f ) * [ the usa ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2016/09/30/think-you-have-apple-problems-they-dont-compare/91322756/ ) * [ india ] ( http://indianexpress.com/article/trending/viral-videos-trending/watch-angry-frenchman-goes-to-apple-store-and-smashes-iphones-macbook-3061198/ ) * [ australia ] ( http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/technology/smartphones/french-man-smashes-56000-worth-of-iphones-in-apple-store/news-story/40545aa4a60cf5a4d335f8fdecc514af ) * [ canada ] ( http://www.metronews.ca/news/world/2016/09/30/apple-iphone-metal-ball-smasher-france.html ) i could go on but i think you get the point . 
  the post-brexit anti-british circlejerk is getting weirder . 
  edit : [ downvotes ? 
  how could you !, 
  ] ( https://cdn.meme.am/instances/48178647.jpg ), 
  that 's really interesting . 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  i do n't quite understand what that means . 
  at a guess i think it says `` uk can not into programming '', 
  if only . 
  bloody hell , sort yourself out anglosphere !, 
  you know who else wanted land all around ? 
   how many of those medals came from the velodrome ? 
  11 in total . 
  6 gold , 4 silver and 1 bronze . 
  without the velodrome we would have still been in a comfortable third place . 
  we actually won golds in the following : cycling track , rowing , athletics , gymnastics , equestrian , sailing , swimming , diving , triathlon , boxing , taekwondo , canoe slalom , canoe sprint , field hockey , golf and tennis along with a silvers and bronzes in a few others . 
  but yeah , different countries have different cultural contexts and different levels of wealth which results in them doing well at the different sports . 
  an obvious example would be warmer countries or countries without mountains doing more poorly at the winter olympics . 
  the last one i saw on the news was the three police killed at a gas station . 
  the one before that were the 5 police killed at the blm march . 
  funnily enough some people in the march were open carrying to make a point about black people 's ability to do so . 
  i take your point though . 
  i would n't be surprised if the majority of mass shootings were such places and it does screw up the self defence plan if everyone else has been disarmed . 
  thats a good point . 
  i suppose its a matter of commitment . 
  if you 're going to allow guns you might as well do it properly . 
  it sounds a bit like having a mad nuclear weapons policy but then say you wo n't use them on weekends . 
  perhaps but i 've just had a quick look and 29 of the 50 states allow open carrying without a licence and a further 14 allow it with a licence . 
  only 7 have banned it . 
  that means you can open carry in the vast majority of the us . 
  although there may be laws about carrying into certain places like concert venues ( etc ) that i 'm unaware of . 
  fair point . 
  it does make sense that there would be cases and it simply would n't be reported . 
  at the same time there is a mass/spree shooting nearly every week in the us so i would guess that it is n't much of a deterrent . 
   how many cities in your country report not having rape rings , brit ? 
  . - calm down mate , no need to get all bend out of shape . 
  let me put it another way . 
  with a mass shooting every week then clearly this `` good gunman '' is n't a particularly good deterrent . 
  i guess you could argue both ways but with a mass shooting every week in the usa and these `` good gunmen '' rarely to be seen , i think i 'll take my chances with gun control . 
  at a quick look , up to twice as much in fact . 
  now if we could get a trade deal with 2 earths that would be pretty good !, 
  do you really not see how much of a hypocrite you are ? 
  just like female genital mutilation then . 
  do you support that too ? 
  and for the genital mutilation of girls . 
  was that a racist act against the cultures that did it ? 
  would you also support that and dismiss everyone who disagreed with it `` anti-genital mutilation crew '' and the `` that baby ca n't decide until he 's 18 '' crew ? 
  a double mastectomy is a great way to almost eliminate breast cancer in women .
