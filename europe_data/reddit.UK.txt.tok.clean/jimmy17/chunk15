  that being the case i 'd take this study with a good pinch of salt . 
   the fuck . 
  so apparently , our country is more corrupt than others because our share of facebook users is low ? 
  how does this even make sense ? 
  you can go on their website and deselect that from their metrics . 
  taking the internet participation measure out germany goes from 11th to 10th . 
  it 's not a big factor . 
  the other metrics are a little sketchy as well though . 
  well i guess you could look at the individual metrics they used then . 
  germany is ranked 11th overall . 
  for judicial independence you 're ranked 12th . 
  for budget transparency you 're 5th . 
  for trade openness you 're 11th . 
  for freedom of the press you 're 11th . 
  your e-citizenship ranking , the facebook marker you 're referring to , is 16th . 
  not vastly dissimilar . 
  if we remove the ` facebook ranking ' from the metric you go from 11th to 10th . 
  not exactly a major factor . 
  now i 'm not saying germany is a corrupt cesspool . 
  we should bear in mind that germany is 12 in the world , so pretty good overall , but by many of the other measures germany is ranked below many other countries in europe, 
  absolutely . 
  that 's up there at the other end of the spectrum . 
  reminds me of [ horeshoe theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory ), 
  too true . 
  i tend to try and get my news from a wide variety of sources . 
  and i tend to read the news from here with a big pinch of salt . 
  but the daily mail ( the paper that op posted ) is one of the biggest shitstains of a paper , even for british standards . 
  neither . 
  i think there 's just a minority of absolutely vile british people who travel abroad but make such a noise and mess that people notice it . 
  most british people who travel are respectful tourists , but you do n't tend to notice those over the racket the arseholes are making . 
  absolutely . 
  strangling seems to be a popular theme in superhero movies : * [ here 's loki strangling iron man ] ( http://images.amcnetworks.com/ifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/1228-loki-iron-man-throw.jpg ) .

  but now it 's done to a woman , all of a sudden it 's promoting domestic violence ? 
  well you are with your wine . ^ ^ let 's ^ ^ see ^ ^ how ^ ^ this ^ ^ plays ^ ^ out, 
  what will happen ? 
  if you read my comment i did n't suggest anything would . 
  i was simply asking about what constitutes unacceptable speech . 
  an example of speech that prompted the dutch police to visit a man to issue a warning was :  `` the college of sliedrecht has a proposal to receive 250 refugees in the coming 2 years . 
  what a bad plan !, 
  #letusresist '' i was wondering if this is the sort of speech that will be banned on these networks . 
  absolutely . 
   the framework decision that began all of this seems to be pretty well written . 
  what are your complaints with it [ this comment says it better than i can ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4m0i8u/internet_hate_speech_to_be_blocked_within_24_hours/d3rm5ct )  that 's nice , but i think i could have written the current uk drug laws better and i bet you do n't disagree with me either , so you pretty much just conceded your point . 
  well yes , that 's exactly my point . 
  saying that laws ca n't be written perfectly so you should n't criticise them if they 're poorly written is wrong . 
  i was using this to address your point `` if you think you can write law that can not be abused , you are living in a fantasy land . '', 
   i really do n't see the problem . 
  what he posted was interpretable either way , and the other examples given were equally so . 
  was it really ? 
  i think it 's very far fetched to say that he was potentially inciting a riot . 
  let 's take another example . 
  you posted the following :  the new uk drugs laws are very bad if the police turned up at your door tomorrow and said watch yourself or you might be held for incitement to commit drugs offences , would you think that 's ok ? 
  i mean it 's possible that your comment could be interpreted as saying to people it 's ok to use legal highs . 
  i do n't really think you were but it 's possible . 
  of course you 're not inciting people to commit drug offences but nor was this guy inciting a riot . 
  still you think it 's ok to write law vague enough to permit this abuse and even defend the abuses when they occur . 
   i do n't think you understand the first thing about how laws or the police work . 
  i mean that with all respect . 
  you know what , you are right . 
  i will totally concede that this is far from my area of expertise . 
  nor do i support hate speech . 
  i 'm just uncomfortable with the idea of the government telling companies to police what the consider to be offensive language . 
  this has been used in the past to silence criticism of the government . 
  on top of that , getting companies to enforce the law ends up with scenarios like youtube 's copyright take down bots which are so often abused by big companies or even individuals to silence speech they disagree with . 
   if you think you can write law that can not be abused , you are living in a fantasy land . 
  of course you ca n't write perfect laws does that mean we should n't try not to write vague and abusable laws . 
  if we ca n't do it perfectly then why even try at all , eh ? 
   the new uk drugs laws are very bad well to quote a wise redditor : `` if you think you can write law that can not be abused , you are living in a fantasy land . '', 
  literally impossible for the government to write perfect drugs laws so these laws are ok and should n't be criticised . 
   the person you 're referencing was warned politely not to try and stir up a riot . 
  does n't even appear he was arrested , never mind charged or convicted . 
  he had the police come to his door and issue him a warning after he posted on twitter that he disagreed with government policy . 
  he did n't even try to stir up a riot . 
  do you honestly think that 's acceptable ? 
  really ? 
  you posted the following :  the new uk drugs laws are very bad if the police turned up at your door tomorrow and said watch yourself and your criticism of the government or you might be held for incitement , would you think that 's ok ? 
  according to you it 's ok for the police to turn up and issue warnings , and intimidate people if they criticise government policy . 
  of course you 're not inciting people to commit drug offences but nor was this guy inciting a riot . 
  still you think it 's ok to write law vague enough to permit this abuse and even defend the abuses when they occur . 
  my suggestion is not to create laws so vague that they are open to such abuse . 
  a bit like the new drugs laws . 
  exactly . 
  just like copyright laws are simple so youtube automatic take down bots work perfectly every time . 
  yup , nothing could go wrong with this . 
  [ like here ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/online-anti-refugee-posts-lead-to-offline-visits-by-dutch-police/a-19005888 )  one example is mark jongeneel , a small business owner in the small city of sliedrecht who tweeted his reaction to asylum plans in his city : `` the college of sliedrecht has a proposal to receive 250 refugees in the coming 2 years . 
  what a bad plan !, 
  #letusresist ''  hours later , his mother ( with whom he lives ) contacted him to say local police had visited her house and were now on their way to his office . 
  `` i asked them what the problem was . 
  and they said , ` your tweets , ' '' jongeneel told dw . 
  `` and they asked me to be careful about my twitter behavior , because if there are riots , then i 'm responsible . '', 
  so one of the categories that will be blocked is anti-immigrant speech ? 
  who defines what counts as inappropriate anti-immigrant speech ? 
  if i were to say that i disagree with the govornments stance on immigration and think we should accept fewer refugees is that blockable ? 
  what about discussing the mass sexual assault that recently occurred and discussing the cultural background of the immigrants who have been arrested for it ? 
  huh , i never knew that .
