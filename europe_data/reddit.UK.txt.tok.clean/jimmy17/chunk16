  [ quite interesting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/industrial_revolution#belgium ), 
  and what if i 'm physically unable to and can only die with the assistance of others ? 
  or what if the jump does n't kill me and i have to suffer ? 
  or what if i 'm `` rescued '' ? 
  why not just make it legal for it to be done quickly and humanely ? 
  if that 's your suggestion then why not extend it to animals ? 
  why do we have euthanasia for pets when you could just chuck them off a cliff ? 
  does that sound humane ? 
   ilga-europe told the local this was more a result of other nations improving their policies than life in sweden getting worse for gay , lesbian , bisexual , or transgender people . 
  from the poll data : 55 % of french people want a vote and 41 % would vote to leave . 
  58 % of italians want a vote and 48 % would vote to leave . 
  that 's the 3rd and 4th biggest economies in europe . 
  hardly a forgone conclusion that it 's `` never going to happen . '', 
  in fact that 's not too dissimilar to the uk polling data a few months back . 
  thanks . 
  that 's quite helpful . 
  although 45 % still seems pretty significant to me and from the data it appears as if the majority in both france and italy support a vote . 
  pretty interesting . 
  45 % is a non-story ? 
  why is 50 % the newsworthy barrier ? 
  would `` 49 % or europeans secretly consume babies '' not be newsworthy because technically the majority do n't ? 
  45 % seems pretty big me and even more interesting is one third would vote to leave . 
  even more interesting is a majority of french and italian people want a vote ( so pretty newsworthy even by your standards ! ) . 
  ~ ~ also we do n't know if `` more then half of all europeans do n't want votes on eu '' is even true . 
  we ca n't know that if we do n't know the structure and results of the survey . 
  you ca n't just extrapolate like that . ~ ~ apparently no third option was given . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  what percentage were `` do n't know '' or `` undecided '' for example ? 
  it 'd be nice to see a source that shows that the growth in these countries is coming from them being tax havens . 
  it 's crazy . 
  in france and spain , 75-80 % of the population died !, 
  it must have felt like the apocalypse was coming . 
  that level of death is unimaginable !, 
  [ yup .

  do they call the archipelago something else in ireland ? 
  edit : [ found a page explaining it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles_naming_dispute ) did n't realise this was a thing . 
  london ? 
   most of them , but they are all 20-something millenials living in gentrified london living off the bank of mum and dad with an english lit degree . 
  are they ? 
  the two people i know who went were a 50 year old professor of chemistry and a 30 year old press officer . 
   they literally no [ sic ] nothing of the struggles of working families , nevermind immigrant families who voted to leave . 
  you seem to be able to tell a lot from a photo . 
  any real proof ? 
  haha , of course . 
  you can tell from my post history that i 'm clearly not a troll , but if you want to check out of the conversation because you ca n't answer a few simple questions , feel free . 
  at least do it gracefully !, 
  you did n't answer my question . 
  dislike how ? 
  and those are n't conclusions . 
  that 's just quoting a few stats in the article in isolation , without any real analysis of what they mean . 
  what conclusions have you drawn ? 
  everyone knows that acid attacks are higher on women globally , the context is interesting but not at all the main point of the article . 
  i would have thought this was obvious but apparently it needs spelling out for some . 
   not ignoring the parts i dislike . 
  dislike how ? 
   i belive it the reading the entire article and drawing conclusions based on such and what conclusions have you drawn ? 
  yeah , i saw it . 
  do you disagree that the article is about the uk ? 
  well yes but the article is about the uk . 
  huh , that does complicate matters . 
  i guess the proof of the pudding is in the eating with this one . 
  i 'm going to be honest here , i am absolutely no expert in this and was only going of what i 've read over time . 
  that being the case why would the deficit not be as large as the one shown by gers ? 
   a deficit following 33 consecutive years of paying in to the uk treasury . 
  i 'm not sure that 's particularly true . 
  the reality is far more complicated . 
  it 's true that if you take into account the oil and gas , scotland has consistently paid more into the uk treasury per capita than the english but it has [ also consistently taken more out . 
  ] ( http://www.gov.scot/resource/0044/00446179.pdf#page=54 ) i think it probably does end up about equal over time . 
  but that is with oil . 
  without oil , and it really is only a matter of time , scotland would have to make up a missive shortfall . 
  at the moment , given the oil price , scotland as an independednt country would be running the [ largest deficit in the oecd . 
  ] ( http://cdn2.spectator.co.uk/files/2016/03/unnamed-3.png ), 
  you know what , i 've reread the article and you 're totally right . 
  my apologies . 
  it 's not shifting blame . 
  i just think it 's curious that the uk that the other countries were forgotten . 
  i wonder why ... 
  so i assume you also want to kick out slovakia , malta , portugal and spain given that they were doing the same according to the op . 
  china still has access as they pay an ongoing fee . 
  [ and the usa will most likely be getting full access including prs access as well . 
  ] ( http://spacenews.com/euro-soyuz-orbits-two-galileo-satellites-u-s-likely-to-gain-access-to-galileos-secure-signal/ ), 
  you should probably read the article . 
  it says that access * could * be denied unless we pay a fee . 
  makes a lot of sense . 
  the system has to be maintained after all . 
  making out this is some kind of super special eu member benefit that only eu members get falls into `` 350 million a week '' realms of nonsense . 
  unless i missed china and israel ( among others ) becoming members of the eu ? 
  i can believe it . 
  the numbers are about same for people in the last two places i worked . 
  loads of people either went to the gym regularly , were members of a work football team , runners or cyclists etc. 
  i think there was also a work squash ladder . 
  do you think only brexiteers will be affected by this ? 
  the mini plant they 're talking about is in oxford and oxford voted 70 % to remain . 
  that 's because every american is a ` temporarily embarrassed millionaire ' who will inevitably work on wall street or be a silicon valley millionaire . 
  forget the fact the average swede has a higher quality of life , almost every american is above the american average !, 
  what do you mean by `` are n't discussed at all '' they 're talked about all the time . 
  you 're hardly gon na find a til the fucking mongols . 
  i see what you mean .
