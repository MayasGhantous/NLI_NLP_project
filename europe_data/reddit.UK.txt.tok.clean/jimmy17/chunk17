  i would assume that vaseline ( the brand ) would be fine then but cheaper petroleum jelly products may not have been purified sufficiently . 
   on spanish territory . 
  not on spanish territory . 
  on a neutral zone between the two . 
  the spanish have also built on their side of the neutral zone . 
  perhaps we will demolish the airport if they agree to demolish the football stadium , car parks , harbour and buildings on the other side of the isthmus . 
  then we can turn it all back into a lovely dusty neutral zone again . 
  edit : reading up on it a bit more it 's not even that simple . 
  the treaty that ceded the land to england stated that spain was giving up : `` the town and castle of gibraltar , together with the port , fortifications , and forts thereunto belonging '' . 
  to steal a section from another comment `` that included ' la torre del molino ' and devils tower which were fortifications found on the isthmus which the spanish seem to forget . 
  its a french map but you can see where their positions were . http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kw6emwp9juk/uknkttqrfpi/aaaaaaaaeto/siem2xvtcgs/s640/1799+-+barbie+du+bocage+-+spanish+lines.jpg '', 
  are we talking currently or over a century ago ? 
  are you saying it 's ok for the people of hk to be bullied by the chinese government because the british empire did the same to to china over 100 years ago ? 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  is gas not cheaper in france ? 
  here in the uk gas is about 3-4 times cheaper per kw than electricity . 
  jesus , trump and his supporters are so easy to upset . 
  are you honestly saying that anyone should be allowed to address westminster hall or somehow its a violation of their freedom of speech ? 
  i 'm not sure you quite understand what freedom of speech is . 
   when russia has a smaller economy than italy or canada or even south korea they are far less dangerous to finland seems they already have : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ), 
  or both are pretty close . 
  still the other side should be listened too . 
  especially regarding hard/soft brexit . 
  they do . 
  they have representatives in the house of commons . 
  if you 're suggesting that the countries of the uk should each hold a veto or some extra say then england also does n't have a vote by that standard . 
  using maps like that is very misleading . 
  38 % of scots voted for brexit so it 's hardly `` completely '' . 
  if you use that standard , [ scotland almost `` completely '' voted to remain in the uk . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides/results ), 
  well if we want to get technical , 34 % of the electorate or 27 % of the people . 
   the uk is honestly a lot poorer than most people realise . 
  london 's monstrous economy really distorts the countries stats . 
  is that really true though ? 
  according to [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gdp-and-beyond/quality-of-life/median-income ) we have a median income pretty much exactly the same as germany . 
  and in any case london and the southeast constitute about 1/3rd of the population, 
  really ? 
  according to [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gdp-and-beyond/quality-of-life/median-income ) we have a median income pretty much exactly the same as germany . 
  just so i 'm clear . 
  how would us contributing to various esa projects make us not independent ? 
  watching it on the news it was said that it is a nice middle option . 
  boats were slow but cheap , planes were fast but expensive , this is in the middle of the two . 
  cheaper than planes , faster than boats . 
  did you not read the article ? 
  there 's a graph the shows the unemployment rate dropping steadily for the last 7 years . 
  does the same apply to france , who on the chart appear to be even more pessimistic ? 
  or germany ( or indeed the eu average ) which only has a 5 % difference ? 
   country that big with less gdp than italy . 
  quite a bit less now . 
  the drop in their gdp ( nominal ) has been astonishing . 
  they now have a gdp approaching that of spain . 
  you got that right . 
  you ca n't move where i work for climate scientists in their ferraris !, 
  that 's what i 'm saying . 
  get in there !, 
  you clearly have a great deal of evidence . 
  you could bust this conspiracy wide open !, 
  shit , you should get in to climate science . 
  you seem to know more than all these so called `` scientists '' . 
  it 's going to happen any way . 
  i work at a company that is a very large publisher ( not elsevier or springer ) and open access is all but seen as an inevitability . 
  it 's just a matter of working out the business of it . 
  if it 's an open journal yes , otherwise you pay to read . 
  i do wonder how common that is . 
  in my current workplace i work 9-5 with an hour for lunch and tea breaks are n't included . 
  that is a few 10 min tea breaks a day are just done during work hours . 
  i 've just signed a contract on a new job and it 's the same . 
  350 million a week at least !, 
   the authority of the parents is paramount and should be respected sounds awful . 
  parent 's should n't have unlimited rights in regards to their children . 
  clearly even you believe that otherwise you 'd be fine with parents josef fritzl-ing their children . 
  children also have their own rights and sometimes those rights need to be protected from their parents . 
  in this case the right to a proper education without their parent 's medieval beliefs getting in the way . 
  i work for a professional body with a royal charter like this . 
  that 's not really the mindset here although maybe it 's different there . 
  you are right though , if nothing else , the samples sizes and data quality seem better with the ons . 
  looking at that page had two interesting points :  42 % of people on `` zero-hours contracts '' worked their usual hours compared with 58 % of other workers not a massive difference and also :  around a third ( 31 % ) of people on `` zero-hours contracts '' want more hours compared with 10 % of people in employment not on a zero-hours contract , though this could be linked to a higher proportion of `` zero-hours contract '' jobs being part-time . 
  looking in more detail , 8 % of people on `` zero-hours contracts '' would like a different job with more hours compared with 1 % for other people in employment ( the remainder would like more hours in their current job or an additional job ) so it seems these jobs are worse than other jobs but if this time we count all the people who want more hours or want a different job as unemployed , that still only increases the unemployment figure by 527000 bringing it up to 6.7 % . 
  the cipd is a chartered institute and registered charity . 
  why do n't you give a single credit to it ? 
  sounds a bit like an [ ad hominem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ad_hominem ) to me . 
  just for the sake of argument , what in particular is wrong with the research ? 
  what have they done wrong ? 
  edit : in any case , the number of zero hour contracts in the uk is about 800,000 . 
  even if you counted them as unemployed that would put the rate only up to about 7.5 % . 
  about the same as ireland . 
  and still lower than the eu average ^ ^ and ^ ^ france, 
  [ sure ] ( http://www2.cipd.co.uk/pressoffice/press-releases/zero-hours-041215.aspx ) from the article :  new survey evidence published today suggests that , on average , zero-hours contract employees experience similar levels of job satisfaction , work-life balance and personal well-being to employees on permanent , full-time contracts . 
  odd . 
  the way that question is phrased does n't really tell you how common domestic violence is . 
  it 's way too muddied by factors like how likely people are to report it , how large your friendship groups are etc etc. 
  it 's almost to the point of it being meaningless . 
  it seems like quite a misleading report . 
  what the original research said was that london ranked 31 out of the 35 cities they chose to look at ( all of which were already nice cities ) below london on the list were paris , milan and rome . 
  when you put it like that i understand . 
  the world is a worrying place right now . 
  fair enough . 
  but certainly not sabotaging for it 's own sake . 
  the uk is voting in it 's own best interest ( i should actually be clear at this point , i 'm pro-eu membership and pro-defence union with certain caveats ) . 
  but so is every other country .
