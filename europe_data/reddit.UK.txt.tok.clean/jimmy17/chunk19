  surely it 's not even worth the paperwork . 
  in fact why is germany spending 1.2 % on denfence when there is no danger ? 
  well at least you 're being honest . 
  your in nato to leech off your allies . 
  so what 's your suggestion then ? 
  force eu countries against their will to join an eu defence pact even if they do n't want to ? 
  how would that work exactly ? 
  would germany and france march in an commandeer polish tanks and irish planes ? 
  you mention below it would be `` a stable , balanced alliance '' . 
  does n't sound like it when your plan relies on a third of the countries being there against their own will . 
   the us spends as much as it does because it chooses to do so . 
  not because there is a necessity . 
  i do actually agree with you there . 
   a country that spends 2 % will still need to get `` bailed out '' by its allies , no matter what . 
  does that not strike you as selfish ? 
  it 's like tax . 
  if i get cancer the state will have to `` bail me out '' , the agreement was that i paid a certain percentage of my income for them to cover me if that situation does arise . 
  you ca n't dodge your taxes then say it does n't matter because if shit does go down even those who paid their full taxes will still need support from the system . 
  what was the point of the european military alliance ? 
  to replace nato ? 
  to freeload off someone else ? 
   only you brits opposed . 
  [ lol , only . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/izr9tih.jpg ) you mean apart from greece , austria , the netherlands , finland , denmark , sweden and ireland . 
  or if you 're talking about the governments and not populations , how about [ lithuania , latvia , estonia and poland . 
  ] ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/eastern-european-countries-oppose-eu-defence-union-army-latvia-2016-9 ) or [ czechia ] ( https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/uk-central-europe-frown-at-juncker-s-european-army/ ) i think you forget / r/europe does not represent the whole of the eu . 
  people may love the idea here but it 's hardly done deal in the eu as a whole . 
  so why be in nato at all then ? 
  well no , that 's why nato exists . 
  so we stand together . 
  but it 's quite selfish to join then not pull your weight whilst expecting the other members to cover your defence . 
  feel free to leave nato if you believe it 's a waste of money . 
  from the article , ** emphasis mine . 
  **  while ** the changes were in line with nato guidelines ** , the committee warned that this `` redefinition '' to some extent undermined the government 's claims that the 2 per cent figure represented a significant increase in defence spending . 
  precisely . 
  these things , whilst highly unpleasant , are also very rare compared to other things . 
  for example , in the last 2.5 years since charlie hebdo , something like 230 people have died from terrorism . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_terrorist_incidents_in_france ) in the same timescale almost 9000 have died in car accidents . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate ), 
  except , like i say , socialism has a very broad definition . 
  take for example the nordic model . 
  it is often referred to as mix of the economics of capitalism and the values of socialism . 
  perhaps corbyn was referring to this when he said `` socialism of the 21st century '' . 
  without context i think it 's you 're getting a bit hysterical to say that corbyn is literally stalin . 
  it 's like the new godwin 's law for some people . 
  or do seriously to believe that corbyn is going to abolish democracy , take control of the means of production and kill millions in the process ? 
  i mean seriously ? 
  on point one , what does that mean specifically ? 
  different people have differing interpretations of socialism . 
  on point two , [ he has .

  `` laymen 's terms '', 
  `` laymen 's terms '', 
   no , its what the mayor of london said . 
  no it 's not . 
  he said part and parcel of living in a major city is being prepared and that we should support the police . 
  the exact quote is : `` part and parcel of living in a great , global city is you 've got to be prepared for these things , you 've got to be vigilant , you 've got to support the police '', 
   vitriolic attacks in 2017 ? 
  give me a fucking break i 'm not sure i understand . 
  you asked `` where does this sort of culture come from ? '', 
  and i 've explained that it has exited in western culture for well over a century . 
  they were in fact quite common in victorian britain . 
  edit : also it is mostly gang related ( with gangs having an over representative number of black and african caribbean men in the uk ) with the main reason being that there is no law in the uk regarding using acid as a weapon so they use it as a legal loophole , i.e. 
  they get lesser sentences if caught vs using another weapon . 
  so i still do n't see why you are so keen to pretend that its all the muslims fault . 
  seems a bit hysterical . 
   evidence of this being asian gangs ? 
  if it was a gang of whites we would already know all about it . 
  so you do n't have any evidence ? 
  regarding your first question are you trying to imply these are muslim or middle eastern gangs ? 
  if so i 'd be happy to see any evidence you have . 
  regarding your second question you should probably read up on the history of acid attacks . 
  they 've been used for hundreds of years in the west and even gave rise to the term `` vitriol '' or `` vitriolic '' to mean a scathing attack ( vitriolic acid being the old name for sulphuric acid . ), 
   you fucking moron . 
  how so ? 
  unsustainable how ? 
  and how does it make society weaker ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  the number i quote are for people who are totally infertile . 
  there are larger numbers for people who have reduced fertility . 
  those couples have about as much chance of conceiving as a gay couple . 
  you said not to exclude them as it 's counterproductive , so surly it applies even more to gay couples who are an even smaller group . 
  it would be counterproductive to exclude gay people from marrying . 
  and according to the ons ( office for national statistics ) here , gay people make up about 1.5 % of the population , infertile women on the other hand make up 6.1 % , infertile men are about the same . 
  so there are about 8 times more infertile people than gay people . 
  and that does n't even include older marriages where people marry after menopause . 
  that being the case , surely the argument `` it would be counterproductive to exclude such a small minority '' applies even more so to gay couples ? 
  what benefits are you referring to ? 
  would say that infertile people should not be given the same benefits ? 
  what about couples who marry later in life so can no longer safely have children ? 
   - near friends oppinions ( should we punish them for not accepting ? 
  ) ,  - family attitude ( the same ) , why would we punish anyone for not accepting ? 
  and how is this at all different from straight marriages ? 
  plenty of straight marriages do n't get approval from friends or family . 
  how would this be any different that , say a family not accepting a mixed race marriage , or a marriage outside of ones religion ? 
  in this respect gay marriage will be identical . 
   - government/law , of course it should be legally identical . 
  why would n't it be ? 
   - church acceptance , the church can accept it if they want or not . 
  this has no bearing on legal marriage .
