  for example , we allow jewish people to get married , but we do n't force christian churches to hold jewish ceremonies . 
   - lower taxes for families , - lower taxes for families that have children . 
  well this goes back to legal equality , so yes , the tax implications for gay marriage should be identical . 
  why not ? 
   until all men learn how to behave interesting idea . 
  i recall reading an article at some point about how black people were also more likely to commit crimes in sweden ( by some proportion versus white people ) . 
  i suppose by that logic emma knyckare would also be in favour of organising a `` whites only '' music festival `` until black people learn how to behave '', 
  good . 
  what 's happened on those islands is a disgrace . 
  [ and in the uk this week . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-40364632 ), 
  one correction  they usually happen in what , 5 year cycles , but the pm can call an early one at any time this is n't really true . 
  the fixed term parliament act set the standard term as 5 years , but to call an early election you need a two-thirds majority vote in the house of commons . 
  absolutely . 
  they 're also recounting kensington and chelsea for a 3rd time as the vote is supposedly within a margin of a dozen or so . 
  except for two major problems . 
  you 'd have to work the equivalent of an extra half day every week and even worse , my birthday will always be on a tuesday ( or second day of the week , whatever its called ) . 
  well then the question gets even more difficult if even the people who want it ca n't agree on what form it should take . 
  i imagine there will be a eu military at some point but i doubt it will be as simple as one springing up as soon as the uk has left . 
  well from what i 've seen the uk is the most opposed to the idea but [ by no means the only country opposed to it . 
  ] ( https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20170524/460c8e1363f5dee25bc24bc37c3f57a9.jpg ) you 'll also need to persuade ireland , denmark , austria , sweden and your own country , finland . 
  you heard him lads . 
  get the spitfires up . 
   so there should be men in uniform knocking on your door , taking away your children and throwing you into jail , because you do n't give your children a certain kind of preventative medicine ? 
  or to rephrase : so there should be [ police ] knocking on your door , taking away your children and throwing you into jail , because you [ commit child abuse ] . 
  erm , yes . 
  yes i do think that sounds like a good idea . 
  well , yes , but i was n't responding to the article . 
  i was responding to the comment above which implied an upper limit was placed on models as well by taking a quote out of context . 
  that would n't really prove that * most athletes * have an unhealthy bmi . 
  well yeah , the article says they use bmi as the measure but where does it say that there will be an upper limit ? 
  all it says is . 
   but the final version , backed by mps 2015 , allows doctors to decide whether a model is too thin by taking into account their weight , age , and body shape . 
  [ does n't seem too different to me . 
  ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/obese.jpg ) 24 % in france to 28 % in the uk . 
  i see more overweight models that i do anorexic ones . 
  i see stuff like [ this ] ( http://files2.coloribus.com/files/adsarchive/part_676/6761955/file/dove-skin-firming-range-linda-small-86685.jpg ) all the time . 
  but i do n't think i 've ever seen an advert or poster with an anorexic in it . 
   most athletes have an unhealthy bmi do you have a source ? 
   main topic in foreign medias it really is n't . 
  in fact this is the first i heard of it . 
  ticks all around !, 
  i do n't think you understand . 
  [ tick .

   do n't be destructive , be constructive . 
  well how about you take a leaf out of your own book and do just that ? 
  show us where bobleejagger was wrong using an actual argument rather than posting smug comments and putting another tick in your `` internet arguments won '' log book . 
  i 'm not sure being smug and condescending is an actual argument . 
  well that 's bullshit . 
  i go to imperial college in london . 
  known for taking on a huge proportion of overseas students compared to other unis . 
  the number of uk students here is 70 % to 30 % overseas . 
  godwined !, 
  take that logic !, 
  a man can dream . 
  i think the olympics were planned before the riots . 
  i 'm not sure why it happened to you hear , i have lived in london for 26 years ( read : my whole life ) and have never had my bag searched on the street . 
  it only ever really happens in museums and airports in which case it has been about the same in every country i have ever been to except maybe japan . 
  [ edgy . 
  ] ( http://forum.idle-games.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2102&amp;d=1340035556 ), 
  nope , still having trouble . 
  i have no fucking clue what you 're on about . 
  not ruling the world = small roads . 
  got it . 
  [ no ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arm_architecture ) [ i ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_sea_oil ) [ guess ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rolls-royce_plc ) [ you ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bae_systems ) [ are ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glaxosmithkline ) [ right . 
  it 's both these days but it is apparently going to be renamed elizabeth tower . 
  if only the greek government did do as the germans did . 
  the problem is women are very capable of serving in the military . 
  sure men are on average stronger but you dont need to be strong to push a button , or make dinner or direct a plane in to land . 
  so many things that women can do . 
  in fact you even admit this much in you last paragraph when you say that you can often work in the civil service . 
  israel has no problem with this . 
  why should any other country ? 
  in my opinion it is simply a throwback to a sexist past . 
  had men had a movement as effective as feminism then this may not have been the case . 
  hopefully it will cease to be the case in future . 
  huh , see there was me working off this oed definition : `` prejudice , stereotyping , or discrimination , typically [ but note not exclusively ] against women , on the basis of sex '' so yeah , i guess you 're wrong . 
  is that not considered horribly sexist ? 
  out of interest is it just for men ? 
  do women have to do service ? 
  stand back everybody , smacksaw is doing science up in here !, 
  as a british guy i sometimes understand americans . 
  it is most definitely not decriminalised in the uk . 
  why would you say it was either ? 
  they are on the continent and share many deep historical and cultural ties with europe . 
  i know there would be a lot to overcome but look how dramatically europe has changed in the last 100 years . 
  i would n't say it was beyond the realm of possibility . 
  also the question has been asked before in the eu and while russia has no intention of joining numerous politicians have spoken about the possibility of them joining . 
  i totally agree with that . 
  when i say `` if certain social and political reforms could be achieved '' i suppose it does n't really indicate the scale of the problems to be overcome . 
  personally i think it would be brilliant if certain social and political reforms could be achieved . 
  russia is massive in population , resources and land and we currently buy huge amounts of power from them . 
  i think joining the eu with the free trade and political and economic stability would be beneficial to everyone . 
  i 'm a fan of the eu to be honest and i would love to see it succeed . 
  i am a bit sick of the anti-german conspiracy theorist in the paper suggesting that the germans are using this as an escuse to take control of the euro-zone !, 
  it was the greek government who fucked up and the germans are putting in a lot of effort to save them . 
  as a brit i 'd like to put in my vote to kick out greece until they get their shit together . 
  that 's true . 
  whilst i think it is sharia law is ridiculous and should never be implemented in the europe how on earth do you know they are on benefits or have fled from anywhere ?
