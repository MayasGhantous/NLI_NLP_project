  of course not . 
  he 's too busy twirling his evil moustache and tying a maiden to a set of train tracks . 
  no worries . 
  apologies if i caused any offence . 
  fair enough . 
  but i simply wrote a joke about it and you seemed to take it very seriously . 
  not really , we are basically at `` full employment . '', 
  which i think means it 's actually beneficial to have workers coming in from overseas to fill the gaps . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  potentially fucked up . 
  it 's very hard to say what the ottomans would have done if we had given them a full refund / delivered the ships . 
  what if the ottomans had gone to war with us anyway ? 
  it would have been far more of a fuck up to allow the delivery of 2 world class battleships / hand them a fuck load of cash to a country that you declare war against a few days later . 
  on the balance of things i think war with the ottomans was inevitable . 
  i think we are looking at this with the benefit of hindsight to be honest . 
  it 's not hard to see why the british though it was a sound military decision at the time .

  bugger . 
  that one went over my head . 
  victim ? 
  i know americans are n't really known for their sense of humour but blimey . 
  you are taking this all a bit too seriously . 
  well only for one of the ships . 
   at the same time the british also took over a second ottoman battleship , a king george v class-derived vessel being built by vickers -- re\u015fadiye -- which was renamed hms erin . 
  ** such an action was allowed for in the contracts ** , as first lord of the admiralty winston churchill did not want to risk the ships being used against the british the ottoman empire was negotiating an alliance with the germans which was ratified only 4 days after the seizure of the ships at the same time that they had ordered a battleship from the uk with a clause in the contract that said they could seize the ship without a refund if it was necessary to protect british interests . 
  theft by the british or unbelievable incompetence by the ottomans ? 
  how could it have prevented them ? 
  the ships were seized 4 days before the ottoman -- german alliance was ratified . 
  do you think their decision to go war could have swung so dramatically and so late in the proceedings ? 
  not giving wads of cash to your enemies in a war in unjustified enrichment ? 
  apologies , i should have been clearer . 
  britain was already at war at that point . 
  that is the war i 'm referring to . 
  and the war with the ottomans was inevitable at that point so why would we hand them massive wads of cash ? 
  i mean they ratified their alliance with the germans within about 4 days of the ships being seized . 
  this was a treaty that was being discussed quite some time before the war broke out . 
  their alliance with germany was inevitable . 
  edit : in fact for one of the battlehips it was even in the fucking contract we signed with the ottomans . 
  so you 'd also have to explain how invoking a clause in a contract that the ottomans signed is theft . 
  more like incompetence on their part to be honest . 
  they were negotiating an alliance with the germans at the same time that they had ordered a battleship from the uk with a clause in the contract that said they could seize the ship without a refund if it was necessary to protect british interests . 
   at the same time the british also took over a second ottoman battleship , a king george v class-derived vessel being built by vickers -- re\u015fadiye -- which was renamed hms erin . 
  such an action was allowed for in the contracts , as first lord of the admiralty winston churchill did not want to risk the ships being used against the british you response to all this is they were stealing ? 
  that 's breathtakingly naive !, 
  edit 2 : added some detail . 
  and at a time when it was almost inevitable that they would join the war . 
  the ships were seized 4 days before a treaty that led to the ottomans joining the war was ratified . 
  a treaty that inevitable would have been discussed for a while . 
  fallacies like equating the seizure of materiel during wartime with theft ? 
  that 's nothing . 
  look at all the other naughty things we did during the world wars : ~ ~ the dday landings ~ ~ trespassing ~ ~ breaking enigma ~ ~ breaking data privacy laws ~ ~ bombing ~ ~ vandalism ~ ~ hitting enemy soldiers ~ ~ assault ~ ~ killing enemy soldiers ~ ~ murder !, 
  ~ ~ capturing enemy soldiers ~ ~ kidnapping ~ ~ capturing materiel ~ ~ more stealing !, 
  guess we should have mailed off a cheque for that as well , huh ? 
  but why ? 
  we were at war with them . 
  should we have also mailed off a cheque whenever materiel was captured on the battlefield . 
  i can feel the bitterness in your comments . 
  did someone from the uk do something to upset you ? 
  i guess it depends on the feminists though . 
  they were n't too happy when [ erin pizzey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erin_pizzey ) tried to open up male domestic abuse centres in the uk . 
  i read elsewhere that there was another brit ( apart from the one that was shot ) who was also involved in subduing the at attacker and got slashed with a knife . 
  [ oed definition number 3  ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/swarm )  a large number of people or things or as a verb :  move somewhere in large numbers how terribly dehumanising . 
  not sure you read the crime one but london is actually 28 on the list . 
  and was ranked safer than ( among many others ) lausanne , sofia , athens , milan , brussels , dublin , rome , paris , turin etc etc [ using the same website as the crime one ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/pollution/region_rankings.jsp?title=2015-mid&amp;region=150 ) ( because your pollution link is meaningless in isolation ) london has lower pollution levels than 38 cities including rotterdamn , budapest , madrid , athens , sofia , paris , antwerp , marseilles , rome , turin etc etc. 
  [ as for population density , london is n't even in the top 10 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_union_cities_proper_by_population_density ) it seems you just do n't like big cities , rather than not liking london specifically . 
  well that can only go well ca n't it . 
   was willing to give back the falklands well he 's lost me there . 
  why do the falkland islanders deserve to be fucked over like that ? 
  well that 's a little shameful . 
  the gini coefficient for the uk is approaching that of the usa . 
  it was actually a bit odd . 
  they are a one party communist state and you do see hammer and sickles about the place but honestly , it did n't feel very communist ( whatever that is ) . 
  there did n't seem to be much government interference in peoples lives and there seemed to be many thriving industries . 
  i ca n't say where they intend to go politically but if i had to classify what i saw and understood as an outsider , i 'd say they were technically communist but quite moderate . 
  but like i say , this is my understanding as an outsider . 
  edit : i have also spent some time in china and i did feel more of an atmosphere of government surveillance and interference in people 's lives . 
  vietnam seemed quite distinct from that . 
  i just came back from a month and a half in vietnam . 
  they are great people . 
  so friendly and welcoming . 
  you could also see everywhere that they were working hard to build their country and whilst there are still some raw wounds from the past , they do n't appear to hold a grudge to anyone . 
  i 'm glad to hear of this deal and hope it brings prosperity to both sides . 
  well , not burning per se but the process of steam reforming does produce co2 . 
  the thing is it is far better to produce it in a factory because it is more efficient and the pollution can be dealt with far more efficiently . 
  i 've been t the states a few times . 
  timing wise it 's never been that bad . 
  it only takes a few minutes longer to go in the nudie scanner and then get touched up by some overly serious tsa agent . 
  skylon is incredible . 
  from zero to hypersonic speeds all from one engine . 
  and it can both airbreath by condensing o2 out of the air as well as keep a tank of o2 on board for getting in to space . 
  except this is a `` tax '' only one gender pays and only those of certain religions . 
  make it equitable and i might agree with you . 
  as an outsider i 've always quite liked merkel . 
  how is she viewed in germany ?
