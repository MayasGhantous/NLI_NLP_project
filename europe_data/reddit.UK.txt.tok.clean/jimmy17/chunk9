  it exists for people to use it . 
  but that 's literally how taper relief on iht is meant to work . 
  he paid the taxes was required to by law . 
  he was n't even using a cheeky interpretation of it . 
  this is literally how taper relief works and what thousands of people do every year . 
  there are many reasons to dislike cameron . 
  this is reaching pretty hard . 
  he did . 
  montezuma is also pretty good . 
  not to be crass but that must have smelt amazing . 
  you seem to have missed the point of what i was saying . 
  i was calling him a hypocrite , not critiquing any one of those points . 
  but in fairness posting the whole quote seems to actually support what i 'm saying . 
  if he believes that simply following the law is not enough for you to be left alone by the government , if you must also follow british values like fair play then why does he get to be left alone regarding his family 's tax avoidance ? 
  after all , `` for too long , we have been a passively tolerant society , saying to our citizens ` as long as you obey the tax laws , we will leave you alone ' etc etc, 
  you 're the only one who has mentioned internet history . 
  there are many ways in which this could be hypocritical . 
  be it his party and him often using the `` if you 've got nothing to hide , you 've got nothing to fear '' justification . 
  some of his mps have actually used this verbatim . 
  or him calling out jimmy carr and saying that he should come out and make his dodgy tax avoidance arrangements public . 
  or his classic quote :  for too long , we have been a passively tolerant society , saying to our citizens ` as long as you obey the law , we will leave you alone ', 
  yeah , he really should be living in fear . 
  true , but they are still several orders of magnitude more dangerous . 
  huh ? 
  there are 5 in the top 25 , 4 of which are in the uk . 
  depends where . 
  i know that in some countries and several states of the us , if the father is unmarried his options are extremely limited in preventing his child from being adopted . 
  if he is not on the birth certificate , his options are essentially nil . 
  ~ ~ nottingham ~ ~ shotingham . 
  i doubt that . 
  lest democratic in what way ? 
  [ this index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index#democracy_index_by_country_.282015.29 ) puts us 16th in the world . 
  in europe this places us above spain , italy , czech republic , belgium , france , portugal , slovenia , lithuania , greece ... etc. 
  now we 're talking . 
  all you need now is a bit of marmite . 
  ok , lets compare . 
  the uk is 87 % white . 
  compare that to the usa it has roughly the same white population as oregon , colorado , kansas , wisconsin and kentucky . 
  homicide rates per 100 k uk : 1 oregon : 2 colorado : 2.3 kansas : 3.5 wisconsin : 2.7 kentucky : 4.5 so comparing states with similar white populations the us still has a murder rate between 2 and 4.5 times higher .

  sounds like bullshit to me . 
  i completed my phd in chemistry a few years ago . 
  among other reasons , i did n't stay in science because the pay is crap . 
  the same went for a lot of my friends . 
  at the same time the university i was at was struggling to fit in all the undergraduates who comfortably met the entry requirements and wanted to study chemistry . 
  they were 200 undergraduate chemists ( up from 90 when i was an undergrad ) and i understand all the nearby universities were having the same issue . 
  sounds like a load of companies just do n't want to pay more for te good grads . 
   so much that i remember to look for the star mark every time a statistic comes up haha , me too . 
  then i look up the actual number and mentally edit it in . 
  i believe our december unemployment rate was at ~ 4.8 % . 
  incidentally this would put the uk below malta and within 0.3 % of the lowest in europe . 
  funny thing is , this graph is showing data three months older than the other countries ( i 'm not sure why ) . 
  if you were to put the actual december data on , the uk is actually around 4.8 % . 
  this would put the uk below malta and within 0.3 % of the lowest in europe . 
  conversely it was in the news a few months ago that the uk employment rate is at the highest level since records began . 
   i mean , its shit . 
  but you can grow it . 
  not sure where you got that from . 
  english white and sparkling wines are very well regarded and have won quite a few awards . 
   temperature increases have even stopped for the last 20 years , nope . 
  [ from wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_warming_hiatus )  a july 2015 paper on the updated noaa dataset cast doubt on the existence of this supposed hiatus , and found no indication of a slowdown even in the previous years . 
  [ 10 ] [ 11 ] this analysis incorporated the latest corrections for known biases in ocean temperature measurements , and new land temperature data . 
  scientists working on other datasets welcomed this study , though the view was expressed that the short term warming trend had been slower than in previous periods of the same length . 
  [ 12 ] a review of scientific literature by bristol university in november 2015 found `` no substantive evidence '' of a pause in global warming . 
  [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  independent of these discussions about data and measurements for earlier years , 2015 turned out to be much warmer than any of the earlier years , already before el ni\u00f1o conditions started . 
  the warmth of 2015 largely ended any remaining scientific credibility of `` the hiatus '', 
  read the axis . 
  the uk was in the loosing minority 13 % of the time . 
  that means it was voting with the majority 87 % of the time . 
  and that 's only since 2009 . 
  so since the start of the debt/migration/other crises lurched between in the last few years . 
  voting against some of the nonsense that has been going down i think was a good idea . 
  before all the crises [ we were even lower ] ( http://imgur.com/y6pc9nr.jpg ) . 
  below austria and within a percent of germany , denmark and poland . 
  voting with the eu 87 % of the time = refusing to cooperate . 
  odd definition . 
  refuge . 
  as in spaces for people being abused . 
  not refugee . 
  yup . 
  and in the uk , we have the situation where there are [ 7,500 refuge spaces that are for women only and only 60 for men .

   replace `` perceived to be terrible '' with `` whose main claim to fame is being terrible '' and yes , that 'd be my thoughts main claim to fame by whom ? 
  rhodes here is mostly known for being a diamond magnate and big supporter of the cape to cairo railway . 
  i would bet most people do n't know the bullshit he did . 
  so by your own argument the statue should remain . 
  just like the napoleon ones remain in paris . 
   the majority of the people talking about are british . 
  it was started by a student from southern africa on a `` rhodes scholarship '' ironically enough . 
  ( hence me asking if it should be taken down if i was in paris on a scholarship ( lets call it a napoleon scholarship ) ) most of the student body/country/admin , disagree . 
  by you own argument that means the statue should stay . 
  not really that different . 
  rhodes is only one or two generations n from the napoleonic wars . 
  not inconceivable that his grandfather fought . 
  but in any case i 'm not sure i get the logic . 
  150 year old atrocities = pull down the statue . 
  200 year old atrocities = totally fine . 
  so your argument is not that we should take down historical statues and monuments for horrible people , but we should take down historical statues and monuments for people who are perceived to be terrible ? 
  how does someone like columbus fall into that ? 
  he is perceived by most to be the guy who discovered america and that 's about it .
