  nothing is worse than first past the post . 
  i 'd love for you to explain how av is worse . 
  av is n't much of an improvement to fptp , but it 's still better . 
  `` hi , would you like to make your country more democratic by having a more representative voting system ? '', 
  `` no thanks ! '', 
  - british people, 
  british people are dumb and cowardly , they will win with fear , just like always . 
  what they did there was technically illegal , if yes had done something like that in some way you can be damh sure westminster would have nulled the vote , but who holds them to account ? 
  because britain . 
  we fucked up a few things , including failure to metricate , and our rail dominance turned to shit . 
  now we have high prices , lacklustre service , and we have to import our rolling stock , infrastructure , and expertise from deutschland . 
  in scotland we recently awarded our rail franchise to a dutch company and we 're all hoping they can deliver the continental service they promise . 
  wish i could use trains more often but they are expensive . 
   the us probably paid for most of it and it looks fucking amazing . 
  it 's a shame we will have to blow it up before ( temporarily ) retreating behind europe 's best anti tank obstacle . 
  ~ ~ the english channel ~ ~ ** la manche ** ftfy !!, 
  i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  actually that 's completely different . 
  britain is an abbreviation of the counties name as a whole . 
  great britain is the island . 
  `` i am from britain '' could be taken as any where in the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland . 
  to specifically exclude ni is when the term `` great britain '' us used , such as `` team gb '' . 
  team gb is not an acceptable name for our olympic and paralympic teams and should never have been chosen for such a purpose . 
   ** from my perspective ** the mood in scotland would have been to become a republic . 
  of those i campaigned with for a yes vote the mood was very much for a republic . 
  from those i spoke to gathered in george square the mood was very much for a republic . 
  further to this keep in mind that a debate on the monarchy has never been had , support for scottish independence went from 20 % to 45 % when the country was actively engaged in thinking about it . 
  / u/eean makes a good point . 
  ratification of the constitution was to require a public vote . 
  so there was scope to remove or add things before it was passed into law . 
  no , not in my experience . 
  the snp supported retaining the monarchy but in no way were they against the idea of getting rid of them . 
  it was more a `` lets talk if '' kind of issue . 
  no point adding more issues to a referendum than need be . 
  from my perspective the mood in scotland would have been to become a republic . 
  i do n't think the monarchy would ever have made it as far as the constitution had we voted yes . 
  i disput the idea that most scots who support independence , or even most snp supporters , are monarchist . 
  the snp leadership maintain that position in order to not rock the boat . 
  most people i campaigned with are openly for a scottish republic . 
  the scottish greens , solidarity , and ssp support a republic . 
  if scotland had voted yes i do n't think the monarchy would ever have made the as far as the constitution . 
  sorry bud , but turkey exploited a political situation to make a land grab . 
  then sought to resettle a population there . 
  it was entirely unacceptable . 
  i appreciate that many have made a life there now , but the military occupation must end . 
  i denounce this new micro state and it 's assertion that it is in any way pro-people . 
  a monarchy is a undemocratic no matter how it is dressed up . 
  brit here , give me another eu passport and throw us out !, 
  i think it probably stems from capitulation in the second world war , but the iraq war certainly revived the view . 
  it 's certainly still a misguided view even in relation to the second world war . 
  i do n't see it that way at all . 
  we want the powers delivered at the level promised . 
  this has to be delivered . 
  other than that we want a better government for all of the uk . 
  the tories have been awful for everyone , i want everyone to see the back of their policies . 
  i guess an easier way to put it is this , we want the snp to make labour labour again . 
  they pretty much announce they had changed their mind two hours after the results were in . 
  the problem is they promised everything from federalism to nothing specific depending on who was asked . 
  nobody has a clue what they meant by `` more powers '' . 
  what we are getting is a range of pretty meaningless powers from the smith commission . 
  the snp , and scots in general , want more than what is coming . 
  not a chance in hell . 
  the reason scotland `` has a hateboner '' for scottish labour is due in part to the fact they were perceived as being in bed with the tories over the referendum . 
  the snp would never , ever , aid a tory government . 
  nicola sturegon has said that she supports voting reform , she has also said that if her party gains most of the seats in scotland that this is actually due to the flawed system we have and that regardless of the benefit it has given she supports that system being changed as a matter of principle . 
  because our voting system sucks . 
  the snp are polling well so if change is what you want giving them your vote is the most effective way to endorse change . 
  we should have a voting system that lets you express your view on all candidates and not just one . 
  i would say that power as local as possible is a good thing . 
  with england however keep in mind they are a block of 50m where as scotland is a block of 5m . 
  it makes sense for england to break down into devolved regions if they are to have the same effect as a scottish parliament . 
  i do n't see a need for some kind of island parliaments for scotland , power should just be handed to local councils where appropriate . 
  i support the idea of scottish mps having no say in matters that effect only england , but i do n't see a single parliament for england as a sensible approach . 
  either have regional assemblies or simply keep westminster but discount non-english mp votes . 
  it has to be thought out though , since some matters that would appear to be `` english '' may have knock on effects in devolved areas . 
  if the uk votes to leave but the scottish electorate voted to stay in then in my view that is justification for a second independence referendum . 
  the ( false ) argument made was `` we 're safer in europe if we stay together '' and if two years later we are facing a brexit when the scottish electorate voted against it then the people of scotland deserve to have the chance to change their mind on the union . 
  it 's because france would n't assist america in it 's imperialist oil wars . 
  apparently following international law is a cowardly thing to do . 
  i do n't follow . 
  ugh , the only good thing about that movie was the blonde girl . 
  let 's not . 
  britain is so incompetent we ca n't even get a territory to secede properly !, 
  always had a few irish in my class at uni who moved to the uk and then constantly complain about how we 're all murdering bastards and scum . 
  why the fuck did they move here !? 
  why !? 
  even the other irish could n't stand those guys . 
  you could n't be more incorrect . 
  when top gear started it was very different , and was a factual show about cars . 
  what we have now is clearly an entertainment show with a car theme . 
  even when they are talking cars what they are saying if often not factual . 
  it appears you are correct , my apologies . 
  you probably be surprised at how few countries support dual nationality . 
  ~ ~ if you want uk citizenship for example you also need to renounce any exiting citizenship . 
  there are a few exceptions to this though , for example due to the [ `` good friday agreement '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/good_friday_agreement ) residents in northern ireland are free to consider themselves british , irish , or both and hold both nationalities if they choose . ~ ~ edit : it appears i was talking utter mince , apologies . 
  see m2ys4u 's reply below . 
  also https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship, 
  i had a 3 representative accuse me of `` just wanting to moan '' after i called with a complaint . 
  this is probably the best customer service i have ever had from a mobile company .
