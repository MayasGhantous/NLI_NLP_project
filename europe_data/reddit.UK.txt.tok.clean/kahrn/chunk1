apparently they have deleted similar posts in the past , so i have a feeling they have gone and done it again . 
  this is misleading , as everyone in the uk drinks ( dirty , dirty ) cider , and everyone in france drinks wine !, 
  nothing about frogs legs , eh ? 
  with trump on the way , i 'd argue everyone is going to like the chinese a lot more in the coming years . 
  we imported and exported so many things during colonization , so we ended up with a completely multi-cultural dishes that have been adapted over time . 
  nobody has an english dinner everyday . 
  they have dishes that were adapted from various parts of the world . 
  as a result i would say we got a pretty good deal . 
  that and we have some of the greatest chefs in the world . 
  we can not show weakness to france with their frogs legs and snails , god forbid . 
  that 's sort of my point . 
  muslim 's out of warzones ( in our own domestic countries ) can be converted at any point . 
  it 's impossible to really put an estimate on something like that . 
  did anyone predict the glasgow preacher from yesterday would come out and support the belgium attacks , despite the fact he was a seemingly normal muslim ? 
  nope . 
  do we know if he merely supports the attacks , or would act on his beliefs ? 
  not for sure ... 
  this man is just one example that came out of nowhere , we ( at least , the general public ) have no idea how many people have these beliefs and how many out of those would act on them . 
  that 's one of the many problems i see with determining any sort of statistic . 
  not / u/postingfrommytoilet but i can say the 99.999 % is completely made up ( as most statistics are !, 
   a quick google suggests isis members are at around 16-32k ( lets say ~ 24k ) . 
  the taliban grows in strength by around double every 3-4 years ( currently ~ 60,000 , but not everyone in the taliban would actually commit a terrorist act ... ) , al-qaeda ( ~ 29k ) , the list of groups could go on ... but yeah ... certainly not 99.999 % . 
  given that muslims in western nations like my own ( as happened yesterday in scotland ) come out and support these attacks , even though they were deemed non-extremist literally * hours/days * before , then one can presume putting a figure on this sort of thing would be * pretty fucking difficult * . 
  and then one has to also now figure out if this person is a threat that would act on their beliefs , or is just full of it and will never act upon them . 
  which is pretty much impossible on a global scale . 
  so i guess the truth is * we have no idea * . 
  it 's not like a conventional army , and people can make ( to the outside observer anyway ) rapid decisions that could lead to extremism . 
  putting an actual figure on something like this may as well be as reliable as putting a figure on how many people * might believe in the tooth fairy * , and how many people actually * put a tooth under the pillow * . 
  that said i know nothing , and would be interested to see an actual calculated figure from someone that knows their shit . 
  also my analogy is really shitty , and i 'm aware of that -- although i 'd be interested to know the statistics behind the tooth fairy too . 
  infact -- they 'd probably be more reliable . 
  ** tldr : ** ~ 0.0015 % -99.995 % . 
  * maybe * . 
  shitting coins . 
  rare form of welsh diarrhea . 
  did n't kimmy live , and go to a college in sweden ? 
  i could n't comment on any trade deal , but do you seriously think trump gives a shit about the common man in the uk , or any country in the eu ? 
  not to mention that `` brexiteers '' will never win as they are divided themselves , ranging from full nazi , to just `` well , i was n't sure what to vote !, 
  '' , to the ones that were simply manipulated by the media . 
  * but at the same time * , people in the eu would be foolish to think right wing values will not rise , and this has been iterated over and over -- but a lot of people ignored it as they did with brexit , as they did with trump , and as they will now proceed to do in some areas of europe . 
  did it ? 
  i thought the general consensus was it was supported by [ insert government here ] and was far more complex than a few guys in a cave . 
   imagine economic sanctions comparable to the russian one ? 
  yeah , that sort of shit would destroy the eu from the inside . 
  there is no way the uk would be out of the top 10 world economies within the next decade either . 
  if we 're throwing out crazy predictions then it 'd probably be more likely that the eu collapses within such a timeframe ( the eu is still relatively new -- not saying it will , just saying it 'd be more likely than your scenario ) . 
   noone cares if you leave , noone bats an eye about what is up with britain after the brexit . 
  the headline of this article is a quote from a german minister saying the exact opposite . 
  that the eu needs to play close attention , `` or eu is in ` deep trouble ' '' . 
  brexit sucks , but to deny it would have an effect on the eu would be a bit ignorant/misinformed . 
  people absolutely do care , both in britain and in the eu , and you can be damn sure that both the eu and uk will be affected . 
  also , as a british person , personally i do n't think we are `` better than the rest '' , or that we need special treatment . 
  theresa is watching over us now , we 'll be fine !, 
  it 'll be like a digital nudist party . 
  privacy was over rated anyway . 
  i know , but it is another silly `` punishment '' . 
  punishing countries has n't always worked out so good historically , and the idea you need to `` punish '' nations that have a democracy in order to preserve the eu just seems silly , if not dangerous . 
  a lot of people seem to be calling for a `` flood '' of `` refugees '' to be unleashed on the uk as a * punishment * . 
  like seriously , what the actual fuck . 
  we 're talking about * shipping humans like cattle as punishment * . 
  that will be a very dangerous path to go down and will only result in violence , death , and the rise of the far-right . 
  eh , if you build a nuke that does n't work as designed then it would potentially kill innocent people , or fail to detonate when we might actually * genuinely * need it ( hopefully never given m.a.d but still , dumb idea , especially if the other nation found out your nukes were actually just entirely fake ) . 
  it 'd be insanity in both examples . 
  the other reply seems to disagree with that on the basis that nato has been pushing for english though . 
  despite the fact our own meps require translations . 
  thanks . 
  a decent reply - but the other answers seem to be in conflict . 
  an opt-in system like this surely would n't be compatible with the reply provided by / u/error _ correction below ? 
  sadly my question is just getting downvoted as well and i 'm only left more confused . 
  thats reddit for you :(, 
    each military has their own standards ,  nope . 
  nato saw to that . 
  yes but we 're talking about creating a unified force . 
  different militaries use different uniforms , guns , vehicles , etc. . . 
  i ca n't imagine the entire of the eu adopting the challenger 2 tank , given that germany produces its own leopard , or the l85 rifle , etc. . . 
  it would be a nightmare . 
    not to mention you do not want to be dealing with language difficulties while out in the field  again , nato has been pushing english integration . 
  pushing and achieving are entirely different things . 
  we have entire communities of people that can barely speak english in * england * . 
  people even require translations in eu parliament !, 
  it will not work and it will get people killed . 
    and the fact managing an entire army is difficult enough when it is one nation , and the fact it would take many years , if not decades to be functional at a huge expense , all while likely increasing global tensions as a result , for what gain ? 
   and when we 're a bunch of allies , barely capable of handling anything on our own , like we did in libya , it 's better ? 
  name a war that * was * handled well ? 
  certainly not one recently despite the us being the main force behind most and i 'm 100 % sure the us , uk or france will handle war better than the eu `` army '' by virtue of the fact they have had extensive training and been around for a ** lot ** longer than the eu has even existed . 
   and what is this about increasing global tensions ? 
  the eu is very young and rapidly changing . 
  people question the decisions being made already . 
  throw a military into that and tensions will rise globally , and obviously russia would have concerns . 
    just why does the eu need a military and is it really worth it ? 
  serious question . 
   because expecting romania and bulgaria to have competent militaries with their size , is laughable nobody is expecting that , but they should have their own forces that reflect their gdp . 
  who even knows which nations will , or will not be part if the eu in half a century , or if it even exists ? 
  they should have their own forces to combat changing global situations . 
  regardless the size is n't going to make much difference . 
  what makes a difference is having a nuclear weapon . 
  it is nothing but a dangerous pipe dream and a recipe for disaster . 
  i sure hope not . 
  i did use the word `` rationalize '' at the end for a very good reason . 
  to do nothing would be incredibly irrational .
