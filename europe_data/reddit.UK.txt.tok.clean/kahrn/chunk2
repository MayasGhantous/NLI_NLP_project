  the last word in my post is `` rationalize '' and yet you decided to make a sweeping judgement ( or `` translation '' ) that fits your own agenda . 
  people need to calm down and stop making flawed `` translations '' in order for us to act properly . 
  to do nothing would be incredibly irrational , and it is the people twisting words with `` translations '' and the media that are causing many of the issues in the world . 
  as if enough were not already made . 
  incredible . 
  maybe we really are fucked . 
  how would a european army even work ? 
  each military has their own standards , not to mention you do not want to be dealing with language difficulties while out in the field . . and the fact managing an entire army is difficult enough when it is one nation , and the fact it would take many years , if not decades to be functional at a huge expense , all while likely increasing global tensions as a result , for what gain ? 
  just * why * does the eu need a military and is it really worth it ? 
  serious question . 
  along with the pregnant woman killed earlier by the syrian immigrant , this really is n't looking good at all . 
  regardless of past , present or future attacks , we must stand strong . 
  we must not let these attacks degrade our humanity or ability to rationalize . 
  ** edit ** : how the fuck anyone could misread this as `` not taking action '' given my post history , flair and given the last word is ** rationalize ** is astounding . 
  to not take action would be ** irrational ** , as would making it based upon only recent emotion . 
  islamic law would probably state his death * as * the trial . 
  now he gets the mystery box or the women or whatever the fuck it even is these days . 
  no need to bring us into it dude . . / r/europe is already filled with crap about brexit . 
  you 're literally suggesting a pregnant woman deserved to be stabbed because she could not defend herself . . ? 
  it is n't a suggestion at all . 
  it is a factual statement . 
  stabbings happen literally happen every few minutes on a national level depending on which nation you live in . 
  it would be * abnormal * if those stabbings suddenly stopped , for instance . 
  it 's obviously shitty to say `` stabbings are normal '' but it is no real different from saying `` violent crime is normal '' aside from not specifying the method ofc . . 
  there is also absolutely no way the german public deserve to have pregnant women stabbed on the streets for attempting to help others either . . 
  ok . well thanks for a reasonable explanation , 
  no , and it annoys me that people will judge it that way in such a negative way when i am attempting to ask a question . 
  i am simply asking a question as to how terrorism affects * both * economies . 
  terrorist attacks at such frequency can not be good for either . 
  i 'm kind of slightly annoyed that people are judging my comment that way , as i imagine if i had a different flair it would have been judged differently . 
  my thoughts go out to both france and germany but please do n't twist my words . 
  to all the people voting him down : remember this ... 
  when all hope seems lost , and the world seems in chaos , the worlds appears to be falling apart , and you slowly creep into the realization that your dreams are falling apart , that your nation is falling into the abyss ... 
  remember that we walked away from the most brutal war humanity ever witnessed , entered a period of extreme tensions , and were prepared for complete and utter mutual annihilation . 
  we did terrible things , and terrible things happened . 
  we survived . 
  but to quote neil degrasse tyson -- `` we found the time to start thinking about earth . '', 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfo2usvjfqc i would argue that his speech within this video has more relevance today than it ever did . 
  we can not allow the religion of islam to degrade us and our humanity . 
  how would that even work ? 
  are we going to send out tens of thousands of buses , they 're all going to get on , and go and live elsewhere ? 
  even though some have been here for multiple generations ? 
  uncertainty is not good , but people seem to be focused on how bad the british economy is doing because of brexit , and the british are being laughed at ... 
  meanwhile people are attacking european countries on a much more regular basis and one of the core points of terrorism is to degrade western values , and with that , economic stability . 
  if these terror attacks are going to continue with the frequency they have ... do people not think that will affect eur ? 
  what use is it pointing at the british and saying `` ha !, 
  you ruined your economy ! '', 
  when it would seem europe is ... well , `` under attack '' ( state of emergency in france , etc ) as many people are saying elsewhere . 
  just wondering ... ** edit : ** please do not misconstrue my comment as `` ha you were attacked '' as someone mentioned . 
  that is negativity i do not wish to entertain . 
  what has happened recently in europe has been terrible and as my comment history will show -- i have given my condolences in previous attacks , and [ oppose islam for degrading our humanity ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4u3ltr/shots_fired_in_munich_shopping_centre/d5mv2cs ) . 
  shouting `` i 'm not a muslim '' seems like a strange thing to say when you are firing a gun about . 
  do you have a source ? 
  some of the comments in this thread are pretty disgusting tbh . 
  anyway , my thoughts go out to the french people . 
  difficult times but you 'll always remain one of the most awesome countries in the world . 
  hopefully over time tension will ease and attacks will cease . 
   also , historically , the front national used to openly criticize the jews . 
  nowadays , both parites ( ukip and front national ) do n't dislike the jews openly , even if they probably do in private . 
  eh , not that i 'm doubting the ability of some of the people within ukip to be racist and such , but given that ukip has multiple ( i have no idea how many , someone else care to provide a stat ? ), 
  jewish members i 'm having troubling understanding that statement . 
  i mean fuck , the bnp 's stance is that ukip is a jewish conspiracy as it is ? 
  not sure of this kids particular legal status within the immigration system ( not that it would matter ... ) , but the fact is immigrants and very young ( 6 y/o is the youngest case ) children have been involved in us school shootings . 
  the fact he may not have been able to * buy * a gun may have not made much difference . 
  that said his comment is completely irrelevant tbh . 
  as sad and terrible as it is , the youngest school shooter in the us was a 6 year old . 
  there have also been incidents of school shootings performed by people that were immigrants and young , although i 'm unsure of all the cases . 
  it 's rather bizzare making presumptions about every citizen in an entire nation . 
  the vote was 48/52 -- surely that is evidence that we are a very diverse and divided society and so to presume anything at all would be ill-judged . 
   and yet , the majority voted to throw the polish out of the country . 
  no ... no they did not . 
  if you think that , then you are ** incredibly ** misled about what this referendum was about . 
  i think a lot of people outside of the uk do n't realize this was about sending a message , not actually implementing a policy . 
  the referendum , in the eyes of most leave voters ... for the most part was about saying `` fuck you '' to cameron , and a misled `` fuck you '' to the eu parliament due to media disinformation . 
  i bet most people ** feared ** change and voting out was exactly that -- except the idea of staying was misled by the media . 
  people here fear the eu . 
  we have our racists and our morons yes , but we try and keep them under control just like every other nation for the most part . 
  you 're literally advocating violence against all british people based upon a small section of people that we have no respect for . 
  it 's ridiculous and if you carry on with that attitude , ** you ** will be responsible for violent acts committed . 
  ** think . 
   gchq bases in mainland america i did n't say gchq had bases in mainland us ( not that it would even matter , although it would n't surprise me in the slightest ) . 
  i said they had powers in the us . 
  the tempora program is proof enough of gchq having power in both the eu and us , even * before * the inception of things like stoneghost gchq still had * power * . 
  gchq and other eu intel agencies have powers in the us too . 
  let 's not be fooled into thinking it is one way . 
  well played * department of tourism for romania * . 
  well played . 
  uh , we 've lost entire nuclear weapons ... 
  either way i 'm not sure how that relates to how we operate our armed subs , as it is completely different -- and yet even so we still have issues . 
  police in my country do not carry guns generally , and with regards to the ones that do , there 's no way any type of screening would prevent underlying thoughts from progressing over years/months/weeks that could lead to a similar situation given the correct circumstances . 
  how , exactly ? 
  police are screened all the time in `` first world '' countries . 
  police also kill people all of the time , even before they 've had to deal with any * real * stress ( loss of a loved one , like this example ) . 
  hell , some police kill for * fun * , let alone something like this . 
  they 're human . 
  he could have had this boiling up for years , months , or even mere weeks . 
  i fail to see how screening could have stopped this , especially considering how useless mental health screening is anyway . 
  i 'm asking for a source for your claims . 
  afaik the figure you are using only refers to the [ vulnerable persons relocation scheme ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/vulnerable-persons-relocation-scheme-for-syrian-nationals ) , which does n't include * all * syrian refugees * at all * , and does n't have a religious requirement of being christian anyway ? 
  not to mention even if the figure you were quoting was correct , it 'd still likely be more than some eu nations , * even after * those statements 3 years ago .
