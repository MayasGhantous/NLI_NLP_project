  where britain goes , others follow . 
  pay close attention to the upcoming elections in europe this year .

  very exciting times for everyone !, 
  ( except maybe countries shackled to the eu corpe lol ) . 
  anyway , i wish the eu all the best . 
  i just ca n't imagine it lasting much longer , the eu is the past . 
  rip germany as an economic power in a few years, 
   but the us and the uk do n't really like free trade and prosperity . 
  they do . 
  they just do n't like it when the deals do n't benefit them , as an example if the uk had to give up control of its borders to a number of countries which are significantly poorer than itself . 
  except on economic matters ? 
  no mainly on economic matters . 
  trump has said he wants a trade deal with britain and britain wants one back . 
  australia and new zealand have already begun work on a trade deal with the uk . 
  it represents a broader geo-political shift away from the eu and towards the rest of the world . 
  times are changing and it 's very exciting !!!, 
  not delusions at all . 
  all the signs from prominent politicians in the respective countries are they all want to begin to work more closely with each other , particularly as the us and the uk re-align away from the european union . 
  it 's an idea that incredibly plausable given the historical and cultural bonds . 
  and tbh most people would favour this type of union over a failing pan-european one . 
  no one ever claimed destroying economic ties . 
  i mean the anglosphere could begin to trade more with itself , allow for the easier flow of migrants , work even closer on matters of intelligence and security , defend each others intrest on the world stage etc. 
  none of that means destroying existing trade arrangements . 
  the reason this idea always gets downvoted to oblivion in this sub is because everyone is begining to realise the world is moving on from the eu , it is a failing , crumbling organisation . 
   which countries are the most important trade partners for australia ? 
  the idea that regional trading blocks are the basis for geo-political alliances is an absolute nonsense . 
  that idea is only given any credibility in europe , and recently it 's taken an absolute smashing via brexit . 
  how many australian/new zealanders watch chinese films and tv shows ? 
  how many operate on chinese websites ? 
  how many study at chinese universities as opposed to say american or british ones ? 
  do they see more inward migration from china/japan or us/uk ? 
  yes , as the vast majority of those are in poverty and china has a hugely lower gdp . 
  i think the anglosphere will strengthen after all of this by becoming closer . 
  china would n't be able to compete with an increasingly close alliance of the uk , usa , canada , australia and new zealand . 
   oh shit , time to invest in dublin housing if you have a spare million knocking about, 
  so by * switzerland reject * the title means the swiss foriegn minister disagrees with an idea being floated around on the swiss political right . 
   may wants to cherry pick through a new fta so are you suggesting there will be no fta between the uk and the eu ? 
  literally never seen nor heard anyone cover this story in the uk, 
   i do n't think they have actually have time to deal with you lot , especially when your clout is not as big as it seems . 
  so are you suggesting the largest and most powerful country in the world only has time to deal with the second largest and most powerful country over an entire presidential term ? 
  our clout is very big , 5th largest economy in the world out of 200 odd . 
  to suggest it 's not beneficial for the us to have an open trade deal with us is laughable . 
  no i did n't . 
  my original comment was * `` clearly not enough to change public opinion in the slightest '' * . 
  i never said nothign has changed , i said not enough ha changed to change public opinion , which is true . 
   i meant like , totally nothing happened in the last 2 years that could 've possibly have triggered an opinion change among people . 
  yes , lots has happened , we all know that , but public opinion has not budged in the slightest . 
  what point are you trying to make ? 
   it did not prevent thousands of underaged girls from getting raped though poilce incompetency caused those girls to get raped , the poilce knew exactly what was going on . 
  they were just terrified of making arrests for fear of being called racist . 
  nothing to do with a lack of intelligence . 
  highly unlikely, 
  cricket we 're ranked 5th in the world , higher than any other european nation . 
  quidditch i have no idea about . 
  you do realise advanced non-eu countries significantly out perform eu ones ? 
  multiple options to choose from . 
  i personally favour having a northern ireland/great britain border rather than an ireland/northern ireland one . 
  but of course brussels could refuse this by not allowing northern ireland in a european free movement area , which could lead to irish people being killed . 
   oh yeah , it 'd be brussel 's fault for customs and passport checks ? 
  what do you suggest ? 
  yes , funnily enough if brussels forces a hard border between ireland and northern ireland it would entirely be brussel 's fault . 
  who 'd have thunk it ? 
  taken as a collective they 're extremely popular . 
  if you prefer we could play [ rugby ] ( http://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/18193834/unbeatable-england-prove-how-far-come-perfect-year ) ? 
  i would encourage you to watch/read about may 's speech today . 
  she adressed many key points which the entire internet is tlaking about , including stating the uk government 's official intent on keeping the border netween the republic and the north open . 
  the only way there would be broder checkpoints is if the eu forces it upon ireland , which could potentially push ireland towards leaving the eu in the future . 
  [ yep ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/donald-trump-interview-brexit-uk-trade-deal-theresa-may-phthbjsmw ) , trump on our side . 
  i would encourage you to read/watch the entire interview . 
  he effectively states his support for brexiteering britain and shits all over the eu , 
  clearly not enough to change public opinion in the slightest, 
  have you been in a cave all of today ? 
  may adressed it in her speech, 
  no , we 'll stick to the olympics , 
   that 's not what a trade war is ** trade war definition : ** a situation in which countries try to damage each other 's trade , ** typically by the imposition of tariffs ** or quota restrictions . 
  it 's the textbook definition of a trade war , and the uk is more than ready to play ball . 
  provided we do n't see terrorist attacks as often and to the scale they do on the continent , i am completely fine with this . 
   and why would you want a trade war ? 
  to hurt the eu as much as possible, 
  the eu has made it very clear they want to inhibit the uk economy from performing well by limiting trade to prove to other eu members leaving the union is not the answer . 
  that is a trade war and ultimately the eu will lose . 
  have fun dealing with putin with only the french military . 
   yes , a loud minority on a internet forum no the entire eu has shown there true colours , not just this sub . 
  although of course this sub is incredibly petty . 
  i want the eu to collapse and with the uk , usa and russia against it i 'm very sure it will . 
  the uk decided it wanted control of its borders , the ability to sign its own trade deals and not to be apart of the eu political project . 
  the eu and its residents then decided they want the uk to fail and to ultimately split up into multiple countries . 
  the eu is a crumbling and we all know it . 
  britain is more than ready for a trade war , bring it on . 
  i really do n't care . 
  europeans have shown their true colours and britain will respond . 
  we are more than ready for a trade war . 
  i want britain to slash its corporation tax rates , with that and trump 's american on our side , i am very confident we 'll come out on top , 
  6 is very important . 
  i hope the eu cooperates instead of playing politics with people 's lives, 
   does hard brexit mean that financial center is moving to continental europe ? 
  no , an eu negotiator stated the other day the eu will look to retain access to britain 's financial services . 
  it 's effectively the eu admitting they do n't have the financial infrastructure to take business from london .
