  it 's a british show , most of the british audience do n't even know what that song is . 
  sorry should re-phrase , they beat nazi-europe * after * standing alone . 
  they were the only nation in the world standing up to the nazi regime when everyone else assumed the war was over and done with . 
  only after they dealt decisive blows to the nazi war machine in the battle of britain did other countries , like the us , start believing it was possible the allies could win . 
   all citizens of a nation greater than our own the eu is not a nation, 
  yeah , i get the impression they 're quite well dispersed which helps intergration hugely . 
  same with the chinese in britian . 
  probably for job opportunities as she is an academic , the only place in europe to have a serious academic career is the uk . 
  it 's more they are proud of beating a nazi-europe when they stood alone after france fell within a few weeks, 
  i 'm talking about rugby, 
  england to win the next world cup , 
  where is the data for this ? 
  everything i 've read suggests france are not that in favour of federalisation . 
  if they were no longer influential , no one would realy care they voted to leave the eu . 
  why are eu federalists * obsessed * with the british empire ? 
  you must be used to it by now ? 
  the sub dislikes the english because the english are influential , right-wing and voted to leave the eu, 
  what are you harping on about ? 
  we 're talking about the british bill of rights replacing the european one . 
  which is a very good thing which i have proven and you 're just copy and pasting irrelevant comments . 
  in response to that comment , there is rules . 
  just the rules will be enshrined in a new british bill of rights as demanded by the british public . 
  that was an incredibly east point to rebute . 
  next . 
  wow , you 've sure convinced me a bill of rights drafted by british representatives elected by the british public which can be changed at anytime should the british people deem it necessary is a bad idea / s, 
  ** yawn ** no proper argument whatsoever so you attempt to defame the person you 're arguing by painting them as gullible . 
  if you do n't have a solid rebuttal to my point then you should probably stay quiet . 
  aka a bill of rights drafted by british representatives elected by the british public which can be changed at anytime should the british people deem it necessary . 
   also was your country led by germans quite a long time does not compute, 
   - i ` am german we know how to lead does not compute, 
   the current uk government wants to kill european human rights legislation that 's because it wants to replace it with a british bill of rights . 
  so i 'm assuming in your eyes canada , australia and new zealand are all not democracies ? 
   to be honest calling the british system a `` democracy '' is stretching the definition democracy definition : a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state , ** typically through elected representatives ** need i go on ? 
  i 'm pretty obsessive about british politics so i probably know more, 
   even the person probably most-world-renowned for being intelligent , yes , and my point was despite him being renowned for intelligence , it does n't mean he has any more knowledge on politics than an a-level politics student . 
  she probably deemed it an unnecessary headache , which has now become necessary . 
  the tory whip will come down hard on this though , i 'll be very suprised if it does n't pass . 
  of course i 'm aware that eton is the country 's top school , former students from there go on to do extremly well . 
  that does n't guarentee success though , the incompetant ones go nowhere , much like in all walks of life . 
   that means the parliament can not ratify it . 
  why does it mean that ? 
  why does it mean that ? 
  it just means it has to be ratified by parliament . 
  of course it 's too complex for him . 
  he has never worked in politics in his life . 
  it would be like a top level lawyer suddenly trying to perform brain surgery . 
  he may be clever but politics is not his field . 
  but there is an army of people who went to the same/similar school as him and sound assured , under your logic they should all be top level politicians ? 
  why have you linked that ? 
  yeah , that 's certainly a key factor . 
  however britain is a country that 's quite focused on class and there is a certain amount of elitism in professional circles . 
  people tend to like people who are from a similar walk of life to them , if the majority of people in job creating/employing positions speak rp , subconsciously they 're going to lean towards employing others who do as well . 
  accent may not be the be all and end all it once was , but i would say speaking with rp is still a professionally beneficial asset . 
  british speak a more advanced version of the language . 
   today , it 's no longer necessary . 
  i disagree , if you look at all the people in top jobs in the uk 99 % of them speak with rp . 
  it really does matter , although to what extent is debatable . 
  is that true for all accents ? 
  or only the more regional ones ? 
  i always got the impression the british middle/upper class accent was clear and easy to understand . 
  scotland is not it 's own independant country , it does n't mean they should n't have a say . 
  yeah man , the rest of the uk is jealous of london 's succes , the rest of europe for that matter . 
  the islands have been reffered to as the british isles since the roman times , it is a geographical term , not a political one . 
  a few angry millennials in ireland wo n't change that , sorry . 
  i do n't think the scots could afford it with the state of their public finances xd, 
  you ca n't honestly believe the eurozone is doing better than the uk ? 
  i want you guys to do well and everything but it is no secret the uk has outperformed the eurozone . 
  even in 2016 the uk is the top performing g8 economy and has grown 0.5 % since the brexit vote , significantly above the eurozone . 
  what will happen in the future remains to be seen , but since the 1990s the uk has done much better than the eurozone countries taken as a collective . 
  no , it grew 0.5 % in the three months after the vote , signifcantly more than predicted . 
  it is also the fastest growing economy of the g8 in 2016 . 
   well boris is pretty much done now he 's got the third/fourth most important job in british politics , after the prime minister and the chancellor . 
  in all truth it 's a decisive step up from the mayor of london . 
  anglosphere strong, 
  the brexit people decided they want their elected government to control their borders , that 's all it is . 
  those were my words , but that was the sentiment . 
  the imf predicted * a vote * to leave the eu would force the country into a recession , not actually leaving , but merely a vote , that has n't happened and that was my point . 
  [ you do n't consider the imf reputable ? 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/10/04/imf-rows-back-on-brexit-warnings-as-uk-poised-to-become-fastest/ ), 
  you ca n't honestly think russia is a real geo-political threat to the united states ? 
  their economy is about the same size as australia 's . 
   why would it drop off a cliff just by announcing an intention ? 
  most predictions stated all businesses would up and leave and that investment would stop instantly . 
  neither of these happened . 
  huh ? 
  german ? 
  well , it 's either that or let russia have their way with the east . 
   guys seriously what kind of bullsh ... is this , uk is still officially part of eu yes , but everyone from the bank of england to the imf stated the british economy would drop off a cliff as soon as it voted out , that 's why this is significant . 
   mainly movies and retail . 
  really ? 
  i read the service growth was mainly in storage , transport and communications . 
   when decisions are made in the center , you cry about mah sovereignty when did i say that ? 
  * lol at the butthurt downvotes *, 
  moments like this i 'm glad we 're on our way out of this dysfunctional political bloc . 
  shakespeare ahead of newton or darwin ? 
  yeah , same here in the uk tbh . 
  i only know of their existence from them being referenced in american tv . 
  for the uk there is too many to narrow it down to just one . 
  but the main contenders would be newton , darwin , shakespeare and churchill . 
   well yes of course , you 're still in the eu , still enjoying all its advantages .
