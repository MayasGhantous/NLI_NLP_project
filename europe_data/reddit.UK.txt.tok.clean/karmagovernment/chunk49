  it 's a map of countries adjusted for their relative gdp size posted to what is largely a geo political sub . 
  i find it remarkable some people have more trust in anonymous career bureaucrats in a different country than their own elected officials . 
  uk stronk as always, 
   it really takes few economy college classes to realise that gdp is n't an accurate portrayal of economic wellbeing no it does n't , everyone knows that . 
  it 's just a handy way of measuring a country 's overall economic strength in comparison to other countries . 
   we need this with a per capita map to get perspective . 
  why would that mean more perspective ? 
  this is a map that shows the overall economic weight of a country . 
   the transitional phase to what ? 
  new economic and trading relationships with the eu and the rest of the world . 
  right , so a fall in the # ( something which is often held up as very bad by europhiles ) has lead to cheaper exports * in the short term * . 
  going off your own language , you 're assuming the fall in the # is temporary , and that the currency will refind its strength . 
  which , going off your own perogative of a strong currency being good and a weak currency being bad , means the economy will do well in the long term . 
  you 've fucked yourself chuck . 
  if britain has little to offer australia , why did the australian government fly a team of top negotiators to the uk days after the brexit vote to start hashing out the broad outline for a future trade deal ? 
   maybe that 's just an australian thing in general though most tend to love us , at least that was my experience living in australia, 
   i feel like the games are just a huge headache and waste of money for the host country not for the uk , london 2012 was a massive success . 
   both rich nations used to dealing with large crowds . 
    the olympic committee must not want to deal with any more controversies it seems . 
  most smaller cities in smaller countries ca n't afford to host them . 
  i do n't think it will be an economic success in 2019 , that 's very much still the transitional phase in my eyes . 
  i 'm talking long term . 
  i know a hell of a lot of eu nationals , and i 'm yet to hear of one who 's decided to move back to the continent . 
  it 's weird i keep seeing it in articles on left wing , pro-eu websites . 
  ** spoiler alert ** britain makes a success of brexit , we 're too dynamic and innovative not to . 
  search your heart euro fanatics , you know it to be true . 
  yeah , i was more talking in terms of time difference for me ( based in london ) . 
  what a terrible headline, 
  great news for the uk !, 
  cmon europeans , be happy !, 
  we have one cultural superpower amongst us !, 
  ca n't understand why the conservative party do n't give hannan a more prominent position, 
  is n't this obvious ? 
  germany has a very weak military and britain has a very strong one . 
  not to mention britain 's intel is probably second only to the us . 
  of course cooperation with the uk is much more important than germany to the french . 
  the germans do n't really bring anything to the table in this regard . 
  paris is fine , la not so much, 
  ** film becomes a blockbuster for britain ** ** industry is credited with making second biggest contribution to economic growth ** after 30 years in the city , tony maude has decided to follow his dreams and go into show business -- as a caterer on film and tv shoots . 
  as a bond trader , `` it 's very hard to make the sort of money that you used to make '' , said mr maude , who at 53 is launching the new venture with his wife and son . 
  `` we chose this industry because i felt that it was booming . '' against a general background of sluggish growth , where traditionally strong industries such as finance have slowed , the uk film industry is shining . 
  according to the latest official figures , the industry has moved from third to second biggest contributor to growth and last quarter expanded 8.2 per cent , compared with just 0.4 per cent for business services and finance . 
  the weakness of other sectors flatters , but the tv and film industry has nonetheless grown apace for the past three years -- `` motion picture and publishing activities '' , as the office for national statistics calls them , have grown 72.4 per cent since 2014 , against the eu average of 8.5 per cent . 
  the growth is partly from uk audiences flocking to the cinema . 
  uk and ireland gross box office takings from january to june were # 679m -- up 12 per cent on the same period in 2016 , according to comscore , which provides data for the british film institute . 
  but it is also because more films and tv productions are being shot in britain . 
  building on the legacy of the harry potter franchise , the next star wars instalment and tim burton 's dumbo are currently filming in the uk , hot on the heels of beauty and the beast and danny boyle 's t2 trainspotting . 
  `` i think there is a lack of appreciation of the scale of the industry in this country , '' said alex hope , managing director of double negative , a visual effects studio in london that has worked on films including wonder woman and dunkirk . 
  generous tax breaks in place since 2007 have been a big help : producers can claim a cash rebate of up to a quarter of 80 per cent of their uk spending . 
  hm revenue & customs says that 2,070 films have made claims since then and it has paid out # 2.3 bn in credits against # 8.9 bn of spending . 
  the weaker pound since the brexit vote has also boosted investment . 
  overall spending on film production in the first quarter of 2017 hit a record # 652m , according to the british film institute . 
  of that , # 620m was inward investment by overseas filmmakers either independently or with uk partners . 
  at the same time , tv production is doing well . 
  in 2013-14 , 25 television programmes claimed tax relief , spending # 169.5 m in the uk . 
  three years later , this was up to 45 tv productions and spending had nearly trebled to # 480m . 
  netflix 's big budget period drama the crown was shot across the uk in locations including ely cathedral , while northern ireland hosted much of hbo 's game of thrones . 
  meanwhile , a throng of british businesses serving film crews has grown in scale and sophistication . 
  dave chorley and mark bunce originally met in the uk working for a us catering location company on the set of the 1991 film robin hood : prince of thieves . 
  with the uk film industry struggling to support any large films during the 1990s , save bond , `` there was a gap in the market for companies from outside the uk '' , said mr chorley . 
  `` that did n't last . '' when robin hood returned to the uk for the 2010 version starring russell crowe , chorley bunce location catering was ready with 30 staff and six kitchen trucks to feed the more than 1,000 crew -- using jet skis to bring meals to actors on boats off the welsh coast , and sending crates of water up cliffs in helicopters . 
  these services command big fees . 
  according to jamie cook , who runs london-based catering company fayre do 's , `` for a 12-week film the average cost of catering would be about # 500,000 '' . 
  the film and tv industry have done particularly well for london and south-east england but other parts of the country have benefited too . 
  yorkshire and humber , albeit from a modest base , was britain 's fastest growing region for tv and film production between 2009 and 2015 . 
  ben hepworth set up prime studios in leeds six years ago . 
  the forthcoming bbc series girlfriends has just been filmed there . 
  despite acquiring the adjacent building , mr hepworth said he still has to turn down work . 
  a six episode tv drama can take up to 5 1/2 months to film , he said . 
  `` god , if i had the space . 
  that 's what i 'm desperate for , '' said mr hepworth , who is negotiating with leeds city council to secure another studio . 
  former trucker ian kitchingman set up his own business serving screen productions with one camera truck in 2010 . 
  now he has 50 specialist vehicles and employs 10 people . 
  `` i cover an area from coventry up to the lake district across to newcastle and down lincolnshire , and the workload at the moment is fantastic . '' mr kitchingman recently worked for swallows and amazons . 
  there are knock-on effects for local tourism , too . 
  news that dad 's army was filming in bridlington brought fans rushing to spot stars catherine zeta-jones and bill nighy . 
  `` hotel bookings went up 70 per cent overnight , '' said sally joynson , chief executive of screen yorkshire , a development agency that established a content investment fund in 2012 with # 15m of eu funding . 
  `` we estimate that [ the initial # 15m ] has secured # 157m worth of investment for the region . '' since its first investment in drama series peaky blinders , screen yorkshire has financed about 40 productions in the region and is now directly involved in running yorkshire 's biggest studio , at a former raf base near leeds . 
  although the eu supplied funding , ms joynson said she is not worried about losing support : `` yorkshire 's in a very good place , we 've been planning for the future . '' the fund is now self-sustaining . 
   why would i go to watch a movie to learn about history when i can read it . 
  you 're not fooling anyone chuck , you do n't read, 
   are n't you a bit salty ? 
  yes very . 
  i hate when random nobodies comment on things they have no idea about . 
  i mean , you have n't even seen the film , yet you 're debating it in an online discussion board ? 
   i wonder will the brits show how germany basically spared them more or less good thing we spared you in the end or you would n't be here , 
   but i do n't think it wants any part of the anglosphere politically . 
  they 're still terrified us brits will try and fuck them over again xd they 'll come round eventually . 
   you guys do n't even know your literature is considered one amongst many in continental europe lol , english literature is the best of all time . 
  this is fairly common knowledge . 
  your butthurt perogative will not change that . 
   the anglos read very few non-anglo books , all books that receive widespread acclaim are instantly translated into english and sold across the english speaking world . 
   apparently only showing them twice , fleeing . 
  yep , guessing you have n't watch the film . 
  the opening scene shows french soldiers holding the line whilst the british retreat to the beach . 
  you 're getting downvoted but you 're absolutely right . 
  france 's performance in ww2 was shockingly bad , there 's a reason they 're still so embarrassed by it to this day . 
  one mention of it and they get salty . 
  they hate it even more that it was the anglosphere that had to save them xd, 
   people will wonder were the french army were when this was going on but there 's no sign of it in the movie .
