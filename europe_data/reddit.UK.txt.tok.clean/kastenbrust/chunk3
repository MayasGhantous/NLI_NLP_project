  that 's just household consumption , one tiny little part . 
  germany does n't have the biggest consumer market in europe because germans do n't consume much , look at the statistics for yourself , both the uk and french markets are bigger . 
  the uk is the biggest consumer market in europe , we have more commercial transit traffic than any other european country . 
  i drove from the uk ( where it 's free for everyone to drive ) to switzerland a few weeks ago . 
  i chose a route through germany and spent lots of money in german towns on food , german hotels on sleep , and german gas stations on diesel , guess i 'll go a different route next time because of a shitty little toll . 
  they let you off the farm for a day in edinburgh did they ? 
  london is ok but most people are n't english . 
   now virtually all polls show a consistent and strong majority in favor of staying in the eu . 
  that 's slightly misleading , virtually all polls show massive demand for eu reform , even pro-eu people want reform , basically no one wants the status quo . 
  you do realise britain sent many shipments of gold , arms , food and other resources to russia , at absolutely no cost and massive loss of life to british sailors ? 
  something russia even recently recognised and awarded british sailors medals for . 
  without british aid russia would have been raped by germany in weeks . 
  britain bankrupted itself helping russia , and then eventually after many years the us ` graciously ' loaned britain money and resources at very high cost . 
   britain 's access to the continental eu market is worth more than continental access to britain 's market is . 
  this is completely wrong , the mainland eu has a 100 % trade deficit with the uk , the eu sells double to the uk than the uk sells to the eu , this is massively in the mainland eu 's favour . 
  the uk is the biggest consumer market inside europe , and the fastest growing too , it would be a massive loss to the eu countries to suddenly stop free trade with the uk , it would probably bankrupt some countries overnight . 
  scotland has had plenty of special needs pandering , it 's now time for the voice of england and wales to be heard . 
  scottish people overwhelmingly voted to stay in the union , they knew what that would entail . 
  oh shit , i guess it 's another decade of conservatives then , i ca n't imagine anything that will repulse english voters more than harpie harman . 
  it does n't matter , when the snp invariably fails to deliver most of it 's promises they will simply blame the english , westminster and conservatives . 
  the only solution is to give scotland total fiscal autonomy , westminster should have done that immediately after the referendum , it would have been hilarious seeing scotland go bankrupt now the oil price has collapsed , the snp would have collapsed too . 
  one of the senior conservative policy makers was on bbc last night saying if the conservatives get a majority ( which they now have ) this will be one of their first decisions , so scottish people better prepare their anuses , their wishes are about to come true . 
  do n't worry , we wont brick up le tunnel sous la manche , the uk could even have a closer relationship with france without everyone else meddling , concorde again ? 
   i think they should be 100 % thrown out ah the good old europhile emotional reaction , you want to throw the biggest customer and consumer off the european continental shelf ? 
  anyway it does n't matter , your business leaders will tell your political leaders what to do , and it wont be listening to your advice . 
  the eu will be begging the uk to maintain free trade , especially in the next 5 years . 
  and why not ? 
  noone needs to be treated badly , there 's nothing wrong with people wanting to chose their own futures . 
  apparently belgium 's economy boomed and grew the fastest it had in years . 
  `` poland you should borrow more money and spend more , will help your economy !, 
  also suck russia 's dick for money , promise will taste better this time . '', 
  it 's interesting that what greeks consider `` far right '' would economically be considered `` extreme left + racist '' in anglo-saxon countries . 
  greece did n't sign any international agreements saying the reparations matters were settled ? 
  i find that hard to believe . 
  woosh . 
   the french revolution and the revolutions of 1848 were way more successful hold on , i would n't exactly define them as `` successful '' at all , unless you consider tanking the economy and creating another dark ages economically as success , plus killing stupid amounts of people . 
  this is what anglo-saxon means in ** social ** contexts , it does not explain what anglo-saxon means in economic , political , cultural , philosophical or historical contexts . 
  simply the social model does n't explain any of those things , other than from a left wing critical perspective . 
  over the several years and accounts i 've had on reddit , / r/europe has become / r/europeanunion or more precisely / r/europhiles , even the logo is the eu flag , it 's now basically an eu political organisation centric subreddit rather than a european cultural and geographic location subreddit . 
  this only makes sense if the `` other people '' use a different currency and are totally separated economically from you , and not in a shared currency , economic and political union where they completely dominate you . 
   just look at the kennedys no one can protect you from the cia . 
  all humans are one race , there is no gypsy race , you are the one being racist . 
  that 's the centre point of europe but not the centre point of the eu , norway is n't in the eu so it 's land mass and islands ca n't really count . 
  i 'd be interested in knowing what the actual centre point of the eu is though . 
  because those countries do n't need the money , and the majority of eu citizens do n't live in those countries but split amongst others , so by basing the hq somewhere else it shows goodwill and an attempt to actually care about the european periphery . 
  you also assume countries such as poland wont be dominant in the future . 
  the fact they are the regional powers is a good reason not to base the eu hq near them . 
  i vote for the dutch antilles in the caribbean , they are always hot , outside the hurricane belt so constant good weather , lots of tasty dutch beer , hot women and weed . 
  that makes no sense , what about all of eastern and southern europe ? 
  it should be somewhere like north west hungary ; central , plenty of land and really cheap running costs . 
  surely it makes more sense to have the permanent seat somewhere more central in europe ? 
  `` the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people 's money . '' -- margaret thatcher, 
  they are only single-issue if you look at them from the outside . 
  nationalism is one hell of a drug . 
  frenchie being nice , must be some kind of trick , prepare the fleet . 
  the british public are vastly eurosceptic , i think something like 80 % want eu reforms , those who want to stay in want the eu to change radically , there 's hardly anyone who wants to maintain the status quo . 
  being sceptical about something in this way and wanting constant improvement is a good thing in my opinion . 
  labour supporters = / = labour party . 
  greece does n't exactly have the economic , industrial , technological , scientific , political and legal modern history of the uk though . 
  after ww2 the uk was still an economic powerhouse and by far one of the world 's largest economies , with one of the worlds reserve currencies , greece has none of this . 
   unfortunately nobody wants to admit that they made bad loan decisions you mean france and germany do n't want half their banks to go bankrupt with all their exposure to greek debt , followed by every pension fund with greek debt ( most ) . 
  german pow 's mostly were n't kept in camps , they were sent to britain and lived with normal working / middle class british families where they helped doing normal work , had relationships , received a salary etc , which is why a huge amount decided to stay in britain after the war . 
  uk some of our sheep got irradiated because they ate grass watered by rain which had come into contact with the radiation cloud . 
  these sheep had to be killed , welsh people had no sex for 1 year , never forget . 
  hey at least there 's more water , and it does n't come all at once !, 
  the uk already takes a massive amount of migrants , this new suggestion by merkel will benefit both the uk and germany , we will take in less under this agreement . 
  it will be countries such as finland , poland , austria and other countries that currently do n't take a lot of migrants who will be in for a big surprise . 
  so then why did they behave perfectly well to people in western europe ( france / uk ) , africans , muslims , indians ? 
  al murray is also a well known labour supporter and socialist , which is why he 's trying to bring down farage and ukip . 
  i think a law banning denial is a bit extreme , it 's easier to laugh at idiots that deny these things than waste court time . 
  i understood the germans conducted themselves relatively well until they came into contact with the red army ? 
  and yet they are electing people who advocate more debt . 
  with a shrinking population germany 's credit card wont be 0 % forever . 
  it 's working out fine for america right now !, 
  old data  [ average incomes return to pre-recession levels ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11447587/average-incomes-return-to-pre-recession-levels.html ), 
  the uk has recovered it 's living standards from the recession and is now steaming past other countries . 
  `` quick , shower them with money or disaster !, 
  meanwhile ignore all these countries who implemented austerity who are the fastest growing in europe . '', 
  til sweden had a low standard of living before the fall of the ussr . 
  productivity is linked to private investment though , not government investment . 
  also there 's no point investing in your business if there 's unlimited cheap labour available .

   people from england does n't hate the eu ( and farage is n't taking over the place as i type this ) english people just understand the difference between europe as a geographical location and the eu as a political organisation . 
  the fact that / r/europe uses the eu political organisation flag is a good example of things that would annoy eurosceptics in the uk . 
  why bother increasing productivity when there 's a huge pool of cheap labour running into the hundreds of millions of people only 20 miles across the sea ? 
  poland please send more immigrants . 
  funny story , during ww2 my grandpa worked for the american army , his job was to receive shipments of vehicle parts from american factories , then put the correct parts on convoys of ships leaving the uk destined to supply aid to the ussr . 
  these convoys were extremely dangerous because they had to go through the arctic and u-boats sank many , due to how embarrassing receiving this aid was for russia they did n't even recognise it until a few years ago , although they have now given medals to all the british sailors involved . 
  on the way the parts would be assembled into vehicles such as jeeps and painted with soviet colours . 
  a few years after the war my grandpa heard a story from us and uk troops who met russian troops in berlin , apparently the russians were amazed america was buying russian vehicles and they became really patriotic , and refused to believe the jeeps were made in america . 
  if i was poland nuclear weapons would be my number one priority , preferably ones on undetectable submarines . 
  also why a scottish king uniting england and scotland is considered english `` colonization '' . 
  i see you 've never heard of tesco value , it works out about 1.6 litres for # 1 . 
  good luck getting british nuclear scientists to move back from the us where they are paid three to four times as much without media smearing and more purchasing power to help the uk if it gives up trident . 
  the actual postage is irrelevant because mail companies subsidise post cards to each other . 
  any first class stamp will be fine , i usually use a large stamp to be safe . 
  it 's got nothing to do with arrogance , often when i work in a european country and try to learn the language the local people will just answer me in english , i 've never once in several years had someone in germany or spain actually talk to me in german or spanish despite my german being fairly proficient now . 
  i think people want to practise their english more . 
   ** to the us armed forces **,
