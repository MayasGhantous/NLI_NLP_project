  bae is the largest single defence contractor in the world to the us armed forces including us based defence contractors . 
   the `` flameless heater '' shows off american tech skills invented and manufactured in the uk , not surprising really , considering the british company bae is the largest defence contractor to the us armed forces . 
  let me rephrase that :  tiny island , too many people , ** shit government planning ** , do the math . 
  nope , it also misses all the us colonies and many others . 
  that map misses off a lot of british colonies , unless it 's a snapshot of the later declining empire . 
  tiny island , too many people , do the math . 
  spain is n't as dry as you think , it has hot weather but a lot of mountains and a lot of underground water in aquifers , combined with a tiny population for such a large land mass this means it has plenty of readily available water . 
  the uk does n't have a water scarcity , we are one of the wettest countries on the planet , we have an overpopulation problem , particularly in urban areas . 
  i doubt poland and the czech republic have water scarcity either , it 's probably just infrastructure problems and issues moving the water around due to rapidly growing economies , populations and ex-communist infrastructure . 
  nordic council lol . 
  depends what law you practise , the uk and germany have a huge excess of lawyers though . 
  best education = / = tertiary education . 
  we have a massive shortage of skilled trades , plumbers , it workers etc in europe and a huge excess of lawyers , marketing types and media degrees . 
  i do n't know where this data is from but a few data points are obviously wrong . 
  collectivists !, 
  ** [ ubermensch intensifies ] **, 
  it 's more likely that british individualist philosophy from locke , hobbes and hulme has much more to do with our distain for conscription and any activity that puts the needs of the state above the needs of the individual . 
  in my opinion you can find that paris romanticism much better in places like rome and athens . 
  paris may have once had it but it 's a big corporate international city now . 
  the real debate that has been raging for over 2500 years is between plato ( left / collectivism / socialism ) and aristotle ( right / freedom / libertarianism ) . 
  everything from descartes , kant to locke hobbes and hulme all descends from these two . 
  the quality of life in the ring wing area would boom , everyone would want to move there , and the communist areas would have to build a wall around themselves , not to stop people getting in but to stop them getting out . 
  that 's why they get to warsaw and paris so quickly . 
  til left wing is the only possible utopian future . 
  the ussr was a giant party . 
  spanish constitutional law is irrelevant as long as spain is a signatory to the un . 
  if catalonia organises a un monitored plebiscite ( vote ) and the population votes to become independent then spain can either withdraw from the un and ignore the vote citing it 's own constitution or it will be forced to accept the vote because other un countries will recognise catalonia as an independent nation . 
  the trios contract expires at the end of this season . 
  russia , uk , belgium i guess ? 
  greeks would probably go to cyprus too . 
  assuming those people stick around for the government to milk them at the time of 30 billion per year . 
  they will do what the mega rich in france did . 
  france gave the uk the codes because thacher told the french president if he did n't within 24 hours she would order a nuclear strike on buenos aires and the commands had already been sent to submarine captains . 
  the french president at the time recently released his diary you can read . 
  you 'd be surprised , the guardian was hugely anti-falklands-war because they are naturally anything anti-thatcher , so most older guardian readers were and still are against britain defending the islands . 
  that 's simply not true , david cameron leader of the tories has been the main eu negotiator for the eu / us ttip agreement , why would he stake his entire political future on a massive eu deal if he was n't fully behind the eu ? 
  you have to understand the massive international coronations that control the eu also fund and control the tories , no way they would allow the tories to let the uk leave the eu . 
  the tories in the uk are pro-eu , they just want a reformed eu . 
  they signed most of the treaties signing the uk up to the current form of eu . 
  russia would use it as an excuse to invade to protect russian citizens , it would n't be worth it . 
  it 's not that simple , a lot of spanish people from the east in catalonia and the southern regions around alicante are extremely butthurt about the franco regime , the people in those regions are more socialist and were very anti-franco , the communists provided the only real opposition and so they often support communism . 
  before the franco regime there were also tiny examples of peaceful communist communes all over spain , although in my experience of spain i would say this is because spain is naturally anarchic rather than anything to do with marx or communism . 
  most people do n't realise that spain is mostly empty , it 's very different from any other european country i 've travelled around , i 've been to most southern , eastern and northern european countries , and even places like italy and greece are very different from spain despite the fact they often get grouped together . 
  it 's very easy to find totally isolated villages where everyone supports each other , the farmer brings round fruit every morning etc , and there 's no internet , water or gas supply , everything is either from a well or in bottles . 
  these villages exist just a few miles outside madrid , there 's nothing else like it in `` wealthy '' europe . 
  it 's kind of crazy when you visit these villages , you arrive on modern eu built motorways ( which are mostly empty ) and you have 4g wireless internet from vodafone but no mains water and gas , very surreal !, 
  saying you have an it degree and want to work in it is like saying you have an english degree and want to become a bestselling author . 
  ok , that 's great , but what can you ** actually ** do ? 
  can you write software , which programming languages ? 
  what software have you made ? 
  mobile apps ? 
  games ? 
  can you make databases ? 
  can you build computers ? 
  maintain servers ? 
  run linux operating systems ? 
  understand information systems ? 
  i 've run my own it business making apps for android phones , i know there 's a massive shortage of it workers in the uk , a shortage of 40,000 and growing . 
  if you have a decent it degree and are n't finding work that very same week then you are doing something wrong , very very very wrong . 
  i 've written it profiles for family and got them jobs ** the same day ** , and these are people with pretty basic skills , they can just about cobble together a pc and maybe make a crappy website or android app . 
  you do realise that you should n't even be writing cv 's right ? 
  hardly anyone does cv 's anymore , almost all jobs are found from recruitment website profiles . 
  you have a great looking regularly updated profile , it matches the keywords the recruiter is looking for , and boom job . 
  do n't expect the recruiters to have any idea what they 're looking for , they usually know very little about it , they will have been told to look for a `` java mobile android studio junior developer with bsc '' and they literally copy and paste those keywords into monster.com and see who 's profile matches best and who was online last as those people are most likely still looking for jobs . 
  if your profiles are set up right you should be getting 20 + calls and emails a day with viable jobs from recruiters unless you are looking to work in a highly specialised field . 
  nono no oil just lebensraum . 
  muh never before tried real communism . 
  we just need to try my flavour to create a perfect utopia this time . 
  finland is n't in nato , no doubt putin is doing this to test nato 's reaction like when russia sends jets to incur into nato countries airspace . 
  if nato does n't react he will know parts of finland and the arctic are up for grabs . 
  occupation by russia was worse than the german atrocities during ww2 , hence so many countries allied with germany against russia . 
  concentration camps are nothing when you can just starve an entire country to death . 
  crimea is formed of 85 % ethnic russians , i believe strongly in ukrainian territorial sovereignty , but even if both sides agreed i do n't think crimea would freely vote to rejoin ukraine , the people are simply russian , even if that means they are worse off . 
  the same thing would happen if you elected krugman to be finance minister for a country , these academics are ideologues , they ca n't actually credibly run a business or country . 
  shit loads of russians mourned stalin , they kept his body embalmed in a glass coffin for everyone to see for many decades and tens of millions of people came to visit him . 
  all the people hoping putin is dead or who think the worst thing that can happen is someone worse coming to power , you are wrong . 
  putin has a massive 85 % approval rating in russia ... to put that into perspective the `` opposition '' politician who was murdered , boris nemtsov , had a 1 % approval rating !, 
  what do you think will happen if russians wake up tomorrow and learn their beloved putin protecting them from outside western aggressors and saving ethnic russians in eastern ukraine has been overthrown by pro-west oligarchs upset about western sanctions hurting their businesses ? 
  russians will go ape shit crazy , you think things are bad now ? 
  pfffff . 
  the best we can hope for is that putin voluntarily stepped down , if there 's remotely any suggestion that he was forced out of power i suggest everyone get the fuck out of eastern europe . 
  temporarily in ukraine when the new government came to power after euromaidan . 
  it does n't help that people make laws ( no matter how short lived ) saying speaking russian will be banned and there will only be one official language , and independent russian regions will be brought under central government control . 
  do n't lie , every dutch person i know comes to the uk when they want to see nature , or hills . 
  literally i met 4 dutch people on a caravan holiday last summer who were touring the uk looking for hills . 
  wtf ? 
  you do n't trust [ podemos with your pesetas ? 
  the rich walk away , it 's the middle and lower class who foot the bill . 
  lots of very dangerous people in history have said this , it always ends badly . 
  nope , there 's faster craft now in the us navy . 
  it ca n't use it 's weapons at 60 knots either or go across entire oceans whereas the us variants can . 
  it 's not the fastest any more , it 's range is also severely restricted , comparable us and uk military vessels can go over 4 times the distance . 
  it 's basically good for patrolling the norwegian fjords for russian trolls . 
  a different kind of escort from berlusconi . 
  russia is the total opposite of ultra-capitalist , it 's literally the textbook definition of crony capitalism ( crapitalism ) , there 's very little free market at all . 
  the leftists do n't have a guilt-complex boner for russia because of it 's soviet past , they have a boner for anything anti-american and anti-free market . 
  the way the eu currently works is to look who is the highest paid , then add 50 % , then add the biggest public sector pension on the planet then pay everyone that . 
  ukraine : please give more money us , germany and uk . 
   german military in general is a mess and budget cuts have made it all but useless oh hey there david lloyd george , what year is it ? 
  seriously , never underestimate the germans .
