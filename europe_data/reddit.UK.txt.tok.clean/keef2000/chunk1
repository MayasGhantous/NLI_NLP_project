  this is the opposite of what the uk is doing , which seems strange !, 
  why different ages for men and women ? 
  ** for the uk the current state pension age is : ** * 65 for men born before 6 december 1953 * between 60 and 65 for women born after 5 april 1950 and before 6 december 1953 ** increase in state pension age to 66 ** women 's state pension age will increase gradually to 65 between april 2016 and november 2018 . 
  from december 2018 the state pension age for both men and women will start to increase to reach 66 by october 2020 .

   it 's not for us but for the market to decide . 
  and since cheaper alternatives should win , i ca n't see how raising tax can be connected here . 
  you would need to raise taxes to cover the cost of benefits for the unemployed or alternatively let them starve whilst homeless on the streets . 
  or you would need to change the wages / income tax system to pay for the unconditional basic income . 
  are you prepared to have your taxes raised so that they raise enough money for everyone in `` menial '' jobs to be made redundant ? 
  i suppose if your job is rewarding why do you need to be paid for it ? 
  why not just have a [ unconditional basic income ] ( http://www.socialjustice.ie/content/policy-issues/over-25-countries-call-safety-net-life-during-international-basic-income-week ) for all ?

  if all the migrants landing on greece and travelling through macedonia , serbia and into hungary want to live in germany , what can the rest of the eu do ? 
  if they try to distribute them around the eu , what will happen ? 
  will they start protesting and rioting like they already have in hungary and greece ? 
  once they are in the schengen area and put in a country that they do n't want to live in , wo n't they just travel to germany anyway ? 
  and should take the refugees they have created . 
  i 'm pretty sure the first nations people will disagree with you about how successful mass immigration has been . 
  canada should be investing in helping the first nations people get into good jobs etc not letting more people into a country that they have no connection with whatsoever .
