  ** european commission - press release ** [ ** eu launches new european medical corps to respond faster to emergencies ** ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-16-263_en.htm ) brussels , 15 february 2016 ** the european union today launches the european medical corps to help mobilise medical and public health teams and equipment for emergencies inside and outside the eu ** through the european medical corps , eu member states and other european countries participating in the system can make medical teams and assets available for rapid deployment before an emergency strikes -- thus ensuring a faster and more predictable response . 
  the medical corps could include emergency medical teams , public health and medical coordination experts , mobile biosafety laboratories , medical evacuation planes and logistical support teams . 
  `` the aim of the european medical corps is to create a much faster and more efficient eu response to health crises when they occur . 
  we need to learn the lessons from the ebola response ; a key difficulty was mobilising medical teams . 
  i thank all the member states that have already contributed so far , and encourage others to join so the eu 's response will be able to meet increasing needs and will allow for better planning and preparation before any disaster . '', 
  said commissioner christos stylianides who is hosting today 's high-level inauguration event in brussels . 
  the framework for the european medical corps is part of the eu civil protection mechanism 's new european emergency response capacity ( otherwise known as the ` voluntary pool ' ) . 
  so far belgium , czech republic , finland , france , luxembourg , germany , spain , sweden and the netherlands have already committed teams and equipment to the voluntary pool . 
  ** background ** a key difficulty during the ebola virus outbreak response was the quick deployment of medical staff , as well as the logistical and management challenges which increased as a result . 
  this led germany and france in late 2014 to propose the `` white helmets '' initiative , which laid the foundations . 
  the european medical corps is now part of the european emergency response capacity . 
  the eu civil protection mechanism facilitates cooperation in disaster response among 33 european states ( 28 eu member states , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , iceland , montenegro , norway and serbia ) . 
  turkey is also in the process of joining the mechanism . 
  these participating states pool the resources that can be made available to disaster-stricken countries all over the world . 
  when activated , the mechanism coordinates the provision of assistance inside and outside the european union . 
  the european commission manages the mechanism through the emergency response coordination centre . 
  in an effort to step up the eu 's preparedness and response to disasters , the european emergency response capacity ( ` voluntary pool ' ) was created in 2014 , bringing together a range of pre-committed relief teams and equipment , for deployment in emergency response operations all over the world . 
  the european medical corps will also be europe 's contribution to the global health emergency workforce being set up under the helm of the world health organisation .
