  yes and the money they received was spent on food and clothing etc in the country where it was earned in taxes . 
  the point of benefits like child benefit is it 's supposed to be a cyclical investment in the country 's economy , i.e. 
  it is spent in the country where it is paid and therefore contributes to the country 's economy . 
  the fact that the money is being sent abroad means it is a drain on the country 's economy . 
   then maybe they should send taxes to polish treasury . 
  nope , you pay taxes in the country you work in , that 's how it works everywhere else why should poland be different , plus if you refer to the chart again we already do . 
   roads do not raise people no they do n't , but the people who build roads , construct schools , repair sports fields do and the money to do this and their wages will partly come from the contribution that the uk makes to the eu , refer to the chart again . 
  the chart was to show that the uk already gives money to the eu to benefit other eu countries therefore it should not have to pay twice by sending child benefit abroad . 
   uk did n't spend a penny to raise those polish parents a. 
  should we have to pay poland to raise it 's children ? 
  refer to the chart because maybe britain did , at least for the last 11 years . 
  i would hope those kids stay in poland so that can turn the polish economy into a net contributor to the eu finances rather than a net receiver . 
   only that one benefit again - a cyclical investment in the country 's economy . 
   unless for trolling purposes if you ca n't take it , do n't dish it out . 
   you are unfamiliar with common sense there are plenty of people in the uk who have no kids but pay into a system they get no child benefit from , that doe n't mean it 's ok for child benefit to be sent abroad , because again , it 's a cyclical investment in the country 's economy . 
  the point of benefits like child benefit is it 's supposed to be a cyclical investment in the country 's economy , i.e.
