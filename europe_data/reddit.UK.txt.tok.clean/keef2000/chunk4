  she says that europe has not learned to be multicultural yet , but i would say that it is the migrants who have come to europe have not learned to be multicultural . 
  you can see this in the uk where there are pakistani communities in the north of england and bangladeshi communities in certain parts of london . 
  these migrant groups almost always prefer to live in communities with their `` own kind '' . 
  they also prefer their own food , clothing etc. 
  with the amount of migrants who have come to europe and with their children who were born in europe that i would say yes , europe wo n't survive without multiculturalism , the problem is that we have multi-monoculturalism . 
  no politician seems brave enough to admit this and all we are going to end up with is divided towns and cities mostly along ethnic/cultural/religious lines . 
  maybe they did n't stay all that long because they felt like outsiders with all the rest of the workers speaking in polish and unable to speak english .

  he was suspected of being a terrorist , that makes him a `` terrorist suspect '' .

  in the uk when you are arrested you are told you are being `` arrested on the suspicion of '' whatever crime they are arresting you for .

   it 's the same as creating a new currency from scratch which you had to do for the euro , you simply do it again . 
  all countries who use the euro already have central banks etc , where as you had to create one for the euro in 1998 . 
   that would not just require to scrap the euro , but to create smaller currencies first to take over . 
  all the countries who use the euro had currencies before joining the euro . 
  there should be some rules somewhere of how to do this . 
   it 's not like we have stacks of the old money lying around that we just have to hand out . 
  what happened when you joined the euro , did the new banknotes just appear from nowhere ? 
  [ banknotes are replaced all the time due to damage etc ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/banknotes/circulation/html/index.en.html ) , you simply print new banknotes in the `` new '' currencies instead of euros . 
   then most national currencies are too big too . 
  all the more reason to scrap the euro .

  does the un think that southern and eastern european countries will still be `` poorer '' than the northern and western european countries in 2100 ? 
  how come it seems that the southern and eastern european countries have declining populations but the northern and western european countries have increasing populations ? 
  did they have to make cuts to public spending to do this or did they just not spend as much as they could have , continued public spending at the required level and saved the surplus ? 
  only the first option is what most people would recognise as austerity . 
  the second option would be good fiscal management . 
  stopping the free movement of people from the eu would half immigration . 
  you can not have any control of immigration from the eu whilst you are part of it .

  the main point is that it is a british article written for british people to read using terminology that they use . 
  if it was a german article written for german people to read it would use terminology that they use . 
  you are commenting on an article written in english from a british based newsite whose content is aimed at british people on a forum where the default language is english , i 'm sorry but you are going to have to accept the terminology that is used .

  if the headline was `` brexit : british immigrants sue eu 's juncker over talks - bbc news '' then people would be confused over whether they were immigrants in britain or british immigrants in europe .

  random-guy410 used the term immigrant in his comment , i was correcting his comment not the article . 
  as i said in the previous comment , `` the source is british so therefore they are refering to british people who have migrated to another country in europe '' . 
   [ an expatriate \\ ( often shortened to expat \\ ) is a person temporarily or permanently residing , as an immigrant , in a country other than that of their citizenship .
