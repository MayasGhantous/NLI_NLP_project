  in answer to 1 . 
  zwarte piet may be a unique character but it is still white people doing blackface . 
  othello is a unique character but you wo n't get white actors doing blackface to play him nowadays . 
  in answer to 2 . 
  there may be not intent to mock but that does n't mean people wo n't see it as mocking . 
  do n't underestimate people 's ability to be offended . 
  if there were no black people in the netherlands then there would be no black people there to be offended plus there would n't be people to be offended on their behalf , but like i said `` the world has changed '' . 
  because it is a caricature . 
  it is mocking of features of black people . 
  when it was started it was probably wholly innocent and not meant to cause offence , but the world has changed . 
  the costume is a caricature , it is meant to be a bit of fun so it 's not going to be historically accurate . 
  plus to pasty white northern europeans they probably did look `` black '' . 
  slavery is not relevant to this case . 
   [ zwarte piet is the companion of saint nicholas in the folklore of the low countries . 
  the character first appeared in his current form in an 1850 book by jan schenkman and is commonly depicted as a blackamoor . 
  traditionally zwarte piet is said to be black because he is a moor from spain . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwarte_piet ) the issue is that `` those portraying zwarte piet typically put on blackface make-up and colourful renaissance attire , in addition to curly wigs , red lipstick and earrings '' . 
  therefore is putting on `` blackface '' racist ? 
  i would say yes . 
  should they change it ? 
  i would also say yes . 
   [ evidence of slavery predates written records , and has existed in many cultures . 
  graves dating to 8000 bc in egypt may show the enslavement of a san-like tribe . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery#early_history ) -  in the earliest known records , slavery is treated as an established institution . 
  the code of hammurabi ( ca . 
  1760 bc ) , for example , prescribed death for anyone who helped a slave escape or who sheltered a fugitive . 
  i 'm guessing that it does not predate slavery . 
  but it does n't really answer whether it is racist or not .

  a 1 to 1 payment would decimate their country . 
  go ahead , you could ask them for the money you let them off from paying back to the marshall plan . 
   or we can be mature about this entire thing britain wants a mature discussion about immigration but freedom of movement of people within the eu does n't allow for that . 
  we want the same control over immigration to the uk that you have over immigration to the us , i do n't think that is too much to ask .
