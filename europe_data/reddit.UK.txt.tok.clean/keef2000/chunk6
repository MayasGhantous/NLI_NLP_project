  when he was stopped by the police he panicked and forgot he had n't `` cut '' the drugs yet so he confessed , then later on when he was sitting in the police station and had time to think he remembered has was picking up the dextrose so he changed his story .

  if you are hiring people in germany to build a product surely they would charge you the cost of manufacture ( parts + labour + overheads ) + some profit for each item they make . 
  this would deal with  how do i deduct the costs that i have in germany ? 
  and  and why should germany agree to not get a single cent of taxes from a business that uses german infrastructure ? 
  in the us you would have to charge the customer the total from germany + the cost of us overheads + some profit per item . 
  the profit made in germany would be taxed in germany and the profit made in the us would be taxed in the us .

   and now you get big labour force from other parts of europe the big global corporations get this , people in the uk get to compete with the whole of europe when applying for a job .
