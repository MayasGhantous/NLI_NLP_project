  and yes , i 've taken punches , and harassment off people , even petty theft , and i 've never called the police because i ca n't see what possible good could come of it . 
  i 've also seen people seriously injured and serious crimes occur , and in those cases i 've called the police because for things like that you ca n't just brush yourself down and get on with life the next morning , but it 's only in those situations that it seems right to me to involve authority in the ordinary dealings of people in society . 
  i know you do n't , but i do n't see the point in involving the state in people 's personal lives for anything less than actual harm . 
  i 've been punched in the face before , been harassed by drunk idiots too , but i did n't go to the police because i 'm not a prat who thinks the law is synonymous with morality . 
  the law in aberration of morality and its invocation is unworthy of any situation in which no real harm has occurred . 
  oh yeah , i 'm sure his feelings were really hurt , let 's go rounding people up and throwing them in prisons because of it . 
  actually i have many times , but i would n't both even filling in a police report about it unless there was some lasting damage , because that 's what the law * should * be , a last resort for when you have been seriously wronged . 
  not a spiteful way to get back at everyone who has ever broken a rule in their life , and not way to try and force people to conform to your sense of moral right either . 
  maybe this mentality is why we have lots of stupid incidents like this in the uk , unlike places in mainland europe where order is prized above all , but imo a relaxed attitude about `` shenanigans '' imo makes for a far nicer culture than what they 've got over there in switzerland or wherever where you get bureaucrats knocking on your door for vacuuming on a sunday . 
  who is the victim ? 
  the guy who got bagels put on his head and then later started shouting and acting aggressively in return . 
  no offence , but in scenes like these , it seems to me that nobody is innocent , everyone is being a prat , and to bother to take this crap to court when there 's been no material damage to any party just seems like a waste of time . 
  court case cost thousands of pounds , what you say sounds overly litigious, 
  so what ? 
  two drunk idiots threw some punches at each other , it 's still an incredibly minor assault not worthy of a custodial punishment , or even a severe non-custodial one . 
  furthermore , unless someone was hurt , what 's the point of wasting government money on this shit . 
  oh come off it , nobody was really hurt , maybe 20 hours community service , but what you 're suggesting sounds brutally authoritarian . 
  you ca n't go locking people up for every minor scuffle , that way lies the fast track to fascism . 
   i would say that ' \u00e4 ' is more like ` a ' in many words like can ; and than e in pet . 
  this is n't true , but it can be confusing when you have different points of reference . 
  the sound in pet is / \u025b / in both modern british rp ( bbc english ) and general american ( cnn reporter voice ) the sound in the first syllable of a german word like `` h\u00e4tte '' in standard hochdeutsch is also / \u025b / . 
  there is probably some slight difference between the german sound and the english sound if you look at a very narrow transcription , but they 're so close as to be allophones in both languages i.e if you pronounce the vowel in pet exactly as you would pronounce the vowel in h\u00e4tte then you 'll be producing the sound within a close enough margin so that a speaker of the other language will accept it unquestioningly as that sound , and honestly regionalism within each language will probably have more influence on how this sound is realised for any speaker of either language . 
  in american english the standard vowel in a world like `` pat '' ( or can for the matter ) is closer to the vowel in `` pet '' than in british english ( phonetically / \u00e6 / , which is made with a slightly more open mouth than / \u025b / and does n't exist in hochdeutsch ) although sometimes it is diphthongised meaning `` can '' will sound almost like `` key-ann '' [ \u026a\u0259 ] . 
  however , it 's important to note that while the standard american sound is closer to - \u00e4 aka / \u025b / than the british one , the standard hochdeutsch - \u00e4 sound is still vastly closer to the standard british and american english `` pet '' vowel . 
  this is why native speakers of english get confused when german speakers use this - \u00e4 sound for words like `` hat '' and `` cat '' when speaking english . 
  i 'll also add that the myth that using the - \u00e4 sound is a suitable way to approximate the vowel in the english word `` hat '' is propagated but plenty of bad non-native school teachers who teach english in germany . 
  in modern standard british rp however , the `` hat '' vowel is rendered as / a / ( another sound that does n't exist in hochdeutsch , but sometimes in plattdeutsch :p ) which is even more open than the standard american version , and even further away from the german sound associated with \u00e4 . 
   yeah but the ` ei ' in receive is stil pronounced like a ` i ' and not like the german ` ei ' which is why english speaker mix them up in writing and do n't distinguish them while speaking i 'm sorry but this also is n't true , both have the same phonetic value ( again , possibly with slight difference with a narrow transcription but again , ultimately allophones ) . 
  hochdeutsch `` ziel '' and english ( most dialects ) `` free '' have the same vowel , both sounds are / i : / . 
  i 'll also add that most dialects of german ( including hochdeutsch ) do n't distinguish between orthographic long - i as in `` wider '' and - ie as in `` wieder '' , it 's all / i : / . 
  i can assure that typically english speakers do n't have a problem with these vowels . 
  essentially english `` ee '' and german `` ie '' , as well as short english `` i '' as in `` hit '' and german short `` i '' as in `` bitte '' are remarkably similar phonetically , and thus there typically are n't any problems with their pronunciation for german/english speaking learners of either language . 
  in fact , distinguishing `` i '' and `` ei '' in german is a problem that many foreigners do have , for example , the speakers of most romance languages and some slavic languages , as these languages lack short `` i '' altogether ( it 's a distinctly germanic language trait ) . 
  english speakers thankfully do n't have the problem . 
  the only problem i know of for english speakers is that they often find it hard to remember if words have `` ie '' or `` ei '' due the phonetic insignificance of those letter pairings in the written form of the english language . 
  for example , they 'll struggle to remember that it 's `` ich \u00fcberweise '' but `` ich habe \u00fcberwiesen '' as their brains are not trained to pay much attention to the ordering of these two vowels when they appear adjacent to one another . 
  you 'll find plenty of native english speakers writing things like `` recieve '' * because pairing of letters is a bit of a free for all in english phonetically . 
  english speakers have a lot of hurdles to jump before they can speak passable german , for example the vowel / e : / as in `` dem '' does n't exist in english , and many end up using the diphthong / ei / as in `` pay '' instead , which sounds wrong ( outside of some bavarian dialects ) . 
  also neither \u00f6 nor \u00fc , in either their long or short forms , exist in english , these have to be practised a lot to get right . 
  there 's also the obvious hurdle of - ch , and quite a few problems with the letter - l when it occurs at the end of the word . 
  americans may even struggle with the letter - o , both long and short . 
  but what you 've mentioned here just is n't typically the case . 
  i do n't think it 's extinct in the us , just limited to higher forms of the language , in the uk it 's a bit more common but still limited mostly to higher register speech and writing . 
  i 'm sure they 're thrilled , germany is hardly know for its cuisine either to be honest :p unless you 're really into beer and sausage . 
  or `` to whom did you give it ? '', 
  my point is that `` who '' sounds straight up wrong when it follows a preposition . 
  a sentence * for bagels on heads ? 
  come on now , if there were ever a minor crime this is it . 
  edit : i see many redditors here have a justice boner and want to see every piece of human stupidity punished to the full extent of the law . 
  i just hope you never do anything wrong ... 
  respect *, 
  the sound i represented with `` thun '' is schwa , it 's a vowel that sits in the middle of your mouth similar to the sound germans make at the end of a word like `` sch\u00f6ne '' . 
  the closest actual `` proper '' vowel to it in english is the sound in `` cup '' , so it 's natural for english speakers to render it as a - u. 
  this sound is n't represented in english in any sense , rather it simply falls on certain unstressed syllables and smaller more common words for which full vowel enunciation is n't necessary for fluid speech . 
  ( it 's of note that the vowel in cup does n't exist in german either , and german english speakers who are n't at an advanced level tend to substitute it for the vowel in `` foot '' , which is similar to the initial german vowel in a word like `` mutter '' . 
  this is actually a feature of northern english dialects like sean bean 's , so they can get away with it and still be understood for the most part . ), 
  many germans do n't realise that - \u00e4 in german has the sound of - e english . 
  if you say p\u00e4t you 're essentially saying `` pet '' in english . 
  the sound in the english word - pat does n't exist in german , and because of this native german speakers often perceive german - \u00e4 as being an allophone ( a sound that falls within the spectrum of noises that that will be perceived as having that particular phonetic value ) . 
  this is only true when they speak to other non-native speakers whose primary language also lacks the sound ( the danish have it i believe so they do n't have this problem ) . 
  however when germans speak to native speakers , the native speakers often have trouble because their attempt at a word like `` pat '' sounds exactly like `` pet '' by our phonetic standards . 
  the sound - e in german does n't exist in english , sitting between the english sound in `` pet '' and the english sound in `` pete '' . 
  native english speakers therefore perceive - e and - \u00e4 as allophones . 
  fortunately there are millions of native german speakers who , despite mostly believing they speak pure hochdeutsch , do n't distinguish between - e and - \u00e4 , regardless of whether the vowel is long or short . 
  so this is n't such a big problem for english natives speaking german if they too do n't distinguish the sounds , as most germans , even if they do distinguish the sounds , are accustomed to hearing the voices of people who do n't . 
  the problems english speakers have with - ie and - ei is nothing to do with pronunciation but an orthographic one . 
  the orthography certainly is n't alien to them , just look at works like `` receive '' for example . 
  `` i before e except after c is what we all were told in school '' ( which rather absurdly only works about 60 % of the time ) whether an english word has ie or ei does n't have much of phonetic value in itself though , we just have to learn which sound ie and ei represent through familiarity with the word . 
  what 's important though is that whether it 's ie or ei does n't make a difference to the sound . 
  thus it 's natural for english speakers to become a bit blind to the ordering of these letters . 
  it 's an orthographic feature that our language teaches us to disregard on the basis that it wo n't actually help up decipher the sound of the word itself . 
  for me it 's like thun and then , and the difference does n't sound small at all , but in many us dialects they are literally homophones . 
  remember you 're always better tuned into your native vowels , for example , germans often struggle to distinguish the sounds in pat and pet , but to a native english speaker they 're subjectively just as much different vowels as - o and - i. 
  similarly english speakers will struggle with the difference between - e and - \u00e4 in german , and sometimes even the difference between - e and - ie . 
  i 'm not denying any of that , and as i said , i was anti ttip and ceta , but when i asked many people what would a trade deal have to look like to be acceptable to them , many could n't say and tended towards spouting generic anti-american rhetoric , with the assumption that no trade deal with the us could ever be fair or mutually advantageous . 
  i should n't lump the anglosphere into one like that you 're quite right about that . 
  however , you say that these are simply reactions to events in the uk and usa , but do n't forget that those actions were just as much reactions to events on the continent , it 's a two way street . 
  merkel making such a point of inviting refugees into europe may have played ok with her demographic in germany , but it also fuelled euroscepticism massively elsewhere in europe , as well as fuelling american anxieties about an influx of islam into europe and the us . 
  looking back i think it could have been handled better . 
  while ideologically i 'm sympathetic with refugees and the ideology of it all , if it ends up splitting up the eu and pushing the us further to the right was it really worth it ? 
  it 's also too easy to be dismissive of the current political events , the americans just voted trump because they 're ignorant , the brits just voted brexit because they 're delusional and living in the past , but these narratives are actually harmful to western cooperation . 
  divide and conquer is the name of the game . 
  all i 'm really saying is that we need to wary of one sided simplistic narratives , and while it 's oh so fun to poke fun at trump and brexit and be dismissive , i think it 's unbecoming when germans fail to take seriously the reality that two of the world 's largest economies and military powers are in the throes of a wave of populism calling out for radical change . 
  an ideological war between europe and the uk/us is the last thing we want right now , but i ca n't help but fear that 's where we 're headed . 
  stealing other countries ' cuisines ( and words ) is a speciality of ours . 
  britain stands with germany on this one ( or least this briton does ) . 
  schnitzel not really thing in the uk which is strange as it fits out tastes quite well . 
  phonetically there is no difference between `` could of '' and `` could 've '' in normal speech so it makes sense that natives make that mistake though . 
  when your orthography is phonetic you do n't have this problem . 
  were it not then i think you 'd be just as bad frankly :p, 
  i like this and i agree with the sentiment but i do think the germans needs to be careful about populism themselves . 
  it 's all too easy to portray the us and uk as enemies right now , but this places right into the hands of far less ideologically aligned nations like russia . 
  feels to me as if a form of reactionary populism is growing in germany , one that politically opposes anglo-populism , and while it supports immigration and left wing fiscal policy , but still has a touch of social conservatism and `` us first '' about it . 
  no where was this more apparent than the anti-ceta ttip marches . 
  i do n't think ceta and ttip was good but there was a lot of ill thought out hostility towards them which often boiled down to `` we do n't trust the usa '' and `` capitalism bad '' . 
  it was very hard to have a real debate about it with people who were convinced of nonsense such as thinking the deals would allow the us to sell food that did n't meet eu regulatory standards in germany . 
  the sheer numbers that flocked out to protest were pretty indicative that this went deeper than just a trade deal with some dodgy articles in it for many , and was being experienced at a more simplistic emotional level of pro-us-ism and anti-them-ism . 
  fact is that the west is vastly more segregated and politically divided than it was 10 years ago . 
  if that were the goal of russian interference in western politics then they 've out done themselves . 
  it 's in times like these that it 's better that the west stand together , despite political problems and not focus on our differences , lest the very western liberal democratic hegemony be put in danger .
