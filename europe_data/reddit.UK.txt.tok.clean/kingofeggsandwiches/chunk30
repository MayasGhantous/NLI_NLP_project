  except it was obviously professionally translated and it was n't accidental at all . 
  insurance polices require that these things are seen by professional translators . 
  same distinction is made in english but i would n't expect most people to know that . 
  valve you turn to increase or decrease , cock tends to only have on/off settings . 
  a similar distinction is made in english , a valve would typically be something you turn with degrees of openness , whereas a cock would typically be an on/off affair with a lever you turn . 
  they are perfectly understandable , but given that the english is mostly there for the benefit of non-natives who do n't speak german but speak english as a second language , how many do you think will be familiar with the term `` alight '' ? 
  again , `` do not use in case of fire '' does make perfect sense , you 'll see it written in english speaking countries , it 's just a funny sentence in english because :  do not use a sharp knife in case you cut yourself can mean something completely different , whereas the german would unambiguously meaning `` in the event of cutting yourself , do not use a sharp a knife '' . 
  likewise the german clearly says `` in the event of fire , do not use '' but the english is less precise . 
  to put it another way , the logic of `` in case of '' only works one way in german , it unambiguously means if an instance of this , then do n't do that , whereas in english it can mean either `` do n't do that because there 's a chance this instance may arise '' or `` in an instance of this , then do n't do that '' . 
  this is just a product of translating english into german . 
  both languages have many many very specific words for various things , but both languages are used differently . 
  most translators do not want to hazard a guess on the context of what they 're translating and so translate according to a narrow set of rules that are `` approved '' . 
  this does n't mean that things are translated directly , as this is actually avoided deliberately on the grounds that direct translations are often confusing . 
  in fact , if there is a rule that states two similar words do n't mean the same they will never been translated that way ( even in cases where it would be better to translate it that way ) . 
  for example , you 'll almost never see the german `` unterwegs '' translated as underway , even in those few contexts in which they mean the same ( in most contexts `` on the way '' is preferable ) . 
  walking around germany reading the english translations you 'll find tonnes of gems . 
  almost all of them entirely grammatical and making perfect sense , however , they seem off to native english speakers because their meaning would simply never be expressed that way naturally by native speakers . 
  this is a perfect example of this . 
  the meaning of nothahn in a most precise sense is emergency cock . 
  a cock being a somewhat infrequently used word for an on/off valve that regulates the flow of something . 
  the only time i 've heard it used however is when talking about stopcocks for plumbing . 
  few other things are see in germany are : `` misuse punishable '' = missbrauch strafbar i 'm inclined to think this would be written `` misuse will be punished '' in english . 
  `` please alight at the next stop '' = bitte steigen sie an der n\u00e4chtsten haltestelle aus this is one is fine , but using alight as the most precise translation seems to neglect the fact that many speakers , even natives , wo n't be familiar with the word `` alight '' . 
  `` do not use in case of fire '' = im brandfall nicht benutzen this one make it sounds like it 's telling you not to use the lift because there 's a chance the lift could cause a fire . 
  ultimately good translation requires interpretation , but most translators spend their lives translating technical documents , instruction manuals , and various other things , and stop actually considering context that much and focus on providing an `` accurate '' translation , over a natural one . 
  the again is was one rule for the western front and another for the eastern , i believe the pows in the west , for example the raf pilots who crashed in germany and survived were treated quite well , whereas on the eastern front it was mutually assured torture and work camp conditions . 
  civic pride is really not big in birmingham i can tell you for certain . 
  it 's improved a bit in recent years , i 'll give you that , but it 's only really gone from `` birmingham is a dump '' to `` birmingham is on the up '' , the implication being that it 's not really there yet . 
  in fact in the past it was better , because there was solidarity , but now many working class areas of birmingham have no sense of community at all , and if they do it 's a community that excludes everyone unless they 're birmingham born and bred , working class , and mostly consists of white people . 
  it just seems like much of the british working class give up on community the moment a significant number of foreigners become part of the equation . 
  manchester is a bit better , they have more of a sense that their city is actually good . 
  that said , you 'll hardly find much communal spirit in much of it . 
  i can never see the residents of manchester relating to one another in the way the residents of hamburg do for example . 
  to me the uk feels overly culturally homogenised . 
  regional cultural differences are sidelined and always classed as `` low culture '' ( for example , northern culture is parodied and seen as unsophisticated ) . 
  everything is seen as under the the high british meta culture . 
  i do n't think it was always like this but has become so in the last 50 years . 
  well in my experience it 's not , and i 've lived all over the uk . 
  there 's a residual kind of pride , a sort of `` well i 'd still rather be here than anywhere else '' mentality . 
  rivalry with other local cities etc. 
  however , there 's virtually no civic pride , most people slag off their towns , and many think everything has `` gone to the dogs '' . 
  enough people believe this stuff and it becomes true . 
  it 's not just in what people say it 's also in what they do . 
  good luck finding many people in most of the country who revel in their local culture and celebrate it in a way many europeans do . 
  the fact that the lack of a `` regional accent '' is often synonymous with class and education in the uk speaks volumes . 
  also the only places in the uk that i think take a truly relaxed attitude towards foreigners in the uk are the cosmopolitan parts and immigrant heavy areas . 
  everywhere else this this ever present faction of anti-immigration types who are just convinced that immigration is spoiling * their * britain , even if they 're a minority . 
  the seeming absence of a social contract in britain was a big factor in my leaving for germany too . 
  just to live in a town in the midlands and could n't stand it there , so much hatred in that town bubbling under the surface . 
  angry old people suspicious of the young people , culture so often dominated by yobs , violence in the high street every week . 
  racists all over the place , from my colleague who while seeming nice would make comments about how indians returned things to the shop i was working at the time the goods would `` smell of curry '' , to the classic edl types , to pakistani youths who were militantly anti-white . 
  i think when multiculturalism became a reality a lot the british working class were like `` fuck it then , i do n't owe society anything '' and lost any semblance of civic pride . 
  people where i live now are actually proud of their city , like living here for the most , take a much more relaxed attitude towards foreigners , are n't constantly in a state of anger beleiving the world is ending due to hysterical tabloid nonsense . 
  it 's much nicer . 
  honestly , i think the government is just going to do anything to stay in the single market , and quite rightly . 
  my vibe is that they 're just prepping the brexiteers arseholes with lube until they 're ready to acknowledge that a single market exit at this point in time will be disastrous . 
  the thing is that it 's not even like all the people who voted remain did so to end freedom of movement . 
  a large swathe of them did so basically just to say fuck you to the government and the eu . 
  it is n't really a strong hatred of the eu per se , just a lashing out against the whole kit and caboodle , `` the elites '' etc. 
  these people do n't even need that much to change , they just need to feel like what they did meant something . 
  my theory is that one possible the government are considering at at the moment is a `` trial brexit '' . 
  may 's goes for eea like single market access with the long term option of leaving . 
  while behind the scenes she might try to secure an option that would allow britain to resume it 's previous position if it changed its mind within so many years . 
  `` trial brexit '' if you will . 
  this is necessary because if britain could n't rejoin the eu i 'm basing this on how many comments may has made on about trying to ensure brexit is a smooth transition and that there 's no need to hurry . 
  a deal like this could really buy options for everyone . 
  of course , this is just a theory , and even if the government were to follow this strategy it would n't mean the eu would accept it or that,

  i think you have something wrong with you frankly :p, 
  you get extra points for correctly distinguishing between shepherd 's and cottage pie . 
  i do it with parsley and sometimes onions . 
  celery does n't make you middle class imo , it makes you a middle aged woman lol, 
  how could you not ? 
  it 's mashed potato that goes crispy on top , mince lamb , gravy , peas and carrots , just add salt and pepper and perhaps a dash of worcester sauce for seasoning . 
  what 's not to like ?
