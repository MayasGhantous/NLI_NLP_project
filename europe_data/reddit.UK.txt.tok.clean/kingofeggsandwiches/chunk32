  after brexit the uk will have to negotiate new bespoke programmes with these nations . 
  it 's not referring to travel to eu countries . 
   there is way less tourism without freedom of movement of people because visas are inherently hard to obtain because of bureaucracy and complicated immigration policies . 
  except as i 've explained a bunch of times already , there wo n't be any need for britons to have visas to visit the eu after brexit , and there wo n't be any need for eu citizens to get visa to visit the uk after brexit . 
  as someone pointed out earlier even mexico has a visa waiver programme with the eu . 
  mexicans do not need visa to go on holiday to the eu , and neither will britons after brexit . 
  i only used romania as an example to try to get you to understand the absurdity of thinking that uk - eu travel will require visa after brexit . 
  i 'm not trying to disrespect you , it 's simply to make you think about the scale of the problem of implementing visa after brexit . 
   why ? 
  because you say so ? 
  no because the whole world says so , and that 's why you 've been downvoted so often in this thread . 
   can we both agree that `` freedom of movement '' is a generic and vague term that has limitations on each specific type of freedom of movement depending on each country ? 
  no we ca n't , because freedom of movement is an eu defined right under eu law . 
  as i said . 
  the us , uk , japan , australia etc. 
  all have visa waiver programmes , yet nobody would describe it as `` freedom of movement '' . 
   brexit is set to damage britain 's tourism industry yes , because of aviation regulation and increased air fare costs . 
  not because of visas . 
  look . 
  i 'm sorry if i was insulting , i 'm just getting frustrated going round and round in circles in this argument with you when the answer is so damn obvious to most of us in this thread . 
  go and read about international travel and the way more countries deal with it . 
  go read about the eu and principle of freedom of movement . 
  it 's the only way you 're going to understand the difference and see why it 's insane to think that uk - eu travel will require visa in the future . 
  i honestly just want to help you get this so you wo n't get a host of downvotes and arguments next time this topic comes up . 
  i am legitimately trying to explain this to you , but you keep asking for citations for things that just obvious to anyone who travelled in europe from a western european country prior to the eu becoming a thing . 
  i ca n't even understand your points my friend . 
  you are making no goddamn sense . 
  first off . 
   visa waivers equal freedom of movement for people . 
  no , this is false . 
  since i do n't understand your arguments at all i 'm just going to explain this once more in the hope you 'll see why everyone is downvoting you . 
  this started because you said brexit will affect tourists . 
  before the eu freedom of movement , western countries implemented a system of visa waivers , this meant that you could holiday for up to 3-6 months in a foreign country without applying for a visa . 
  freedom of goods and labour , and the right to reside , have nothing to do with tourists . 
  tourists do n't reside in your country , they visit it . 
  tourists do n't work in your country , nor are they a form of good . 
  tourists do not need to be in your country for longer than 3-6 months , holidays generally do n't last that long . 
  freedom of movement is a general term for the rights afford to eu citizens after the eu was implemented . 
  this meant no visas and no visa waivers . 
  i think what you need to understand is simple : ** visa waivers do not equate to freedom of movement ** the uk has visa waivers with the us , the us and the uk do not have freedom of movement . 
   romania , and other countries , needed visas because we did n't have any kind of freedom of movement . 
  nor for poeple , goods , not for anything . 
  this is not true . 
  prior to your joining the eu you needed visas because you were n't included in the visa waiver system that preceded it . 
  you were n't included because historically you were n't allied with the west and after the ussr fell it was a shit show and nobody knew what to do . 
  now , to address the quote you 've given me , it is true that freedom of movement has limitations as well . 
  there is a limit to how long you can go to another eu country and be defined as a tourist . 
  this is to stop people moving abroad and staying as `` a tourist '' indefinitely to avoid tax and claim on their nation of origin 's healthcare system . 
  if you overstay under freedom of movement , you just get in trouble and have to apply for residency . 
  if you overstay on a visa waiver , you get deported and banned from coming back for 5-10 years and will never be eligible for a visa waiver again in many cases . 
  they are different . 
  please , please , please try to understand that visa waivers and freedom of movement are totally different concepts . 
  freedom of movement is a right ensured you as an eu citizen , a visa waiver programme is an agreement between two countries to not require visas for holidays and business trips . 
  the problem is that this export boost is pretty much only due to the low pound . 
  if the uk goes hard brexit then it is going to need some pretty sweet trade deals if its manufacturing boom is to continue . 
  the best hard brexit scenario i see it one where britain retains free trade with europe , keeps free and easy migration between itself and europe to support its labour markets , but becomes its own economic area free to open itself to free trade even more than europe is . 
  that means a uk only ttip deal with the us , and similar such deals with the commonwealth and asia . 
  i think this is the brexit the tories really want . 
  immigration is just a side show to keep middle england voting tory . 
  long term economically it could be very good for britain . 
  europe see itself as a more protectionist economy . 
  if britain could have access to that while remaining outside of it , it would naturally have a big economic advantage . 
  however , i very much doubt the eu is going to roll over and give britain that , even if britain were willing to maintain the four freedoms , it would soon become apparent that britain was having its cake and eating it by freely trading with the eu . 
  the eu would have to act to protect itself from uk competition in many ways . 
  lots of people say you ca n't have free trade without being within being under eu regulations . 
  this is not strictly true , but it means long customs processes and all goods being subject to inspection and testing , which is costly and time consuming . 
  good can still be manufactured to eu standards outside of the eu , that 's exactly what us exporters do when selling to eu markets for example , but it 's a lot more complicated than the current system . 
  do you understand how much european money is invested in the uk ? 
  do you understand how much british money is invested in the eu ? 
  i 'll give you a clue , it 's more than the entire gdp of romania . 
  if every british businessman or woman who wanted to visit the eu , and every european businessman or woman who wanted to visit the uk , had to get a visa , then the economy be affected and the visa offices on each side would grind to a halt . 
  it would n't `` suck '' for tourists , it would `` suck '' for the whole of the eu and the uk , their businesses and their governments too . 
  it 's absurd to think that the uk , who did n't need visa to visit western europe before the eu , who still do n't require visas to visit countries like the us , canada , australia , and japan , will need visas to visit the eu after brexit . 
  the real point you seem to be missing is that those things are reciprocal , if the eu implemented visas on uk citizens it would n't just suck brits , it would suck for the millions of eu citizens that have business interests in the uk too . 
  it 's simply not feasible . 
  you still do n't get it . 
   before joining the eu , *** romanians *** were required passports and visas for travel in most eu countries regardless of their purpose for travel including tourism . 
  yes , because you 'd only left the soviet bloc a few years ago . 
  this is not true for everyone else !!!, 
  how many times do i have to say this . 
   you 're confusing freedom of movement of people with that of the workforce . 
  they are different things . 
  no i 'm not . 
  for fuck 's sake you do n't have the first fucking clue about how the rest of the west functioned prior to the eu , because you were n't included in it . 
  but i can assure you , we did n't need visas to go on holiday . 
  nato says 2 % of gdp on military spending , but you agreed to that when you signed up , so it 's not like you did n't have a choice . 
  it 's simply that many countries have neglected to do what they signed up for . 
  also , there are still people alive in britain that fought a militarily unified europe in ww2 , and tonnes who were children while german bombs were falling over our country and grew up in the aftermath with rationing and destroyed urban centres . 
  it 's a big factor in brexit that everyone seems to forget . 
  huge numbers of that generation voted brexit , maybe their traumatised childhoods are a factor . 
  do n't really follow there . 
  it 's hypocritical when a briton fears a militarily united europe but not when a dutchman does ? 
  i believe the dutch got invaded and were occupied , while britain lost hundreds of thousands of its sons and billions in war reparations fighting . 
  visa waivers only permit you to stay in a country for up to 90 days usually , they do not give you not right to work or stay longer than that . 
  most countries have visa waivers , the uk has them with almost all of its allies . 
  there definitely will be visa waivers , otherwise international business would suffer unnecessarily . 
  mate you 're getting downvoted mercilessly because you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   i ca n't do that in the us because they ask you for a visa which is hard to obtain . 
  you ca n't , because you 're romanian , because most of europe has been able to do for decades . 
  no offence .
