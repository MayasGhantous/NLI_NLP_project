it 's bothersome to have your cellphone constantly switching between your own national operator and a polish one . 
  i think there is an option for phones to choose the network automatically and as well for you to set it manually . 
  with the later i do n't think you 'll have those problems . 
  though i might be wrong . 
  there are some who want but i would imagine that 's because they are thinking everything is going to be easier as you wo n't have to deal with a different culture and language anymore . 
  and they probably think there are better career opportunities for them ( as for example you would not have to learn estonian to find a job ) . 
  in reality - russian speaking estonians and people who live in russia have different culture . 
  and as countries we are completely different , estonians are europeans . 
  there are as well quite a few people who complain about estonia often enough . 
  though estonia is n't the best country , russia is even worse . 
  so if you want to move to russia from estonia - you are just russian inside , that 's it . 
  in which language is it ue ? 
   therefore i expect the uk to exit the ue . 
  yeah , some could definitely read that as `` sound mixer '' . 
  keep calm and the day will come . 
   `` secret '' defense pact ( in case ussr attacked ) . 
  well too bad ussr does n't exist anymore . 
  the secret defence pact ca n't help with that now ( if that pact was specific towards ussr that is ) . 
  that 's one of the reasons i moved to england . 
  :d usually the walls in most of the countries are just boringly flat . 
  6 because we put numbers on the bins , so after the rubbish is collected we know which bins belong to our house . 
  north west , to be slightly more precise , close to the border of ( soon to be independent ? ), 
  scotland . 
  :d i 've quoted that from the it crowd as i 've just finished watching it , and the flag on that window was just asking for writing something related to sports . 
   though would love to move closer to london in the future , when i 'll finish the uni that is . 
  [ did you see that ludicrous display last night ? 
  maybe it just took them too long to make this list official ? 
  why is this document in german language ? 
  holy shit that 's awful . 
  the american 1,234,567.8 is more pleasant for my eyes but 1 ' 234 ' 567.8 looks fancier . 
  :p for 1.234.567,8 i feel like i need to use a condom . 
  wow the guy is just so silent inside !, 
  or damn levski for ruining the nazi symbol ? 
  haha , yeah it makes sense if he does that all the time . 
   and people at ted talks finish up with a simple `` thank you '' . 
  the truth has been spoken . 
   you mean `` god save the queen '' right ? 
  damn , i do n't know why but i had the word `` bless '' in my head and so i wrote that . 
  yeah , it 's `` god save the queen '' . 
   p.s. 
  i 'm quite astonished how you presented 3 videos with the perfect timing , i guess you have seen them before and just quickly found the moments in them . 
  with the lions i 'm especially surprised !, 
  i see them both in my home country and in the uk !, 
  coat of arms : [ estonia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/coat_of_arms_of_estonia.svg/800px-coat_of_arms_of_estonia.svg.png ) [ kingdom of england ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/royal_arms_of_england_%281198-1340%29.svg/410px-royal_arms_of_england_%281198-1340%29.svg.png ) ( 1198-1340 , 1360-1369 ) it 's like the game of finding the difference . 
  wow , that 's cool . 
  i like coins , thanks for the link . 
  the first one and maybe the second are awesome . 
  the last one is meh . 
  edit : wow , there 's even a prize if you vote for the winning coin !, 
  why americans and germans love eagles ? 
  haha , that 's kinda funny as uk puts the crown everywhere whereas the usa puts eagles . 
  :d i guess when brits say `` god bless the queen '' it 's `` god bless the eagles '' in america ? 
  ministry of defence sounds like it 's from harry potter . 
  i do n't even know if i need to ask what drugs did this guy take who designed it . 
  even a street artist could come up with something better . 
  that looks quite cool actually , expected to see something much worse !, 
  hah , this gave me some interest in the language . 
   krankenwagen [ release the kraken !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/fxttqg0rwu8?t=1m44s ), 
  i hope hearse in icelandic is `` death car '' !? 
  or 1/7 if you count the helicopter . 
  :d so clearly canada is the safest place on this planet !, 
  wow so many cars . 
  i like the order of the cars better in ops pic , in yours the ambulance car is the last one which is / r/mildlyinfuriating . 
  so now i can use my monthly plan anywhere within the eu free of charge ? 
  but what if my plan is unlimited ? 
  yeah when i was going to belarus i 've checked it was # 6/mb . 
  that basically means paying a tenner just to turn 3g on . 
  / r/bestof the child name is metallica, 
  unfortunately for some a regular saturday can be `` wake up , watch tv show , lunch , watch tv show , dinner , watch tv show , read reddit comments about the tv show , sleep '' . 
  by some i of course mean me and my last saturday . 
  opening the browser in incognito mode and using a public wifi ? 
  when was it first thought of ? 
  just curious how long or fast it took from start to finish a referendum . 
  i 've always thought poland was a better country than any of the baltic states . 
  quite surprised that the minimum wage is as low as there . 
   especially since easter europe is in the very last years of big eu funds . 
  after 2020 that funding will be significantly cut down , so there 's not much to threaten those countries with . 
  why is that ? 
  i thought funds were consistent ? 
  i might have missed the latest news , what sucks for greece ? 
  random post in a random thread about random people in a random nordic country . 
  life is random . 
   that 's a bus stop , not a nutshell . 
  imagination will fix that . 
   remember people , one ** tall ** man length !, 
  ftfy, 
  ca n't really see if two people fit there or only one ? 
  may the ~ ~ force ~ ~ freedom be with you . 
   stand back you vile beast or i swear to god i 'm voting true finns next time http://i.imgur.com/pgfnp5z.png, 
  oh , i meant they seem to feel much more excited after combining than after dividing . 
  seems people like combining but not dividing . 
  so what 's this `` molested '' thing about then ? 
  i liked this explanation : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/52pc39/a_polish_man_has_been_attacked_and_beaten_by_a/d7mbii6?context=1, 
  what 's wrong with polish people is that they 're polish . 
  hah that reminds me of myself , sort of , maybe a bit more twisted . 
  my parents immigrated from belarus and ukraine to estonia where i was then born . 
  i then immigrated to the uk to go to uni and stay . 
  i 'm nobody in belarus and ukraine ( lived my whole life in a different country and very different culture ) , i 'm sort of an alien in estonia because i do n't speak their language ( my parents speak russian and i lived in a small town where no one spoke the official language and went to a school where everything was in russian ) , even though i speak russian i have never been to russia and their culture is different , and of course i 'm an immigrant in england . 
  so there really is n't such thing as `` home '' for me , at least in a typical way , apart from england now but it does require a lot of work and cultural integration to be considered less of an immigrant and more like you belong here .
