bloody hell . 
  i agree with you on most of them , i guess i 'm just a bit more centrist/left than you wrt corporate taxes and deregulation . 
  i 'm kind of republican too , although i admit both sides have perfectly valid points . 
  seriously though , props to you for having such a spread , considerated spectrum of opinions . 
  liberal but right-wing then ? 
  i put watson first , creasey second , honestly both are great politicians who i hope have successful careers , and i did n't really mind who won . 
  with irish i just imagine ardal o'hanlon saying it , it 's hilarious . 
  no , but i am biased . 
  i read that internally in an irish accent , and it sounded way better than just the text . 
   we 're also the safest region of the uk !, 
  i honestly had no idea !, 
  given the troubles were in the not-too-distant past , that 's very impressive . 
  it 's truly a strange thing when northern ireland leads the rest of the uk on an issue , but serious props to your mps for doing so . 
  that 's an ... agressive foreign policy . 
  thanks for sharing , that 's really interesting . 
  what the hell , kola ? 
  why is your word totally different ? 
   how do you define who is scottish when scottish citizenship is n't a thing ? 
  that 's not very nice , given my country is third , 
  itt : romanians complimenting everyone . 
  [ how continental europe reacts to this news . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmolndabnhi ), 
  well , their frosty relationship runs both ways , they dislike each other . 
  the irish may dislike the british , but trust us , the feeling is n't really mutual , 
   commit mass sudoku unless you mean filling out number puzzles , it 's seppoku . 
  if this was actually a mistake it 's the funniest thing i 've read all day , so thanks , 
  exactly , let them all do whatever the fuck they want to do , providing all parties consent , but do n't grant special polymarital benefits . 
  i visit edinburgh fairly frequently , usually for the festival , and it 's absolutely lovely up there  aberdeen however ... 
  ouch . 
  that really hurts . 
  source : grew up in london , now at uni in the midlands . 
  west finland . 
  do you think this was partly due to the upswing of religion after the fall of a very anti-religious regime ? 
  that 's horrifying . 
  what a frankly evil government you have at the moment . 
  finnish is an exception , it seems complex enough that i respect it as a language , and am always amazed when i hear people speaking it  ( and seriously , when i finish uni , it 's a place i 'm considering moving to ), 
  apart from all these bloody foreigners speaking languages we ca n't understand !, 
  i think i recognise a word there ... 
  politicians do give bullish answers , but some interviewers are better than others . 
  one way to ensure you get good answers is to be very specific when targeting your questions . 
  also , note how i completely ignored your first question , and that my response seems complete without it :p, 
  asking multiple questions at once is just poor journalistic practice though - it allows the interviewee to avoid the questions they do n't want to answer more easily . 
  i do n't think they want an answer . 
  they 're probably trying to inform google . 
  to be fair , that would be accurate . 
  this is not the onion . 
  do we seem a bit like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/vmolndabnhi ) ? 
  as a brit , i apologise on behalf of all 70 million of us . 
  i thought that was weird . 
  the only other place i 've never heard of on the map is mountauban , but that may be better known in france ? 
  i had n't realised that , that 's got ta hurt . 
  i do n't see why the alive or dead status of an author should make a difference there . 
  surely their ideology can be taken on by others regardless of whether they 're dead ? 
  so you think that books should only be banned if their author is still alive ? 
  agree totally with the first part . 
  i do n't really think political books are fiction though , nor are sacred ones . 
  they may not be true , but they present themselves as if they are , and that 's the important part . 
  they can be , but i think that just hurts your point more . 
  there is a difference between quoting lotr , because it is fiction , and quoting , say , the qu ` ran , mein kampf , on liberty , das kapital , or any book that actually , stright-faced , proposes a political stance . 
  why do you see a distinction between books and speech ? 
  the only interpretation of this that makes any sense is the second one , because otherwise people can recite incredibly extreme material under the guise of quotation . 
  haiku !, 
  that 's irrelevant . 
  what you believe privately does not and can not matter under the law , what matters is what you say . 
  again , if you quote that verse , is that hate speech ? 
   a religion is n't just a holy book , a religion is all its believers and what they believe . 
  this is a really interesting point , but i 'm going to have to disagree with you here . 
  i think the confusion comes from different interpretations of the word religion . 
  you interpret it to mean what i would call a global religious community , i interpret it to mean an ideology and doctrine . 
  i think my interpretation both is more reflective of the way the word is commonly used , and also more reflective of the sentiment of the comment you 're responding to . 
  as i understand it , you guys are closer to a gaelic culture , right ? 
  as john oliver so elegantly put it , youtube comments are the most cogent written argument for never learning how to read . 
  did n't sweden invade during the deluge ? 
  should n't they be on the map as well ? 
  that song is appropriately epic . 
  of course he 'd say that . 
  he 's a far-right american conservative , so of course he 'd claim that hitler was the opposite . 
  everyone does this , no-one wants to be close to hitler on the political spectrum for obvious reasons . 
  you 're doing it now , in fact . 
  we do n't even have to talk about nazis . 
  you ** elected donald trump ** . 
  that speaks volumes about your `` enforcement of social values '' and `` education system '' . 
   lomnicky stit and a series of unfortunate events ? ... 
  miliband was a worse party leader than corbyn is . 
  corbyn is just far more personable , and at the moment that seems to be important . 
  at the same time , the safest seats in this election are some of the safest seats in the history of british politics . 
  your mp 's majority is one thousandth the size of mine . 
  that 's insane . 
  at the same time , my local mp now has a majority of 22.6 k. 
  do n't change it , it 's hilarious . 
  had a bad morning , needed something to cheer me up . 
  that url screams conspiracy and historical revisionism . 
   a mafia ** mascaraing ** as lol , they 're the mafia but they 've put eyeliner on to pretend that they 're a country . 
  well , la pen is against macron . 
  pretty sure she wo n't be the next french president . 
  `` i 'm correct !, 
  if you disagree , you ca n't be thinking critically ! '', 
  at least pretend to conduct conversations with a bit of decorum , please . 
  i know it 's a sensitive topic but we 're all better than this . 
  `` this person disagrees with me so they 're a zombie personally controlled by juncker !,
