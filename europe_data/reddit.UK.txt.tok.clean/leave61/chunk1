devolution . 
  ok , but then why is it ridiculous for the snp to control ** scottish parliament ** , then ? 
  if england overwhelmingly voted ukip , ukip would 've won english parliament . 
  hey !, 
  i want to stay in the eu as well as 16 + million people . 
  it 's a glitch for now ... #eu army, 
  scotland is a country in the uk . 
  blame england , not scotland . 
  you forced japan and germany to give up their military and copy you . 
  also , you made ww2 worse by getting involved in it for your own exploits as a way to bolster your economy and forced the uk into debt . 
  ww2 did n't need the usa to come in . 
  yes your government did . 
  if you did n't get involved with the middle east for their oil , it would be far more stable and europe would n't have to deal with all these refugees . 
  do n't try to be the world police , fix your own country before thinking you can fix other countries . 
  well , europe does n't want to have experience refugees from instability caused by the ** us government ** . 
  this is a very sad situation and so many people in this thread are being so hateful . 
  sometimes , i lose my faith in humanity . 
  if you do n't see it , it does n't matter . 
  live your life without worrying about what one person on the internet said . 
  'cause you 're from germany . 
  this includes germany , too , you know ? 
  like / u/tortademilanesa said , the uk has gotten used to people from its former colonies going to the uk , but since the late 2000s , the south asians ( islamic terrorism , personally , i blame the middle-eastern `` interventions '' and saudi arabia ) have gotten worse , but the caribbeans have gotten better , so white british people are mostly fine with them . 
  poland , however , was n't part of the british empire , and have only started coming to the uk in large droves in the 2000s , so the white british are n't used to them , yet , but it 's getting better , or at least it was , until brexit when many british people ( white and otherwise ) seem to be becoming more out-racist to eastern europeans ; it 's sad . 
  so , they got paid # 73 , you mean ? 
  i wonder why eastern ( geographically ) half of europe support jobs being reserved for nationals , but the western half do n't ? 
  the european governments must make that happen . 
  also , those videos can stop being so influential by assimilating them making them less `` muslim '' and more atheist . 
  the same thing has happened to europe as it 's slowly becoming less christian and more atheist . 
  this is why the refugees need to be spread out throughout germany and their children must go to the local schools to force them to assimilate . 
  as winston churchill once said : `` the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter . '', 
  they are n't spread out as much as they should be . 
  many turks in germany live in turkish ghettos . 
  it 's still ridiculous . 
  i think it was due to the german government not forcing them to assimilate by banning faith schools and spreading the turks throughout germany . 
  you know , when you spread the butter too thin , you taste more bread than butter . 
  in this case , they become more german than turkish . 
  how ? 
  they are supporting a leader who is slowly turning turkey authoritarian . 
  anyone who supports democracy would n't support erdogan . 
  this is why education is so important . 
  we need to teach people why these artefacts are important to every country 's history . 
  who in their `` democratic '' mind would think erdogan is democratic ? 
  do n't they realise that if they went back to turkey , erdogan would be targeting them for being `` not muslim enough '' ? 
  erdogan is a horrible leader for turkey , forgetting that it 's supposed to be a secular country . 
  do they seriously think erdogan supports democracy ? 
  b * tch , please . 
  to be honest , the us and uk governments should n't have declared war on iraq for non-existent wmds . 
  it was a horrible decision that started islamic terrorism by spreading wahabism . 
  if the us and the uk governments are going to intervene in the middle east , they should overthrow the saudi arabian monarchy to stop the spread of wahabism and terrorism . 
  or they are more likely to be caught . 
  did you know 35 % of murders in the us are unsolved ? 
  the u.s. police force is useless . 
  exactly , no one knows when and where it was first created . 
  but the first record , which historians care most about , was in moscow when genoese ambassadors brought it to moscow . 
  they are similar rates . 
  white-on-white homicide rates are similar to black-on-black homicide rates in the us . 
  also , black people are more likely to be caught committing crimes than white people in the us . 
  same reason why white-americans and black-americans smoke marijuana at similar rates , but black-americans are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana . 
  https://www.aclu.org/report/war-marijuana-black-and-white it 's because black communities , tending to be in dense inner-city areas , are more policed than white communities . 
  i think that 's mainly due to them wanting to be independent or to join georgia , as they 're closer to the georgians than the russians . 
  you mean circassia ? 
  i think that 's mainly due to them wanting to be independent or to join georgia since they 're closer to them than russians . 
  they are very well integrated . 
  mainly because a lot of them are poor and uneducated , you see the same thing in poor white-american communities . 
  anyway , my argument was / u/segull was suggesting that the russians should do whatever they want , even if it hurts minorities . 
  also , i understand they are americans , but i usually use americans for the `` first-americans '' , and white - , african - , asian - , hispanic - , etc for the others . 
  except  a type of distilled liquor designated by the russian word vodka came to russia in the late 14th century . 
  in 1386 , the genoese ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae ( `` the water of life '' ) to moscow and presented it to grand duke dmitry donskoy . 
  the liquid obtained by distillation of grape must was thought to be a concentrate and a `` spirit '' of wine ( spiritus vini in latin ) , from where came the name of this substance in many european languages ( like english spirit , or russian \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0442 , spirt ) . 
  the first record of vodka is in moscow , in the 14th century . 
  i thought drinking vodka was the russian rite of passage ? 
  to be honest , they were also targeting the dutch asylum policies at the time . 
  ok , calm down . 
  if they ca n't accept equality in europe , they should n't be here . 
  i thought people were taught to be respectful to your hosts ? 
  when i go to a foreign country , i attempt to learn the language and try to take part in the culture . 
  vodka is amazing, 
  hey , he 's a grower , not a show-er . 
  yeah , let 's kill african-americans !, 
  that seems like what america wants !, 
  even though the long-established ( centuries long ) muslim communities of tatars have been very well integrated into russia . 
  they just want a scapegoat . 
  war unites us all !, 
  ( sadly , i 'm in britain ), 
  no deaths with the rara attacks , and they were to protest against apartheid in south africa , although they should gone about it in a peaceful way . 
  land of the prisoners and the home of inequality !, 
  yeah, 
  oh , that 's nice of you guys . 
  they 're not estonians , they 're guests until they learn the language and identify as estonian-syrian or whatever . 
  they may , but at the start , they 're unlikely to . 
  what if they say they can only get jobs close to the neighbourhood they live in , and they must live in the neighbourhood for at least 1 year ( unless they get evicted ) to get ` indefinite leave to remain ' . 
  with a year , they refugee adults would learn basic proficiency of the language with classes and the refugee children would play with the estonian children and learn the language from them , meaning they would assimilate somewhat , but , obviously , it will take a generation . 
  when they 're earning enough , yes . 
  but when they 're refugees there at the behest of the government , they should spread them out . 
  that 's really interesting . 
  i think if more refugees assimilated , most europeans would probably have no problems with them . 
  but the best way to get them to assimilate is to spread them out throughout the country so they 'll be forced to assimilate . 
  then it 's best for estonia to take in family refugees so the children assimilate easily . 
  single people may be good as they could marry an estonian and their children would be have estonian and after a few generations they would be mostly estonian . 
  obviously , i know this sounds like brazil 's policies to whiten their black population .
