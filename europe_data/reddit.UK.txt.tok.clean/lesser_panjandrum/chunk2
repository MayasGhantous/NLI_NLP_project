  edit : not saying that this is how things actually work , just imagining a ridiculous situation in which people are entirely reduced to looks alone .

  i 'm not sure how setting police cars on fire is going to do much to change financial policies . 
  if anything it detracts from the actual protest message , because it 's easy to write off rioters as violent idiots . 
  well that sounds like a fun little subreddit full of pictures of cute raccoons and - oh .

  quick , call farage before the immigrants swoop in and steal all our jobs and women !, 
  the modern state is based on its monopoly on the legitimate use of huge boxer guys .

  it was a sign that de gaulle 's administration did n't want to cooperate with nato in military matters , independent from working in the eec .
