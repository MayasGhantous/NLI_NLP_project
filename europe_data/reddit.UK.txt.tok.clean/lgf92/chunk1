i 'm fairly certain we tried this about 1000 years ago and it just led to a series of wars , civil and otherwise . 
  it 's not hypocritical : we have put up money to ensure financial stability in the eu before and we want debts to be paid to us before we shell out . 
  i 'm pro-eu but some eu member states annoy me in their attitude towards the eu 's second-biggest economy . 
  the safe word is `` novorossiya '', 
  britain has military bases in germany , does n't mean that it gives us the right to just up and invade to defend the sovereign rights of our brave troops stationed there . 
  it 's just a coincidence that all these concerned civilians happen to have apache helicopters and sa-80 rifles . 
   pretty much sums up the uk 's stance on europe ~ ~ at the moment ~ ~ since the early 1970s . 
  ftfy, 
  from my experience , britons in spain tend to form their own little british ghettos on the costa del sol where they can buy fried breakfast , refuse to learn spanish and hopelessly fail to integrate into spain , all the while complaining that britain is `` going to hell in a handcart '' cos of all the immigrants . 
  that said , i do n't think britons who emigrate to other countries tend to that ( france , for example ) . 
  at least # 100m of our eu tax bill will go into special machines to press the union jack into hot dough so that france is reminded who 's feeding it . 
  we 're suing you for infringing on our `` serious , dark-humoured eccentric yet economically sensible european nation '' copyright . 
  yeah , british anti-eu arguments are n't usually as nuanced as shown in the video . 
  they are concerned russian citizens protecting the massive russian-speaking minority in poland . 
  no invasion here . 
  even now , england and wales share tonnes of stuff including a legal system - solicitors here are qualified `` in england and wales '' . 
  did n't we invite william of orange to take over the kingdom ? 
  they should really teach us about the glorious revolution in schools , it 's kind of important .

  we have a similar one in newcastle in the uk :  a hurricane and earthquake simultaneously hit sunderland this morning , wiping out the city centre and causing over # 45 in improvements . 
  if you have a memory of a night out in newcastle you have obviously done something wrong . 
  they landed at the airport with oddly russian looking military uniforms on and they 're telling us we have to vote in a referendum next week . 
  the only modern political entity i can find that scotland fought but not england was the [ isle of man in 1275 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_ronaldsway ) .

  if you did that we could add a lot of the balkan states and cyprus as well . 
  as such , i think the only countries we have n't fought an all out war against are belgium , the baltic states and greece . 
  the argentinian government did n't expect britain to put up a serious defence of the islands , considering they were pretty worthless at the time and we were scaling down our armed forces as the cold war cooled off . 
  they thought we would negotiate and perhaps offer them a progressive handover of the islands while we removed our assets from there . 
  what they did n't count on , however , was the fact that maggie t was looking like losing the 1983 election as the sdp rose and the economy tanked , and a nice patriotic war was good for the approval ratings . 
  we would say one of the `` american president '' or the `` president of the us '' . 
  i 'm geordie  british  european  english . 
  i tend to side much more strongly with my regional identity than with my national identity . 
  this is a really quick translation : in the summer of 1993 the russian emergencies ministry , after being authorised by georgian authorities , sent a column of trucks with `` humanitarian aid '' to tkvarcheli , which , as agreed , were not inspected by the georgians . 
  so the emergencies ministry brought a large number of firearms , ammunition ( including artillery shells ) , which were used by abkhazian separatists in september 1993 for the blockade and takeover of sukhumi . 
  in this photo , taken in that summer in sukhumi , the current russian defence minister , shoigu . 
  in those days he was the leader of the ministry of emergencies , and during this operation in charge of `` humanitarian aid '' , and gave weapons to the separatists . 
  alongside him are giya karkarashvili , at that time a georgian army commander , and geno adamiya , commander of the 23rd brigade of the georgian ministry of defence , based in sukhumi ( he was killed in sukhumi after the city was occupied ) . 
  yeah well the north sea is our favourite so there  :( except not , because beyond it lie *** continentals *** . 
  riga 's old city was completely destroyed by soviet shelling then reconstructed in the 1990s . 
  if you look at the picture , none of those buildings are older than 20 . 
  to the extent of funding republican terror organisations and giving them arms through the 60s and 70s it seems ... 
  http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/food/international-market/bilateral-trade-overview/index_en.htm in any case food exports to russia are sub-7 % of the eu 's food exports , so it 's hardly going to destroy our agriculture . 
  it does n't really matter where they come from , the subsidies stay the same ( that was / u/xdey 's point ) . 
  any massive loss that would be caused by russian sanctions is cushioned by an eu subsidy safety net . 
  even with sanctions , it still means that agriculture is profitable as the eu subsidies effectively make up the money lost by russian sanctions . 
  we could always double bluff them , agree with the need for a peacekeeping mission and start proposing a joint nato-russian peacekeeping force ? 
  i ' l sure that they 'd back down soon enough out of politeness .

  i think it 's that pro-eu people in the uk are the silent majority . 
  the eurosceptics are much better at getting their voices heard because they have an easier argument to shout . 
  i was clicking through and waiting to wince at the woefully low uk number , then was pleasantly surprised . 
  [ polandball can always into relevant ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hgzmb30.png ), 
   if putin kept his word have we not learned by now that expecting vlad to play nice is a stupid idea ? 
  no amount of eu sanctions would have got weapons out of ukraine once the russians smelled blood when we were powerless to act on crimea . 
  short of a full on peacekeeping operation , which will never happen while russia is a unsc permanent member , nothing within our power would have stopped this happening . 
  will that stop russia though ? 
  can you not conceive how their well oiled propaganda machine would spin that as european aggression ? 
  their country economically collapsed through the nineties and it does n't seem to stop them . 
  the government would only spin it as `` heroic president putin stands up against european aggressors who want to starve russia '' . 
  if wwii taught us anything it was russia 's sheer stubbornness in the face of abysmal conditions . 
  an unfortunate generalisation on my part . 
  the `` rebels '' should not have these weapons systems but what can the eu do ? 
  we do n't want world war iii , we do n't want to freeze to death in winter ( we do n't want to pay any more for domestic electricity generation ) , and putin has shown time and time again that he will do whatever the fuck he wants no matter what europe does . 
  what more could we feasibly have done ? 
  this plane would have been shot down today , eu action or no eu action , and it 's just a tragic wrong-place-wrong-time thing , considering the rebels seemed to think they were shooting at a turboprop that ca n't fly that fast or that high . 
  let 's not get carried away , some fucking pumped up `` novarossiya '' moron with an anti aircraft gun that he was irresponsibly given and no radar training was the ultimate cause of this accident . 
  that 's what you get when you play at soldiers , and when you pump weapons into a volatile region . 
  remember that we 've been funding syrian opposition for the best part of a year and i certainly do n't think that 's helped to calm down the conflict . 
  it 's just a shame that the idiots who caused this will never be brought to justice . 
  hey europe , ever considered buying north sea gas ? 
  british opportunism , eddie , best in the world . 
  all those resistance guns and suicidal raids on the channel ports though ...

  well i study linguistics and specifically etymology as part of my degree ( with an emphasis on french loan words into english post-norman invasion ) so i feel i 'm qualified to talk about this . 
  you seem incapable of getting my point ; i am not contesting that `` colour '' eventually has a latin etymology . 
  what i am saying is that that latin etymology has nothing to do with english spelling as we did not take it directly from latin but rather from french . 
  it also has nothing to do with the change to american spelling - webster wanted to simplify spelling , not return it to some purist classical route . 
  if he had wanted to , he would n't have spelt `` encyclopedia '' , removing the latin ae diagraph . 
  so while you are right in claiming that colour/color do eventually come from latin origins , the claim that the american variant is directly from latin is not correct . 
  it 's a simplified spelling of an english word of french origin , eventually of latin origin . 
  we use the word `` connoisseur '' all the time despite the modern french version being `` connaisseur '' as we adopted it before french spelling reforms . 
  there 's no question of `` purity '' or `` being the original '' . 
  i eagerly await the ridicule in / r/iamverysmart for talking about my degree subject .

  there 's a section on the paper for each party with a list of their candidates , you mark an x to the right of the one you 're voting for . 
  the word `` colour '' did not come into english from latin . 
  it came into french and we took it from french with the additional `` o '' they had added in to reflect pronunciation . 
  you really do n't seem to have a good idea of how linguistics work and why it 's so ridiculous to claim that the us version is `` using the original '' - the `` ae '' spelling of words like encyclopaedia , paedophile is the latin original and yet you got rid of that .
