  syrup with still water for us is called ` squash ' or ` cordial ' . 
  i do n't even think `` bottled spunk '' [ is the worst slogan they used ] ( https://johnlyle.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/dasanisite.jpg ) . 
  it 's honestly not as easy as that . 
  britain is largely facing the following problems post-brexit : * deadlock : our government wo n't trigger article 50 until we can have something of a plan for negotations ; the eu wo n't negotiate until we 've triggered article 50 . 
  stalemate , basically , with each side trying to set new dates for negotiations to begin , as one side will have to blink first for this to happen . 
  * trade : within that two year period we need to get put in place a trade agreement/provisional trade relationship . 
  these deals are hugely complicated and require negotiations on literally thousands of economic sectors . 
  the eu-canada deal has taken the best part of 10 years , and that was for an economy that is much less integrated into the eu market and a deal which does n't concern as many sectors . 
  consider as well that the uk 's trade policy has been created collaboratively in the eu for the last 40 years , and we basically do n't have any trade negotiators whatsoever . 
  things get even more complicated by the fact that the eu is continuing its work in our ` absence ' - for example the digital single market is coming in in the next couple of years , adding even more complexity to the deal . 
  the only way we can really solve this is by agreeing a similar deal to what we have now and perhaps negotiating elements of it down the line , or by delaying brexit for a number of years ( in which case , why are we leaving anyway ? ), 
  * law : we 've been implementing eu law into our national law for the last 40 years as well , to the point that huge areas of our law ( e.g. 
  employment , redundancy , consumer law ) are effectively british laws which gloss eu directives . 
  these have to be untangled and replaced , or left in place ( in which case why are we leaving anyway ? ), 
  * political consequences : delaying a brexit will ( presumably ) have worsening effects on any government which puts it off and puts it off , which it more or less has to do . 
  any government which is willing to trigger a ` hard brexit ' and crash out of the eu will no doubt see severe economic damage in the short-to-medium term which will , in turn , lead to the same effects as if they were just delaying the brexit ( in which case , why are we leaving anyway ? ) . 
  * status of eu nationals : we have no idea what the government 's policy is going to be on immigration , free movement , etc. 
  we do know that the eu has said `` no single market without free movement of persons '' . 
  the government is trying to respond to people 's immigration concerns while coming round to the reality that limiting immigration means a much more complex negotiated brexit , adding yet more work onto what is already a hugely complicated deal . 
  tl ; dr the two-year time period imposed by article 50 ( which can be extended , but only unanimously , and in any case what incentive does the eu have to do that ? ), 
  is n't enough to beat out anything other than a deal which resembles wholly or partly what we have now . 
  i think if we get through 2017 with no article 50 being triggered it might well be the case that the parties will fight out what to do at a general election . 
  any option where we trigger article 50 in the next year or so will lead to a hard or semi-hard brexit , or a decade of negotiations . 
  most of our jokes are around places like [ hull ] ( http://www.aeroengland.co.uk/hull.jpg ) , [ grimsby ] ( https://photos.smugmug.com/eastcoast/grimsby-and-cleethorpes/i-r7n9qqz/3/l/grimsby_aerial-2-l.jpg ) , [ scunthorpe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/scunthorpe.jpg ) just because they have somewhat depressing-sounding names . 
  i 've heard a lot of towns in the northwest such as [ oldham ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4x6sax5.jpg ) , wigan , st helens and blackburn being mentioned as kind of hellish rundown ex-industrial towns . 
  equally [ middlesbrough ] ( http://www.tenpennydreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/middlesbrough.jpg ) and cleveland in the northeast , and places like [ merthyr tydfil ] ( http://c8.alamy.com/comp/b70gw5/rows-of-houses-on-a-hillside-in-the-town-of-merthyr-tydfil-wales-b70gw5.jpg ) and newport in wales . 
  [ milton keynes ] ( http://mjconstructiongroup.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/thecentremk-exterior-1.jpg ) is also a running joke as it was a new town built from scratch after the war and has a reputation as being a little soulless . 
  i 've heard the same said about coventry as it too was mostly rebuilt after the war . 
  when i was younger glasgow used to be painted as the scariest place in britain but it 's lost some of its reputation as it has genuinely become a nicer place to live . 
  edit : it 's not just the north that has hellish industrial towns - luton gets made fun of as well . 
  our `` option '' was usually to jump up and down on top of the rubbish until it fit in the bin or put all the heavy stuff on top ... 
  i 'm sure there are people who you could hire to take it away but the cost would have been disproportionate . 
  there certainly are n't private companies dedicated to picking up regular rubbish that i 'm aware of . 
  [ these guys ] ( http://www.wasteconcern.com/ ) say they 're the `` only '' ones that do it so there obviously is n't that much of a market . 
  i think it 's just a europe/us division on the provision of services by the state . 
  i have n't had many complaints , especially in london , but when i lived in the rural-ish north the council never had enough money , and they would only collect a bin every two weeks , and not at all if the bin was too full . 
  this meant that sometimes you had rubbish sitting around for six or eight weeks while you desperately tried to reduce the amount of rubbish you produced so that they would take it away . 
  or you 'd bag it up and drop it into public bins . 
  saying that , for # 14 a week for all of your rubbish collection , roads , libraries , local council services etc. 
  it is n't bad at all . 
  if you fancy a thrilling read/more information , [ here 's my local council 's page on recycling and rubbish ] ( https://www.lbhf.gov.uk/recycling-and-rubbish ) . 
  in the uk , you pay `` council tax '' to your local council ( elected bodies which run things in a certain region ) which includes provision for rubbish collection as well as things like maintaining the roads . 
  here in london , my council tax on a 2-bed flat is about # 1000 a year , of which about # 750 goes to the council and # 250 pays for the greater london authority - if you have a bigger house , the tax goes up , and the tax depends on where you live . 
  when i lived up north , you used to have two big [ wheelie bins ] ( http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ntawwduwma==/z/df0aaoxy63fs-0ri/$_35.jpg?set_id=2 ) - one for general rubbish , and one for ` dry ' recyclables ( i.e. 
  metals and paper ) . 
  you had to take glass to a separate bottle bank . 
  a truck would come round once a week and collect one of the bins , meaning that they got emptied every two weeks . 
  now , which seems to be more common in london , you bag things into general rubbish bags and mixed recycling bags and leave them out on the street on a certain night , where they 're picked up by the council 's ` bin lorries ' . 
  however , if you have something really big to get rid of which the binmen wo n't take ( e.g. 
  a sofa ) you have to take it to a tip ( landfill ) or pay someone to do it for you . 
  often the councils will do so , for a fee . 
  yeah , the main difference is where english uses a french-derived word that dutch would n't . 
  if you look at the dutch translation of the udhr :  alle mensen worden vrij en gelijk in waardigheid en rechten geboren . 
  you can almost do it with the cognate words in english ( although it sounds very odd ) , if you get rid of the dutch ` verb at the end ' grammar :  all men were born freely and alike in worth and rights . 
  they are gifted with [ forstanding ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/forstand ) and [ wit ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wit#english ) and it behooves them to behave in a [ spirit ] of brothership [ to ] each other . 
  i presume he 's distinguishing between the ira of the civil war period and the `` ira '' in the question op asked , the terrorist group that was active from the 60s onwards . 
  they definitely subtitle geordie shore sometimes , and i remember an episode of bouncers which took place in blyth in northumberland with subtitles throughout . 
  dutch and frisian are generally considered to be the most mutually intelligible with english , although if you count scots and ulster scots as distinct languages we obviously have more in common with those ones than we do with dutch . 
  i find that i can often get the gist of something in dutch by reading it even if i ca n't understand every word , and occasionally sentences in danish and norwegian . 
  words in french are also very mutually intelligible to the point that , as an english speaker , if you understand french grammar but have a poor vocabulary , you can read a lot of it through cognates . 
  lots of universities have bans on them iirc , or at least on `` single-sex dining clubs '' . 
  i remember a big fracas at edinburgh uni over a us fraternity which was trying to infiltrate and set up there . 
  i recommend [ this book ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/watching-english-hidden-rules-behaviour/dp/0340818867 ) to you . 
  i 'm reading it for the first time and , as someone english , it 's making me realise that a lot of the stuff we do and the way we think is really really weird . 
  this coming from the country that attempted to rename one of the national dishes because france would n't join the iraq war lol, 
   thanks , you 've admitted that europeans have an unhealthy obsession with america . 
  they take somethign completely arbitrary and harmless and never shut the fuck up about it . 
   lol i can sense your blood pressure through your comments . 
  i think you need to have a lie down . 
  what else do you want people to talk about in a thread about medicine advertisements other than medicine advertisements and their thoughts on them ? 
  it seems what you ca n't handle is opinions different to your own , hence why you furiously lash out at anyone who speaks up . 
  and that 's without mentioning camembert and kinder surprise !, 
  britain 's # 1 concern for young people is housing . 
  we 've had a huge rise in house prices in this country over the last 20 years which has put buying a house or flat out of reach of most young people until they 're much older . 
  to give you an example , my parents bought their house in 1991 for # 50,000 at around 3x their yearly salary . 
  if i wanted to buy it today on the average wage for someone in their mid twenties , it would be more like 9-10x yearly salary ( # 200,000 - # 250,000 ) . 
  in london and the south-east it 's even worse . 
  in the past , if you needed a house you could get one from the local council , but there was a massive selloff of local authority housing in the 1980s and 1990s that has n't been replaced . 
  we also have recently increased university tuition fees to # 9,000 a year which it 's feared will put poorer young people off going to university - but it 's really a `` graduate tax '' ( a low-interest loan that you only pay off through deductions from your salary ) and it does n't seem to affect university numbers ( although demographics may well be another story ) . 
  generally it 's ok . more young people work in professional and managerial work than our parents ' generation did , and i 'd say that even if the job security is n't as good as it was for our parents young people have more hope of progressing in their work nowadays . 
  britain changed its vehicle plates around 2000 from the format a123 bcd to ab02 cde , so you can tell at least if a car is from this millennium . 
  out and about it 's getting rarer and rarer to see the old numberplates , but you still see them a few times a day , mostly s-y reg which is the mid-to-late 90s . 
  earlier than that is rare unless you hang around vintage car shows , although you will occasionally see an old classic car driving around . 
  i 'd guess most cars you see are from somewhere between 05 reg to 09 reg . 
  most british cars made in the 70s are n't really roadworthy - british leyland and other manufacturers were n't known for their quality . 
  i did high school history in the uk between 2005 and 2010 - we did n't do any american history in primary school . 
  we studied some american history insofar as it related to britain - limited to studying the slave trade and abolitionism in a uk context . 
  we did n't cover anything like the war of independence , the war of 1812 or anything about the american colonies really - but we get a lot of american historical tropes from watching american films and cartoons . 
  this was to the extent that when i came to study something about canadian colonial history for my degree i realised that i knew next to nothing about the history of the americas in that period . 
  as such you 'll find that many people in britain could n't tell you anything about the war of 1812 but they know vaguely what thanksgiving is . 
  my school also elected for us to study prohibition at a-level for an essay module but i think we were somewhat rare in that regard . 
  i would say we study nazi germany and the ussr more than we studied the usa . 
  then again , i 'd reckon what you learn about british history is around the same . 
  do n't forget [ intentionally obstructing a person from entering premises where he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that there are or have been any bees ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/12/section/2 ) . 
  i 'd suggest james ii . 
  the glorious revolution was really the founding of the modern british state with parliament supreme , and his puritanical breed of dictatorship led to parliament inviting william of orange to come and dispose of him . 
  that said , that almost certainly could n't have happened if parliament had n't been emboldened from defeating charles i , who was certainly more openly dictatorial . 
  begging has been illegal in the uk since [ 1824 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vagrancy_act_1824 ) . 
  of course , it 's loosely enforced in terms of criminal penalties , but the police will move on anyone found begging in the street . 
   ... and every person wandering abroad , or placing himself or herself in any public place , street , highway , court , or passage , to beg or gather alms , or causing or procuring or encouraging any child or children so to do , shall be deemed an idle and disorderly person within the true intent and meaning of this act ; and it shall be lawful for any justice of the peace to commit such offender ... to the house of correction , there to be kept to hard labour for any time not exceeding one calendar month .
