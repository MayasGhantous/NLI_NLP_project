  regarding your `` k '' argument , you 'll notice that the morphemes `` ka '' `` kl '' and `` kw '' all have pronunciations . 
  the pronunciation of `` kn '' is `` n '' , hence the pattern in words like knight , knave , etc. 
  which were pronounced in middle english as ` k-night ' ( knecht ) and ` k-nave ' ( knabe ) due to their germanic roots but changed in the intermittent period . 
  til there are two ways to spell scallywag , the american way and the correct way . 
  \\  claims to speak the `` true english '' \\  ca n't spell `` scallywags '' \\  3/10, 
  nice google work there to find out a measurement in celsius . 
  bro do you even alt +135 \u00e7.\u00e7, 
  looking at most countries , it seems to have been the case that poland was at least top 3 in televoting , and only lost out due to the juries . 
  music snobbery i say !, 
  hey it 's actually a harsh critique of materialism , honest !, 
  * * j'ai peut-\u00eatre tout c'est vrai mais * * moi je voulais une moustache , une moustache ... * english : something 's missing , but what ? 
  i want this , i want that , when i dream , i dream in dollars every day i have a new co-star at home everything 's great outside the world is crying i do n't really care i live on the top floor , do n't even know my housemaid there 's leather in my car and the smell of my cologne makes me feel better i do n't like to show my emotions in the weight room i lift a few dumbbells my body 's a real weapon of war i 've everything you could dream of having sure , i have everything , but what i wanted was a moustache , a moustache ... 
  austria 's was definitely `` best of the ballads '' , followed by norway ( did n't know where all of the votes for montenegro came from ) . 
  the netherlands were definitely more original . 
  last country attempt i remember was a horrendous german one in 2006 ( ? ), 
  two world wars , one world cup , one eurovision , etc. 
  to his credit , [ 58.5 % of people in crimea are ethnic russians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimea#demographics ) . 
  it 's not a question of `` belief '' . 
  edit : i should point out that i think that the invasion of crimea was a ridiculous violation of international law , i 'm just pointing out that it 's wrong to claim that there are n't loads of russians in crimea . 
  they are literally representing their country on the international stage . 
  they 're not responsible for the invasion of crimea , but they are the literal embodiment of russia at the eurovision song contest . 
  of course they were going to get booed . 
  the lyrics were quite good , but as philistine as it sounds , i think france 's insistence on singing in french holds it back . 
  without a superb beat/melody you ca n't win on tune alone , and more people understand english than french in europe nowadays . 
  the last non-english winner was molitva in 2007 . 
  netherlands were interesting ( a country song that was n't cliche or forced ) , armenia 's was certainly listenable , i liked the d&b in hungary , and the norwegian guy had a great voice . 
  ditto britain . 
  but i 've noticed a pattern in the voting : as we 're english-first-language , we tend to vote quite differently from the rest of the continent as we dismiss songs with pretty meaningless english lyrics ( switzerland , azerbaijan , sweden ) and tend to go for well-written or familiar things like malta and belgium instead . 
  i was surprised we did n't give france or poland anything . 
  last month their broadcasters ( who give them the right to participate in the esc ) received and published petitions stating that conchita wurst would turn the esc into a `` hotbed of sodomy '' . 
  great news to stick it in russia and belarus ' face , but it definitely was n't the best song in the contest . 
  it was kind of a cliche bond theme . 
  france got mauled , surprisingly , considering their song was quite fun . 
  the netherlands probably had the best song , and i dunno where all sweden 's votes came from cos theirs was quite dull as well . 
  armenia and hungary were two songs that i would have bet on to win eurovision , they just had the `` trashy but proud club anthem sound '' . 
  credit to poland for the least taken-seriously song of the contest , and further credit to italy for confirming berlusconi 's involvement in the jury by awarding poland 10 points . 
  edit : [ here are some lovely comments from the announcement on ria novosti ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rz6yg1z.png ) 1 . 
  sodom and gomorrah !, 
  shame on europe !, 
  one continuous propaganda-fest !, 
  she won on her talent ? 
  hahaha !, 
  this content should be restricted to 18 + , so that kids ca n't see it . 
  horrible . 
  if you met her , you 'd get a fright !, 
  the new face of europe ... / 5 . 
  i 'm not going to waste any more time on eurovision . 
  never !, 
  i would never have believed that so many people would have voted in reality for this . 
  i ca n't believe it . 
  it 's too much . 
  it was poor form from the crowd , but russia 's was n't a great song ( quite boring in fact ) and probably deserved to be lower than the 7th it finished . 
  very few british politicians have doctorates or masters degrees , not counting the oxford/cambridge/dublin ma which is automatically conferred on all ba students from those universities after a certain time , or the scottish ma hons , which is a ba plus one year conferred by the ` ancient ' universities of st andrews , edinburgh , glasgow , dundee and aberdeen . 
  in the 2010 parliament , 24 % of mps studied at either oxford or cambridge . 
  only 21 of them have doctorates : greg clark , ** minister of state for cities and constitution ** ( conservative , royal tunbridge wells ) - phd , economics , london school of economics ( 1989 ) therese coffey ( conservative , suffolk coastal ) - phd , chemistry , university college london ( 1997 ) kwasi kwarteng ( conservative , spelthorne ) - phd , economic history , cambridge ( 1998 ) oliver letwin , ** minister of state for policy ** ( conservative , west dorset ) - phd , philosophy , oxford ( 1982 ) julian lewis ( conservative , new forest east ) - dphil , strategic studies , oxford ( 1981 ) david lidington , ** minister for europe ** , phd , history , cambridge ( 1988 ) jesse norman ( conservative , hereford and south herefordshire ) , phd , philosophy , university college london ( 2003 ) matthew offord ( conservative , hendon ) , phd , geography , kings college london ( 2011 ) john redwood ( conservative , wokingham ) , dphil , history , oxford ( 1975 ) caroline lucas ( greens , brighton pavilion ) , phd , english and women 's studies , university of exeter ( 1989 ) roberta blackman-woods ( labour , city of durham ) , phd , social science , university of ulster ( 1979 ) gordon brown ( labour , kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath ) , phd , history , university of edinburgh ( 1982 ) stella creasy ( labour , walthamstow ) , phd , social psychology , london school of economics ( 2006 ) jon cruddas ( labour , dagenham and rainham ) , phd , industrial and business studies , warwick university ( 1991 ) hywel francis ( labour , aberavon ) , phd , history , uow swansea ( 1979 ) tristram hunt , ** shadow secretary of state for education ** ( labour , stoke-on-trent central ) , phd , history , cambridge ( 2000 ) gregg mcclymont , ** shadow minister for pensions ** ( labour , cumbernauld , kilsyth and kirkintilloch east ) , dphil , history , oxford ( 2006 ) alan whitehead ( labour , southampton test ) , phd , political science , university of southampton ( 1976 ) vince cable , ** secretary of state for business , innovation and skills ** ( lib dem , twickenham ) , phd , economics , university of glasgow ( 1973 ) julian huppert ( lib dem , cambridge ) , phd , biological chemistry , cambridge ( 2005 ) eilidh whiteford ( snp , banff and buchan ) , phd , scottish literature , glasgow ( 1998 ), 
  here in britain we appreciate a dislike of the svenskjavlar after the whole viking thing, 
  it was a `` this europe lark is n't as bad as it 's made out to be '' quip . 
  yeah , the liege waffle ( the one in the picture ) has like crystallised sugar baked into it so it 's quite sweet as is . 
  and yet people still insist on voting ukip in the uk , we 're missing out . 
  especially considering the fee i paid included luggage , it was n't much more expensive than ryanair or easyjet . 
  and it was to national rather than charleroi . 
  it 's just a rare thing to get value for your money these days !, 
  here for a week !, 
  oddly enough i was in canada on an exchange last year ... are you past me ? 
  i 'm in a bar in the city centre having a kriek ( cherry beer ) , will smith 's * miami * has just come on and it 's 16c . 
  brussels is rapidly climbing my ` favourite places in europe ' list . 
  $ 94 return . 
  i loved it !, 
  it was a great touch on a flight ( edinburgh-brussels ) that was n't even two hours long . 
  considering it was like $ 70 without luggage on ryanair i decided to ` splash out ' as it were . 
  there was n't a whole load of legroom but a fresh ( ish ) waffle was a nice ` welcome to belgium ' . 
  edit : i 've reread the title and it looks like i 'm criticising the ` meal ' ... au contraire i thought it was great , especially at 6am . 
  i just wish there 'd been beer to accompany it ... 
  hence why i pay # 688 a month for it i suppose . 
  i pay # 688 a month with all my food included ... and i would n't say that my accommodation is at least 15.09 x better than this .

  let us have this victory germany , you got the good economy and the good football team , the past is all we have left . 
  ^ ^ ^ orsowewantyoutothink also , the phantom goal which unfairly won you the quarter final in 2010 means our goal in the 66 world final totally stands . 
  and gareth southgate let you win at wc 1990 aaas a reunification present . 
  you know what they say ... two world wars and one world cup !, 
  number 1 is in england , 2 , 3 and 4 are all scottish , and 5 is welsh . 
  never mind the double l. . . what about the quadruple l in there ? 
  1 in every 8 people were actively involved in the resistance which was characterised by non-violence and passive resistance , and you had the audacity to strike and refuse to work under the nazis in february 41 ... 1700 dutch sailed across the north sea to volunteer to spy for england and you had 1,100 underground newspapers running during the war . 
  that and the massive parade when the brits liberated amsterdam ... 
  thanks for clearing it up , as i said , i was n't sure !, 
  i think they abbreviate it to `` llanfair '' or `` llanfairpwllgwyn '' as it 's an artificially-lengthened name invented in the 18th century !, 
  just as people from 's - hertogenbosch call it `` den bosch '' , 
  to be fair , i come from the country with such spectacular place names as westward ho ! , twatt , drumnadrochit , auchtermuchty and llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch . 
  * one of our fellow monarchies in europe , although i 'm not sure whether they have the widespread support that our monarchy does . 
  * they love eating chips ( fries ) with mayonnaise * they speak really good english , although it helps that english and dutch are similar to an extent * they have very progressive laws on sex and drugs in general ( compared to somewhere like the usa or ireland ) * they 're very flat and are fucked if global warming happens on a large scale * windmills , tulips , clogs , etc. 
  * geert wilders is a prick * large immigrant communities , especially from dutch ex-colonies like suriname * great footballers , punch above their weight to make up for a middling domestic league * fun , laid back , easy going but often quite smart when it comes down to brass tacks * they love cycling * they had a badass resistance during wwii * they get sore throats from saying `` g '' all the time * they have funny place names like 's - hertogenbosch * `` oh man , in the eighties , we made so many guilders , one time , i have a porsche and a motorbike also ! '', 
  * they really do n't like germany * they share our ambivalence towards belgium * oranjeeeeeeeeeeeeeee [ also our deputy prime minister is fluent in dutch ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6k91lljt-i ), 
  remember also that at our border checkpoint in calais we regularly hand over illegal immigrants who try to sneak into the uk in the back of lorries over to the french police , who then release them so they can try again tomorrow . 
  each country unfortunately wants to look out for its own interests , not its neighbours ' . 
  `` but it happens '' is n't a valid legal defense . 
  we prosecuted a dutch military attach\u00e9 in 1989 for spying on us . 
  yeah , what he has done is treason under us laws , but remember that what the us did by bugging eu offices is espionage under eu law , so it 's not like the us government can take the high ground either . 
  france just ca n't get over the fact that they lost out in canada and they 're our bffs now .
