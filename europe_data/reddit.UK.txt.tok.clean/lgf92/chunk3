  if you think we 're becoming danish ( again ) you have another thing coming , 
  in all honesty , this is n't actually that bad an idea . 
  a long-term uk investment in cyprus in return for a few debt billions could lead to gas # # # in the next few years . 
  have n't you seen * house of cards * ? 
  i met the british ambassador to kyrgyzstan and she speaks brilliant russian and middling kyrgyz , it 's perhaps lower-level diplomats who have n't been in post as long who are linguistically incompetent . 
  also as a beginner-level student of kyrgyz it 's not radically different from turkish and once you get over the major differences from western european languages it 's not impossible . 
  the uk has very strict libel laws , at least if by ` strict ' you mean ` balanced in favour of the appellant ' . 
  it got to the point a few years ago where people were coming from overseas to get uk courts to issue an injunction . 
  they did reform it in 2013 but it 's still one of the most fearsome legal structures . 
  basically , the burden of proof is on the respondent ( the person said to have made the accusation ) . 
  it 's best explained as `` a is liable for saying anything to c about b which would be apt to make the average citizen think worse of the latter '' , where b is any named or identifiable person , company or legal entity . 
  the respondent ( the ` accused ' ) has three defences available to him : justification ( that the statement was true ) , fair comment ( that the statement is ' a view that a reasonable person could have held , even if they were motivated by dislike or hatred of the plaintiff ' ) or privilege ( that the statement was made in parliament or under oath in court ) . 
  if it is n't any of those things , and it would be enough to make a third party think less of the appellant , then the respondent is liable for damages . 
  the only thing that the appellant needs to prove is that there were special damages done to him , and even then he does n't have to do that in certain kinds of actionable slander , such as that making allegations of an offence which would be punishable with imprisonment . 
  basically if the court accepts that it is a defamatory statement and that the appellant suffered damages the person accused of making it has to prove one of those three things or they 're liable for damages . 
  the tabloids spin , but they 're very good at knowing when to stop * just short * of defaming someone . 
  uk libel law is such that daring to print allegations that you are n't ready to stand up in court and defend is very risky business indeed . 
  the mail must know that there is some legs in ashcroft 's story otherwise they would n't be risking a massive lawsuit for defamation ( unless it 's a ridiculous bluff-calling by ashcroft ) . 
  the burden in court would be on them to prove that it was n't defamation , not for cameron to prove that it was . 
  yeah , it 's one of the old `` golf '' and `` fuck '' canards that get trotted out when etymology is discussed . 
  the fact is that very few words are formed by taking an unwieldy initialism and reducing it to a single word - generally it has to be a term that ca n't be modified for convenience ( e.g. 
  laser , radar , scuba ) before that happens . 
  people were n't saying `` fornication under consent of the king '' then thought , wait , we can abbreviate this to ` fuck !, 
  ' , because you can easily rephrase the original phrase ( if it existed in fact ) . 
  i 'm a trainee solicitor with a major interest in human rights and refugee law , even though i do n't actually work in that field . 
  i 've also done some volunteer translation work for the unhcr in west africa which involved a lot of work with refugee documentation as well , so it 's just a very personal interest of mine and naturally when it comes up here i 'm keen to express myself . 
  britain has the exact same problem - hence why our government is desperately trying to keep immigration around 300,000 / year so that the pensions system does n't collapse in 20-30 years time while vaguely promising people that it will drop to 100,000 / year * soon * . 
  because if we do get to the point where the pyramid falls down on itself , whichever party is in power is going to have about 15 million people pissed off at it because they suddenly do n't have generous state pensions which they 'd been counting on . 
  a few weeks ago it was that poor british holidaymakers in kos were having their holidays ` ruined ' by having to watch migrants clambering onto the beaches from rickety boats , the poor dears . 
  british exceptionalism is still alive and kicking , unfortunately .

  in the [ 2003 heatwave ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_european_heat_wave ) the uk lost around 2,000 people prematurely in temperatures that were in the mid-30s , or at least lower than 38c . 
  [ 760 people died in the 2013 heatwave ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_heatwave_in_ireland_and_the_united_kingdom ) and that was somewhere between 31-35c . 
  35c is definitely enough to kill people who are sickly or elderly , although you 'd ask the question whether those people would be walking around concentration camps in the midday sun . 
  i just arrived in istanbul last night . 
  lol . 
  guess i 'm just going to have to be extra vigilant until i leave on wednesday morning . 
  yeah , you 're right , of the 23 discoveries made by british scientists , 7 of them were by cornish chemists . 
  that 's 1 discovery per 133,450 people in cornwall , making sweden 's puny 1 per 504,894 look tame in comparison . 
  cornwall innovative !, 
  two world wars and twenty-three chemical elements , doo dah , doo dah, 
  it 's definitely out of date for the uk , the [ ons reported from the 2011 census ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_310441.pdf ) that poles are # 1 ( 558,000 ) , then the irish ( 372,000 ) and then indians ( 315,000 ) - although that does n't include naturalised british citizens . 
  if you include naturalised brits then india goes back on top , but presumably only because there 's no real benefit for polish citizens in getting british citizenship . 
  in fact according to table 4 and figure 2 , less than 5 % of polish-born uk residents hold a british passport ( and that 's presumably the 5 % that arrived before 2004 ) whereas almost 60 % of people originally born in india who live in the uk do . 
  pilots are trained for that and a wing strike is n't always an emergency . 
  there was a turkish airlines flight that struck its wing as it landed at istanbul a few months ago , causing the engine to catch fire . 
  the pilots then gunned it along the runway , took off again ( with an engine on fire ) , switched off the engine , let it put itself out then they landed quite roughly . 
  no-one was injured . 
  it 's remarkable how well trained pilots are . 
  the dashes that flybe use are absolute wind traps , they get thrown around like paper planes in heavy wind . 
  i landed at brussels in one a couple of years ago and i was more or less resigned to the fact i was going to perish in a field in charleroi . 
  the central asian languages love them some phonemes , like the word '' \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0441\u044b\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0431\u044b '' ( salamatsyzdarby ) , which is kyrgyz for ` hello ' when speaking politely to a group of people . 
  i looked up `` nice to meet you '' in my kyrgyz dictionary , got '' \u0442\u0430\u0430\u043d\u044b\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0431\u0430\u043d\u044b\u0447\u0442\u0430\u043c\u044b\u043d '' ( taanyshkanyma kybanychtamyn ) and thought i 'd stick to russian instead . 
  also they use vowel harmony and have a mass of social registers , i mean just look at [ `` goodbye '' ] ( http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/kyrgyz.php ) on here . 
  dutch : weel , te ejn engelsprecher nederlands luuks quijt similajr te engels end te duits, 
  we might call them `` estates '' in the uk . 
  areas with nothing much except sub-standard housing that act as dormitories for city centres . 
  i suppose it 's different strokes for different countries . 
  personally i am glad of the benefit to british business and the infrastructure investment is welcome even if we are `` making a loss '' on it . 
  is it not the government 's role to spend money to provoke economic prosperity ? 
  cos that 's what our arrangement with the eu is . 
  we have received billions though , i was n't saying we 'd made a profit , simply that eu money has come in to the uk . 
  i stressed the primary investment of it in infrastructure projects , and you raised the secondary income which has been the massively beneficial free market . 
  if you include the secondary income we are probably in a profit of billions if not trillions from the eu . 
   not only the euro . 
  for thirty years spain has received billions from the eu ( and the cee before ) . 
  so has the uk . 
  and i wish people would fucking shout it louder because without the eu our science and technology industries and half of our cultural regeneration would be completely ruined . 
  france loves paperwork in a way that we seem to have forgotten in the english speaking world . 
  to get a train season ticket i had to go in person to the office with a signed form that i 'd printed off , two passport photos and they glued my photo onto a piece of card , laminated it and gave it back to me . 
  in britain i order it online and it comes to my door with the photo printed on it . 
  in a way i like it , it 's like a concrete , formal procedure ( as is common in france ) but sometimes it 's a pain in the arse . 
  [ about 3 % of all estates in the uk were eligible for inheritance tax in 2011-12 ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/340426/ihtnationalstatisticscommentarydocument.pdf ) . 
  this made [ # 3.402 bn ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/338949/140722table12-1duchecked.pdf ) for the uk government . 
  a large proportion of those taxed had the plurality of their income in securities ( figure 2 in the first document ) . 
  over 70 % of all inheritance tax comes from people with a net worth of over # 1 million ( figure 9 ) . 
  these are n't people who are struggling . 
  these are people who have amassed fortunes . 
  inheritance tax is wealth adjustment and people like that are the ones who should be targeted by it . 
  it 's so often in the rhetoric that people have worked hard for this money - well what exempts their children from working a little harder as well ? 
  an estate worth # 2m is taxed at 40 % over the threshold , meaning # 670k in tax . 
  that still leaves an estate worth over # 1.3 m. 
  hardly poverty is it . 
  when we 're ` having ' to cut # 12bn from the welfare budget , why the fuck are we more or less halving ( or worse ) this inheritance tax income ? 
  oh yeah , because the tories are using austerity as a cover for their ideological crusade against social mobility . 
  it 's not obvious when you have the media almost completely on side . 
  the bbc wo n't criticise the government and all newspapers except the guardian and the mirror are pro-government because the tories are happy to protect their interests . 
  step 1 : convince your population that they are ` temporarily embarrassed millionaires ' . 
  this causes them to see themselves as separate from ` the poor ' . 
  they will think `` well i do n't need welfare ! '', 
  step 2 : allow tabloid trash about people living it up on benefits , and programmes like benefits street which just stop short of total demonisation of the poor and needy . 
  step 3 : people now support measures for ` hard working people ' , which include raising inheritance tax threshold ( cos you do n't want to be taxed if you inherit more than # 650,000 - which the vast majority of people do n't ! ), 
  which actually runs against the majority of the population 's interests . 
  step 4 : you 've achieved tory ideology without making people even realise you 're doing it !, 
   is that no politician or banker has ever faced any consequences for their actions . 
  in the uk they 're actually managing to convince people that the pittances we pay out in welfare are what damaged our economy , and so we should cut them off rather than punishing anyone who was actually fiscally reckless rather than someone who once used a part of their # 73 a week in benefits to buy 10 cigarettes . 
  the government will announce a rise in the inheritance tax threshold this week , spinning it as `` rewarding hard working people '' when it 's doing the exact opposite : it 's a tax break for rich people 's children . 
  despite the media 's best efforts , the majority of the british population is pro-eu .
