  [ this poll ] ( http://www.markpack.org.uk/132862/big-swing-to-pro-european-side-in-eu-referendum/ ) with the proposed referendum question puts yes ( staying in ) at 66 % , which i 'm sure is higher than the actual figure , but still is a reflection that british people are , on the whole , pro-eu . 
  many of us are glad that we stayed out of the euro , but a strong and financially secure european union is very much in our interest and most people realise that . 
  even the media is toning down its anti-eu rhetoric now that the referendum 's been announced and they need to toe the party line somewhat . 
  even when cameron admitted that we may not be able to get a revised deal pre-referendum he was n't attacked widely for it . 
  most people are happy with what we have . 
  i would honestly be surprised if more than one or two national newspapers ( the express and maybe the telegraph ) come out for no in 2016/17 . 
  of course , a lot can change in two years , but i personally have found that attitudes here towards europe are getting more reasoned . 
  the fact that lib dem ( internationalist european federalist party ) voters were flocking to ukip show that while a section of the british electorate does have concerns over europe , eurosceptic parties benefit largely as recipients of protest votes . 
  [ even the daily mail ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html ) is really going light on its euroscepticism . 
  to find news about greece you have to scroll past five or six other stories , and there are one or two mildly eurosceptic articles ( which nevertheless stay away from blaming the eu outright ) under a main article which is a fairly neutral one about the capital controls . 
  there is [ this piece of lunacy ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3142954/the-travel-selfies-brussels-wants-ban-jail-posing-pictures-landmarks.html ) but i would n't expect anything else than a misinterpretation of commercial protection law from the dm . 
  the majority of the comments are people calling out the daily mail for misrepresenting things . 
  i 've been somewhat surprised at the british media 's coverage of the greek crisis . 
  they 're usually hugely reactionary and quick to knee-jerk ( and the tabloids still are , using cameron 's ` credit card ' rhetoric and taking the opportunity to stick the knife in the eu - although now that the referendum has been announced , the latter has decreased ) , but a lot of stuff i 've seen in more liberal newspapers and the bbc is an absolution of greece from blame and a recognition that the crisis is not entirely greece 's fault ; that it is somewhat a victim of circumstances . 
  i 've even seen calls for greater financial and fiscal integration in europe to prevent it happening again ( ` no monetary union without fiscal union ' ) from some sources , which is pretty much unprecedented among the populist british media . 
  labour 's scepticism over the eec in the 70s was brought on by their attempts to distance themselves from internationalism , which was seen as a hallmark of communism and marxism . 
  let 's also not forget that the rail electrification plan that the tories sold to the north of england in their election manifesto has been shelved as soon as it became clear that they had a majority . 
  the tories are not the friends of the ` regions ' . 
  when it rains 1 day in 3 here you take what you can get . 
  it 's 18c here in scotland and the queue for the ice cream shop in my town looked like the one in op 's post . 
  i 'll whack it into the [ geordie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geordie ) to english translator : `` here man , we do n't all go on like we 're from [ eastenders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastenders ) , like , you ca n't say that we 're going to use that and sound like [ danny dyer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danny_dyer ) , man , you [ shandy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shandy ) - drinking [ southern ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_england ) fairy .

  while i 'm sure they 're nice places to spend a couple of weeks relaxing , i dislike the fact that so many tourists go there and do n't actually see the country they 've gone to visit outside the walls of the compound , and that the benefits that locals used to reap from tourism are greatly reduced and put in the hands of the holiday companies that own the resorts . 
  [ the uk population still broadly supports capital punishment ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/08/13/capital-punishment-50-years-favoured/ ) . 
  i do n't make judgements about all 63 million people here and all of their political beliefs because they support something abhorrent . 
  * i would prefer that some consideration be given to the british regional accents and that we not adopt the language of famous bbc soap-operas and pound-shop cockney-wide-boy hard-men to represent us .

  it 's also on wiktionary and a few other dictionary sites where it 's marked as obsolete . 
  but that 's not to say it may be listed as a valid translation on a french dictionary site . 
  is it not quite arrogant of you to demand that everything be posted in your preferred language and your language alone ? 
  as long as he is writing something in english i do n't mind whether he writes in french or not , and we ca n't expect all the users of a trans-european subreddit to be writing in perfect , flawless english . 
  i have no trouble understanding what he writes . 
  people are kicking off about the word ` attentat ' , but it is a word that 's used in english to mean a political attack , just a rare and somewhat obsolete one . 
  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attentat / u/dclauzel may have looked it up in a dictionary and not been aware that it was n't used in english any more , we ca n't pillory him for being clumsy in a language that is n't his native one . 
  i like multilingualism on / r/europe , otherwise it 's just / r/worldnews centred on europe and with more pretty pictures . 
  http://www.inbrief.co.uk/offences/offensive-weapon-possessing.htm possessing an offensive weapon in a public place is an offence contrary to section 1 of the prevention of crime act 1953 . 
   in order to satisfy the charge , the prosecution must prove each of the following elements :  has with him ( possession ) ; in any public place ; any offensive weapon  having established all of the above , the charge would succeed , unless the accused proves that he had either : lawful authority ; or reasonable excuse ,, 
  defence of property is never a ground for a defence of self-protection against a charge of murder , across europe . 
  and rightfully so . 
  property can be , and is mostly , insured . 
  human life is n't replaceable . 
  also carrying a weapon in anticipation of self-defence is completely illegal in the uk and i would imagine most european jurisdictions as well . 
   uk prays france will do it this is n't the case - we have border posts on the calais side trying to catch these people . 
  we 're upholding our end of the bargain , it 's the french authorities who are doing nothing about the problem ( cos by and large it is n't affecting them ) . 
  according to the uk retail price index you have n't been able to buy anything meaningful with a penny since the early 20th century . 
  bread went over 1d/loaf in 1914 , milk over 1d/pint in 1916 , potatoes over 1d/lb in 1947 . 
  for all that people like to go on `` oh , you could buy three pints from sixpence and get change in my day '' , beer broke through 1 shilling ( 12 pence ) per pint in 1967 . 
  explanation for those not familiar with pre-1971 uk currency : it used to be the lsd system ( librus/solidus/denarius ) of 1 pound ( # 1 ) = 20 shillings ( 20s ) , 1 shilling ( 1s ) = 12 pence ( 12d ) so 1 pound = 240 pence ( 240d ) . 
  without even talking about guineas , groats , farthings , crowns or florins . 
  i was living in canada when they got rid of their one-cent coin and there were no problems whatsoever . 
  no awkward change to get back at the till , no wallet full of coins you 're never going to use , and debit card transactions and bank balances were n't rounded so the prices were n't going up universally . 
  french is the one language we learn at school because they 're closest to us , so most british people will have a very basic conversational level of french . 
  it also helps that our vocabulary overlaps significantly with theirs . 
  that said , you only study it until you 're 13 , then it 's optional , and it 's very much '' * ou est le bibliotheque * '' kind of education . 
  i did my degree in foreign languages so it 's not really impressive that i can express myself in them . 
  i could give spanish a try , but i only really feel comfortable in those three !, 
  luckily i am one of the brits who speaks a foreign language , we are rare but we do exist .

  the british baby boomers tend to come a bit later , do n't they ? 
  as it took us a lot longer to recover from the war to the point where people were having loads of kids . 
  i thought our baby boom was 1955-1965 . 
  eh , not really . 
  they at least had a good song even if so many of their neighbours were voting for them . 
  this was attested to by many western european countries giving them not insignificant numbers of points . 
  malta , cyprus and ireland all deserted us and even australia failed to live up to its colonial obligations . 
  our most dependable supporters at the moment are actually san marino - they 've given us points six years in a row which is remarkable when you 're talking about british eurovision entries . 
  it was nowhere near as bad as hungary or armenia 's . 
  both of those were out of tune and just poor quality . 
  ours was n't great but i thought it was decently sung at least and an attempt to get away from forgettable ballads . 
  france and hungary 's songs were n't even all that appropriate for eurovision , too political in my book and yet we almost tied with france and hungary beat us by a long way . 
  they 're chucking money into a hole anyway considering the polls are showing a minimum of 70 % support for the amendment , in that way it 's a good thing as they 're not going to shift 20 % of the electorate in five days even if they throw millions at it . 
  most european hostels i 've stayed in are n't organised enough to have a working microwave , never mind a hidden torture chamber . 
  the world 's end is pretty spot on as well , until the supernatural stuff starts happening .

  danny boyle 's first film , shallow grave , is a pretty good look at scotland/edinburgh in the 90s even if it 's a bit murdery . 
  it has that british 90s aesthetic dripping off it . 
  edit : billy elliot is good if you want a look at attitudes towards masculinity in the north east which still prevail nowadays , although they 're less prevalent .
