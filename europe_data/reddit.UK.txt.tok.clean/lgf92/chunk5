  edmund blackadder , 1917, 
  they do have a parliament and an executive like most british overseas territories though , and almost complete control over local affairs . 
  you could argue they 're as devolved and partially-sovereign as wales or northern ireland . 
  lebanon and turkey have millions upon millions of refugees from syria and the eu is n't helping them at all . 
  do n't pretend that every single refugee is dashing towards the eu . 
  i think the big irony is that both british and french stereotypes overlap ; we both think each other is stuck-up , sexually depraved and slightly strange . 
  crabtree is brilliant from a linguistic view point , because he does the exact same thing that distinguishes english people speaking french the most , he gets a large amount of the vowels wrong ( `` i was pissing by the door '' ) , but with his cadence he thinks he 's speaking perfect french . 
  the creators of ` allo ` allo were genius in that regard , as he sounds to english people how english people sound to french people , even if they 're not aware of it . 
  [ a similar one about how british people speak french in an advert for biscuits on french tv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxdlsm04frc ) . 
  it 's not very accurate though , cos british people do n't speak foreign languages . 
  as of last monday a worldwide postcard is # 1 . 
  so you can either go to the post office and get a # 1 stamp , or either two first class ( 63p ) or two second class ( 54p ) stamps will do . 
  the announcement was by the * procureur * ( prosecutor ) in marseille , so i think it 's already been a criminal investigation for a while . 
  it 's at least reassuring that there was nothing mechanically wrong with the plane , but i think there needs to be an enforcement of `` two in the cockpit at all times '' rigorously now . 
  on the contrary , low-cost airlines tend to be safer as their quick turnaround times and four/five flights a day necessitate much more rigorous maintenance and newer aircraft . 
  iirc easyjet and ryanair have never had a fatal accident in their entire history . 
  eh , not really . 
  this is the first non-deliberate fatal accident [ on european soil since 2010 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manx2_flight_7100 ) , the first fatal accident on a flight by [ an airline based in the eu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lufthansa_cargo_flight_8460 ) since 2010 , and the first fatal air crash in france [ since concorde ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_france_flight_4590 ) in 2000 . 
   i 'd like this information so i can scare my friend with it . 
  there are several irrational triggers for this fear in my head : a ) the plane has propellers ( i get the jitters from those little flybe fuckers ) b ) the plane is n't a major airline c ) the plane is more than 10 years old i was really scared of flying from istanbul to bishkek on a turkish low-cost airline until i realised it was a 3-month old , brand spanking new 737 next gen and all of a sudden in my head it became the world 's safest form of transport . 
  brains are weird . 
   i 'm not sure how is the minimum wage is the uk or how are their worker 's protections and how their welfare works , but i know they are already pretty weak next to the rest of europe and it 's about to get a lot worse . 
  and they 've only got weaker since the tories were elected in 2010 !, 
  but at least we * took back control * and parliament can do whatever it likes ... 
  the eu migrant deal with turkey has more or less stopped sea crossings across the mediterranean ( they are hundredths of what they were this time last year ) , proof of what can be done if we work together on issues . 
  they did more than chucking up fences ever did . 
  the geordie accent is an english accent that 's retained a lot of its vowels as the `` old '' english ones and has been influenced by lowlands scots dialects as well as developing its own unique features , which is what makes it sound so different from other english accents : it 's kind of a hybrid of sorts . 
  admittedly not many people speak like the guy in the video , but my grandparents do !, 
  there are even some sentences i have trouble with in his monologue ... 
  as someone who learned skimmed-milk hochdeutsch even vdb 's accent seems heavy to me !, 
  as to hader i get about 1 word in 10 ... now [ try my english accent !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/sda26bl0eea?t=133 ), 
  my german has got so much better since i 've been keeping up with this election ( it was rusty from two years at university a while back ) but i still have so much trouble with the austrian accents in videos like this . 
  on a turnout of 72.7 % ( i do n't know whether that 's high in the context of austrian presidential elections , but it would be a high turnout for a british general election ) , meaning that he has the support of about 34.8 % of the actual electorate . 
  then again we do n't know which way the people who did n't vote would have voted , of course . 
  ukip do it as well in britain , when they underperformed in a by-election in oldham they 'd been tipped to do well in they screamed `` voter fraud by minorities '' at the top of their lungs for 5 days , when they 'd been happy to accept the result when it had them up there with labour . 
  it was later shown that even if every single member of an ethnic minority in the constitutuency had not voted at all , labour would still have won . 
  this was the british reaction for a while , you soon get used to it and just use the contest as an excuse for a piss-up and a party . 
  it was n't the best song , but the emotion in the performance and the use of tatar in the chorus was really interesting . 
  i think it was definitely the ` stand-out ' song even if it was n't the most listenable . 
  i personally preferred bulgaria and russia but i can see why people were moved by ukraine . 
  as graham norton said : `` the uk are on the left hand side of the scoreboard , you might want to take a picture '', 
  cheeto benito, 
  the liberal party ( the lib dems ' predecessors , as the liberals merged with the sdp in 1983 to form the sdp-liberal alliance , which renamed itself the liberal a democrats in 1988 ) was actually one of the big two parties in the uk for about 150 years until it was eclipsed by labour after world war 1 . 
  david lloyd george was our last liberal prime minister during ww1 and he also laid the foundations for the modern welfare state . 
  our parliament is sovereign . 
  that means it can unmake or make any law it likes , as local authorities only make laws ( such as by-laws ) based on the power parliament devolves to them . 
  so our central london government can , subject to the limits of practicality and politics , legislate as it pleases , subject to the * factortame * exception which is that laws which contradict directly applicable eu law incorporated in the uk through the european communities act 1972 can be disapplied by the judiciary . 
  we got rid of our blasphemy laws in 2008 , but i think the last successful prosecution for it had been in 1979 . 
  all i can think of is that there have been some minor orthographical changes , such as writing cooperation instead of co-operation , and the influence of americanisms on how we write words , e.g. 
  medieval winning over mediaeval/medi \u00e6val . 
  i was misremembering - there was [ a court case and some related vandalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pillar_box_war ) on that issue in the fifties . 
  for some reason i 'd got it into my head that it was true . 
  specifically in 1997 there was the `` portillo moment '' where government minister and tory leader aspirant michael portillo lost his seat to stephen twigg on a huge swing . 
  the video is on youtube and it 's great watching if you 're of a labour-supporting persuasion , that night was a bloodbath . 
  scotland also had its own monarchy , government , laws , nobility and so on for hundreds of years . 
  scotland and england still have distinct legal systems , different state churches , different land rights ... and even before devolution first took hold in the 1990s had different processes of government , education , healthcare and local organisation . 
  for example , i 'm trained in english law and i 'm not qualified to give any advice on scottish law as in many areas it 's very different . 
  ~ ~ just as a cheesy example , the queen is known as elizabeth ii in england and elizabeth in scotland , as scotland never had an elizabeth i ( as her rule predated the union ) . ~ ~ lol nvm scotland and england are n't separate sovereign nations , but they 're more different than other posters in this thread are suggesting . 
  they 're more distinct from one another than catalonia and spain largely due to historical factors . 
  it 's kind of a half-truth : you can import them , you just have to [ notify an inspector first ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/1452/made ) . 
  there 's a derogation in article 30 tfeu to the free movement of goods which allows national governments to put limits like this on goods on grounds of protection of humans/plants as long as they 're not a disguised restriction on trade , which i imagine is why this was introduced . 
  numbers 4 and 8 sadly are n't in force any more ( i would have thought the independent would have checked , but there you go ) - they come from s28 town police clauses act 1844 , which was almost entirely repealed by the deregulation act 2015 . 
  plenty !, 
  / u/essexboyz123 has covered a fair few of them , but in studying law i came across tonnes . 
  we used to have an act called the town police clauses act 1847 which made it illegal , among other things , to fly kites , slide on snow , beat doormats , or direct your servants to stand on windowsills to paint the outside of your house in a town , but sadly ( ? ), 
  it was largely repealed in 2015 by the deregulation act . 
  that was our main source of legal hilarity , but there are plenty of weird offences : * `` handling salmon in suspicious circumstances '' contrary to s32 salmon act 1986 * `` violating the king 's companion or eldest daughter '' contrary to s8 treason act 1351 * `` causing bodily harm to any person by wantonly or furiously driving or racing a carriage '' contrary to s35 offences against the person act 1861 * `` assault with the intent to obstruct the sale of grain or its free passage '' contrary to s39 oapa * `` being drunk in licensed premises '' ( i.e. 
  a pub ) contrary to s12 licensing act 1872 * `` moving bees or other things '' in contravention of an order made by the secretary of state under the bees act 1980 we also repealed the death penalty for murder in 1969 , but retained it for arson in a naval dockyard ( until 1971 ) , espionage ( 1981 ) , piracy and high treason ( 1998 ) . 
  under the pre-1832 bloody code we used to have about 150 capital offences , including being found with a blacked face in a forest or being in the company of gypsies for one month . 
  we also have a large number of interesting legal quirks and traditions . 
  when parliament passes an act and it has been sent to the queen for royal assent , it 's then [ read out in the house of lords ] ( https://youtu.be/lhwskfbmhcc?t=377 ) with the statement `` la reyne le veult '' , norman french for ` the queen wills it ' . 
  english has the oxford english dictionary , which is the leading authority on the english language , but it 's purely a descriptive body rather than a prescriptive one - it tracks the language as it changes . 
  there are style and usage guides , but because english has so many international variants , trying to standardise it is pointless . 
  generally how we avoid incompetent or unfit prime ministers is scrutiny , scrutiny , scrutiny which stops them being able to do much at all really . 
  look at how [ john major ] ( https://youtu.be/azumeghmcy8?t=201 ) or [ gordon brown ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ipaiyluyw0 ) handled prime minister 's questions . 
  can you imagine donald trump having to stand up once a week in front of the house of representatives and answer aggressive questions from opposition members in [ this atmosphere ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wihoufxf9qq ) ? 
  we also have the civil service which , due to its natural staidness and conservatism , acts as a fetter on over-ideological ministers and prime ministers , as best shown in [ yes , prime minister ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyjh3qkjsmk ) . 
  so even if they get in , we tend to be able to stop them rabble-rousing too much . 
  for the uk it will be a case of checking on individual university websites . 
  as you only have the high school diploma , you will necessarily be limited in the universities you choose , as the higher ones will want ap classes and usually an sat as well . 
  [ these are uk universities ranked by their aptitude in politics courses ] ( http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?s=politics ) . 
  sadly it does n't look too good - i looked at some of the lower ones and they still have requirements which are more than you have . 
  almost all of them want some ap classes and an act/sat score above a certain level . 
  for example , [ london south bank university ] ( http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/international/your-country/united-states-of-america ) which has an entry grade of bcc at a-level ( about as low as you can go while still passing ) still requires ap and sat/act . 
  so it might be a case of going and doing those if you want to study here , or looking into ` foundation year ' programmes which would get you up to the level needed to start a degree , some universities offer those for international students . 
  i 'm not certain duolingo will get you up to the level needed to follow and participate in a degree-level course in political science though . 
  i studied french for five years at school and i still had a lot of difficulty in classes taught in french during my degree . 
  at work : either `` hello , [ my name ] speaking '' or simply '' [ my name ] '' if it 's an internal call . 
  not at work : `` hello ? '', 
  if i do n't know the caller , something like ` you alright ' if it 's one of my friends . 
  we actually have a [ specific section of our sexual offences act ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/part/1/crossheading/abuse-of-position-of-trust ) for this kind of thing , it 's taken very seriously . 
  it is the end of your career as a teacher if you 're caught doing anything like that . 
  there was a student and teacher who ran away to france a couple of years ago and the teacher got a shellacking in the press , on top of his five-and-a-half-year prison sentence . 
  here 's [ the daily mail calling him a paedophile ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3155828/paedophile-teacher-jeremy-forrest-dumps-teenage-girl-ran-away-france-set-released-prison-today.html ) , here 's the [ mirror calling him a paedophile ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/runaway-schoolgirl-who-fled-paedophile-5961481 ) , it definitely is n't something light-hearted and fun . 
  when i was at uni there were always rumours of certain lecturers who `` did the rounds '' if you will , but that 's a lot more acceptable at that level because you can separate the lecturer-student relationship and the personal relationship . 
   i just pretend being sick . 
  everyone in nice thought i was ill already with my pasty milk-bottle complexion , so this would n't have been helping my image , hahah . 
  luckily here in the north of england the standard greeting is a nod of the head and perhaps a mumbled `` you alright ? 
  '' , nothing as complicated as la bise .
