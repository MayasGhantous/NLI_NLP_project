  this was my life as a reserved englishman living in the south of france for a few months . 
  i never got the hang of it and i used to just offer people my hand instead !, 
  this is why english people hate showing affection , it 's more complicated than being cold , reserved and hateful . 
  england 's only real minority language is cornish ( we only have dialects beyond that ) and as i understand it , cornish is more or less dead . 
  there are revival efforts ongoing but nothing on the level of scottish gaelic/welsh/irish which all managed to stay alive or manx which was only extinct for a short period . 
  i believe the last proper native cornish speakers died 300 or so years ago and there is n't the same level of funding for things like cornish language education that there is for the others . 
  most people who learn it are hobbyists . 
  the one for england and wales was slightly different : * what is your ethnic group ? 
  * a - white : ( ** 87.17 % ** ) - english , welsh , scottish , northern irish , british - irish - gypsy or irish traveller - other ( write in  b - mixed/multiple ethnic groups : ( ** 1.98 % ** ) - white and black caribbean - white and black african - white and asian - any other ( write in ) : c - asian/asian british ( ** 6.92 % ** ) - indian - pakistani - bangladeshi - chinese - any other ( write in ) : d - black/african/caribbean / black british ( ** 3.01 % ** ) - african - caribbean - any other ( write in ) : e - other ethnic group ( ** 0.92 % ** ) - arab - any other ( write in ) :, 
  cities can even have them . 
  in newcastle `` blaydon races '' is often considered the geordie anthem . 
  there 's also the [ rockall dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rockall_bank_dispute ) concerning who owns rockall bank in the atlantic ( and consequently has a much bigger eez ) between us , iceland , denmark and formerly ireland . 
  gstq is a ) a dirge and b ) over in literally 20 seconds . 
  i have no idea why we do n't use jerusalem for english teams , it 's much more rousing and you get a bit more value for money . 
  we do have a couple of extreme-traditionalist christian sects , but they 're a ) tiny and b ) very shut off from society . 
  groups like the [ plymouth brethren ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plymouth_brethren ) , and especially the [ `` exclusive brethren '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plymouth_brethren_christian_church ) have similar features to the amish : a ban on connection with the outside world which means no tv , radio or internet , and they only socialise with people who they go to services with . 
  their children only marry other sect members , they run their own schools and so on . 
  they 're very rarely talked about , i only learned about them after reading about the `` acid bath murderer '' [ john haigh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_george_haigh ) who grew up amongst them and said his religious nightmares and mania brought on by a childhood there pushed him towards murder . 
  i remember he specifically said that he had nightmares about being ` marked with a blue pencil by satan ' , which his father warned him would happen if he ever sinned . 
   however , democratically elected officials have only been a thing here for several decades you 're still ahead of sark which was feudal until 2008 . 
  i looked it up - and they 're utterly insignificant . 
  they have 766 members ( the uk 's population being around 65 million ) according to their last return to the electoral commission , and they stood several candidates in the 2015 election but failed to get more than 1 % in any constituency . 
  they do have two parish councillors ( our lowest level of representation - basically the council for a village or area of a town ) who were elected as independents but defected to them . 
  our electoral system does n't favour small parties - even people like the greens have trouble getting elected and they 're a hundred times bigger than the pirates . 
  we do n't have a t-v distinction any more , so we make do with modifying our tone , word choice , intonation and body language to convey formality . 
  there are also some titles we use - for example children at school up to 16 refer to teachers as sir/miss . 
  leicester does crisps as well !, 
  ( admittedly that 's more recent ), 
  london - finance , banking , law , formerly a port sheffield - steel newcastle - coal mining , shipbuilding ( so much coal went though newcastle that there used to be a saying meaning ` to do something useless ' - ` to bring coals to newcastle ' ) leeds - textiles , cloth liverpool - formerly a major port ( we fitted out the confederate fleet there during the us civil war ! ), 
  bristol , portsmouth - ports , shipbuilding ( hence the saying `` ship-shape and bristol fashion '' ) stoke - ceramics birmingham - more or less anything industrial , jewellery manchester - cotton , left-wing politics , port south wales - coal mining glasgow - shipbuilding ( especially warships ) however , most of these industries declined in the 2nd half of the 20th century to the point that they 're not really associated any more . 
  for example , we no longer have any traditional non-open face coal mines . 
  cities are starting to get new reputations , such as newcastle now reputedly full of call centres . 
  we used to have the independent which , while it had a slight left-progressive bias ( due to its readership and editorial staff ) was genuinely the most impartial paper i 've ever read . 
  but sadly it did n't sell , so instead we have murdoch 's tits-and-holidays-with-a-bit-of-right-wing-politics rags and a series of syncophatic hysterial right-wing tabloids . 
  i suppose something like the financial times is as close as you 'll come to being unbiased , even if it does let its free-market liberal ideology show every now and again . 
  i think hamon is out of it to be honest , i 'd say i 'm 75 % sure it will be either fillon or le pen . 
  the 25 % is if macron can rally enough to get into second place . 
  i just do n't see how melenchon is going to take enough voters away from fillon/le pen to come second . 
  if valls wins he 'll only draw votes away from macron , letting melenchon finish third . 
  [ an album of jessie ] ( http://imgur.com/a/qetas ) , the world 's most offended-looking cat . 
  do n't worry , it feels good to rant about shit like this . 
  like in the robin hood film , where they travel from nottingham to london via hadrian 's wall , which in medieval times would have been a several-day-long detour and also involve going into border territory that was more or less no man 's land . 
  i was going to say `` around 0.8 '' . 
  you just have to look at what mill was writing in the mid-1850s :  society can and does execute its own mandates : and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right , or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle , it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression . 
  tbf his english is better than 95 % of british politicians ' ability to speak a foreign language , i 'm always slow to criticise a non-native speaker 's ability . 
  he 's comprehensible , he just sounds very german . 
  a list of british political embarrassments : * the [ rumble in rhyl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uhme8dcoqc ) where deputy prime minister john prescott punched a protestor who threw an egg at him ; * [ gordon brown 's slip of the tongue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ipaiyluyw0 ) in parliament in the middle of the financial crisis ; * when an mp , ron davies , was caught cruising for gay sex in a motorway lay-by , and [ tried to say he was actually out ` watching badgers ' ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/mar/10/uk.wales ) * the entirety of john major 's `` back to basics '' campaign , which focussed on `` traditional values '' but was somewhat undermined by a huge list of tory mps being involved in various sexual and financial scandals over the next few years ; * gordon brown 's [ `` bigoted woman '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfl_evwml2m ) comment which some people suggest stopped labour having any chance of getting back into government through a lib-lab coalition * [ boris johnson 's zipline moment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hrwnxmdrco ) ; * [ liz truss ' outstanding oratory skills at the tory conference ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_wko4hk07o ) , [ part 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brhlrm6ryck ) ; * [ neil kinnock 's `` we 're alright !! '', 
  speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7togb3smvro ) which is often said to have turned people against labour at the last minute in the 1992 election, 
   their culture is our enemy i keep trying to reassure myself that europe is n't in a similar kind of crisis it was in in the late 1920s and then i fucking read things like this . 
  there 's actually a bit of the monaco conurbation called beausoleil which is part of france . 
  my bank account was in france , not monaco , so i used to have to walk there if i needed to go to the bank on a work day . 
  it was weird having to cross a border and being able to do so in 15 minutes walk . 
  in england and wales we have a very informal procedure called a `` deed poll '' . 
  it involves signing a document in the presence of two witnesses in the format :  `` i , [ old name ] , of [ your address ] , have given up my name , [ old name ] , and have adopted for all purposes the name [ new name ] . 
   signed as a deed on [ date ] as [ old name ] and [ new name ] in the presence of [ witness 1 name ] of [ witness 1 address ] , and [ witness 2 name ] of [ witness 2 address ] . 
   [ your new signature ] , [ your old signature ]  [ witnesses ' signatures ] you then send the government this document and it 's put on the `` official register '' which lets you apply to government agencies and so on to have the name on your passport , driving licence and so on changed , which then lets you use those documents to change other things like your bills and your electoral registration . 
  how enforceable that document is in the rest of europe though , i have no idea . 
  i was being paid $ 385 a month ( the french statutory minimum for internships ) and i could still ( barely ) afford to live down there . 
  it was n't a huge amount of fun on that much money but at least the weather was nice . 
  i suppose you 're right , but realising the money in the house would of course then mean that you do n't live in monaco . 
  i believe that the monaco government also has some state housing which it gives to its citizens as well , so those people do n't even have the benefit of a huge asset . 
  nor here , the church of england is one of the most progressive mainstream churches in the world . 
  our conservative mps like to talk about their christian beliefs but vey very few of them hold us-style christian conservative/theocratic beliefs . 
  i worked in monaco for a few months a couple of years ago . 
  there are people who live in monaco cos their family have lived there for generations , and who are monegasque citizens ( my boss was one of them , and her grandfather had been a baker whose business was still going under the control of his son ) - i think i remember reading there are about ten thousand of them . 
  obviously they live in a very rich environment , but many of them only live there by virtue of their families having bought property in monaco when it was still something of a backwater . 
  while there 's obviously the superyachts and the penthouses and the ridiculous rent ( i paid $ 400 a month for a room in nice and commuted in ; the cheapest room i could find in monaco was upwards of $ 1800 a month ) , monaco does actually have all the things you 'd expect in a city of its size . 
  i worked near the stade louis ii and there 's a really big carrefour that 's just full of people doing shopping and office workers buying lunch . 
  down the road there 's a mcdonalds in the midst of really expensive restaurants ( i mean , there 's a sandwich shop next to carrefour that only does foie gras ) and the prince 's car collection museum . 
  so as long as you have property , you do n't have to have tonnes of money , not least because nice is only 30 minutes away . 
  it 's a really odd , interesting place to be and quite unique . 
  charles i gave it a good go , even king john did n't manage to result in the entire monarchy being removed for a little while . 
  just try an take these farms off me m8 not gon na happen just u w8 till me m8 blucher gets here, 
  from the mid 1800s to the mid 1960s anyone from our colonies could move to the uk with very little trouble . 
  there used to be entire towns with black communities from the colonies in wales 100 years ago , and inner london was less white british than it is today - areas like whitechapel were upwards of 85 % european jewish . 
  there has never been a period in the last 2000 years where european countries have n't had substantial amounts of migration from outside of europe despite what you may believe . 
  and guess what - my parents remember the same prejudices against black people and indians , and my grandparents remember the same prejudices against irish people and jews , that we see against middle easterners now . 
  the cycle repeats itself . 
  and interestingly it is an oath to the queen and her heirs and successors , not to the country or the government . 
  ukip are nominally libertarian , although i 'm yet to see any policies that suggest that they 're actually libertarians . 
  they 've made noises about nhs privatisation and like to pretend that all their members want to leave the eu for the great trade opportunities with the rest of the world though . 
  equally , though , we 've had elections where the party with the 2nd highest number of votes has ended up governing - 1951 . 
  we 've had elections where people with radical views ended up getting elected - 1979 . 
  we 've had elections where there have been allegations of state interference swinging the vote at the last minute - 1924 . 
  the us did n't refuse to recognise churchill , thatcher and baldwin respectively , nor did we do a recount . 
  the system is broken but that does n't mean democracy is . 
  the day that the uk imposes sanctions on the usa , we will have bigger concerns than the fact of the sanctions , because something will have gone horribly fucking wrong . 
  trump is a liability and i 'm sure the british government would have preferred to deal with anyone else , but he 's still the leader of a major ally and we have to treat him like that . 
  however , i am not opposed to our government standing up to him or his acolytes ' idiotic remarks on things like islam , climate change , european politics and so on . 
  for someone who claims to love sovereignty he sure does like telling other countries what to do ( like suggesting nigel farage should be ambassador , which was just completely out of line ) . 
  the gesture is often referred to as `` sticking two fingers up to someone '' . 
  in my experience it tastes a lot sweeter and lighter in ireland than it does in the uk . 
  i certainly preferred it over there , and they explained to me that it 's because they use a certain type of water to make it and it does n't keep too well in transport . 
  my university halls used to have a buffet in the morning at the canteen and you just helped yourself as the price of the halls included food . 
  so for one , glorious , cholesterol filled year , you could have a fried breakfast every morning , but i would n't recommend it for your health . 
  maybe if you 're doing a lot of manual labour and will burn off the calories . 
  do you like paying over the odds ( a season ticket between my home town and the nearest city , about 7 miles , is ~ # 3000 a year ) to travel on an unheated coach that rattles and shakes because it was designed on the cheap based off a [ 70s bus chassis ] ( http://www.metropolitanrailway.co.uk/rb3.jpg ) ? 
  then northern rail is for you !, 
  that 's all you need to know about the front national and why they 're not some amazing grassroots populist force . 
   bunch of idiots who do n't know/accept that democracy means that sometimes things do n't go your way .
