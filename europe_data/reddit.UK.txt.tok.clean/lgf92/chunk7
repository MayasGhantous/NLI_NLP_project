  democracy does n't mean tyranny of the majority . 
  if people disagree with a democratic decision , they have their right to protest to try and influence people 's thinking on that decision . 
  eurosceptics spent 40 years after our referendum on entering the eu whining endlessly about how we should leave , they did n't sit down and accept it . 
  people who feel that we are better off in the eu should be making that case , and it 's not anti-democratic for them to do so . 
  perhaps if the government listened to them immediately , that would be anti-democratic . 
  but the fact is that it 's not undemocratic to protest a decision a ) that you think was wrong , and b ) that would be overturned by 2 % of the population changing its mind , otherwise you 're just drawing lines in the sand around yourself and refusing to step over them . 
  i mean it 's not like anti-trump protestors / pro-remain protestors are launching armed coups to overthrow the government , they 're just making their voices heard and trying to influence the situation even though they were on the `` losing '' side . 
  you can guarantee the other side in both situations would have done the exact same - democracy does n't mean shutting out the half of the population that was on the other side and settling the argument once and for all . 
  look at gina miller , who led the campaign for parliament to have a vote on article 50 - she was fighting for one of our key constitutional values to be upheld , not `` advocating for authoritarian rule '' . 
  quite the opposite in fact . 
  the second that the uk monarchy intervenes in politics we do n't have a monarchy any more . 
  that was made clear during the english civil war and is the reason why our monarchs have n't intervened in legislative politics since the early 1700s . 
  and long may it prevail , the monarchy serves the people and not the other way around . 
  this is why i never got the people who are desperate for a rapprochement with russia , we do it on our terms or not at all . 
  this is because russia has shown time and again that if you give them an inch on their terms they soon take a mile and set up a frozen conflict puppet state within that mile . 
  is this really such an odd thing ? 
  my go-to lunch when i worked in france was a sandwich or a salad with a small pack of nuts or crisps , and they used to find it weird there as well . 
  ( i 'm speaking in terms of england and wales - we have three separate legal jurisdictions in the uk , as scotland and northern ireland have their own distinct legal systems ) . 
  historically the uk was quite a litigious country - many of our key contract law cases arise from small-scale disputes that nowadays would never get litigated . 
  in the late 1990s the civil courts were overhauled in the woolf reforms , followed by the jackson reforms a few years ago . 
  they were given one objective : `` to deal with cases justly , and at proportionate cost '' . 
  the effect of this has been to give the courts much wider powers to order alternatives to litigation such as settlement and mediation , including the power to impose costs consequences for unreasonable conduct such as refusing to settle ( and subsequently winning less at trial ) or failing to comply with certain protocols before you start legal proceedings . 
  more often than not , the parties have to agree costs budgets which set an upper limit of what they can recover at the end of a case . 
  this means that the volume of litigation has dropped . 
  the type of cases that are about the sale of a cigarette machine ( * l'estrange v graucob * ) or a parking ticket ( * thornton v shoe lane parking * ) or an underwhelming holiday ( * jarvis v swan tours * ) you do n't see too often in the courts any more , which are more reserved for complicated commercial litigation . 
  that said , we do have a small claims procedure which is often used for simple debt recovery and consumer claims , and is designed to be as user-friendly and as open as possible . 
  it depends what you 're voting on . 
  usually you will get a paper for each election you 're voting in , e.g. 
  council election , general election , european parliament election , with a [ list of candidates in your council ward/constituency/european constituency ] ( http://lh5.ggpht.com/_s3glzw4hswu/s90y-4vxxzi/aaaaaaaaamu/lvka1njfpne/s1600/mp-01949.jpg ) . 
  that one is a list of general election candidates for the 2015 election in lewisham deptford constituency in south-east london . 
  in the recent referendum , the ballot looked like [ this ] ( http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/secondary/448598.jpg ) as there were only two choices . 
  you walk into the polling station , give your name and postcode , take the paper over to a stand , mark your choice and put it in the box , pretty standard . 
  you can see from the ballot paper our three historically major parties : labour , the conservatives , the liberal democrats ( formerly the liberal party or the sdp ) , along with some smaller parties , including the greens . 
  notably absent are parties like ukip and regional parties like the snp , probably because it 's a ballot paper from a diverse area of london . 
  a quick wikipedia search will tell you about these parties better than i can . 
  my favourite bit of archaic legislation that is still technically in force is the [ town police clauses act 1847 ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/vict/10-11/89 ) which forbids , among other things : * driving or riding furiously any horse or carriage * placing any furniture or benches or advertising on the street * carrying any `` cask , tub , hoop , or wheel , or any ladder , plank , pole , timber , or log of wood '' on the street otherwise than to load it or unload it or to cross the road * singing profane or obscene songs or ballads * knocking on a door or ringing a bell so as to `` wilfully and wantonly disturb any inhabitant '' * flying a kite or making a slide on ice or snow * beating a carpet or rug ( with certain exceptions for door mats before 8am ) * suffering `` common prostitutes or reputed thieves '' within your coffeehouse of course it 's not enforced ( not least because section 1 says it only applies to acts of parliament which incorporate it ) , but it is quite funny . 
  it 's also the basis for a lot of our laws on taxis and private hire vehicles aside from all the weird stuff about what you ca n't do in the street , so it does serve a purpose . 
  there are also a couple of other odd victorian offences that we still have hanging around , such as [ assault with intent to obstruct the sale of grain or its free passage ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/vict/24-25/100/section/39 ) or [ obstructing or assaulting a clergyman or other minister in the discharge of his duties ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/vict/24-25/100/section/36 ) . 
  a serious answer perhaps : some of our treason laws are outdated ( as they come from the 1300s ) ; for example , sleeping with the sovereign 's wife is treason ( and so punishable by life imprisonment ) . 
  people have different views on the drug legislation we have here and especially the psychoactive substances act introduced this year which criminalises a very wide range of substances . 
  we 've got rid of most of the silly stuff ( residual death penalty laws , blasphemous libel , etc. ), 
  but there 's still a bit hanging around . 
  i suppose it would be nice ( on a wider topic of law reform ) to have a codified constitution rather than the mess we have now . 
  i agree with op 's advice but he missed the best sam smith 's in london - ye olde cheshire cheese on fleet street , it was rebuilt in 1667 after the great fire and used to be a hangout of charles dickens and samuel johnson . 
  you also get a great view of st paul 's and the gherkin from out the front . 
  you can plug the numbers into a [ take-home pay calculator ] ( http://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/salary.php ) for the uk and add all sorts of stuff like salary sacrifice , pension contributions , benefits in kind , student loan repayments , etc. 
  if you put in $ 100,000 ( ~ # 81,752 ) you 'll see that your pay looks something like :  gross income : # 81,752  tax : # 21,900.80  national insurance : # 4,967.84  take-home pay : # 54,833.36 on this amount , that gives you a total tax rate around 33.9 % on that amount of income , 26.8 % income tax overall and 6.0 % ni contributions ( the numbers do n't add up due to rounding ) . 
  in reality you would also likely be paying pension contributions which would raise the percentage - although they 're deducted on your gross income and so reduce your taxable income . 
  from experience this can be up to 15-20 % of your total income which means you pay a lot less tax . 
  london has bits and pieces of its medieval heritage , a lot of it was destroyed in the fire of 1666 and then in the blitz . 
  there is still some of the [ roman wall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_wall ) and some medieval artifacts like the [ tower of london ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tower_of_london ) but other than that not much else . 
  medieval cities in the uk include [ york ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/the_shambles%2c_york.jpg ) ( [ bonus ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/micklegate_bar_%283%29.jpg ) ) , [ lincoln ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/high_bridge%2c_high_street%2c_lincoln.jpg ) ( [ bonus ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/farmer%27s_market_-_geograph.org.uk_-_556376.jpg ) ) , [ durham ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/durham_millburngate_bridge.jpg ) ( [ bonus ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/durham_market_place.jpg ) ) , [ edinburgh ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/edinburgh_old_town_skyline.jpg ) ( parts of its old town ) and places like oxford , cambridge , winchester , canterbury , chester , lancaster ... we have a fair few of them !, 
  almost perfect : '' ... to * children * ardent for some desperate glory ... '' it 's burnt into my skull not only from school but from re-reading * all quiet on the western front * this week and looking it up again . 
  same here actually , but the only bit i can actually remember is the line from `` you would not tell with such high zest ... '', 
  here are some video examples : the traditional [ cockney accent ] ( https://youtu.be/z1v_s-ggnsm?t=111 ) ( from 1:51 ) and [ multicultural london english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhwwpoi8eqy ) which emerged in south london in the 1990s and is either replacing or displacing cockney accents . 
  walking around london today i heard both - cockney on older people , mle on younger people . 
  i was going to point that out but it 's not worth arguing with people like this , it just gives them the attention they 're desperate for . 
  you show your ignorance when you think there 's one `` indian '' or `` nigerian '' people . 
  the thing is , we do n't know yet ( as these people generally wo n't be retiring for 30-40 years ) . 
  the most pressing problem is the pressure that will be placed on public revenue by the disproportionately large segment of the population which were born after the war who retire in the next 10-15 years . 
  if we can cope with that , we can cope with the next tranche of people who will retire after that as there will be less of them as a proportion of the population . 
  our government already spends nearly 30 % of its income on pensions , way more than healthcare or welfare . 
  edit : lol just realised i 'm arguing with a neonazi never mind, 
  i do n't have the figures to hand ( you can probably find them with a google search ) but at least among eu immigrants , more of them are degree educated and working in skilled professions than native brits . 
  if i remember correctly they along with non-eu migrants are both net contributors to public revenue as they tend to be working age and we do n't have to educate them . 
  look up the obr 's report on immigration levels needed to maintain debt to gdp ratios . 
  the baseline is somewhere around 200,000 each year for debt to remain at a sustainable level . 
  this is because older people , as they become a larger portion of the population , take out more than they have contributed in state pension and healthcare costs , hence a deficit . 
  immigration provides a steady flow of working age people who , like most working age people , are usually net contributors to the tax system . 
  negative effects of a rising population on infrastructure is more to do with systematically low government investment budgeting to zero - the system should be able to cope with a year on year increase around birth rates plus 1 % . 
  not quite - it 's more like `` your rights only go as far as infringing on someone else 's rights '' . 
  like someone insisting that they have a right to swing their fist , which they do - up until the point that they hit someone . 
  equally , you have the right to sleep with anyone you choose , unless they ca n't or do n't consent . 
  it turns out it 's actually a quote by an [ american judicial philosopher ] ( https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/zechariah_chafee ) . 
  this is the principle of `` i have the right to swing my fist up until i hit your face '' . 
  i think the state has absolutely no right interfering in the bedroom affairs of * consenting adults * , which is why i use that wording . 
  it is my business if people are being molested against their will or when they 're too young to consent . 
  ok , here we go : - the british empire was , generally speaking , not a force for good for the people who lived in the colonies - a lot of european criticism of british cuisine is well-founded , although we have made huge improvements in the last 20 years which europe often fails to recognise - it 's a shame that a lot of the stuff tony blair did is forgotten because of his regrettable decision to intervene in iraq - britain can not under any reasonable circumstances survive outside of the single market without a large amount of economic damage - the main reason why we need immigration in this country is to boost tax receipts and if we limit it too much we risk a massive public spending crisis in 20-30 years ' time, 
  i really liked chicago-style pizza when i was there ( maybe not as much as normal pizza , but as a novelty ) , but as a brit i 'm more or less excluded from having a culinary opinion by the continental europeans . 
  or [ this ] ( http://smashinglife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/horse-guard-passes-out.jpg ) , or [ this one from d-day ] ( http://witnify.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/operation_overlord_the_normandy_landings-_d-day_6_june_1944_b5207.jpg ) . 
  we just love #bantz . 
  i 'm not op , but i am english . 
  i grew up in the north of england , so the vast majority of people i knew had been to scotland . 
  it 's quite common for people to go for a day out or a weekend to edinburgh for shopping or whatever , especially at christmas . 
  by contrast , almost no-one i knew had ever been to wales or northern ireland . 
  it really is a proximity thing , because now i live in london and most people seem to have been to wales . 
  in terms of [ english counties ] ( http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/jo/maps/uktowns.gif ) , i think i am missing most of the ones in the midlands and the south west but i 've done most of the east coast . 
  the vast majority of our overseas territories are far-flung ( the british virgin islands , ascension , the falklands etc. ) . 
  we do have the isle of man and the channel islands nearby and sometimes people go there . 
  the memories are especially painful in south yorkshire due to things like the [ `` battle of orgreave '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrmdld089m ) during the miners ' strike in 1984-85 , when the police basically charged picket lines on horse back with truncheons in a display of brutality . 
  this was also a time when her government froze the national union of mineworkers ' bank accounts that they had saved to feed striking miners on trumped-up charges so it got to the point that the soviet government was sending food to miners which their own government would n't give them . 
  the guardian is arguably the most left wing paper in that it at least runs pro corbyn articles ( eg owen jones until the scales fell off his eyes ) and gave a voice to bolshie lexiters when the mirror would n't for fear of alienating its more working class labour voting audience . 
  it 's certainly less populist . 
  it 's a `` new labour '' paper so a description as broadly centrist is fair . 
  haha i 'm definitely in the latter category when it comes to thatcher , but i tried to be fair and gave the academic point of view !, 
  she certainly got a lot done ... 
  the big 4 from the 20th century often suggested to be the best by academics are : * david lloyd george ( 1916-22 ) - leader during the first world war , pioneered redistribution efforts like the people 's budget as chancellor and then more or less created the foundations for the welfare state through national insurance and state pensions towards the end of his term . 
  also led britain 's negotiations at the post-war conferences and gave the vote to women . 
  * winston churchill ( 1940-45 ; 1951-55 ) - wartime leader , inspirational figure , more or less enough said . 
  he took over from a weak government and formed a national coalition to lead the uk through the war .
