  his second term was less of a success and so it gets talked about less . 
  * clement attlee ( 1945-51 ) - put in place massive social reforms after the war including nationalisation of important industries , huge labour reforms and his government created our national health service which continues to this day . 
  his government effectively laid the foundation for the british state for the next 30 years , until ... * margaret thatcher ( 1979-90 ) - hugely controversial and divisive , but supervised a huge economic liberalisation of the uk through the 80s and arguably laid the foundation for sectors of the economy such as financial services being so important . 
  also known as the prime minister who led the country through the falklands war , but her reign ended with her party ousting her in favour of john major in 1990 as it tore itself to bits over europe . 
  there are honourable mentions for older prime ministers such as william pitt the younger ( led britain through the early stages of the napoleonic wars , worked towards peace in ireland , and reformed the state ) , robert peel ( supervised and laid the foundations for the industrial revolution and more or less created modern criminal law ) , earl grey ( expanded suffrage beyond the nobility for the first time and outlawed slavery ) , william gladstone ( presided over the country for more or less 30 years at the end of the 19th century - the height of the empire - with major political and economic reforms ) . 
  today 's papers , in descending order of circulation : [ the sun ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/1b2c/production/_91965960_the-sun-front-page-18.10.16.jpg ) - populist , generally right-wing tabloid , known for sleazy journalism , eye-catching headlines and boobs everywhere . 
  still the most popular newspaper in the country despite its reputation . 
  [ daily mail ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/1706c/production/_91961349_mail.jpg ) - right-wing paper that has quite a storied history ( it supported oswald mosley 's fascist blackshirts in the 30s ) . 
  generally known as one of the voices of little england and old-fashioned conservatism along with a dose of moral hysteria . 
  [ metro ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/14c4/production/_91961350_metro.jpg ) - free newspaper given out at railway stations , on buses etc. 
  in the morning . 
  it does n't tend to have much of a political bias and is ` easy reading ' with short articles and lots of showbiz/culture news . 
  i find it quite dull . 
  [ evening standard ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cvdmu3lwyaaeg7j.jpg:large ) - free newspaper given out in the london area in the evening . 
  it tends to have a pro-establishment/pro-tory/pro-business bias but not too openly . 
  [ daily mirror ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/3bd4/production/_91961351_mirror.jpg ) - populist left-wing tabloid . 
  tends to spend a lot of time bashing bankers/politicians mixed in with a lot of showbiz , like the sun of the left . 
  [ daily telegraph ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/ad1c/production/_91961344_telegraph1.jpg ) - quite a sober , right-wing newspaper ( its nickname is the torygraph ) which is very conservative and represents a slightly more well-off reader than the mail or express , although along with those two it spent 40 years making up shit about the eu and whining constantly about it . 
  [ daily star ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/10adc/production/_91961386_starcopy.jpg ) - boobs , football , tv soaps , sometimes a bit of outraged populist politics in there . 
  [ daily express ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/e3cc/production/_91961385_expresscopy.jpg ) - for people who think the daily mail is a bit too calm , basically the same parochial `` little england '' audience but even more hysterical . 
  has an obsession with princess diana for some reason . 
  [ the times ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/62e4/production/_91961352_times.jpg ) - the oldest newspaper in the country , and in my opinion probably the best-written outside of the ft. 
  it is perhaps the most centrist of the right-wing papers and is quite moderate . 
  [ financial times ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/1625c/production/_91961709_ft2.jpg ) - politically neutral newspaper focussing on finance and deep articles , personally my favourite . 
  it tends to have a `` pro-business '' slant but does n't often show it in the articles . 
  [ the guardian ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/1224c/production/_91961347_guardian.jpg ) - the other major left wing paper along with the mirror , but more urbane and metropolitan . 
  `` guardian reader '' is often shorthand for the ` liberal elite ' kind of snobby person people imagine to live in the london suburbs . 
   laws against hate speech is undemocratic our only laws against hate speech are where it 's done to incite hatred or to inspire violence . 
  is protecting people from speech like that `` undemocratic '' when it 's done with the consent of parliament and with the support of most of the electorate ? 
   yes you do have no go zones just not as many as other countries do tell me more about my own country !, 
  * eagerly awaits breitbart link about that ginger convert guy who went around putting up sharia zone stickers 10 years ago in east london *, 
  it 's worth pointing out as well that the situation has got better . 
  around the time of the riots in places like toxteth and broadwater farm in the 1980s and 1990s lots of the resentment was stirred up by the fact that if police did go to these places they were heavy-handed verging on abusive , and that was even when they were protecting firefighters or paramedics . 
  look at what happened to [ pc keith blakelock ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_keith_blakelock ) in 1985 . 
  the met even had a euphemism for these kinds of places - [ `` symbolic locations '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symbolic_location ) . 
  luckily a lot of regeneration and focus on `` community policing '' seems to have made things a little bit better . 
  ed balls is a [ national treasure ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4x2wc9pfpq ) . 
  this man was nearly our chancellor . 
  what the fuck are you on about lol, 
  hahaha this is an exceptional mix of patronising swinging at shadows . 
  i laugh because if people are stupid enough to support an ideology that necessarily entails their genocide it 's just absurd . 
  just as i laugh at the absurd hypocrisy of islamist extremists like anjem chaudhury , or when hyper-religious priests in america get caught doing drugs with their boyfriend . 
  i do n't know what the british empire ( of which i 'm no supporter ) has to do with any of this . 
  most of the people who support the empire would have done alright under it , unlike eastern european neo nazis . 
  this is why i laugh at polish and russian neo-nazis . 
  their entire argument can be disproven with a google search for `` generalplan ost '' , unless they really think that they personally are worthy of genocide . 
  turing contributed a lot , but brunel basically led the industrial revolution , stephenson invented the railway , whittle the modern jet engine and berners-lee the world wide web . 
  it 's hard to say turing had the same impact on day-to-day life as those four . 
  he would have been my 5th choice for sure nevertheless . 
  i had tonnes of dilemmas like this putting this list together , we have produced a lot of talent for a small island nation . 
  a choice of hobbes , keynes and mill is perhaps my subconscious left-liberal bias showing , but you could have had thomas paine , thomas more , jeremy bentham ... 
  i also chose jenner over people like humphry davy , charles babbage , francis crick , edmund halley , robert hooke ... 
  i suppose i 'd give an honourable mention to people like earl grey or henry v or clement attlee who do n't really fit into any of these categories . 
  [ boudica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boudica ) for the celts/britons, 
  i 've limited myself to four from each category and done `` england only '' ( as otherwise i 'd feel wrong leaving out scottish , welsh , northern irish people ) : poets : [ chaucer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geoffrey_chaucer ) , [ keats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_keats ) , [ byron ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord_byron ) , [ shelley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/percy_bysshe_shelley ) authors : [ shakespeare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shakespeare ) , [ dickens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_dickens ) , [ austen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jane_austen ) , [ orwell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_orwell ) scientists : [ newton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isaac_newton ) , [ faraday ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_faraday ) , [ darwin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_darwin ) , [ jenner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edward_jenner ) engineers : [ brunel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isambard_kingdom_brunel ) , [ stephenson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_stephenson ) , [ whittle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frank_whittle ) , [ berners-lee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tim_berners-lee ) ( i put him here rather than in ` scientists ' as he had to be included somewhere ) military officers : [ wellington ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arthur_wellesley,_1st_duke_of_wellington ) , [ montgomery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernard_montgomery ) , [ nelson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horatio_nelson,_1st_viscount_nelson ) , [ churchill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winston_churchill ) ( again , a controversial inclusion but he had to get in somewhere ) philosophers : [ bacon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francis_bacon ) , [ keynes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_maynard_keynes ) , [ hobbes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_hobbes ) , [ mill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_stuart_mill ) humanitarians : [ fry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elizabeth_fry ) , [ wilberforce ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_wilberforce ) , [ nightingale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/florence_nightingale ) , [ rowntree ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_rowntree ) that should be enough reading for you . 
  i just carry [ a wad of these around ] ( http://www.sheffieldhistory.co.uk/forums/uploads/monthly_07_2010/post-822-099870200%201278444393.jpg ) , they were a 50p note for a while in 1969 and 1970 . 
  there 's a fun one from the north-east of england called the [ lambton worm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lambton_worm ) , about how a crusader saves wearside from a giant worm that was terrorising the area by eating sheep and children . 
  it 's written in our dialect as a sort of folk poetry . 
  the three are still in force as uk law , so they do apply to the entire uk even if they were n't written there . 
  just as the claim of right act is a scottish piece of constitutional legislation of wider application . 
  i mean it 's `` chuck it into a pan till it 's cooked '' you can definitely do a full english hungover as apart from the toast it 's all fried . 
  whenever this question comes up i point out that the uk does n't have a real written constitution and so i use the magna carta , the bill of rights and the petition of right which are three key constitutional documents in our system . 
  the last article of the magna carta in force is :  no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned , or be disseised of his freehold , or liberties , or free customs , or be outlawed , or exiled , or any other wise destroyed ; nor will we not pass upon him , nor condemn him , but by lawful judgment of his peers , or by the law of the land . 
  we will sell to no man , we will not deny or defer to any man either justice or right . 
  the last article of the bill of rights 's main text :  all which their majestyes are contented and pleased shall be declared enacted and established by authoritie of this present parliament and shall stand remaine and be the law of this realme for ever and the same are by their said majesties by and with the advice and consent of the lords spirituall and temporall and commons in parlyament assembled and by the authoritie of the same declared enacted and established accordingly . 
  the last article of the petition of right is basically a `` petition clause '' where they basically beg the king to accept the petition , it 's long-winded and not too interesting , e.g. 
  :  and that your majestie would be alsoe graciouslie pleased for the further comfort and safetie of your people to declare your royall will and pleasure , that in the things aforesaid all your officers and ministers shall serve you according to the lawes and statutes of this realme as they tender the honor of your majestie and the prosperitie of this kingdome . 
  oddly they have since passed a new act , the haberdashers ' aske 's charity act 2016 , which got approved by hm on 15 september [ after the finance act ] ( https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2016-09-15/debates/16091542000344/royalassent ) . 
  the last article is the thunderously dull :  6 operation of the schemes  ( 1 ) the schemes have effect subject to this act and are to be construed consistently with it . 
   ( 2 ) any provision of the schemes that is inconsistent with this act ( and in 10 particular any provision of the schemes that relates to the personal liability of the corporators of the charity , however described ) ceases to have effect . 
  i 'm not drinking it on the streets ... yet . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  maybe i 'm biased as port is actually pleasant to drink compared to white cider . 
  i wish you could get a three litre bottle ... 
  have you heard of the chilcot report ? 
  it 's basically millions of words saying that the british government put too much faith in non-verified american intelligence information in the run up to the war , ie we fucked up . 
  i think port is better value , # 7 for a bottle and it 's usually 15 % . 
  this advert which [ tried to use french ] ( https://askafrenchguy.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/nancys-petites-bites.jpg ) was hilarious for anyone who actually speaks french . 
  `` bite '' in english ( as a noun ) is ` morceau ' in french . 
  my french friends also giggle at [ this british chain of italian restaurants ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/sutton_surrey_london_-_zizzi_1.jpg ) . 
  we have an abomination of a hybrid system where metric is the default , but you can also display imperial units if you want to as well ( for example in a butcher 's you might see `` steak - # 5/lb , # 11/kg '' ) . 
  the only common things which are purely imperial are pints of beer and cider ( you can only sell in denominations of pints - like 1 pint , 1/2 pint , 1/3 pint ) and road signs which are in miles . 
  people often conversationally describe heights , weights , lengths etc. 
  in imperial as well . 
  it 's not as bad as pre-1971 when we had an imperial currency ... 
  there have been a [ succession of echr cases ] ( http://www.echr.coe.int/documents/fs_reproductive_eng.pdf ) on reproductive rights which have concluded that at least some right to have an abortion if permitted by law ( or at least to have the choice of doing so ) is a requirement under article 8 echr . 
  the echr is n't part of the eu , but they are closely linked now ever since the social charter was set up as a counterpart to the echr . 
  right now , poland 's law is similar to ireland 's and the echr has penalised ireland ( and poland ) simply for making it more difficult to get an abortion when the grounds for having one are met . 
  we 'll have to see how they react to an outright ban but i doubt poland or the eu will actively respond to any ruling . 
  this is debatable - from a constitutional law standpoint there is such a thing called `` constitutional statute '' ( to use lord justice laws ' term from * thoburn v sunderland city council * ) which are supposedly protected from * implied * repeal , basically meaning that they ca n't be restrained except where parliament does so expressly . 
  it 's a mechanism of making it harder to amend constitutional laws like you see in other countries . 
  basically they can do so with a `` simple vote '' as long as they do so expressly , not , for example , by passing a law which has the effect of overruling one of the constitutional statutes without that being its express purpose . 
  or that 's the theory , it 's never ( really ) been tested in practice . 
  all three are !, 
  the [ bill of rights ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/willandmarsess2/1/2/introduction ) is , as is [ article 1 ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/edw1cc1929/25/9/section/i ) of the magna carta ( one of only three still in force ) , and the introduction to the [ petition of right ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/cha1/3/1/section/wrapper1 ) , despite the fact that it was made pre-civil war . 
  the uk does n't have a written constitution , but we do have some important constitutional documents you can take the first article from . 
  the magna carta ( 1215 ) :  1 . 
  in the first place we have granted to god , and by this our present charter confirmed for us and our heirs for ever that the english church shall be free , and shall have her rights entire , and her liberties inviolate ; and we will that it be thus observed ; which is apparent from this that the freedom of elections , which is reckoned most important and very essential to the english church , we , of our pure and unconstrained will , did grant , and did by our charter confirm and did obtain the ratification of the same from our lord . 
  pope innocent iii. , before the quarrel arose between us and our barons : and this we will observe , and our will is that it be observed in good faith by our heirs for ever . 
  we have also granted to all freemen of our kingdom , for us and our heirs for ever , all the underwritten liberties , to be had and held by them and their heirs , of us and our heirs for ever .
