  i think the foundation of our constitution comes from the bill of rights ( 1688 ) :  and thereupon the said lords spiritual and temporal and commons , pursuant to their respective letters and elections , being now assembled in a full and free representative of this nation , taking into their most serious consideration the best means for attaining the ends aforesaid , do in the first place ( as their ancestors in like case have usually done ) for the vindicating and asserting their ancient rights and liberties declare :  - that the pretended power of suspending the laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of parliament is illegal ... a more personal approach comes from the petition of right ( 1628 ) :  ... it is declared and enacted , that from thenceforth no person should be compelled to make any loans to the king against his will , because such loans were against reason and the franchise of the land ; and by other laws of this realm it is provided , that none should be charged by any charge or imposition called a benevolence , nor by such like charge ; by which statutes before mentioned , and other the good laws and statutes of this realm , your subjects have inherited this freedom , that they should not be compelled to contribute to any tax , tallage , aid , or other like charge not set by common consent , in parliament . 
  we actually have laws in place which expressly forbid discrimination in employment or hiring based on nationality - look up the equality act 2010 . 
  i actually drew from both his 2008 and 2012 inauguration speeches for the point of the quote - if you can find a british government official saying anything close to that at any point in the last 30 years i will be impressed ( cameron 's remarks were n't about his personal faith or his beliefs or his interpretation of the bible or whatever , they were about britain as a ` christian nation ' , which , culturally , we are ) . 
  if you think i 'm somehow distorting the meaning of obama 's words , then look up his speech at the national prayer morning this year instead . 
  tony blair has said as much that politicians [ ca n't express their personal faith ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/9265571/tony-blair-wanted-to-end-speech-with-god-bless-britain.html ) in this country in a way american politicians can . 
  many pms are religious ( much more so than the regular public ) but you would n't know it from the way they go on . 
  the argument is n't whether the british state is more religious in its composition than the american state ( it is ) , the argument is whether mentioning religion in politics is a taboo in the uk . 
  if you can find a copy , kate fox 's * watching the english * has a good section on this and how we find this kind of outpouring of faith and sincerity to be embarrassing and cringeworthy . 
  a lot of people reacted badly to cameron 's comments even though they 're so mild . 
  there 's an obvious difference between the prime minister making a remark ( which was so out of the ordinary that it was focused on a lot and talked about ) , or the queen 's once-a-year christmas speech as the head of the most liberal church in mainstream protestantism , and the kind of thing you see across the water . 
  [ compare it to a recent speech by george w bush ] ( http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/dallas-ambush/read-full-transcript-of-former-president-bushs-speech-at-memorial-service/270770750 ) where he openly quotes the bible and invokes god . 
  or obama 's inauguration address :  this is the source of our confidence - the knowledge that god calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny ... that is how we will preserve our planet , commanded to our care by god . 
   not all degrees are even useful , so what if a migrant has a degree in art ? 
  i know a tonne of british and eu people who have degrees in various arts who work in journalism , publishing , the creative sector , non-profit organisations , development , and so on . 
  are those not `` useful '' ? 
  i mean , i have an arts degree and i 'm training to be a solicitor , is that not useful ? 
  it clashes with the british taboos on sincerity and open displays of religion , best exemplified when tony blair ( a fairly strong catholic ) was famously told by his spin chief alastair campbell in 2003 `` we do n't do god '' . 
  i think many northern european countries feel the same . 
  [ 62 % of eu migrants to the uk have a university degree compared to 24 % of uk workers ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/uk-magnet-highly-educated-migrants-research ) . 
  # [ chanting of ` ever closer union ' intensifies ], 
  trump has something like a -70 % approval rating with the british public , only slightly better than putin . 
  trump would n't even be in the race here . 
  not really . 
  people like to * make fun * of americans here , in the same way we like to make fun of anyone . 
  we tend to stick to certain stereotypes and despair at the politics , and above all ridicule american sincerity , which is basically a taboo in our society ( a good example of this is when politicians in america have to repeatedly praise god and jesus , which would repel 99 % of uk voters ) . 
  beyond that , american things are really popular here in the cultural sphere . 
  many people watch us sitcoms , chains like five guys and krispy kreme can charge ridiculous amounts of money because people will pay for it , and lots of american terms are slowly sneaking into our english . 
  lots of people visit america and really enjoy it . 
  some people ( usually the more right-on crowd ) have concerns about us foreign policy and things like ttip . 
  then again , we accompanied you into iraq ( lol ) . 
  i 'm disappointed in my government . 
  the rumblings are that they 're edging towards a `` hard brexit '' , which is just blindly following what was a narrow result over the edge of a cliff . 
  they should have the guts to say that they 're willing to take their time if that 's what we need to do to get a passable result . 
  leaving in a `` hard brexit '' without things like financial passporting rights will wreck a large part of our economy and leave us worse off in the long run , which is why i find it odd that the `` invoke article 50 now '' crowd seen so keen on doing it , probably cos they prefer to dream up situations where we trade wool with canada and australia . 
  the more ` polite ' terms are `` east asian '' ( for people from china , japan , korea , vietnam etc. ), 
  and `` south asian '' ( for the indian subcontinent '' . 
  oriental is still used , but usually as an adjective rather than a noun - it is n't as much of a taboo word as it is in america . 
  if we 're making vast judgments on what is safe and unsafe by anecdote , the last place i got mugged/threatened in the street was cambridge . 
  are you joking ? 
  you must be ridiculously sheltered if you think bradford feels unsafe . 
  i lived in the west end of leeds and it felt less safe than any part of bradford i 've been to . 
  and even then i was n't particularly bothered . 
  urban decay and a larger proportion of non british people do n't make an area scary by default . 
  we have the odd quandary that devolution to scotland and wales has largely been viewed as a success , whereas english local devolution has n't really done much . 
  look at hartlepool - they got an elected mayor in the early 2000s then voted to get rid of the position ten years later . 
  we do n't use them at all . 
  ml/l for liquid and g/kg for solid are the standard units of measurement , occasionally with the old imperial measurements as well ( lb , oz , floz ) . 
  we have some old-fashioned ones for french towns as well ; lyons for lyon and marseilles for marseille . 
  the only one i can think of that we use differently to you is spelling dunkerque as `` dunkirk '' . 
  i know plenty of people who still use the old names for indian places , and you still get stuff like bombay mix , bombay sapphire and so on . 
  that said , in the media it 's usually mumbai/kolkata rather than bombay/calcutta . 
  i 've been to dudley . 
  it 's a run down town with a large immigrant population . 
  like oldham or bradford , like some suburbs of paris , brussels or berlin . 
  that does n't make it a ) unsafe to go to ( i 've walked around oldham and bradford at night and during the day with no trouble whatsoever ) or b ) some kind of evil sharia no go zone . 
  i actually feel less safe wondering around my 98 % white british home town at night than i did in either of those places , cos it has a higher crime rate and fewer police . 
  i mean 95 percent of cctv cameras are privately owned , and with adequate safeguards for data in place ( which we have through the hyper strict dpa ) i really do n't see the problem with them . 
  i think so , although it would be worse if cameron was still in charge ; as far as i know , may has n't clashed with trump properly since becoming pm ( unlike cameron did ) . 
  however , she did say that he `` does not understand the uk '' and that he was talking `` nonsense '' after his muslim ban statements . 
  the main issues of contention are going to be : - trump is [ loathed ] ( http://www2.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2016/08/16/introducing-the-pbyougov-favourability-ratings-a-new-development-by-the-site/ ) by most of the british public , whereas barack obama and hillary clinton are broadly approved of . 
  this makes it hard for our government to be seen working with him . 
  - trump has a cosy relationship with putin , who , as you 'll notice , is also near-universally distrusted and disliked by the british public . 
  - trump 's policy on nato again goes against the british government position and [ the opinions of most people ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/08/02/british-public-back-nato-pact-waver-defence-some-a/ ) . 
  personally i think the us ' defence commitment to nato is a huge part of the relationship between the two countries . 
  - our government is trying to turn brexit into an `` out and into the world '' programme where we negotiate international trade deals free from the supposed incumbrances of doing it as part of the eu . 
  trump 's protectionist , anti-free-trade stance goes against this . 
  - trump is generally unpredictable , unstable and we have no idea what he would get up to , which naturally worries us . 
  see also bad teeth , sharia no-go zones , orwellian surveillance state , etc. 
  here in the wilderness beyond the eurozone i keep my foreign currency in a jar . 
  from a few trips to europe over the last few years ( among tonnes of polish , norwegian , romanian and hungarian currency ... as well as lithuanian litas from back in the day ! ), 
  i have : 1 cent - 1 ( france ) 2 cents - 3 ( france x2 , germany x1 ) 5 cents - 6 ( france x3 , ireland x3 ) 10 cents - 1 ( france ) 20 cents - 1 ( spain ) 50 cents - 2 ( france x2 ) 1 euro - 1 ( spain ) . 
  variety evidently is n't my strong suit ... 
  there 's a distinction between `` right wing '' ( i mean merkel 's cdu is a right-wing conservative party , along with people like the uk tories and the french republicans ) and the kind of right wing populism espoused by ukip , the fn , afd and so on . 
  for example , i think the links of these right wing populists to russia and their willingness to suck up to the russians runs contrary to the interests of europe itself , and i think they tacitly encourage or at least fail to condemn violence against perceived foreignness . 
  both of those things are dangerous and so that 's why i think their popularity is a problem we have to address . 
  parties like the tories suggest limiting immigration without violating fundamental rights or prejudicing the interests of our countries , which is a respectable opinion . 
  and that 's without even getting into the questionable legality of what the polish and hungarian governments have been up to in recent years . 
  i flew edinburgh - istanbul with turkish airlines a couple of years ago . 
  the plane was brand new , spotless inside , the staff were courteous and well-presented , the food on the flight was great ( grilled meat and actual fresh yoghurt with an efes ) , the seats were big and comfortable , and they had tonnes of films to pass the time ( i went for django unchained ) . 
  in summary , brilliant . 
  certainly better than pegasus , the other major turkish airline , who are admittedly a budget airline , but whose planes always seem to be falling to bits every time i fly with them . 
  generally this is only a problem in spring and summer . 
  it steps up a bit in autumn when there seem to be tonnes of spiders absolutely everywhere , but once we get into winter a ) you do n't have your windows open and b ) even if you did , there are no insects to get in . 
  from the last three months of having my windows open , the biggest culprits have been the [ bluebottle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_bottle_fly ) , the [ house fly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/housefly ) , the [ daddy longlegs ] ( http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/daddy-longlegs ) , and the occasional ladybird or moth at night . 
  outside we deal with the [ midge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/midge ) and , in the south , the occasional mosquito . 
  plus bees and wasps . 
  jayda fransen , who is the deputy leader of britain first ( hyper-christian anti-foreign hate mob extraordinaire ) is the granddaughter of dutch immigrants . 
  these people 's self-awareness level is 0 . 
  even the present subjunctive confuses some people . 
  i 've known some people wonder why we write `` the committee agreed that the meeting be scheduled '' rather than `` is/will be scheduled '' . 
  we do that as well , even though people write joined-up forms often say `` complete in block capitals '' to avoid any ambiguity . 
  also the classic royal navy one : `` to wives and girlfriends , and may they never meet '' . 
  we say `` gan hyem '' for `` go home '' , which i understand is very similar to danish !, 
  is `` red lemonade '' what we call tizer ? 
  my favourite saying from the north-east of england : * shy bairns get nee cyek * - eng . 
  `` shy children get no cake '' ; if you do n't ask for something , you wo n't get it . 
  we distinguish between `` lemonade '' ( which usually means fizzy , transparent ` soda ' like sprite ) and [ `` cloudy lemonade '' ] ( http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=254857518 ) which is the traditional stuff that is n't transparent . 
  both are lemon juice or lemon flavouring mixed with either still or sparkling water . 
  we do n't call any other fizzy drink `` lemonade '' . 
  our generic word for these kinds of drinks are ` fizzy drinks ' , or regionally ` fizzy pop ' ( north of england ) or ` juice ' ( scotland ) .
