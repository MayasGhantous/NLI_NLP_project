as far as i 'm aware , you only get asked if you want it on when you set up a new internet connection which looks like [ this ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71795000/jpg/_71795679_71795678.jpg ) for bt . 
  if you had an existing connection when they implemented it i do n't think you had to opt out ( at least i have n't had to do anything and nothing has been blocked ) . 
  yeah , i thought so but people kept spamming that it 's opt-out on the comments when the idea came to light . 
  so i thought it might have a different definition than it did in normal english . 
  http://romfordcs.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/71795679_71795678.jpg this is what it looks like when you sign up for bt atleast , i 'm not sure about the others and i do n't know enough about the words `` opt-in '' or `` opt-out '' to make the distinction whether it is or not . 
  yep norway has an estimated 15,000 british people . 
  i ca n't do it right now but the numbers are from appendix c. in http://votes-for-expat-brits.com/documents/ippr_globalbrittextforprint.pdf . 
  the official numbers from the department of work and pensions are lower than you would initally think . 
  for example spain only has just over 96,000 pensioners , with france totalling 50,000 . 
  ireland appears to have the most british pensioners in the eu at 113,000 . 
  i 'm not sure what the irish government say but from a uk home office paper they say this . 
   extrapolating from the number of passports issued each year gives an estimate of 4.5 million people with british passports living overseas ( hansard 2006 cited from sriskandarajah and drew , 2006 ) . 
  this may be an underestimate because it excludes those living abroad who renew their passports in the uk when visiting friends and family , but will also overestimate the number because it includes those only abroad for a short time ( so not really emigrants ) but whose passports are lost or stolen abroad . 
  however , this estimate is broadly similar to the number suggested by other sources . 
   the use of passports data is complicated by factors such as some overseas-issued passports being replacements for lost and stolen documents , many british people choosing to renew their passport when they are visiting the uk ( where it is less expensive and where they may still have a registered postal address ) , and some dual nationals choosing to use another country 's passport . 
  it seems as though this is n't only a case with ireland , but practically every country seems to have an undercount of passports and consulate figures compared to estimated levels . 
  for example canada has 236,660 people who definitely emigrated from britain on record , but there is an estimated 611,000 british expats living there . 
  i assume the irish discrepancies may be due to high movement between ireland and northern ireland , which might not be recorded as migration . 
  i made it because there were over 400 comments about it on an article posted 2 days ago . 
  i also wanted to learn to use qgis , if you can find data for switzerland i can make one for you , if you like that . 
  yep , these are estimates and the passport numbers are very sparse and seemingly unreliable . 
  the euobserver article used the numbers for part-time residents in ireland . 
  i used the same data as the article , however i used the fulltime figures . 
  i linked the report the numbers came from , which are in appendix c . you can see that the article uses the the same table as i did . 
  edit : the guardian and the bbc used the numbers i have in various articles , so i feel like i was justified using the estimates and not government reported passport numbers as they seem extremely low for some countries . 
  the map shows the predicted emigrants from the uk to other eu countries in 2010 found in appendix c. of [ here ] ( http://votes-for-expat-brits.com/documents/ippr_globalbrittextforprint.pdf ) . 
  i did n't include croatia because it gained eu status after this data was compiled . 
  i made the map because the post about uk emigrants [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1xie46/two_million_british_people_emigrated_to_eu/ ) , got a fair bit of traction and this appears to be the dataset they used in the story ; however , they used estimated migrants who had been living in in these countries for only a part of the year . 
  i used the same data as the article , but mapped the british citizens who lived in the eu country full time for over one year . 
  using these numbers you get around 1.8 m emigrants , rather than the  2m discussed in the article . 
  i also quickly did a world map of british [ emigrants ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nxtjevo.png ) including a table of the top 10 long term destinations . 
  i managed to clip the edge of the number of emigrants to ireland by accident , it should be 299000 if you ca n't read it . 
  q4 figures are n't out yet for the end of 2013 but : [ q1 growth ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_314093.pdf ) = 0.3 % [ q2 growth ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_326877.pdf ) = 0.7 % [ q3 growth ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_345991.pdf ) = 0.8 % ** links are pdf ** whenever the 4th quarter estimates are out we will have a better idea of the full year . 
  i just do n't think its people grow up with regularly . 
  if i have a coke or something at home i might put some ice in if i feel like it . 
  more often than not however i just do n't bother and the drink never tastes any different to me whether there is ice in or not . 
  when i was little i always asked for ice in the drinks because i used to chew the ice cubes , so if you ask you will nearly always get it . 
  i just do n't think people tend to like it because its seen as trying to cheat you out of more room for the drink , especially because free refills do n't really exist . 
  here 's the pdf of the act published last year , which includes its objectives . 
  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217298/gov-resp-justice-comm-foi-act.pdf i 've been searching for a source of where he said the title , however i ca n't find it in the guardian article or otherwise . 
  does anyone know where he said it ? 
  there 's also a bbc piece about that was written in march 2012 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17286328 . 
  i found this part the most interesting -  the starkest example of this has been in ireland , where the government introduced up-front fees for making freedom of information requests . 
  in the us successive presidents have fought battles over the scope of foi . 
  and in india currently there are efforts to constrain the extent of the right to information law which has featured in numerous controversial disputes between citizens and officials . 
   on the other hand , another expert david banisar argues that many countries with foi laws have not experienced the same kind of political backlash . 
  this seems to imply that ireland has already implemented a solution to what their government sees as a problem with foi . 
  i never said there was evidence , i just linked sources to relevant articles without any words said . 
  you just presumed it 's what i meant when i put them there . 
  well they have similar employee numbers , bnd has just over 6,000 , gchq has 5,675 permanent + 297 ` time-hire ' ( 2009-2010 ) according to wikipedia . 
  i 'm just looking at it logically , it states they and other nations have the same capabilities with the agencies that are spying . 
  just because snowden has n't released a file saying it is happening , does n't mean it 's not . 
  i 'm probably being cynical in assuming that the german government would fuck over other countries to get what it wants just like the uk would . 
  but i never stated anywhere that they are , i just provided sources to those who wanted it that points to bnd not being completely clean . 
  i hope no country is spying on any other 's but i do n't find it plausible . 
  it 's well known that france used industrial espionage in the usa back in the early 90 's , so it 's not much of a leap to presume that if they can steal from ibm they had some sort of system to keep tabs on the government . 
  well bnd obviously has the same capability as gchq and nsa since they work together and are considered equals . 
  if that is the case its logical to assume that they do similar work to other governments allies or not . 
  the original poster said that the german populous must wake up to the fact that other nations will sabotage the country if it 's to their benefit . 
  it would be naive to not say the same about germany and bnd 's work on other nations , considering it is acknowledged that they have the same capability as the nsa and gchq . 
  the brazilian government was shouting the loudest about canadian government spying on it , but it turns it brazil was doing similar work in canada . 
  snowden has n't been close to releasing everything yet , and i doubt that with the capabilities that we know bnd and most other european agencies have , that they would be the only country in europe that is n't using these types of spying techniques . 
  well i took that answer as meaning that all spy agencies have the same capabilities as each other . 
  as such they are all as bad as each other and it should be assumed that they are using everything in their power to keep tabs on other nations . 
  i did n't agree with the fact that bnd have some sort of spy base in london or washington , but they certainly have the capability just like all other spy agencies do . 
  the fact is that everything from snowden still has n't been released so until it is , we must assume that everyone is spying on everyone until it can be proved otherwise , because its ludicrous to believe that if they have the capability they would n't use it . 
  maybe i 'm just being cynical . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/01/gchq-europe-spy-agencies-mass-surveillance-snowden http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/germany-impedes-eu-privacy-efforts-despite-outrage-at-nsa-spying-a-930488.html http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;prev=_dd&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fpolitik%2fausland%2fspaeh-enthuellungen-europaeische-geheimdienste-sollen-kooperiert-haben-a-931375.html ( could n't find in the english version on the site ) . 
  not really data for the uk is pretty easy to find e.g. 
  http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/parents--country-of-birth--england-and-wales/2011/sb-parents--country-of-birth--2011.html http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/fertility-analysis/childbearing-of-uk-and-non-uk-born-women-living-in-the-uk/2011/childbearing-among-uk-born-and-non-uk-born-women-living-in-the-uk.html#tab-key-findings the average uk-born woman has 1.84 children -- an increase of 10 % in just four years . 
  http://bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24710506 there 's some more information on what this whole thing is about . 
  this has been in the pipeline since the leveson report on press ethics after the news of the world phone hacking scandal . 
  it 's to replace the old regulator , ensuring that newspapers get fines for blatant lies and making it harder for newspapers to get away with the illegal practices that have plagued the profession . 
  pssst , i think it was a joke . 
  i think the article is trying to frame the attackers as muslim and make it something to do with their ` patrol ' , however i have n't seen anything that states this was the case anywhere . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/american-student-scarred-for-life-by-bottle-attack-just-three-days-after-arriving-in-britain-8899329.html there is no mention of it in this article , and the victim stated that he was attacked because `` obviously not local '' ( no justification ) . 
  in fact the guy that was setting up the sharia zones was a white ginger guy who has already been charged and jailed as it states in your article . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz2dnkdfgqm here 's a video of the incident and it shows that there was some dialogue involved between the victim and the attackers . 
  in fact the victim does make a silly move by touching one of the attackers on the shoulder while moving towards him and raising a bottle , however the resulting attack on him is ridiculously overboard and unjustifiable . 
  the uk pop density is skewed a bit by the highlands and scotland in general . 
  in england ( where 90 % of the population live ) for example the population density is around 400/km ^ 2 . 
  for england and wales together it is 371/km ^ 2 . 
  also according to the telegraph , england has a higher density than the netherlands , but i suppose you should take it with a pinch of salt since it was from 2008 . http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/2967374/england-is-most-crowded-country-in-europe.html, 
  i would n't have a problem believing that germany was the least corrupt country either . 
  i was just saying that public perception on corruption might not tell the whole story , because in general corruption happens behind closed doors . 
  remember though that some of those are based on public perception . 
  not an actual measure, 
  i think england go ahead after the new standings come out this month though . 
  in the 1980 united states census , over 49 million ( 49,598,035 ) americans claimed english ancestry , at the time around 26.34 % of the total population and largest reported group which , even today , would make them the largest ethnic group in the united states . 
  this outnumbered the population of england at the time . 
  however now people claiming it is much lower , so it 's hard to tell what the exact figures are . 
  that ginger one was great, 
  but there are many different railway operators in the uk so how do we know which is the ` main ' one ? 
  i know prices on the east coast are different to those on west coast and so on . 
  work out at just over # 20 each if i 'm not mistaken . 
  works fine for me . 
  actually i think they got rid of those buses a year or two ago , they were all gone when i went at the start of 2012 . 
  they were replaced by arriva ones , that were far too big for the roads . 
  just saw the topic and thought it was interesting , i 'm not saying anything in that thread was non-biased or correct . 
  i saw an argument in / r/scotland recently that its not necessarily the left wing policies that are liked , its just that people in scotland hate the uk conservatives so much .
