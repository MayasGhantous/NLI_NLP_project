  maybe creating more groups like this is n't a bad idea . 
  edit : i should point out that the sas are an anti-terror unit during peace time and special ops unit during war time ( although the conspiracy guys says they perform the black ops during peace as well , but believe whatever you want to ) . 
  i mostly agree , i did however say domestic as well . 
  we need to defend from idiots at home . 
  one could argue we could increase the police force and decrease the military however , which is not something im against if i am honest . 
  although , and this is far more important , terror attacks are often performed by groups that can not be damaged by other means like economic and political ones . 
  we need a trained force well equipped to handle these threats which right now are very real . 
  but think of it like this , if they ditched their armies it would be in no position to defend itself if something threatened it , both domestic and foreign . 
  it takes years to train an army , it could take a week for something really really bad to develop . 
  while i agree with most of that , i think you forgot that the special relationship did sort of exist during the bush-blair era . 
  for example iraq ? 
  right now im looking at universities , i use many different rankings to view them which gives a broader view . 
  but my question is do people really take all these rankings as fact ? 
  my favourite experience is when i was looking around a certain university in england that is highly regarded and they used * blahblah * ranking `` because we think its fairer and more accurate '' . 
  sure , and it just so happens you are quite a bit higher in this one than in the more common rankings ? 
  genuinely interesting , but it would have been 10x better with something indicating the date / year . 
  i mean , some events i just know which gave me rough estimates like the formation of britain and prussia and more modern stuff , but it would still have been been nice . 
  why is there no `` neutral / no opinion '' button ? 
  seems stupid . 
  i prefer the history between england / great britain / uk and france . 
  we went to war a lot , but we also seemed to be allied with a lot with them at times even hundreds of years ago . 
  this . 
  as a british youth , i can confirm it happens all the time . 
  not in every group of people , but a lot of them . 
  being one from the internet group i do n't go out much ... 
  i like your comment about our food , i am seen as quite strange by my fellow peers as i tend to always eat foreign food which has a lot more flavour . 
  i rarely touch british food , except maybe fast food . 
  the underclass - welcome to the world of chavs, 
  i think there is a statistic that your picture is taken about 300 times a day in central london , but that includes private security cameras in stores . 
  its kind of strange for us also , because we have signed several deal with the french over the past couple of years to work even closer with them when it comes to military cooperation . 
  the whole drinking thing is always brought up by the people we visit and thus terrorize , alcohol is expensive here but we also seem to like to just get drunk on holiday . 
  kinda embarrassing for the rest of us . 
  brits looked down on you ? 
  how utterly disgraceful of them , i 've never known the people here to act all superior , that actually angers me that people would do that . 
  the empire stuff , as you said it is quite recent history and many people remember , but i do n't see much of that at all - ever . 
  that might just be a thing some of our older people roll out when they talk to a foreigner , but give them some credit - most powerful nation in the world to this , in 70 years . 
  the whole eu shit , im not sure where to start , you pretty much nailed it . 
  except that it is n't the only country to make exceptions , look at france and germany . 
  why would i make a post and only expect good things , in fact i was expecting much worse than what i 've seen . 
  do n't be sorry , on the contrary thanks for being honest . 
  and i can see why you hate it looking at what you 've been through . 
  just one thing though , try not to judge us all quite so badly , my generation is i think slightly better than the above , i hope . 
  yeah i thought that was n't very clear , sorry !, 
  what i mean is that we try to be quite vocal about not being pro-american , you are an example and i too say similar things . 
  but what we do , our actions , are becoming more and more american . 
  everything in the world is becoming quite americanized ( the so called american empire ) , but in the uk i ca n't help but notice its a lot faster . 
  we accept american brands , shops , films , music , food etc without so much as a glance nowadays . 
  take for example a clothes shop , go into one and how many shirts do you see with american universities labelled on them ? 
  its just we do n't notice our this sort of cultural take over , and to me its quite depressing . 
  i 've seen a few people talking about / praising british comedy , i always thought that it was pretty self contained to the uk and was n't watched much outside . 
  but that 's a thought i 'm glad is n't true . 
  the people sound a lot nicer than what i 've experienced , and i 've lived here for most of my life . 
  but that 's luck of the draw in a country i think . 
  as for your fears of the orwellian world coming true , we worry about that sometimes also . 
  it was mostly a figure of speech , i know plenty of places where there are no cameras , but it was nice being in a city or major part of a town / village where there were n't any cameras . 
  some people just do n't like images of them being stored like that . 
  the fact there are very few in other countries comparatively , or back in 99 that was the case . 
  maybe in what we say , but what we do and own ? 
  so much stuff here is americanized its insane , we just dont notice stuff like that ... 
  maybe we are tooting our horn too much , but does n't every country once in a while ? 
  we have the olympics but the more cynical part of me says that the government is promoting this to draw attention away from its faults . 
  in what way do you like it ? 
  im just curious that 's all . 
  maybe its because the uk is the third largest economy in the region and a major power ( dwindling though i 'll admit ) . 
  they do n't want to lose it if they can . 
  i thought red dwarf was only liked here , i love you guys for having such good taste . 
  it probably is , but its by far the most noticeable . 
  thats a good point actually , never thought about it . 
  but i think they do store it all for several years , it can be used as evidence so they might try to keep as much as they can just as a fail safe, 
  could you explain why we are second favourite ? 
  i do n't mean why not first , but why so high ? 
  you yourself said that the munich agreement was n't exactly well received ( why should it have been ? 
  ) , and i do n't really know of any significant cultural or political ties between our nations . 
  i dont care if it works or not , they are still there and take my picture all the time . 
  there are thousands of photos of me by now stored away in some database ... 
  500 photos of my mug a day if i go into london . 
  yes , i was basing my point off that very fact with obama calling france their greatest ally . 
  i think that the us should n't declare anyone as being their bestest ally at all as it makes everyone else jealous and fight for it . 
  although maybe thats what they want . 
  i think we some times like to think of ourselves as a nation in the middle of the atlantic rather than 50km away from mainland europe . 
  i dont know , it just seemed that when we told them where we from it was somewhat negative , whereas the friends we were on holiday with who were from italy didnt seem to get that . 
  an excellent olympics ? 
  why thank you . 
  i think the feeling of teaming up with the us is slowly breaking down , in both countries . 
  while i do agree we do n't make anything , does that matter really ? 
  we are a market economy are a banking nation . 
  surely a man with an employment history such as his would come to acknowledge the uk as a finance capital and as such a very important place in the modern world . 
  in the end though he really did just make a stupid decision , hes annoyed quite a few people over here . 
  and this country may not be as powerful as it once was but it still has a large influence , both in the un and with its media companies . 
  edit : looks like im just a dumb sheep who believes we dont make anything , cheers for correcting me guys :d, 
  so i do n't actually know if this sort of post is allowed , i tried looking for rules but i could n't see anything . 
  anyway , as i said i traveled europe a few weeks back and i 'm from the uk . 
  whenever i told them i was from the uk it was n't a brilliant reaction , i think the term `` police state '' popped up in austria , slovakia , poland and germany . 
  i 've got to admit , walking down a street with no cameras is nice . 
  the people we spoke to were nice , and also said that the british people on the whole were nice ( like any country i guess ) but that the nation was `` broken '' as it were . 
  just wondering what the general consensus of the uk is in europe , hoping you can enlighten me ? 
  ** edit : ** ok maybe not a general consensus , that 's stupid , but what are your thoughts ? 
  ** edit2 : ** just though of it , the union jack was quite popular ( as in i noticed it a lot ) as a symbol to put on clothing etc , do you like it or something ? 
  ** obligatory edit the morning after posting : ** i 'm finding it quite interesting to see what all your opinions are , both good and bad . 
  although there seem to be many more positive replies than i was expecting , there seems to be a general consensus as to whats bad - firstly binge drinking and our nations ability to get pissed everywhere .
