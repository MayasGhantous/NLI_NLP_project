  well you were obviously never into scotland anyway with that attitude . 
  could not have picked a worse country to do this in . 
  there is cheese oil . 
  dairy gold . 
  can i ask , does having basically three languages ( french , italian , and german ? ), 
  make administration difficult in switzerland ? 
  indeed . 
  this case is extremely high profile . 
  indeed . 
  everyone is a racist these days hmmm ? 
  enjoy your far right movement . 
  yes you 're calling him a racist over nothing ? 
  and this is how you get a far right movement in your country guys ^ do n't properly address racial problems until things boil over and in desperation people turn to the nutcases . 
  next stop : ukip in britain . 
  ahhhh that obnoxious attitude . 
  could only be america . 
  you 'll never see england flying a black flag . 
  ever . 
  release ... the sheep . 
  ... and slamond would be ... robb stark ? 
  no this is n't right . 
  more of you ?!, 
  everyone . 
  they 're here again !, 
  sound the alarm !, 
  scotland is an actual country going back thousands of years . 
  how the hell do americans find this place ? 
  you 're not part of europe damn you . 
  stop pretending . 
  i did not realize they had kek in prison . 
  now i know . 
   rotterdam i 've been there . 
  the industrial side of it is like some bleak terminator 2 hellscape . 
  literally just machines and factories but no humans . 
  drunk ? 
  is whistling ... bad ? 
   was playing within the bounds of international law ( on extremely shakey grounds ) at the time ? 
  barely . 
  now ? 
  yes it seems they broke international law . 
   germany in the late 30 's . 
  japan at the same time . 
  both very popular with the people . 
  both international pariahs . 
  this is what worries me . 
  deeply . 
  i agree with you . 
  but one of the things i hate about modern art is that `` anything can be art '' which is also bullshit . 
  you can * call * anything art . 
  but that does n't magically make it so . 
  some people will exploit the current attitude to modern art to produce racist bullshit and get away with it . 
  so is what he produced art ? 
  sadly by today 's standards yes . 
  you 're probably wrong on this one i regret to say . 
  pretty gross to be honest . 
  i do n't think jail time is appropriate though . 
  community service would be better . 
  yep . 
  vast cultural differences . 
  i 've reported him/her for spam . 
  it 's tedious . 
  exactly . 
  ha-hhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaa !, 
  well done indeed !, 
  that is in fact numberwang !, 
  alright chaps let 's go again ; 9977254302343284623847234906809486549682342823522391198745398754857349573984583490102937464\u738b43534758458375934573985739878008513374728393929191911119193958585843985845039548485757579302020202828349865069568508094580945, 
  actually mate not using regulation switched set oxford rules . 
  that 's just a half-semiwang . 
  stop trying to make everyone panic to get readers . 
  it 's alright belgium i 'm sure they did n't mean anything by it . 
  complaining 2 . 
  queuing 3 . 
  numberwang, 
  they 're all over reddit . 
  had an amazing non-conversation yesterday ; http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2e1i6r/patient_with_als_regains_ability_to_talk_walk/cjv5p0q, 
  we did n't gun down and * kill * anyone . 
  again ... 
  we did n't gun anyone down ... again !, 
  did you ever see the documentary about him that had his brother ? 
  i think his brother is mentally handicapped or developmentally disabled . 
  was heartbreaking watching him trying to come to terms with it . 
  yep . 
  do n't agree either . 
  they need to be locked up and given particularly aggressive psychological counseling . 
  ww2 was a grim time . 
   collapsed while pursuing two robbery suspects and later died my word . 
  we did n't kill anyone again !, 
  god they really want us to panic about this one do n't they ? 
   that 's why there 's 50 posts a day 50 posts a day you say ? 
  why that 's as many as 5 tens ... really though your country just looks scary from across the atlantic . 
  i would n't visit out of choice . 
  your police just look like surly black clad military . 
  yep . 
  generally the police over here can be quite nice . 
  they 're seen more as civil servants most of the time . 
  how they avoid getting pissed off at some of the people they have to deal with is impressive . 
  if the food you eat at home is nhs hospital quality i feel bad for you . 
  nice . 
  i really am serious cheers ( :, 
  really ?
