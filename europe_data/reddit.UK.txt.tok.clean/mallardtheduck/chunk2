  would you be happy to ignore them because `` they 're not very good at it '' ? 
  the reason why there are more deaths on the hamas side is because you 've got a fight between a modern , well-trained and extremely well-equipped military force and a bunch of radicals with obsolete weapons , little training and no regard for either their own lives or the civilians around them . 
  of course the violence is evil and should end , but israel 's position is at least understandable . 
  generally , any descriptive words you find in the name of a nation are not true of that nation . 
   the former conservative cabinet minister lord tebbit has said he believes there `` may well '' have been a political cover-up over child abuse in the 1980s . 
  that 's hardly conclusive . 
  pretty much all he 's said is that attitudes at the time make the idea of a cover-up plausible . 
  it 's a big leap to go from there to believing it actually took place . 
  i 'd rather wait for the police and other agencies to complete their investigations than put my stock in inflammatory headlines manufactured by the media to sell newspapers . 
  if it 's true , then it 'll be revealed . 
  then the eu/use would just `` update '' their treaties so that you 're either a full member or completely excluded , just like they did with the treaty of lisbon , thus forcing other nations to surrender their sovereignty or face economic ruin . 
  various pro-eu groups have been talking about `` the united states of europe '' for decades . 
  that is quite clearly their overall aim , to make europe a single nation based on the model of the usa . 
  if the united states of america , with all its distinct cultural groups can call itself `` one nation '' , then so could a `` use '' . 
  not to mention that the usa was originally made up almost exclusively of europeans ... having a trade organisation , to manage interoperability , standards , descriptions of goods , etc. 
  makes sense . 
  this is effectively what the eec was . 
  having co-operation on law enforcement also makes sense when the borders are so open . 
  however , the eu goes well beyond that . 
  it 's effectively a whole extra hierarchy of government on top of the national governments . 
  a hierarchy that is becoming ever more powerful and is significantly less accountable and less democratic . 
  ( e.g. 
  the council has equal power to the parliament , but is not elected and has wildly disproportionate voting . ), 
  your overwhelmingly negative portrayal of `` nationalism '' vs. your ridiculously optimistic `` eurofederalism '' perhaps ? 
  so , basically you 're saying anyone who does n't bow down to the eu is a racist bigot ? 
   nobody is under any assumption that europe is a `` nation '' no , but they want it to become one . 
   of course there is . 
  there 's a massive difference - in goals , in politics , in values , and - most of all - in position on the political spectrum . 
  the difference is _ which _ nation they are `` nationalist '' for . 
  either the hypothetical future `` nation of europe '' or their current nation . 
  that 's the point i 'm trying to make . 
  they do n't have any more `` in common '' than a french nationalist has in common with a german nationalist , but they are both nationalists . 
  there is nothing any better or worse about being `` pro-eu '' than it is being `` pro-some-other-geopolitical-entity '' , yet many seem to want to portray the eu as some kind of futuristic utopia , when all it is is yet another government , not better or worse than those it tries to control . 
  you 're just splitting hairs over semantics . 
  the point is that there 's really no great difference between being pro-eu and being pro-some-eu-country . 
  it 's no more different than a german nationalist is to a french nationalist . 
  i think the thing that people have failed to realise is that `` federalism '' _ is _ `` nationalism '' . 
  the only `` difference '' is what the `` nation '' is . 
   you know that reddit threads are submissions of links , right ? 
  to a newspaper article ? 
  seriously ? 
  that 's your `` decades of research '' ? 
   it 's called a democracy , not an aristocracy you know . 
  the demos should get some say over the issues , not politicians controlled by private interests . 
  you have a vote , use it . 
  or do something else , if you feel that will help . 
  sorry , there seems to have been some sort of mistake , i asked for research . 
  you 've provided me with a link to another reddit thread . 
  while i 'm sure it 's fascinating , do you have anything that 's , maybe , `` peer reviewed '' or at least written by someone with verifiable credentials ? 
   while the eurozone is a mess , the us , japan and uk are doing considerably better . 
  which says a lot about the extent to which eurozone countries have difficulty controlling their economies after giving up so much of their financial sovereignty . 
  i do n't think your attempts at demonising politicians is worth responding to . 
  unless you 're suggesting some kind of revolution ( which , history has shown , rarely improves the situation ) , you 've got no choice but to `` trust '' * them . 
  \\* i do n't think `` trust '' is really the right word , but i ca n't think of an alternative right now . 
  `` respect '' ? 
  `` accept '' ? 
  something along those lines ... 
  care to site some of this `` research '' instead of just asserting its existence ? 
  politicians are _ experts _ at finding `` easy '' solutions . 
  if there were one , somebody would have implemented it by now . 
  the fact that no western government has been able to `` solve '' the current economic woes is pretty convincing evidence that doing so is _ hard _ . 
   `` the new deal '' worked well in the resource-rich , infrastructure-poor ( at the time ) united states . 
  was n't much of a `` thing '' over in europe . 
  germany did invest in major infrastructure projects ( as well as re-armament ) , but most of the pre-war efforts had no more impact than the schemes being employed by current governments . 
   why did the politicians of europe not care to apply any of the lessons learned during the crisis in the 30s to this crisis we 're going through now ? 
  because the crisis of the 30s was `` solved '' by the biggest and most deadly war in history ? 
  i 'd love to see you suggest that germany follow the same strategy now as they did in the 30s ... 
  i do n't know about merkel specifically , but are you seriously suggesting that politicians the world over have n't been doing their best to create jobs and recover their economies in response to the `` global economic crisis '' ? 
   making the same promise again and again and failing to act on it is just lying . 
  it would be , if that was what was happening . 
  turns out , fulfilling that promise is a _ lot _ harder than anyone expected . 
  it 's not `` lying '' to promise to attempt something and then fail in that attempt , only to promise to try again , in fact , that 's a positive attribute called `` persistence '' . 
   cemeterys are getting short on space . 
  cemeteries have been `` short on space '' for over 100 years . 
  cemertery space was at such a premium in the mid-19th century that some cemetery operators could afford to run [ their own railway ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_necropolis_railway ) just to transport cadavers and mourners . 
  why is the lack of compelling parties/candidates the electorate 's fault ? 
  so , you 're able to discern who those who did n't vote would have voted for if they did ? 
  in that case , we could save a lot of money by scrapping elections and just use your clairvoyance !, 
  alternatively , you can just admit that you _ do n't know _ what the result would have been if more people had voted , rather than appealing to unprovable supposition . 
  that 's not that old . 
  most trains are designed to have a lifespan of _ at least _ 30 years . 
  50 is n't particularly unusual . 
   if you are against [ ... whoever ... ] you are against all that is good in this world . 
  i do n't think we need the little flag to tell that you 're an american ... 
  the entire map is one colour , with no borders . 
  by your logic , it 's also showing significant parts of eastern ukraine and possibly parts of georgia and kazakhstan as `` russia '' ( depending on the scale/orientation , the coastline does n't seem to match google maps ' version , so it 's hard to work out ) . 
  or , they just have n't shown any borders on the map ... 
  we ca n't even get `` civilian '' botnet operators ( you know , _ actual _ criminals ) arrested . 
  the chances of getting a bunch of government agents arrested is zero . 
   everyone gets a basic income that is supposed to cover your basic need . 
  you want more ? 
  go and find a job !, 
  if you have a job and earn , say , chf 5000 , does that mean you have a total income of 5000 or 7500 ? 
  _ lots _ of people are `` public servants '' ; teachers , doctors , police , traffic wardens , etc. 
  should they all be banned from having proper internet access ? 
  what 's this `` secure network '' you 're talking about ? 
  the network at portcullis house is unlikely to be anything special ; anything sensitive that ministers need to access will be done via their department networks , with _ much _ stricter security controls and almost certainly department-issued devices . 
  looks like a small number of malware-infected pcs have skewed the statistics , definately . 
  yes , some organisations are like that . 
  others have different approaches , only requiring minimum standards for security software and updates , etc.
