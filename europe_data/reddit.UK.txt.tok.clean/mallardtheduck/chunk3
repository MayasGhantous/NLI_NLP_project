  some businesses operate entirely on a `` bring your own device '' ( byod ) basis , especially when the people using the network are n't directly employed in the same organisation as the it department , which is roughly similar to how mps operate . 
  so , once you become an mp , you 're supposed to be banned from accessing the internet except through official government channels !? 
  wow . 
  you 're all for laissez-faire internet access for the general public , but mps and their employees should be trapped in a big-brother bubble ? 
  i know `` hypocrisy '' is a very overused word these days , but yeah ... 
  they are . 
  that 's where the `` 300,000 attempts '' statistic comes from . 
  also , they do n't / ca n't control what mps and parliamentary employees access on their own devices on their home connections ; the malware wo n't immediately evaporate once they enter portcullis house . 
   what sort of websites would they be on to get those types of third-party software and pop-ups ? 
  try browsing the web without an ad-blocker for a few weeks , you 'll see ...  not only that , but surely there is some sort of security/filtering setup . 
  yep , and that 's the system that 's generated this ' 300,000 attempts ' statistic . 
   those in government who are making informed decisions should have a basic understanding of common things . 
  actually , in a proper democracy , they should have a level of understanding that matches the average person , unless their ministerial position requires more expertise . 
  ( personally , i disagree with the mixed legislature/executive roles in the british parliamentary system , as it leads to this exact conflict , among others . ), 
  have you been on the internet without an ad-blocker recently ? 
  it takes more than `` common sense '' to stay clear of explicit ads and malware . 
  it might come naturally to those of us young enough to have grown up with computers and who have an interest in it , but most people just consider a computer an `` appliance '' and do n't give a second thought to how it works . 
  they do n't know how to judge the trustworthiness of a website , which are the safe places to download software , etc. 
  these are learned skills , not `` common sense '' . 
  yeah , it 's pretty clear that they 're using every single blocked http request as an `` attempt to access '' . 
  one page that attempts to load 10 images from a shady server ? 
  10 `` attempts '' . 
  yeah , if they 're not it experts , how can they run a country ? 
   recovery was always going to happen - it 's the boom-bust cycle . 
  expect another bust in a decade or so . 
  which the country was completely unprepared for , thanks to labour 's `` end of boom and bust '' rhetoric . 
  the `` bust '' would n't have been nearly so bad had labour not squandered the `` boom '' years . 
   for the tories to have something to brag about they would have to be able to show recovery above and beyond that which might have been expected anyway - one measure for that could be uk growth in comparison with other economies in europe . 
  no , the country just has to be doing better than how it would have done with labour in charge . 
  based on labour 's statements during the last election , such as planning to `` delay '' cuts so as not to `` jeopardise the recovery '' , it 's very clear that they had little understanding of the magnitude of the crisis and no long-term plan . 
  the conservative party has been far from perfect and have made a lot of unpopular decisions , but i think it 's pretty clear that the long-term outlook is better because of them . 
  in order for a substantial market for recycle ( d | able ) material to exist the cost of buying the material and manufacturing goods from it has to be comparable to the cost of manufacturing from `` new '' material or other sources . 
  since the uk does not have a particularly large manufacturing industry and the cost of shipping the material to places with larger manufacturing industries ( e.g. 
  the far east ) usually exceeds the cost of acquiring the same material locally , it can be difficult to find a buyer for domestic recycling , even with government subsidy . 
  so much so that the amount awaiting a buyer has been known to exceed the amount of available storage , leading to `` recycling '' collections going to landfill . 
  that 's assuming there is sufficient market for recycle ( d | able ) glass and paper . 
  i know there have been news reports of this not being the case in the uk . 
  it would be interesting to know how much waste actually gets recycled , rather than collected as recycling , stored in a warehouse for a few months and then dumped because nobody wants to buy it . 
  iirc , the latter still counts as `` recycling '' under eu rules . 
  more reliable than imaginations ... 
   yes , because all private companies use tax havens . 
  all of them . 
  government can be trusted to spend its money in the best possible way with no wastage . 
  saying `` a is better than b '' is not the same as saying `` a is perfect '' . 
  i think history has shown that the ( uk ) government is pretty darned good at spending money wisely . 
  not perfect , but pretty good . 
  it 's a fact that many businesses and their shareholders use tax loopholes . 
  governments do not - they have no need to . 
  it 's almost certain that some of the profits made by water suppliers end up in tax havens . 
  on second thought , let 's not go to sligo . 
  it is a shelly place . 
  international law and convention does n't change based on where you live . 
  the fact is that it 's the neighbouring countries that have the greatest obligation . 
  i 'd be entirely happy if the uk government made an agreement with greece and/or turkey to take in an agreed number of refugees . 
  there was a refugee crisis close to britain 100 years ago , during the german invasion of belgium . 
  during that time , britain took in over 200,000 refugees ( belgium is a small country and many more settled in france , which had much greater cultural similarity ) . 
  i 'm sure if it were to happen again , we 'd respond similarly . 
  what we can not have is the chaos that 's being caused all over europe as thousands of undocumented , unregistered migrants ( of which at least 75 % are young males ) traipse across europe , demanding treatment and welfare that often exceeds what current citizens receive . 
  not only is it unfair to those who follow normal , legal means to migrate to europe , it also puts other refugees who seek only safety at risk . 
  is turkey or greece safe for refugees ? 
  that 's the only relevant question . 
  if they are , then the refugees have an obligation to register there . 
  it 's then up to those countries to seek whatever international aid they need to provide for and , where agreed , resettle them . 
  if they are not ( and there 's a valid argument that turkey may not be safe for refugees of certain ethnicities ) then the same question applies to the next country and so on . 
  certainly , by the time they arrive in places like austria and germany , they have passed through several safe countries . 
  how about linking to the actual [ convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/protect/protection/3b66c2aa10.pdf ) rather than a set of lesson plans in the `` educational resources for teachers '' section . 
  note that the actual convention requires that refugees respect the laws and regulations of the country they have arrived in ( article 2 ) and only provides protection from penalties for otherwise illegal entry/presence in a country if they come _ directly _ from an unsafe country and present themselves to authorities for registration _ without delay _ ( article 31 ) . 
  since many of the current migrants seeking refuge in europe have not honoured these articles ( particularly 31 ) they should be subject to arrest and legal penalty for their illegal actions . 
   i 'm sure there are people using the crisis to sneak their way into eu , but i yet have to see numbers from credible sources [ from the bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34173252 ) :  in the first seven months of 2015 , germany received almost 200,000 requests for asylum . 
  more than four in 10 of those applicants came from the western balkans . 
  [ chart listing origin countries of mirgrants ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/abb5/production/_85075934_migrants_numbers__chart-01.png ) . 
  those numbers also show that only around 60 % of migrants are `` displaced by war '' . 
   we do owe them asylum from war , in accordance with 1951 refugee convention from said convention :  every refugee has duties to the country in which he finds himself , which require in particular that he conform to its laws and regulations as well as to measures taken for the maintenance of public order . 
  also :  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , coming * directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened * in the sense of article 1 , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , * provided they present themselves without delay * to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  since refugees in europe are not `` coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened '' and in many cases are refusing to present themselves to authorities for registration , european countries have every right to apply legal penalties for their illegal entry into their territories . 
   the rules which set up the systemic failure to perform in accordance with our responsibilities what rules are you talking about ? 
  since croatia does not share a land border with the refugees origin countries and the numbers coming directly by sea are negligible , if not zero , the croatian government has very little `` responsibility '' towards them . 
  i do n't think these migrants have encyclopedic knowledge of the travel connections in northern europe . 
  if all you have is a map and you 're expecting to have to walk significant distances , then going through denmark looks like the best route . 
   to say that germany is n't the popular target shows blatant lack of knowledge of what is happening . 
  it 's clearly one of the popular targets , but then obviously so is sweeden . 
  why else would so many be attempting to _ leave _ germany heading north ? 
  the terrorists are taking advantage of the instability , but they did n't create it . 
  syria started as a civil uprising , just like libya or egypt . 
  propping up the assad government ( which has already shown that it 's willing to use chemical weapons against civilians ) wo n't achieve any long-term stability . 
   the majority , aka the largest minority a majority is  50 % , not `` the largest minority '' . 
  if the eu wants to have a universal immigration policy ( which would be a good thing ) , it needs to go through a full democratic process . 
  your system just makes the eu the `` fourth reich '' of germany ... 
  and ignore the ~ 80 % of eu nationals that do n't live in those two countries ? 
  sounds _ very _ democratic ... 
   ship them back whenever the conflict ends during 2014 there were over 600,000 applications for asylum in the eu . 
  of those , somewhere in the region of 200,000 ( ~ 33 % ) are from countries with no current internationally recognised conflicts . 
  while i 'm sure some of those are minority groups fleeing civil oppression , the vast majority are economic migrants . 
  ( based on data from the [ un refugee agency ] ( http://popstats.unhcr.org/en/asylum_seekers ) and [ geneva academy of international humanitarian law and human rights ' rule of law in armed conflict project ] ( http://www.geneva-academy.ch/rulac/index.php ) ), 
   double-walls filled with sand or , you know , [ sandbags ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sandbag ) ... 
  so basically , the majority of people support the status quo . 
  those in the euro want to keep it , but nobody else particularly wants to join it . 
  if she encouraged them to open fire ( a claim that seems pretty dubious from the sources ) , it 's a pretty stupid and unethical thing to do , but at the same time , any soldier who takes orders from a freaking _ journalist _ is a disgrace to their uniform who needs to be courtmarshalled immediately . 
   nobody cares if an intelligence service spies on another intelligence service . 
  that is actually their job .
