  what ? 
  you 're comparing 1.2 million through legal means over ~ 50 years to roughly ~ 15,000 per year ( your `` 50 '' number is nonsense ) crossing the channel illegally ? 
  what bearing does one have on the other ? 
  you 've offered no explanation as to why you 're singling out pakistanis . 
  they 're not the largest group of foreign-born people in the uk ( they 're third , after indians and polish ) , nor are they any more likely to be `` poorly integrated '' than any other . 
  as far as i can tell , you 're just expressing racial prejudice . 
  lulz . 
  lulz . 
  you gave about 1-2 million visas 11,000 visa in one year . 
  most british pakistani 's are british citizens with no need for a visa . 
  for comparison , france has an ( estimated ) 6 million citizens of north african ethnicity . 
   oh come on . 
  and calais exists just to annoy the uk maybe too ? 
  is the entirety of calais built specifically to hold people trying to enter the uk illegally ? 
  is the housing that you 're building nearby ? 
  yes . 
  notice the difference ? 
   then , click on the link . 
  and watch the pictures and video . 
  how is this different from the half-dozen or so other `` clearouts '' that have been done over the years ? 
  what 's going to stop the camps re-establishing in a couple of months ? 
  like i said , i 'll believe that there 's a genuine will to solve the problem when i see it . 
   at no point did the english did anything else than constantly bitching , tossing a couple millions declaring it 'll magically solve everything and asked the lowly french peasants to deal with the crisis for them then complaining loudly every single second because there 's a couple incident from time to time . 
  why is several thousand undocumented migrants camping in northern france the uk 's responsibility ? 
  it is n't . 
  the uk has no obligation to pay france to enforce their own laws . 
  we provide money partly out of goodwill and partly to help secure our trading interests . 
  maybe we should just stop paying ...  your real social problem ( people that refuse firmly to integrate ) come from pakistan but you gave them even more visa than we allowed illegals to come in the whole of europe last year and yet you only complain about the hundreds that make it illegally each year from france or so . 
  that makes no sense . 
  how many of the people camped in calais are from pakistan ? 
  none ( to within a reasonable margin for error ) . 
  almost all pakistanis immigrating to the uk do so via legal means . 
  less than 2 % of uk immigrants come from pakistan and people of pakistani birth make up around 6 % of the population . 
  in 2014 ( the most recent year that i can find figures for ) around 11,000 pakistanis were admitted into the uk ( most on short-term visas ) , during that same year , around 40,000 illegals were _ arrested _ by french authorities . 
  many more were not arrested . 
  so unless the number of pakistanis entering the uk _ massively _ increased in 2015 ( to the point where pakistan 's own population would be shrinking ) your claim that '' [ the uk ] gave them [ pakistanis ] even more visa than we allowed illegals to come in the whole of europe last year '' is complete and utter nonsense . 
   we even built housing closeby for that very recently . 
  housing close to calais ? 
  you mean a convenient base for future attempts to enter the uk ? 
   [ `` jungle '' which is ( currently ) getting emptied/demolished ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12106792/migrant-crisis-bulldozers-start-clearing-parts-of-calais-jungle-in-peaceful-operation.html ) , which is exactly why they made a run for the ferry and hide away . 
  every previous time there 's been a `` clear out '' they just set up camp a mile down the road a few months later . 
  this has been going on for the better part of two decades . 
  at no point has the french government demonstrated any resolve to properly deal with the problem . 
   so we tell them `` apply in france or get evicted '' , but hey now a part of them hide so it 's not that easy . 
  no you do n't . 
  that 's what causes this problem . 
  i 'd hardly call the huge camps around calais `` hiding '' . 
   but displaying this statue in a public space means that rhodes is still being honored . 
  how ? 
  there are many statues and monuments to people/events that do n't fit with modern morality . 
  [ winston churchill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statue_of_winston_churchill,_parliament_square ) was ( by modern standards ) a racist and mysoginist , [ field marshall haig ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/earl_haig_memorial ) was a notoriously callous military leader whose actions lead to the deaths of many thousands , [ oliver cromwell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statue_of_oliver_cromwell,_westminster ) is considered by many to have ruled as a religious tyrant and killed thousands in wars to control ireland and scotland , [ genghis khan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genghis_khan_equestrian_statue ) killed a greater proportion of the earth 's population than adolf hitler in a series genocidal wars ( and had a statue built in 2008 , so actually honoured recently ) , [ stalin ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/russia-moscow-graves_near_and_in_kremlin_wall.jpg ) 's purges killed hundreds of thousands ... 
  need i go on ? 
  putting up a statue is an honour . 
  leaving a statue standing is respect for history . 
  it means that the people who lay down the flowers still feel an emotional connection to the people the monument represents . 
  nobody is laying down flowers at this statue . 
  nobody lays down flowers at monuments for wars that are beyond a few generations ' living memory ( e.g. 
  english civil war memorials , napoleonic war memorials , ancient monuments in rome or egypt , etc. 
  ) , but we ( humanity ) keep them standing because they 're part of history , not because we condone the things they represent . 
   statues are built to honor certain persons , and they honor them not only at the time they revealed , but as long as they exist . 
  totally disagree . 
  a statue ( or any other monument ) is an expression of the feeling at the time it is built . 
  its continued existence only shows that the subject was once honoured , not that they still are . 
  nobody 's proposing to `` honour him with a statue '' . 
  that happened in 1911 . 
  leaving a historic statue standing is not the same as building a new one . 
   you check their mental state which really helps if their gun is stolen or their mental state changes over time ... or once the original owner dies ...  you ensure they buy special safes for storage and use them you 'd have to do spot inspections on people 's houses to ensure that they 're using them , which is quite invasive ... also , if they 're using the gun for personal protection , it wo n't be in the safe ; it 'll be on/near their person and thus vulnerable to being stolen ( plenty of people still get mugged while carrying in the us ) . 
   you register their serial numbers which can be removed and also do n't help very much if the gun is stolen . 
   unique print on the shell both the impression of the hammer on the shell and the striations on the bullet as it passed through the barrel will naturally change over time due to wear and can easily be changed deliberately . 
   you make them accountable for the ammo . 
  how ? 
  you 'd have to do something like giving every bullet a unique serial number and having the buyer fill in a form for each bullet fired . 
  utterly impractical and easily circumvented . 
   would it be different if the public had pistols ? 
  maybe . 
  would the overall annual death toll due to both criminal use of firearms and the need for police to always carry decrease ? 
  almost certainly not . 
   `` the impact of climate change as a driver of human migration is expected by many to dwarf all others . '', 
  from the very next sentence : `` still , certain frequently repeated forecasts of the number of people who stand to be displaced by climate change are not informed by a complete understanding of migration dynamics . '', 
  and then there 's the fact that you clearly did n't notice that i posted more than one source ...  to summarize previous case studies in chronic and sudden onset disaster areas , a short to medium term increase and intensification of typical labour migration should be expected out of degraded and drought/famine areas , while initial local displacement will characterize movements from sudden onset disaster areas . 
  a small share of migrants may choose to permanently relocate ( case studies have noted a range from none to 30 % ) . 
  no mass migrations should or are expected to occur ( perch-nielsen , 2004:95 ) . 
  these findings deviate substantially from more egregious estimates from the ` environmental refugee ' literature , mainly because such discussions fail to take into account human reaction and adaptation to change ( black , 2001 ) . 
  the third source uses three different scenarios ( which it refers to as `` highly speculative '' ) to place the effect on immigration as somewhere between a 5 % increase and 300 million people . 
  none of your links even mention any effect that climate change might have on immigration . 
  while there have been studies on the subject and many expert groups recognise there is significant potential for climate-related events to increase immigration , most studies that i can find do not draw firm conclusions and recognise that more research is needed . 
  ( [ a ] ( http://siteresources.worldbank.org/extsocialdevelopment/resources/sdccworkingpaper_migrationandconflict.pdf ) [ few ] ( http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/climate-change-and-migration-dynamics ) [ examples ] ( http://www.iisd.org/pdf/2008/migration_climate.pdf ) ) . 
  there are also many attempting to apportion all current migration to climate change to the exclusion of all other factors ( [ apparently the rise of isis is primarily due to a drought in syria ... ] ( http://time.com/4024210/climate-change-migrants/ ) ) . 
  it 's almost impressive what you can `` prove '' when you cherry-pick the evidence ...  i too work in this field that 's not surprising . 
  many people who work in specific fields have a tendency to overestimate the importance of that field and have difficulty seeing the larger picture . 
   coming ** directly ** from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened once they 've arrived in the eu , they are no longer in a territory where life or freedom is threatened and therefore they can be prosecuted for crossing additional borders . 
  the russian federation is the legal successor of the soviet union . 
  russia was saying it was terrorism within hours of the crash . 
  unless you 're saying that the us and uk predicted it ... 
   the problem is it took so long to establish that it was terrorism it 's still not established . 
  russian officials have been pushing the terrorism theory since the moment the plane went down , long before there was any evidence to support that hypothesis . 
  the egyptian , french , irish and german officials actually involved in the investigation have yet to confirm it . 
  it 's very possible that it was a bomb , but i 'm personally waiting for an unbiased official confirmation before taking it as fact . 
  which is the massive problem with coalitions that electoral reform groups like to sweep under the carpet ; if you end up with a coalition government , all members of it can claim that they `` ca n't '' keep their election promises because they did n't win outright . 
  what you end up with is a government that is _ less _ accountable to the people .
