against . 
  did n't catch that the first time . 
  what a fucking shambles that is going to turn out to be . 
  as a great nationalist philosopher once said , `` it 's better to wear the helmet of a red army soldier than to live on a diet of hamburgers in brooklyn '' . 
  similarly , for the people of ukraine , it 's better to live side by side with their slavic brothers than to surrender their cultural heritage and economic destiny to the eu and america . 
  i 'm not a ukip supporter . 
  it 's the eu-america-kiev ilk that are shelling cities and murdering civilians . 
  the ukrainian soldiers would better serve their nation turning their guns on kiev instead of maintaining their fight for the half-revolution they so blindly follow . 
  they replaced one pack of native dogs calling the shots with rats from america and western-europe . 
  so-called european leaders that bend their will to american foreign policy are the traitors and the day they are brought to justice is swiftly approaching . 
  no , they are not ` traitors ' . 
  there is nothing treacherous about observing an election . 
  even if america 's puppets in brussels do n't recognize it . 
  the eu should have no right to impose sanctions . 
  why should they be protested or ousted ? 
  they 've been very clear about their position with what 's going on in eastern ukraine/novorossiya . 
  obviously those positions resonate with their supporters . 
   also like you said , it is really weird that people are so against immigration from eu , but are totally silent about people coming from non-western cultures . 
  it 's not weird , it 's motivated purely by fear . 
  european immigrants are the only immigrants you can criticise in any way without being automatically assumed to be a ` racist ' ( and even then the word is still used like ` witch ' was during the inquisition ) . 
  the only people who mention it are the sort of people who are already so far away from any rational , mainstream acceptance that they do n't really have to worry about the inevitable character assassination and liberal witch hunting that occurs when you do such a thing . 
  ( and those are n't the sort of people any right minded rational citizen will vote for ) . 
  but you ca n't oppose non-european immigration ( which is what is actually generating anti-immigrant sentiment in britain ) because that would be ` racist ' . 
  our society is so cowardly they target the sort of immigrants that we should want because they are n't ` allowed ' to dislike immigrants from non-european countries . 
  another reason i ca n't stand ukip is their willingness to ` take on ' eu immigration but at the same time collectively stick their tongue up the arse of the commonwealth as if it 's brought us anywhere near the quality of people europe has . 
  edit : for the record i support limiting eu immigration in principle , or at least having the power to do so , but not at the expensive of having to make up the difference with third-world and commonwealth immigrants . 
  you had to trawl through months of my posts to try and find something to put in a response ? 
  you seem a bit desperate . 
  also i do n't see what any of those posts have to do with turkey 's downward spiral .

  that 's handy because europe does n't like modern turkey . 
  they 're swiftly becoming like virtually every other islamist run shit hole . 
  disclaimer : this comment is in no way aimed at the entirety of the turkish people . 
  i 'm sure many of you , especially those on mainly english speaking sites like reddit are very nice . 
  but your government is shit and really doing you a disservice and i dread to think that people like erdogan really represent over half of your electorate . 
  boycott produce from an entire nation over 1 incident at 1 farm ? 
  that seems a bit irrational . 
  can anyone translate what they are chanting ? 
  as someone generally anti-communist it 's one of the few left wing ideologies i do tend to have a particular respect for , if only because in the context of the kurds they do n't see their ideology as incompatible with ideas of cultural , ethnic and national identity like most leftists do or want to impose these ideals on anyone else . 
  it is a part of russia . 
  see if we are talking about changing the format then i agree with you . 
  otherwise , the way it 's currently done , the greens do n't really have much clout in comparison to the other 4 and would be a waste of space , especially within the constraints that exist in their current format . 
  it 's bad enough with the three stooges . 
  now you 'll have ukip causing a ruck and the greens fetching for air trying to not argue with the rest of them . 
  the tv debate malarkey is bad enough without the addition of more people to try and fit into it . 
  the last poll on the issue put the anti eu crowd a mere 3 % smaller . 
  scotland is also full of these ` wankshafts ' you so despise . 
  that 's fine and i suppose in principle i agree . 
  but what 's to stop that system being abused by the plethora of ` small parties ' we have . 
  it 's incredibly easy to register as a political party in the uk . 
  despite my arguments i absolutely agree with you that they deserve some sort of representation in some forms of public debate . 
  however the lib dems , despite their wipe out in europe are still a party of government . 
  when the greens are on equal footing with the other 4 it will make sense for them to share a platform . 
  at the moment they 're simply not in the same league . 
  maybe when they generate the same buzz and support as ukip they 'll get the chance to . 
  that 's wishful thinking . 
  the reality is you ca n't let anyone with a small following onto the national stage to debate . 
  time is already stretched with the addition of ukip . 
  also where does it end ? 
  what should be the cut off limit for taking part in these debates ? 
  given recent immigration trends i 'm willing to bet most europeans would be more than welcoming to east asian immigrants compared to immigrants from many other parts of the world . 
  personally i think the east asian population should be encouraged to move to europe far more than any other non-european peoples . 
  their cultures tend to have a strong work ethic , they assimilate particularly well and strong links with that part of the world will be a massive benefit to european nations . 
  when they effectively demonstrate their support had risen substantially in a national election then they will have a point . 
  defend ukraine by surrendering sovereignty to america and the eu ? 
  russian attitudes towards ukraine are inexcusable . 
  but the senseless embrace of american and eu nation-wreckers is just as bad . 
  totally unbiased , believable source ... 
   during his career , jean-marie le pen , her father and founder of the national front , received words of encouragement from liberal democratic party of russia ( ldpr ) leader vladimir zhirinovsky . 
  marine le pen is aiming higher : she recently met with state duma speaker sergei naryshkin and deputy prime minister dmitri rogozin , and gave a speech to students at the diplomatic school of the russian foreign ministry . 
  i 'm pretty sure it was rogozin she met with and was invited by . 
  if was yankee money that funded the pseudo revolution in kiev and caused the ukrainian situation . 
  america is a nation wrecking monstrosity . 
  the world should collectively isolate that vile country . 
  america should mind it 's own business . 
  all they do is meddle and all they ever do is make things worse . 
  what the fuck has it got to do with you anyway ? 
  it 's not your country getting told it has to pay billions to a bunch of scheming foreign bureaucrats . 
  opus dei do n't justify fascism . 
  they justify hard work and being compassionate and charitable . 
  these are well organized , well funded smear campaigns particularly popular among spanish leftists and their fellow travelers who are still pissed off their anti-catholic genocidal republic died the swift death it deserved . 
  the fact that so many of opus dei go on to become successful individuals in their own right speaks worlds about the character of the sort of individuals the organisation attracts . 
  as opposed to the red rabble who make careers out of attacking devout people and imposing immorality . 
   religious group that encourages the participation of religious people in society and encourages hard work slandered by atheist media . 
  very few people in the uk will have anything bad to say about portuguese and spanish people working here specifically . 
  mainly because outside of the capital there are very few spaniards and portuguese . 
  the british ` right wing ' is useless , fractured and awash with neo-liberal american ` libertarian ' ideas . 
  it 's pathetic . 
  there 's no common ideology , no common strategy , no international affiliation and very little sense . 
  ukip are the worst example of that . 
  they 're a populist party in a country where the people do n't know what they want and they accurately reflect that . 
  one day they 're libertarians ( not too much though , because people do n't really like that stuff ) , the next day they 're old right conservatives of yesteryear who were forced to the fringes of the conservative party in thatcher 's later years ( but the conservatives are n't popular at the moment so they better not try and take up that cause ) . 
  they pander to nationalists who in other circumstances would be quite at home in a party like the bnp ( though not necessarily supporting their more idiotic policies ) , but are adamant to identify themselves as such . 
  they have no issue railing against immigration , though they 're all to careful to point out that they love immigrants as long as they 're not european christians . 
  it 's a shame . 
  mainland europe is spoiled for choice when it comes to politics . 
  in britain our only choices are social-democratic parties with no substance or a banal populist party in the form of ukip that has no policies or ideology to it 's name other than a broad opposition to the eu . 
  you lot ? 
  i 'd prefer a decent patriotic party like the fn ( who are not ` neo-fascist ' by any sensible measure ) than the wishy washy crap that ukip spew at the moment . 
  at least then they might actually have a coherent message instead of being a carbon copy of the american ` conservative ' movement .
