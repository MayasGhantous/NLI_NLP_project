  apparently that 's the same for us . 
  but you 've said you wo n't let us join your club if we leave the eu so we 're pretty fucked . 
  i think russia 's scared of finland , [ and for good reason . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ), 
  i know how to piss off a macedonian if that helps ? 
  i knew a lithuanian once . 
  nice guy . 
  he said i was the best drinker he 'd met in england . 
  i also learned that our double shots are singles in lithuania . 
  like denmark ? 
  i imagine that aberdeen is mostly used for shipping rig equipment out into the north sea . 
  i 'm sure that there will be ships that come and go between aberdeen and the continent , but most goods will come through an english seaport or airport , or through the channel tunnel , and will then be transported by road up to scotland . 
  much like the crimean referendum ? 
  now i 'm not saying they 're at all similar -- everyone knows that russia was pulling the strings -- but how would the international community be able to justify opposing the unofficial crimean referendum * because it 's unofficial * , but support a hypothetical , unofficial scottish referendum ? 
  i did n't know scotland made fudge . 
  is that that kid who has a learning difficulty , who filmed himself dancing to a song in the street with some of the neighbough kids ? 
  i think it was a maroon 5 song . 
   in her own words `` we have to temporarily accept reality '' . 
  that 's the scariest bit . 
  she 's quite happy to reject reality the rest of the time ? 
   like opposing investment in safer nuclear plants i do n't have much of a problem with that . 
  while i 'm pro-nuclear , i understand the point of view of people who are anti-nuclear . 
  edit : what are the tides like around sweden ? 
  a company in scotland recently made a breakthrough in using tidal power . 
  are the tides around sweden powerful enough to make the use of tidal-power economically feasible ? 
  edit 2 : the other stuff you mentioned makes her sound batshit crazy though . 
  i wan na see him take on boris johnson . 
  the kid versus the big kid . 
  it 'll be awesome . 
  cool . 
  different protest . 
  what 's wrong with \u00c5sa romson ? 
  according to wikipedia she 's your minister for the environment and the only thing she 's done wrong is use an illegal paint on the bottom of her boat . 
   i 'd have expected better than tabloid sensationalism from the guardian thank god you followed through with your thought instead of stopping there . 
  it 's not misleading . 
  / u/skypl was comparing the number of deaths at the hands of us law enforcement officers with the number of deaths at the hands of uk law enforcement officers . 
  you 're trying to compare the number of deaths at hands of one country 's law enforcement officers to another country 's law enforcement officers * and military personnel * . 
  you 're being disingenuous . 
   bame deaths in police custody how did they die ? 
   or otherwise following contact with the police that 's a bit broad . 
  how long is `` following '' and what type of `` contact with the police '' are we talking about ? 
  are they really that unhealthy ? 
  looking at [ this ] ( http://www.hillmanwonders.com/peasant_dishes/yalanci_dolma_recipe.htm ) recipe they do n't seem that bad . 
  onions , raisins , rice , nuts and leaf , with some olive oil and seasoning thrown in . 
  i 'm sure there was a case in the bosnian war whereby some un peacekeepers where unable to intervene while a war crime was being committed within sight of their base , because they themselves had not come under attack . 
  but that may be a myth . 
  i feel like it has something to do with canada or australia , but for the life of me i ca n't remember . 
  like i said it may not be true , but i definitely heard something along those lines years ago . 
  not really . 
  football and soccer are the same thing . 
  and portugal are not the world champions , germany are . 
  if you 're talking about talking about the olympics , [ mexico won the 2012 olympic 's football ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/football_at_the_2012_summer_olympics ) . 
  and if you 're talking about american football then [ the usa are the champions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ifaf_world_championship ) . 
  they 're only the european champions , not the world champions . 
  on the balance of play for the whole tournament , portugal do not deserve to win . 
  on the balance of play today , they definitely do . 
  portugal were better than france , no question . 
  so then to my mind , / u/fosian 's wondering how long rajoy will remain pm is a moot point in the context of catalonian/basque independence , as whomever replaces him will hold the same view regarding catalonian/basque independence . 
  as / u/fosian pointed out though , rajoy 's view could be taken out of context as he , presumably , is not opposed to holding a referendum on catalonian/basque independence as long as the whole of spain agrees . 
  so it 's perhaps not unreasonable to assume that whomever replaces him will hold the same/a similar viewpoint . 
  edit : also , thanks , that was very informative . 
   to be clear i was n't talking about a specifically basque or catalonian person being elected pm , just someone who has very clearly stated that one or both of those regions should become independent countries . 
  sorry , i was n't referring to your current pm specifically . 
  what i meant was what are the chances of an ardent and outspoken catalonian -- and/or basque -- separatist being elected pm ? 
  what does pp stand for ? 
  i forgot about them . 
  is it ` bask ' or ` basque ' ? 
   edit : i 'm represented in the eu parliament by 15 emps ... at least i can pick and chose . 
  did you mean to write ` meps ' ? 
  'cause all i 've got in my head is the image of you being represented by a whopping great missile . 
  i ca n't imagine any spanish pm saying anything different , unless they were an ardent and outspoken catalonian separatist . 
  and what are the chances of such a person being elected pm ? 
  sorry , do you mean spain would prevent unilateral or bilateral separation by blocking an independent scotland from the eu ? 
  why did n't he put rashford on 15-20 minutes sooner ? 
  as soon as he came on he put a smidgen of spark in to us . 
  it was just too little , too late . 
  what a knob . 
  england lost . 
  why are you surprised ? 
  me too . 
  i wish them luck against france . 
  i certainly would n't count them out . 
   they 've been awful tonight and thoroughly deserved to lose . 
  hats off to iceland , though . 
  they 're a limited team , but played to their own strengths and thoroughly deserved their win . 
  sums it up perfectly . 
  what 's the cut-off point ? 
  too bad , this is the internet . 
  actually he did study modern history at oxford university . 
  sources : * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al_murray * https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/about-college/comedy-writers, 
  [ try this one . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ioo-xq_vew ) you 'll need to know a little british political history to know some of the events he 's referencing . 
  it 's the same with any country of course . 
  if you want to be pedantic then / u/hellflame should also have said ` were ' , not ` was ' . 
  i am not saying that junker was not democratically elected . 
  i am saying the the prime minister of the uk is elected in a more democratic way than the president of the european council . 
  i therefore consider cameron to be ` more elected ' than junker . 
   cameron was directly elected by his constituents to represent his constituency , and then indirectly elected by the rest of the electorate . 
  we know who our prospective prime minister will potentially be when we vote , as the prime minister is , by convention , the leader of the party that wins the most seats at the general election . 
  so us triggering article 50 now is to your advantage , is that what you 're saying ?
