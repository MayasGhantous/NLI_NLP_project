  and it will cost may her job . 
  the only downside to may losing her job is the fact that davis is a look in for replacing her . 
  and if that happens we are well and truly fucked . 
   the uk and denmark for taking every single opt-out they can . 
  wait , it 's not just us ? 
  where can i find my new best friends , the danes ? 
  also correct me if i 'm wrong , but i think spain 's government is quite unstable at the moment ( i think i 've seen it in the news a few times over the past year or so ) . 
  although i do n't know if this is a one-off , whereas i know italy has had a long-term problem with unstable governments . 
  as to your other point , spain has something like 25 % youth unemployment . 
  you have a strong industrial base do n't you ? 
  i know we ( the company i work for ) buy the majority of our bespoke forgings from italy . 
  we also buy from spain , but they 're mostly from italy . 
  ironically , despite their reputation as an industrial powerhouse and net exporter , we hardly ever buy from germany because they 're too expensive . 
  i think we 've only bought one thing from germany since i 've been there ( four years at the beginning of september ) . 
  personally [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lvfscy8.png ) is the one that is most recognisable to me . 
  all i was thinking was , `` this is just a photo of erdogan sitting alone , am i missing something here ? '', 
  so people are looking at this and going , `` hurr durr , no-one wants to talk to him . '', 
  what the hell , how do you draw that conclusion ? 
  honestly , people will read something into anything if it suits their purposes . 
  does ` scourge ' mean ` whip ' then ? 
  did he get the epithet `` the hammer '' because he wielded a warhammer in battle , or is he depicted here wielding one * because * his epithet is `` the hammer '' ? 
  martel means hammer ? 
  my bulgarian friend was very happy to tell me about the bulgarian khanate and how it managed to repel a major muslim advance into eastern europe . 
  i think she 's a chemist , not a physicist . 
  did they go down in real terms or per capita ? 
  but china is still a single country , with a population of over one billion , most of whom speak mandarin i think . 
  even when the whole content of africa overtakes china in population terms , language wise it 'll still be split primarily between english and french , with a few other languages thrown in for good measure . 
  and even if you include canada , again they 're split between english and french . 
  * my balls . 
  i like the palace of westminster . 
  i do n't like the people who sit there but i like the palace . 
  i 'm 29 and books are almost always better than their films . 
  only by convention . 
  there 's no law or constitutional statute that says they have that right . 
  you mean the eu , not europe . 
  oh for fucks sake , we 're leaving the eu not europe . 
  when she says `` we europeans '' what she really means is members of the eu . 
  because the uk may be leaving the eu , but that does n't suddenly mean we 're not european . 
  if that were the case then albania , andorra , belarus , bosnia and herzegovina , iceland , liechtenstein , macedonia , moldova , monaco , montenegro , norway , san marino , serbia , switzerland and the ukraine are not european either . 
  oh and do n't forget parts of russia and turkey . 
  what , so because my fellow countrymen voted that we should leave the eu , i 'm no longer european ? 
  well thanks for the memo merkel and fuck you . 
  clever . 
  ~ ~ i do n't get the joke . ~ ~ sorry , now i do . 
  i do n't disagree with him but i think now is * entirely * the wrong time to be having this discussion . 
  if she would just get rid of david davis i would be * a lot * happier . 
  i do n't think they are . 
  i just disagree with their views . 
  i believe that ( officially ) taking a tough stance against russia 's aggressive actions in the ukraine and the middle east while simultaneously wanting to de-escalate tentions between the us and russia , is what qualifies him for a neutral rating . 
  personally i agree with you , i think he 's putin 's stooge . 
  i 'm just making a case for him receiving a neutral rating in the context of the ranking system used in / u/rinasciment 's submission . 
  ah sorry , i get it now . 
  your use of dots instead of commas confused me , because in english we use commas to seperate million , thousands and hundreds , not dots i.e. 
  we would write it 1,000,001 , not 1.000.001 . 
   but we are on an english speaking forum right now . 
  i would argue that that is not true . 
  it may be that reddit is a company who 's headquarters and server are based in the us , an english speaking country . 
  but this particular subreddit is dedicated to all of europe . 
  while the majority language is certainly english , there is no rule that states that commenters * must * write in english . 
  the fact that english is the de facto language used is more by convention . 
  in fact the only rule regarding language is in relation to submissions , not comments :  [ 3 . 
  paywalled and non-english submissions : allowed so long as the complete content of the article ( in english ) is posted in the comment section . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) personally i do n't agree with this rule , despite only speaking english myself . 
  edit : added an apostrophe to `` who 's '' . 
  maybe it depends on your language . 
  it could be that the dutch spell it switserland . 
  * shrugs *, 
  wait , really ? 
  so the next time i go to an eu country from the uk it is ok for me to leave my passport at home as long as i have my uk driving licence on me ? 
  i do n't get it ; would you mind explaining ? 
  i 'm assuming you 're making a joke based on the emojis / u/zepinda used . 
  sahkalin and the kuril islands are different though . 
  i do n't think they are ( currently ) in a dispute with russia vis-\u00e0-vis sakhalin , but they are in a dispute with them over the kuril islands . 
  he has ( officially ) taken a firm stance against russia vis-\u00e0-vis the ukraine though . 
  / u/posdeam : `` we ** are ** quite an open society ... '' `` are '' . 
  as in now . 
  not history , now . 
  the dutch and the swedes are some of the most open and tolerant people out there . 
  shall we talk about their history ? 
  as the use of paratroops was increasing during the malaya confrontation in the 1950 's , a british colonel asked the leader of a platoon of gurkha if they would be prepared to jump from a c130 . 
  somewhat to the colonel 's surprise , the gurkha sergeant requested a day to talk it over with his men . 
  the next day , the gurkha duly reported that they would do it , but only over marshy ground with the aicraft flying at no more than 100ft . 
  `` but at a hundred feet the parachutes would n't work '' , the colonel explained . 
  the gurkha replied , `` parachutes ? 
  no-one mentioned parachutes ! '', 
  i think the people who commented on that are reading faaaarrr too much into it . 
  i guess may 's point is that there 's `` dire '' and then there 's `` oh shit , oh shit , oh fuckity-shit-shit ! '', 
  it 's just that she and i disagree on which is which , [ bad ] deal or no deal . 
  i thought that the budget had been agreed , and that the mid-term review that was blocked a few weeks ago was about making changes to the distribution of the budget i.e. 
  how much of the pot does a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h , i , j , k , l , m , n , o , p , q , r , s , t , u , v , w , x , y , and z get ? 
  i like context . 
  when i type `` taks '' on it 's own into google translate it gives me `` dachsund '' and `` complement '' as translations . 
  : / i was really confused ( `` dachsund '' included ? 
  `` complement '' included ? ), 
  until i put `` taks inbegrepen '' in together . 
  then it finally translated `` taks '' as `` tax '' . 
  i dunno what to tell you mate , it seems we 've done a very good job of turning our royal family into a tourist attraction . 
  i dunno about the royalty , but a lot of people go to see buckingham palace and the colestream guards . 
  maybe they do hope to catch a glimpse of the royal family .
