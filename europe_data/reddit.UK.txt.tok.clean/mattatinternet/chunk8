  i mean i 'm english ; i 'm struggling to think of someone we * have n't * been colossal dicks to . 
  i do not watch the show and i do n't think i ever have . 
  soooo ... was he a good president or ... ? 
  what a fucking shock . 
  fucking intelligence community . 
  not content with eroding our civil liberties , they then go and put us all at risk by being incompetent . 
  to mark your ballot in a way other than with a mark next to your chosen candidate . 
  for instance you might simply strike a line through the entire ballot paper ; you might cross out all of the names and underneath them write `` none of the above '' ; you might doodle on it or write profanities on it , really , the possibilities are endless . 
  he 's quite charismatic actually , i think . 
  kind of like a kindly grandfather . 
  he 's just not realistic . 
  i respect the man for standing up for his principles , and there is a lot of what he says that i believe in , although plenty that i do n't . 
  but he does n't have the influence or the pragmatism to get any of it done . 
  whether or not you feel he holds the government to account , which as leader of the opposition is a big part of his job , is dependant on your point of view . 
  i do n't think he does a brilliant job , but saying that he 's terrible is not true . 
  it 's just that he could do a lot better . 
  i personally agree that he receives an unfair amount of bad press , though i would n't got so far as to call it a smear campaign . 
  some of it 's his own doing , but there 's definitely a prejudice against him in the mainstream media . 
  the problem is that he 's good at making soundbites , just not very good when it comes to substance . 
  it 's alright saying that you 'll do all of these wonderful sounding things , but where 's the money coming from huh ? 
  overall i like him , a * lot * more than may , and while i think he would make a poor prime minister , and there are policies of his i do n't support , i 'd still prefer him to her . 
  i was really disappointed in may . 
  she keeps harping on about `` strong and stable leadership '' now , and it 's getting tiresome . 
  but when she took over , although i did n't like her for her stance on privacy ( she 'd happily give the state a blank cheque to go snooping through all of our most private information ) i thought that she actually would be a strong leader . 
  but the past 10 months have proven otherwise . 
  she wants to be thatcher but she does n't have the brains and she does n't have the political savviness .

  what do you know about corbyn ? 
  i 'm not intending to be confrontational , it 's just odd to see a croat mention corbyn . 
  why not spoil your ballot ? 
  i know the election is over now and macron 's won , but spoiling your ballot is a legitimate way of affecting voting statistics . 
  i 've told my younger brothers that they 've got to go to the polling booth on june 8th . 
  they can spoil their ballot if they want , but at least go . 
   the uk consumes more cocaine per head than anywhere else wait , what ? 
  i agree . 
  but we have some people who 're burying their heads in the sand and pretending that the situation as been `` mostly resolved '' . 
  it has n't , not by a long shot . 
  it 's a joke right ? 
  all deporting them back to turkey is doing is putting a plaster on a severed femoral artery . 
  erdo\u011fan is keeping up his end of the deal and holding back the horde * for now * , because it still remains in his political interests to do so . 
  and honestly , who here actually * likes * the man ? 
  we need a long-term , substantive solution to the problem , and just deporting them back to turkey and hoping erdo\u011fan keeps them there is n't it . 
  what are `` layers '' ? 
   a poll on friday showed french voters to be among the most polarized in the european union , with one in five describing themselves as `` extreme '' and only about a third as `` centrist '' . 
  which poll ? 
  which wing of extremism and which side of centrist ? 
  that sounds reasonable to me . 
  that article only states that the us can not negotiate a trade agreement with individual members of the ** eu ** , only with the bloc as a whole . 
  it does not mention whether or not the us can negotiate a trade agreement with switzerland or members of the eea . 
  / u/statustxt quoted the following the other day :  the treaty on the functioning of the european union ( tfeu ) confers exclusive competence on external trade and foreign direct investment matters ( common commercial policy , known as `` ccp '' ) to the european union . 
  article 3 ( 1 ) ( e ) of the tfeu expressly stipulates that the ccp falls within the exclusive competence of the eu . 
  the purpose of this provision is to prevent member states from jeopardising the eu 's trade policy . 
  is it that part of that particular treaty that prohibits member states for negoatiating their own trade deals ? 
  if so then surely it is limited to eu member states only . 
  the very title makes reference to the eu only . 
  what 's the french cognate of luke ? 
  and has anyone checked to see if james earl jones is available ? 
  also , is cognate the correct word to use ? 
   i eat living duck 's liver with my bare teeth you do ? 
  there is a big difference between a leak and an official publication . 
  i do n't like juncker but at lease he 's not living in cloud cuckoo land . 
  may on the other hand ... 
  ah , my apologies , i see now what you were saying . 
  i read it differently . 
  the points i raised are now moot . 
  again , i apologise . 
  i honestly could n't care less whether the negotiations take place in english , french or german , but how is english less relevant than french or german when discussing britain , an english-speaking country , leaving the eu ? 
  all three languages are equally relevant in this negotiation . 
  but / u/batard-sensible was talking about theresa may . 
   in other words , ** she ** wants a fta or else they 'll go for `` no-deal '' . 
  the negociations might end before they even start . 
  this is the best show the uk ever produced . 
      maybe the eu should just stall the whole thing untill ** she ** comes back on earth and focus on more important matters , like borders controls with the european task force , eu 's relation with ankara or unemployment in some countries . 
  `` she '' is clearly a reference to theresa may . 
  in your sentence yes , ** focus ** . 
  but in the sentence / u/batard-sensible wrote it should be focus ** es ** . 
  they could have said `` maybe the eu should just stall the whole thing until she comes back down to earth ** and realises that she needs to ** focus on more important matters '' , that would have been correct . 
  but in the sentence they used they need to say focus ** es ** because it is may who is doing the focusing . 
  i do n't speak french . 
  what does ` bis ' mean ? 
  according to google translate it means ` to ' , but based on the context in which you used it i would have guessed that it means ` bitch ' . 
  the word ` that ' is optional in your sentence . 
  it makes no difference and no-one would notice whether you said it or not . 
  and it 's not like i 'm in a position to criticise as i do n't speak french . 
  edit : changed ` since ' to ` as ' . 
  i do n't mean to be a dick but you 've missed a word . 
  you should have said `` i ** was ** mistaken '' . 
  sorry , can i add two more things ? 
   i did like it , even though i did n't understood everything that should be ` understand ' . 
  you did n't ` understand ' everything . 
   denholm reynholm in the it crowd is one of my favorite character ever that should be ` characters ' . 
  you should make it plural in this context . 
   maybe the eu should just stall the whole thing untill she comes back ** to ** earth and focus ** es ** on more important matters ftfy i do n't intend to be a dick , just trying to help out . 
  my apologies if i offended you . 
  how common is it to refer to us ( the uk , not just england ) as ` albion ' ? 
   chris morris is a ( an ? ), 
  hilarious chap it 's difficult . 
  on the face of it you should say ` a ' because the word ` hilarious ' starts with a ` h ' , which is a consonant , not a vowel . 
  the general rule is that words that start with a consonant should be prefaced with ` a ' and words that start with a vowel should be prefaced with ` an ' .
