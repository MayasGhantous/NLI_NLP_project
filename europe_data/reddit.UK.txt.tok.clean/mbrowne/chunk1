in some cases , lower incomes give more to the economy : there are more of them , and also their income is almost entirely spent , rather than saved , which makes it subject to the multiplier effect . 
  on the other hand , the rich are able to use lots of ways to hide their money , and so `` remove '' it from the economy . 
   the point of what i 'm saying is that the jobs with less income require less working hours or effort . 
  it would appear that you have no actual experience of work at all . 
  many low paid jobs require more effort , not less . 
  i am relatively well off , and i do not think that i put in a lot of effort . 
  the blokes who built the extension to my house worked bloody hard , did a fantastic job , and earn a lot less than i do . 
  not only that , but if my work goes wrong no-one dies , but if they do sloppy work people can be killed . 
  the graph is not commenting on how much can be bought with each euro in each country , but only on how much an employer has to spend so that an employee has one euro after all taxes . 
  it is useful for those of us who are not from ex-jugoslavija to have signs that we can easily read . 
  i can read cyrillic , but only slowly , which is not good when driving . 
  twenty years ago , but that should be long enough to start to heal . 
  on the other hand , i agree that there is no need for the signs , because everyone can read latin . 
  there is no need , but there is a want , and so it should happen . 
  they can believe whatever they want . 
  what they can not do is behave in a way that does not fit in with the laws of where they live . 
   which king is that ? 
  and yet there is the current rise of ukip , who strike me as inherently somewhat racist in outlook . 
  edit : several comments here saying that i am incorrect , and on reflection i probably am . 
  however , it is definitely the case that ukip are * seen * as a racist party . 
  berlin is one of my favourite european cities . 
  i also like washington , but i 've never been to new york , so ca n't compare . 
  i agree that the uk would still exist - i used `` ex-uk '' to imply all of the current parts . 
  the point of north sea income being finite is that the uk has a larger economy than just scotland , so could weather the loss more easily . 
  as i said , my reasons for not wanting scotland to leave are mostly emotional , and i think that is true for many , including scots ( or either opinion ) . 
  we pick the facts that suit out prejudice . 
  i do n't think there is a massive logical reason to either leave or stay . 
  as i said , others think differently . 
  i think that the ex-uk as a whole would be less well off , not just a separate scotland . 
  also , specifically for scotland , quite a lot of their income would come from the north sea , and it is likely that this will diminish in the short to medium term . 
  and , to be fair , i am emotionally attached to the uk - i self-identify as british , then english , rather than the other way around . 
  i agree . 
  from a `` use of english '' perspective , that is nationalist , as in `` i want my home to be a separate nation '' . 
  although the word `` nationalist '' has become pejorative , it is a useful descriptive , and should n't be discarded . 
   i could tell you that it all sounds so rosy that one wonders why the scottish want to secede . 
  because different people have different views as to what is `` rosy '' . 
  i think that it will make scotland much poorer to leave the uk , but there are other , both scots and english , who think the opposite . 
  i assume there is the same separation of view in catalonia . 
  serious question - how is that different from being a nationalist ? 
  as an outsider , it looks the same to me . 
  edit : added question mark . 
  of course not , hence the quote marks . 
  however , europe has been generally good for the uk , and vice versa . 
  some of us have a few problems with the eu , but certainly prefer it to the alternative - we would not do well `` on our own '' . 
  although when we visited there a couple of years ago there did seem to be some movement towards italy - even discussion of some kind of union , although that seemed unlikely . 
  my serbian wife still thinks of herself as yugoslav . 
  she moved to the uk before the breakup , so she did not live through it , although we visit regularly . 
  i would say that german re-unification is irrelevant , as there was only one country at the end of it . 
  as for russia - actually that would support the position that scotland would not be part of the eu , as the rest of the ussr did not inherit their positions from the ussr - e.g. 
  only russia got a seat on the un security council . 
  scotland and england are equal partners , but the union is more than just the two . 
  if the union is to be dissolved , i want a vote , too . 
  if not , then it is just scotland leaving , and the uk will still exist . 
  to be perfectly honest , i am emotionally attached to the union , including scotland , and would not like to see scotland leave . 
  however , if they do , i think they should be part of the eu . 
  the problem is that it sets off legal precedents for other countries ( spain , greece , possibly others ) , even if the separatists there are not currently separate countries . 
  i ca n't see how scotland `` is a distinct country ** in the ec ** '' . 
  it is a distinct country , but it is part of the eu as part of the uk . 
  in which case your first statement does n't actually support the thought that countries are people . 
  somewhat pointless , then . 
  that is in the past , and is not true any longer . 
  the monarch is the head of state , and may represent the country , but is not the equivalent of the country . 
  do you have any modern international law that would support your position ? 
  that would be fine , but i think america was wrong , and so do many others . 
  do you have a citation for that ? 
  i do n't believe it to be true , but i am perfectly happy to be corrected . 
  as far as i know , not many countries gives the rights of a person to companies . 
  the american supreme court decision is unfortunate , and certainly should not bind any other country . 
  i know he said that , but it does n't make it true . 
  it is complete crap . 
  my comment was only referring to the rules of the nobel committee . 
  i have no problem with a group winning the prize . 
  you missed off the bit before that : '' ... and one part to the ** person ** who shall have done ... '' . 
  the eu is not a person . 
  she could technically refuse to give the royal assent . 
  however , that has n't happened since queen anne , so if the queen did so now there would be a constitutional fuss . 
  i imagine we 'd be a republic fairly quickly . 
  while i disagree with the thrust of metailurus 's argument , there is one thing in the uk that gay people can do that is denied to straight people - they can have a civil partnership . 
  when gay marriage was legalised , civil partnerships should have been removed as an option . 
  so why does that not apply to scotland ? 
  i must be an edge case . 
  it 's over 25 years since i was a twenty-something . 
  thanks . 
  probably not , but someone called `` wasp poker '' almost certainly is . 
  so far , so good . 
  we celebrate 29 years this july , 
  absolutely . 
  so hot that i married one . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i do n't care what they are , but it makes me more comfortable to see faces . 
  also , as someone who is somewhat hearing-impaired , i use lipreading to help . 
  that is not possible if the face is covered . 
  did you miss his second sentence , where he basically said that the previous line was a joke ? 
  as i have grown older , my politics has moved to the left , especially in the last 20 years . 
  for reference , i am in my mid-fifties . 
  sadly , my nearly-eighty-year-old mother seems to move further right each year . 
  well that 's pretty pointless . 
  i tend to carry very little cash , because i have my credit cards . 
  why would i make an exception just to tip ? 
  lots of us who voted to stay have accepted that leaving can not be shipped .
