  despite our friendly rivalry with the french , i 'd much rather have them across the channel than stalin . 
   espoused liberalism but made himself a military dictator  responsible for wars that caused about 5 million deaths sounds great to me . 
  edit : i do n't know as much as i think i do about napoleon . 
  his name is actually mark ivan rogers . 
  i assume he uses his middle name because he prefers it . 
  according to [ this source ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/08/05/russia-putin-held-in-low-regard-around-the-world/ ) , british views of russia are 18 % favourable and 66 % unfavourable . 
  those figures are very similar to other western countries . 
  we also have [ more favourable ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/06/support-for-nato-is-widespread-among-member-nations/ ) views of nato than most other members . 
  just because a narrow majority voted for brexit does n't mean we 're a country of authoritarian nationalist nutcases . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lasagne ) disagrees . 
  shepherd 's pie , english breakfast , haggis , fish and chips , cornish pasty , yorkshire pudding , lancashire hotpot i 'll take our food any day , thanks . 
  thanks for wishing that my life becomes worse just because a bunch of other people on this island voted for something !, 
  you 're the best !, 
  le pen ? 
  we were ww2 bros , in that we hosted the czech government-in-exile . 
  there were also a bunch of raf squadrons made up of czech pilots who had fled from the nazis . 
  i guess it 's similar to our ties to poland . 
  i think it was new zealand that had a flag referendum . 
  other than that i completely agree . 
   strikes : every fucking day france in a nutshell really . 
  not that we british can talk with our current railway situation . 
  just like when britain colonised canada , india , australia and half of africa and created the british federation . 
  it was the largest federation the world had ever seen . 
  i disagree . 
  there are distinct generational trends in support for the eu , and in this instance i do n't think it 's a case of people becoming more eurosceptic as they get older - rather , people who were born later are more likely to support the eu . 
  if the referendum were to be held again in five years ' time , i believe remain would win , purely due to demographics . 
  perfidious albion strikes again !, 
  the faroe islands are n't on this map . 
  you might be confusing them with the shetland islands , which are definitely part of the uk . 
  `` secretive '' in this instance meaning `` clueless '', 
  the british government still decides whether or not they 're going to fire them . 
  the usa 's influence could probably prevent us from a first strike , but i seriously doubt anyone in power here would be contemplating that anyway . 
  the only context in which the uk would fire nuclear missiles is if we were ourselves under nuclear attack , in which case it would be a snap decision made by the prime minister and the us would be unable to intervene . 
  compared to the rest of the uk , i think london has more very rich people but also more very poor people , as do other cities in general . 
  i would expect this to be replicated across the eu . 
   the wealthy and highly educated people of london the south-east , south-west and eastern england all have higher household wealth than london does ( the average figure for london is similar to that of the midlands ) . 
  london may be where a lot of the economic activity is - it has the city of london , as well as almost 9 million people - but it 's not like everyone in london is living the high life . 
  while wages are much higher in london , so is cost of living . 
  it evens it out a lot . 
  sarcasm means sarcasm . 
  shit . 
  and i 'm normally so good with sarcasm . 
   * technically * that 's not a technicality , that 's just a fact and it has been for 95 years . 
  yeah , that 's fair enough . 
  i feel bad defending ferguson to be honest , because many people ( including myself , to an extent ) think that he 's really a right-wing hack rather than a proper historian . 
  good point , had n't thought about it that way . 
  i have n't read the book ( and do n't intend to because i 'm not a fan of ferguson ) but to be completely fair , i think the point he was trying to make was that it was better than the alternatives . 
  you can make a vaguely reasonable argument that british colonisation was n't as bad as , for example , belgian colonisation . 
  no , it is n't . 
  i would n't trust them on anything to do with the eu , but they tend to be better on uk-specific issues . 
  only their european articles get posted on this sub , so everyone gets the worst possible impression of them . 
  it 's not the best paper , and certainly not my news source of choice , but it 's far from the worst and some of their writers are actually pretty good . 
  that 's not entirely fair on the telegraph . 
  they do produce some good articles , and they tend to be good when reporting on internal conservative party issues ( for fairly obvious reasons ) . 
  they 're far from my favourite news source , but they 're slightly misrepresented on r/europe because it seems that only their worst articles are posted here . 
  apparently ireland is part of the british isles , but the isle of man is n't ... 
  bear in mind that about 30 % of people in ukraine are russian-speaking . 
   ukraine  22 % wow , i wonder what makes them so suspicious of russia . 
  that depends on how you measure it . 
  in terms of overall civilian casualties , unionist paramilitaries killed more than republicans , but the british army killed far fewer than either . 
  according to [ this page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles#casualties ) :  of those killed by british security forces :  * 187 ( ~ 51.5 % ) were civilians  * 145 ( ~ 39.9 % ) were members of republican paramilitaries  * 18 ( ~ 4.9 % ) were members of loyalist paramilitaries  * 13 ( ~ 3.5 % ) were fellow members of the british security forces  of those killed by republican paramilitaries :  * 1080 ( ~ 52 % ) were members/former members of the british security forces  * 723 ( ~ 35 % ) were civilians  * 187 ( ~ 9 % ) were members of republican paramilitaries  * 57 ( ~ 2.7 % ) were members of loyalist paramilitaries  * 11 ( ~ 0.5 % ) were members of the irish security forces  of those killed by loyalist paramilitaries :  * 878 ( ~ 85.4 % ) were civilians  * 94 ( ~ 9 % ) were members of loyalist paramilitaries  * 41 ( ~ 4 % ) were members of republican paramilitaries  * 14 ( ~ 1 % ) were members of the british security forces republican paramilitaries did , however , have the lowest civilian casualty ratio . 
  i think it 's elizabeth ii , by the grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and of her other realms and territories queen , head of the commonwealth , defender of the faith , but i could be wrong . 
   you 're being obtuse no need for that . 
  you do n't seem to understand why the proportion of `` white british '' people , and the proportion of people who were born in the uk , are likely to be correlate very closely . 
  since you 're so insistent , though , [ this article ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13134590.number_of_immigrants_living_in_scotland_doubles_in_a_decade/ ) claims that 12 % of glasgow 's population are foreign-born , and [ this page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demography_of_england ) says that 13.84 % of england population are foreign-born . 
  are the uk and france actually different countries ? 
  we seem to be ridiculously close together in every `` look at these statistics '' post on this sub . 
  these are just the nordic council countries , are n't they ? 
   nigerians will often retain their sense of nationality identity multiple generations in for instance . 
  how on earth is that relevant ? 
  no matter what their national identity , nobody of nigerian ancestry is going to put themselves down as `` white british '' . 
   use the real thing is the census not the real thing ? 
  it does n't assume that immigrants are not white because white british is a separate ethnicity on uk censuses , and the proportion of white brits is what i 'm using . 
  i realise that , but i could n't find any statistics on country of birth in glasgow , so i choose a stat that 's likely to correlate quite closely . 
  that 's really quite low . 
  england is more ethnically diverse than glasgow . 
   six million dead is widely accepted by historians worldwide . 
  widely accepted as the number of jews killed by the holocaust , but the figure does n't include the other 5-6 million killed in nazi camps ( e.g. 
  socialists , homosexuals , roma , jehovah 's witnesses , to name a few ) . 
  i think the problem is that the word `` holocaust '' technically only refers to the genocide of jews , but a lot of people are unaware of that . 
  personal favourites : * departugal * czech-out * withdrawsaw * lithawaynia, 
   in fact , should n't the countries closest to actual potential threats ( the border countries , so to speak ) , pay and invest a lot more , simply because they are the most likely to need that pact ? 
  its like a insurance if you see it like that . 
  i do n't see it that way , personally , but i do n't think we 're going to resolve that disagreement , since it 's basically just a matter of principle . 
   i think thats fair , if you want to complain , you need to come up with good arguments for your complaint . 
  and right now the complaint is entirely `` you do n't spend enough '' without saying in what you actually feel is missing . 
  should germany advance its naval capacities because nato needs to match russian increased arming of the baltic fleet ? 
  what exactly do they want ? 
  this is one area where we can agree . 
  thanks for the source , by the way . 
  i would n't worry about it . 
  i think most people who even vaguely follow german politics know them as die linke . 
   why though ? 
  i mean , on what do you base this ? 
  what obligation , militarily , does germany need a large military to meet ? 
  the assumption that i 'm making is that nato is an alliance in which every country has the same obligations ( e.g. 
  mutual defence ) to every other country , and that as such every country should make roughly equal contributions to the collective defence forces of the bloc ( in proportion to gdp/population , of course ) . 
  assuming that you support nato membership for germany , what approach do you think would be better than assigning an arbitrary target ? 
  perhaps each country could be assigned a number of particular responsibilities , so germany would , for example , have to maintain a certain number of armoured units ready to deploy straight to eastern europe , and the uk would have to maintain enough asw ships and aircraft to cover the giuk gap . 
  that sounds like it would be hellishly complicated , though .
