   trying to break nuclear deal with iran and searching for a pretext to declare war on them even if we assume all of that is true , it 's not particularly relevant to europe . 
   supporting ksa which spreads wahhabism in europe individuals and organisations within saudi arabia do , but i 've yet to see any reliable evidence that the saudi government is spreading wahhabism . 
  in addition , many european countries support saudi arabia - not least france , who sold them [ over 2 billion euros ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/massive-eu-weapons-sales-to-saudi-arabia-contribute-to-fuelling-international-aggression-and-terrorism-in-the-middle-east/29881 ) worth of arms in 2010 . 
   waging war with iraq for no reason , which triggers terrorist attacks in europe that 's a gross oversimplification , and ignores a number of equally damaging interventions which european countries took part in willingly - most obviously , libya . 
   supporting rebels in syria most of whom are also supported by many european countries , like the uk , france and germany  the people behind the brexit campaign were rich americans private individuals who do n't represent their government . 
  the then-us president personally endorsed remain . 
   donald wants to trade with each european nation not with the eu as a whole donald ca n't do that , so it does n't matter . 
  besides , it 's becoming increasingly clear that what he wants and what becomes us policy can be wildly different . 
  in what way is the us an enemy of europe ? 
  the vast majority of eu members are also nato members , and therefore directly allied to the us . 
  you should also remember that the us has been a long-time champion of european unity , pushing for the creation of the european parliament and , more recently , trying to prevent the uk from leaving . 
  people always forget about the pacific in general , but when they do remember it , they think about the us island-hopping campaign . 
  far fewer people seem to know about the british/commonwealth campaigns in se asia or the dutch in the east indies - let alone the massive war effort on the part of the chinese . 
  or just america in general . 
  i do n't have a clue , although bangladesh seems to be the one with the least problems with radicals out of the four . 
  having googled it , apparently we did . 
  til . 
  largest battle in europe , i think . 
  i imagine there had been several larger ones in china . 
  we usually just call it `` the battle of leipzig '' , but that 's a bit boring . 
  ah yes , the famous battle of the nations * * ^ does ^ not ^ include ^ the ^ uk , ^ spain , ^ portugal , ^ switzerland , ^ denmark-norway , ^ bavaria , ^ hanover ^ or ^ the ^ ottoman ^ empire, 
  they 're from the economist originally . 
  you 'd have to ask them . 
  no problem !, 
  apologies for lack of sources , i was on mobile . 
  [ this article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_in_the_european_union_by_muslim_population ) contains the following passages :  the french capital of paris and its metropolitan area has the largest number ( up to 1.7 million according to the economist )  london also has a substantial community of muslim origin , numbering about 1 million within the limits of greater london and exceeding this figure when the entire metropolitan area is taken into account . 
  so it looks like the london figure may be a bit higher , but i do n't think the urban area will add another 700,000 - paris is still ahead . 
  as for relative levels of radicalisation , i have no idea how that would be measured , but off the top of my head i think british muslims tend to be slightly better-integrated than french ones . 
  i think that depends whether you 're counting paris proper or the urban area , which are very different . 
  if you include the urban areas of both , i think there are about 1 million muslims in london and about 1.7 million in paris . 
  they made it , we made it cool . 
  well no shit . 
  we 're economically and culturally closer to other european countries than we are to the rest of the world , with the exception of the other anglo countries . 
  the problem was that other eu countries completely lost control of their external borders , and still have n't fully regained control . 
  1 million people entered germany in a year ffs . 
  during the referendum , people would ask stuff like `` when they get german passports in a few years , will they be able to come here ? '', 
  - and the only answer we remainers could give to that was `` yes '' . 
  i do n't think this map fully shows [ the level of border gore ] ( http://vgsgermansig.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/deutscher_bund.png ) germany was capable of in this period . 
  of course , they 'd improved massively since [ the previous century ] ( http://www.euratlas.net/history/europe/rhein_oder/rhine_oder_1700.jpg ) . 
  over a century before the united kingdom existed ? 
   russia only 5 % behind the us lol, 
  not that i support cutting down the bia\u0142owie\u017ca , but i do n't think it 's the last primeval forest in europe . 
  i know of at least [ one other ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peru%c4%87ica ) . 
  but ... why ? 
  many people do that , but how many atheists say they 're christians on the census ? 
  it 's kinda surprising to see the big four anglos at one end and the big four euros at the other . 
  i 'd rather politicians were n't hiding their money or their mistresses , personally . 
  or how zambia , a landlocked and underdeveloped african country of 16 million people , has more brits than poland does . 
  or how bahrain , a tiny arab monarchy of just over 1 million people , has more brits than denmark . 
  it 's no wonder that people do n't care about eu freedom of movement . 
  yes , farage was a `` senior brexit person '' if you want to use that phrase , but what he says means nothing about the aims of the british government . 
  as for gove , fair enough , but i still do n't think that the government as a whole is aiming to break up the eu . 
  doing so is n't in the uk 's interests , and most cabinet members were remainers anyway . 
  the one that really surprised me was that there are more of us in south africa than in france . 
  such as ? 
  are any of these `` senior brexit people '' government ministers ? 
  i imagine you mean farage , who is n't a member of the government or the conservative party , and was n't even part of the official leave campaign . 
   this looks like the case because the snp have been so successful lately . 
   boy i bet they are pissed off la pen lost no , we 'd much rather negotiate with an eu that 's still sane than one that 's been thrown into chaos . 
   uk tried to dissolve eu by starting cascade of - exits yes , that 's obviously what we 're trying to do . 
  [ for reference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_diaspora ) , there are * 1,300,000 brits in australia * 678,000 brits in the united states * 603,000 brits in canada * 215,000 brits in new zealand * 212,000 brits in south africa, 
  i see we 've re-engaged with our favourite national hobby - only just beating the french . 
   so we 're already agreed that nato had nothing to do with the northern irish peace resolution yes , nato is completely irrelevant to this . 
   i do n't know the details of the cta , but did it give the right for any irish citizen to move their family up north and join the northern-irish civil service , and vice versa ? 
  i do n't know for sure , but i think so . 
  i do n't doubt that shared eu membership helped the peace process in northern ireland , but i do n't think the eu can be entirely credited with the principle of freedom of movement between the north and the republic , since both the uk and ireland displayed the political will to introduce it themselves . 
   is a form of historical revisionism you say that like it 's an inherently bad thing . 
  this is somewhat unrelated , but history is being revised all the time and for a good reason . 
  without historical revisionism we 'd still blame `` german aggression '' for ww1 . 
  exactly , so the troubles began and ended while freedom of movement between northern ireland and the republic was already in place . 
  eu freedom of movement therefore ca n't be credited as part of the peace process . 
  the headline is about committing troops , but that does n't seem to be mentioned in the body of the article . 
  most of it is about a future uk-australia fta and a general re-engagement with the asia-pacific region . 
  certainly not as big as other brands like coke , and not as big as it is in scotland , but it 's still fairly popular . 
  london , originally and currently , but i have n't always lived here . 
  oh yeah , i forgot lucozade exists . 
  it 's probably just because i 'm a bit of an irn-bru fan , so it 's the first thing i think of . 
  definitely scotland , but it 's also the first domestically-produced soft drink i think of for the uk . 
  the uk-roi common travel area predates eu freedom of movement by decades , so i do n't see how you can credit the eu with peace in ni . 
  irn-bru have two factories , one in lanarkshire and one in nottinghamshire , so i think it counts . 
  i know , but it means we 've got a reputation . 
  apparently having an extensive north sea coastline makes your country better in every single way . 
  i think it 's because we basically invented free trade . 
  i 'm not thrilled about the idea , but with turkey and moral considerations must be weighed against the prospect of granting russia permanent access to the mediterranean along with the ability to shut the west out of the black sea . 
  we should n't bow to all turkish demands , but keeping good relations with them is essential . 
  a large regional power that controls the gateway between the mediterranean and the black sea as well as the main land route between the middle east and europe ? 
  that sounds like a country that i would want as an ally . 
  and turkey . 
  firstly , i did n't post this article . 
  secondly , it 's about the whole of the uk , not just england . 
  thirdly , what continent do you think the uk is part of ? 
   / r/europe covers all european-related content, 
  no , she married king philip ii of spain . 
  it was her sister , elizabeth i , who never married . 
  in a discussion between a brit and a german about our historical relationships with poland , we both know who is gon na win . 
  [ good news !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overseas_france ), 
  that only happens very rarely though . 
  in my experience , everyday parliamentary debate is just as boring to watch in the uk as it is in most other countries . 
  it may be fractionally more theatrical because of the adversarial nature , but not by much .
