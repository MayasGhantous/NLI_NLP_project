  at first i thought `` fuck yeah , we get two '' and then i saw italy . 
  i 'm well aware of turkey 's geography , i 'm just taking the piss . 
  it 's a wealthy country and they all learn english as a second language . 
  i want some of whatever you 're smoking . 
   maybe uk wants to invade the western parts of europe . 
  why on earth would we want to do that ? 
   they did support russians in their quest for land in ww2 . 
  only out of necessity . 
  it was either that or tacitcly support the nazis in their quest for land . 
  aside from our alliances of convenience in the ww1 and ww2 , we 've been at russia 's throat ( and vice versa ) pretty consistently for at least 150 years . 
   literally called asia minor  people say it 's in europe . 
  okay . 
  in all seriousness i 'm only having a laugh , i know there 's dispute over whether or not turkey is european . 
   well if the french cared about their national duty you would n't have needed the ~ ~ british ~ ~ ~ ~ us ~ ~ soviets to get you out of that pickle with the germans . 
  twice . 
  bulgarians and macedonians too . 
  ^ trigger ^ warning ^ for ^ turkish ^ redditors, 
   physical pain . 
  emotional distress . 
  public embarassment . 
  regret that they wanted it . 
  unprepared because of arrogance . 
  die eventually . 
  you 're talking about brexiteers dying and * i 'm * the scary one ? 
  you 're wishing ruin upon me , my country and almost everyone i know . 
  you are being a cunt of the highest order . 
   have the right to brag that they were right `` i told you so '' . 
  yeah , that will make me feel * so * much better . 
  politics is n't a game and these are real peoples ' lives and livelihoods that you 're talking about . 
   in regards with the remainers , do n't worry because they already knew that brexit is bad and they already expected all the worst things possible , so it would n't be painful at all . 
  no , that 's not how it works . 
  just because you expect something to happen does n't mean it does n't hurt . 
  would you like it if i broke your legs but warned you first ? 
   uk in 28th place it is my civic duty to move us up in the rankings . 
  czech stronk ? 
  on a more sinister note , when i was in amsterdam i was told that every year at least 10 drunk try to piss in canals , fall in , and drown . 
  it sounds like it could be an urban legend , but it 's a bit chilling nonetheless . 
  that makes a lot more sense . 
  also , that is a properly fucking beautiful building . 
  is that on a canal ? 
  surely security must be a nightmare ? 
  with regards to the eurozone , i agree with you in that it should either be federalised or dismantled . 
  what i really meant was that having the uk in the eurozone would be like having a second germany ( i.e. 
  a large , highly-developed northern european country with a highly-valued currency before the euro was formed ) and would make the euro even more overvalued for southern europe . 
  greece , spain , portugal and italy would be in even worse situations today if the uk had joined .

  i 'd like to address some of your points :  not being in the eurozone , i think the last two decades have thoroughly vindicated our decision not to join . 
   saying repeatedly that the us is a more special ally than the rest of the eu this was probably always gon na be the case , in a `` de gaulle was right '' sense . 
  the uk has always been a fundamentally atlantic nation , in some ways more than it has been a european one . 
   blocking a further eu integration apologies . 
  as a soft eurosceptic ( one that voted remain , btw ) i quite liked our previous position , as it allowed us to hold back `` ever-closer union '' and still reap the economic benefits , but i can understand why this might piss off a lot of people . 
   refusing to at least trying to really learn another language than english no excuses there , really . 
  on a personal level i can speak a fair bit of german and can sort of get by in french , but collectively we 're pretty shit . 
  that being said , you 'd probably be just as bad if french had accidentally become the global lingua franca . 
  although i did n't want brexit , since i think the economic damage will be too great and i did n't want scottish nationalism to rear its head again , my hope is that we can move towards the churchillian model of cross-channel relations , with a `` united states of europe '' which sees the uk as a key partner and ally . 
  i 'd love to but unfortunately they 're all going back to the continent after brexit . 
  that 's what i 'm saying . 
  it has never been viewed in the same way over here . 
  i find it pretty weird seeing all these head of state/government offices where the national flag and the eu flag are both displayed together . 
  i ca n't imagine anyone doing that in the uk , even before the referendum . 
  sorry , i ca n't hear you over the sound of 1.5 billion people speaking english . 
  ^ i ^ get ^ what ^ you ^ mean ^ though edit : [ it 's only a joke . 
  why you heff to be mad ?

  but anglo standards are the best standards . 
  that 's fine by me so long as we 're not in it . 
  there are a number of issues with this site . 
  for one thing , it counts lhas , lhds and lphs as aircraft carriers , and for another , it makes no qualitative assessment of equipment or training , so 1,000 t-34s crewed by conscripts are worth more than 900 leopard 2a6s crewed by the best tankers in the world . 
  and that 's just two examples . 
  so , while it 's good fun , take it with a pinch of salt . 
  you 're right to an extent , but multiple us carriers , the admiral kuznetsov and the charles de gaulle have all been deployed to the mediterranean to carry out airstrikes against isis ( and against the syrian opposition , in russia 's case ) . 
  interesting point about the f-35b vs the rafale m. i 'd only ever compared the f-35b to the f-35c , and assumed that the rafale would have a similar range to the latter . 
  surely the cdg can fiddle around with its air wing to increase the number of fighters ? 
  how much difference is there between the effectiveness of fixed-wing vs helicopters in these roles ? 
  that 's correct , but from what i gather the queen elizabeth-class will have a faster long-term sortie rate than the cdg . 
  institutionally speaking , yes . 
  the uk , denmark , the netherlands and greece are the four countries that seem to me to be the most opposed to european integration across the board . 
  the visegrad 4 will bang on about immigration and kick up a fuss about refugees , but almost all of them support closer political , economic and military ties between the countries of the eu . 
  i personally find it surprising that france is more genetically diverse than the uk , given our history with britons , gaels , anglo-saxons and what have you . 
  i never asked about whether or not we can be relied on , and besides , that 's not a very good way of describing foreign policy because it does n't specify what we 're being `` relied on '' for . 
   you have been creating the eu as it is today and now you are exiting . 
  that is a major shift and scepticism about uk has firm foundations . 
  i 'm not denying that brexit is a big change . 
  i 'm denying that it means all co-operation with europe will end and that it represents a break with 100 years of foreign policy . 
  i would also ask what you specifically mean by `` scepticism '' . 
   many say you should n't have been trusted in the first place and that de gaulle was right . 
  again , that 's very non-specific . 
  `` trusted '' for what ? 
  brexit does n't mean we 're ending all co-operation with other european countries . 
  it certainly means we wo n't co-operate as much in as many areas , but we are n't cutting all ties . 
  many non-eu countries co-operate closely with the eu , such as ( but not limited to ) all the efta members , ukraine , turkey , canada and the us . 
  the eu has n't been central to our foreign policy for the last century , because it has n't existed for the last century . 
  it 's 44 years since we joined the eec , and it 's only existed in its modern sense since maastricht , which was 25 years ago . 
  in addition , `` co-operation with other european countries '' is not an accurate description of the last century of british foreign policy ( in my opinion virtually nothing can accurately describe it because it 's changed so much , but that 's another story ) . 
  100 years ago we were only a decade out of our ` splendid isolation ' period . 
  we were also at war with most of europe , which happened again 75 years ago , and we were geopolitical enemies of much of europe until the fall of the iron curtain . 
  plenty of people will still say it 's a power grab . 
  probably not enough to stop it , but this wo n't exactly be unopposed . 
  well that 's a bit of a cuntish thing to do .
