  i assume that 's where the joke comes from . 
  i remember seeing the exact same site a while ago . 
  perhaps they changed the web address ? 
  are n't these from several months ago now ? 
  that 's not an actual verse of the national anthem . 
  i 'm on mobile right now , but i 'll see if i can find a link later . 
  i think it was made up by some random guy during one of the jacobite rebellions and never officially adopted . 
  it depends what you count as `` radical right '' . 
  while many would count ukip as far-right , for example , they 're relatively moderate compared to fn , who in turn are nowhere near as extreme as golden dawn . 
  i actually quite like him , although it may just be because i 'm comparing him to juncker . 
  are the germans killing taxpayers ? 
  i assumed that it was , since the title of the image says `` spanish navy sends patrol boat infanta cristina ( p77 ) into gibraltar waters '', 
  that 's completely irrelevant since the picture in the link is of a spanish ship in british waters . 
  are you assuming that i voted leave ? 
   it 's fine to break international law if you do it regularly, 
   britain : english motherfuckers , do n't you speak it ? 
  spend an afternoon in birmingham and you will learn that the answer is no . 
  okay , that 's fair enough i guess . 
  like 85 % of the uk are english , so it 's a reasonable assumption . 
  as a matter of fact i am english and i was really just being a dick . 
  is this a joke ? 
  did scotland , wales and northern ireland stop existing overnight ? 
  what does this have to do with trump ? 
  i was mostly joking . 
  i realise that it happens fairly regularly , i just find some of the responses to it amusing . 
  judging by your comment history you hate all `` anglo-saxons '' you 're a caricature of yourself . 
  no i just found it funny . 
  it 's nice that you assume i 'm english as well . 
  r/europe when a random lord implies war with spain : omg crazy brits !, 
  r/europe when spain breaks international law : haha nice one, 
  he 's a rear admiral , but he 's retired . 
  you keep the rank after leaving the service but he has no current role in the british military . 
  if he was still in and had said this , he would be fired . 
  as for downing street , there 's nothing in your link about that . 
  it was talked about by a * former * conservative leader and a random ex-rn bloke . 
  this has not been discussed by military staff or senior conservative ministers , as you seem to be suggesting . 
  neither the uk nor the eu are empires . 
  most of europe is in the eastern hemisphere . 
  he 's not the defence secretary , he 's a former conservative leader and is currently in the house of lords . 
  he has literally no role in the uk government . 
  i have no idea why he was even being interviewed on the subject . 
  it 's certainly an interesting suggestion . 
  i imagine they 'd have their own devolved assembly if it were to happen . 
  would we have to call it the united kingdom of great britain , northern ireland and gibraltar ? 
   how much of it will it receive post-brexit ? 
  we ca n't know for sure , but i 've seen nothing to suggest that it will receive any less  how much does it receive now from the eu since the uk is a net contributor to the eu , i imagine scotland is as well . 
  one can argue that the trade benefits offset this cost - and that was one of the main reasons why i supported remain - but brussels is n't giving free money to scotland , while westminster is . 
   how much will staying/leaving eu/uk benefit scottish people culture and economy ? 
  i think i have addressed the economic question already , so i wo n't talk about it again . 
  as for the other two , i think that 's a very subjective question that can only be answered by scots , although it should be noted that scots are culturally much closer to the rest of the uk than they are to anywhere else in europe . 
   will scotland be more independent as a member of uk or eu ? 
  the uk has much more central control over its constituent countries than the eu has over its member states . 
  that being said , scotland has almost 10 % of the seats in the uk parliament and would only have about 1-1 .5 % of the seats in the european parliament if independent . 
   does it desire to be independent ? 
  the 2014 referendum and the vast majority of opinion polls would suggest that it does not . 
  i hope this answers your questions . 
   it makes no sense to treat both equally maybe not to you , but it 's what both sides want to do and it 's the most likely outcome . 
  it amazes me that in the second round polls , macron does better against fillon that he does against le pen . 
  it 's such a turnaround from a couple of months ago . 
  the rights of eu citizens in the uk and uk citizens in the eu are directly tied to one another and both sides have signaled their intention to make a reciprocal agreement near the beginning of negotiations . 
  i think it 's fair to say that scotland would be better off in the uk than the eu , since they get massive fiscal transfers from england ( or , more specifically , from london and se england ) to the tune of about 10 % of their gdp . 
  in addition , their trade with ruk is about four times the size of their trade with the eu . 
  i 'm not so sure about northern ireland . 
  i think that in general it 's good for islands to be politically and economically unified , and from what i gather a lot of business is cross-border . 
  that being said , northern ireland also receives a lot of money from ruk and i do n't know if the republic could handle a similar bill . 
  i would guess that the best situation for northern ireland would be in the uk without a hard border with the republic , but i do n't know if that 's achievable . 
  edit : fuck me if you 're gon na downvote at least tell me why i 'm wrong . 
  technically , `` united kingdom of gre ** a ** t brit ** a ** in ** a ** nd northern irel ** a ** nd '' has four as in it . 
  you 've still spelt it wrong , 
  could you mean insects ? 
  it 's more low population density than anything else . 
  i would n't be surprised if they have more pubs per capita than anywhere else . 
  it does surprise me that there 's only one pub on lewis and harris though . 
  anybody wondering about how much of a cunt this guy is should note that he was expelled from school for stealing lead from the roof and selling it . 
  most of scotland is more germanic than celtic - for example , far more scottish people speak scots than scots gaelic . 
  it 's really only parts of the western highlands that are genetically and linguistically celtic . 
  there 's a similar situation in wales , with north wales being celtic and south wales being germanic . 
  it 's not an island . 
  why does everyone think it 's an island ? 
  technically yes , that 's probably the best option , but it seems that the overwhelming majority of gibraltarians want to remain british , so it 's not really feasible . 
  i 'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that we 're leaving . 
  i do n't think spain is actually trying to take over gibraltar , since it would probably be impossible - the gibraltarians would never accept it , and the political will exists in the uk to do a berlin airlift-style operation if spain blockaded the rock . 
  spain most likely just wants them to stop being a tax haven . 
  that being said , it 's a bit hypocritical of the eu to back spain up on saying `` tax havens are bad '' when they do basically nothing about luxembourg . 
  i think most other nations reserve the right to use nuclears weapons in retaliation against other non-nuclear wmds ( i.e. 
  chemical or biological weapons ) , but still only have a defensive policy . 
  we 're less than a week in to brexit and people are already talking about land grabs and war . 
  this is gon na be a very long two years . 
  vikings aside , sweden had [ a few ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_overseas_colonies ) tiny colonies . 
  it does n't really count though . 
  oh yeah , i agree . 
  i think the only countries that would ever really consider launching nukes are north korea and israel , and that would only be if they were being invaded and overrun . 
  i 'm just trying to highlight how ridiculous the idea of war between the uk and spain is . 
  talking about nukes is no more preposterous . 
  i 'm not saying we 're gon na nuke spain . 
  i 'm saying that both premises of the article are ridiculous . 
  it 's a pointless article for two reasons : 1 . 
  britain and spain are nowhere near going to war 2 . 
  the royal navy can cripple any country on the planet by atomising a couple of cities really it 's just a waste of time for everyone, 
  gibraltar is n't an island .
