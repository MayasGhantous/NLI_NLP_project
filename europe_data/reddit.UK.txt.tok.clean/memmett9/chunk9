   french are to much on commie side . 
  if anything , this helps le pen , since she 's economically more left-wing than either macron or fillon . 
  it does n't mean she 'll win , but i 'm unwilling to rule it out . 
  well we just came out of the us election season , which lasts about 1.5 years . 
  it 's gon na be weird seeing one that only lasts a couple of months . 
  i know ronald reagan promised the government that they could borrow a us carrier if one of ours got sunk , so that might have solved it . 
  i can see that being an ... interesting international border . 
  the fact that the map has borders between england , wales and scotland , as well as between northern ireland and the republic , suggests that this is n't the case . 
  not to mention the fact that when the government does n't provide access to abortions , some people inevitably try unsafe methods , which can lead to all sorts of medical complications or , in extreme cases , death . 
  that 's true , and gibraltar could be very easily blockaded by land , but a naval counter-blockade would require a fleet several orders of magnitude more powerful than the royal navy that is capable of long-distance expeditionary warfare . 
  the only countries that could pull it off would be the usa and possibly china or russia . 
  i think [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_bophuthatswana_crisis ) counts as an example of a violent power transfer , even if it was n't at a national level . 
  i guess the royal navy could probably hold the straits against any individual country in the mediterranean . 
  if multiple countries united , it might be a different story . 
  thankfully we 're all friends and this is all hypothetical . 
  an [ uncodified constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uncodified_constitution ) is most definitely a legitimate type of constitution . 
  there is no debate over whether or not the uk has a constitution in a legal context . 
  the people 's judean front is weak and irrelevant . 
  the true enemy is the judean people 's front . 
  [ `` lawful administration '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_utrecht ), 
  it 's not really weird , though , if it happened to every country . 
  obviously our constitution is very different from most others , but it 's still a constitution . 
  since we are a constitutional monarchy , by definition we have a constitution . 
  you could argue ( although you probably should n't ) that everyone else has weird constitutions , since ours was made before theirs . 
  with regards to nato , [ they did it before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato#french_withdrawal ) , although that was in response to what charles de gaulle saw as us/uk dominance of the alliance - and he was probably right , since nato headquarters almost always has an american general as commander and a british one as deputy commander . 
   the european anti-fraud office ( olaf ) has insisted le pen , 48 , a frontrunner in france 's presidential campaign , repay the money , a total of $ 340,000 . 
  this gave me a chuckle . 
  i get that it 's a french acronym , but the fact that it is n't all capitals makes it look like the anti-fraud office is actually just called olaf . 
  you 're right . 
  it 's the royal navy who are the most powerful in europe . 
  [ that is an outright lie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitution_of_the_united_kingdom ), 
  uk  france this makes me a happy redditor seriously , though , what the fuck is going on with belgium ? 
  i 'm sure you know better than the experts who compiled this list . 
  i could be wrong , but i think botswana is the only african country to have never had a violent power transfer since gaining independence . 
  edit : spelling, 
  it just seems hypocritical to criticise the uk for giving up its colonies after ww2 when belgium - and pretty much every other european country - did the same . 
  why not just criticise colonialism generally ? 
   can blockade the mediterranean in war with gibraltar . 
  i mean , the strait of gibraltar is only about 15km across at its narrowest . 
  i 'm no naval expert , but it ca n't be that difficult to blockade . 
  i imagine a handful of destroyers and frigates plus a couple of attack submarines could pretty much lock it down , although feel free to correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  [ thankfully , belgium is entirely guiltless when it comes to colonialism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgian_colonial_empire ), 
  from [ this ] ( http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisa-2015-united-kingdom.pdf ) :  within the united kingdom , students in england score 512 points , on average , and students in northern ireland score 500 points , on average -- both above the oecd average . 
  students in scotland score 497 points , around the oecd average , while students in wales score 485 points , which is below the oecd average . 
  so really it 's the welsh we should be blaming . 
  not that i have anything against them . 
  i thought the prevalence of red hair in ireland was due to celtic roots of the population . 
  i know that in the uk , red hair is most common in the west and blonde hair in the east , with the areas of greater germanic settlement ( e.g. 
  yorkshire , east anglia ) having the highest proportion of blondes and the areas that remained celtic for longer ( e.g. 
  scotland , wales ) having the highest proportion of redheads . 
  this is n't strictly relevant , but i love the title `` taoiseach '' . 
  i think it translates to `` chieftain '' in gaelic . 
  i guess the logic is that 1,000 western troops is better than 100,000 russian ones . 
  they 'd prefer tearing up the first amendment to the second , though . 
  latest second round polls : * fillon ( 56 % ) vs le pen ( 44 % ) * macron ( 62 % ) vs le pen ( 38 % ) i 'm not saying i think she 'll win , but it 's definitely a mistake to rule it out . 
  if she 's up against fillon in the second round then she could have a decent chance . 
  what 's your source on that ? 
  everything i have seen refutes this claim . 
  to my knowledge , only five countries meet the nato target - the us , poland , estonia , greece and the uk - and only six meet the un aid target - denmark , norway , sweden , the netherlands , luxembourg and the uk . 
  so it looks like the uk is the only one that meets both . 
  something to be proud of , in my opinion . 
  edit : apparently romania 's new budget for this year includes 2 % of gdp as defence spending . 
  well he is a eurofederalist . 
  it makes sense that he 'd like european comics . 
  it 's a bit complicated - see the edit of my comment above for details . 
  that being said , we are the reigning world champions when it comes to exporting monarchy . 
  i think the danish and norwegian royal houses are also german in origin , as is the belgian one , and the swedish royal family were originally french . 
  so to sum up , of the seven constitutional monarchies in europe , five are german and two are french . 
  which is ironic , considering that both germany and france are republics . 
  edit : i forgot about luxembourg because it has a grand duke rather than a king or queen . 
  the current grand duke is from a german cadet branch of both another german house and an italian cadet branch of the bourbons , so take your pick really . 
  what i want to know is how you 'd combine the english and swiss flags in the new union jack . 
  the current one was actually [ german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_windsor ) originally . 
  i do n't think this is actually our largest - i believe that title goes to [ this one ] ( http://i1.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article1991339.ece/alternates/s615/the-orchid-was-growing-in-the-middle-of-cardiff-s-coryton-roundabout-487067188.jpg ) in coryton , cardiff . 
  the most impressive , however , is the famous [ magic roundabout ] ( http://www.whereitis.co.uk/_media/magic-roundabout-a-masterpi_med.jpeg ) in swindon . 
  well how do you attack other drivers with swords if you 're driving on the right-hand side ? 
  the problem with the uk ( and western european countries in general ) is that , while we spend quite a lot on our military , we spend it on a very small amount of highly-advanced equipment . 
  that 's excellent for smaller-scale expeditionary wars , like the falklands or afghanistan , but in a major war against russia we simply do n't have the numbers . 
  the nordic countries would definitely be ones to watch . 
  while they would n't really want to get involved , if i were finnish i would probably think `` if we do n't do anything now we 'll be next '' . 
  another factor would be non-eu nations - ukraine could play a very important role , for example . 
  turkey is a bit of wildcard , and i suspect they 'd probably stay out of it , but there 's probably an equal chance of them invading russia over the caucasus or using it as an opportunity to steal some greek islands . 
  here 's what i think would happen : * poland would definitely fight * the uk would , but only if the usa did as well * germany and france * might * get involved , but i doubt either would do it without the other * italy and spain probably would n't, 
  has france ever experienced something similar to the `` shy tory factor '' that has become famous in the uk ? 
  with macron and fillon so close , just one percentage point could make a big difference . 
  i 'm not sure if i 'd put money on le pen winning , but i certainly would n't rule it out . 
  as for wilders , he 's dropped a little in the polls lately , and the dutch system means that even if he 's the largest party he 's unlikely to be invited to join a coalition . 
  may i offer my sincerest apologies to the european medicines agency and european banking authority . 
   brexit close so , according to our government , it 's a huge majority for macron and we 've got nothing to worry about . 
  i 'm pretty sure the saudis are the exception to the rule . 
  the other countries with the highest military expenditures pretty much directly correlate to those with the most powerful militaries . 
  rounding correctly , that translates to her losing 48-52 . 
   in the same sense thailand is better off than myanmar , cambodia , and the other former southeast asian colonies . 
  not that your point is n't generally true , but i think it 's somewhat interesting that malaysia , which was colonised , is doing better than thailand , which was n't . 
  i think there is some debate over whether the demographic differences in ireland ( i.e. 
  protestants in the north , catholics in the south ) is primarily due to the plantations or the natural population flow between ulster and scotland . 
  i imagine the two had quite close ethnic and familial ties , possibly some left over from the time of d\u00e1l riata . 
  that being said , gaels did populate lots of western scotland , largely in the kingdom of [ d\u00e1l riata ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%c3%a1l_riata ) . 
  it could be that as well , but the cigarette tax definitely does keep going up . 
  i suspect the point being made was that , culturally , scotland is broadly anglo-saxon .
