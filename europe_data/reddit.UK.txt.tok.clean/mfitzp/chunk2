   salafi women in several countries , including saudi arabia , veil their faces because they believe the face of a woman is considered awrah . 
  since the burkini does n't cover the face , it 's not compatible with saudi salafism ( wahhabism ) . 
  a lot of them [ are n't black ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=burkini&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1333&amp;bih=1060&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjeukvk5t7oahvkjmakhbzrbd4q_auibigb#imgrc=d0eeonndqgn5im%3a ) . 
  the name is daft , since it 's nothing like a [ burkha ] ( https://www.google.nl/search?q=burkini&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1333&amp;bih=1060&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjeukvk5t7oahvkjmakhbzrbd4q_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=burkha ) . 
  perhaps , but it 's a bit of a leap to assume everyone wearing one * is * . 
  the burden of proof falls on the people making this ridiculous accusation , and i have n't seen any shred of evidence . 
  if only the burkini had something to do with salafism , it might be marginally less ridiculous to ban it . 
  the burkini has * nothing to do with salafism * . 
  it was invented by [ an * australian * of lebanese origin , in 2004 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burqini ) . 
   zanetti estimates that 40 % of her customer base has been non-muslim there is [ an interview with the designer here ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/i-created-the-burkini-to-give-women-freedom-not-to-take-it-away ) . 
   when i invented the burkini in early 2004 , it was to give women freedom , not to take it away . 
  my niece wanted to play netball but it was a bit of a struggle to get her in the team -- she was wearing a hijab . 
  my sister had to fight for her daughter to play , had to debate the issue and ask , why is this girl prevented from playing netball because of her modesty ? 
  does n't sound very salafi . 
  the question of needing to maintain `` modesty '' is not something i agree with . 
  but , it 's entirely up to someone else whether they show off their skin . 
  the whole point of the burkini is that if you * choose to not show off your skin , you can still go to a beach/do sport * . 
  how is that something you can disagree with ? 
  the most ridiculous thing about this situation is that if she had called the garment by a different name , it would never have been banned . 
  `` what 's the point of sunning on the beach if you 're already brown ? '', 
  should we ban brown people from going to the beach ? 
  so we 're going to teach them about freedom by forcing them to do things against their will ? 
  got it . 
  being free to wear what you want is part and parcel of `` freedom of expression ( speech ) '' . 
  you 're defending the erosion of the very thing you claim to be supporting . 
  because plenty of muslims evidently * do * choose not to wear one . 
   because they can not chose . 
  this is utter nonsense . 
  i ca n't believe the irony is lost on so many people . 
  everyone in nice should wear speedos 24/7 . 
  it 's the only way to be safe !, 
   `` i 'm a muslim woman and i believe exposing parts of my body is indecent '' . 
  there are non-muslims who think `` exposing parts of my body is indecent '' , and that is entirely their right . 
  if they go to the beach fully covered they would be left alone . 
  so the problem bit is `` i 'm a muslim '' . 
  france is fighting a backwards ideology by going backwards itself . 
  it 's so crazy , it just might work !, 
  ( no , it wo n't ), 
  i must have missed the part where terrorist attacks were being done by women in burkinis . 
  making her take it off offends my convictions . 
  what now ? 
  what a violent waste of a biscuit . 
  are you pro-ireland or anti-ireland ? 
  but seriously , good job . 
  the lack of quality eu coverage is part of the reason we 're in this mess in the first place . 
  i honestly do n't know . 
  my entire knowledge of immigration and marriage is based on the film [ green card ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099699/ ) . 
  i did have a job arranged with a dutch employer , so maybe that helped me avoid some things . 
  `` luxembourg : close to other , better , places . '', 
  uncertainty . 
  are you sure ? 
  i moved to the netherlands and literally put my stuff in a car , crossed the channel and moved into a rented apartment . 
  i had to register with the local municipality , but that is no different to dutch citizens and took all of 30 minutes . 
  yep , 2 years in so far so if they kick off article 50 by the end of the year i 'll come up a year short . 
  my dutch girlfriend is hinting not-so-subtly that i could get around this with marriage . 
  unfortunately i live in the netherlands , but there are a lot of brits here so remaining hopeful there will be some sort of deal . 
  i consider eu citizenship to be part of my identity and i 'm slightly pissed to discover that someone else can vote it away . 
  if there is any way to keep it , sign me up . 
  i think i 'm still in anger . 
  i voted remain , and i * did * wa n't more europe . 
  but i 'll grant that is n't the position of everyone . 
   remain would have led to more europe even though the majority clearly does n't . 
  36 % of the electorate clearly does n't want that . 
  as i wrote somewhere else :  36 % of the electorate voted to leave ( 52 % of the 70 % who were entitled to vote who voted ) . 
  it 's impossible to know which way that other 30 % would have voted , but i think it 's fair to say that most of them have not-very-strong opinions on it either way . 
  with this result 36 % of the electorate are getting what they want , which is fine ( it is the majority of those that voted ) . 
  but if the shit starts to hit the fan , those 30 % with no real opinion might start getting opinions , and they 're only going to go one way . 
  i agree this could have been avoided ... so ... many ... times . 
  but again our political parties ' self interest took precedent to the country ... plus \u00e7a change . 
  i 've accepted the result , i 'm now just holding out for a silver lining to this very dark cloud , where the eu reforms , integrates , and we come back in a few years ( 25 + ) down the line after we 've got the dregs of empire out of our system ( dead ) . 
  i 'm sorry my countryman is a prick . 
  we wo n't let him out again . 
  i think you forgot to insert `` helping to create the eu '' between the other two ... and `` bankruptcy '' at the end . 
  ... do n't forget 2016 - the magna cunta . 
  how * could * the government prepare a plan , when they did n't know what the vote leave campaign would promise until that promise was emitted from boris , gove or farage 's mouth ? 
  they categorically can not implement the things that * were * promised , because they 're mutually exclusive . 
  i do blame the government for not defining the `` package '' on both sides of the referendum before campaigning began . 
  it should have been a clear case of voting `` keep it as it is '' vs. `` eea '' ( or something else ) . 
  it 's embarrassing that we 're represented globally by this bunch of self-serving morons . 
  internal party politics has fucked the world economy . 
  good job . 
  even worse , they 'll probably get voted in again . 
  36 % of the electorate voted to leave ( 52 % of the 70 % who were entitled to vote who voted ) . 
  it 's impossible to know which way that other 30 % would have voted , but i think it 's fair to say that most of them have not-very-strong opinions on it either way . 
  the negative impacts of leaving the eu will be felt by everyone , including the 33 % that voted to stay , and the 30 % that did n't care one way or another at the time . 
  even if the vote leavers remain resolutely sure of their opinion , we 'll have a country where 63 % of people can honestly say `` i did n't vote for this ! '', 
  as the country goes to shit . 
  i do n't think we should ignore the result because we `` do n't like it '' -- if people ca n't be bothered to vote , i have little sympathy -- but given that it 's impossible to give the leavers what they were promised ( # 350 million/wk ; no freedom of movement ; access to the single market ) it 's shaping up to be a complete mess . 
  the tories are too afraid of the right wing press to do anything about it though , so off the cliff we march .

  come on now , i 'm british ... it 's unusual enough i know liechtenstein exists , never mind how to spell it . 
  ^ i ^ got ^ it ^ right [ ^ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4qexyt/ben_juda_on_an_eea_agreement/d4sydio ) ^ though . 
  i lived with a guy from luxembourg when i was at university in edinburgh . 
  it 's not you is it ? 
  ( 1:500,000 chance , i like those odds ) . 
  it really is hard to understand it as anything other than xenophobia . 
  `` i 'm ok with * this * group of elected representatives telling me what to do , but not * that * group of elected representatives . '', 
  ... when the only fundamental difference between the two groups is that one of them contains more foreign people . 
  referendums are hardly a fundamental part of the uk 's democratic system . 
  ah , i take that point ... but if a clear plan would have helped the leave campaign , i expect they would have formulated one .
