  the difficulty would be in selling a position that kept `` freedom of movement '' ( which would lose a considerable number of votes ) or losing `` access to the single market '' ( which would sound like economic suicide ) . 
  specific arguments and positions are always easier to argue against than vague assertions and bluster . 
  why do you think that would have helped the `` leave '' case ? 
  it was stupid to ask a yes/no question when the yes answer was for multiple , contradictory things ( e.g. 
  access to single market , but no free movement ) . 
  there is literally no way to give the yes voters what they want . 
  the outline deal ( aka `` a plan '' ) should have been sorted out before the vote . 
  the [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4qexyt/ben_juda_on_an_eea_agreement/d4sgwmg ) pointed to [ this ` article ' ] ( http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=86122 ) . 
  i 've also seen references to [ this table ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement_for_workers_in_the_european_union#cite_ref-liechquota_28-0 ) on wikipedia . 
  i realise this is complete fantasyland stuff , do n't worry . 
  a ` quota ' is a very different thing to ` choosing who does and does not come here ' . 
  the referendum was * awful * ... why would anyone want another ? 
  i 've read brexiters holding up ~ ~ leichtenstein ~ ~ liechtenstein as an example of a country that has access to the single market but opts out of freedom of movement . 
  no offence to ~ ~ leichtenstein ~ ~ liechtenstein , but that 's aiming pretty low . 
  i was actually joking ... a reference to all the jobs moving to the eu in response to the brexit . 
  we lost the power long ago , we just have n't realised it yet . 
  this is going to be a slow , painful , wake-up call ... 
  i hope we 'll be better for it . 
  we 've started by giving them lots of our jobs . 
  this really has the feeling of a breakup , where the guy then tries to go back on it with '' ... but we can still hang out , right ? '', 
  let 's make a laughing stock of ourselves ... while people are still listening !, 
  i think this is the thing forgotten by the leave campaign . 
  they say `` 52 % of the british electorate voted for < x  so we have to give it to them '' ... completely ignoring that at least 52 % of the eu electorate 's response to that would be a not so polite `` fuck you '' . 
  not to mention , the latter group of people is significantly larger than the first . 
  just for the record , we 're not all idiots . 
  oh , that 's fair enough , i was moving the goalposts . 
  i said it was integral , and you 've clearly provided evidence that it 's not . 
  i think there might be a distinction there between free trade ( us/ca ) and free market ( eu ) . 
  but like i said , i am not an economist . 
  i 'm not sure i would hold us/mexico trade relations up as an example of success . 
  i do n't know much about us/canada movement , always thought they had a very open border . 
  yeah , i 'm no economist , but i 'm pretty sure free movement of labour is considered an integral part of a functioning free market . 
  the workers need to be able to go to where the work is . 
  probably had a bet on what was the most ridiculous thing he could get away with saying in his last speech . 
   here it is again for you . 
  it 's definitely , `` yeh , well scotland can f < something '' , so maybe `` forget it '' . 
  but , i mean , this is nigel . 
  i do n't , but i 'll have a dig through my history . 
  the tl ; dr of it was that all ex-colonial/imperial countries of europe ended their run getting roundly beaten , losing their colonies ( or in the case of germany world wars ) at the pointy end of a bigger power 's stick . 
  that humiliation led to a more realistic appraisal of each countries power ( or lack thereof ) that made coming together in collective union more feasible . 
  each player * knew * they could be beaten by the others ( or someone else ) , so you end up with a national identity that is n't tied up in how big your stick is . 
  the uk has never really `` lost '' ( except maybe suez , which we collectively agreed to forget about ) and we 've even got our big friend the us to reassuringly tell us that we 're still special and important . 
  we get * treated * like we 're important , in part because we expect it , and we expect it because it 's * always been like that * . 
  now suddenly we wo n't be . 
  i think it 'll do us good . 
  i would be happy with an outline `` best case scenario '' , that has been rigorously fact-checked for feasibility . 
  i do . 
  i voted remain , and would have ticked `` even more in '' if that had been a choice . 
  do n't enjoy being tarred with the same brush as a bunch of backward racists ( * standard disclaimer that not all exit voters were racist , just wrong ) . 
  i support scotland leaving for this exact reason , i 'm gutted i 'm going to lose my eu citizenship . 
  if there is a mechanism to allow them to keep theirs , have at it . 
  that 's fair enough , it 's completely about finding somewhere you ` fit ' . 
  being english the dutch can seem a bit unfriendly ( they tend to make close friends and keep them , for life ) , less cheerful with strangers , open to casual chat , etc. 
  but you do get used to it , anywhere you go you 'll need to adapt to new social `` norms '' ... at least it 's not japan or something  in scandinavia i 've only been to copenhagen , denmark , which was basically like the netherlands except colder and with more concrete . 
  quite liked it though , and people are friendly there . 
  definitely plenty of good research options in sweden/denmark , and it 's an interesting and beautiful place to be . 
  i 've heard good things about germany for research/expat living , both munich and berlin would be good options . 
  honestly , if i did n't have a dutch girlfriend i 'd probably head to berlin myself !, 
  definitely would n't if they outlined the deal that would be implemented . 
  we 're going to end up with something that nobody wanted ... and fewer than wanted to stay in . 
  exactly , they 've just alienated the people most able to leave and make money . 
  pick one a ) stay in the uk and have access to all the jobs in the uk b ) move to the eu and have access to all the jobs in the eu . 
  it would be funny , if it was n't so depressing . 
  the netherlands is good . 
  it 's probably one of the easier eu expat experiences you could get , not least since everyone speaks perfect english . 
  it is very similar to the uk , but still took some getting used to - not understanding , how things work , etc. 
  i went through a period of ` homesickness ' - really missing pubs and real bacon - but that would be the same anywhere . 
  you can get brown sauce , beans and tea bags in the supermarket . 
  if you want to settle permanently and be ` integrated ' in dutch life you will need to speak some dutch , but in research there is a huge mix of eu nationalities ( my lab has a lot of italians ) . 
  education at lower levels is taught in dutch , but science/engineering courses in university are in english . 
  research is all in english , and while dutch people in groups will of course talk dutch , they do n't have a problem speaking english when you 're around . 
  honestly , just do it . 
  you wo n't regret it . 
  once you 've left your home country once , struggled , survived and succeeded , the whole world is open to you . 
  there was a plan a ? 
  i 'm already out ( in the netherlands ) and was planning on returning in 2 years ( with a dutch girlfriend , who will be a trained medical doctor ) . 
  but now there is no way i 'm going back . 
  the result of this vote feels like a giant `` fuck you '' to me from my own country . 
  quite rightly too , as a pro-eu brit i 'm also sick of us acting like a petulant child putting our interests far , far , above those of the team . 
  i think the current situation was inevitable in a way , it was n't sustainable as it was , the referendum has just brought things to a head . 
  i 'm just hoping that after we 've had a good kicking , we 'll see sense and come back as an equal partner . 
  i read an interesting article that described this as the uk 's `` end of empire '' moment . 
  when we finally wake up and realise that we 're no longer relevant . 
  to be honest , it would be better for the eu if we were in it without our special-snowflake treatment . 
  i expect the outcome of all this will be we end up in eea land , then 25-50 years down the line end up back in the eu without our special arrangements . 
  i do n't think `` stay '' is viable anymore ( we 've created a lot of bad will from this ) and actually having us out of the way has its benefits . 
  ... and knickers . 
  the french love our knickers . 
  long term economic plan : make more knickers . 
  i would n't blame the eu if this is the approach - english voters were advocating the same punishment for scotland if it left the union . 
  funny how different things look when you 're on the wrong side of a decision . 
  basically ... think this is going to be a hard sell . 
  shame nobody had a clue what they were actually voting for . 
  what a plonker . 
   your natality ai n't in you just taught me a new word . 
  that 48 % needs to start making babies . 
  i voted for remain , and still do n't * want * us to leave , but i agree - there is no benefit to anyone in dragging this out . 
  unfortunately , it looks like nobody wants to take responsibility for pulling the trigger . 
  the problem is there is no plan , and it 's looking increasingly likely that the leave campaigners ( boris/gove ) never actually wanted to leave the eu . 
  a narrow lose offered boris a stepping stone into the pm job , with the bonus of bargaining power against the eu .
