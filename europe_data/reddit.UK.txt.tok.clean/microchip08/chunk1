the uk has four opt-outs of the eu : schengen , the euro , human rights ( lisbon ) , and police legislation . 
  only denmark has that many ( substitute schengen for defence ) . 
  yes , but that 's the regional level , not the national level , so it does n't count for these purposes . 
  welsh is n't an official eu language ( because it 's not an official language at the national level ) .

   the uploader has not made this video available in your country . 
  the bbc also does a voiceover for foreign interviews . 
  the voiceover comes in a couple of seconds after the interviewee starts talking , presumably so that you do n't get the impression that the interviewee was speaking english . 
  from an [ old bbc article ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ifs/hi/newsid_4270000/newsid_4273500/4273597.stm ) :  when we choose to use a voice-over , it is generally because we feel it will be easier for our audience to follow the flow of a piece if they actually hear the words spoken - this is particularly the case in short news clips . 
   in longer interviews , where the nuances are more important , we do tend to use subtitles more often . 
  the polls gave a lead to pro-independence for the first time ( ever ) . 
  answering the other half of the question : bbc news ~ ~ 24 ~ ~ often carries obama 's statements live , before cutting away when he starts talking about domestic issues . 
  especially true : world war russian, 
  is n't that what is expected ? 
  the echr is full of qualified rights , whereas the us constitution has unqualified ones . 
  there 's an awful lot more `` except '' and `` unless '' in the european version . 
  ( however , the eu version applies to everyone in europe , whereas i think the us constitution only applies to us citizens . ), 
  if i understand correctly ( and i have n't been paying attention to the story ) , the tabloids named the various characters in the video after the members of the beatles ( john , ringo , etc. ) . 
  the group do n't call themselves after the band , just the press . 
  is there a longer clip that gives some context ? 
  the [ accompanying statistics ] ( http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/research_stats/deaths_report_1314.pdf ) are interesting .

  as an aside , it always amuses me slightly whenever i see it that the italian for `` fruit salad '' happens to be '' [ macedonia ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/macedonia#italian ) '' .

  the mail is apparently rather popular in the states ( presumably by those who do n't know its reputation ? 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines ) from what i remember reading yesterday , there * was * a restriction on airspace , but only up to a certain level ( which the plane was flying above ) . 
  in english the second is rendered as `` do n't look a gift horse in the mouth '' . 
  i always assumed it was some obscure trojan horse thing , but apparently ( [ wiktionary ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/don%27t_look_a_gift_horse_in_the_mouth ) ) :  since horses ' gums recede as they age , which makes the teeth appear to grow long , checking the teeth of a horse given as a gift is a way of checking for old age .

  judging by my one very brief stay in brussels last year , trams are terrifying and i 'm surprised they do n't happen all the time ... 
  william hague strikes me as one of the few exceedingly competent politicians , actually .

  malta always ^ * gives the uk twelve ; france and the uk exchange points ; uk and ireland give points ; the german speakers give each other points ... 
  allowing a country with [ certain issues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria ) into the eu seems a tad dangerous ; as i understand it , it 's almost literally russia the other side of the river . 
  i 've already had two plaid leaflets and an anti-labour attack leaflet from the lib dems through my door ; they got posted in my letterbox days before my poll card even arrived ... 
  ( they were in international airspace , as they are perfectly entitled to do . ), 
  in the 19th century , there was only one corridor ( which apparently caused massive confusion ) , so some were allegedly grateful when the houses of parliament burnt down in 1834 , because they could add a second corridor . 
  in the lords ( upper , unelected house ) , they also divide physically , but have to huddle together at the ends of the room . 
  presumably the lords are far too civilised for commoner things such as these `` corridors '' ... 
  the state opening of parliament has some crazy traditions : * whilst the queen is at parliament , an mp is held hostage and under guard at buckingham palace to ensure the monarch 's safety * they search the cellars [ just in case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gunpowder_plot ) * the queen 's crown gets its own coach to parliament * after the queen does her speech , the two chambers then debate a response . 
  however , doing it straight away would make it seem like she was telling them what to debate on , so they first take a vote on a pointless ceremonial bill before starting the true debate, 
  the uk seems quite anachronistic then ; westminster mps have a vague `` all say aye '' , where whoever 's loudest wins . 
  if the winner 's obvious ( e.g. 
  near unanimous , or there 's only four people in the room ) , then that 's that . 
  otherwise , the house divides and mps have to physically walk through one of two corridors to register their vote . 
  ( there are some [ interesting stories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_vote_of_no_confidence_in_the_government_of_james_callaghan#sir_alfred_broughton ) regarding the requirement to physically be at parliament to vote . ), 
  the devolved parliaments ( e.g. 
  wales ) have more modern systems , being fairly recent developments . 
  the timing seems a bit awkward anyhow ; you 'll have three consecutive major tournaments , with only one `` rest year '' . 
  * commonwealth games : glasgow ^ ^ gb 2014 , gold city ^ ^ au 2018 * ( winter olympic games : sochi ^ ^ ru 2014 , pyeongchang ^ ^ kr 2018 ) * european games : baku ^ ^ az 2015 , [ unconfirmed ] 2019 * olympic games : rio ^ ^ br 2016 , tokyo ^ ^ jp 2020 and something i just noticed : azerbaijan is on utc +4 / 5 . 
  the only other european nation using utc +4 / 5 is moscow , which certainly does n't give credence to them having much in common with the rest of europe ... 
  presumably they had the most money to throw at it ?

  in gcse ( u.k. end-of-secondary school qualification ) german my teacher always said to use * ss * and we were told never to use * \u00df * ; the rationale was apparently '' * ss * is always correct , but * \u00df * was only correct in a narrow set of ` exceedingly complex ' circumstances ; so never use * \u00df * and your grammar will never be wrong '' . 
  it represents scotland ; when the royal arms is used north of the border , the lion and the unicorn switch places ( as left is superior ) . 
  the unicorn 's chained as , if i recall , it 's bad luck to see a wild unicorn . 
  it comes with a nursery rhyme too : the lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown the lion beat the unicorn all around the town . 
  some gave them white bread , and some gave them brown ; some gave them plum cake and drummed them out of town . 
  the british passport is full of weather symbols , groynes ( those wooden walls you get on beaches ) , and seagulls , as well as the [ shipping forecast ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shipping_forecast ) areas ( for some inexplicable reason ) . 
  apparently it 's the prettiest passport under uv light ( according to some german chap that i met at a belgian conference last year ), 
  it 's the not-scottish [ royal arms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_united_kingdom ) ; it 's a pretty damn complex coat of arms ( the normally very terse heraldric description is a good full paragraph long ) , so presumably it 's only big because anything smaller would lose detail . 
  that said , my passport 's fairly worn ( but only 3/10 years old ) and the detail is starting to become faint . 
  i suppose that if you 've got the space , we may as well use it -- the germans are wasting all that whitespace !, 
  there 's also the shipping forecast printed in microtext on the main passport page : in case the uv weather fronts were n't enough . 
  the portugese passport looks fancy . 
  i like how the british royal coat of arms is the most complex and biggest ...

   `` we strictly observe the confidentiality of our users , their telephone numbers and locations ... we know that there is equipment , so-called ` pirate base stations ' , which allow sms distribution or calls to all mobile telephone numbers of all operators within a particular area . 
  but , as an operator , we are unable to identify the activity of these stations . '', 
  so it was just indeterminate spam , the `` subscribers '' were n't identifiable and therefore not `` registered participant `` s , making the sms nothing more than an apparently futile attempt at getting people to go home ? 
  really ? 
  well , that 's a thoroughly uncontroversial choice ( ! ), 
  that voiceover is painfully upbeat .
