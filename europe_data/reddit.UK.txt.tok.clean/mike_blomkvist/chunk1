it was different in 1941 ... moscow was more of a ` hub ' than it was in the early nineteenth century . 
  i would n't say it 's idiotic , it 's just how it is . 
  same story in europe 100 years ago . 
  [ how i feel being constantly referred to as an ` anglo-saxon ' in this thread ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l09qevz.gif ) . 
  next stop , turkey !, 
  i love how everyone is expressing outrage in this thread that someone could say he prefers indian immigrants over e. european immigrants . 
  and literally one of the top comments is :  as far as i am concerned , poles are far more welcome than indians . 
  literally two sides of the same coin . 
  from my experience working with eastern european people , they really hate indian people . 
  and i 'm not nessessarily having a go at them , because they 're alright . 
  i 'm just wondering whether that 's influencing the voting patern in this thread . 
  exactly , why the fuck is this on +30 ? 
  it 's an obivously racist statement . 
  speaking as an english person , if you work hard and intergrate you 're welcome . 
  there 's a comment up the top :  as far as i am concerned , poles are far more welcome than indians . 
  which is a blatently racist statement , but it 's on like +30 . 
  i do n't care if you 're polish or indian , if you work hard and integrate you deserve a place in our society . 
   re-colonisation i 'm from britain and we would n't touch that with a 10 foot pole . 
  there 's a difference between being bilingual and taking an exam in your first language . 
  if a french person can get a grade a for french , why ca n't i take an english exam ? 
  on your second point . 
  yeah , maybe . 
  second language people should get extra points , perhaps , i do n't how it would work out though . 
  that 's really hurtful , man . 
  sort-of , yeah . 
  on your first point , why is it the uk 's responsibility then ? 
  we 're pretty much the only eu economy to meet nato spending requirement . 
  this benefits everyone , yet the burdon falls most heavily on us . 
  it was just a sidepoint . 
  this does n't necessarily have to happen in the midst of a nuclear war . 
  i 'm thinking we just pretend we have a nuclear weapon . 
  it 's still a ` deterence ' and since there 's a 99 % chance we 'll never use it nobody can call our bluff . 
  it 'll save us a tonne of money . 
  useless in the sense that , if we 'd invested # 5billion a year into the regular armed forces we could use it towards rehabilitation , up-to-date equipment , etc. 
  instead we spend it on floating a nuclear bomb around the ocean . 
  i understand the idea of nuclear deterrance . 
  un security council is an archaic structure we should n't be in anyway . 
  a `` winner-of-ww2 '' group should n't exist in the 21st cenury . 
  what ? 
   so trident as a cost of that would be 0.546 % for an effectively useless weapon . 
  0.5 % of government expenditure is actually quite a lot of money , and if it could be put towards the nhs i do n't think it would be a bad thing . 
  that 's true . 
  i suppose the point i was aiming for is if , say , germany offered to shoulder the cost of nuclear weapons in return for us not having them , it would be a good thing . 
  `` full on economic embargo '' wo n't hurt a big country like russia as much as you 'd think . 
  it 'll hurt , certainly . 
  but it wo n't bring it to its knees . 
  and it may even rally the russians against us . 
  i do n't know what all the acronyms mean but # 4 billion a year is n't `` peanuts '' in my eyes . 
  especially for a weapon that will probably never get used . 
   in the 21st century it 's about economic might . 
  if europe can clean up its economy to the point where they can use use it as a weapon like the sanctions on russia i do n't think a ban on the sale of banana 's to russia will have the same effect as a nuclear bomb on london or berlin . 
  as a brit i would love for us to give up our nuclear weapons , it costs a fortune . 
  i do n't think it would be good for the rest of europe though . 
  we need at least one or two european states to have nuclear weapons . 
  i ca n't help feeling the people who take polish at a-level * probably * already know polish . 
  my french friend did the same thing and aced the exams . 
  feels a bit unfair . 
  wow . 
  what an arseholey way to dismiss his point out of hand . 
  but how long will greece be paying its debts , 60 - 70 years ? 
  greeks will be paying for the mistakes of their fathers , much like germany did . 
   do you think london and birmingham are 100 % safe cities ? 
  no city is 100 % safe . 
  but `` third world '' is a very specific phrase to use and i do n't believe anywhere in the uk can be considered `` third world '' . 
   i don \u00b4 t know which http://i.imgur.com/rg0bs1u.gif, 
  that 's not true at all . 
  there 's already a considerable turkish community in britain and they have integrated well . 
  oh yeah , i forgot this sub turned right-wing shithole last year . 
  seriously , leave you 're house once in a while - it 's really not such a bad place . 
  aye , but it 's not something you want to be remembered for . 
  germany has a rich history that stretches back thousands of years , but all they get remembered for is ` killing jews ' . 
  my country has probably commited more genocide than any other in history , but we get `` small yet strong '' . 
  luck of the draw , i guess . 
  edit : please do n't downvote the person above me , guys . 
  s/he 's just sharing their opinion , nothing wrong with that . 
  we 're culinary masterminds . 
  i do n't want to shock you too much but the only reason we know about stuff thousands of years ago is because of manuscripts written thousands of years ago . 
   they used syrian passports to come in as refugees . 
  source ? 
  it was thought that some used forged passports to get in from syria , but the majority were [ based in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_2015_paris_attacks#identification ) . 
  nevertheless , it 's agreed that none of them were refugees , which is my original point . 
   it really seems like you are trying to obfuscate the facts here . 
  how ? 
  i 'm just saying the facts . 
  all known terrorists we 're eu citizens , hence their ability to cross the border unintruded . 
  nope , all know attacks were [ eu citizens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_2015_paris_attacks ) . 
  same for the charlie hebdo attacks . 
  wait , i do n't understand your point ? 
  op was saying that the sharp increase in migration was the cause of the terrorist attacks . 
  i 'm just saying that the majority of attackers tend to be second/third generation immigrants , and therefore not directly related . 
  well , all the attackers in the paris attacks were eu citizens , so there 's no direct correlation . 
  i 'd say the rise of isis is a more important factor . 
  no need to be rude mate . 
  bloody bread fascist, 
  student loans work in the uk in such a way that it 's basically a tax . 
  you do n't start paying it back until you earn 21k + , and if you never earn 21k + your debt gets wiped off after 30 years . 
   but she encoureged the influx there 's no evidence of that . 
   oh yeah , like how she made the decision to invite millions of people to europe with the rest of the eu , right ? 
  this is simply not true . 
  merkel gave her `` there is no legal limit '' speech in late august , but by that time over [ 250,000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_migrant_crisis#2015 ) had already arrived in 2015 alone .
