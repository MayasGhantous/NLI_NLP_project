  it seems strange for spain to be in the [ same timezone as poland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/time_zones_of_europe.svg ) , is there any reason this is the case ? 
  hey guys , i do n't want to be too negative but i thought it would be an interesting question . 
  what city do you think is most overrated/would not reccomend visiting ? 
  just finished watching this [ video of accents ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mzwkuoxz8 ) of britain/ireland . 
  there 's quite a lot of difference depending on which part of the country you 're from . 
  just curious whether this was the same across all european countries . 
  just wanted to have a competition , but who thinks they have the worst national subreddit ? 
  after the success of / r/casualuk i decided to make / r/casualeurope . 
  it 's basically / r/europe minus the politics . 
  light hearted conversations are highly encouraged . 
  hope you enjoy !, 
  ill give you one example . 
  when the germans were losing the war , they decided to sneak a bunch of revolutionaries ( via train ) into russia to destabalise the regime . 
  among those on the train was vladimir lenin , who would eventually overthrow the regime and replace it was a communist government . 
  let that sink in for a second . 
  if it we 're not for ww1 , it is likely russia never would have become communist . 
  imagine how different would the world be if russia never became communist . 
  that in of itself is enough reason to consider ww1 a major historical event . 
  it makes it difficult to learn other languages abroad . 
  when i lived in denmark for a bit , everytime i tried to speak the local language and stumbled , people would just revert to speaking english . 
  it 's well intentioned but in fact really unhelpful in the long run . 
  in the uk anyone from the commonwealth can vote , which is well over a billion people . 
  so , yeah . 
  it 's a problem , but also an opportunity . 
  i have a conspiracy theory that the uk government is letting a lot of these people leave , keeping track of them , and then ensuring they are kia . 
  it 's a way to purge the extremist faction in british society . 
  but you 're right , the social conditions that caused these people to become extremists in the first place is the real problem . 
  the finns are plotting against us . 
  sorry , i think you misunderstood my point . 
  i 'm not saying poles are lazy , i 'm saying that it 's easy for the polish government to take that position when it 's an expense they do n't have to worry about . 
  i 'm not saying he does n't have a point , but i think it 's easy for poland to be against migrant benefit cuts when they have the [ lowest percentage of foreign-born nationals in the eu . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:non-national_population_by_group_of_citizenship_and_foreign-born_population_by_country_of_birth,_1_january_2013_yb14_ii.png ), 
   anglo-saxon aspirations . 
  that `` european union army '' would basically just be britain and france . 
  germany is still scared if its own shadow in that regards and italy simply ca n't afford a large military . 
  that 's relatively recent compared the the life of the sub . 
  i think some new mods were brought in and some old mods left - and the new mods stopped doing anything to combat the brigaders/stormfronty people . 
  i 'm not sure of the exact reason though . 
  have a look at some more of the threads . 
  it 's a lot less right wing than / r/europe . 
  a lot of people have started moving over to / r/europes . 
  lmao explains why this subreddit got so right wing . 
  because people will make fun of you on / r/europe . 
  i bet a suprising percentage of people would forgot n. ireland is in the uk . 
  i do n't know whether to laugh or cry . 
   there 's not 1 nato base in the former eastern bloc that 's [ not correct ] ( http://www.migflug.com/jetflights/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/natovsrussia.jpg ) . 
  either way i disagree . 
  i think it 's a needless provocation in a time when we should be de-escalating tensions with russia . 
  i think modern warfare has moved passed `` get as close as possible '' . 
  if moving troops closer adds no strategic advantage than we should avoid doing it . 
  this is no time for jingoism . 
  so your contention is that because we supported each other we should stop supporting each other ? 
   western support during ww1 . 
  of course we supported them we were on the same fucking side . 
  rule 1 of / r/europe is not to critisize poles/poland . 
  it 's like kicking a hornet 's nest . 
  i 'm genuinely interested in what you define `` western-russian collaboration '' ? 
   due to a lack of funding the submarine has been inactive since 1995 ; it is kept in reserve docked in the military sector of the port of constan\u021ba . 
  if assad falls who fills the vacuum ? 
  the most well organised group at the moment is daesh . 
  yeah ... 
  i mean as world leaders go vladimir putin is probably someone in the middle of the good/evil scale . 
  he 's a rational actor who can be dealt with . 
  seems irresponsible to alienate him completely , especially when it 's unlikely to achieve anything . 
  your joke is better than it got credit for . 
  by definition jews were n't assimilated . 
  they had their own religion and many had their own language ( yiddish ) . 
  welcome to / r/europe . 
  of all the books produced in england you 're really going with the silmarillion ? 
  i like that this was ( presumably ) your first thought . 
  so your one of those `` white britain '' guys . 
  each to their own , man . 
  you 're fighting the good fight , but do n't expect to get anywhere on this sub with that opinion . 
  63 % of people in london were born in the uk . 
  the fact that they might not have white skin or be christian means nothing to me . 
  immigrants rarely take up so much of a voting bloc that they can skew the results in the way you are saying . 
  the much more likely scenario is that people who live among immigrants are less likely to beleive the media scare-stories . 
  immigrants rarely take up so much of a voting bloc that they can skew the results in the way you are saying . 
  the more likely situation is that people who live among immigrants are less frightened of them . 
  it does n't work that way honeybun, 
  fair point . 
   no position to administer any assessments . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  as a rule , people in england do n't have a problem with immigrants from france or germany . 
  and i doubt poles have a problem with people from ukraine . 
  but it 's immigrants from further afield that tests a countries ability to be welcoming . 
  and i fear many eastern europeans are failing that test . 
  well , the eu as an institution allowed poles to work abroad in other eu countries . 
  now the eu , in its same capacity , is asking poland to take in a few thousand rufugees , and poles are acting like this is an affront to their entire being . 
  i just think it 's hypocritical thing to do . 
  e / grammar and stuff, 
  what does that even mean ? 
  lol, 
  area 's least affected by immigration are often the most vitriolically against it . 
  in my country , [ areas with the lowest foreign-born populations vote most highly for parties like ukip ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03268/ukip-maps-2_3268290b.jpg ) . 
  i think we 're seeing this phenomenon on an eu-wide scale as well . 
  i 'm really glad because it 's well known that poland is being overwhelmed by immigrants . 
  just [ this graph shows it . ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:foreign-born_population_by_country_of_birth,_1_january_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_yb15.png ) . 
  a whole * 1.6 % * of the population was born outside a poland . 
  lord have mercy , it 's not like it 's the third lowest in the eu or anything .
