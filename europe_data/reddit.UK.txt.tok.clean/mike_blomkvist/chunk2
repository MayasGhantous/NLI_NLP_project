  she was simply responding to events that had already transpired . 
  so basically they want to turn it into a lame duck . 
  exactly !, 
  the ` tial ' sound in english takes a ` shh ' intonation . 
  so i would pronounce the end of ` torrential ' the same as ` controversial ' , hense the confusion . 
  source on that ? 
  this [ unicef ] ( http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/repcard5e.pdf ) study shows uk is about on average with everyone else, 
  d'you know what ? 
  i wrote controversial and then deleted it because i thought it looked wrong . 
  cheers anyway . 
  whoa , calm down there with that controversial opinion on this subreddit . 
  i 've never heard that one before . 
  well , there 's a lot of child abusers being reported and prosecuted . 
  the countries with abnormally `` low '' levels are the ones you have to worry about . 
  all they need is 300 spartans . 
  it 's sad , really . 
  the polish government is run by a load of conspiracy theorists . 
  the tories are pretty mild in all fairness . 
  yeah , fuck those hungarians .

  i think french is the only language in europe that i would consider `` beautiful '' . 
  i 'm flabbergasted . 
  i mean , fair play . 
  i did n't realise schengen was so open . 
  so i could turn up in berlin , and book a flight to paris , and they would n't even check my passport ? 
  that 's crazy . 
   you do n't have to go through passport controls when you land in schengen country with a plane , just walk through the gate which says eu citizens . 
  is that true ? 
  whenever i fly between schengen countries there 's an eu fast-lane but you still have to get your passport checked . 
  how does schengen work on islands like corsica and sardinia , surely you have to go through some sort of passport controls ? 
  that 's not true . 
  most people are voting to stay in . 
  you need to make your flag look less like poland 's . 
  that 's ironic coming from poland who has literally refused to take any refugees . 
  did n't golden dawn come 3rd in recent election ? 
  i mean , they 're straight up neo-nazi 's . 
  [ this is their flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/meandros_flag.svg ) , which definitely does n't look like a swastika . 
  far right newspaper spreading ignorance and bigotry . 
  nothing to see here folks , move along . 
  i think germany pursuing a larger and larger trade surplus is going to lead to instability . 
  its irresponsible economically and no different to s. european countries running large deficits . 
  this sounds like good news but it 's not . 
  a high trade surplus is just as dangerous to eurozone stability as southern european deficits . 
  the scary thing is that germany does n't seem to be doing anything about it . 
  [ as if you 've got a plum in your mouth .

  i do think it 's a shame we 're limiting non-eu migration to compensate for eu migration . 
  half of me thinks we should have a `` flat-rate '' immigration policy . 
  where a certain percentage of each country has the right to apply for a visa . 
  i think it would help with integration as well , it 's a lot better when there are lots of different groups rather than 1 or 2 big ones . 
  you 're right . 
  it 's unlikely we 'll leave , especially as the prime minsister will come out in favour . 
  this referendum was never really about the british public but rather about the tory party . 
  they 're hoping this referendum will pacify the eurosceptics and bring more unity to their party . 
  yes , those are literally the only four entities supporting the remain campaign . 
  na , we 'll stay in . 
  that 's all well and good but this is a joke . 
  david cameron did n't actually manage to negotiate free sandwiches . 
  david cameron will surely go down in history for this great victory .

  historically muslims and jews got on relatively well . 
  it was only since the creation of israel that relations deteriorated .

  i do n't believe that 's true . 
  we 'll soon find out whose right . 
  see you in 6 months . 
  i find that very generalising and offensive . 
  it 's easy for us to forget that most of us are n't interested in politics . 
  when confronted with a choice british people almost always choose the status quo . 
  think of the av referendum , scottish independence and even the general election ( which is not a referendum , but another example of people choosing the status quo ) . 
  imo the eu referendum will be decided by these people . 
  the mixture of fear over economic fallout , and the renegotiation by david cameron will result in them voting `` remain '' . 
  in political circles the eu is huge , but if you ask people in the public who are n't initiated to politics they simply do n't care . 
  they will be the deciding factor in the referendum , and they will almost certainly side with the status quo . 
  you 're massively exaggerating how much people care about the eu . 
  outside of political circles , the eu is simply `` that thing '' which tried to ban curved cucumbers . 
  my opinion is that once david cameron reveals his `` renegotiation '' people will think we 've got one up on brussels and vote to stay in . 
  it does n't matter how artificial the reform are , it will be enough for us to stay in . 
  do n't underestimate how ambivalent people are about the eu here in the uk . 
  for them it 'll be enough to say `` yes , we 've shown one to brussel ! '', 
  and then vote to stay in . 
  i 'd be very cautious of any polls this far away from the referendum . 
  let 's see what the polls are when dave reveals his big `` renegotiation '' . 
  for most people it will simply be enough to save face and remain to stay in the eu . 
   `` that site filled with hateful comments '' . 
  yes , reddit currently has a monopoly on that market . 
  sounds obvious when you say it but that 's exactly right . 
  i do n't know why you 're getting downvoted that 's a fair analysis . 
  absolute tripe . 
  let 's not spread the message please . 
  these people are neo-nazi 's , they do n't need anything to justfy their behaviour . 
  please stop sympathising with them . 
  [ this thread . 
  as others have mentioned , this is more for pr reason for rouhani . 
  if a photographer catches a picture of him near a glass of wine , he faces a massive backlash back home . 
  realpolitik . 
  iran is not going to change overnight , and since rouhani is considered a progressive might aswell keep him in office as long as possible . 
  also , rouhani is proposing to invest $ 17 billion into the italian economy . 
  i suppose they decided covering up a few genitals was worth it for a massive amount of fdi .
