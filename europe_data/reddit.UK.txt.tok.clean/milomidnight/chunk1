they are basically revengeing a revenge that revenges a revenge ... and so on . 
  and all that mixed with a religious ideology that basically says : killing , suffering and revenge is the golden way . 
  ... i appreciate its an emotive time , but you do realise this was the stereotype of europe and its perpetual conflicts until the end of ww2 ( ie still within living memory ) . 
  nowadays they only wear them in criminal trials not involving child suspects [ ( they were ditched in civil/family courts 10 years ago ) ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6896887.stm ) - originally it was a fashion/authority thing - these days i think judges favour them in criminal trials because they really do help ` anonymise ' the judge . 
  judges are n't the victims of retaliation so there is n't really a danger but you 'd be surprised just how much difference a wig makes in terms of trying to remember what an individual looks like , plus with the black robe the only impression anyone really gets of the judge is a face - there is n't anything personal ( no fashion sense etc ) for an aggressive defendant to latch onto and react against . 
  the judges also do n't have to worry about their appearance , the robes cover whatever they wear and the wigs cover their hair . 
   it would be just as crazy as if wales got its own currency and london had another . 
  increasingly ... i think i 'd support it ( yes everyone i talk to here thinks im a loon ) . 
  i think in the 21st century with so much tied in to digital payment systems more localised currencies may work ( this is admittedly sci-fi at this point ) . 
  i do n't question what you say but there are problems that the uk has always had with the monetarist approach to integration ; namely the incomparability of economies ( already discussed ) and a degree of moral hazard associated with fiscal transfers within one monetary system . 
  regarding the former its worth noting we tried the ` soft euro ' option - the erm - and found it to be destructive to the economy until we crashed out on [ black wednesday ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_wednesday ) regarding the latter there has always been a concern that net contributor states in any monetary union ( whether the eu or usa ) are forced to support states that are net beneficiaries ( or borderline net beneficiaries ) which then use aggressive tax systems to undermine the net contributors they benefit from ; the problem is further compounded because the net beneficiaries are often politically conservative and unwilling to change as they can comfortably live off the federal/central income . 
  in the eu for example ireland is a net beneficiary but undermines the economies of other ( net contributor ) nations because of its tax system ; politically speaking hungary is able to sustain its ultra right wing politics precisely because orban knows he will get eu money - a moral hazard arises because he knows that ultimately his policies wo n't affect the economy - the safety net of central income ( fiscal transfer ) means extremist and normally unsustainable positions regarding tax or politics become the norm . 
  in the us the same occurs when liberal progressive states like california or washington subsidise ` red states ' like south carolina which use aggressive tax policies to attract business from those states in a way that would n't normally be possible ( boeing for example ) . 
  theres a further problem because those ` red states ' benefit from the moral hazard that allows them to sustain policies that encourage poverty precisely because they [ know they 'll receive more federal money ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/which-states-are-givers-and-which-are-takers/361668/ ) . 
  it is for that reason the uk has always been very sceptical about such large and grandiose endeavours as monetary integration . 
  a lack of monetary independence means a politic of resentful dependence grows and festers . 
  it may seem insane to you to suggest the de-dollarisation of america ; but far from being about destroying the united states it would encourage the individual sates to evolve ( and the subsequent exchange rate difference would mean any federal money would go a lor further ) a central monetary policy causes problems , france 's economy is n't stagnant because of its labour laws ( they have n't suddenly turned bad in the last 15 years ) but because the euro simply does n't suit its economy . 
  its forced to make hard labour law changes when before a monetary policy that devalued the currency would have been far less destructive . 
  the euro is dragging and holding back the eu . 
  yup and they call themselves ` ex-pats ' not immigrants , which even i as a brit find absolutely hilarious , i have to stifle a laugh whenever a briton in another country uses ` ex-pat ' . 
  [ david davis does n't even realise the eu does trade deals as a block ] ( https://twitter.com/stevepeers/status/753315030884548608 ), 
  shes being strategic - give those jobs to the brexiters , wait for them to fuck up then replace them in 24 months time . 
  the problem is the vast majority of tory members are n't brexitiers for the same reason he is , they want a complete end to immigration etc - he does n't . 
   will may pull the plug and let the next person handle the ensuing shitstorm ? 
  basically if need be yes ; it 'll be nigh on impossible for the tories to win unless a50 has come before the 2020 election , it would just destroy them during the election . 
  i think people are still so shocked by this they do n't appreciate it is going to happen ( and i say that as a firm remainer feeling fairly dejected about being trapped on a grey island ) ; the uk parliament is n't like the rest of the continent - they are n't going to hold another referendum a few years down the line ( like ireland ) or basically ignore the result and redraft ( like the french with the european constitution that became the lisbon treaty ) . 
  the decision to hold a referendum was taken ( massive mistake imho , the uk has sparse history of such direct democracy ) , the debate held - and the public had their say . 
  it would be a complete disenfranchisement of the electorate to ignore it . 
  my only hope is they 'll come to some agreement on trade , then bilaterally - over the years - re-establish freedom of movement and the other protections of the eu . 
  ie the uk shouts ` we 're out look we 're out ' then little by little re-establishes contacts ( which will happen because the 48 % want their views heard ) the main point is that a50 has to be triggered and the uk has to leave otherwise ukip would just continually hammer the point that democracy is a sham and a50 would become a recurring rally cry . 
  so brexit will occur . 
  but i suspect that over the following years either bilateral agreements or uk-eu agreements will mean there is some form of closer co-operation , probably via the uk paying more etc. 
   why you would want to collide with those things is beyond me but go ahead and do it . 
  they do n't ` want ' to do anything . 
  they were n't supposed to win remember !, 
  the irony is after the brexitiers either chickened out or stabbed each other out of the process the mps left are essentially all remainers . 
  whitehall were prevented from proper preparation for this ( apart from boe where carney is a god send ) they are in no position - in purely administrative terms , let alone in terms of negotiating strategy - to even begin to deal with ministers , and even then the new ministers have n't been appointed and have n't settled into the job . 
  philip hammond , the foreign secretary , now says expect a ~ 6year time frame for it to occur ( and thats before any unforeseen circumstance delays it even more ) . 
  there wo n't be any a50 notification this year , i 'd be surprised if it happens within a year . 
  the british politic has been completely ko 'd by this and it 'll take them some time to figure out what the hell to do ( and thats before the other eu countries counter negotiate ) . 
  if i was placing a bet i 'd say the a50 will come after the french/german elections but before the uk ones in 2020, 
  also do n't you guys have laicite protection laws for these situations ? 
  not possible because the uk is * technically * a quasi-theocratic state with the head of state the leader of their own church ( when the queen meets the pope she does so as the head of one church meeting the head of another ) . 
  as mentioned these ` sharia courts ' are arbitration ` courts ' where people can voluntarily attend . 
  they ca n't override civil courts ( let alone the criminal judicial system ) its just a fact that english common law recognises that people can choose to arbitrate their disputes according to the works of jrr tolkien if they so wish . 
  the us which also ( mainly ) follows english common law also has similar [ ` jewish courts ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beth_din_of_america ) . 
  you can take the proper civil route if you wish - its still there - but arbitration where all parties consent ( obviously within the confines of criminal law ) is acceptable . 
  arguably it does lead to inter community tension and pressures , and a degree of insularity in the community concerned ( look at both the orthodox jewish community and muslims etc ) but you ca n't just wave a magic wand and refuse to let people arbitrate their disputes in a reasonable manner . 
  yup by ~ # 25bn a year, 
  dependent on london is a better indicator , and very is the answer . 
  [ a third of the uk tax base is london based ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/07/london-top-taxpaying-city-uk-report ), 
  its certainly true that a stronger sterling helps importers but the trade deficit is also , more or less , a fact now as the uk de-industrialised in certain aspects and now buys foreign goods ( cars being a classic example ) . 
  the # may lose its value but the german car manufacturers would still be looking to sell into the uk - [ its their second biggest export market ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l0r9zux.png ) - you can read more in the ft [ here ] ( https://next.ft.com/content/f6cda050-20bb-11e5-aa5a-398b2169cf79 ) . 
  the prices can be readjusted and there would be some comparative loss from a weaker sterling but any kind of permanent cut off would be devastating for german industry . 
  i do n't disagree , and as a remainer brit i completely understand . 
  the problem is the eu has for the past 20 years or so had a trade deficit with the uk - [ from the ons ] ( http://imgur.com/shzpeli ) - its about [ # 25bn now ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/10/uk-trade-deficit-hits-new-record-of-24bn-pounds-eu-referendum-brexit ) and even more importantly the uk 's foreign trade balance with germany is huge , the uk is almost as important as the us and much more so than france - [ right hand column ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/factsfigures/nationaleconomyenvironment/foreigntrade/tradingpartners/tables/orderrankgermanytradingpartners.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) - therefore almost by definition a ` good deal ' for the eu becomes a good deal for the uk . 
  the leavers know this , * and * the tories are bastards ( if you did n't know already ) . 
  i 'm just hoping some sort of deal is reached in some magical way whereby everything remains the same but sort of outside the formal eu institutions . 
  i mean i have no idea really , im fucking stuck in tory land watching dreams of living or retiring on the continent go up in flames . 
  edit : oh and fucking andrea leadsom could become pm , which would just fuck everything up even more . 
  it wo n't be before the end of the year , whitehall is only putting the teams together now . 
  it 'll take them 3-4months to sort themselves out ( administratively ) before they even start formally looking at everything . 
   stall , wait for enough people to age out to shift the majority preference , done . 
  avoid announcing that you are going to simply not implement it . 
  they ca n't . 
  the entire point about the referendum was that it would have settled internal tory ( and uk , hence the other parties agreeing ) turmoil for a generation - instead it blew up in their face . 
  they ca n't walk away , it was the biggest mandate in uk history . 
  they have to trigger a50 to touch base and show it happened otherwise ukip will use it as a battering ram . 
  they have to get out of ecj jurisdiction and out of the european parliament etc. 
  what they 'll probably aim for is a canada + deal , and slowly over a number of years reintroduce ` freedom on movement ' on a bilateral basis - country by country . 
  the advantage the uk has is the trade deficit with the eu is huge - and most importantly its the [ second biggest net importer from germany ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/factsfigures/nationaleconomyenvironment/foreigntrade/tradingpartners/tables/orderrankgermanytradingpartners.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) . 
  so the uk can take a deep breath , wait for some calm and talk behind the scenes . 
  the eu has said it wo n't do informal negotiations , but there are already informal discussions going on ( they ca n't * not * talk to each other about it ) at the moment both sides need uk political stability - which will happen if theresa may gets the top job . 
  if its leadsom , well , the entire thing will be fubared even more . 
  i 'm a remainer but i see this as a chance for the uk to build a more inter-government partnership with europe ; this is n't the end of the uk in europe . 
  its just a new chapter that 'll take a little while to get going . 
  there wo n't be another ( or if at all possible any more on any subject ) referendums . 
  people and politicians are sick of them . 
  they are n't part of our political dna . 
  calm down grandad . 
   hyperbolic bullshit from a fucking generation snowflaker . 
  my parents moved to belgium from the uk in 1970 and both lived and worked there . 
  took a whole 2 weeks to go through the process . 
  in my day ** forty six years ago ** things were different . 
  my uncle managed to travel the whole world in 1970 on 2 shillings and 3 pence . 
  its beyond satire innit grandad ? 
  who cares what happened in 1970 . 
   and what about those who manage to go to australia or new zealand ? 
  ... i dunno what about them ? 
  i 'm sure its far more of a pain than being able to do it visa free . 
   stop blaming the old . 
   you had the opportunity to change the outcome of the referendum yet only 27 % of generation snowflake bothered to vote remain , 64 % of the rest of your age group were too fucking lazy to bother voting at all or so fucking stupid you thought a facebook like counted . 
  harsh but fair , which is why we 're now coming up with a strategy to inch the ( broken up ) uk back into europe bit by bit . 
  [ see we have time on our side . 
  ] ( https://next.ft.com/content/2994afe4-43b0-3763-a80c-92351473496f ) the one lesson from this is if you keep tugging away at something , eventually it 'll collapse . 
  the old voted out , the young voted in . 
  the young can bide their time . 
  edit : [ ft image upload as per bot request ] ( http://imgur.com/muhsksk ), 
  the uk government only increases pensions with inflation if they 're paid within the uk , eu and a few other countries that do n't include australia or south africa . 
  the most traumatic aspect of all this is the fucking blue rinse brigade in britain has shut the door on everyone younger .
