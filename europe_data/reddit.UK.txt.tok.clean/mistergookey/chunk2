  even though it was an snp decision , the uk government as a whole generally uses individual countries ( usually wales but sometimes scotland or northern ireland ) as a testing ground for big decisions like this before rolling it out to the entirety of the uk a year or so later . 
  [ this is my favourite maverick sabre song . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/evmwgmqa4ig ) on a side note , maverick sabre has one of the most confusing accents ever . 
  half of what he says sounds irish , a quarter sounds a bit jamaican and the other quarter is a hackney london accent . 
  just * slightly * . 
  for $ 18 it 'd be a rip off without a blow job to go with it . 
  he admitted to the agency shredding them but did n't say why ? 
  makes you wonder if there 's anything else that was shredded but was kept quiet . 
  on a related note , there are still swastikas in london although only one place that i know of . 
  there 's lots of interconnected swastikas along the top of one of the entrances/exits to [ waterloo station ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2e9me.jpg ) . 
  their [ party flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/meandros_flag.svg/500px-meandros_flag.svg.png ) also looks very familiar . 
  ** ninja-edit : ** i just looked it up and the first one you said is in fact the short version of the one i posted . 
  i really do n't want to delete mine though , i 'm quite proud of myself that i typed it all !, 
  many many times . 
  i 'm not talking about the macedonian empire , i 'm talking about the original region that was called macedonia . 
  it was a region that encompasses fyr macedonia , most of northern greece , and small sections of serbia , albania and bulgaria . 
  considering that roughly half of the ancient region is in northern greece , i think it 's pretty far-fetched to say that there are no macedonian genes in modern greeks . 
  if you have a credible source for that information , please do link it to me and i 'll be happy to believe you . 
  they are n't the entirety of macedonia but the entirety of their country is in macedonia . 
  it 's like scotland , england or wales individually calling themselves britain though so i kind of see your point . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_\\ ( region \\ ) ), 
  it is but you ca n't really expect someone to pay for something they 're not taking part in . 
  sort of . 
  it 's part of the big four ( i think it 's four , maybe three ) , the group of countries that put forward the majority of the funding for eurovision . 
  if i recall correctly , it 's the uk , france , germany and russia . 
  because they put forward most of the money , they get a free pass into the finals . 
  that makes sense , the english accent she had was vaguely london-esque so i assume she got that from her dad . 
  i 've heard other swedish accents before . 
  she just sounded too english to actually be swedish so i was confused . 
  apparently the rest of reddit is n't so forgiving of my ignorance . 
  i was also watching it alone but drinking water and eating sausage rolls . 
  it 's like when a little kid has to sit at the adults table at dinner because the he had a fight with the other kids . 
  the uk is n't part of the euro and we 're in recession . 
  i assumed sweden was the same . 
  well that i did n't know . 
  upvote for correctly predicting the future . 
  who else switched the sorting to `` new '' and used the comments as a make-shift chatroom/twitter feed tonight ? 
  good luck being able to afford it !, 
  because they all have people there tonight . 
  germany just has more power than most lately , being the richest . 
  i love satw . 
  i rediscover it every now and then and catch up on the ones i missed . 
  if you 're going to be doing illegal things , one person you do n't want watching you is the entirety of europe . 
  what was it you did n't like about tonight ? 
  norwegian ? 
  edit : he said `` i used to like you europe , what the fuck is this shit ?! '', 
  oh lordi , i was wondering where you got to . 
  not anymore . 
  as long as we 're not last , it 'll be alright . 
  she sounded far more english than american . 
  is that a swedish accent ? 
  she sounds kind of english . 
  a lot of people say that , they have for as long as i can remember . 
  it 's mostly eurovision stuff for us in the uk . 
  * #eurovision * scott mills - * the guy announcing our points * * graham norton - * our presenter * * thanks belgium * san marino * moldova * malta, 
  i liked the lead singer , does that count ? 
  the highest ranking general , no less . 
  so far graham norton 's made jokes about homosexuality being illegal in azerbaijan , and the interval act being linked to both the president 's daughter and the first lady . 
  hopefully they let him leave the country . 
  that 's some dedication ... 
  15p here . 
  i wondered why i could n't place his english accent , that must be why . 
  who could actually afford to win this year ? 
  colin farrell ? 
  me too . 
  it sounds very familiar . 
  i was just going by what it said on the screen . 
  i expected to hate their song but i 'm really liking it so far . 
  it 's very stereotypically eurovision . 
  have jedward 's voices broken ? 
  oh god ... jedward . 
  i did n't like fyr macedonia 's song at first but i ca n't say no to a good guitar solo . 
  that 's alright , you 've only got a year to wait until it changes venue . 
  the german one on now has an english songwriter . 
  that 's one hell of frown she 's got on her . 
  i was wondering that too . 
  unless one of them is planning on invading armenia ... 
  those turkish guys looked a bit creepy ... 
  haha in a good way or a bad way ? 
  i missed the uk entry , what did people think of it ? 
  was it any good ? 
  i do n't know exactly how large the percentage is . 
  i have n't seen the information that i 'm guessing -- heisenberg -- has seen so i ca n't accurately say . 
  i 'd expect it 'd be proportional to the amount of money they currently make . 
  because at the moment it 's part of the uk and therefore some of the debt is theirs . 
  if they choose to become independent , they are n't awarded a `` get out of jail free '' card . 
  if she had placed the pin ( or whatever it was ) somewhere else in germany , the title would be `` merkel does n't know where berlin is '' . 
  i think where she placed it is over the russian border . 
  yup . 
  we were in a recession , then we were kind of coming out of it , now we 're back in again .

  not sure who downvoted you without answering your question so i 've brought you back up to 1 . 
  englebert humperdinck is the man who sang [ release me ] ( http://youtu.be/rczo9xeya8g ) . 
  it 's a good song and everything but he 's a bit past his time . 
  his last time in the top 10 of the uk charts was 1969 . 
  his last time within the top 50 was 1979 . 
  oh god , i totally forgot about them . 
  i clearly need to get some friends from the lgbt community , because that sounds pretty awesome . 
  oh , we know we did something to make no one like us but we just have no idea what it is .
