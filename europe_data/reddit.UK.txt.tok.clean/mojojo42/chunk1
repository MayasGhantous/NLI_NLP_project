you brush off scottish debt by comparing it the uk 's , but scotland would not be able to borrow money at the same rate as the uk . 
  mood 's has projected an independent scotland to be ranked on the same credit level as mexico . 
  not just mexico ( with their delicious tacos ) , we 'd be [ on a par with botswana ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scotland-s-credit-will-be-on-par-with-botswana-1-3396159 ) too !, 
  ( or estonia , slovakia , and israel - but they do n't sound quite as scary )  also , leaving a currency union up to chance hoping it 's not `` cast-iron '' is a huge gamble . 
  why would the tories suddenly change their minds when their opposition to join a monetary union could n't be stronger and when joining would hurt the uk 's credit rating ? 
  i think it 's fair to say that both sides are holding their firmest line prior to the referendum itself . 
  salmond says there will be a currency union , cameron says there wo n't be . 
  you 're not going to hear anything different from them until after the vote . 
  if the vote is a yes then i think it 's quite likely the story will change . 
  the uk wants scotland to take its share of the uk 's national debt and wants a longer withdrawal programme for trident . 
  scotland wants a currency union and has said trident will be removed asap and wo n't be a bargaining chip . 
  i think it 's pretty clear there 's room for manoeuvre on both sides - both will give up some aspect of something they 're currently opposed to , because both will benefit from doing so . 
   has n't the euro crisis highlighted the dangers of currency unions in the absence of fiscal ones ? 
  no , i do n't think so . 
  the eurozone crisis is primarily about debt , and the fact that stupendously large commercial debt was converted to sovereign debt ( plus a whole host of other factors , like ireland offering `` unlimited '' protection for savings ) . 
  the same situation could have arisen even if we were still using national currencies . 
   by declaring independence and maintaining the pound sterling , scotland would transfer its entire power to influence monetary policy to england . 
  by england you mean ruk , and actually the boe not the uk government ( the boe are legally required to act independently from the uk government . 
  scotland 's influence on them would be minimal , as it is today , as their primary concern will be to act for the benefit of the ( r ) uk economy . 
  that said , i do n't think there are policies they could pursue which would adversely affect scotland without also adversely affecting ruk . 
  most western economies have converged on 2 % inflation as their target . 
   i was referring to the no campaign conning jkr out of 1m when the polls still indicate that the result will still most likely be no . 
  oh , sorry , i misunderstood !, 
  that said , it 's her money so she 's free to donate it wherever she likes . 
  it does seem a bit weird that she 's donated it after the # 1.5 m spending cap started . 
  i 's unlikely that bt will actually be able to spend it all ( unless they had less than # 0.5 m left ) so i assume she 'll end up getting a big chunk of it back . 
   that 's a depressing figure that i did n't know until now !, 
  thankfully the result was a no , so everyone [ got a bullet-proof vest ] ( http://blogofguiton.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/say-no-to-the-alternative-vote-poster-hyde-tameside.jpg ) . 
  yet with all these `` threat to boycott '' stories floating around you might think there would have been one , you know , actual boycott by now ... 
   which is what i expect the result to be . 
  what a waste of # 1m . 
  the cost is estimated to be [ about # 13m ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-22014286 ) , not # 1m . 
  that 's substantially cheaper than [ some other elections ] ( http://www.democraticaudit.com/?p=3537 ) : the av referendum cost # 75m , local authority elections cost about # 40m per year , greater london authority elections cost # 20m , and general elections cost # 113m ( say # 22m a year ) . 
   the scottish economy is overly reliant on volatile oil markets and after that it 's pretty much all services . 
  the scottish economy is [ slightly more diverse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_scotland ) than that . 
  oil made up about 11 % of public sector revenue last year ; historically it 's around 18 % , or [ around # 10bn ] ( http://scotland.gov.uk/resource/0041/00415871.pdf ) . 
  by way of comparison , tourism brings in [ about # 11bn ] ( http://www.visitscotland.org/what_we_do/deliveringforscotland.aspx ) while food + drink exports [ are # 13bn ] ( http://news.scotland.gov.uk/news/food-drink-success-3ee.aspx ) . 
   for us to continue to fund the welfare state we will have to raise taxes considerably to rates similar to norway - 30 % to 45 % . 
  scotland 's spending on welfare is entirely funded by the block grant ( scotland contributes all of its tax revenue to the uk treasury , once a year the uk treasury issues a lump sum back ) . 
  scotland is currently running a deficit , by spending more than we earn , but then so is the uk . 
  in [ 2012-2013 ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/resource/0044/00446179.pdf ) scotland 's deficit was # 8.6 bn ( 5.9 % of gdp ) , compared with # 92bn ( 5.8 % of gdp ) for the uk as a whole . 
  that 's by no means out of line [ with other countries ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/government-deficit_gov-dfct-table-en ) . 
  where did you get the figure for a 30-45 % raise in taxes from ? 
   there is also no clear indication of what currency will be used . 
  our budget deficit is too high for the euro , so it 's either a reversal on us being allowed to use the pound or a new currency . 
  if we choose the pound we cede control to the boe . 
  our budget deficit does take us ( and the uk ) above the 3-3 .5 % criteria for the euro , but more significantly in the short term would be that two years membership of erm iii are also required . 
  that said , which currency we would use is perfectly clear - it would be sterling . 
  the only question is if there would be a formal currency union with the uk . 
  the uk government currently says no , but '' [ cast-iron guarantees ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/04/david-cameron-referendum-campaign-over ) '' have been made and broken before . 
  i suspect that , in the event of a yes vote , the objections in principle will be replaced with some kind of `` advisory board '' hand-waving and a longer timetable for the removal of trident . 
  `` ceding control '' to the boe means giving up control over interest rates and the money supply ( the value of sterling ) . 
  this is essentially the same as all eurozone states do with respect to the ecb , but that aside it 's difficult to see a scenario where the boe could implement policies that would be bad for scotland without also having adverse consequences for ruk . 
  15 % interest rates would be difficult for scotland , but they 'd be difficult for ruk too . 
   eu membership is n't guaranteed either , however likely and frankly i see people voting yes to `` stay '' in the eu out of fear of ukip to simply be cowards . 
  i do n't think concern over the uk 's pledge to hold an in-or-out referendum over the eu is cowardice : the conservatives have committed to one , labour is under pressure to , and both conservatives and labour are feeling the squeeze from ukip . 
  it 's true that eu membership `` is n't guaranteed '' . 
  but given that there 's no political appetite in scotland for leaving the eu the question really comes down to what the eu accession process would be , rather than any real doubt that scotland would ( continue to ) be part of the eu . 
  the scenario that 's often touted is that scotland would have to leave the uk ( and hence the eu ) before it could even consider applying to the eu . 
  there 's very little evidence to support that - there is no precedent for a country within an eu member state having an amicable separation from its parent state while wishing to continue to participate in the eu . 
  imo , the most likely solution is one that keeps the eu together ( secession from the uk and accession to the uk on the same day ) , not one that temporarily ejects part of it only to welcome it back in again shortly afterwards . 
  who would benefit from temporarily removing scotland from the eu ? 
   the far right will be beaten once more and frankly they have support up here too . 
  that 's true - ukip did receive about 10 % of the vote in scotland in the recent euro elections . 
  then again they received 27 % of the vote in england , so i think there is a difference in the level of support they have . 
   and that 's it really . 
  i would have voted the other way for a lot of other reasons and the lack of solid evidence that we could n't do it economically . 
  now it just seems like many are saying ( and have to me ) `` i do n't care how bad it is , i 'm done with this union . '', 
  my own decision to vote yes is based much more on wanting new opportunities for scotland in the future . 
  i do n't think there 's any evidence to support the idea that scotland will turn into some kind of failed state . 
  there would certainly be challenges , but about 40 % of the other countries in the eu are scotland 's size or smaller and they manage . 
   i try and not argue about it anymore but i always get roped in . 
   can you get scottish mps to stop voting on english matters ? 
  that 's something you should take up with individual parties . 
  the snp 's mps abstain from voting on english-only legislation whereas labour/ld/conservatives do n't . 
   yeah , i 'm fully aware of scotland 's political constitution . 
  my point is simply that it 's not a sovereign state . 
  sure . 
  i do n't think anyone 's claiming it is . 
  but given the referendum there 's a distinct possibility that it might be one fairly soon , so comparing scotland to existing sovereign states is n't entirely without merit . 
  maybe a better word than `` country '' would have been `` educational system '' . 
  it 's more about `` discrete group of people doing things the same way '' than sovereignty . 
   that does n't make them a country in the sense of a sovereign state . 
  the uk is a sovereign state [ formed of countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/countries_of_the_united_kingdom ) , although you can also describe the uk as a country in its own right . 
  politically scotland 's parliament was restored in 1999 with devolution , however many of its institutions have always been separate from the rest of the uk . 
  the legal system , education system , and health service have always been distinct . 
  that does n't make scotland a country in the sense of a sovereign state , but within the uk there 's no real controversy over the idea that scotland or england are distinct countries ( within a larger country ) . 
   well they 're both fanatic nationalists , i assumed they have the same xenophobia [ civic nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) is not the same as [ ethnic nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_nationalism ) . 
  yes , icm are members of the bpc ... and ? 
  being a member of the bpc does ensure third parties can review your results , but it does n't preclude you from asking leading questions or using flawed weightings . 
  e.g. , yougov and survation are also members of the bcp . 
  yet yougov asked about `` scotland leaving the united kingdom '' ( technically true , but `` leaving '' is a loaded word ) and survation used to weight their results based on the 2010 uk general election results ( before switching to the 2011 scottish parliamentary election ) . 
  from the same page . 
  however i think showing the overall range is probably more useful than a single case , otherwise i could just pick : * oct 2012 : yes 29 % , no 55 % , lead 26 % * may 2014 : yes 40 % , no 47 % , lead 7 % that said , you ca n't really compare results between different polling organisations - their results are weighted differently and several have used quite dubious prefaces . 
  e.g. , the icm poll on the 15th may 2014 asked `` thinking about the referendum on independence for scotland , do you feel comfortable or uncomfortable being asked which way you might vote ? '', 
  as the initial question - before going on to ask how you might vote . 
   polls have barely changed . 
  if anything the yes voters have gone down since the start of the campaign from your own link , the no lead has dropped from 20-26 % in 2012 to 7-12 % in may this year , while the yes share has gone from 28-37 % to 30-40 % . 
  the result is not going to be 90/10 in either direction , but 45/55 ( either yes or no ) seems quite likely ( indeed that 's pretty much the current yes/no share if you discount undecideds ) . 
  unfortunately the telegraph is an extremely anti-independence paper .
