  the spanish constitution is based on the idea of the `` indissoluble unity of the spanish nation '' , and as such they are much less keen on the idea of parts of spain unilaterally declaring secession . 
  an independent scotland would not be a new state in the sense of being a new country ; it would have new obligations , but it would inherit many of the existing relationships it entered into while it was part of the uk . 
   73 % of scots want a straight our reduction or freeze in the eu 's budget they appear to have asked 158 people in scotland . 
  i 'm not sure you can really say that `` the overwhelming majority of scots '' really say anything when you actually mean about 115 people . 
  edit : typo, 
   wait , really ? 
   people would travel to scotland then just freely travel to london . 
  people could travel to ireland today , then just freely travel to london . 
   much less wrong , and there was less riding on the figures being right . 
  the uk government 's current estimates are now [ 4 % of their previous estimates ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-33100374 ) . 
   so does that mean , since oil is unlikely to go back over $ 100 pb , english tax payers are footing the bill ? 
  yes , people in scotland do n't pay tax . 
   nice circular definition . 
  in a sense , yes , on the other hand `` race '' is not a neatly delineated concept ( at least in english ) . 
   til a nationality is a race . 
  it would be under the uk 's [ race discrimination legislation ] ( https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/discrimination/discrimination-because-of-race-religion-or-belief/discrimination-because-of-race/#h-what-is-race - ) :  race means being part of a group of people who are identified by their race , colour , nationality , citizenship , or ethnic or national origins . 
    if you are part of one of these groups and you experience discrimination , this counts as race discrimination . 
    even if you 're not part of one of these groups , it still counts as discrimination if someone discriminates against you because they think you are . 
  this is known as perceived race discrimination . 
  the snp and ukip are by no means the worse example - the conservatives got 10 times the number of votes as the greens but end up with 330 times as many seats . 
   how out of touch is scottish labour with the people they claim to represent ? 
  you live 2000 miles away in another country and you saw it coming . 
   probably because the party is n't present outside of scotland , or gets close to 0 % the former - they only stand in scotland . 
  that seems unlikely . 
  we use ams in the scottish parliament so they 've already experienced life as a minority and a majority government under a proportional system . 
  even aside from that , in every prior election fptp has caused them to be underrepresented . 
  their current position wo n't hold forever so the smart thing to do would be to push for change that 'll benefit you when your popularity subsides . 
  it 's unlikely to happen though - the conservatives and labour are against voting reform . 
  correct . 
  we vote for a local mp to represent us , not for a government . 
  the snp did well because they were the most popular candidate in a small number of seats , whereas ukip did badly because they had a lot of support throughout the country but came 2nd or 3rd in most of the places they stood . 
  historically the snp have been penalised by fptp in the same way - they would come 2nd in most seats in scotland yet win very few of them . 
  they 've been campaigning for voting reform for some time , however as a tiny party they 've never been in a position to push for it . 
  the conservatives and labour are against voting reform , the lib dems were in favour , so the most widely predicted election outcome ( lab + lib dem coalition with some form of snp support ) might have led to reform . 
  however the lib dems have utterly collapsed , labour have also lost a big chunk , and with the conservatives dead against reform it 's very unlikely that we 'll change from fptp any time soon . 
  mass killer breivik unlikely to get very far with that . 
   we are talking about a vote 2 years later , not 2 decades . 
  no second referendum has been called , so 3-4 years seems more likely . 
  in other circumstances i would tend to agree , however a huge part of the anti-independence campaign was based on the notion that voting yes would leave scotland outside the eu . 
  if you voted no because you wanted scotland to be in the eu , only to find we 're dragged out by how ruk votes , it does n't seem unreasonable to see that as a significant change in circumstances . 
   yes but it 's also undemocratic to just keep voting until one of the outcomes is met . 
  sure - as long as we also make sure that nobody ever died , nobody was ever born , and the world stays exactly as it did on voting day forever and ever . 
  if a party promises a referendum , and people vote for them , that 's what should happen . 
  if they promise it `` too often '' then people wo n't vote for them . 
  democracy is perfectly capable of punishing parties that hold referendums over and over . 
  it 's far more dangerous for today 's leaders to try and set limits on what tomorrow 's voters might want . 
   we just had that vote , there wo n't be another ever single time we have something that changes . 
  we clearly should n't have one just because it 's a tuesday , but that does n't meant we must n't have one no matter what . 
  if scotland wants a referendum then it should have one . 
  anything else is undemocratic . 
   it does n't matter the referendum was announced before the independence one took place . 
  that is incorrect . 
  back in 2014 conservatives had announced they would hold one if they won the 2015 general election , labour had announced they would not , and there was absolutely no way to predict which of them would be in power today . 
   we are now voting as a country , the outcome will be met as a country . 
  with respect to the uk leaving the eu , yes . 
  however how we vote * within * the uk is likely to have consequences of its own . 
  are you referring to polls that ignore brexit ? 
  polling in [ january 2016 ] ( http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/scotland/article1657382.ece ) and [ february 2016 ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/poll-54-of-scots-would-back-independence-following-brexit-1-4026474 ) both put support for independence , in the event of brexit , at 54 % . 
   you know , it is funny , that people in the uk attack the idea of an amalgamated europe of one superstate , and the idea of a common european identity is ridiculous . 
  but that is exactly what the uk is . 
  most people posting here with uk flair are british nationalists . 
   why not just forget the whole independence thing all together ? 
  because they believe that independence would benefit scotland more ? 
   and yet they still pushed for independence . 
  why ca n't they just work with westminster !, 
  their focus is on what they think will benefit scotland . 
  if working with westminster benefits scotland prior to independence , why would n't they ? 
   i 'll have to remember that when the snp start moaning about westminster . 
  work with them , not against them . 
  i do n't think the snp have any problem representing scotland at westminster - that was exactly [ what they campaigned on ] ( https://likearedredrose.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/stronger_for_scotland.jpg ) . 
   but he does n't agree with the idea of an eu to begin with . 
  if you 've managed to land a job with the fire service , despite disagreeing with the notion of a state-run fire service , should you not use their hose to put out the fire on your house while you 're there ? 
   just seems plain delusional welcome to ukip !, 
   why would he try and improve it if it 's something he does n't agree with ? 
  because by doing so he would benefit the uk ? 
   she was acting as an agent provocateur . 
  she was secretly acting for the turkish government to encourage someone to commit a crime ? 
   at first glance it looks pretty evenly split , but i believe the south east has a relatively higher population when compared to the rest of gb , so i guess all in all it 's leaning towards eurosceptics ? 
  pretty much , yes - here 's a [ population cartogram ] ( http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ukcartogram.jpg ) . 
  london has a population of 8.5 million , the south east is another 9 million , scotland is 5.3 million . 
  cumbria , one of the most eurosceptic areas on this map , is only 500k . 
   this is bizarre journalism . 
  the telegraph have a [ pretty shaky reputation ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/17/peter-oborne-telegraph-hsbc-coverage-fraud-readers ) at the moment . 
   that also seems absurd . 
  both are essentially voluntary civil arbitration services . 
  although described as `` courts '' , they deal entirely with civil matters ( rather than criminal ) and have no authority beyond what the participants grant them . 
  english law allows two sides in a civil dispute to nominate any third party to arbitrate between them - you can use a beth din , a sharia court , or your local veterinarian if you like . 
   it blew my fucking mind when i learned there were sharia courts allowed to operate in the uk . 
  did it blow your mind that jewish beth din courts are also allowed ? 
   perhaps i 'm being pedantic , but 8 * 0 = 0 the alcohol limit in scotland is 50mg/100ml ( 80mg/100ml elsewhere in the uk ) however the company has a self-imposed limit of 0mg/100ml . 
  in the uk `` over the limit '' colloquially means the driving limit ( as above ) . 
  it 's not clear from the article if they mean that limit or the much lower limits of the transportation industries . 
  either way his company told him he should n't be drinking at all - and he was also at least 8 times drunker than he was legally allowed to be . 
   i 've seen some snp supports say they will vote for the uk to leave in eu referendum so they can agitate for another uk referendum . 
  that would be a pretty daft thing to do , because the only way brexit would lead to a second referendum would be if scotland voted significantly * differently * to the rest of the uk . 
  if ruk votes 60:40 to leave and scotland votes 58:42 to leave then there would be no justification for a referendum due to brexit . 
  [ a similar poll by yougov ] ( http://ukgeneralelection2020.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/breakdown-of-yougov-euref-poll-for.html ) with per-country breakdown :  should the uk remain or leave ? 
    * england : remain 40 % , leave 43 %  * scotland : remain 55 % , leave 30 %  * wales : remain 42 % , leave 38 % discounting do n't knows , that gives : * england : remain 48 % , leave 52 % * scotland : remain 65 % , leave 35 % * wales : remain 53 % , leave 47 %, 
  what about it ? 
   english mp 's can not vote in the scottish parliament however .
