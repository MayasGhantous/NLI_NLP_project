  neither can scottish mps . 
   most of the folk doing it probably do n't even know great britain was founded by the kind of scotland and just assume we have been under english power for so long . 
  that the then king of scotland was able to drive a union through as a result of inheriting the english throne from his double first cousin twice removed some 300 years ago is completely irrelevant to modern politics . 
   it 's definitely a risk it 's a certainty - the strength of the three [ protected origin schemes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_united_kingdom_food_and_drink_products_with_protected_status ) are entirely due to them being part of eu law . 
   if we lose protection for wcfc then we 'd gain the ability to produce cheap domestic brie , prosciutto , camembert , black-forest ham etc. 
  we could certainly produce it however selling it is a different matter . 
  there 's a reason that there 's absolutely no market for brazilian `` prosciutto toscano '' or moroccan `` scotch whisky '' , and it 's not that those countries are incapable of manufacturing it . 
   when you are in the uk look for west country farmhouse cheddar , that is the protected version that ca n't be made cheaply and poorly overseas . 
  ironically that protected geographical indicator status will be one of the things we 'll lose due to brexit . 
   what the hell is a european citizenship ? 
  pay $ 250 a year and , if you 're a member of a former eu state , you can retain freedom of movement . 
  ( $ 250 is pulled out of the air of course but that 'd be about the uk 's current annual contributions to the eu per person without accounting for eu spending on the uk )  do your children inherit it ? 
  can anyone acquire it with a formal process ? 
  are international waters your home ? 
  if they are a citizen of a former member . 
   or is it something they pulled out of their ass ? 
  yes . 
   if uk citizens want to live in eu they could ask to become citizens of their country of residence . 
  i suspect the thinking behind this kind of initiative is to make that transition easier . 
  well , that and annoy brexiteers . 
   yet seem to get special considerations nevertheless thanks to the vocal minority who do . 
  gay people do not get `` special considerations '' . 
  they get equal treatment . 
   rather than debunking , better call it a disagreement over the impact of new regulations . 
  perhaps try [ another one ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/brussels-has-not-banned-balloons-but-existing-rules-that-could-save-kids-lives-remain/ ) : * daily telegraph : `` children to be banned from blowing up balloons , under eu safety rules '' * daily mail : `` brussels bans toys : party blowers and other stocking fillers are barred in eu safety edict '' * daily express : `` now euro killjoys ban children 's party toys '' [ or another ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/eu-asks-women-about-their-sex-lives/ ) : * daily express : `` women could be asked intimate details about their sex lives in a planned eu census '' * metro : `` women are being told to claim they are virgins if intrusive census proposals are agreed by brussels '' * daily mirror : `` a census demanding details about women 's sexual partners is being voted on by meps today '' eu staff retire early with huge pensions . 
  corgis to be banned by eu . 
  eu workers immune from law . 
  euro meddlers rule we ca n't have milk jugs . 
  eu brainwashing children . 
  eu is targeting the sunday roast . 
  unwanted valentine 's cards to be defined as sexual harassment . 
  eu plans to rename yogurt . 
  the media are n't writing this stuff due to a `` disagreement over legislation '' . 
   it 's ridiculous that taxpayers money is being spend this way because some crazy-eyed bludgers have an over-emotional obsession with tabloid news . 
  it 's disingenuous to claim that newspapers have no impact . 
  [ they absolutely do ] ( http://www.antipope.org/charlie/pix/express-cover-montage.jpg ) . 
   is that worthwhile a mention . . [ that story produced ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/acres-outlawed-by-brussels-2/ ) : * the daily telegraph : `` rolling acres are outlawed by brussels '' * the sun : `` eu meddlers sneak in a ban on our historic land measure '' * daily express : `` now the eu is to ban the acre '' * daily mail : `` after 800 years , the acre is history '' * the times : `` brussels , stay off our little patch of land '' the point is that five uk newspapers conjured up an anti-eu story out of nothing . 
  and have been doing so 2-3 times a month , every month , for the last 24 years . 
   wait , why do they call them racist attacks ? 
  we are the same race ... ( are n't we ? ), 
  because the uk 's [ racial discrimination legislation ] ( http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/racist_and_religious_crime/ ) has a fairly wide definition :  a racial group means a group of persons defined by reference to race , colour , nationality ( including citizenship ) or ethnic or national origins . 
  on the face of it this might seem to be overly broad ( irish people are not a `` race '' ) . 
  however it ensures offences such as [ incitement to racial hatred ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incitement_to_ethnic_or_racial_hatred#united_kingdom ) can be applied equally regardless of the intended target ( provoking hatred of nigerians is treated exactly the same provoking hatred towards mexicans , italians , or the irish ) . 
   if she 's attempting to undermine the government 's position . 
  that 's * exactly * what she was asked , not `` what was really being asked '' . 
  it does n't sound particularly like she 's trying to undermine it . 
  in her view the uk government does n't have a position . 
  perhaps she 's wrong , and maybe they do have one . 
  if that 's the case then apparently it 's not one they 're willing to share with the eu , parliament , the other governments within the uk , or even the electorate . 
   that 's a great way to side step what was really being asked . 
  what was really being asked ? 
   but your range of examples is much better in making clear that it 's not just the tabloids . 
  i had to drop a couple of those links because the modbot deleted my post due to the images being on tumblr or somewhere , but if you google the non-image headlines they are all genuine front pages . 
   the thing is that most people inside the uk , even remainers , do n't ever realise just how much their picture of the eu is being distorted . 
  definitely . 
  it 's so bad that the ec even have a page on their site specifically for [ uk euromyths ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/ ) ... 
   yes she 's stupid , that 's how she became leader of one of the most powerful countries in the world . 
  she is n't stupid , but she became leader of the uk because 329 conservative mps voted her leader of the uk . 
  she has yet to fight an election as prime minister , and review her competition at the time : * liam fox : largest claimant in 2009 expenses scandal , forced to resign in 2011 after giving a friend access to ministry of defence documents and allowing him to accompany him on official overseas trips . 
  * stephen crabb : who absolutely nobody had heard of , other than his internship at a christian organisation who believes gay people can be prayed straight . 
  * michael gove : one of the main instigators of brexit , infamous for claiming that people are '' [ sick of experts ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/10/michael-goves-guide-to-britains-greatest-enemy-the-experts/ ) '' , completely unprepared for actually winning , who then stabbed boris johnson in the back in an attempt to become leader . 
  * andrea leadsom : where to start . 
  allegedly lied about her pre-political jobs and responsibilities , claimed that she would be a better prime minister than may because she was a mother and may was n't , claims that men should n't be hired to work with children because `` we know paedophiles are attracted to working with children '' , failed to publish her tax returns after promising to do so , and quite keen on rolling back gay marriage . 
  may won the leadership because fox was forced to resign in disgrace , crabb is a nobody , gove thinks he 's living in game of thrones , and leadsom is a nutjob . 
  may , quite wisely , largely kept her mouth shut and let her competitors destroy themselves . 
   however , to take an obstructive stance in brussels ... ... is music to brexiteer 's ears . 
  what the stance is even about simply does n't matter to them . 
   it may in fact be meaningful in negotiations with eu so a huge risk oh , for sure - it 's not going to win the uk any more friends within the rest of the eu . 
  it makes a certain sense if may is already aiming for a hard brexit ( which i think she is , not just from this ) . 
  if you go for a hard brexit then being obstructive does n't lose her anything during negotiations , it gets her better press at home , and it helps prepare your story for the post-brexit world . 
  if by some miracle brexit goes well then she takes the credit . 
  if , as expected , brexit goes badly then she needs to be able to deflect that blame somewhere as she has uk elections in 2020 and 2025 . 
  leaving the eu on a `` see , it was just * impossible * to work with them '' note makes it far easier to sell the idea that the uk 's problems are because the eu fucked us over . 
   really ca n't see why the uk govt would do this for any reason except to annoy the eu , but ca n't figure out why it 's helpful for them to do that . 
  it 's purely for building up domestic capital at home . 
  may became prime minister immediately after the referendum so she has had no chance to demonstrate her authority on any other issues . 
  shaking your fist at the eu always plays well at home , regardless of how meaningful it actually is . 
   do you really believe scotland will leave ? 
  yes , i think it is inevitable . 
  scotland and ruk are simply heading in different political directions . 
  the feeling that it 's now a question of `` when '' rather than `` if '' is pretty widespread . 
  polling last year showed that 70 % of scots thought it was now inevitable as did 60 % of the rest of the uk . 
   from what i 've read even pro scot-xit wanted to do things like stay in the internal uk market and keep the pound . 
  it seems impossible that this would happen . 
  nobody can predict the future , of course , but you can point to examples - greenland and denmark say - where quite unusual arrangements can be made to work . 
   sharing a currency if you do n't share a government is a bad idea , just look at the eurozone . 
  i think most of the eurozone 's problems stem from the financial crisis . 
  a global financial crisis less than a decade after the eurozone started was pretty unfortunate timing . 
  one of the most critical problems the eurozone has is the fact that commercial debt has essentially been shifted to sovereign debt . 
  in the past that would have been solved by devaluing the currency - which the eurozone prevents . 
  but it 's worth remembering that devaluation is not some kind of magic wand . 
  that the eurozone prevents it is , imo , a good thing . 
   without eu membership scotland will be a small country with little ability to assert itself internationally . 
  i do n't think scotland really feels the need to `` assert itself internationally '' . 
  the uk has had a post-empire obsession with remaining a world power , which has led us to take some very unfortunate decisions . 
   with the eu you guys will probably have to erect barriers to trade with the ruk , because the brexiteers want to leave the single market . 
  both of those are really bad outcomes . 
  that situation will also be faced by ireland of course . 
  i 'm optimistic that a solution will be found there that does n't damage either ireland or northern ireland , and that the same solution could be applied to scotland . 
   however unpleasant it might be to share your country with the english , i think that it is better than drawing new borders .
