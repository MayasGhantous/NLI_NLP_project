  just do everything you can to preserve your culture and maintain your separate identity , but that is actually doable within a federation , just ask the swiss who have done that for centuries . 
  i do n't have any problem whatsoever in sharing an island with england however i do n't feel that we `` share a country '' . 
  externally the uk is a unitary state , however internally it has always been considered a union of distinct countries . 
  scotland has always had a separate legal system , education system , healthcare , police , local government , etc. 
  if you were referring to english people living in scotland then i have absolutely no problem with that either . 
  anyone who wants to should feel free to move up and escape some of the brexit lunacy . 
  indeed many english people who lived in scotland in 2014 were campaigning for independence too - scottish nationalism is [ civic nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) and where you come from is completely unimportant . 
  the question of federalisation ( `` devo-max '' we call it ) has been raised over and over for scotland . 
  it was by far the most popular choice before the 2014 referendum ( polling at around 66 % i think ) , which is why it was explicitly * not * one of the choices in the 2014 referendum . 
  if the uk threw its weight behind federalising then that would absolutely undercut the desire for independence . 
  but i have no expectation that they will . 
  doing so would require westminster to diminish its own power , something that historically it has fought against at every step . 
  by way of example , during the 2014 referendum scotland was promised that `` we 're going to be , within a year or two , as close to a federal state as you can be '' ( gordon brown , former labour prime minister ) or that scotland would have `` one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world '' ( david cameron , former conservative prime minister ) . 
  surprisingly enough , neither of those have come to pass . 
   the man who wrote this piece was n't just a journalist writing for a domestic audience though . 
  he was involved with the yearlong negotiations with politicians all across the eu . 
    ...   whatever bias the uk journalists have , i do n't see what it has to do with politico.eu . 
  oh sure , by `` the uk media '' i meant that korski 's approach has been shaped by that - not that politico.eu was indulging in it . 
  it is difficult to understate just how vociferously anti-eu the uk media has been . 
  going back decades , but particularly since the mid-2000s . 
  the year or so up to 2009 was a frenzy of speculation about the extreme-right [ bnp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_national_party ) becoming popular . 
  they crumbled at election time and ukip pretty much took their place in the media spotlight . 
  ukip never really achieved a breakthrough at elections but they became significantly more popular than bnp ever were and got 13 % of the vote in 2015 . 
  they have also been far more astute than the bnp ever were about turning the conversation to europe . 
  the bnp were essentially your standard racist fascists , ukip had notable racists within it but the party itself ca n't really be described as such . 
  by way of explanation a voter saying `` i vote for bnp '' would get the same reaction as saying `` i 'm a racist '' , one who said `` i vote for ukip '' was often just saying `` i do n't approve of the eu/migration/etc '' . 
  the tabloids in particular [ have been ridiculous ] ( http://wordpress.mediatel.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/daily-express.jpg ) . 
  now remember that these front pages are just from one paper , and just on migrants , and there are about three such papers pumping out similar stories about the eu several times a week . 
  europe speaks german now !, 
  who * will * speak for england ? 
  eu brainwash our children !, 
  enough is enough mr cameron !, 
  day we stood up to europe !, 
  french to let migrants head for britain !, 
  these are [ all real headlines ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=daily+mail+eu&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch ) . 
  the reputable papers are frankly not much better . 
  `` boris : how eu wants a superstate , as hitler did '' , '' [ latest blow to uk sovereignty ] ( http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/telegraphh_front.jpg ) '' , `` why britain should say no to eu '' , `` eu army plans kept secret from voters '' . 
  these are front pages of the times and the telegraph , not some supermarket tabloid . 
  politicians are their own people of course but they are also shaped and led by the media . 
  cameron/etc are not idiots , and i expect on some level they do realise that what they are asking for is simply incompatible with what everyone else in the room wants . 
  but they have to ask ( because that 's what gets reported back home ) and analysis like this has to get written somewhat guardedly ( because it 'll also get discussed back home ) , so there are limits on their ability to manoeuvre if they want to be re-elected . 
  i think cameron 's renegotiation in february was basically his last roll of the dice . 
  what he got was pushing uk special treatment to breaking point for the rest of the eu , and here 's how it got reported in the [ tabloids ] ( https://anaemiconabike.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/capxurww0aaen7g.jpg ) ( this is a reference to [ dad 's army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dad%27s_army ) , a wwii comedy where the arrows are hitler trying to invade the uk ) and the [ serious media ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efb045613da2ab56355b306724b56b2c6578881a/0_0_660_769/master/660.jpg?w=620&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=08bbea72caad635d2304aaf4875949c5 ) . 
  the core problem is that uk media largely frames all discussion about the eu as if it was uk vs eu , two competing single entities . 
  imo a lot of that is rooted in the uk 's obsession with germany , as if when we say `` eu '' what is really meant is `` germany 's secret plan to take over europe again '' . 
  there is no perception at all - none - that the eu is actually 28 countries all pushing in slightly different directions . 
  all roughly heading in the same place , all benefiting from that cooperation ( no matter how messy ) , and so all fundamentally better off than before . 
  i do n't know if scotland leaving will shatter that illusion for once and for all but there is a very [ exceptionalist mindset ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exceptionalism ) in the uk , particularly with regards the eu . 
   that representation of the eu and all of europe as a stationary system just waiting for some british input , that is what is the weirdest thing to me . 
  that is at the heart of how the uk media - and many politicians - see the eu though . 
  from thatcher onwards there has always been the idea that there 's `` the uk '' and `` the eu '' , where `` the eu '' is some external monolithic entity like the usa . 
  i do n't think it is purely due to being on an island - ireland is geographically further away from the continent than mainland uk and yet they have a far less adversarial view of the rest of the eu . 
   they were n't asked to consider remain/leave for the eu referendum - they came up with new phrasing themselves . 
  ah , interesting - til , thanks !, 
   the point i was making was that the snp were laughably wrong with their prediction of scotland 's oil wealth , scots were told it was 10x more than what it actually is . 
  and the uk government had to [ cut their own forecasts by 94 % ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-34926904 ) . 
  that said , one thing many people miss is that a vote for independence is not a vote for the snp . 
  i , like many , wo n't be voting for them after independence . 
   the last question was determined by the electoral commission , i think the next one would be too . 
  if their thinking on yes/no questions has changed , it would be unusual for them not to apply that the next time they are asked . 
  in both cases the question and answers are suggested by the government and then reviewed by the electoral commission . 
  the electoral commission do n't have a built-in preference for `` yes/no '' or `` leave/remain '' , they 're considering the question + answer that has been suggested to them . 
  the draft independence referendum bill uses the exact same question + answer as 2014 . 
  as such the electoral commission are not going to say that both question + answer should switch to leave/remain simply because that 's what they were asked to consider for the eu referendum . 
   i would n't be surprised if a second scottish referendum was leave/remain ( or possibly leave/stay , as some thought remain was clunkier than leave ) . 
  i 'd be extremely surprised if it was changed . 
  the act of changing the question , after the previous question was agreed to be fair , is itself an act with meaning . 
   whilst evaluating the wording of the eu referendum they decided that yes/no was likely to influence the outcome ( yes is positive , and that helps whatever the question ) . 
  they decided that leave/remain was more neutral . 
  the electoral commission also decided that yes/no was neutral in the scottish independence referendum . 
  that the answers were changed to remain/leave in the eu referendum was because the question was also changed . 
   good . 
  i 'm all for letting scotland decide it 's fate , but they did that already . 
  they also voted for a scottish government back in may whose manifesto included :  we believe that the scottish parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option of a majority of the scottish people -- or ** if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014 , such as scotland being taken out of the eu against our will ** . 
   the scots wo n't leave , not after realising that the snp had lied about everything in the last referendum campaign , especially the value of the oil . 
  oil is eventually going to run out - is the only possible window for scottish independence the 70 year period when oil was being extracted ? 
  this is a long article , but was written by one of david cameron 's former special advisors . 
  tldr ; misjudged the mood both at home and within the rest of the eu, 
   what does this mean ? 
  residing in scotland for t amount of time at the time of the referendum ? 
  yes . 
  there 's an annual electoral register that tracks who 's allowed to vote in what . 
  if you 're an eu citizen resident in scotland then you 're allowed to vote in local government and scottish parliamentary elections . 
  you 're not allowed to vote in uk parliamentary elections , you were n't allowed to vote in the eu referendum , but you were ( and will be ) allowed to vote in the scottish independence referendum . 
  which makes perfect sense to me . 
  freedom of movement means you are able to move to another country and make it your home without taking up citizenship , and as such you should have a say in the direction of that country . 
   you can by cheap whiskey just now that is n't made in scotland , but most people still prefer the real deal though a big part of how people tell it 's the real deal is that it 's sold specifically as * scotch whisky * . 
  if i buy welsh lamb or prosciutto di parma then i know that 's exactly what i 'm getting . 
  that 's only true for one of them post-brexit . 
   england and scotland are not so similar politically . 
  which becomes [ even more striking ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/20160627_thefinaltally.jpg ) if you consider the eu vote . 
   the eu would take them back for the single reason to keep scotch supply within the single market . 
   one of the annoying consequences of brexit is that scotch will lose its protected geographical indication status . 
  so if you want to make `` scotch whisky '' out of vodka and teabags , somewhere in an industrial estate north of bucharest , then you 'll be perfectly free to do so . 
   it 's also worth considering that the previous referendum was just two years ago . 
  people have now heard all of the arguments and witnessed all of the campaigning . 
  it 's also worth considering that witnessing that campaigning is what led to scottish labour 's collapse in 2015 and snp membership rising to 3 % of the population . 
   legal adulthood ? 
  the age of legal capacity is [ 16 in scotland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_legal_capacity_ ( scotland \\ ) _ act_1991 ) ( 18 elsewhere in the uk ) . 
   it could be but it would still be an affluent large western european country of 56 million ; hardly the end of the world i think you 'll find that scottish independence '' [ would be cataclysmic for the world ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/10751728/scottish-independence-would-be-cataclysmic-for-the-world-ex-nato-head-warns.html ) '' .
