  if scotland were ever to leave the uk then the heavens themselves would split asunder , dooming the entire human race . 
   no , the polls show that not only do more scots prefer to be in the uk than in the eu , the latest scottish indy polls also show that there is n't a big appetite for independence . 
  however that polling has , for reasons unexplained , decided to use the eu referendum 's remain/leave question rather than the independence referendum ( and all subsequent polling ) 's yes/no question . 
  there was a majority polling for independence in the immediate aftermath of brexit , however since then things are returned to exactly where they 've been since 2014 . 
  i do n't think you 'll see much movement on that before we find out what shape brexit is going to take . 
  not triggering a50 or efta would likely stall any referendum , a hard brexit would likely accelerate it . 
  yes , possibly . 
  virtually all talk of `` destroying my country '' comes from outside scotland though - within scotland the debate ( even amongst many no voters ) is often more about what 's best for scotland . 
   it 's safest to just argue based on the merits of the argument , not the person making the argument . 
  then you do n't have to keep up with the political leanings of various posters . 
  a worthy goal , but res-tagging is surprisingly useful to tell when someone is being sincere vs shitposting . 
   they 're just going to go with lies `` they 're just going to go with '' is perhaps a bit strong for the education minister expressing his opinion that sterlingisation is a possibility at a fringe meeting at their party conference . 
  he was the finance minister back in 2014 , but this is no longer 2014 . 
   i 've never voted ukip , and nor will i in the future . 
  huh , my mistake - maybe it 's whatshisfacehitler i 'm thinking of . 
   i 've already heard some daft quotes from cleese , he does n't seem like a man from the world . 
  never sure whether he 's satirical or not though some from the uk have told he he sadly is n't . 
  yes , in this case he 's absolutely serious ( unfortunately ) . 
  one of the unexpected downsides of social media it seems - people you thought were intelligent or interesting turn out to be total plumbs . 
   they lost their majority in the 2016 holyrood elections , they are governing as a minority govt - and those elections only had a 55 % turnout . 
  the scottish parliament uses ams ( or mmp as it 's known in europe ) . 
  a majority is the exception under ams , not the rule as it is under fptp . 
  it 's worth noting of course that the scottish greens are also in favour of independence , so there is in fact a pro-independence majority in parliament . 
  as it happens the turnout this year was 56 % , up 5 % from 2011 . 
  the turnout in the uk 2015 election was 66 % . 
   they could try to make their own currency that 's pegged to the euro from the start i think that 's quite likely this time round . 
  last time the argument became a yes/no war of words over `` we 're using the pound '' , `` we wo n't let you '' , `` yes you will '' . 
  this time round i can see the scottish government simply saying we will create a scottish pound that 's pegged to sterling - just as ireland did with the punt for 50 years or denmark still does with the krone/euro . 
  you will hear claims that this option is impossible because it needs enormous foreign currency reserves to make it feasible , but danish-level reserves would be easily attainable . 
  ( the argument then often shifts to `` ah , but it 's scotland , you 'd need more because everyone hates you '' at which point you can safely give up ), 
   i feel like you understand the ramifications of scottish independence better than most scots . 
  i 'm not sure a leaving-voting ukip supporter from the south east * necessarily * has an objective viewpoint . 
   to help you out here in the future : all those ascension requirements are legal harmonization requirements . 
  you pass a law , you put it into effect , it 's tested if it 's fit for purpose and you 're done . 
  exactly . 
  and that step has already been carried out for scotland - the uk transposes eu legislation twice when it implements it as internally it has two entirely distinct legal systems . 
   edit , expansion : also , eurozone and schengen actually have very strict economic , budgetary , security and border control requirements you have to work for . 
  the anti-scottish independence narrative has a couple of well-worn tropes at this point : * you 'll fail the criteria to join the eu ( conflating eurozone criteria with eu criteria ) * even if you did pass , spain would still veto ( conflating unilateral secession with mutually agreed ) * even if spain did n't veto , which they will , brussels will force you to use the euro ( all other currency is confiscated , naturally ) * even if spain did n't veto , which they will , and brussels force you to use the euro , which they will , you wo n't even be allowed to use the euro ( the foaming at the mouth normally commences here ) the eu is simultaneously pitched as either something exclusive that scotland could never dream of participating in , or something nightmarish that scotland is being protected from . 
  both of which scotland is only fortunate enough to enjoy/avoid due to good will and graces of the uk of course . 
   scotland 's tax rates are n't that limited - their taxes are much higher than the rest of the uk . 
  scotland 's tax rates are exactly the same as the rest of the uk .

  [ redditor delivers ... ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/odd/alex-salmond-features-on-a-new-two-smackeroonie-coin-1-4222581 ), 
   while i 'm not saying scotland should n't be paying for them , i 'm surprised no one has been a more realistic version using numbers from ireland/portugal/denmark to give a better post-independence estimate of the actual deficit . 
  the scottish government does not have the power to obtain that information and the uk government has no interest in obtaining that information . 
  which is n't to claim conspiracy , it 's simply how things are . 
  a good example is estimating how many of scotland 's exports are to ruk vs elsewhere . 
  the best figure we have is about 64 % , however the uk does not track intra-uk trade at all . 
  the source of that estimate is a voluntary survey that the scottish government send out to businesses which they 're under no obligation to return , or to return correctly . 
  that 's better than nothing but it 's very much an approximate upper bound - which the survey 's authors state quite explicitly . 
   i basically grew up learning my english from monty python   ...   those feelings have been virtually sapped away by the unbelievable crap of the last 10 years . 
  [ speaking of which ... ] ( https://twitter.com/johncleese/status/782691995034722304 ) for context a tenement is a type of scottish building historically occupied by poorer scots . 
  ( the @daftlimmy account replying to him is a scottish comedian trying to bait him into retweeting him , which of course cleese did before doubling down and claiming that it was n't casual racism it was '' [ considered culturalism ] ( https://twitter.com/johncleese/status/782696016025948161 ) '' ), 
   you should probably tell that to all of the people who doubt that scotland would easily get into the eu . 
  i 'd be happy to have that discussion with them - particularly if they 're not about to leave themselves . 
   i do n't think we 'll get anywhere debating on three vague bullet points . 
  of course , hence my hope you would provide something substantive . 
   scotland 's situation would change dramatically upon leaving the uk and would fall out of meeting certain areas of the acquis . 
  which ones ? 
   and that 's assuming spain did n't veto them . 
  i do n't think spain has any interest in vetoing a mutually agreed secession . 
  their objection has always been , as it was with kosovo , to unilateral secession . 
  it 'll be interested to see if spain decides to veto the uk 's brexit agreement due to gibraltar though . 
   i will not be debating every single requirement with you because frankly , i ca n't be bothered . 
  but feel free to study them if you like . 
  i have , thank you . 
  my suspicion is that these `` certain areas '' you allude to do not in fact exist . 
  that scotland would have to comply with the same eu requirements as everyone else is not in doubt . 
  that it already does is also not in doubt . 
   that 's a simplified outline of the criteria , to say the least . 
  in effect , those three bullet points encompass a huge number of requirements . 
  of course , nevertheless those are the broad requirements . 
   scotland fails to fulfil most of them , especially economically . 
  well there are only three core groups , so let 's take each in turn : * stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy , the rule of law , human rights and respect for and protection of minorities i do n't think there 's any suggestion that scotland is lacking the rule of law , abuses human rights , or is lacking sufficient protection of minorities . 
  perhaps you could point out some examples of areas where scotland is failing to guarantee the democratic rights expected within the eu ? 
  * a functioning market economy and the ability to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the eu that scotland has a functioning market economy is similarly difficult to question . 
  so , could it cope with the type of competitive pressures and market forces that exist within the eu ? 
  clearly , it could . 
  no country is without economic challenges , but unless your theory is that scotland would be failed state without the protective guidance of the uk then it 's hard to see why ireland or malta can cope yet scotland could n't . 
  40 % of eu members are scotland 's size or smaller . 
  some are richer , some are poorer , but none are really fundamentally different in structure from scotland . 
  * ability to take on the obligations of membership , including the capacity to effectively implement the rules , standards and policies that make up the body of eu law ( the ` acquis ' ) , and adherence to the aims of political , economic and monetary union . 
  given that scotland is already compliant with the acquis , by virtue of its current presence within the eu as part of the uk , this also seems pretty straightforward . 
  the united kingdom has two internal legal systems , scots law and english law , and eu legislation is transposed twice when implemented by the uk . 
  there are no aspects of eu law which scotland is not already compliant with . 
  if there were then , by definition , the uk would not be compliant either . 
   e.g their public spending deficit is far too large . 
  scotland received borrowing powers for the first time last year . 
  the maximum deficit that scotland can run under that arrangement is # 300m . 
  talk of `` scotland 's # 15bn deficit '' is actually referring to scotland 's share of the uk 's deficit . 
  that was run up as a result of the financial crisis , not public spending . 
  the uk 's deficit ballooned from # 20bn in 2005 to # 50bn in 2009 , then # 103bn in 2010 . 
  that aside , the eu accession criteria have no deficit limit as such ( beyond the requirement for a functioning market economy ) . 
  you may be thinking of the eurozone convergence criteria ?

   indeed . 
  based on its current economy , scotland does not fulfill many of the requirements to become an eu member which of the [ copenhagen criteria ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/accession_criteria_copenhague.html ) does scotland not fulfil ? 
   i do n't agree with saying no to scotland as necessarily saying no to democracy . 
  as we saw with brexit , britain is actually very good at following what the public wants but you ca n't hold a referendum for everything . 
  oh , absolutely .
