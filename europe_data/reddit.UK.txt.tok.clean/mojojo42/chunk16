  probably best not to use that one . 
    either way , it 's significantly greater . 
  yes , although clearly neither will fall to zero even in the event of a hard brexit . 
  if the uk wants to trade with the eu at all it will need to comply with eu regulatory tariffs , and any fiscal tariffs will happen equally to ireland ( and others ) as much as scotland . 
  trade from scotland to ruk might drop slightly ( 1 % ? 
  but you can see that either as a problem or an opportunity . 
   64 % is a lot . 
  that 's a little under double the amount of uk  eu trade . . 
  the [ uk figure is 44 % ] ( https://fullfact.org/europe/uk-eu-trade/ ) . 
  i 'm not sure what `` a little under double '' is meant to mean . 
  it 's exactly half way between the uk-eu figure and double the uk-eu figure so ... ? 
   i think the majority of scottish are probably willing to see the outcome of the negotiations before voting again , as they will be out of the eu regardless if they were to end up voting for independence from uk . 
  i disagree that scotland would be out of the eu regardless . 
  there is still sufficient time for scotland to vote to leave the uk and transition into the eu before brexit concludes . 
  it is increasingly looking like the uk is going for the hard brexit option so i do n't think scotland needs to wait for that to play out before making a decision . 
  if someone sets your house on fire you do n't need to wait for it to burn to the ground before doing something about it . 
   however having voted to remain part of the uk in 2014 it is not unreasonable to expect scotland to respect the decision to leave the eu in a uk wide referendum , if they cant , then its right they go . 
  the promise that voting no would keep scotland in the eu was a key part of the 2014 referendum . 
  that is one of the reasons why the disparity between scotland/england in the [ brexit referendum was so clear ] ( https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mn6xl_xbxpkfrgtfvh03pq--/yxbwawq9aglnagxhbmrlcjtzbt0xo3c9odaw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-gb/homerun/snappa.uknews/197fd3a3cd6c01807f18ae45a7a05ad5 ) . 
  the argument against leaving has shifted at each stage : * 2014 , you ca n't vote yes or [ scotland will be out of the eu ] ( https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584 ) * 2016 , you ca n't vote now because maybe brexit will be fine * 20 ? 6 , ok , brexit was shit , but it 's too late to vote now i think it 's obvious that a hard brexit will be a colossal mistake for the uk . 
  i see no reason why scotland should have to wait for that all to play out to realise that , yes , brexit was a colossal mistake . 
   personally i do n't think they 'd vote yes because of the uncertainties or rather impossibilities of negotiating an exit from a union that itself is exiting another union . 
  i think the difficulty of conducting parallel negotiations is somewhat overblown tbh . 
  remember that scotland has a completely separate legal system from the rest of the uk ( and education , health , local and central government , etc ) . 
  when eu legislation is transposed for the uk it is transposed into both scots law and english law , and indeed the legislation that created the scottish parliament explicitly requires it to act in accordance with eu legislation . 
  which is not to say that a scotland-in-uk-in-eu to scotland-in-eu transition would be automatic , nor without some work , but i think it is quite possible - it is a situation without precedent but it is also a situation where all parties are aiming for the same goal . 
  bear in mind that the bulk of the brexit negotiations are not going to be about actual legislation , they are going to be agreeing a process * for * future legislation . 
  may has explicitly endorsed this with her plan for a `` great repeal bill '' , whereby the uk will commit to all eu legislation at the point of brexit and then re-legislate to undo them one-by-one in the coming decades . 
   scotland would have to leave the uk , leave the eu ( which they are doing anyways ) then rejoin the eu . 
  i think it 's extremely unlikely that spain would require scotland to leave the eu prior to joining . 
  placing scotland outside the eu would have no benefit to anyone ( it would be a smaller-scale version of brexit , for what end ? 
  ) , but would lose spanish fishing fleets their cfp-based right to fish in the north sea . 
  spain has one of the largest fishing industries in the eu , much of that fishing is done in uk/irish waters , and the uk portion of that is shortly to shrink by about half due to brexit anyway . 
   190k votes is a lot of votes in a country of just 5.3 m. 
  it would be about a 5 % swing . 
  which is not nothing , but a far better starting point than before . 
   uk will never allow this the uk government have always been quite open that they would - scotland is not some kind of prisoner within the uk . 
   in theory that 's exactly how democracy should function . 
  but let 's be honest , nobody reads party manifestoes . 
  maybe so , however this was a key talking point in the election itself . 
  it 's been their position ever since the brexit referendum was announced so i do n't think any of their voters were in much doubt what would happen if the uk voted leave . 
   scotland as an independent country would not meet eu ascension rules off the bat . 
  there can be no shortcuts to joining the eu . 
  the eu accession criteria are the [ copenhagen criteria ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/accession_criteria_copenhague.html ) : * stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy * a functioning market economy * ability to take on the obligations of membership which of those criteria would scotland not meet ? 
   the snp 's very goal is to destroy the country . 
  scotland leaving will not destroy the uk as a state any more than ireland leaving did . 
   as much as i 'd like to see scotland to remain in the eu , i do n't think independence is in scotland 's best interest . 
  the uk is a bigger trading partner for them than europe is . 
  it probably is , however be cautious of any statistics you hear about scotland 's ruk/eu trade . 
  the uk government explicitly does not track this information and so the only statistics that are available are based on a voluntary survey that the scottish government sends out to businesses . 
  there is no obligation to return it , or to fill it out correctly , and so any figures you hear should be taken with an extremely large grain of salt - as indeed the survey cautions . 
  that survey estimates around 64 % of scottish trade is with ruk , which seems about right , but you will read people claiming it 's 70/80/90 % with absolutely nothing to back it up . 
  the same was true of ireland at one point of course ; arguably scotland 's interests are best served by diversifying away from ruk and expanding eu trade . 
  it also remains to be seen exactly what trade barriers or tariffs are introduced between uk/eu post-brexit . 
  the uk is certainly going to need to comply with regulatory tariffs simply to be able to sell into the eu so i suspect the actual impact on scotland will be no worse than it will be for ireland . 
   i dont think the may govenment will give another referendum until after brexit negotiations are done , which will likley take more than 2 years the snp would absolutely love her to take that position - it would simply drive support for a referendum higher . 
  the relationship between the conservative party and scotland has been extremely rocky since thatcher and `` conservative pm tells scotland to shut up and get back in line '' plays directly into that narrative . 
   it is definitely more likely . 
  whether `` more '' is enough is another issue . 
  190k votes would have changed the result in 2014 - it was extraordinarily close even then . 
   they 've already said they 'll veto scotland entering like that , to avoid precedents for catalonia spain objects to unilateral secession - scottish independence would be by mutual agreement . 
   again ? 
  she has but one drum and never stops banging on it . 
  their 2016 manifesto promised a referendum `` if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014 , such as scotland being taken out of the eu against our will '' . 
  six months ago they were re-elected as the scottish government , with 47 % of the vote , on exactly that basis . 
   your first comment was to say so does the uk , your second was to say so does england . 
  yes ? 
  the [ link i posted in my first comment ] ( http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/campaign-for-us/tackling-childhood-obesity ) is to cancer research uk 's page on childhood obesity . 
  that says :  one in five children are overweight or obese when they start primary school . 
  worringly [ sic ] by the time they leave , that figure rises to one in three . 
  and further down :  more than 2 in 10 ( 21.9 % ) of english schoolchildren are overweight or obese when they start primary school . 
  my initial point was that the overall uk figure is one in five , you asked if that was double-counting scotland , i followed-up with the specific figure for england . 
   have to say it 's hilarious how you 're trying deflect this news to england . 
  i do n't think i 'm trying to deflect anything - it is too high in both countries . 
  the uk has a problem with obesity generally and , as the cruk say , for many it starts in childhood . 
  my point was simply that this was n't a problem unique to scotland , despite the easy stereotypes of `` they 'll deep fry anything '' and `` the stuff they eat is n't fit for animals '' . 
  the west coast of scotland in particular has a long-standing problem with mortality rates known as '' [ the glasgow effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glasgow_effect ) '' . 
  this has not really been explained satisfactorily through either deprivation or diet - neither are great , but comparable cities elsewhere in the uk do not see it . 
  that [ 1 in 4 boys born in glasgow ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/apr/16/commonwealth-games-2014-glasgow-lowest-life-expectancy-uk ) will die before they reach 65 is a tragedy . 
   would n't that just be including scotland in the figures again ? 
  the cruk calculate the figure to be 21.9 % ( slightly over 1 in 5 ) just for england . 
  worth noting that the scotland in the title is because this story was filed in the bbc 's scotland section . 
  the overall figures for the uk are actually twice as bad - cancer research uk estimate the figure is [ 1 in 5 children across the uk ] ( http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/campaign-for-us/tackling-childhood-obesity ) are overweight or obese when starting school . 
   i was under the impression most of the english media was pro remain , why are they supporting mays maximum brexit all of the sudden ? 
  i think they were split roughly half and half , however by circulation the leave papers have [ about x1 .6 the readership of remain ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/which-newspapers-support-brexit_uk_5768fad2e4b0a4f99adc6525 ) . 
  the remain-supporting papers in that article ( guardian and independent ) are editorially against the conservatives but they 're keeping that below the headline . 
  the problematic aspect , in terms of journalism , is that they are all buying into the `` may goes for the centre-ground '' message without question . 
  the reality is that she has ` shifted ' to the centre simply by redefining the centre to be where she is . 
  she can do that largely because labour , the main opposition , have been engulfed in civil war both pre and post-brexit due to much of the party membership being utterly at odds with the party 's representatives in terms of support for the party leader ( membership are pro , representatives are anti ) . 
  as such they have lost the ability to hold the government to account , and often give the impression of responding to situations a week late .

  snp won almost all of the 59 scottish constituencies . 
  sorry , that was worded badly . 
  they won 56 of the 650 westminster constituencies , which is 8.6 % of the mps , however all of those seats were in scotland . 
   it only would have looked like that with a national proportional system . 
  yes , there are a whole range of different proportional systems - and of course people 's voting habits would change too . 
  under fptp there is a very strong push at election time to `` vote for x , or your vote is wasted '' . 
  every party runs `` only party x can win here '' campaigns based on the idea that this constituency normally votes labour , if you 're hesitating between labour and lib dem then you should just vote labour because lib dems do n't have a chance .
