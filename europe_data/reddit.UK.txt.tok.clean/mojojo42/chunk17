  which is self-reinforcing , of course , because if you do n't think your party has a chance you probably wo n't bother to vote . 
  there 's far less of that under a proportional system because you know that your vote will still make a difference in the overall makeup of parliament . 
  the big advantage of ams/mmr is that it has already been used within the uk ( in scotland and in several other elections ) , and to a voter there are minimal changes - you vote for your mp exactly as you do today , and you cast one other vote for a regional mp . 
  there was a referendum on switching to av recently and the amount of misinformation spread about how complicated it would be , how costly it would be , the party with the most votes might not win , you need fptp for strong government , etc , was astonishing . 
  the best strategy for electoral reform in the uk is something that 's ( a ) better than fptp and ( b ) minimal transition from fptp . 
  once you break out of the fptp system then it 's far easier to have a further conversation in a few decades about another change . 
   i 've always thought that the point of fptp in the uk was to give more representation to regionally strong parties ( such as snp ) than to second-tier national parties ( such as ukip ) even if the total number of votes is similar . 
  oh , absolutely not - fptp was not selected by design . 
  we use it purely because it was the smallest transition from an electorate selected by land ownership ( 1400s-1800s ) to a wider franchise ( 1800s + ) . 
  after a few hundred years it has , as per [ duverger 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duverger%27s_law ) , produced a two-party system that is incredibly reluctant to change . 
  if you 're one of the big two then you support it because even if you 're kicked out for a few decades you know you 'll also be voted back in for a few decades soon enough . 
  in scotland the net effect has been that one of the big two parties tended to pass over the tipping point whereby they grabbed all the seats . 
  so the conservative & unionist party held most of scotland for about 50 years up until the 1960s , then it went to labour for about 50 years , and now it 's gone to the snp . 
  scotland has had its own parliament since 1999 that uses [ ams ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/additional_member_system ) ( essentially what germany uses as mmp ) . 
  that 's provided a very interesting comparison with fptp as you have the same voters voting for the same parties . 
  for example the conservatives have - for decades - received around 15 % of the vote in scotland . 
  fptp gave them hardly any seats in the uk parliament , ams gives them ~ 15 % of the seats in the scottish parliament . 
  similarly , the snp regularly polled 20 % of the vote . 
  fptp gave them around 8 % of the scottish seats at westminster , ams gives them around 20 % of the seats at holyrood . 
  that increased visibility is part of what led to their polling and seats increasing , as it has broken fptp 's core message of `` you have to vote for a or b , anything else is a wasted vote '' . 
  so , at the last four elections , their share of the vote ( and hence seats ) has gone from 20 % to 32 % , then 45 % , and now 46 % . 
   so it 's possible that , depending on how it 's designed , a proportional system would still give a large advantage to labour , the tories and the snp . 
  labour and the conservatives would continue to dominate uk politics for some time - the party that would gain the most would be ukip . 
  they received about 13 % of the national vote in 2015 but , because that vote was spread across constituencies rather than geographically concentrated , they received 1 seat under fptp . 
  the last election would probably have looked like this under pr : | party | vote | pr mps | fptp mps | fptp % ge | | --------- | ------ | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | | con | 37 % | 242 | 331 | 51 % | | lab | 30 % | 199 | 232 | 37 % | | ukip | 13 % | 82 | 1 | 0.2 % | | lib dem | 8 % | 51 | 8 | 1 % | | snp | 5 % | 31 | 56 | 9 % | | green | 4 % | 24 | 1 | 0.2 % | i disagree with ukip on pretty much everything but it is profoundly unrepresentative that 13 % of the population voted for them yet they have 0.2 % of the seats . 
   the new country would have started out of the eu , and spain would have vetoed entrance because of catalonia . 
  my point was that scotland voting yes to independence does not set any date for when that independence should happen . 
  it seems quite plausible that the process by which scotland would enter the eu would be one where it seceded from the uk and acceded to the eu at the same point in time . 
  none of the three parties involved ( scotland , ruk , eu ) would have anything to gain by scotland leaving temporarily only to come back in again . 
  spain 's only objection to scottish independence would be if it was done unilaterally . 
  they have no objection to countries that separate by mutual agreement . 
   snp also needs fptp unless some special provision is made to ensure representation of local parties . 
  the snp 's current share of seats would decline under fptp , nevertheless [ they would still support a proportional system ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-snp-would-vote-to-introduce-proportional-representation-at-westminster-nicola-sturgeon-confirms-10223302.html ) :  `` i believe strongly in proportional representation . 
  i believe there should be a direct relationship between the percentage of votes a party wins and the percentage of seats they win in whatever parliament the election is for , '' she said . 
    `` the polls suggest that my party might do well under fptp on thursday but i think if you believe in something in principle you should believe in that regardless of whether your party benefits from the current system . '', 
  this has been their position for the last 15 years , at least , if not longer . 
   not something we are definitely going to do which is quite different from `` not something we are going to do '' . 
   `` be clear about the proportion of their workforce which is international '' in no way constituents a workers list . 
  its a percentage . 
  correct . 
  but it is also naming and shaming companies that are insufficiently british . 
   can anyone point out in the transcript where rudd said anything about naming and shaming companies or worker lists ? 
  it never happened . 
  the comments were made after her speech - they do not appear in the speech itself . 
  [ from the bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37561035 ) :  briefing notes after her speech also suggested they could be required to `` be clear about the proportion of their workforce which is international ''   ...   asked whether she was prepared to `` name and shame '' companies which did not comply by publishing a breakdown of the nationality of their workforce , ms rudd told bbc radio 4 's today it was `` not something we are definitely going to do '' but it was `` one of the tools '' under review `` as a way of nudging people into better behaviour '' . 
    while many companies were doing a great job employing local staff , she said there were firms `` which are not so constructive and these are the ones we want to flush out '' - citing one business she knew of where 80 % of whose staff were from outside the uk . 
   i think this is just the papers going off on one trying to make something sound as bad as possible so they can create clickbate headlines , as it traditional in the uk press . 
  her controversial remarks were made on wednesday , after her speech . 
  [ at that point ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37561035 ) she wanted to `` flush out '' employers with too many non-british employees and planned to force employers to publish `` the proportion of their workforce which is international '' . 
  for anyone legally employed that proportion is already known to the government as you must have a national insurance number - or foreign equivalent - to pay income tax . 
  as such , the only motivation to make that information public is to promote naming and shaming - it would not suddenly reveal some hitherto unknown pool of eu nationals employed in the uk . 
  the purpose was to bring non-political pressure on employers to hire british workers . 
  the tabloids would have been falling over themselves to produce a league table of least british employers . 
   yes guaranteed leaving the eu , no did n't a yes vote does not create independence overnight , any more than brexit has removed the uk from the eu . 
   and we were told that oil crashing was n't likely either by ` yes ' . . we were also told that by the uk government . 
  [ they cut their oil forecasts by 94 % ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-34926904 ) shortly afterwards . 
   it was also known that there was going to be an eu referendum if the tories won . 
  that is pure revisionism : * labour had ruled out an eu referendum . 
  * the lib dems had ruled out an eu referendum . 
  * the snp had ruled out an eu referendum . 
  * the conservatives had promised to hold one if they won a majority , which nobody believed they would ( cameron had also broken his previous '' [ cast-iron guarantee ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/03/david-cameron-lisbon-treaty-referendum ) '' to hold one over the lisbon treaty . 
  the only discussion there was about the eu in 2014 's independence referendum was the claim that [ voting yes would force scotland to leave the eu ] ( https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584 ) . 
  edit : here 's the leader of the scottish conservatives , [ speaking during the independence debates ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lygrkk7mp3e ) , saying both that voting no means staying in the eu and that it 's unlikely that the conservatives will win . 
  interesting , thanks for the link !, 
   you realize it was a figure of speech right ? 
  i did not realise it was a figure of speech . 
  i thought you believed that there were only 2 foreign workers living in scotland . 
   even if that number is true ( you did not provide a source ) the [ bbc report 173k ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37105379 ) , but they do n't provide a source . 
   it 's nothing compared to england . 
  it 's about 3.2 % of the population vs [ 5 % for the uk overall ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-uk-leaves-the-eu-36745584 ) , so broadly similar in relative terms . 
  she is first minister of scotland though , rather than prime minister of the uk , so her remit only extends so far . 
   50 % support and 35 % oppose the lists in scotland . 
  have they published a per-country breakdown ? 
   but the 2 foreign workers in scotland are n't the issue . 
  there are about 180k eu nationals living in scotland . 
   that 's more than a 2:1 ratio of support for this move , and by extension shows that what sturgeon is advocating here is a significant minority position . 
  the yougov poll is of around 5000 people , however for some reason they have n't provided a per-country breakdown . 
  polls like that typically use a scottish subsample that matches scotland 's % ge of the overall population , which means any figures for scotland ( such as the breakdown for snp voters - who must be in scotland as the snp do n't stand outside ) are probably derived from 500 people . 
  that 's quite a bit below the typical sample size of 1000 so i would be wary of saying that her position was that out of sync with scottish public opinion . 
  she 's quite possibly out of sync with uk public opinion - but when it comes to scotland/ruk that 's true on quite a few subjects . 
   yeah , we should start hiring chinese people to work on our nuclear submarines programs too , after all , i 'm sure they 're trustworthy professionals . 
  we 're hiring [ french people ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/new-trident-submarines-to-be-built-with-french-steel-1-4249406 ) to make the steel for our nuclear submarine programme . 
  the [ chinese people ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-chinese-firm-to-submit-essex-nuclear-plant-plans ) are being hired for our nuclear reactor programme . 
   likewise i was happy to vote snp in the 2014 ( and 2015 ) elections and vote no to independence a few months later . 
  yep , i think it 's quite common for people elsewhere in the uk to think that things are far more rigid than they really are . 
  which i ca n't say i blame them really , as the uk media were essentially pushing that narrative . 
  there 's a bigger overlap with the snp than other parties , but i know several no-voting snp members ( felt time was n't right ) and yes-voting conservatives ( all very pro-scotland , little-englander conservatism does n't appeal to them ) . 
   this is the full text of amber rudd 's speech . 
  it is n't on any spectrum with the holocaust . 
  her controversial remarks were made after her speech . 
  [ those comments ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37561035 ) , of wanting to `` flush out '' employers with too many non-british employees or that employers must publish `` the proportion of their workforce which is international '' , are also not comparable to the holocaust . 
  but they are deeply unwise , and they are exactly the sort of language and thinking that in turn has lead multiple countries towards fascism . 
   jobs in politics and security matters require you to be a british citizen to prove that your loyalties lie with your own country when pitted against another country or entity . 
  the governor of the bank of england is a canadian . 
   how come your not an snp supporter when you want independence ? 
  pretty much every party , including the scottish conservatives , contains members or voters who support independence . 
  scottish labour were officially against independence however about [ 30 % of their membership ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/labour-candidate-claims-party-is-ignoring-30-who-voted-yes-1-4111141 ) voted yes - as did around 50 % of their traditional voters . 
  where the money went is even stranger . 
  vote leave gave # 625k [ to a 23-year old fashion student ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/vote-leave-gives-fashion-student-darren-grimes-625000-brexit-eu-referendum-beleave-a7169601.html ) , as you do , which was about $ 800k at the time . 
   if the eu 27 all agree on this all throughout negotiations then sure , it 's likely uk will be outside of single market article 50 works the other way round .
