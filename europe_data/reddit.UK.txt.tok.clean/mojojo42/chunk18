  * unless * all eu27 agree otherwise , within two years , then the uk is outside the single market by default . 
   canada , the usa , probably australia . 
  so that 's 2.5 out of 196 ? 
  i believe canada 's approach is also that the businesses are simply listed as using a particular visa programme . 
  that 's quite different from the league table approach being proposed here , where companies must indicate the percentage of their workforce that 's foreign . 
   you mean like most countries in the world ? 
  seems fine to me . 
  what other countries require businesses to publish lists of foreign employees ? 
   so , why not to start a party that promises zero net migration ? 
  or even expulsion of people without citizenship ? 
  back in 2014 ukip wanted a [ five year ban on immigrants settling in the uk ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/07/ukip-ban-immigrants-nigel-farage ) and a cap of 50k . 
  in 2015 they dropped that as an explicit policy but are aiming for around '' [ 20k to 50k ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/ukip-u-turn-on-50000-a-year-immigration-cap-10085995.html ) '' . 
  ever-increasing house prices were the uk 's national obsession from the 1990s-2010 . 
  every-decreasing immigration is the new equivalent . 
   why does the uk want to limit net migration to only 100.000 ? 
  `` oh , your party wants to allow 300k foreigners in ? 
  well * our * party will only let 100k in ! '' . 
  not much more than that .

  you guys have the most hilariously hysterical papers i 've ever seen .

   is this some kind of strategy for the brexit i do n't get ? 
  nope . 
  the last two days have included : * may : [ we 're leaving the single market ] ( http://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2016/10/02/may-speech-makes-it-clear-we-re-leaving-the-single-market ) * may : [ we 'll operate within the single market ] ( https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/783337196132634624 ) * fox : [ eu citizens are `` one of our main cards '' in negotiations ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/04/liam-fox-refuses-to-guarantee-right-of-eu-citizens-to-remain-in-uk ) * davis : [ eu citizens wo n't be used as a bargaining chip ] ( http://order-order.com/2016/10/04/david-davis-eu-citizens-wont-be-used-as-bargaining-chip/ ) * davis : [ eu referendum campaign untruths are ` not important ' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-davis-brexit-secretary-eu-referendum-campaign-lies-a7344611.html ) although , obviously , brexit means brexit . 
   could it be able to function on its own with maybe a little help from the eu ? 
  tldr ; yes . 
  wales and ni are not really in a position where they could exist independently ( nor is ni likely to ever want to - if it ever left the uk it would be to join ireland ) . 
  it was a common claim that scotland would be too poor to afford independence back in the early 1980s ( coincidentally at the [ peak of north sea production ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mccrone_report ) ) but nowadays no serious politician makes that claim . 
  the current claim is that scotland could afford it , but that there would be some unspecified amount of financial hardship involved . 
  scotland 's share of the uk 's deficit is frequently touted as proof that scotland could n't manage , however it neglects to mention that most of the uk 's deficit was run up after the financial crisis ( # 20bn in 2005 , # 50bn in 2009 , then # 103bn in 2010 ) and the scottish government only received the ability to borrow in 2014 ( and they 're capped to # 300mn ) . 
  the reality is scotland has a population of around 5 million and a gdp somewhere between ireland and denmark . 
  small countries do face challenges , but the evidence suggests most of them manage pretty well . 
  edit : scotland does receive eu funding under the structural and investment funds programme , and things like farming uplift payments ( well , [ most of the time ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24874125 ) ) . 
  most of these projects have a `` built with eu funding '' badge on them , which led to a plan to [ stick union flags on telephone cabinets ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13203873.union_jack_flags_and_slogan__funded_by_uk_government__to_be_posted_in_scotland/ ) to counteract this malign influence . 
  edit2 : britnats have arrived !, 
   what is more interesting are the reports coming in about atm outages for deutsche bank in germany . 
  there was a comment on a thread on zero hedge that said the following : db has had a series of atm outages this year ; zero hedge made the same [ insinuation back in june ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-06-03/deutsche-bank-atms-block-cash-withdrawal-due-technical-glitch ) . 
   so a possible bank run is under way . 
  or someone 's prone to clickbait . 
   scottish nationalism is built on grievances about being constantly treated as inferior to england , feeling westminster does n't represent them . 
  ( there 's more but those are the big ones ) i do n't think that 's accurate tbh ; scottish nationalism as it exists today is far more about political autonomy than about grievance . 
  even if westminster aligned perfectly with holyrood in terms of policy the motivation for many people in 2014 was self-governance . 
  that is really just as a result of the process that has developed since 1997 , when the parliament was restored , whereby the centre of gravity of scottish politics has shifted from london to scotland . 
  nobody seriously believes that scottish politicians are going to be any less crooked than politicians anywhere else . 
  however there has been a very definitive shift in mindset from `` why should scotland have its own government '' to `` why * should n't * scotland have its own government '' . 
  the normalisation of that idea is why many people , even committed unionists , feel that independence is inevitable in the long run . 
   the uk covers 13 % of the sea in the eu , but was allocated 30 % of it 's total quota . 
  so you 'd have to catch more on less sea . 
  but there 's another reason why it wo n't happen . 
  also worth considering that 60 % of the uk 's catch is landed in scotland . 
  boris commented [ on the timetable yesterday ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-brexit-talks-dont-need-to-take-two-years-10588797 ) :  `` you invoke article 50 in the early part of next year ( and ) you have two years to pull it off . 
  i do n't actually think you need to spend the full two years but let 's see how we go . 
    we are going to benefit from fantastic opportunities for free trade with our friends in the eu . 
    not only do we buy more german cars that anybody else , we drink more italian wine than everyone else - they 're not going to put that at risk . '', 
  may slapped him down shortly after but she 's going to find it very hard to prolong things beyond january . 
   what ? 
  people in the uk generally seems to like or at least tolerate fptp . 
  even by uk standards the av referendum was a [ cesspit ] ( https://cdn.opendemocracy.net/files/no-to-av-baby-campaign-005.jpg ) of a [ campaign ] ( https://dailyelection.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/no-to-av-soldier.jpg ) . 
  that was a referendum that av lost , not one that fptp won . 
   would jc lie about something as serious as the referendum for eu membership ? 
  because the party he leads is engulfed in a civil war at present and many of his supporters are heavily in favour of the eu . 
   the survey is n't perfect , but it 's the best there is and ` treat with caution ' does n't mean ` ignore entirely ' . . of course , but neither does it mean `` gospel truth '' . 
   in regards to why we 'd impose tariffs ? 
  who knows . 
  maybe we 'd do it to hurt the eu for hurting us . 
  maybe we would n't do it at all . 
  i would suggest the latter is far more likely , unless this is some kind of punishment beating that would only be applied to scotland . 
   the point is that it 's just yet another question mark hanging over the head of independence . 
  the details are n't all that important , nor is the truth . 
  truth can only be determined by waiting for a50 to complete and see what trade deals we either have , or start forming . 
  `` but the uncertainty '' was said repeatedly by better together last time round . 
  brexit has turned many of those claims on their head : the process for taking scotland out of the eu is no longer [ to vote for independence ] ( https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584 ) . 
  the fact is that any vote for change brings uncertainty . 
  nobody can predict the future , and waiting for `` certainty '' means waiting until the end of time . 
  however it seems clear ( to me , at least ) that brexit involves far more uncertainty for scotland than leaving the uk does . 
  40 % of eu members are scotland 's size or smaller and it is far easier to picture scotland as a peer to countries like denmark or ireland than it is to even start to figure out the consequences of brexit . 
   look at quebec for a region that just got fed up with an independence movement . 
  and they got much closer than scotland did to independence . 
  now it 's all but dead . 
  i think there are very few parallels to be drawn between quebec and scotland ( or indeed canada and the uk in terms of political structure ) . 
  that one country had two referendums that did n't pass is hardly going to tell you that all countries will follow the same pattern . 
   if scotland does n't wait , it 's potentially sacrificing tariff free exports that make up 65 % of their exports for tariff free exports that make up only 15 % of their exports . . you 're aware , as we 've already had this discussion , that the current estimate of scottish exports to ruk is based on a * voluntary survey * sent out by the scottish government . 
  they receive around 1900 responses all of which are self-selected - there is absolutely no obligation for businesses to reply , let alone to reply accurately . 
  the 64 % figure that they estimate is , as they are quite explicit in pointing out , [ an approximation ] ( http://www.gov.scot/resource/0049/00493251.pdf ) :  rest of uk export estimates should be treated with caution . 
    it is more difficult to ascertain the final destination of sales within the uk as companies have no statutory requirement to collate financial information below uk level . 
    furthermore , particular sectors face challenges in determining what constitutes an ` export ' . 
  in an intra-uk situation , this is particularly the case in the service sector where output is harder to quantify and the residence of the final consumer may be less clear . 
  a voluntary survey is an exceptionally crude way to estimate exports but , in the absence of uk government support , is the best estimate they can make . 
  the idea that the uk will seek to impose trade tariffs on either scotland or ireland is , curiously , never actually explained . 
  by how much ? 
  on which sectors ? 
  for what purpose ? 
  are you suggesting that 64 % of scottish exports would simply stop and fall to zero ? 
  if so presumably those same tariffs would also apply to the rest of the eu , so the uk would find itself losing the 44 % of exports that it makes to the eu ? 
  it seems quite natural that they would fall slightly , as the historical situation means you would expect them to be higher than two neighbouring sovereign states , but beyond that what are you basing your claim on ? 
  will they fall to 10 % ? 
   wait and see is the only option . 
  anything else will guarantee a loss because the ` better together ' campaign will crucify the ` yes ' campaign and snp for asking scotland to choose between two unknowns .
