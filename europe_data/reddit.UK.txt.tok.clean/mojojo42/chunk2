  their [ latest article ] ( http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jennyhjul/100272166/if-scottish-teens-are-backing-the-union-in-whose-name-are-the-nats-fighting/ ) claims the `` snp 's cynical ploy to extend the suffrage to 16 - and 17-year-olds [ was ] based on a mistaken belief that youngsters would vote yes '' , when they were actually campaigning to lower it at least [ ten years ago ] ( http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040309/debtext/40309-28.htm#40309-28_head0 ) ... that said , the political system in the uk is such that the scottish government did essentially need westminster 's permission to hold a referendum . 
  how the referendum should work was set out in the [ edinburgh agreement ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/government/concordats/referendum-on-independence ) , and one of the terms of that is that the franchise would be extended ( provided the scottish parliament approved it , and paid for the registration process ) . 
  but that 's really after the fact - that describes what the deal was , but not why . 
  ten months prior to that agreement salmond was arguing [ for a single question ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/25/salmond-multi-option-scottish-referendum ) :  at the scottish parliament , salmond will confirm that his preference is for full independence , but will say he could stage a two-question or multi-option referendum to include a middle way choice of far greater powers for holyrood while remaining in the uk -- but only if its supporters can make that case . 
  labour , the lib dems , and the conservatives all favoured a single question . 
  publicly the argument was that multiple questions would be confusing , my guess is that privately they figured yes/no was more likely to produce a no result than yes/no/more-powers . 
   is a ` yes ' result a commitment to independence ? 
  strictly speaking , no . 
  the uk parliament is the supreme parliament within the uk and has the power to override the scottish parliament on all matters ( including dissolving the scottish parliament ) . 
  in practical terms though , a yes vote in the referendum is essentially a commitment to independence . 
  it seems extremely unlikely that the uk government would ignore it . 
   could n't the rest of the uk just make it such a shitty prospect during negotiations that the people who originally voted yes would n't want it any more ? 
  anything 's possible - the uk could launch a nuclear strike the day after independence and reduce central scotland to radioactive rubble . 
  that said , the [ edinburgh agreement ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/government/concordats/referendum-on-independence ) which defined the scope of the referendum seems more positive :  30 ) the united kingdom and scottish governments are committed , through the memorandum of understanding 4 between them and others , to working together on matters of mutual interest and to the principles of good communication and mutual respect . 
  the two governments have reached this agreement in that spirit . 
  they look forward to a referendum that is legal and fair producing a decisive and respected outcome . 
  the two governments are committed to continue to work together constructively in the light of the outcome , whatever it is , in the best interests of the people of scotland and of the rest of the united kingdom . 
  personally i do n't think negotiations have to be a case of winner vs loser or biggest-country-wins . 
  if independence is going to happen then both sides benefit from having a prosperous neighbour - both countries are still going to be on the same island . 
   it was decided before they wrote the referendum if i recall . 
  they persuaded salmond to exclude it in the referendum in exchange for allowing 16/17 year olds to vote in it . 
  the snp have campaigned to lower the voting age to 16 long before the referendum ( due to the age of legal capacity being 16 in scotland , vs 18 in the rest of the uk ) . 
  the terms of the referendum had to be set by westminster so it is possible that extending the franchise was included as some kind of trade-off for something else . 
  but given that the snp were n't putting forward multiple questions i do n't think they could really be said to have excluded it in exchange . 
  that said , if you have a source for it i 'd be happy to change my mind !, 
   if a similar vote was held in england , i ca n't imagine what , but let 's say something important and life changing , i 'm not sure that i 'd want such a slim majority to change things so significantly . 
  similar referendums have been held in the uk - eec membership or av voting reform were both national issues which would have had fundamental consequences . 
  the 1979 referendum for scottish devolution is the only one that added a [ 40 % threshold ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_devolution_referendum,_1979#results ) . 
   why not jut do this in the first place . 
  it would almost certainly have [ won the ballot ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26245611 ) . 
  the desire for a single yes/no question was a gamble , on the grounds that given the choice between independence or the status quo people would probably go for the status quo . 
  the result is not going to be a landslide , in either direction , but it looks like it will be close - and a real possibility that the result will be for independence . 
  hence the promise of more powers . 
  the same situation occurred in 1979 , on the first referendum over devolution itself , where the conservative party promised additional powers in return for a no vote then failed to do so after the result . 
   it was an option on the referendum originally . 
  cameron and salmond agreed to take it off in exchange for allowing 16/17 year olds to vote that 's not quite correct . 
  the scottish government stated that they would be in favour of including a devo-max question , if [ devo-max was defined ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/25/salmond-multi-option-scottish-referendum ) ( there were [ a variety of terms ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-17094333 ) being used at the time : devo-max , devo-plus , etc ) . 
  all three main parties at westminster wanted a single yes/no question on the ballot . 
   i would n't mind the idea of devo max , to be honest . 
  i suspect most people would agree - that 's probably why westminster excluded it from the ballot . 
   the age of criminal responsibility in the uk is 10 . 
  as an aside , this is just in england/wales/ni . 
  in scotland it is currently 8 . 
  although by convention , children under 12 are n't prosecuted for criminal behaviour .

  you 'll enjoy it a lot more if you avoid the plot summary on wikipedia . 
  maybe try / r/postcardexchange ? 
  he 's referring to the uk government 's plans to hold [ a referendum ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/10526825/cameron-prepares-nuclear-option-on-eu-referendum.html ) on eu membership . 
  this would take place before 2017 , but after the scottish independence referendum later this year . 
   true , but just recently has it picked up momentum , and it continues to expand very rapidly , so who knows where it will go ? 
  there has been recent growth but imo the most likely stopping point will be cultural . 
  there 's definitely some kind of `` shared values '' that people in europe share . 
  every country has different opinions of course but there 's also a general agreement about the rule of law , elected democracies , free markets , etc. 
  at some point you will reach countries which do n't share those values ( or do n't share them `` enough '' , for some definition of enough ) . 
  you might have a free market , but if you 're an unelected theocracy with the death penalty you 're unlikely to get much traction . 
  accession of that type of country is very unlikely to happen unless they change themselves to be come more `` european '' . 
  that is n't going to be a forced process , it 's one where countries on the periphery see the benefits that the eu has brought and want to participate . 
  for some context , europe has been a continual battlefield for the [ last 2000 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_conflicts_in_europe ) . 
  that has pretty much stopped , primarily because it 's not feasible for members to attack each other without damaging themselves . 
  many of their own citizens now live or work in other eu countries , many of their businesses have suppliers or consumers in other countries , richer countries contribute funds that help raise the standard of living in poorer countries , etc. 
  all of those things happen outside the eu as well of course but perhaps not to the same extent . 
  for example , it 's theoretically possible that the us and mexico might have some kind of cross-border conflict . 
  it was certainly true of france and germany in the past . 
  it 's pretty much impossible that vermont and new hampshire would , and i would say the same about a franco-german conflict today . 
   i know many supporters of eu that want the eu to ` dissolve ' those countries and just be one independent country , and do n't tell me that is n't true . 
  some people do want to have a `` federal eu '' , where today 's countries effectively become the equivalent of states in the us . 
  many people do n't . 
  it does n't seem very likely that such a thing would happen this century . 
  the eu itself is only 70 years old and a shared currency has only been around for 13 years ( and even then , 10 out of the eu 's 28 states do n't use it ) . 
   the change in pace about the currency is what really gets my goat . 
  why join a currency union with the uk if you just left the uk . 
  it does n't sound very independent ... 
  independence is about how you raise money and what you choose to spend it on , not what type of money you use . 
  i 've commented on the uk 's [ three opt-outs here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1sv3bh/independent_scotland_would_have_to_reapply_to_eu/ce1vhim ) . 
  afaik the eu has nothing to say regarding which side of the road is used for driving ; certainly most countries ( including the uk ) allow both left and right-hand drive vehicles on their roads . 
  in terms of the euro , joining the eurozone requires the country meet certain criteria . 
  one of these criteria is two years membership of the erm ii mechanism , membership of which [ is voluntary ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/adoption/erm2/index_en.htm ) :  participation in erm ii is voluntary although , as one of the convergence criteria for entry to the euro area , a country must participate in the mechanism without severe tensions for at least two years before it can qualify to adopt the euro . 
  a commitment to join the euro is a commitment in principle - countries join when both they and the ec agree that the convergence criteria have been met . 
  it is not imposed unilaterally on joining the eu . 
   / u/pillger wrote : `` there is no way that the eu will kick them out and make them go though the process of reapplication . '', 
  by disputing , what i meant was the idea that if scotland left the uk it would not automatically leave the eu . 
  i think that is quite clear , and i do n't think any politicians in the uk/eu/scotland disagree . 
  so the question is really one of timing . 
  does scotland leave the uk and then spend some time outside the uk and eu before re-joining , or does it defer leaving the uk until such time as it can leave the uk and join the eu simultaneously ? 
   well , i 'm pretty sure they will find a solution to make this work in a short time but scotland will have to apply for membership as they are not yet a member . 
  but i think it would be possible to get full membership status in these 18 months . 
  i doubt that scotland will get the same privileges as the uk though ... sure , i think the most likely scenario is that the eu will simply deal with the situation as it unfolds . 
  if scotland votes no then there 's nothing to do . 
  if scotland votes yes then the question is simply should they be allowed to `` apply '' while still part of the uk ? 
  there is no precedent for that situation so i think pragmatism will win over ideology . 
  saying to a country `` yes , we know you 're already compatible with the eu in every sense - but you 're going to have to wait over there for 3 years just because '' seems counter-productive . 
  if that was the final decision then scotland would simply defer leaving the uk a little longer . 
  i 've posted about the uk 's current opt-outs [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1sv3bh/independent_scotland_would_have_to_reapply_to_eu/ce1vhim ) . 
  i think schengen is really the only one of significance , but given that it would make no practical difference to any other member i do n't see it as being a particularly large problem . 
  imo it 's likely to get handled as a `` yes , domestic politics means the british isles are a bit odd '' situation , where ruk/ireland/scotland make a point of feeling a bit separate from the continent . 
   i was n't talking about anyone other than the snp and that argument is ( as you rightly said ) flimsy as hell .
