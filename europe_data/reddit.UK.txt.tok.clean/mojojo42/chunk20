  exactly ; the start of 2017 means brexit takes effect at the start of 2019 , 18 months before the uk general election . 
  any later and the 2020 election risks becoming a vote on how people feel the * negotiations * have been handled . 
  it makes far more sense for the conservatives to aim to have brexit wrapped up a year in advance . 
  if it goes `` well '' they can still take the credit during the election campaign , if it goes badly they can argue that the country needs stability and we ca n't risk a change of government . 
  if you assume it 's quite likely to go badly then it also makes sense to get some distance between that result and an election vs having them fresh in people 's minds . 
  there are also french , german , and italian elections happening from mid-2017 through to mid-2018 and one or more of those administrations may well change . 
  imo may 's plan is to get hollande and merkel to agree to the broad picture of what brexit looks like before those elections . 
  brexit is going to be painful for everyone , so , if she can get a rough agreement on the basic model ( eea + , eea , eea - , out ) then she knows any subsequent f/g administrations are going to be reluctant to mess with that too much . 
  as such may 's best window is early 2017 . 
  that gives her six months to have some informal discussions and to come up with a rough plan herself . 
  it 's still asking for the impossible ( economically we need free movement/london 's financial status , politically she must stop free movement/bankers are n't popular ) but she ca n't act immediately and she ca n't push it back forever . 
   scotland faces serious economic consequences if it leaves the uk , especially if it did n't have freedom of movement with ruk which seems probable . 
  scotland faces serious economic consequences if it leaves * with * the uk , especially if it did n't have freedom of movement with the eu which seems probable . 
  retaining eu membership was a [ central argument of better together ] ( https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584 ) during the independence referendum . 
  the snp 's argument for calling another referendum will be based on the fact that a majority of msps in the scottish parliament support it ( even assuming that [ scottish labour do n't push for it too ] ( https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/uk-regions/scotland/news/76576/scottish-labour-consider-all-options-amid-second-independence ) , which is by no means a certainty now ) , scotland voted to remain in the eu , and brexit takes scotland out of the eu . 
  in the immediate future there 's no need to call another referendum before a50 is invoked but , if you take may at her previous word that `` brexit means brexit '' then it 's only a matter of time . 
  of course if you take may at today 's word that we need `` a uk-wide approach '' then scotland will remain in the eu , and so the immediate need for a referendum abates . 
  the snp will be absolutely fine with that - they are far more interested in protecting scotland 's interests than pursuing independence for its own sake . 
   but this polling was just on general independence , not about remaining in the uk if scotland leaves ? 
  iirc it was on if the islands should remain in the uk if scotland leaves . 
   did n't leaders of shetland and orkney say that they wanted a vote if scotland left last time ? 
  not that i 'm aware of , no . 
   i remember it caused quite a stir with one of my work colleagues when salmond pretty much brushed them off . 
  salmond was pushing pretty hard for the [ lerwick declaration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lerwick_declaration ) at the time , so that would be an odd position for him to take given that was in direct response to the island 's own `` our islands -- our future '' programme the previous year . 
  those working groups have led to the [ islands bill consulation ] ( http://www.gov.scot/publications/2016/03/1090/3 ) , which in turn has led to things like putting the na-h-eileanan an lar consituency on the same statutory footing as orkney and shetland . 
   if there 's no stomach for it , let them vote to prove that . 
  the population of the three largest are under 60k so it would n't take a lot of effort for someone to organise a significant percentage of the population . 
  [ assuming they actually wanted to , of course ] ( http://www.newsnet.scot/nns-archive/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7203:northern-isles-are-scottish-say-islanders ) :  acording to a report published in the times newspaper in 2009 , during the campaign for scottish home rule in the 1970s , uk treasury officials suggested encouraging local campaigns for independence in orkney and shetland in order to deprive scotland of as much of the oil reserves as possible . 
    in his diaries , the late anthony crosland , who was a cabinet minister in the labour government until his death in 1977 , admitted that the uk government intended to plant stories with sympathetic journalists and politicians to foster divisions between the northern isles and scotland as part of a campaign to subvert scottish self-determination . 
   if i take something against your will , but give you something in return , is that theft ? 
  unless you 're some kind of '' [ freeman on the land ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freemen_on_the_land ) '' then , no , that 's society . 
   scotland leaves the uk because it was dragged out of the eu against it 's will . 
  seems logical that orkney and shetland should get a referendum to leave scotland if they 're dragged out of the uk against theirs . 
  i believe the only polling that 's been done on it , back in 2014 during the independence referendum , showed 82 % of islanders wanting to remain part of scotland . 
   ofc , i see why there may be worries about losing `` scotland 's oil '' if they left . 
  this is pretty much the only reason that papers like the telegraph keep running this . 
  that there 's absolutely no popular support for the idea is irrelevant when your motivation is just to run `` ok , fine , maybe you will leave the uk - but if you did then shetland would leave you ... and take the oil !!! '', 
  stories . 
   with respect , that 's exactly what she proposed . 
  the relationship between the scottish and uk parliaments is that , even on areas that are theoretically devolved to the scottish government , the uk government can always have the final say . 
  there is [ a convention ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4229855.stm ) that once westminster has said something is devolved to holyrood then it will no longer legislate on that matter , but it is just that - a convention . 
  to keep everyone agreeable the scottish parliament normally agrees to let westminster overrule them by passing a legislative consent motion . 
  that agreement is a formality of course , as westminster has the final say , so sturgeon 's point was simply that : * if the scottish parliament is asked to pass a lcm to allow brexit then it will probably decline to do so . 
  * failure to pass that lcm will have no bearing on brexit as westminster will simply overrule it . 
  * but this would then be the first time that westminster explicitly overruled the scottish government . 
  from a brexit point of view , that makes no difference . 
  brexit will still happen . 
  from an internal uk political point of view , that would be extremely contentious . 
  it would be further evidence of scotland and the uk going in separate directions . 
  the weekend after the referendum , which is when that link is from , the media were desperately scrambling around to find some rationale by which brexit could somehow be avoided . 
  they latched onto sturgeon 's play to force westminster 's hand , and tried to turn that into a `` scotland could block brexit '' story . 
  that 's not the case , nor have the [ snp ever said they could ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/alex-salmond-scottish-parliament-cannot-block-brexit/ ) . 
   just a point about french and german elections , the reason it is better to trigger afterwards is that otherwise you 're essentially negotiating with a lame duck administration , especially in the case of france . 
  so after late 2017 their position could change a lot . 
  in that way it makes sense to wait . 
  the problem with that timetable is that deferring the * start * until after the french/german elections pushes the * end * ( if you assume it will take the full two years ) exactly on top of the next uk election . 
  that 's in may 2020 , so triggering it at any point after jan 2018 means the final negotiations are going overlap with the 2020 campaign and/or vote . 
  i suspect may mentioned `` not before the end of 2016 '' for exactly this reason . 
  she wants six months to try and figure some kind of plan out , and she 's thinking of the start of 2017 for article 50 and initial negotiations . 
  that puts activation before either french/german elections but gives you a couple of months to sketch out the big `` how do we even do this ? '', 
  questions with the rest of the eu , with final details getting worked out once the french/german elections are out of the way and everyone 's positions have solidified . 
  that in turn puts the exit date at the start of 2019 , which gives you a year to plan out your 2020 campaign vs trying to campaign and negotiate in parallel . 
   it 's entirely unfathomable for them that other commonwealth countries today have absolutely vital economic ties to other countries , many of them in their close geographic vicinity and with ties which will now always be stronger than anything britain could offer . 
  sadly true . 
  i do n't know if it 's a post-empire hangup , but british exceptionalism is driving a great deal of the leave thinking . 
   it does n't matter . 
  it absolutely does matter . 
  [ voting no to retain eu membership ] ( https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584 ) was a central claim of the better together campaign . 
   the next government will have no choice but to invoke article 50 this is not strictly correct . 
  uk referendums are advisory , not binding , and it would be perfectly legal for the government to ignore the result . 
  it would be extremely difficult politically , because whoever did it will be crucified as acting undemocratically at the next elections ( due in 2020 ) , but depending on how bad things get it 's definitely an option . 
  that said , any choice is going to be difficult : * if you ignore the result then the half of the country that voted out will hate you . 
  * if you honour the result , and actually withdraw completely , the other half of the country will hate you . 
  * if you try and compromise with eea then everyone hates you . 
  the half that wanted out do n't see eea as really leaving , the half that wanted stay give you grudging credit for not crashing the economy but are still angry that you 've downgraded our eu membership for nothing . 
   plus , if there was a plan , it is about fucking time to start doing something there 's no plan . 
  [ two weeks ago ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36534192 ) the chancellor said there would have to be an emergency budget if the uk voted to leave , today he 's announced that as it 's such an emergency it 'll have to [ wait until october ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/george-osbornes-emergency-brexit-budget-is-not-going-to-happen-yet_uk_5770c74de4b0d2571149dd8c ) . 
   it is n't to do with the size of the country , but economic performance . 
  in eu you have successful countries like germany and netherlands , and countries with problems like spain and greece . 
  you do . 
  you also have countries like denmark , ireland , or finland which - while not being as successful as germany - have nothing like the problems of greece . 
   if scotland stumbles out the eu with a low oil price and a grim medium term economic future then they can expect to be in bailout territory , which means surrendering total control to the eu . 
  i disagree . 
   your link is broken . 
  sorry , fixed now . 
   i do recommend people read it , the overall tone is serious chance of financial disaster . 
  the ` what if ' paragraph is n't very reassuring . 
  the ifs are not themselves above criticism . 
  they generally lean towards the right/free market and were a regular rent-a-quote [ during the independence campaign ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/12200495/ifs-scotland-to-get-billions-of-english-income-tax.html ) ( `` ifs : scotland to get billions of english income tax '' ) . 
  elsewhere in this thread you will find an [ excellent comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pxmsp/scottish_independence_has_nearly_60_per_cent/d4p1lcg ) pointing out the difficulty of trying to predict the future of scotland 's economy given that its current situation is largely a result of uk government policy . 
  i think it 's worth considering that 40 % of existing eu members are scotland 's size or smaller . 
  it seems unlikely that , as a well educated nation of 5 million people , scotland is the only country in the world which will meet financial disaster if it has the temerity to step outside the uk . 
   but we can lower income tax if we wish . 
  the above poster was spouting lies - again . 
  he was incorrect , however your response was missing some key information . 
   we 're also gaining the power to vary them individually . 
  they 've been legislated for 2017 so wo n't gain that power for another year . 
  which is fine , however that 's some three years after the referendum itself . 
   does anyone know of the credibility of this journalist ? 
  if what he says is true then ... wow !,
