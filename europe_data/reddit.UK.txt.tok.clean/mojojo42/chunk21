  currently at sky news , previously at channel four news , neither of which are perfect but both have reasonable reputations for asking awkward questions . 
  he did most of channel four 's coverage of the financial crisis so he 's a very familiar face on british tv - i 've no doubt that this went down exactly as he said . 
   proportionally scotland 's is twice the rate of uk , but by 2020 uk is set to run a surplus while scotland 's will still be increasing , according to the ifs . 
  [ also according to the ifs ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/24/ifs-scotland-debts-three-times-greater-uk ) :  the ifs did cautiously qualify its deficit forecasts , acknowledging that independence might improve scotland 's finances . 
    it could cut its debt costs by negotiating a favourable deal with the uk and could see its economy grow faster than within the uk , with greater freedom to tax and spend differently . 
   yeah , i do n't see how customs and passport controls on the anglo-scottish border would n't be very damaging . 
  the scottish/english border is going to end up exactly the same as the ireland/northern ireland border - that 's not a situation that will be unique to scotland . 
   yes but will you actually get the referendum ? 
  what if the uk government just tells you `` no '' ? 
  support for independence will grow further . 
  but [ westminster knows this too ] ( https://twitter.com/kevinjpringle/status/746989043305549824 ) . 
   as long as westminster consents to a second referendum . 
  quite the opposite if they do not and sturgeon runs it unilaterally . 
  sturgeon is well aware of this . 
  scotland is not going to declare independence unilaterally , but neither is the uk going to try and retain scotland no matter what . 
   what ? 
  yes we are . 
  we are allowed to vary all three bands at once - if you want to raise the top rate of tax you also need to raise the lowest by the same amount . 
   we even already had that power the power devolved in 1999 worked exactly the same way , except with a smaller amount ( 3 % rather than 10 % ) and the scottish government would have had to pay an additional surcharge to the treasury for collecting the tax . 
  no administration - snp , labour , or labour/lib-dem - has made any use of these powers for the very simple reason that they were designed to be unusable . 
  oh , no argument there . 
  edit : for those outside the uk it 's worth pointing out that we only use fptp for westminster elections . 
  for scottish parliamentary elections we use ams . 
   his opinion is one of excitement as he can now buy pounds for when they inevitably bounce back because britain is `` strong '' house prices only ever go up . 
   if they force a new leadership vote , corbyn restands and wins with a large mandate again it will be the end of a lot of blairite careers . 
  the conservatives have always been torn in two over the eu - do we hate it , or do we really hate it ? 
  most of labour , membership or mps , have always been very pro-eu . 
  corbyn has been conspicuously low-profile during this campaign and [ that may have been deliberate ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jeremy-corbyn-allies-sabotaged-labour-in-campaign-and-fuelled-brexit_uk_576eb1b5e4b0d2571149bb1f?f0kkhs8f68cucjtt9 ) . 
   they got a million more votes than the snp in 2015 . 
  they did , but given that the snp only stand in scotland that 's not exactly a ringing endorsment . 
  the lib dems received 7.5 % of the vote within scotland , vs 50.0 % for the snp . 
  they 're still a large `` small party '' within westminster . 
  but in scotland they 're now in fifth place behind the scottish greens ( which is simply astonishing in uk politics , where the greens have always been seen as a truly extreme fringe ) . 
   i thought that in britain you do n't vote for the prime minister , you vote for mps , then the queen name a prime minister who is usually the leader of winning party . 
  in the uk we vote for mps , the monarch appointments a party ( typically the largest ) as their government , and the leader of that party becomes the prime minister . 
  the monarch 's role is essentially to confirm the will of parliament ; they do n't get to actually choose anything . 
   if the rest of the eu would like us to start to official negotiations swiftly then they need to make it clear why it is in our interest to do so . 
  the uk and the eu are going to continue to have * some * form of relationship post-brexit . 
  prolonging the uncertainty causes more difficulties for the rest of the eu - dragging things out deliberately is unlikely to benefit the uk in future negotiations . 
   isnt scottish nationalism ethnic nationalism ? 
  `` scottish nationalism '' , by any reasonable metric , is entirely civic . 
  `` scottishness '' is the shared culture created by the people who live here , wherever they 're from . 
  you can certainly find racists and other nutters in scotland , just as you can in any country , but they have absolutely no widespread support . 
   this whole `` we 're going to do whatever we want without consequence and everyone is just going to go along with it ! '', 
  is so preposterously ridiculous welcome to british nationalism ... 
   yeah , it was in her manifesto - but she lost her majority as a result as people voted tory to stop her . 
  the scottish parliament uses [ ams ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/additional_member_system ) . 
  obtaining a majority under that voting system is extremely unusual , compared to the fptp system we use for the uk parliament . 
  `` losing their majority '' took them from 53.4 % of the seats in parliament to 48.9 % ( and , given the success of the scottish greens , a majority of msps are still pro-independence ) . 
  within the uk `` unionist '' always means pro the current structure of the uk . 
  pro-eu is normally `` europhile '' . 
   so it would n't go through . 
  if everyone voted as they did before , correct . 
  however nanakorobi 's claim that `` support has fallen drastically '' is incorrect - two years later , support is unchanged . 
  i think it 's worth remembering that many people who voted no did so not out of an intrinsic belief in the uk but because they believed remaining in the uk * was in scotland 's best interests * . 
  this is something that is often overlooked when discussing scotland , both the uk media and in places like / r/ukpolitics . 
  the idea that voting yes would lead to scotland being expelled from the eu was a [ central theme of the no campaign ] ( https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584 ) . 
  if you believe that scotland benefits from being within the eu and voted no accordingly then you may have a different view if - and it is still an if - the uk decides to leave . 
  it 's only within the last week or so that it has become apparent that the uk may actually do it . 
  it 's been 50:50 for some time but there does now seem to be a real trend towards leave - the latest polling showed remain 47/leave 53 . 
  that same poll showed remain 64/leave 36 within scotland so , given that the difference between yes/no in the independence referendum was only 200k people , i think the situation is extremely fluid . 
  if the uk votes to remain then i 'd expect scotland to be independent within about 20-30 years . 
  if they vote to leave then i would expect it within 5 . 
   this has turned into a whataboutism now ... that 's not what `` whataboutism '' means . 
  you made a claim , i showed you it was incorrect . 
   just be careful with how you link to other subs because sometimes they prefer you to use https://www.reddit.com/r/noparticipation/wiki/intro . 
  / r/scotland pumped yer da . 
   really ? 
  i saw quite a few comments over there . 
  [ this is the only comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/scotland/comments/4oidpv/nicola_sturgeon_would_negotiate_direct_with/d4da9dt ) referencing this thread , which has one reply saying :  that place is flooded with kippers . 
    you barely see any moderate comments from the uk on / r/europe these days , i think most people just gave up on the place since it became so hostile . 
  he has a point . 
  a quick look shows shitfacephil defending ukip 's '' [ nazi propaganda ] ( http://indy100.independent.co.uk/article/people-are-calling-out-ukips-new-antieu-poster-for-resembling-outright-nazi-propaganda--wktyub18ew ) '' poster , and nanakorobi_yaoki calling sturgeon a `` traitor '' and complaining about immigration . 
  i mostly read / r/europe , rather than post , but posters from the uk have definitely trended towards the right over the last few years . 
  as indeed has / r/ukpolitics , whose version of this thread is calling for the army to be deployed to scotland and snp politicians arrested for treason because that is perfectly reasonable and in no way batshit insane . 
   quite funny seeing people in / r/scotland get angry over this thread . 
  i do n't see anyone getting angry over it . 
  it 's interesting how many of the rabidly pro-unionist posters who like to troll / r/scotland have also turned up in this thread though . 
   well in that case it would not go through then right ? 
  support for either independence or the union is unchanged since the actual referendum itself . 
   with oil worth $ 50 a barrel good luck funding that . 
  oil formed about 10 % of scotland 's gdp , the same as food & drink exports . 
  40 % of eu members are scotland 's size or smaller and virtually none of those countries - bar denmark - have any oil whatsoever . 
   there was literally one poll that showed a 1 % lead for leaving in that referendum . 
  nothing like this . 
  [ two polls had yes ahead ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#2014 ) immediately prior to the referendum . 
  yougov polled 47:45 for the 2nd-5th september , icm polled 49:42 on 10th-11th september . 
  [ guardian coverage ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/shameful-leaveeu-tweet-uk-face-orlando-style-attack ) . 
   where do people keep getting this idea that scotland really wants to be in the eu , 40 % voted out . 
  and 62 % voted to remain . 
   the few scots i know want full independence , from the uk/eu . 
  then the few scots you know are n't really representative of the wider public . 
   even though the scottish government has wide-sweeping powers over the economy not really , no . 
  edit : ah , i see the britnats have arrived . 
   they did n't win a majority though , so claiming that the contents of the manifesto are the will of the majority of the scottish electorate is simply not accurate the scottish parliament uses a proportional voting system and so winning a majority is extremely rare . 
  by way of comparison to uk elections , which use fptp , the snp 's minority government received 44 % of the vote compared with the conservative 's uk majority that received 37 % . 
  that aside , both the snp and the scottish greens are in favour of this referendum so a majority of representatives in the the scottish parliament support this move . 
   but i feel the government has enough problems to deal with right now the uk government is scotland 's government too . 
   just to clarify , scotland does not want independence . 
  it never will , no matter what polls you clutch onto .
