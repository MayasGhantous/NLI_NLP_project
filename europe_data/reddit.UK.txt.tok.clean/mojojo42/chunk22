  until the day it does . 
   this is just another fantasy . 
  please , move on and post actual useful information . 
  like how scotland is basically the worst country in the eu for health , the sick man of europe . 
  of course it can not survive . 
  if that 's the position that being in the uk has left scotland in then you 're not really selling me on the benefits here ... scotland does have serious problems . 
  we spend # 3bn a year dealing with alcohol in scotland , the same as england and wales combined ( despite having 1/10th of the population ) . 
  if being in the uk can address that then i 'd be all for it . 
  however it manifestly has not , and i do n't see anything to suggest that it will . 
   neither quebec , nor scotland will become independent in the near future . 
  i do n't know much about quebec , however scotland is a certainty . 
   obviously it 's not mental , racist nationalism , but scottish nationalism , at the end of the day , comes down to seeing all people living north of the border with england as fundamentally different from all people living south of it . 
  no , it does n't . 
  it comes down to saying that the people best placed to make decisions about scotland are those who live in scotland . 
  people in england are no more different to the people in scotland than they are different to the people in ireland . 
  desiring political autonomy has nothing to do with seeing yourself as fundamentally different , or better or worse , than anyone else . 
   i was going off the 2015 election results . 
  the [ 2015 election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_general_election,_2015_ ( scotland ) ) was for the uk parliament , so uses first past the post . 
  the conservatives got 15 % of the vote but only 1 % of the seats . 
  a better comparison is the [ 2016 election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_parliament_election,_2016 ) for the scottish parliament , which uses the proportional ams ( aka mmp ) . 
  there the conservatives got 22 % of the vote and 24 % of the seats . 
  their core support in scotland has been around 15 % for the last 40 years or so , it 's just that fptp has distorted the results . 
  their support has picked up by a bit recently but primarily that 's down to scottish labour imploding and the scottish conservatives explicitly targeting the hard-core unionist vote . 
   why was it ok that the single biggest choice the people of scotland have ever made was open to pollution from people that could n't give a shit which way it went ? 
  is your objection to people who did n't give a shit getting to vote , or that people who were allowed to vote were also allowed to leave scotland ? 
  because the former includes a lot of people born in scotland too and the latter is absolutely everyone . 
  until such time as there is scottish citizenship , residency is absolutely the right way to determine who should be allowed to vote . 
  he 's referring to [ the mccrone report ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mccrone_report ) . 
  he 's referring to [ the mccrone report ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mccrone_report ) . 
   a claim that was made by gordon brown the claim was made by better together , the official campaign group for no . 
  [ gordon brown 's claim ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/gordon-brown-backs-federalism-in-event-of-no-vote-1-3511291 ) was that voting no would mean `` we 're going to be , within a year or two [ from 2014 ] , as close to a federal state as you can be '' . 
   it has a deficit , google it if you do n't believe me . 
  scotland received borrowing powers for the first time in 2016 - the maximum deficit it was allowed to borrow was # 340m . 
   they had the right to , they had their once in a generation referendum and they had their say now it 's time to move on . 
  a key claim in that referendum was that [ voting no means staying in the eu ] ( https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584?lang=en-gb ) . 
   if the eu plays hard ball ( as many here want ) and the trade deal between the uk and eu is shitty , then scotland will have 65 % of its exports and services come under that shitty trade deal if they were to join the eu . 
  and the uk has 44 % of its imports coming from the eu and 53 % of its exports going to the eu . 
  a bad trade deal between the uk and the eu will impact scotland either way . 
   in fact , even if the trade deal is absolutely brilliant it 'll still never be as good as the current 100 % friction free trade scotland currently enjoys with the rest of the uk . 
  `` if you stay with me i 'll give you 100 % friction free access to the marital home ... that i 've just burnt to the ground '' . 
   but i have to remember that the majority do n't vote for the snp , and they do n't deserve it . 
  you should probably also remember that the snp abstained from that vote , and the scottish mps that did vote were all replaced by snp mps in 2015 . 
   i recall the last time you made that talking point , only then you actually linked to a video of the whole debate rather than an edited video of a lesser quality that deliberately removes the argument that davidson was responding to do you have a link ? 
  that clip is the only one i ever recall being able to find on youtube . 
   in which patrick harvie claims that there would be an eu referendum and that voting yes was the only way to secure eu membership whereas voting no would take scotland out of the eu . 
  surprise !, 
  scotland is being taken out of the eu . 
   sure but the torries usually underperform in the pools , i think it 's known as the shy torrie effect or something sommilat . 
  [ it is indeed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shy_tory_factor ) , however at that point the uk was still experiencing its first coalition government [ for 65 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_coalition_government ) . 
  most people were expecting either a second conservative/liberal coalition administration or a labour/liberal one . 
  that the conservatives did actually get a majority was a complete surprise to everyone , including the conservatives themselves . 
   i do n't get this scottish circlejerk , they votet to stay in britain knowing that a referendum was coming up . 
  two of the three main parties had explicitly ruled out an eu referendum , the third had offered to hold one if they won a majority government ( which nobody , including themselves , expected to happen ) . 
   was a minor talking point . 
  no , it was a core part of the debate . 
   the idea the eu was some huge issue is revisionism by scottish nationalists desperate for their second chance . 
  here 's ruth davidson , leader of the scottish conservatives , talking during one of the televised debates that you would n't have seen because it was n't aired outside of scotland , that [ voting no meant staying in the eu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lygrkk7mp3e ) and it was looking unlikely that there would even be an eu referendum . 
  that you live 400 miles south of scotland may explain your lack of understanding of what people were actually discussing . 
   scotland does not have the right to negotiate with foreign countries on behalf of scots , all that was and still is done by the uk government . 
  the nature of scotland 's future relationship to the eu was central to the debate in the 2014 referendum . 
  the uk government were , as you say , the only entity with the official ability to ask the ec for an opinion . 
  [ they refused to ask ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/18/scottish-independence-mic_n_2324048.html ) . 
   it defends our interests . 
  how ? 
   anyway , you do n't need to think about it too much in detail . 
  it just looks good to tory/ukip voters . 
  sending british troops to sit on their arse in poland doing absolutely nothing does n't * sound * like a vote winner . 
   an extra base in a foreign country would be a political win for a party that claims to be strong on defense . 
  how does spending money on a permanent base in poland defend the uk ? 
   that may have been part of the debate but it was n't the question , same with the eu ref lots of things were discussed but it came down to a single question . 
  the argument that was made repeatedly was that voting no was a vote for stability ; why risk the uncertainty of independency vs the safety and stability offered by the uk . 
  brexit has turned that argument on its head - the uk is itself facing an uncertain future . 
   i 'm also not convinced most of the people who voted no in the indyref did so because they were worried about having to leave the eu . 
  i think something that 's often missed when talking about 2014 is that many of the people who voted no did so because they thought that was * best for scotland * , not out of an intrinsic love of the uk . 
  people have crossed from no to yes ( and vice versa ) for a variety of reasons , of course , so we wo n't really know who swapped or why until the next referendum . 
  but , for example , 60 % of the eu nationals in scotland voted no last time though . 
  i suspect that group is going to be much more likely to vote yes next time . 
   england is n't a political unit with any power in the uk . 
  england is the de facto political power within the uk . 
   last year , the conservative party proposed reducing restrictions of ` sunday trading ' in england their proposal affected [ both england and scotland ] ( https://constitution-unit.com/2016/03/10/sunday-trading-and-the-limits-of-evel/ ) . 
   an independent scotland will never have commanding power over itself as it will never be the dominant power in the british isles , and always rely on the ruk on issues like defence . 
  we 'll be fine , thanks . 
   no they did n't they voted to remain a part of the uk , the question on the ballot paper was regarding uk membership and had no mention of the eu . 
  one of the [ key arguments during the campaign ] ( https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584?lang=en-gb ) was eu membership . 
   also , it currently receives some # 8.5 bn ( $ 10bn ) a year in barnett payments from the rest of the uk in addition to the tax revenues it generates itself . 
  scotland 's barnett payments are not `` in addition to the tax revenues '' , they are predominantly made * of * those tax revenues . 
  the scottish government only recently , post referendum , gained the ability to retain a small portion of scottish tax revenue . 
  all other revenue generated in scotland is sent to the uk government . 
   to be clear , scotlands budget deficit is currently around 9.5 % of gdp . 
  as an independent country they would have massive economic issues . 
  to be clear , that 's scotland 's share of the uk deficit . 
  the scottish government has only been able to run a deficit since 2015 - to a maximum of # 306m . 
  the uk 's deficit is largely the size it is due to the financial crisis . 
  in 2005 it was # 20bn , in 2009 it was # 50bn , and in 2010 it was over # 100bn . 
   highly misleading headline . 
  severin carrell , the journalist who wrote the story , has been churning out `` scottish independence will trigger the apocalypse '' stories for years . 
   they prevented a thing which would have become english law from becoming english law , when that thing would not have affected scotland . 
  they prevented ( in the sense that they contributed to the defeat of the government in ) a thing that would have affected both england and scotland . 
  legislation that contains a clause that affects england and a clause that affects england + scotland affects both countries . 
  take away the first clause , that affects only england , and it * still * affects both countries .
