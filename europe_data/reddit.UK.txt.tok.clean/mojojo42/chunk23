   play word games all day , but that 's interference and it 's a broken promise . 
  when you start trying to use semantics to explain why your party are n't hypocrites , it 's a good sign that they are . 
  they 're not `` my party '' , nor is this semantics . 
  the legislation would have affected scotland regardless of the amendment . 
  that it was cancelled after an amendment passed that * would not have stopped the effects on scotland * is not semantics , it 's simply a statement of fact . 
   they voted on an amendment that only affected england . 
  they voted on an amendment that * removed * the effects on england . 
  the bill already affected scotland , and would have continued to do so regardless of this amendment . 
   if we put in a uk bill and tacked on an ammendment which introduced tuition fees for scotland , voting for that would be interference in scottish devolved law because your amendment would * add * something to the bill . 
   which meant that they voted on an amendment to the enter which was only affecting the english part of the legislation that 's not really correct . 
  the government were defeated due to the introduction of an amendment by one of their own mps , david burrowes . 
  that amendment would , as you said , have [ deleted the clause relating to england ] ( http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/researchbriefing/summary/sn05522 ) . 
  the bill started off as `` this affects england + this affects everyone '' , it was amended to `` this affects everyone '' , at which point the government decided to cancel it . 
  that the snp supported an amendment to * remove * the english-only part does n't mean they are voting * on * english legislation . 
  the bill would have affected both england and scotland regardless . 
   because the snp was going to vote on it ... 
  so when you said `` have been voting '' , you actually meant `` have not been voting '' ? 
   the snp have historically claimed to abstain on legislation that does n't affect scotland and found excuses to vote on pretty much anything they feel like anyway . 
  for example ? 
   the sunday trading bill did not affect scotland . 
  you should probably tell that to the speaker then , since [ his provisional classification was that it did ] ( https://constitution-unit.com/2016/03/10/sunday-trading-and-the-limits-of-evel/ ) . 
  the legislation contained two separate proposals - one that regarding sunday trading ( that only applies to england and wales ) one that changes workers ' right to opt out of sunday working ( that applies to england , wales , and scotland ) . 
   people - stop downvoting this guy just because you do n't like what he has written . 
  can i downvote him for being deliberately misleading by failing to point out that our msps , who are elected on a proportional basis , voted against brexit yesterday by 73/27 which is n't a million miles away from the referendum result and - six months on - may well reflect public opinion of the oncoming catastrofuck ? 
   the snp have been voting on strictly english only laws , for example the vote to bring back fox hunting in england . 
  you are aware [ that vote was cancelled ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/fox-hunting-protest-live-brian-6062539 ) ? 
   the snp has voted on england only matters despite promises not to firstly , so what ? 
  every mp is entitled to vote on any legislation . 
  that the snp have historically abstained from legislation that did n't affect scotland , while scottish mps from other parties did n't , is a nice gesture by the snp but in no way required behaviour from them . 
  secondly , which legislation ? 
  they threatened to do over fox hunting however the government then withdrew that legislation and so no vote took place . 
  they did vote on a bill that affected sunday trading in both england and scotland because , well , it affected scotland . 
   yugoslav republics ( namely croatia and slovenia ) did n't `` separate '' - the process yugoslavia underwent in 90ies is classified as `` dissolution '' by badinter arbitration committee and that was ( still is ) very important in defining legal relations as well as successions . 
  very different to separation !, 
  the [ arbitration committee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arbitration_commission_of_the_peace_conference_on_yugoslavia#cite_note-pellet-1 ) 's references to `` dissolution '' are probably only sensible to interpret in the context of the sfry 's constitution though . 
  yugoslavia was a federation of several republics and the question of if sfry continued to exist ( and if so which republics it encompassed ) had huge significance given the ongoing conflict . 
  there are some parallels with the uk ( the act of union unified two states into one kingdom but did n't signify the end of either country ) but imo there 's negligible chance of contention over which of scotland/ruk was the uk 's successor state . 
  `` separate '' would certainly be more apt in that context ( the uk will continue to exist , scotland moves outside ) but i take your point that it 's a bit loose when referring to sfry . 
  from a political pov of view though , scotland leaving the uk sets no precedent for catalonia . 
  there 's no real similarity to the situation in spain , where there 's a constitutional disagreement over the legality of even holding a referendum ( vs the uk government explicitly stating they will honour a positive result ) . 
  the two most common claims made during the 2014 referendum were : * `` when scotland joins the eu it 'll be forced to use the euro '' . 
  * `` scotland can never join the eu because spain will veto '' . 
  neither have any basis in fact but , three years later , you still see the same claims being made . 
   why would n't scotland want to do that ? 
  why invent a new currency when one exists ? 
  i would be even more of a pain in the arse , rather than saying `` 12 months from now we 'll be using the euro , get ready '' like all the other nations did . 
  it was relatively painless . 
  there are really two issues : what would the process be like , and what do people believe the process would be like . 
  by far the biggest obstacle the yes campaign in 2014 faced was the idea that voting for independence was a vote for a risky unknown vs the known stability of the uk . 
  this was the very core of the argument against independence and was repeated endlessly by media and politicians . 
  brexit has severely ( probably fatally imo ) undercut that argument . 
  the uk is now facing a very uncertain future , and those in control of the uk 's direction are politically unpopular in scotland . 
  however that sentiment still exists , and so pursuing the simplest possible transition to independence is the snp 's strategy . 
  if something does need to be changed due to independence then it will be ( possession of nuclear weapons ) . 
  if something does n't need to be changed then it wo n't be ( currency ) . 
  i think the point about the brexit vote is a good one , but if i do recall , the plan on having the vote was well underway by the time the referendum was held . 
  you recall incorrectly . 
  of the three main uk political parties two had explicitly ruled out holding a brexit referendum and the conservatives had said they would only hold one if they obtained a majority - which nobody expected them to have . 
  within scotland , the scottish conservatives were quite explicit that voting no meant remaining in the eu and that holding an eu referendum was '' [ not looking likely ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lygrkk7mp3e&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6 ) '' . 
   those who voted ` no ' should have considered the possibility of brexit winning . 
  they were [ explicitly told the opposite ] ( https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584?lang=en-gb ) by the official no campaign . 
   not sure they will make a difference . 
  it would be allowing separatism to happen , which they do n't want . 
  why did spain support slovenia and croatia 's eu membership after they separated ? 
  spain objections to unilateral secession , as per kosovo , not to the existence of new countries . 
   smack-a-rooney currency ? 
  [ reddit delivers ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/odd/alex-salmond-features-on-a-new-two-smackeroonie-coin-1-4222581 ) . 
   you need foreign currency reserves to maintain a tie , something a newly independent scotland would not have . 
  are you saying that scotland would not inherit a share of the uk 's foreign currency reserves ? 
   why not take the euro ? 
  `` you 'll be forced to use the euro '' was a frequent claim during the 2014 referendum ; within the uk the idea that domestic currency will be confiscated and the euro imposed is a frequent trope . 
  a scottish pound that 's pegged to sterling , as ireland did for decades , is the most likely approach in the short term as simplifying ease of interaction with ruk is a key strategy . 
  eventually a scottish pound could be pegged to the euro , as denmark do with the krone , but that 's a choice for some future electorate to make . 
   the british economy will take a hit , but it 's the price we , as a nation , have decided we are willing to pay . 
  i do n't recall that being on the ballot paper . 
   what does this mean the total split cross the population was 52 % to 48 % . 
  if you break the vote down geographically then [ the results look like this ] ( https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/06/uk-eu-referendum-map.jpg ) . 
  if you 're an mp planning to stand for re-election in 2020 then that kind of image is what you 're thinking of . 
  if you vote against a50 then your leave-voting constituents will vote against you in the the next election . \\ our national elections use `` first past the post '' , which is essentially winner-takes-all . 
  the person with the most votes in a constituency gets elected - if you come second you do n't . 
  most of the people in the uk with that view only have a vague sense that ireland is no longer part of the uk . 
   mps surely would n't of been basing their decision to vote for/against trident on what seems a fairly routine test after some systems were upgraded on the submarine . 
  the prime minister surely should be capable of explaining that . 
  [ it was n't a great interview ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/5pg9yg/did_anyone_else_just_see_may_doing_pretty_badly/ ) . 
   some like to stick it to the man and say they are , say scottish before british , while the english are british before english . 
  i think you vastly over-estimate the extent to which people view british as their identity . 
  the most recent census ( 2011 ) found 62 % of scots described themselves as `` scottish only '' , 18 % `` scottish and british '' , and 8 % as `` british only '' . 
  the figures are pretty comparable in england - 58 % `` english only '' , 29 % `` british & something '' , 11 % `` british only '' . 
  the idea that there is a single common identity in the uk is something of a myth . 
   so when he started wearing a white cloth they considered him a faker a '' [ fakir ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fakir ) '' is someone who renounces worldly possessions . 
   it seems quite obvious though ? 
  the anti-independence campaign during the scottish independence referendum ran [ some adverts on this basis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuw6u0jnofs ) , saying that scottish citizens would be unable to access uk embassies while other eu nationals could . 
  the context being the parallel claim that voting for independence was [ voting to remove scotland 's eu citizenship ] ( https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584 ) . 
   it just does n't make sense to me , are they going to use that as a bargaining chip against themselves ? 
  welcome to brexit . 
   that 's not true , the av referendum would have been legally binding . 
  that 's not true . 
  the situation with the av referendum was that legislation was passed * before * the referendum which read `` if a referendum passes , this law becomes active '' . 
  so while it 's true that if the referendum had passed then that law would have been activated , the more salient fact is that parliament faced absolutely no restrictions on completely and immediately repealing that prior legislation . 
  that no parliament can bind its successors is at the heart of uk parliamentary sovereignty .
