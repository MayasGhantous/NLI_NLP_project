   and if the scots declared independence unilaterally , spain will block their eu membership . 
  and if the uk launch nuclear weapons at russia , russia will vaporise the entire country . 
  the scottish government would not hold an unsanctioned referendum in order to declare independence unilaterally . 
  they would do so because the reality is that the uk government , if presented with a well organised and fairly held referendum that indicated scotland wanted to leave , would comply . 
  a uk government that rejected a fairly held unsanctioned referendum would simply be guaranteeing success at the next sanctioned referendum . 
   scotland 's biggest trading partner is england which is hardly surprising , given several hundred years of political and economic union . 
  the same was also true of ireland at one point . 
  no uk referendum is ever `` officially binding '' . 
  the scottish government do not need permission from the uk government to hold a referendum . 
  the uk government could easily ignore the result of an unofficial referendum , exactly as they can an officially sanctioned one . 
   now you could hold your own referendum but westminster would almost certainly not recognise it . 
  westminster are under no obligation to recognise the result of * any * referendum in the uk , even ones they hold themselves . 
  that is the very essence of parliamentary sovereignty . 
  that westminster has the final say on * implementing * a referendum does not prohibit holyrood from * holding * a referendum . 
   yes they do . 
  otherwise you 'd get a catalonia situation where the unionist side just refuses to acknowledge the referendum , and then the government does n't acknowledge the result when the independence side wins . 
  no , they do n't - the situation is entirely different . 
  the spanish government believes that the spanish constitution prohibits the catalonian government from holding a referendum on secession . 
  the uk has no such restriction . 
   having said that , i ca n't really see a situation where the scottish government asks for another referendum and then is n't allowed to hold it . 
  i agree , and assume may does too . 
  refusing an official request for a referendum would simply drive support higher . 
   they 'd probably have to wait until after the brexit process is done , though . 
  i think it 's prudent to wait until a50 is actually invoked , and to see what shape the final settlement is going to be . 
  once that becomes clear then , assuming the deal is a bad one , i do n't think there 's any reason to wait for all of those negative consequences to play out in entirety though . 
   but portraying leave voting as an entirely english phenomenon , which to my eyes is what the original statement was doing , seems to me to be misrepresenting what happened . 
  the original statement was about the campaign and how it was driven , not how people eventually voted . 
  i would have to agree with op . 
  from outside england , brexit looked like a campaign that was driven almost entirely by the fears and desires of english nationalism . 
   it 's by no means guaranteed that scotland will be permitted another independence referendum all uk referendums are advisory - the scottish government does n't need permission to hold one . 
   i would dispute that it made no sense outside of england , considering how many non-english people voted for it . 
  the absolute number of people is not as significant as the percentage of the total population - and the percentage for leave was significantly lower than in england . 
   maybe its because i live in london but there is no way in hell this is as common as its made out to be . 
  london voted remain - it 's not representative of the uk as a whole . 
   and uk exporters . 
  business will be booming for some uk companies over the next few months . 
  assuming they , and their suppliers , do n't need to actually import anything to produce their goods . 
   sigh . . all merkel had to do was give cameron something on immigration and none of this would be happening . 
  there is literally nothing merkel could have given cameron that would have [ appeased the uk media ] ( http://www.antipope.org/charlie/pix/express-cover-montage.jpg ) . 
   i 'm curious about scotland . . is that the news snp was praying for ? 
  not really , no - it 's about the worst possible outcome economically for the uk . 
  the snp do n't believe that the uk must lose for scotland to win : if anything it 's the opposite . 
  the snp have done a pretty exhaustive job of [ exploring every option but independence ] ( http://www.gov.scot/resource/0051/00512073.pdf ) as an alternative , however may has not really given them much thought . 
  in addition there wo n't be any referendum in 2017 . 
  if may can somehow pull a rabbit out of the brexit catastrohat then fair play to her , perhaps there wo n't need to be one in the short term . 
  but if you assume that brexit negotiations are going to either go badly , put the uk entirely outside the eu/efta , or further harm the uk economy ( or any combination of the same ) then a referendum in 2018 looks quite likely . 
   this is , by definition , an unpopular party . 
  i think there 's a distinction between being unpopular and being unsuccessful , particularly under a winner-takes-all system like fptp . 
   clearly , they only attract repulsive candidates . 
  i can only speak for the candidates i 'm familiar with in scotland , in which case - yes , absolutely . 
   but there is not a single constituency in the uk which ever put a ukip candidate ( farage included -- he tried multiple times ) in parliament . 
  the man is prodigiously unpopular . 
  their lack of electoral success is entirely down to the fptp voting system . 
  they received 12.6 % of the vote in 2015 , [ the third highest party ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results ) , but failed to translate that into seats due to that vote being geographically distributed rather than concentrated . 
  they came in second place in 120 constituencies , 18 % of the total seats , but under fptp coming second place gets you nothing . 
  farage is , unfortunately , popular across huge parts of the uk ( both geographically and socially ) .

   it was so bad it was almost laughable . 
  the coverage given to the `` vote no borders '' campaign group [ was particularly problematic ] ( https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2014/05/bbc-propaganda-hits-new-all-time-low/ ) . 
  they were depicted as a grass-roots campaign from concerned citizens , in reality they were widely considered to be a construction of acanchi ( a corporate pr company who specialise in generating positive publicity for regimes in the middle east ) . 
  the rather dubious nature of their `` grass-roots '' funding and who their key figures actually were was all discoverable with a few minutes on google . 
  the bbc ( and indeed other news organisations ; the guardian and the telegraph in particular ) simply ran with the story as offered to them , no questions asked . 
  the problem of course is that there are always conspiracy theorists decrying any mainstream organisation as being part of some sinister plot , and so any attempt to point out flaws in these organisations is regularly painted as being part of that movement . 
  however the bbc ( and indeed any reputable journalist ) has a duty to question , not simply to regurgitate . 
  there has been precious little evidence of that [ since 2003 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_kelly_\\ ( weapons_expert \\ ) #contact _ with_andrew_gilligan ) . 
   this is n't entirely true , if the scottish government constantly pushes for referendum after referendum until they get the desired outcome it 's not really fair on the ~ ~ british ~ ~ scottish taxpayer ... 
  the cost of the 2014 referendum was paid for by the scottish government . 
   they should be allowed to have another one due to the eu vote , but after that they need to accept the outcome and move on . 
  if a government `` constantly pushes for referendum after referendum '' then the electorate are perfectly capable of punishing them at the ballot box . 
  conversely , if a government stands on a platform of calling a referendum if certain circumstances are met and those circumstances are met - as happened with the scottish government and brexit - then voters have every right to expect them to hold one . 
  alternative title : `` scottish government says an independent scotland would not have to apply as a new member state to join the eu '' ... the legal advice obtained by each government has , unsurprisingly , supported their own view . 
  the more interesting point is that now both governments have agreed the referendum terms , the ec have offered to provide an opinion on what would happen to an independent scotland . 
  however the ec will only provide that to the uk government , and the uk government is refusing to request it . 
  i think it depends on where you look - politicians in scotland are probably more favourable towards the eu than politicians in england . 
   but scotland does n't necessarily want to leave the uk , only its regional government does determining if scotland does or does not want to leave the uk is the point of the referendum surely ? 
  the electoral system for the scottish government was designed to try and prevent any one party from having a majority . 
  that the pro-independence party have achieved a majority despite that , and were thus able to start the referendum process , does indicate they have support . 
  it would also be more correct to describe the scottish government as scotland 's devolved government . 
  the structure of local government is different in scotland to the rest of the uk ( councils vs counties ) , but scotland is not a `` region '' within the uk . 
  the concept of being `` genetically scottish '' is entirely alien to me , sorry . 
  we are a mixture of people from the rest of the uk/northern europe , plus recent immigrants . 
  where someone 's parents came from really does n't count . 
  [ mr singh ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghsfx3bi1d8 ) was n't born here , but he 's as scottish as i am . 
  conversely tony blair was born here , but most people would agree he is only * technically * scottish . 
  scotland has been around for about 1300 years , and in a union with the rest of the uk for about 300 . 
  that 's a slightly different situation than your house . 
  being scottish is essentially cultural rather than ethnic . 
  the vast majority of scots are white , but your accent/opinions are a much stronger guide to `` how scottish '' you would be considered ( at least in scotland ) . 
  many americans ( possibly canadians too ? ), 
  seem to believe it is somehow genetic - the idea of having some distant ancestor who was born in scotland , and that therefore you 're `` 1/8th scottish '' seems nonsensical . 
  edit : typos, 
  the timing of an eu withdrawal from the uk ( the leading conservative party are talking about a referendum around 2015 ) may also have an impact on the scottish independence referendum in 2014 . 
  within the uk anti-eu sentiment ( not all , but imo most of it ) is strongest in england , and the prospect of scotland being pulled out of the eu via the uk may encourage more ` yes ' votes in 2014 . 
  it would be an unusual situation , scotland remaining inside the eu with the ruk exiting , but entirely plausible given current domestic politics in the uk .
