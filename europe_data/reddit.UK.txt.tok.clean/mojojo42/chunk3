   we both know that if the report had been positive to salmond 's position that it would 've been published and publicised so fast that it 'd make your head spin , so let 's at least be honest about that . 
  of course - most politicians will highlight things that back up their argument and try and steer clear of areas that are problematic . 
  that 's hardly unique to the snp , or alex salmond personally . 
  however , in this case the cost related to a [ foi request ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/scotland/435611/scottish-national-party-wasted-20-000-on-legal-row-over-eu-advice ) querying the existence of a report - not the cost of producing a report . 
  are you referring to a different secret report ? 
   if scotland leaves the uk it also leaves the eu as the uk is a eu member state , scotland is n't . 
  i do n't think anyone is disputing that . 
  the distinction is really that once scotland has its referendum then there would be 18 months before the currently proposed independence date . 
  given that the uk has [ agreed to abide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edinburgh_agreement_\\ ( 2012 \\ ) ) by the referendum result , the eu is then faced with the ( unprecedented ) situation that part of an eu member state is going to leave that state but also wishes to be part of the eu . 
  the eu project is , at its heart , about creating links between countries that are difficult if not impossible to unravel . 
  if scotland were set on leaving the eu then this process , however difficult , would have to be done . 
  but given the desire to stay in the eu , and the existing presence as part of the uk ( which removes the most complex part of accession - transposing eu legislation into the domestic legal system ) , it seems very unlikely that the best solution would be to do the work of extracting scotland from the eu only to undo it shortly after . 
   i am sure all the member states will accept scotland . 
  but on what terms ? 
  will they let it have the same opt outs as the uk gets ? 
  the uk has [ three opt-outs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#former_opt-outs ) : * schengen . 
  also granted to ireland , and i do n't see any particular reason why it would n't be granted to scotland . 
  its only land border is with another non-schengen country ( ruk ) , so from the rest of the eu 's pov there is no material difference if scotland is in schengen or not . 
  the uk has a partial opt-out from the [ afsj ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/area_of_freedom,_security_and_justice ) but this is essentially the implications of schengen for cross-border policing . 
  * euro . 
  also granted to denmark , and given the political situation in the uk ( there is no great demand for the euro ) i do n't see any reason why that would n't be carried forward . 
  if it was n't , there is no requirement for immediate adoption . 
  bulgaria , the czech republic , croatia , lithuania , hungary , poland , romania , and sweden are all in the eu but not the eurozone - without any formal opt-out . 
  * [ cfr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union ) . 
  the uk opt-out was primarily to ensure that uk citizens could not take cases to the european court of justice . 
  the [ treaty itself ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf ) is pretty straightforward - no death penalty , no torture , intellectual property exists , innocent until proven guilty , etc. 
  the uk also enjoys a rebate , which is currently worth about # 5bn ( so say # 500m to scotland , on a roughly per-capita basis ) . 
  however the rebate is based on the amount that the uk pays in to the eu relative to the amount it receives ( if it pays in # 100 , and receives # 70 , it gets 2/3 the difference - or # 20 ) , has been reduced by 20 % , is likely to be reduced further , and would be much less significant given that scotland would make a smaller contribution to eu funding . 
  the uk 's opt-outs/special treatment are things that are either unlikely to be an issue ( schengen ) , are not in fact an immediate requirement ( euro ) , or would not be not particularly significant to scotland ( cfr and rebate ) . 
   you 're right ; but the scottish government did commission an independent report on the subject , using public funds - then refused to publish the results . 
  most governments tend to use use public funds to commission their reports ...  the reason the snp contested this release was because they believed that the scottish ministerial code prevents from from revealing legal advice . 
  while i do n't particularly agree with that argument , it 's worth noting that scottish labour also used this argument several times when they were in office . 
  indeed , this argument has also been used by the uk government for [ far more significant ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2842789.stm ) cases in the past . 
   if the catalan vote were to be first , i would say that would have been beneficial to both campaigns . 
  i would say the opposite actually . 
  the `` spain will veto eu membership '' bogeyman gets regular play in the media in the uk , and if catalonia voted yes then spanish politicians will go into meltdown . 
  `` state '' has two meanings in english - it can mean either california or france . 
  something like france might be also called a `` nation-state '' , or a `` country '' . 
  but in general if someone says `` portugal is a state '' then what they mean is `` portugal is an independent country '' , not `` portugal is an area within a larger country '' . 
   would you agree that they have n't lived up to what they said they would provide then ? 
  i think you just have a different expectation over what `` great detail '' means . 
  i suspect what you are looking for is something that would only appear after a yes vote - a statement from the ec , the uk , and scotland detailing the process of accession . 
  that the referendum process has been agreed and is underway means the rest of the eu will be paying close attention from now on , but a definitive `` this is what is going to happen '' statement will not happen until it absolutely has to . 
  if scotland votes yes then a way is found , if scotland votes no then the eu avoids having to come up with ( as with germany ) almost certainly be a one-off solution for a one-off event . 
  there clearly needs to be some negotiation over what membership would look like , but at this stage people are simply discussing the principle of membership . 
  given that there is no significant desire to leave , and the proposed uk secession date is 18 months after the referendum , it seems extremely likely that if the vote is yes then a process can be defined at that point . 
  harmonising national legislation with eu law is normally the biggest delaying factor , however that process has already been done for scotland : scotland is already within the eu , as part of the uk . 
  there is no precedent for an eu member state dissolving into its constituent countries but neither was there a precedent for german reunification . 
  if devo-max was on offer ( probably the first concrete step to a federal uk ) , i think it would have won . 
  i would certainly have considered it as it has many of the benefits of independence while still retaining some of the benefits of being part of the uk . 
  unfortunately that option was rejected by the three westminster parties and so the question is simply yes or no . 
  no country can exist without others today - and they do all benefit from that mutual cooperation . 
  however that does n't mean they must necessarily be part of the same entity . 
  scotland benefits from being a member of the uk today , but it also benefits from being a member of the eu . 
  a `` strength in numbers '' argument makes a lot of sense , but the eu is a more significant organisation than the uk . 
   the snp got a majority because they give free shit to the scots . 
  i do n't know the details of the matter financially , but scots get a better deal than i do . 
  it 's pretty straightforward - the scottish government choses to spend money differently . 
  the majority of the money spent in scotland is raised in scotland , sent to the uk treasury , then returned via the block grant . 
  scotland is currently running a deficit ( it spends more than it raises ) , however so is the uk . 
  this is not new : the uk has been running a deficit for about 30 years . 
  as a proportion of gdp , scotland 's deficit is about [ 5.9 % of gdp ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/publications/2013/05/4084/14 ) vs the uk 's 7.6 % . 
  taking something like free prescriptions for example , people in wales or northern ireland also get a better deal than you do - the relevant health services there also choose to subsidise it . 
  the nhs in england does not , however that is really a matter for politicians in england . 
   if they join the pound , they avoid that mess but have no control on monetary policy . 
  the same is true of the eurozone incidentally - austria abides by the ecb 's monetary policy . 
   i think the theory is that laying out your breaking point before you begin negotiations i think it 's a mistake to view it as a `` breaking point '' - it 's just a date . 
  i presume it was picked because it 's about 18 months on from the referendum ( so slightly longer than typical secessions ) , and on an anniversary of the union of the crowns ( so slightly interesting from a historical point of view ) . 
  there will almost certainly be some aspects of negotiations which ca n't be concluded by that point ( personally i think it 's unlikely the ruk government will be able to arrange for the return of trident in that time , short of parking them in a us/french port ) , but as with most things political enough can be done that makes that as useful a point as any to say `` it 's done '' . 
   well that 's really going to hurt their negotiating position , seems a bit foolish to name such an early date at such an early point . 
  yes , that seems to be [ the official line ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q= `` weaken + the + scottish + government 's + negotiating + position '' ) . 
  i do n't find that argument very convincing - claims that the process is [ taking too long ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/scottish-politics/9007168/david-cameron-scottish-nationalists-want-neverendum-not-referendum.html ) have been going on for over a year now , so why not pick a date ? 
  is the theory that if a date is picked , the uk government will simply stall negotiations because they think the scottish government would give up anything to meet that date ? 
  threats like that do n't really sound like a good way to convince people that the uk has scotland 's best interests at heart . 
  most of the structures you might consider as unified across the uk are in fact already separate - the health service , the legal system , education , the fire & police services , environmental agencies , many aspects of government , etc. 
  some of these were created during devolution , most of them have always been separate . 
  i suspect it 's quite likely that that other bodies could have some kind of short-term arrangement to simplify the transition . 
  for example , scotland would need an equivalent to the uk body that manages driving licenses . 
  but in the short term it could simply agree to pay # x for the next 5 years and lease that service from ruk . 
  the scottish government 's previous publication looked at how long the process typically took . 
  they found that in the 30 countries that have become independent since 1945 , the average length of time between a referendum and secession was about 15 months . 
  ** scotland ** * a major industrial dispute ( owner threatened to close entire plant after workers went on strike ) [ was resolved ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/columnists/trade-unionism-the-labour-party-and-scotland-will-pay-price-for-the-grangemouth-i.22524694 ) , at least temporarily . 
  * [ still game ] ( http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/theatre/still-game-barman-boabby-says-2645024 ) is back . 
  * a ` psychic ' bus driver refused to stop to pick up schoolchildren as he had a vision of '' [ something bad ] ( http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/clairovoyant-bus-driver-sacked-after-2482356 ) '' happening if he did . 
  he is now an ex-bus driver . 
  * permission for fracking has been [ ruled out ] ( http://www.utilityweek.co.uk/news/scotland-to-block-fracking-on-environmental-grounds/934082 ) . 
  * two 747s had a [ near collision ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/nearmiss-in-skies-over-scotland-as-two-boeing-747-jumbo-jets-ignore-urgent-air-traffic-control-instructions-and-turn-towards-each-other-8893847.html ) ( actually back in june , but the report was released this week ) . 
  * several alleged irish republicans [ arrested under terrorism legislation ] ( http://news.stv.tv/west-central/245591-irish-republican-terror-suspects-48-hour-detention-extended/ ) . 
  that is a loaded question - the fire service do not respond to emergencies on the basis of how `` worthy '' someone is . 
  although doctors and fire fighters are expected to help those who can not help themselves , i do not think it 's useful to see them as `` duty-bound '' to carry out that role . 
  they have a demanding profession but it is one they do by choice . 
  if they believe their conditions of employment are illegal then , yes , they could simply quit and let it become someone else 's problem . 
  a strike is normally considered to be a last resort , to demonstrate the desire to work - but under reasonable conditions . 
   people verifiably died where they would otherwise have been saved . 
  that does not seem to be the case . 
  the eight deaths [ during that strike ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2477747.stm ) were : * a family of four in a rural location , attended by the same part-time crew that would have attended had there been no strike . 
  * one rta , where the victim was killed instantly . 
  * one elderly woman , where firefighters broke their strike to attend . 
  * one elderly man , extracted within 6 minutes but died from smoke inhalation . 
  * one elderly man , although no information is given on the circumstances .
