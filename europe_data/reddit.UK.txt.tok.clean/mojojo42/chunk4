  the last case is arguably the one where the strike did have an impact , as despite the fire being half a mile from a fire station the army crew had to travel seven miles to attend ( having said that , this fire station has now been closed due to cuts ) . 
  glasgow is on the west coast of scotland . 
  sectarianism there is almost always linked to football . 
  that would be northern ireland . 
  the senate dates from the 1930s . 
  i do n't deny they believe that scotland would be better off within the uk ; that is their reason for existing . 
  however i do n't think you can jump from that to saying that it 's their focus as a campaign ( scottish labour 's own former leader believes they focus on '' [ fear and scare tactics ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-independence-ditch-no-campaign-mcleish-1-2992714 ) '' - i find it hard to disagree with that assessment ) . 
  a good example would be ed miliband 's conference speech last week , where he discussed the example of a woman from glasgow who required specialist treatment at a hospital in england . 
  her two key points were `` i would ask alex salmond how we would pay for the nhs '' and `` could i keep the ongoing help and support i receive in england '' . 
  the scottish nhs is currently devolved , so it would be paid for in the same way as it is today - primarily by revenue generated in scotland . 
  she would also continue to be eligible for the same treatment - as with any patient at that specialist unit , the bill would be sent back to the health service that referred her ( as they do today with irish patients ) . 
  better together also released the infamous '' [ 500 questions ] ( http://b.3cdn.net/better/38a382b210f856a0e2_5zm6b1yew.pdf ) '' document , including such critical issues as `` would a separate scotland enter teams into the olympics and paralympics ? '', 
  and `` what work has been carried out to assess the attractiveness of a separate scotland to internet service providers ? '' . 
  i find it hard to see that as a serious attempt at positive campaigning . 
  yes scotland have compiled [ a list of responses ] ( https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yesscotland/pages/1755/attachments/original/1373290492/yes_a4_project_fear_july13.pdf ) for those that actually got some play in the media . 
  perhaps a partisan view , but they do provide sources for the stories and a reasonable sounding answer to each . 
  if you ask me what better together could do , i would like to hear positive stories about what further political devolution the labour/conservative parties plan ? 
  or why reducing healthcare devolution ( floated by labour last week ) are beneficial for scotland ? 
  so far this has not been forthcoming . 
   that 's not actually true . 
  probably the single greatest strength of the ` no ' campaign is that it 's positive . 
  that 's an interesting view . 
  if you compare the last five things from their official twitter feeds , you have : ** better together ** * pro-union business leaders claim they are too frightened of snp retaliation to voice opinions * what the experts say about the snp 's dodgy pension statistics ... * what would independence mean for our world-leading armed forces and security services ? 
  * scottish gov says our population is ageing faster than ruk , but sturgeon says it 's a myth . 
  who is right ? 
  * lots of coverage today about the snp 's bogus claims on defence in a go-it-alone scotland ** yes scotland ** * one week on since the #indyrally , here 's a reminder of the day * defence forces designed for #scotland - and to support our service personnel * yes , to an economic recovery that benefits all * an official letter from the ( uk government ) department of work and pensions says your pension is safe in an independent scotland * george osborne 's challenge to banker bonus cap will cost taxpayer # 1,000,000  campaigns which focus on positive things always do better than ones that focus on negatives , it has more of a staying power in peoples minds and is more compelling . 
  i think so , yes . 
   echr the ` e ' stands for ` europe '' , and in the week of the party conference that is probably as much justification as is needed . 
  this kind of politicking happens with every government around their conference time so normally you could put it down to pandering to the audience . 
  however david cameron has also called a referendum on withdrawing from the eu itself after 2015 , and theresa may ( the home secretary ; essentially immigration minister ) also supports the move , so it is entirely possible that it may happen . 
  the annual conservative party conference [ started today ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10342376/conservative-party-conference-2013-day-one-as-it-happened.html ) . 
   good rant , but know that the gibraltar conflict is much bigger in the uk than in spain . 
  it does n't really get a great deal of coverage in the uk either . 
  the official colour is pantone 300 ( light blue ) . 
  the union flag uses a darker blue ( pantone 280 ) but it 's incorrect to say that 's incorrect - prior to 2003 , there was [ no official colour ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_scotland#design ) . 
  ** scotland ** * scottish woman [ arrested in peru ] ( http://news.stv.tv/scotland/236482-more-details-of-drugs-gang-peru-girls-say-made-them-carry-cocaine/ ) with over # 1m of cocaine . 
  * the edinburgh festival 's director has vetoed any references to the referendum in [ next year 's festival ] ( http://news.stv.tv/politics/236509-edinburgh-festival-director-says-no-plays-on-independence-referendum/ ) , while also requesting that shows should focus on `` themes of nationalism and nationhood '' . 
  such as the commonwealth , or world war one . 
  * scottish labour 's heavy-handed approach to alleged corruption appears to be [ unravelling slightly ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/16/tom-watson-accuses-labour-injustice-falkirk ) , giving the uk labour party 's leader even more problems . 
  * the right-wing `` scottish defence league '' [ performed a protest march ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-23738234 ) through edinburgh , although what exactly they are protesting is unclear . 
  that their two biggest flags are both english ( from the `` blackburn casuals '' and `` sunderland division '' - blackburn and sunderland are both in england ) supports the idea that the sdl is pretty much one angry man from glasgow and a busload of people from the [ english defence league ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/20/police-make-arrests-after-voilence_n_3628526.html ) . 
  * [ world pipe band championships ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-23726288 ) in glasgow . 
  8,000 bagpipes and no earplugs . 
  * first scotland-england football match since 1989 . 
  scotland lost two goals to three , but england ended up with washing-up liquid [ in their fountains ] ( http://deadspin.com/a-photo-tribute-to-drunk-scottish-fans-1141316242 ) - i think everyone knows who really won . 
  the uk registry of names is a registry of spelling , not a registry of `` these names are spelt differently but * really * they 're the same '' . 
  the dm 's argument would carry more weight if they had coalesced all names that sound similar . 
  i 'm sure some people with those names would consider them to be distinct ( s\u00e9amus vs seumas , say ) , but only combining muslim names so you can write an `` omg muslims are taking over '' headline is pretty transparent . 
  muhammad was actually in 19th place . 
  to come up with the `` 2nd most popular '' , the daily mail also counted mohammed ( 26th ) and mohammad ( 60th ) to get a total of 7139 boys with variations of that name . 
  the most popular name was harry ( 7168 boys ) , although curiously they did not include variations of that name - such as henry ( 2928 ) or harrison ( 2224 ) . 
  the king of the picts was about to fight a battle against a larger army , so prayed for divine assistance - promising to make st andrews the patron saint of scotland if he was successful . 
  the next day he won the battle , saw an interesting cloud formation shaped like an x , and figured his prayers had been answered . 
  however the battle was in 832 ad , and this story first appeared around 1400 ad , so who really knows . 
  unfortunately it 's a [ global phenomenon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acid_throwing#epidemiology ) . 
  bangladesh is currently the location with the highest number of incidents , closely followed by india and cambodia . 
  what percentage of muslims would you say habitually indulge in these attacks ? 
  a `` wide spread trend '' sounds pretty high . 
  a far more likely cause is that the media love to sell fear , and idiots often copy what they see reported in the media . 
  records from that era are spotty at best , but most historians date it to somewhere around 840 ad . 
  why would you say that was `` ethnic '' , rather than `` cultural '' ? 
  initiatives like that are more about helping a niche language gain more speakers/not die off ( delete as appropriate ) , rather than making some claim about the ethnicity of people who can or ca n't speak it . 
   ambulance ca n't be used to transport the bodies . 
  nobody knew what to do , so they left the man in a bag with the police . 
  there are going to be some new procedures invented for this kind of situations . 
  presumably people have died while in transit in an ambulance before though ? 
  it seems weird that a doctor would n't have the authority to both pronounce death and ok a transfer to the hospital morgue . 
  ** scotland ** * [ pregnant panda ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-23625465 ) is pregnant ( maybe ) . 
  the cub will be going back to china eventually , as we only leased them , but not before it 's been addicted to irn bru . 
  * a `` dark skies '' [ national park ] ( http://www.forestry.gov.uk/darkskygalloway ) is getting ready for the perseids meteor shower . 
  * [ pride glasgow ] ( http://news.stv.tv/galleries/pride-glasgow-2013/ ) march in ... glasgow . 
  * proposals for tighter regulation over [ cold calling ] ( http://news.stv.tv/politics/235614-swinney-independent-scotland-would-tighten-regulation-on-cold-calling/ ) and [ payday loans ] ( http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/alex-salmond-called-cap-payday-2123834 ) ( cash loans with 5000 % annual interest rates , often given to people in debt to pay off other loans ) after independence ( both issues currently reserved to westminster , which had promised to `` curb irresponsible behaviour '' but has since announced that they will not legislate to [ cap rates ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2352101/payday-loan-firms-wont-forced-cut-rates-despite-government-promising-crackdown.html ) ) . 
  * four-day [ dare protoplay ] ( http://news.stv.tv/tayside/235430-dundee-computer-games-festival-aims-to-unearth-next-lara-croft/ ) games development festival in dundee . 
  * ukip mep who described foreign aid as sending money to `` bongo-bongo land '' receives a free [ pair of bongos ] ( http://news.stv.tv/tayside/235357-godfrey-bloom-rainbow-music-sends-bongos-to-ukip-mep-after-interview/ ) . 
  * the [ edinburgh festival ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edinburgh_festival ) is underway , one of the world 's largest arts/cultural festivals that takes edinburgh 's population from 480k to over a million for the month of august ( thanks tuttle_not_buttle ! ) . 
  upside is lots of interesting cultural things to see , downside is that every pavement now feels 1/3rd its normal size . 
  ** scotland ** * [ tenements ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=55.875624,-4.291191&amp;spn=0.005357,0.023603&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=55.875319,-4.291415&amp;panoid=nebsdalqregpdf5jvlq1bq&amp;cbp=12,70.34,,0,-8.67 ) . 
  usually four or six flats with a common stairwell ( a `` close '' , pronounced `` that was close '' not `` did you close it '' ) . 
  a big chunk of the two largest cities ( glasgow and edinburgh ) use this style of building . 
  typically from the 1800s . 
  * [ old flats ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=55.882846,-4.225638&amp;spn=0.005356,0.023603&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=55.882845,-4.225641&amp;panoid=j8ai0lnuvdmj4h96ctwjca&amp;cbp=12,63.16,,0,-19.31 ) . 
  more common in glasgow , often built in the 1950s , lots of small flats in a shared building . 
  quite a few have been knocked down , and replaced with ... * [ modern flats ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=55.984939,-3.1917&amp;spn=0.042733,0.188828&amp;t=m&amp;z=13&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=55.984641,-3.191334&amp;panoid=zp8mrgwjur7hvhs0pzw23q&amp;cbp=12,283.35,,0,-11.78 ) . 
  your typical `` housing boom '' development ; a lot are currently empty , as they were bought and sold as an investment rather than a place to live . 
  * [ `` modern '' houses ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=55.942231,-3.983746&amp;spn=0.023721,0.047207&amp;t=m&amp;z=15&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=55.942188,-3.983905&amp;panoid=ofi7nnogqudvidzcaxhzyw&amp;cbp=12,27,,0,9.25 ) . 
  most commonly two houses with a shared wall ( `` semi-detached '' ) , sometimes a stand-alone house ( `` detached '' ) , often a row of houses ( `` terrace '' ) . 
  could be anything from the 1950s onwards , these date from [ the 1980s ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytjg627ogru ) . 
  * [ modern houses ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=55.991176,-3.70196&amp;spn=0.085452,0.377655&amp;t=m&amp;z=12&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=55.991176,-3.70196&amp;panoid=z4lojhz074k_z3ja5pdxka&amp;cbp=12,73.8,,0,-0.65 ) . 
  small schemes of houses built in the 1990s/2000s . 
  these are probably the second most common building after tenements , in terms of the number of people living in them . 
  * [ cottages ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=57.896607,-5.156493&amp;spn=0.005075,0.023603&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=57.896611,-5.156497&amp;panoid=3dwir0qn7ouafwcf6yd1ow&amp;cbp=12,287.67,,0,8.92 ) . 
  often in mining or fishing communities , usually in a terrace , either bungalows or low two-storeys . 
  often built for local workers so they could be near their place of work . 
  * [ highlands & islands ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=57.334519,-6.060065&amp;spn=0.002577,0.011802&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=57.334392,-6.060093&amp;panoid=5gyomdsay45qhnxwk2m0ng&amp;cbp=12,120.86,,0,6.35 ) . 
  i hesitate to call them `` crofter 's cottages '' , but this is pretty typical of more rural communities . 
  upgraded with slate roofs rather than thatch , double glazing , extended , etc , but almost certainly a white-painted single-storey stone building with a pitched roof . 
  common themes ? 
  older buildings are stone with bad insulation , modern buildings are stone with bad insulation , you will happily pay extra for a south-facing house just to harvest those precious rays of sunshine . 
  unfortunately further electoral reform ( the `` devo-max '' option ) was vetoed by the three main parties at westminster ; so the referendum is simply a yes or no choice , and something more federal is off the table . 
  the uk voting system is based on '' [ first-past-the-post ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first-past-the-post_voting ) '' , so the actual number of people voting for a party only has a rough correlation with the number of mps that they get .
