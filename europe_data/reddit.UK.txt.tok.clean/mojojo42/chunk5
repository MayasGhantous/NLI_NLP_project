  i suspect if the uk elections used something more akin to proportional representation ( as per scottish elections , which use [ ams ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/additional_member_system ) ) then people would not feel quite so disconnected . 
  i do n't think the problem is not being able to sway the result ( sometimes you win , sometimes you lose ) , it 's more that you feel that your vote was disproportionally under-represented . 
  i do n't know much about wales or northern ireland so could n't really tell you how people there feel about the uk . 
  it does seem that people in places like the falklands or gibraltar often feel very passionately `` pro-uk '' , although personally i find the uk identity they seem to picture feels like somewhere else . 
   what 's the justification for independence if it 's not on an ethnic basis ? 
  i do n't know anything about this situation , but in scotland it 's about political autonomy - not ethnicity . 
  there is no such thing as a `` genetic scot '' . 
  having `` your own country on a map '' is much less important than finding yourself in an existing structure with characteristics or behaviour that you disagree with , yet lack the power to change ( over the last 50 years , there have been exactly two occasions where the number of mps from scotland affected the uk general election result ) . 
  it 's the equivalent of [ wliia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwm3ddrfvkm ) , it was originally a uk show that was exported to the us . 
  mock the week is much more about stand-ups , wliia was more improvisation . 
  sometimes about the news , more often than not just audience suggestions . 
   just go to / r/scotland and read all of the pro-union posts . 
  oh wait , there are none . 
  please come and post some . 
  you 'll get my upvote . 
  82 % would want to remain part of an independent scotland ; the context of the poll is the hypothetical question of `` if scotland became independent , should the islands remain part of scotland or break away and return to ruk '' . 
  when people say `` scotland wo n't have nukes '' , what they primarily mean is that we wo n't have the uk 's trident system based 50 miles outside our largest city . 
  the nuclear weapons hosted by nato are [ free-fall bombs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b61_nuclear_bomb ) dropped from planes ; they are essentially obsolete , and are unlikely to get moved around ( i.e. , moved further away from russia ) . 
  it 's worth remembering that nato nuclear sharing is pretty obviously in conflict with the npt - those weapons are likely to reduce further in number on those grounds alone . 
  it does cost money , but if 90 % of your prescription users are either 2 or 82 ( and hence unlikely to be able to pay ) then your population is more significant . 
  10 % of a population of 60 million means 6 million people are providing revenue ; 10 % of a population of 5 million means only 500k people are . 
  prescriptions currently bring in about # 500 million in england , so charging for them in scotland would raise about # 50 million - that 's not a significant expenditure for a government . 
  you can find the current scottish government revenue and expenditure in the [ gers 2011-12 ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/statistics/browse/economy/gers ) report . 
  given the current uk structure , identifying excise revenue within the uk ( i assume that 's what you mean - taxes on scotland/ruk trade ? ), 
  is unfortunately not an exact science . 
  the way scotland is currently funded is that all revenue generated in scotland is sent to the uk treasury , and a yearly `` block grant '' is returned ( of a roughly similar value , although there is no direct link between the two ) . 
  essentially , yes . 
  scotland is running a deficit at the moment - but a smaller deficit than the uk as a whole . 
  taking something like prescription charges , around [ 90 % of them ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21629363 ) are also dispensed for free in england , as most of the people who use this service are either children or elderly ( and so qualify for a waiver ) . 
  the nhs in scotland felt that the overhead of means-testing would cost more than it would save , given the smaller population , and so it is cheaper to dispense them without charge . 
  assuming the referendum passes , scotland would - like any country - need to live within its means . 
  but to put things in perspective , we currently spend about [ # 3bn per year ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11719594 ) in scotland dealing with the effects of excessive alcohol consumption . 
  that problem needs to be fixed . 
  unfortunately the federal idea ( devo-max ) was vetoed by the main westminster parties - so the vote is simply yes or no . 
  imo devo-max would have been the conservative 's best approach to defusing the snp 's strengths . 
  i suspect more people would have voted for it , purely on the grounds that it sounds like a safer option . 
   how so ? 
  the scottish government provides free prescriptions and subsidises higher education ( paid for by scottish taxpayers , not subsidies from ruk ) . 
  it is aiming for 100 % of electricity and 11 % of heat to come from renewables by 2020 ( electricity is currently at 35 % ; the uk target for 2020 is 30 % ) . 
  they have proposed a written constitution , the removal of nuclear weapons , and elections are run using a proportional representation system . 
  the smoking ban was introduced a year earlier than the rest of the uk , and they plan to introduce minimum alcohol pricing and plain packaging for cigarettes . 
  i support some of these , in some form or another , but the significant point is that these are almost all the direct opposite of the policies of the main parties at westminster . 
   independence will make one be financially better or worse off . 
  it is unlikely both countries become equally richer independence is not about competing to see `` who 's the best '' . 
  one country does not have to lose for the other to gain . 
  edit : typo, 
  much as it pains me to link to wos , unfortunately scotland 's contribution to uk general elections has only affected the result [ on two occasions ] ( http://wingsland.podgamer.com/?p=13513 ) . 
  yes , and yes . 
  i think it would beneficial for both scotland and ruk . 
  politically i think the two countries are diverging , and have been for some time . 
  that is not to say they are necessary `` left wing '' and `` right wing '' countries , more that what society considers to be important is different in each . 
  it 's quite common now in uk media too - i assumed it was an american import ? 
  previously we would have said `` written off '' . 
  it 's normally within a few minutes but i do n't think there 's any guarantee at the customer level . 
  i ca n't find the link but i think i read once that any time under 3 hours is considered acceptable , and they might even bump it to the next day if they had to . 
  you 'd need to pay ( # 20 ? ), 
  for a service like chaps if you want a definitive same-day transfer . 
  most banks in the uk now use the [ faster payments ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/faster_payments_service ) system which sends electronic transfers through in a couple of hours . 
  cheques are still available , but for recurring purchases most businesses try and get you onto a monthly electronic transfer by giving you a small discount ( or making cheque payments more expensive , depending on how you want to look at it ) . 
  i guess you can probably still pay for things in shops using cheques but i ca n't remember the last time i saw someone doing it . 
  99 % of in-person transactions are either cash or [ chip and pin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chip_and_pin ) ( swipe credit/debit card and enter your pin code ) . 
  there 's a picture of the van [ here ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/26/racist-van-home-office-immigration_n_3658580.html ) . 
  ** scotland ** * the weather has ceased its temporary insanity and is [ back to normal ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-23483394 ) * scottish government funding development of a [ gaelic dictionary ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/scotland/comments/1j34u3/scottish_government_pledge_2m_to_new_online/ ) * new [ war memorial ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-23469745 ) opened for scottish soldiers who died in the korean war * a '' [ labour for independence ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-23472774 ) '' group is started within the ( nominally ) anti-independence labour party * man convicted after [ suspending up a petrol generator from the ceiling ] ( http://news.stv.tv/tayside/234172-mans-diy-power-plant-could-have-killed-himself-and-his-neighbours/ ) of his 14th floor flat to cut his electricity bills and/or kill everyone around him * a [ 236m industrial chimney ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-23479026 ) is about to get a lot shorter, 
   but the problem i have , as a scot , is this notion of `` them '' and us scots being fundamentally different to everyone else . 
  i do n't think the argument is really that the people are different in the sense of being better or worse . 
  `` nationalism '' in scotland does not exist to anything like the level that has caused civil wars elsewhere in europe - people can enjoy being scottish without needing to feel superior to others . 
  but there are clearly differences between scotland and the other countries in the uk . 
  many of the services that non-brits think of as `` state '' services have parallel , but separate , implementations in each country - the nhs , the police , the fire service , the government , etc ( largely stemming from the presence of a separate legal system ) . 
  taking europe as an example , there is negligible support for ukip in scotland - and conservatives are pretty thin on the ground . 
  while scotland might not be any more pro-europe than most of the uk , it 's clearly less anti-europe than some of the uk political parties . 
  if that translates into the opportunity to go our own way , and to finally have a less confrontational relationship with the eu , why not ? 
  it 's worth remembering that the snp have a policy of abstaining from votes at westminster that do n't affect scotland . 
  the issue is not really `` scotland can vote on english matters '' , it 's `` labour/conservatives/libdems will vote on english matters '' . 
   would the finances even stack up for public services and pensions etc without the any uk input ? 
  yes , the current figures ( [ gers 2011-12 ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/resource/0041/00415871.pdf ) ) show that scotland pretty much spends what it earns . 
  it runs a smaller deficit than the uk as a whole . 
   would they use the euro or informally use the pound without any ability to input on bank of england policy ? 
  the currency after independence would be sterling . 
  the boa is , like all uk assets , part paid for by scottish taxpayers - how that share is settled is tbd , but it could include a seat on the mpc . 
  even if not , it 's extremely unlikely that the boe would ( or could ) pursue a policy which damaged scotland without also damaging ruk - targets for growth , borrowing , and inflation are all pretty similar . 
   these are the questions that matter , but sadly they are not being address by the ` yes ' campaign , it just seems they brush the questions aside and revert to nationalistic chest thumping . 
  there 's plenty of information available on the above . 
  the [ scottish government ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/ ) website has lots of information ( there 's a series of publications under the '' [ scotland 's future ] ( http://www.scotreferendum.com/scotlands-future/ ) '' link ) , the yes campaign has a [ whole section ] ( http://www.yesscotland.net/undecided_responses ) like this . 
  or come ask in / r/scotland ? 
   i do n't like that 16 yr olds can vote , are they well informed ? 
  lowering the voting age to 16 is , in scotland , lowering the voting age to the existing age of legal adulthood . 
  it will not greatly enlarge the electorate , and [ most of them may vote no ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-22745855 ) . 
  i think they 're probably as well informed as the average 18 year old ; you can find people voting for spurious reasons at any age . 
   is the population as a whole well informed ? 
  i think so , there 's been pretty regular coverage in the media for some time . 
   it would take decades to sort out . 
  since 1945 , 30 new states have become independent after holding a referendum . 
  the average time between their referendum and their independence day was 15 months . 
  it 's worth pointing that the payments from `` the rest of the uk '' also includes scotland ... we do have to pay tax here too . 
   oil currently makes up about 18 % of public sector revenue in scotland ( about # 10bn per year ) , with comparable amounts coming from income tax , vat , and ni payments . 
  the problem with looking back at the past for what-ifs is that you can pick the data to suit your case : if scotland had been independent for the last 25 years , how likely is it that they would have purchased trident ? 
  or participated in afghanistan/iraq ? 
  both of those have been extremely expensive projects ( # 2bn annual maintenance for trident , # 40bn for afghanistan alone ) , but neither sound like the kind of thing a nation of 5 million would ( or could ) do . 
  all countries have to live within their means - i do n't think scotland would be any different . 
   that ' 40 % rule ' seems very arbitrary .
