  why is it at 40 % , and not for example 45 , 50 , or even 60 % ? 
  it was set as 40 % because that was felt most likely to thwart the result without appearing too obvious . 
  the actual percentage of the electorate that voted yes turned out to be 33 % , which is pretty typical for uk elections ( margaret thatcher won the subsequent uk election , which was triggered by protests against the 40 % rule , on 33 % of the uk electorate ) . 
   then there are the post-independence issues . 
  if there is another ` no ' how long until the next one ? 
  should we be doing this every 20 years or so ? 
  eventually there might be a ` yes ' , such as now . 
  what do we do then ? 
  can we have another referendum to get back into the union in 20 years if we do n't like it ? 
  will england allow for that ? 
  those are questions every country faces - even if you vote for something today , future generations may decide to do things differently . 
  that 's ok .  if i voted ` no ' this time and the referendum is won by the ` yes ' block , do n't i have the right to vote at a later date to get back into the union ? 
  why should all these ` yes ' voters get several attempts , yet those referendums end when i am suddenly in the ` minority ' for the first time ? 
  declining my wish to vote to get back into the uk is undemocratic . 
  if you want to provide a party campaigning on those grounds then , sure , why not ? 
  if you can convince enough people to vote for you then you 'll get your wish . 
  personally i feel that scotland would benefit more from a union with the rest of europe than it would from the current union with the uk . 
  no union is required to last forever . 
  it 's worth noting that the structure of the devolved scottish government was specifically designed to encourage coalitions , and to make a majority government hard to achieve . 
  one of the architects of devolving power to scotland did so because he believed it would `` kill independence stone dead '' , and yet here we are - a centre-left party dedicated to independence has won the last two scottish government elections , and won a majority in 2011 . 
   imo all thise nonsense has mostly to do with people getting sucked into nationalism and scottish exceptionalism ( this phrase is a sad joke ) . 
  scotland is filled with fat people . 
  it is a relatively poor country . 
  i disagree about the nationalism ( imo modern scottish politics is simply driven by a wish for more progressive policies than the rest of the uk ) , but it is true that we have serious public health issues . 
  both with diet , and with alcohol ( we spend # 3.6 bn a year , in scotland , on alcohol abuse alone ) . 
  those have been with us for quite some time , and the uk 's current political structure has not made much headway in addressing them . 
   i live in norway atm and the difference between here and scotland is huge . 
  scotland , like ireland , should realise they do n't have endless money . 
  the irish found that out the hard way , i guess scotland must too . 
    regardless , if scotland does vote for independence , good luck . 
  i shall not shed a tear should it all go to shit and scotland becomes another toothless celtic tiger . 
  takk !, 
   the reserves in the north sea will be unlikely to be fully scotland 's in the first place the boundary between scotland and the rest of the uk is [ already defined ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_adjacent_waters_boundaries_order_1999 ) . 
  part of the north sea falls under scottish law , part of it falls under english law . 
  most of the oil fields are located in the scottish portion of the uk 's eez , however most of the gas fields are located in the english portion . 
   scotland relies heavily on funding from the uk to have things like free universities and pharmaceuticals , with only 5 million people living there , and even less in the higher tax brackets , how would scotland afford these measures ? 
  the same way they do just now - from scottish taxpayers ? 
  scotland is currently funded by the `` block grant '' - tax revenue from scotland is sent to westminster , and once a year westminster transfer funds back to scotland . 
  at present scotland is , like the rest of the uk , running a deficit ( albeit a smaller deficit than the uk overall ) . 
  but essentially scotland puts in what it gets back - the scottish government just choses to spend that money differently . 
  i believe the snp have said that , if the vote is a yes , that would become the standard voting age for future elections ( setting the voting age is currently a reserved power so they can only do so for this election after getting approval from westminster ) . 
  i do n't know what the process for postal voting would be , sorry - maybe there 's some information on the electoral commission website ? 
  as i understand it , the process is going to be exactly like the 1997 devolution referendum ( except for the voting age ) . 
   this involves allowing 16-17 year old people vote at the referendum the [ age of legal capacity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_legal_capacity_\\ ( scotland \\ ) _ act_1991 ) in scotland is 16 . 
  bringing the voting age in line with legal adulthood will increase the electorate by about 100,000 people : given that there are 4 million people who can currently vote , that 's only a 2.5 % increase . 
  polls suggest that this group are actually [ more likely to vote no ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-22745855 ) , yet it is happening regardless . 
   denying the 800 000 scots living in the rest of the uk to vote , yet allowing anyone living in scotland for the past 5 years ( including non nationals from abroad ) to vote . 
  since there is no definition of `` scottish citizenship '' yet , the franchise is pretty simple - if you 're registered to vote in scotland ( e.g. , you can vote for the scottish parliament ) then you 're allowed to vote . 
  there are about 800k people born in scotland who now live elsewhere in the uk , however around 400k people born outside of scotland now live in scotland . 
  there are always going to be edge cases , but if someone lived 5 years of their life in scotland and 35 in england why should they have a vote purely based on their place of birth ? 
   what is only 50 % of voters show up , and 51 % of them vote yes ? 
  that means scotland can get independent with 25 % of the vote !, 
  there should be a threshold of at least 60-70 % participation for the referendum to be valid , and then surely it should be quite a large majority wishing for independence ? 
  something like over 60 % at least !, 
  this is essentially the '' [ 40 % rule ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_devolution_referendum,_1979#.2240.25.22_rule ) '' that was introduced at the last-minute for the 1979 referendum . 
  the referendum should , like any other election , be based on a majority of those who vote - not a majority of those who could vote , but choose not to . 
   the gimmick to allow 16 and 17 year olds to vote one off is bullshit . 
  the age of legal capacity ( legal adulthood ) is 16 in scotland vs 18 in the rest of the uk . 
  if you are old enough to be treated like an adult by society , you should have a say in how that society is run . 
  if you remain registered to vote in scotland ( for all elections , not just the referendum ) then you would be allowed to vote . 
  unfortunately the uk government position is that to discuss what might happen would be to '' [ pre-negotiate ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-22961120 ) '' . 
  as such some questions are only going to be answerable within the period between a yes vote and secession from the union . 
  for example , trident . 
  the scottish government are committed to removing it but to do so obviously requires the participation of the uk government . 
  other than the very odd idea of [ unilaterally annexing faslane ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/1114283/scottish-trident-base-claims-preposterous ) , that process could not begin without both governments deciding how to do it . 
  similarly with the eu - the scottish government wish to remain in the eu , and the most sensible approach would be for secession from the uk to happen on the same date as joining the eu . 
  but there is no process for a country within an eu member state to become an eu member in its own right , so how exactly that would unfold is unclear ( other than there is nothing to gain for scotland , ruk , or the eu if part of the eu was to be temporarily ejected - so it 's reasonable to assume that a way would be found ) . 
  the referendum is also a referendum on if scotland should become independent , not what an independent scotland should look like . 
  decisions on currency , defence , etc , are all really matters for the post-independence government . 
  the referendum is in 2014 and the next election is 2016 , so while the current government can propose a policy on something like currency ( a '' [ sterling-zone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sterling_area ) '' arrangement with the uk , as used by ireland for 50 + years ) other parties are going to compete for your vote based on their plans . 
  imo , despite their claims that a sterling zone `` might not be allowed '' it 's unlikely that either scottish labour or the scottish conservatives would seriously propose adopting the euro or starting a brand new currency . 
   a lot of people will support scotland 's independence partly for spite . 
  you might be surprised . 
  people who really dislike david cameron ( leader of the uk government ) often really , really , really dislike alex salmond ( leader of the scottish government ) . 
  you 'll see this quite often online ; independence is often viewed as alex salmond 's personal crusade to ensure he becomes god-emperor for life ... ( see recent furore about the leader of the scottish government waving a scottish flag when a scot won wimbledon ) the most significant factor , imo , will be the wider uk economy . 
  the conservatives are proceeding with their austerity budget plans , most of which are yet to fully take effect . 
  more cuts are coming - by 2014 people may well say `` you know what , why not ? '', 
  in response . 
  there might be some , but probably more of businesses rather than individuals ( although individuals might follow their business ) . 
  the north of england has often felt economically neglected by uk governments - businesses there [ are aware ] ( http://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/story/2012-10-15/north-east-businesses-fear-scottish-independence/ ) that an independent neighbour on their doorstep would be working hard to attract investment . 
  the answer is no ; the uk has not set up an oil fund , as per norway , and so revenue extracted from the north sea has - to date - been spent . 
  the [ mccrone report ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mccrone_report ) was a document drawn up in 1974 , prior to the 1979 referendum , which pointed out that an independent scotland would benefit greatly from the remaining north sea oil . 
  this report was kept secret until 2005 , when the current scottish government managed to obtain it under a freedom of information request . 
  the remaining north sea revenue would obviously be more significant to a nation of 5 million than a nation of 60 million , however it is going to run out one day ( there 's no assumption that independence is only feasible with oil , although you do hear `` but what will you do when there 's no more oil ! '', 
  as an argument against independence ) . 
  currently the north sea generates about # 10bn a year - about the same as food/drink exports and tourism . 
  the drive is much more about a political separation from westminster than it is about `` identity '' or `` nationalism '' . 
  many scottish people feel `` scottish '' rather than `` british '' ( i was a little amused to see i have to select `` united kingdom '' as my nationality on the poll ) , however many english people also feel more english than british . 
  that has always been the case , but is not related to the current feeling that the uk political structure is too heavily weighted towards the south east of the country . 
  some people believe that one of the reasons behind scottish independence is a desire to participate more fully in the european union . 
  with parties like ukip standing on a manifesto of withdrawing from the eu , and the conservatives promising an in-or-out referendum in 2016 , arguably the best way for scotland to ensure it remained in the eu would be to vote yes in 2014 - rather than potentially be pulled out by the rest of the uk a few years later . 
  most independence movements are driven by differences in politics rather than `` blind nationalism '' . 
  writing a vanity letter saying he `` would like to offer any assistance my office can provide '' is a little different from actually approving the rbs buyout of amro . 
  that responsibility lies with the uk 's [ financial services authority ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/19/regulator-rbs-abn-amro-financial-services-authority ) , whose initial response was to publish a 298-word statement saying it had found no grounds to take action against any of rbs ' management and that their report into what happened would not be made public ( despite taking almost two years to write , to the cost of # 8m ) . 
  independent or not , personally i 'd be quite happy to see someone who presided over a clusterfuck of that magnitude going to jail . 
  scotland would need to rely on a bailout from someone like the imf ( or some inter-country arrangement , as the uk have with ireland ) whether they used sterling or the euro . 
  by no means an idea situation , but printing your own currency in this day and age is just asking for pressure from currency speculators . 
  ultimately once you reach the point of sovereign bankruptcy/bailout/inflation then none of your options are good - that there are three bad options rather than two seems a bit academic . 
  i 'm not sure there is `` a solution '' to the current crisis . 
  better financial regulation would help , probably , but historically that lasts for about 30 years before politicians relax it as an apparently easy way to improve the economy ( `` forget about that whole [ savings and loan crisis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savings_and_loan_crisis ) , that kind of thing could * never * happen again ... '' ) .
