  most countries seem to be trying to resolve it by accepting a decade or so of minimal growth with normal inflation , allowing the value of the debt to slowly evaporate without suddenly calling in debts and forcing them to be written off . 
   what makes the problems faced by scotland so different to those faced by different areas of england ? 
  the problems are probably quite similar , in that the uk generally suffers from the south east being the focus of political and economic activity ( which ends up being a vicious circle ) . 
  the context is quite different , in that having a different legal system and ( recently ) devolution means scotland already operates quite differently in several areas . 
  `` ethnic nationalism '' is often levelled as a criticism of the idea of scottish independence - that it 's driven by some kind of anti-english `` you 're not a * real * scot '' nonsense . 
  canard 's point is that the franchise is purely based on participation in life and culture within scotland , not on some ill-defined idea of being `` really '' scottish . 
  the referendum franchise has nothing to do with criteria for citizenship though . 
  my guess is that dual citizenship would be available to pretty much everyone in the uk - if you live in scotland you 'll get enrolled automatically , if you live elsewhere it 'll be rubber-stamped . 
  their policy on several subjects has changed since 2002 so they may also have changed their position since then . 
  at that point there was no referendum - i 've no doubt their proposals now will get more scrutiny than that document did , so if i was writing it i would also remove the old until the replacement had been finalised . 
  i do agree it 'd be useful to get some more information - but we 'll find out in a few months . 
  yes , there are no detailed plans available - as they say , they will publish that this autumn . 
  but mentioning the irish model by name makes it pretty obvious that it 'll be a fairly loose qualification . 
  i think it 's a bit of a stretch to call that `` hiding it '' or `` refusing to detail '' . 
  it would be good if some ( any ) of the other parties would announce their position - unfortunately labour/conservatives are assuming that the referendum will not pass , and therefore there 's no need to explain what they will do if it does . 
  it 's clearly a mystery . 
  if only they [ had a faq ] ( http://www.snp.org/referendum/faqs/c# ) :  q. 
  citizenship - who will be eligible for scottish citizenship ? 
    we anticipate a broad definition of citizenship including qualification through both residency and birth , and provision for dual citizenship too . 
  detailed plans regarding qualification for citizenship in an independent scotland will be published later this year . 
  after independence , it will be for elected scottish governments to consider any further changes . 
  there 's also some [ comments here ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/salmond-snp-favours-irish-style-citizenship-after-independence.1358446515 ) , indicating the snp favour `` the maximum entitlement to citizenship , similar to the citizenship model in ireland '' ( anyone with an irish grandparent is entitled to citizenship ) . 
  printing extra currency is not a magic wand - it `` pays off '' debt by decreasing the value of everyone else 's money . 
  it 's debatable if the euro is really the reason for the current banking crisis or not . 
  sharing a common interest rate is obviously more painful for some countries than others , particularly if both rich and poor are less than candid about their finances . 
  but the current problems are much more about a financial system operating without oversight - a global ponzi scheme where unpayable debt is sold and resold is a much bigger problem than what currency was used for the transactions . 
  although some matters are reserved , westminster has the ultimate sovereignty in uk politics . 
  if the uk government decides to participate in the next iraq then the scottish government has no power of veto . 
  similarly , the scottish government does not have the power to vary the rate of tax on alcohol . 
  this means that minimum pricing has to be implemented using a `` minimum price per unit '' , rather than increasing the rate of tax . 
  this does mean that alcohol prices rise , and so consumption will fall , however that extra money goes to retailers rather than the government . 
  we currently spend around [ # 3.6 bn per year ] ( http://news.stv.tv/west-central/189700-alcohol-abuse-costs-each-glaswegian-more-than-1000-a-year/ ) dealing with this problem , so increasing the tax threshold would go a long way to ensuring that those causing the problem also helped pay for some of the cleanup . 
  the difference is because there is currently no such thing as a `` scottish citizen '' ; if there was , i think everyone would agree that would be a sensible criteria to use . 
  those most invested in the referendum are , imo , those living in scotland . 
  it 's unfortunate for those people who moved away temporarily and fully intend to return - although most of those would probably still remain registered to vote in scotland ( there 's been plenty of advance notice ) . 
  however , if you 've made london your home for the last 40 years then living in glasgow until you were 2 is neither here nor there . 
  as there is no `` scottish citizenship '' , trying to draw up a franchise based on connection-to-scotland would be next to impossible . 
  the franchise is , like parliamentary elections , based on residency - essentially any uk , eu , or commonwealth citizen who lives in scotland is eligible . 
  that does mean that people born in scotland who now live elsewhere in the uk do n't have a vote ( about 800k ) , but on the other hand people born elsewhere who now live in scotland do ( about 400k ) . 
  there is no parallel between the suffering that happened in ireland and the current political situation in scotland . 
  however the arguments that were made against irish independence are quite similar - gladstone touches on them in his home rule speech :  the arguments used on the other side of the house appear to me to rest in principle and in the main upon one of two suppositions . 
  one of them , which i will not now discuss , is the profound incompetency of the irish people ; but there is another , and it is this . 
  it is , i believe , the conscientious conviction of honourable gentlemen opposite that when two or more countries , associated but not incorporated together , are in disturbed relations with each other , the remedy is to create an absolute legislative incorporation . 
  on the other hand , they believe that the dissolution of such an incorporation is clearly the mode to bring about the dissolution of the political relations of those countries . 
  there are obviously cultural differences between now and then of course - loyalty to the king was considered important , there was an empire , etc. 
  but by and large people arguing against independence use very similar arguments no matter where , or when , the debate is happening . 
  it 's going to be a [ horrible dystopian future ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n9xvfltghji/ur7zrbb_32i/aaaaaaaaans/qlynw5zzzu0/s1600/donegallplacebelfasthomerule.jpg ) and mobiles will get [ more expensive ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-23112568 ) . 
  another way of looking at it is the change in the dont-know vote ; the yes vote has been hovering about 30 % for a year , the no vote has gone from a high of 59 % down to 44 % . 
  the referendum itself is still a year away , and a 4 % shift from no to yes would bring them equal . 
  the no campaign has been pretty unrelentingly negative - my feeling is the long lead-up to the actual vote was deliberate , as people do get tired of being continually told that they 're [ too wee/too poor/too stupid ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/too_small,_too_poor,_too_stupid ) to take charge of their own affairs . 
  in all likelihood both scotland and ruk would benefit from it . 
  many of the same arguments against it were made about ireland , however few people would argue that ireland should be part of the uk again . 
   because it will replace one class of oppressors by another . 
  the situation with scottish independence is much more about a difference in political direction than a feeling of `` oppression '' . 
  e.g. , scotland is setting itself much more aggressive goals for energy ( 100 % from renewables by 2020 , vs the uk target of 15 % ) . 
  you can see similar differences over things like minimum alcohol pricing ( alcohol abuse is a significant public health problem in scotland ) or plain-packaging for cigarettes ( now dropped by the uk , so will be scotland only ) . 
  in some respects , yes - although there also some examples where [ that does n't happen ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/michael-moore-savaged-by-unionist-peers-over-eu-row.1355860198 ) ( tldr ; the european commission have offered to discuss how an independent scotland would apply for membership while part of the uk , the uk government is refusing to do so because that would be `` pre-negotiating '' ) .

  the definition is essentially set by the [ age of legal capacity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_legal_capacity_\\ ( scotland \\ ) _ act_1991 ) . 
  this is currently 16 in scotland , and 18 in the other countries in the uk . 
  the age is arbitrary of course - the question is really at what age are they considered to be legal adults ? 
  in scotland that age is 16 . 
  perhaps the age of adulthood should rise , but where to set that limit is often as cultural as anything else ( e.g. , we chose 18 for the drinking age in the uk , the usa chose 21 ) . 
   i know in the last few years my political leanings have massively changed , i would have considered myself very conservative in my teens , but now left leaning . 
  the problem with that argument is that most people find that process repeats as they go through life - you may well find yourself becoming more conservative again as you get older . 
  i assume you would n't think it sensible that 25-year old you should lose the vote because 50-year old you thinks you 're not `` voting accurately '' ? 
  there are two entirely separate legal systems within the uk ( three if you count ni ) , so there is a great deal more variation than you might expect . 
  you can stretch the metaphor too far to say that the uk is like the eu and its constituent countries , but it 's closer to that than the idea that scotland or england are simply regions within a single country . 
  you frequently argue that ukip representatives with [ extreme views ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ugly-face-ukip-sunday-mirror-1531879 ) should be held to account as individuals , rather than their views being interpreted as implicitly `` ukip '' . 
  if someone wrote that ukip members were `` basically racists who want out of the eu '' you would , quite rightly , point out that while individuals in ukip might be racist the two issues are separate . 
  maybe the west coast of america ? 
  e.g. , orange walks are almost exclusively a west coast thing - around glasgow and ayrshire . 
  part of it is probably tied up in the football , and sectarianism is also something that 's more of a glasgow issue than anywhere else . 
  if anything it is normally considered to be the other way round - the west coast has much stronger ties to unionism , via ni . 
   do n't have the hook-ups that their parents do with regards to disliking the english please stop claiming that wanting independence has anything to do with `` disliking the english '' . 
  independence is entirely about political autonomy , not some mel gibson-level anti-english sentiments . 
  yes , you will find some people pro-independence who are also anti-english . 
  you will find daft people everywhere , including ukip . 
  it will enfranchise an extra 100,000 people , or about 2.5 % of the electorate . 
  i suspect their thinking ( you may be surprised to know , but the scottish government is not just god emperor alex salmond ) is that 2.5 % is unlikely to be the deciding factor and therefore they should take the opportunity to put their principles into practice . 
  the age of legal majority ( adulthood ) is 16 in scotland ; they can get married , enter full time work , pay taxes , buy alcohol ( with some restrictions : it must be with food , but unlike england/wales there does not need to be an adult present ) , etc. 
  they can take on many of the responsibilities of adulthood at that age in scotland , so the argument is that they should also take on many of the same rights .
