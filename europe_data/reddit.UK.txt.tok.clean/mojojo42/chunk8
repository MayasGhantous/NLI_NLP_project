  many private landlords would be reluctant to rent to a 16 year old , however they are legally allowed to sign a lease ( typically they would rent from the local council ) . 
  different countries are different - it 's crazy !, 
  i do n't think sweeping statements like `` scots seem to think '' are very useful . 
  i am scottish , i do n't think it 's a good idea to be rude to someone simply for being english ( or anything ) , but when living in london i regularly heard jokes about how we 're all alcoholic penny-pinching subsidy junkies who love a good deep-friend mars bar . 
  you ca n't say anything about millions of people based on a few idiots . 
   xenophobia towards scots in england simply does not exist . 
  however , the same can not be said of scots attitude towards english people . 
  that seems a little unlikely . 
  you can find idiots everywhere . 
  most people posting on / r/scotland are pro-independence - i doubt many would describe themselves as socialists . 
  while a braying mob is not an acceptable way to behave , it 's simplistic to say that opinions on ukip are based only on their immigration policy . 
  unfortunately ukip have now taken their scottish manifesto offline , but it also included plans to abolish the scottish parliament and revert the smoking ban . 
  neither of those are likely to garner them much support in scotland . 
  in the short term continuing to use sterling - our own currency would leave us vulnerable to currency speculators . 
  in the longer term the euro , but possible only if the uk also switched . 
  much more eloquently put - take my upvotes .

  the credit says the figures come from [ migrationwatch ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/migrationwatch_uk ) , who regularly provide similar numbers to right-wing newspapers in the uk . 
  you seem to have leapt from a complaint about `` scotland and england are the same thing '' to `` the scottish anti-english attitude '' . 
  seeing scotland as different from england in no way requires a dislike of england or its people . 
  one of the main differences between her and other politicians was that she was very ideological - she had an agenda , and she was willing to push that through without much ( apparent ) care for the side effects . 
  some examples : * there was [ large-scale unemployment ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/26/newsid_2506000/2506335.stm ) . 
  13 % on average , although in some areas it was much higher ( 20 % in northern ireland and 15 % through most of scotland and the north of england ) . 
  * scotland was treated '' [ as a laboratory for experimentation ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/sep/16/conservatives.politics ) '' for a deeply unpopular new form of tax ( it was applied in scotland a year before the other three countries in the uk ) . 
  * [ section 28 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/section_28 ) was ( essentially ) based on the idea that being gay was immoral . 
  there were similarly policies that could be considered `` racist '' , such as widely expanded use of [ stop-and-search ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sus_law ) powers for the police in london . 
  with a great many of these there was , strictly speaking , no explicit bias . 
  however in practice they were seen as reinforcing fairly standard right-wing agendas , and politicians of the time encouraged this in their speeches ( e.g. , thatcher 's criticism of '' [ anti-racist mathematics ] ( http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/106941 ) '' , which was not previously known as a widespread problem in uk schools ) . 
  * an explicit policy of privatisation of public services , largely based on ideas from milton friedman . 
  these were very new ideas in the uk at the time - previously the cultural feeling was typically `` public service x might be rubbish , but it 's our rubbish '' ( the newly privatised servies often required state subsidies , made those in charge extremely wealthy , and have a mixed record of actually providing a better service ) . 
  * vociferously opposed to german unification . 
  despite proclaiming the right of self-determination , particularly for the citizens of the ussr , it had its limits . 
  * introduced legislation to reduce the influence of trade unions . 
  not in itself a problem , however the timing ( 1980 , 1982 , 1984 , 1988 , 1989 , 1990 ) makes it clear it was very much an arms race approach to reducing influence - every few years , what was legal became illegal . 
  some of these sound quite sensible ( requiring secret ballots to prevent peer pressure ) , some seem quite obvious spoiler tactics ( allowing individual citizens to sue against ` unlawful ' industrial action that deprives them of goods and services - making a strike much riskier to participate in ) . 
  aside from the issues with the unions , the other attribute people associate with her time in power is the growth of inequality . 
  london certainly prospered , other areas of the country felt like they had been dismantled . 
  some people did very , very , well . 
  some people were ruined . 
  you should post something positive then . 
  solaris is excellent . 
  i think the english version originally got a bad reputation because it was a translation of the french translation ( so polish -  french -  english ) , but there was a revised english translation a couple of years ago that i really enjoyed . 
  `` the wasp factory '' by ian banks . 
  edit : if you have not read it , do not read the plot synopsis on wikipedia first . 
  it is quite shocking at times - knowing the plot in advance will make it much less powerful . 
  they mean `` occupation '' in the sense of `` profession '' or `` trade '' , not iraq . 
  it is a bit redundant ( given that the column header is `` meaning '' !, 
  ) , but presumably the editor was trying to say `` bakers were often called becker '' to avoid people thinking `` ah , so becker is the german word for baker '' . 
  most likely [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_most_common_surnames_in_europe ) ( this also has the top ten or so per country - interesting to see the runners up ) . 
  is [ that ] ( http://fxcuisine.com/default.asp?language=2&amp;display=103&amp;resolution=high ) really so disgusting ? 
  i was torn between a munchy box and deep fried pizza ... but i figured some mad italian must have invented the pizza already . 
  but reusing an old pizza box ? 
  for a random selection of mystery meat ? 
  and chips ? 
  now that 's genius ... 
  best : [ cullen skink ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cullen_skink ) ( smoked haddock soup ) worst : [ munchy box ] ( http://23x.net/5/what-is-a-munchy-box.html ) ( do n't ask ), 
  glasgow salad is not actually a salad . 
  independence is the norm , not the exception . 
  the 9.9 % levy applies to savings of over $ 100k - everyone else , from $ 1 upwards , is going to have 6.75 % taken from them . 
  it derives from [ saxon ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sasana ) . 
  the equivalent in scotland is sassenach . 
  it might be popular with people who like that kind of music , but it 's not one most people have heard of . 
   but how many scots are employed in the public sector ? 
  if it is far more than the uk average then you 've a problem as that is n't wealth creating income . 
  public sector employment is [ 23 % ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/statistics/browse/labour-market/trendpublicsectoremp ) in scotland . 
  of that , 20 % relates to devolved public sector work and 3 % is for reserved public sector work . 
  public sector employment is [ 20 % ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pse/public-sector-employment/q3-2012/index.html ) in the uk as a whole . 
  because scottish independence is about political autonomy , not some gin-soaked australian racist ? 
  the `` freeeddooooommm !!! '', 
  meme is regularly trotted out within the uk as an argument against independence , so it gets a little tiresome . 
  other favourites include that we would be required to adopt the euro , enter schengen , might have our airports bombed by the uk , would go bankrupt once the north sea oil runs out , are only doing this to ensure alex salmond becomes some kind of god emperor of the north , would n't be able to join nato , can only exist due to subsidies from england , etc , etc. 
   once the vote comes through , the uk government is obliged to provide resources to support the process . 
  the uk government is already obliged to represent scotland on all interests that were reserved after devolution . 
  that includes the portion of scotland that will vote no of course , but the last two scottish governments have been the party that has called the referendum - simply saying `` no , we refuse to discuss the situation with the european commission '' does not appear to be equitably representing scotland . 
  the majority of the treasury revenue in the uk is raised within england ; as england contains about 85 % of the uk 's population , that seems reasonable . 
  however the majority of treasury expenditure on scotland is raised within scotland ; that point is frequently misunderstood ( that a future scottish government would run a deficit is unknown , but probably true - most countries do , at least at some point ) . 
   an overwhelming majority of this tax is raised in england actually about [ 83 % ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/publications/2012/03/9525 ) of money spent in scotland was generated in scotland . 
  those issues have nothing to with galileo ( or the gps system ) - they are all due to the way in which device manufacturers have chosen to expose the information they derive from the gps system . 
  the use of `` gps '' in those articles is a short-hand for `` gps client devices , and really the use of nmea by those devices '' , not the technology behind the gps system ( or galileo ) itself . 
  being out of work can be devastating to anyone - rural or urban ( there are more jobs available in the city , but there are also more people competing for them ) . 
  i do n't think the fishing industry should be ignored , but i think it needs to be placed in context . 
  historically it was much more significant than it is today - that does n't justify trying to extinguish it , but it is one industry among many . 
  i 'm really not sure what your `` bigger picture '' sentence is trying to say . 
  i will point out that adopting a share of the uk 's debts also implies adopting a similar share of the uk 's assets . 
  that we might have to cut our cloth to fit is true , but i think you 're being unnecessarily pessimistic . 
  the economic issues do definitely need to be explored more thoroughly , and i think we will see that this year . 
  but i think the bottom line is that scotland has a pretty typical western europe population , and there are smaller and poorer countries than scotland existing quite happily within the eu . 
  david cameron has promised [ additional devolved powers ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-offers-further-devolution-as-he-rallies-scots-to-defend-union-6989033.html ) , although has refused to comment on what those might be . 
  the `` same time '' is simply my opinion ; much as the initial eurozone countries switched overnight , the amount of cross-border traffic/people/business there is between scotland and england means that i think neither country would want to go without the other switching too . 
  certainly , if the uk went then i can see scotland decided to go in sync - and i ca n't see scotland deciding to change without the uk . 
  i think people generally are much more gunshy of the euro given the crisis ; 10 years of independence and a stable euro then perhaps someone will campaign on switching even if the uk does n't . 
  my guess is the uk itself will decide to join within the next 25-50 years . 
   eu has said that scotland would have to re-apply for membership . 
  the european commission have not made any statement one way or the other ; they have said they will offer an opinion if the uk government asks , but the uk government is [ refusing to do so ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/18/scottish-independence-mic_n_2324048.html ) . 
  in terms of fishing , it 's worth remembering that fishing only employs about 5,000 people - whisky is more like 40,000 . 
  fishing is culturally and historically significant , but it is about 1 % of scotland 's effective gdp .
