  once upon a time , the people of mercia got all riled up about all these people from essex migrating . 
  as far as i see it , this is no different . 
  only on a larger scale . 
  it 's a shift from the norm that is making people uncomfortable , and the eu is still taking its baby steps . 
  the greek economy , the refugee crisis , poverty in the former soviet bloc , catalonian and scottish cries for independence are all teething pains . 
  fucking massive teething pains , but somebody always prospers after chaos . 
  with clever economic management and some good friends who speak another tongue , we can make sure those people are us . 
  i consider myself european first , and british second . 
  if we left the eu , i would say goodbye to grandfather britain . 
  there 's [ lacock ] ( http://wiltshireweb.co.uk/wp-content/gallery/lacock-filming-of-cranford-christmas-special/lacock_20.jpg ) , which is teeming with tourists . 
  i worked there one summer , in a touristy naff shop . 
  made # 1,000 one day ( i did n't , the shop did ) from peddling the useless shit that american tourists seem to love , dog bandanas and a suitcase from the 1950s with * ye olde mappe of ye countie of wyltshire * printed on the side of it , and the like . 
  it 's home to [ lacock abbey ] ( https://stephenliddell.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/lacock_abbey_cloisters.jpg ) , which you might recognise from somewhere . 
  also home to camilla the gorilla , so do n't walk around after dark or she 'll get you . 
  there are thousands of them here . 
  poles , russians , lithuanians , romanians , even a few hungarians . 
  soon there will be syrians . 
  they keep their streets clean , they respect the law , they work hard and harder than we expect in this country , they learn the language and engage the community . 
  polite , cordial , tidy , they 're more british than some britons . 
  my bus driver is polish , my banker is russian , the man who serves me at the bakery is lithuanian , and the publican is german , and the kid at burger king is spanish . 
  i go to college with a greek kid and a bulgarian lass ( neither of whom speak their language though , which is unfortunate ) . 
  i do n't even notice when i 've slipped into another language now , short , blunt phrases mostly ( `` ein guinness , bitte '' , `` statsia , prosha '' ) , that probably are being received as curt and rude , but it 's the best i can do and i do n't realise when i do it . 
  ordering and conversing in a foreign language is the new normal for britain . 
  the time we accidentally invaded spain springs to mind . 
  do you actually buy bicycles , or do you just `` find '' them ? 
  probably the latter . 
  he 's a bit of a smug prick . 
  butts into a lot of private conversations with , `` well , actually ... '', 
  i thought your capital was the hague ? 
  i got a bollocking from a dutchman because i thought amsterdam was the capital . 
  chavs , neds , knackers , and gypsies . 
  it 's romani , meaning something like `` unpleasant boy '' . 
  they 're not really nobility now . 
  being a member of the house of lords is no longer hereditary , these are the last batch who were born with the job . 
  they can only be appointed now . 
  i 've got no idea if this is actually true , because my brother used to try this all the time and they would always say no . 
  either that is n't true , or the venue 's policy can supersede the law . 
  `` free '' means unrestricted , not free of charge . 
  for some reason , a lot of people make that mistake . 
  you know you have too many minority parties when 37 % of votes is a majority vote . 
  i think nick clegg has been vindicated though , all those years of people wondering `` what the fuck does nick clegg do ? '' . 
  well i think it is abundantly clear what he was stopping . 
  there 's not really enough room in the uk for open hunting . 
  if you ever get lost , you can just walk in a straight line from any point and you will eventually find a settlement . 
  within a day is what i was told , and that was in the brecon beacons ( you ca n't really get much more remote than that ) . 
  ` course the advice when you are lost is to stay still , but that 's assuming that people are looking for you . 
  we make a habit about caring about appearance and the environment . 
  disposable plastic cups screams `` cheap as fuck '' and `` next stop : landfill '' to our guests . 
  our friends tend to lend a hand when washing up too . 
  it 's a little weird there , as far as i understand it , dentistry was once fully covered by the nhs . 
  currently the only people who can take advantage of dentistry on the nhs are children , pensioners , and people in full time education , and people who have genuine need for treatment . 
  i was getting my dentistry done by the private practice dentist that i went to as a child , but they were shite . 
  kept forgetting that lidocaine gave me seizures and charging me because my hc1 was n't filled out right and whatnot , so now i see an nhs orthodontist who sorts out my braces and gives me a complimentary gum gouging , teeth scraping , and everything else that dentists like to do to their ~ ~ victims ~ ~ patients . 
  other than my lazy gp , the nhs is grand . 
  i 've had more trouble with private dentists than the nhs . 
  we have aethelstan who was the first king of a united england , alfred the great , the moonrakers , and chippenham has this chap called tony the running man who runs * everywhere * picking up litter . 
  he was n't chosen to carry the olympic torch and the entire town was outraged . 
  well we 're celebrating that we stopped him . 
  it 'd be like burning effigies of hitler on april the 30 ^ th every year . 
  i make a bastard language using what i know : a tiny bit of french and spanish , some german , and a tad of russian , whilst attempting to pronounce english words that i can not translate in their accent . 
  it 's slow , but i have n't been in a situation yet where we absolutely can not understand each other . 
  whoo , i am * not * ready for my exam on this haha . 
  thanks for pointing all this out , i * really * need to step up my revision . 
  i have corrected my introduction , and included a speculation disclaimer . 
  we have two types of court , magistrate courts and crown courts . 
  magistrate courts practice criminal and civil law , and crown courts practice criminal law . 
  the longest sentence that a magistrate court can order is six months imprisonment , whereas a crown court can order a sentence without trial , but that is very rare . 
  99 % of all criminal cases start in smaller courts where they evaluate the quality and reliability of the evidence . 
  as lgf92 pointed out we have many types of court , including appellate courts , the high court , the supreme court ( formerly the house of lords court ) , the administrative courts , and many others . 
  rape is a sexual offence . 
  ** all ** allegations of sexual offences must be investigated by the crown prosecution service . 
  alleged criminal offenders can not be released until their court date unless there is a severe lack of evidence . 
  like , none at all . 
  the evidence against this guy ** is ** admissible ; it was legally obtained . 
  for somebody who has been accused of murder or a sexual assault to be released on bail , the evidence against them must be inadmissible . 
  bail works very differently here . 
  you do n't just throw a wad of cash at the police and promise to turn up for your court date . 
  the purpose of the court system is n't to decisively prove if somebody is guilty or innocent , all that needs to be proven is that the defendant is guilty or innocent ** beyond reasonable doubt ** . 
  judges do n't have such authoritarian powers here in the uk , it 's all done by a jury ( personally i 'd rather be tried by a professional who has practiced law for many years than a bunch of mugs off the streets if i 'm ever accused of something but that 's just me ) . 
  the next section is speculation from myself . 
  most of that article is mere sensationalism ; that sort of behaviour from the authorities is completely normal . 
  they are absolutely thorough . 
  the 90 minute court session this bloke sat through is just a formality , where all admissible evidence is presented and the suspect quite often does n't need to be there ( as a matter of practicality , legally they do have to be there ) . 
  the jury would n't of had the video put on for them . 
  it would have been played frame by frame from multiple cameras , with annotations , testimony transcripts from all parties ( including however many witnesses the police could find , which on the tube could be hundreds ) , there would be forensic evidence from the suspect 's fingers , the alleged victim 's underwear and you-know-whats . 
  i would wager that took up 85 minutes of that jury deliberation , and the last five minutes were the jury saying `` so this guy 's innocent , right ? '', 
  the war wo n't end with al-assad . 
  like it or not , we need him at the moment to hold some semblance of power until we can quash daesh , and then we can sort him out . 
  he 's the devil we know , and if we depose him then that will cause a power vacuum . 
  who knows who will rise to power in his stead ? 
  maybe somebody who wants co-operation with the west , maybe somebody with an isolationist policy in mind , maybe another war-waging fool , or maybe a madman with dreams of conquest . 
  syria is n't afghanistan round 2 , or a repeat of the gulf war . 
  this is the big one . 
  whilst we were distracted by the taliban and al-qaeda , daesh was consolidating its power in syria and iraq , assisted by the power vacuum we caused by deposing hussein . 
  daesh are n't illiterate goatherders with aks , they are a highly weaponised professional military force . 
  this is n't going to be counter insurgency , this is going to be conventional warfare right on europe 's doorstep , and if iran , saudi arabia , and turkey think they can play this game then it 's going to blow up in their face . 
  this is a job that requires solidarity and co-operation , and we will need america 's aircraft and navy , russia 's tanks and artillery , and britain 's boots on the ground . 
  we need to settle our differences - fuck knows we have differences - and work together , because we are facing a type of enemy that has n't been seen for seventy years , and they are preparing for a crusade . 
  they are in our countries , in our towns and cities , and are waiting for an opportunity . 
  we must not give them that opportunity , and cut them out before they cause further infection .
