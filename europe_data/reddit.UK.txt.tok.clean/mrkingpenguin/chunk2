  luckiily for cameron merkel and hollande knows he will be there for another 5 years , whereas hollande and ( possibly ) merkel could be gone fairly soon . 
  suck it france and germany, 
  c'mon aus man i was counting on you, 
  if we are above you i am sorry ... 
  nice to see juncker intervening for the right reasons ... i 'm almost beginning to warm to him . 
   apparently believing there 's a european commissioner `` for regulation '' it may not be clear if you are a non-native english speaker , but i think ganesh ( the author ) here is being ironic . 
  when read in context , * politicians who can not name the european commissioner for regulation , whose every diktat impinges on our prospects * it appears that he is mocking those in britian who see eu as one amorphous regulation-imposer . 
  i think you are being unreasonable . 
  i added the bit after the colon on because i felt this thread would be deleted / ignored as the article title itself does n't reference europe . 
  the added bit is pretty much a summary of the conclusions the article makes and related it specifically to europe , so i felt it was n't to outrageous to do so . 
  hope you understand . 
  if you are paywalled , i have pasted an extract . 
  * british conservatives will cite this fixation with america as proof that cultural affinity within the anglosphere transcends anything as ephemeral as the eu . 
  but if that were true , it would be reciprocated . 
  us congressional aides would convene at water coolers to discuss the latest westminster caper . 
  they do not , and neither do politicos in australia or canada . 
  * * they will know that our prime minister is david cameron . 
  they might know that mr miliband wants his job . 
  they have probably heard of boris johnson , the guy with the funny hair who runs london . 
  at that point , the knowledge and interest thins . 
  they do not pretend that another country 's politics can serve as the background hum of their own . 
  * * even if there are deep and ancestral reasons why people in british public life feel gripped by the us , and not europe , they do not accord with any reading of the national interest . 
  america is the most powerful country in the world but its day-by-day influence over britain is nothing like as great as the eu 's , as eurosceptics themselves would agree . 
  * * a grown-up political class would give up trying to live vicariously through washington , and try to get their heads around brussels , berlin and paris . 
  the european parliament and its workings , the relative presence of different nationalities in official roles , the undulating balance of power between various capitals on the continent : all of this is dull , all of it is vital . 
  a serious british politician or pundit , even ( or especially ) if he or she is eurosceptic , should be conversant with these subjects . 
  they are matters of national destiny . 
  would you be prepared to move to get higher pay ? 
  stupid question : you mean road signs , right ? 
  i am so terribly sad to hear this ... 
   he is n't liked by people at large is n't liked by ` people ' at large , or not like by the vocal majority on twitter and in the media , at large ? 
  you have a $ 1 trillion wealth fund ... i think you will be alright for now ... 
  it is like being supported by satan . 
  perhaps ignoring the fact that he is the reason for you having a welsh assembly . 
  typical of the anti-blair brigade to only appear to remember iraq and nothing else . 
   universally bad not true . 
  he is disliked a lot by the anti-war left for iraq and the far right for his immigration policies . 
  however he stepped down as pm with majority positive views of him , and his public sector reform is still widely respected among most people . 
  the vocal minority of the hate he gets over iraq often drowns out quieter support . 
  well i grew up during his premiership and i can tell you that helped me quite a damn lot . 
  not sure which ` history ' you 're referencing here , or if you have ever lived in the uk . 
  i personally do care what someone who governed our country for 10 years has to say about affairs which he knows lots about ( eu ) ... but hey thats just me . 
  not sure if you are up to speed with british politics , but it is extremely relevant as it there is a general election in 4 weeks , and the eu is one of the main points in the campaign , and if the conservatives get in then it may mean some significant change in europe down the line for ** all members ** . 
  terrible comparison to try and justify a pariah state, 
   tally-ho and earl grey . 
  banter . 
  henning wehn -- germany 's most valuable export since 2010, 
  mostly stemming from the ` calvinist ' ideal of a productive life being a good life . 
  as a brit , do you mind explaining how you reach that decision -- always nice to hear an opinion of your country from the outside , 
  ** for non-econ subscribers , i paste in the last few paragraphs of the article : ** * there is more tension over the status of ukraine 's 156,000 ethnic hungarians , but it mainly emanates from outside of ukraine . 
  viktor orban , the hungarian prime minister and one of vladimir putin 's better friends in europe , has repeatedly called for autonomy for hungarian-ukrainians . 
  mr orban has found something of an ally in laszlo brenzovics , head of the hungarian cultural association of transcarpathia ( kmksz ) and a member of ukraine 's parliament , where he represents the party of president petro poroshenko . 
  but mr brenzovics has never gone as far as jobbik , hungary 's far-right party , which calls ukraine 's crisis an opportunity to `` finally resolve the situation of transcarpathian hungarians '' . 
  * * the epicentre of hungarian culture in ukraine is berehove , a city of 24,000 near the border that was only incorporated into ukraine in 1945 . 
  hundreds of red , white and green flags flutter on monuments . 
  street signs are bilingual , and hungarian can be used for some administrative purposes ( a benefit of ukraine 's 2012 law on regional languages ) . 
  many locals have taken advantage of a simplified naturalisation procedure to gain hungarian citizenship , which mr orban and his fidesz party introduced in 2010 . 
  * * from its headquarters in nearby uzhhorod , the kmksz has hinted at sympathy towards pro-russian separatists in ukraine 's east . 
  it urges a peaceful solution to the conflict and calls for greater minority rights and the creation of administrative units along ethnic lines . 
  mr brenzovics has also taken up the popular cause of opposition to military mobilisation ; ukraine should not send `` a country lad or father from the village '' to a war zone , he says . 
  this is still a far cry from jobbik , which denounces `` kiev 's puppet government '' and claims it `` serves the interests of atlantic powers '' . 
  * * of course , many ukrainians are resentful of the draft , not to mention the country 's entrenched corruption and deteriorating economy . 
  what sets hungarian-ukrainians apart is the ability to express their discontent in ethnic terms , and the presence of a neighbouring government interested in exploiting it . 
  on the hungarian side , the transcarpathian cause presents a chance for the ultranationalists of jobbik to take a jab at fidesz . 
  mr orban will continue to play this political game , but he has no interest in provoking violence . 
  as for the ruthenes , they have no outside sponsor trying to foment separatism . 
  * * the political theorist benedict anderson famously referred to nation-states as `` imagined communities '' . 
  but some such communities are more imagined than others . 
  if the russian press wants to find significant ethnic separatist movements in transcarpathian ukraine , it will have to keep inventing them . 
  of course , i was n't meaning to demean the us in any way with that comment , i was more referring to the socioeconomic differences . 
  it goes without saying that the usa is of course a country in itself and the eu is most certainly not . 
  i apologise if i was vague . 
  before you make assumptions based on my flair , i have worked as an intern for an mep and have participated , a few years back , in the eyp . 
  i am aware of the problems with procedure and spending at the parliament . 
  you can still be pro-eu and against the inefficiency of the parliament itself . 
  perhaps it would be easier if you could respond to my claims with a counter argument , rather than attacking me personally . 
  i agree with your point , but why does silicon valley attract angel investors ? 
  because that 's where the good start ups are going to be . 
  it 's a virtuous circle . 
  unfortunately , you ca n't just spend some funds and expect a facebook to ` appear ' , whilst hitting actual facebook with anti-competition law suits . 
  you need to develop a proper environment in which entrepreneurship can flourish and people want to create . 
  one of the few advantages us has over eu is that it is ** much ** more friendly and easy for people to start their own companies . 
  this is why you are getting so many brits and germans moving to silicon valley , because europe , with its big part-government owned companies , is more hostile to new disruptive innovation . 
  want an example ? 
  ** uber **, 
  someone questions the excessive waste and bureaucracy of the euro parliament ... 
  in other news , the sky is still blue . 
  why britain is apparently twice as anti-eu as russia lol, 
  i 'm pretty sure the uk is more closely aligned with india ( commonwealth etc. ), 
  than pakistan , who seems to be at odds with the entire western sphere since bin laden . 
  but i may be wrong . 
  apologies , it was a mistype , i meant 500m . 
  and , if you actually took the time to read my comment fully , i am not eurosceptic , just against certain elements of the eu legislative process . 
  but hey , it 's much easier to point out a typing mistake than actually engaging with my argument . 
   i really hope the uk government follows suit , it did . 
  cameron led a massive trade mission there a year or so ago . 
  whilst it would be truly dumb if the uk did leave , hopefully a future referendum would serve to remind the eu that it is responsible for 700m people , and it has to be responsible to them and their individual governments , and that they need to work harder to increase efficiency and eliminate the growing bureaucracy in strasbourg and brussels . 
  you have to be pretty desperate to do take a job like this ... also , let me give some advice to vlad putin : if you want some good pr and other countries to view russia positively , it would much easier to ** not ** randomly invade other countries -- much cheaper than running this orwellian internet police . 
  just saying .
