  this is not the way i believe the uk should be run . 
  you are happy with us having a 12 % or so of the voting power and having swayed 0 % of the votes we were against to in recent years . 
  because `` usually they are ok . '' or `` maybe they help someone else . '', 
  the whole idea is preposterous . 
  as a union of nations the limits should be clearly drawn beforehand instead of allowing competence creep without any limits . 
  this is just a description of the general way the eu works , and i do n't agree to that at all . 
  for me it was perfectly fine when it just took care of trade conflict and resolution . 
  long , long ago . 
  that was very good and very few people would be against that . 
  also , when free movement of labour happened within countries that had more or less balanced economies . 
  but these point , to me personally , are secondary in comparison with the lack of democracy and representativity . 
  i 'm a scientist . 
  that definition of `` proving '' is a bit weak and unconvincing to me . 
  that 's simply a conjecture over a future scenario nobody really can know . 
  i 'm very convinced that i do n't want to be part of the eu and the direction it has taken , yes . 
  we had to accept these laws , as part of the deal . 
  many of us do n't like this , which is why we 're voting out - others may have other reasons . 
  am i clear now ? 
  more than half of the legislation affecting the uk comes from brussels . 
  you may not understand this because your country has always been a backwater , but in the uk we give a lot of importance to representation , to the social contract and to democracy . 
  it 's a lost cause in the eu . 
  for reference and to understand the historical background of the peoples of britain i recommend you most importantly hobbes and [ locke ] ( http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-political/ ) . 
  others are making the economic argument , i 'm not . 
  for me it 's not about the economy . 
  i 've repeated that several times in the conversation . 
  i want that the elected representatives of the uk make the bulk of the decisions in uk sovereign land . 
  they are over the place in this context because they mix up the immigration we can not control even with our borders back - british citizens and direct family - with that of the immigration we would be able to control in the event of brexit . 
  turns out these numbers are quite significant . 
  concrete facts are guesses in such a scenario . 
  nobody can prove things would go better or worse ceteris paribus because of brexit , 10 years from now . 
   the problem with the in-vote campaign is that the out-vote campaign is much more mobilized . 
  the problem with the remainers is that they are basing their campaign on fear exclusively . 
  brexiters want something . 
  we want our sovereignty back . 
  no , you 're just wrong if you think it 's all about money . 
  not for me . 
  why the obsession with money ? 
  are you that poor ? 
  i do n't have a horse in this race , mate . 
  we 're not even in schengen and i doubt we are in the eu for much longer . 
  `` you are lumping together the commonwealth era '' ( with current migration ) . 
  these numbers are all over the place , talking about non-uk born and mixing it up with actual migrants . 
  british citizens are not considered migrants for border control purposes which is what we 're talking about . 
  wikipedia is pretty shit with these issues because it 's full of agenda editing and focus . 
  eu migration is very significant , currently over 150k per year net migration . 
  see : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30243472 http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/79366000/gif/_79366472_world_migration_624_v6.gif in terms of impact this is the most relevant graph : http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/79227000/gif/_79227835_uk_employment_624.gif we 're struggling with housing and services for this population growth rates , and also with issues of integration ( but to me this is not as pressing ) . 
  the benefits argument is basically that of the racists and does n't hold any water . 
  i 'd take the chance even if it meant economic hardship . 
  for me it 's a moral issue above everything . 
  i 'm voting out . 
  you are lumping together the commonwealth era . 
  talk about current migration . 
  having said that i was talking about population . 
  and wait until ukraine is in , and turkey get a visa-free travel agreement . 
  schengen is going to be a mess . 
  dutch or finnish ? 
  suffer ? 
  your trade surplus is destroying half of the eurozone . 
  i can hear the russian accent as i read that . 
  wait until they can enter visa-free in schengen . 
   what 's exactly the point of the article ? 
  that someone dared to mention that he was born in rural bangladesh ? 
  you are exactly right . 
  this `` otherness '' is basically gone for people who can speak with a british accent . 
  they are assumed to be from the commonwealth . 
  enoch powell is dead and buried outside of rural britain . 
  the opposite is true , but i guess it does n't sell as many books . 
  in britain , people like him are considered 100 % british by the vast majority of the population . 
  it 's other eu nationals that do n't quite accept them as such . 
  i see this everyday in my workplace . 
    obviously leicester are winning the league . 
   your statement was akin to `` obviously leicester are going to win the league . '', 
  i do n't make a significant distinction between the two . 
   if you are going to lie about what you 've even typed then just stop responding to me now . 
  you are a pedant to the nth degree . 
  lie ? 
    blah blah blah  the signs of someone who really knows what they 're talking about . 
  the signs of someone who is tired of your idiotic semantics . 
  i 'm going to use the new `` block user '' feature for the first time . 
  kindly fuck off with the `` liar '' shite . 
  that will be an impediment i 'm sure . 
  we may or may not achieve an opt-out in the negotiations . 
  the null hypothesis is a return to the previous regime . 
  which was n't visa-free . 
  then there 's the point that it would n't make sense to exit the eu and not leverage the borders . 
  not much to it really . 
  i 'm pro-brexit and these arguments do n't convince me at all . 
  obviously leicester are winning the league . 
  guarantee ? 
  i just believe that 's the major likelihood for the reasons stated in those messages . 
   that has absolutely no bearing on the debate . 
  yeah right . 
   blah blah blah, 
  by inflation , the people from europa.eu mean the hicp harmonised indicator , see https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/prices/hicp/html/index.en.html, 
  did i `` guarantee '' anything ? 
  i say that the previous situation was n't visa free for all of the eu , but basically only for r. of ireland . 
   where are you getting these ridiculous claims from ? 
  which claims ? 
  learn to read . 
  if visa-free immigration applied to the whole eu there would be almost no point in leaving the eu .
