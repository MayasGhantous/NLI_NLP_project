  if true . 
  absolutely . 
  the eu showing for what it is . 
  that graph is from nov 2012 : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13798000 it got worse after that but some has been paid since . 
  the general picture is more or less that still . 
  the point is that they already proved their reliability and accuracy back then . 
  yep , and that 's just the beginning . 
  the eu has a gargantuan task ahead with the debt of all the south of europe , of which greece is but a tiny bit . 
  there are much bigger fish on the brink . 
  mind you , this will affect the uk either way . 
  it 's not necessarily an argument for brexit in itself . 
  it depends on how it 's dealt with whether this brings the eu structure down or forward . 
  you ca n't watch footie these days on # 50 a month ... cheapest sky package was # 60 last year . 
  kids these days look a bit soft [ compared to other generations past ] ( http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/speeches-of-winston-churchill/92-blood-toil-tears-and-sweat ) . 
  http://i.imgur.com/ujtadwx.png but this does n't account for the domino effect . 
  emergency measures will be needed to rescue the banks and sovereign bonds of nations that would be bankrupt as a result of greece going bust . 
  posted [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4gomoh/imf_pressing_demands_outside_bailout_agreement/ ) and duly downvoted as it 's customary around here :d, 
  works for china and russia . 
  lol . 
  not really . 
  people in the uk can perfectly understand by now that there 's cynicism about the whole project fear rhetoric . 
  people in greece pay a lot of tax . 
  seems to me that you have n't even been to greece , or you play very well the part of having no idea about it . 
  greece can have their own currency just fine like they did in the past and like much lesser functioning countries do . 
  honestly i have n't studied the case for italy . 
  rome is probably fine geographically , i do n't know about other factors . 
  i was replying to the implication that being the most economically important means that a city `` should be '' the political capital . 
  look it up . 
  greece does export - although it did export a lot more before the eurozone ravaged it . 
  it 's a developed country with plenty of talent and education . 
  they will come out of it . 
  your reading comprehension is n't great , apparently . 
  i said that even in venezuela legal currency circulates and people have to use it . 
  that was his argument . 
  meaning that no matter how badly their drachma performs , people taking it wo n't be a problem . 
  you are constantly moving the goalposts . 
  the greek just need the drachma to circulate . 
  it will , no doubt , if it 's the legal currency . 
  end of story . 
  the rest are requirements you are making up as you go . 
  whether they save in gold , dollars , pounds or euros does n't matter for the original conversation . 
  we got your back . 
  let 's hope for a positive result . 
  the latest poll gives brexit a slight lead , and looking at the danish referendum from december this could actually turn out to be a solid victory . 
  here 's hoping !, 
  currently a lot of eu countries are in these debt numbers and they do n't have any significant growth to show for it . 
  for instance , italy . 
  it was more diversified prior to joining the euro . 
  they actually had an industrial sector , which is now essentially defunct . 
  also , with the new imposed tax regime they can not dream to compete in high-value-added sectors , or for talent , or in manufacturing . 
  diversification in particular is something that can not be argued to not be worse because of the eurozone . 
  you can probably argue for other parts of the economy . 
  not especially . 
  they 've done as well if not better in terms of growth and borrowing prior to joining the eurozone . 
  if i were greek and i wanted to keep any of my taxable property or business , then yeah i 'd need it and want it . 
  trust me the legal currency will circulate . 
  people are legally forced to take it . 
  it circulates even in venezuela . 
  no offence but greece is not a soviet state without a working market economy . 
  the problem with the collapse of the ussr is that industry was artificially tied together and centrally controlled . 
  greece can not be more different to that . 
   people just do n't pay . 
  tax evasion is already very big in greece , what do you think is going to happen when enforcers get paid shit ? 
  they stop enforcing the law , instead the use the threat of enforcement to get bribes . 
  the greek actually pay a lot of tax , which is why there 's so much evasion . 
  there are many taxes that are very easily enforceable . 
  people would need drachmas if they want to keep their houses , cars , property , etc. 
   the local currency stops being a unit of account , it becomes just a unit of exchange . 
  to this day you can see prices in ` contractual units ' in russia , where you pay in rubles price denominated in dollars at current rate . 
  i heard they are becoming much more popular in ukraine . 
   contractual units are the later phase , when some stabilization occurs and state gets more powerful . 
  the initial phase is total rejection . 
  again , greece has n't worked like a soviet economy ever in its long history . 
  there is no such transition to make . 
  yeah but it 's such a stupid argument to just assume that there will be weimar style hyperinflation . 
  note that i did n't use `` hyperinflation '' in my post . 
  you introduced the element of * stupid * yourself . 
  that 's a rather surreal proposition . 
  people will need drachmas to pay their tax . 
  in many other countries people informally use a different currency to save , and due to [ gresham ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gresham%27s_law ) they avoid using it for anything else . 
  there are many examples of this around the world . 
  sorry but your armageddon scenario is simply false . 
  if you make the situation in greece bad enough - imo it already is - it makes sense to repudiate debt and leave the eurozone and even the eu . 
  probably the right moment to do it , too , if not late already . 
  the understandable fear of the greek is a total lack of confidence on their own political class . 
  but this is something that ca n't and wo n't be sorted by the eu . 
  they will have to do it themselves eventually . 
   more and more greeks consider this a deal they might be willing to take ... 
  they should have done it in the wake of the overwhelming oxi result in the referendum . 
  greece , believe it or not , was a working economy before the euro that grew faster than most of europe ( including non-eu countries ) . 
  in fact it had a much more competitive industry . 
  unsurprisingly , seeing how the eurozone works . 
  yep , i 've also thought about this and shared in the sub [ before ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4eh3qu/imf_says_greek_debt_highly_unsustainable_debt/d20clmc ) . 
  see also : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4fy4h0/exclusive_greek_pm_says_crisis_nearly_over_no/ ... and most importantly : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4fxgcp/no_deal_between_greece_and_lenders_seen_on_friday/, 
  yeah , but when people talk about westminster they generally talk about the parliament and the * westminster district * . 
  ( http://i.imgur.com/t9qisyy.jpg ) the city of westminster is large and includes a variety of districts , some more residential than others . 
  the parliament is in the district proper . 
  when you talk about this area you generally do n't mean china town or other areas within the city of westminster . 
  where also very few people live , to be fair . 
  mostly a few bankers in the city and a few politicians in westminster .
