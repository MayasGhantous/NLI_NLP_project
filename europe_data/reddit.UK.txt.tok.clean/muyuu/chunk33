  this is definitely not the case in cornwall that they lack any awareness of the british money redirected their way by brussels . 
  it 's heavily publicised . 
  the smallest investment has a massive banner with an eu flag on it . 
  then it does n't explain anywhere near to that disparity and the decorrelation at the end of the financial crash slump . 
  in which period precisely ? 
  i do n't think population accounts for this because there 's a 20 % differential in just 7 years . 
  i 'm not that familiar with american politics but let 's suppose they are voting against their personal interest . 
  is that censurable in itself ? 
  it would be indicative of principle if anything at all . 
  saw this now , i see what you mean . 
  anyway it seems like the number provided in the pic does n't measure the same net figures as the rebate , so i do n't know if that would be indicative of the result . 
  ~ ~ 592.19 ~ ~ 569.44 euro per capita you mean with the number in the pic included ? 
  something is off with these numbers then . 
  maybe they are considering different factors in the net expenditure . 
  in 2014 our net contribution was $ 12.1 billion and the rebate was $ 6.2 which is around half that . 
  in more normal years it 's in the 60-70 % range . 
  having the rebate cancelled should almost double our per capita contribution , roughly ( it 's calculated one year in arrears ) . 
  not that these hypothetical situations matter that much . 
  they are certainly our cousins too . 
  i did n't mention because they pay much less than we would . 
  angles ( current germany , denmark , netherlands ) , jutes ( current denmark ) , saxons ( current saxony - germany , netherlands ) and normans ( mostly from current normandy and bretagne ) are all our close cousins . 
  norse and swedish in northern england and scotland , too . 
  mixed with our native peoples . 
  relax . 
  the situation on benefits is complex . 
  other countries have a social safety net system based on work , or they are transitioning to that so fm can be preserved with big disparities . 
  our system is linked mostly to residency and that 's making it rather unsustainable . 
  there 's also strong political resistance to change that . 
  we want to also care for those out of a job chronically and with other social difficulties . 
  a transition to something that could possibly fit everybody is not easy because we have a lot of people heavily dependent on the current system . 
  we can not sort it quickly enough to avert the migratory onslaught . 
  although i do think this problem is often overstated . 
  yep , and without the rebate the uk would be up there with our cousins from sweden , denmark and netherlands . 
  huh ? 
  definitely not yours . 
  as you 'd say , `` lol '' . 
  not something i would use at work but , for instance , the sort of speculation you see all the time in financial times , the economist , frankfurter allgemeine , etc. 
  in fact you see much , much worse . 
  one can not look at graphs and take scientifically proven conclusions almost never in economics . 
  that 's just the very nature of so-called social sciences . 
  that 's what i 'm personally voting for , no eea at all . 
  we may not share the optimism in the aftermath of that i personally have . 
  which is fine . 
  that 's debt to gdp and i actually make a point to put a lot more of the context . 
  no more data available in the google data set . 
  play with it as you want : https://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;idim=country:fi:se:no&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=gd_pc_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:fi:se:el:uk:es&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false, 
  note : i 'm just posting the article . 
  i do n't necessarily agree with it . 
  disclaimer : i 'm voting leave . 
  most conclusions you make in economics are speculative , yes . 
  as any scientist working in finance can confirm . 
  disclaimer : am one . 
  i can perfectly speculate that it has something to do with the ez debt crisis which also affects fin . 
  reply to the other comment that seems to have gone missing . 
  if you want me to delete this just let me know . 
   ioubduate  well there was a story that the eu put some talks on a joined eu army on the agenda right after the referendum , but that someone saw it . 
  the main reason that has n't happened is that the uk spoke up against the idea . 
  several things have been postponed because they perceive it could help the brexit case . 
  in other words , you do n't want to show the real workings of the eu now that people are paying attention . 
  for better or worse , most people in the uk would vote out if they were confronted with the real plan of so-called `` project europe . '', 
  only popular and uncontroversial developments - from the uk 's point of view - are supposed to happen now . 
  as mentioned in the other comment : speculative . 
  swe recovers from the financial crisis as fin lingers in the ez debt crisis . 
  the dates match perfectly . 
  admittedly speculative , as most matters in economics . 
  i hope you are right . 
  it would be a shame if a late offer from brussels came and impacted the result . 
  because their principles are not for sale ? 
  who knows , but it hardly is an argument towards a higher ground in the remain side . 
  if brexit is way ahead in the polls closer to the referendum , i would n't be surprised if something else was offered from brussels to swing the vote . 
  he was actually right . 
  which is why it 's delicate to make decisions on individual selfish points of view . 
  macro-economically , joining would have been a disaster . 
  from an exporter point of view , it would have been an immediate benefit . 
  focus will move to something else . 
  but the background noise will be there whatever the result . 
  it 's always there already . 
  the only thing that would remedy that would be that in a few years , whatever the winning option is appears to be * extremely * vindicated . 
  i guess you can move to the eu afterwards . 
  at the very least for two years , no questions asked . 
  then after these two years post article 50 , * maybe * face a regular immigration process .

  that 's amazing . 
  they 've been playing well lately as well . 
  i included this information in https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4nh1p6/proposed_longterm_solutions_for_the_eurozone/ through i did n't refer to pce specifically . 
  feel free to comment there as well ( although it 's also modbombed ) . 
  no , this is entirely done in my free time and not for monetary profit . 
  i think the topic is interesting though , it 's a shame that so many people seem to be downvoting it . 
  but then again this sub is n't the best for critical discussion of anything . 
  do n't worry mate , i 'm enjoying it . 
  but this is a different topic . 
  there 's life other than brexit . 
  the ez needs to be fixed anyway or it will cause a global crisis when it crashes . 
  also , goodness of my heart too . 
  strangely there are no ez break-up proposals there .

  we 'll soon find out . 
  downvoted because ... not / r/europe 's approved narrative i guess . 
  good news for those who do n't want the parliament to force a norway-style deal in case of brexit . 
  that 's right .
