   to be fair , most people ( at least here ) vote based on national issues , not eu ones . 
  most people do n't vote , and those who do ignore that they are voting for the ep . 
  it 's completely dysfunctional even ignoring other governance issues . 
  on the bright side , it does n't matter as far as they do n't control germany and france . 
  other countries matter little . 
  eu anti-democracy to the rescue xd, 
   if you look at how badly the cypriot economy has been doing the last years that 's one way to put it . 
  when the eu imposes the cypriot government to violate very sensible and basic principles of their constitution to rob their own citizens , i 'm not surprised at all that the eu is not very popular there . 
  greek parliament approves austerity vote to secure bailout cash parliamentary vote comes ahead of eurozone finance ministers meeting on disbursement of funds updated may 22 , 2016 6:42 p.m. 
  et athens -- greece 's parliament approved a raft of fresh taxes and austerity measures that the country must legislate to unlock further rescue loans , as the country 's most influential creditors -- germany and the international monetary fund -- remain deadlocked over debt relief . 
  the measures were backed by the 153 lawmakers from the ruling syriza party and its junior coalition partner , the independent greeks , securing the majority in the 300-seat parliament late sunday . 
  but syriza lawmaker vasiliki katrivanou voted against two of the measures included in the bill . 
  early monday , mrs. katrivanou announced her resignation from parliament . 
  another syriza candidate from the prior elections , george kyritsis , will run in her stead . 
  parliamentary approval could pave the way for eurozone finance ministers meeting on tuesday to clear the next disbursement of funds to greece . 
  but that could be complicated as the imf and eurozone governments and especially germany remain at odds over when greece should get debt relief and how deep it should be . 
  `` european leaders get the message tonight that greece meets its obligations , '' prime minister alexis tsipras told lawmakers ahead of the vote . 
  `` starting from tomorrow it remains that the other side meets its own and i think this will happen . '' he said the country 's financial spring would start in 2017 and predicts 3 % economic growth in that year . 
  the imf has said it would only sign up to the greek bailout if germany agrees to debt relief . 
  but german officials are seeking to delay any debt restructuring until the end of the current greek bailout program in 2018 , so that germany 's parliament , the bundestag , would pass such measures only after germany 's 2017 elections . 
  to meet its targets , athens was asked to set up a contingency mechanism of additional austerity measures equal to some 2 % of gross domestic product . 
  the measures being voted on sunday included new taxes on fuel , tobacco , alcohol , internet , pay television , hotel stays , cars , changes in property tax , as well as a rise in the basic value-added tax rate , applied to most goods and services , to 24 % from 23 % . 
  it also includes the framework that would free up the sale of nonperforming loans owned by greek banks , as well as the establishment of a new privatization fund that would manage its assets to execute its investment policy and reduce its debt . 
  the greek parliament is also expected to vote on the fiscal brake mechanism that would automatically cut state spending if greece misses its budget targets . 
  mrs. katrivanou voted against the contingency mechanism and the new privatization fund . 
  in contrast with the european institutions overseeing the bailout -- the european commission and the european central bank -- the imf says athens wo n't be able to reach its bailout targets and generate a 3.5 % budget surplus when stripping out interest payments in 2018 , based on the austerity measures . 
  ep elections in 2019 are going to be interesting . 
  hopefully telecommuting :-d, 
  essentially yes . 
  they promised to spend most of their time in the uk campaigning for brexit , and openly refused to participate in most ep votes unrelated to the uk . 
  they did exactly as promised to their voters beforehand . 
  ca n't see any problem in that . 
  this is why they are n't too vocal about it . 
  they say feel-good things like `` europe/the west is stronger united '' and nonsense like that , as if the eu = europe . 
  that also does n't earn much . 
  i think they are doing what 's expected . 
  what would you consider a positive case ? 
  the uk would n't lose anything by leaving the eu other than by the eu refusing to collaborate or outright sabotaging the uk after the fact . 
  so that 's what they are threatening . 
  they do n't have anything else , essentially . 
  except you mean something different . 
  ps : if it 's you with the downvotes , i 'd suggest you man up . 
  just try clicking on the first one . 
  http://www.politico.eu/article/jean-claude-juncker-deserters-not-welcomed-back-after-brexit-leave-remain-uk-referendum-eu/  the u.k. 's relationship with the eu would be badly damaged in the event of a brexit and `` deserters will not be welcomed back with open arms , '' european commission president jean-claude juncker said in an interview published friday . 
  does that count to you as coming out against brexit ? 
  i 'd say so . 
  this happened last friday . 
  almost every day some eu leader speaks out against brexit to some degree . 
  which of these figures are wrong ?

  you do n't need to trust farage . 
  these figures are public . 
  many countries such as ... italy maybe ? 
  most politicians do n't make nearly as much , and they have to be elected to top posts . 
  they also do n't have these transitional package going into what already is a very generous pension . 
  you just missed it , because a few eu leaders certainly have come out against the uk leaving . 
  i 'm firmly in that boat and i intend to vote leave . 
  the underlying cultural shock it shows is that in the uk many of us see an ideal eu * extremely * differently compared to what the majority of people from central europe envision . 
  so for them , nothing of this makes sense . 
  hehe ... do n't worry man , i will recover from this psychological blow . 
  it does come across that way , yes . 
  nothing terribly important anyway . 
  it seems like a perfectly fair assessment to me . 
  your pointing out of the source being british is ironic in the context of your message . 
  but they double down on central planing . 
  if oil drops down to sub - $ 40 again , it will be doom and gloom again for them . 
  not much has changed . 
  typical swede according to this website : http://www.interpol.int/notice/search/wanted/ ( requestingcountry ) / 290 / ( current_age_maxi ) / 100 / ( search ) / 1 http://i.imgur.com/oqcga1c.png, 
  that 's right , i worded that incorrectly as evidence shows that humans were earlier adapted to higher sunlight than the other way around . 
  the point is that racially some ethnics are adapted to higher sunlight , and others are adapted to lower sunlight . 
  it 's not if she considers her model of society to be the ideal one . 
  in the west we often look down on these traditional societies , but it 's a two-way street . 
  moral values are entirely subjective . 
  this may sound racist , but in african countries native ethnicities ~ ~ have genetically adapted ~ ~ are naturally better suited to higher sunlight exposure via skin pigmentation . 
  vitamin d is islamophobic . 
  you seem to have completely missed the point of what i meant there . 
  the delusion some people have is that we can just rule the eu/ez as soon as we want to , displacing the current biggest players , concretely germany . 
  utter delusions of grandeur given the current situation and the past results . 
  not in eastern europe . 
  ukraine is often as cold and some months colder than iceland or southern sweden . 
  being so far away from the azores high makes eastern countries colder than their latitude would usually imply . 
  if you like it super-cold and still with many hours of light , siberia is your place . 
  the delusion is that we would immediately lead the eu if we `` bothered trying '' - or at least in any way meaningful to us ( we 're not interested on imposing random internal regulations to other countries ) . 
   the fact that you claim the majority `` does not believe in the concept `` might be true ... but its just illogical to complain about missing influence when the intention is to abolish the whole thing . 
  this is because we 're conflating many different things . 
  we wo n't lead in what we want which is no federal eu superstate , and we have tried our best to that end . 
  we might lead in ways that either do n't matter to us or do n't compensate for being imposed on what we do n't agree which is massive to us . 
  so yeah we 'd rather `` abolish '' the whole thing , although i think you are overstating it . 
  we 'd just carry on our own way separately . 
  that 's just the delusion of some toffs over here , and in any case the ez has long term problems that will eventually make it implode . 
  or at least what many of us believe . 
  it 's a project we do n't believe in for a number of reasons . 
  if only i could be so optimistic . 
  for starters bookies are giving 80 % + of bremain , so we 'll see ... 
  that 's true . 
  i guess europe was defined as in 1800 . 
  which would explain that there are no greek cities either . 
  some greek and balkan cities would be listed there . 
  belgrade is n't listed , and it was one of the biggest cities of europe [ circa 1650 ( ~ 100k ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_belgrade ) .
