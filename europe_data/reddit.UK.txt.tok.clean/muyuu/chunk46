  maybe countries are more supportive of free movement than they were in the 1980s , but that would be expected anyway given how long it has been established . 
  although i do n't rank migration so high , it certainly it 's not the same after the expansion eastward . 
  we signed the treaties for what they meant at the time , not their personal opinions and diaries . 
  we also signed a treaty that allows member states to leave . 
  as did all other members ( with varying levels of legitimacy it must be said ) . 
  the one thing i like about the [ tol ] ( http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html ) . 
   i 'm pretty sure jean monnet and robert schuman had a clear idea of what they wanted to create when they used the word `` federalism '' . 
   too bad that they do n't represent the totality of the member states , let alone the continent . 
   and if you want to go even farther with people who did not write anything in the treaties , segovia talked in 1543 about `` united states of europe '' . 
  victor hugo in 1849 did as well . 
  in 1930 paul val\u00e9ry presented a memorandum about `` the organisation of the federal union of europe '' . 
  so yes , i know that europe is not the eu . 
  but the eu and all structures that led to it were born from those people and their ideas and texts . 
  all of that has fuck-all to do with today 's eu . 
  you 'd hope we know better about today 's issues than them . 
   unless you mean `` residence '' in the sense of `` residing in a country without also working in that country '' ? 
  in this case people are legally required to be able to support themselves . 
  de facto it meant that you would n't move and then look for a job . 
  maastricht was a game changer . 
   maybe your problem is with enlargement rather than with freedom of movement per se ? 
  it 's neither , but it does n't help things . 
  the combination of including substantially poorer countries with the new provisions makes a difference . 
  however for me these problems are relatively secondary . 
  the structure of the ec/ep and voting are the number one problem imo . 
  there is no changing this within the current framework . 
  also , the lack of explicit limits for the erosion of national sovereignty . 
  from the get go there was disagreement on the endgame of that the eu would be . 
  note that `` europe '' is not the eu . 
  previous attempts found a lot of resistance . 
  imagine several countries kicked out of the euro ( or `` invited to leave the eurozone '' ) while remaining in the eu ? 
  if that happens it will be very , very tense . 
  there 's a big difference between the provisions of paris , rome and then maastricht . 
  in paris 1951 , it was limited to certain industries . 
  in rome , for all industries but in origin and without residence . 
  in maastricht , it was expanded to residency ( the fmp part , note i included both ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement_for_workers_in_the_european_union  ** freedom of movement and residence for persons in the eu is the cornerstone of union citizenship ** , which was established by the treaty of maastricht in 1992 . 
  its practical implementation in eu law , however , has not been straightforward . 
  it first involved the gradual phasing out , of internal borders under the schengen agreements , initially in just a handful of member states . 
  today , the provisions governing the free movement of persons are laid down in directive 2004/38/ec on the right of eu citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states . 
  however , the implementation of this directive continues to face many obstacles . 
  [ 6 ] and this is where imo the union was made tight enough that extending it to the east further than eu15 was a big mistake and causes serious imbalances within the union . 
  the other big mistake is the euro . 
  then there 's legislation creep and the lack of limits , checks and balances . 
  what worked with 12 or 15 does n't necessarily work right to the border with russia and turkey . 
  you must be very young and/or you do n't see how we systematically are forced into schemes we do n't want in the eu . 
  also , how things are panning out in the ec and the ep . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4fmvib/uks_waning_voice_in_the_eu/ it just does n't stand to scrutiny that the eu is moving in the direction we want . 
  cameron is peddling that very strongly . 
  it 's a good argument to keep the eu/eec at a level that most of europe can feel comfortable with , instead of pushing things towards a model some members can not support . 
  certainly it 's possible that developments accelerate as a result of us leaving , in whatever direction . 
  however , it does look to me like the eurozone can not afford it and the tensions will be huge . 
  we 'll hopefully find out relatively soon . 
  the course of the eu is clearly opposed to the kind of change we want . 
  we 've been trying for decades but it 's time to call it quits . 
  the eec did n't include fmp/fmw . 
  that 's a maastricht development . 
   `` poor logic '' , yet you want to dissolve an organisation that others want ; and you claim it 's undemocratic . 
  i 'm just voting for it . 
  not imposing it . 
  you seem to struggle with the concept of a referendum . 
   so you literally whine about insults and then insult me ? 
  10/10 , seeing that you remain unbanned after all the personal attacks you shower around , it 's fair game to treat you like you deserve . 
   please do standup . 
  you got that covered for me . 
  he 's limited like that . 
  insufferable on this issue with poor logic and no effort , just like above . 
  oh , and insults . 
  yeah well , this is allowed . 
  other than violations of the advertising standards authority 's rules , only the mayor can veto an ad . 
  this happened once , when boris vetoed [ this one ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/12/anti-gay-adverts-boris-johnson ) . 
  this ban was [ fought tooth and nail ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-25909961 ) . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4iiv3n/allah_is_great_ads_displayed_on_london_buses/d2yfo7u yep , misleading headline . 
  the ideal outcome would be a total dissolution of the current institutions , going back to the eec essentially . 
  which covers the economy supremacy and trade disputes bit . 
  but let 's not pretend this outcome will automatically happen as a result of brexit . 
  i 'll take just leaving the eu and any further advances towards the end of an undemocratic union in the continent will be welcome . 
  by overreaching , the eu jeopardised what was functional and possible . 
  it does n't say that . 
  it says `` glory to god '' which is not a claim . 
  nope , it was strategically sound to join the eec and try to shape it into something good . 
  there were conflicting visions on the directions it should take , but that 's normal and okay . 
  some countries have switched their visions back and forth , like for instance france depending on who was in their government . 
  there were some atheist ads on london buses actually . 
  they were intended to say `` god does n't exist '' - but they were forced to change them because they could n't prove the veracity of the ad , so they ended saying `` god probably does n't exist '' / `` there is probably no god '' . 
  wrong . 
  that means `` glory to god '' . 
   it is because it is designed this way . 
  no one is supposed to opt out . 
  there is not exit because it is meant to be a constitution of a state , and when all our governments signed , and referendums were made , we all knew it . 
   except this is n't the case at all . 
  we joined the eec , the rest has been a slippery slope . 
  we have systematically resisted every federalisation push , including veiled ones like the common currency . 
  the only question for us now is how do we better resist federal europe , from the outside or from the inside . 
  they 're too dysfunctional to make this happen . 
  germany and france run the show , and they would get a massive hit by losing the british market . 
  on the other hand we have the wto baseline which will be enough for us to improve on our current situation , and they know it . 
  we have by far the best hand . 
  literally doomsday . 
  the eu is characteristically incompetent in this issue as in many others . 
  they will leave the issue to rot and then when there 's no other option , then a couple of * leaders * will take charge .
