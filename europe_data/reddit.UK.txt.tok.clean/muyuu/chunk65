  different bank holidays , different business times , etc. 
  tzs are a relic really . 
  does n't mean they 're going away anytime soon , though . 
  they still used to say the hour all the time years ago , and follow up with the canary islands mention . 
  it 's just something that has changed over the years . 
  also , fewer people listen to the radio now compared to 20 or 30 years ago . 
  nothing about me concerns you and this does n't stop you from replying my comments with your nonsense . 
  japan does n't have daylight saving time , neither do taiwan or china . 
  perfectly feasible if you want to do it . 
  then again it 's the same as cet - artificially kept by several countries . 
  with tariffs . 
  the current statu quo . 
  japanese cars would immediately be a much better deal if not for the tariffs . 
  it 's not a concern , it 's a prediction . 
  there 's no way they 'd allow `` free-trade '' ( 0 % tariffs and duties ) of japanese industrial imports . 
  that would be extremely damaging for germany , so it 's not going to happen . 
  a minimum 10 % import tariff , that 's the difference . 
  japanese cars are ridiculously competitive . 
  let them build some economy of scale in europe and they will be everywhere , as they are in the arabian gulf for instance . 
  geographically no question about it , politically it makes less sense to them partly because of the latitude and also because of having 1 extra hour difference with the rest of spain . 
  iceland is also in gmt for political reasons . 
  it used to be in uk 's influence area . 
  also 1 hour difference with scandinavia is easier to deal with than 2 . 
  yeah , but since days are always long enough in the canaries ( closer to the equator ) it does n't make a big difference to them . 
  compare http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/santa-cruz-de-tenerife.html to http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/aberdeen.html, 
  in the 90s , you tuned in to any spanish tv broadcaster and every other programme would start by mentioning the time and the `` una hora menos en canarias '' following it . 
  sports , news , quiz programmes ... everything . 
  this seems to have gone out of fashion sometime in the 2000s . 
  i do n't think it would be much of a free-trade deal , unless the eu industry wants to be wiped by japanese imports . 
  eh , i remember they used to say that all the time in the 90s . 
  but recently i noticed they do n't mention for the most part when i visit . 
  maybe because of the internet taking over for reference . 
  actually the canaries and iceland would be a bit in the middle , probably closer to gmt-1 than gmt but not very noticeably so . 
  the canaries are in gmt and they are the # 1 touristic destination in spain . 
  it really does n't matter . 
  the days are long in the summer and the nights are also part of the reason tourists go there . 
  yeah , that idea is actually the same idea the fascists had - and it 's not a bad idea regardless . 
  but the countries in the west are noticeably offset . 
  nowadays i do n't think it makes sense to have time-zones at all to be fair . 
  it 's not set in stone that people have to go to work in the same nominal hour everywhere . 
  also international business already works 24h around the clock . 
  summer time also makes no sense , particularly in countries like spain where the length of day does n't vary as much as it does in the uk from summer to winter . 
  france also changed from gmt to cet in fascist times . 
  the balearics are just fine in gmt as they 're very very close to the 0 meridian . 
  http://i.imgur.com/qvjk0o2.png even france should be in gmt . 
  bring it on . 
  same tz as the uk , iceland and the canaries . 
  and japan . 
  and , well , ex-colonies of britain are a big part of the world . 
  it 's a beautiful , beautiful wall . 
  i did n't expect a 1h :30 m video when you said `` short '' . 
  it 's decent , though . 
  some people are more accustomed to particular accents . 
  these in the video are not hard imo . 
  they 're consciously talking to tv and it 's not like they 'd talk in a different setting . 
  however they do have a different accent and intonation that may confuse some . 
   that will be final nail in the coffin ... of the ez . 
  italy would do just fine . 
  jpeg for text , we meet again . 
  fine by me , i had not seen it . 
  i 'm not sure why do you assume i blame the eu for that . 
  if you look at my post , i said that the uk government took this path , and so did the eu as a whole in recent times . 
  these are two separate phenomena . 
  `` decades '' since 1990 , highs and lows and currently +12 % http://fxtop.com/php/compgraph.php?c1a=eur&amp;c1b=usd&amp;c2a=eur&amp;c2b=gbp&amp;c3a=eur&amp;c3b=jpy&amp;c4a=eur&amp;c4b=chf&amp;c5a=eur&amp;c5b=&amp;c6a=eur&amp;c6b=&amp;c7a=eur&amp;c7b=&amp;c8a=eur&amp;c8b=&amp;c9a=eur&amp;c9b=&amp;c10a=eur&amp;c10b=&amp;dd1=01&amp;mm1=01&amp;yyyy1=1990&amp;dd2=12&amp;mm2=12&amp;yyyy2=2016&amp;large=0&amp;m=1&amp;lang=en, 
  also because brexit was justified already from the pov of the people who voted for it . 
  not talking about justifications for brexit . 
  not as much as the euro over the last decade actually . 
  it 's actually above the decade 's average against most currencies other than the us$ ( and the chf ) , after a period of being pretty high despite having a trade deficit . 
  afaic it 's better this way than at 1.44 $ to the # . 
  over what period ? 
  against the cny and the jpy it 's * above * the decade 's average . 
  so yeah , bollocks . 
  against the dollar , yes . 
  not against almost anything else . 
  the gbp is just fine . 
  i trade currencies often and the euro has a worse outlook than the gbp , which is actually looking rather solid after a period of volatility . 
  most of our trade happens vs the eur and the usd . 
  so no , we do n't have a particularly weak pound at the moment , not in any way that consumers will be hit . 
  they will notice mostly the rise in price of us exports since 2014 , and that 's that . 
  the social contract was broken when the have-nots were left to their own devices . 
  it 's also the path chosen by the eu at the moment . 
   but it can and it will . 
  we 'll see about that , esp . 
  compared to the ez . 
  there are many accents in the uk , it takes some time to get used to them . 
  you may have not heard many people with thick accents from the north , they do n't get much exposure on tv and when they do it 's usually the `` posh '' ones . 
  lol `` apart from british colonies '' - which are actually most of asia in population . 
  also , some are rich and some are poor , being 3rd world does n't deny these african countries existence . 
  if we are only counting rich countries , then eastern europe does n't count either , huh ? 
  best in 14 months is n't that exceptional after the economy in that period . 
  for better or worse , nothing truly exceptional is happening . 
  retail is doing a bit better than recently , that 's all . 
  the pound is back to ~ 1.20 euro , which is approximately the average of the decade . 
  sorry if this does n't fit your narrative .

  in spain the traditional way is to give the gifts in the epiphany ( biblical magi bringing gifts to jesus being why gifts are given ) . 
  the old man giving gifts in the winter solstice is a very widespread old pagan tradition from across europe , which i guess some countries have adopted by matching it with saint nicholas or the coca cola red santa :d .
