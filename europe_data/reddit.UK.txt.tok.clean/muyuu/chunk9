  it 's reality . 
  you keep repeating to yourself i say `` stupid things '' and you say `` very intelligent things '' but you keep on babbling nonsense . 
  funny how that works huh ? 
  people have differing points of view on the quality of what they say . 
   by your criteria so is every country on the planet ... no , absolutely not . 
  you can keep making up things `` to make me look like a fool '' but you still made it up . 
   `` i ca n't argue against what you 're saying because i know i 'll just look a fool . '', 
  this is just a waste of time . 
  turkey is not getting any closer to be `` europe '' in any sense of the word . 
  maybe by the * eu * ( not europe ) becoming more of a dictatorship . 
  turkey is 97 % in asia minor , by the way . 
  might as well annex israel , or japan . 
  much more democratic countries than turkey . 
   what a stupid thing to say ... `` i disagree , therefore it 's stupid '' . 
  oh , and it 's you who is `` all emotion , no facts '' haha . 
   40 years ago romania hungary poland and even parts of germany were regressive autocratic communist dictatorships ... at least they are located in europe . 
  as for dictatorships , that can easily be argued . 
  it 's just pointless . 
  by the way it was a mistake to include these as the eu stands . 
  massive disparities and labour freedom of movement just do n't mix . 
   all waffle , all emotion , no facts . 
  i share this opinion of your posts . 
   this is just wrong and provably so , jesus you 're one of the dumbest people i 've ever met . 
  i think you are a total moron , but you just insist on replying to my posts despite being told repeatedly that i have no interest in debating with you . 
   typical eurosceptic . 
  i love europe , i despise the eu . 
  not the same . 
  let it be . 
  they 're still in time . 
  it 's also a complete delusion , on top of us not wanting it . 
  we have little power in the eu and we have a fundamentally different vision to the dominating members in the ep . 
  they have n't improved . 
  what has improved is that via inflation the eurozone members have paid a part of it . 
  keeping this going for another 40 years seems extreme . 
  their gdp is still in a decreasing trend and they are running a deficit even if they briefly hit a * primary * surplus . 
  their social spending is very low now so there is n't much to cut that is n't at the cost of their very repayment capability . 
  they have to pay back an average of around 9bn $ / year for 40 + years . 
  but the best part is that this year they have to pay much more and they will resist any extra conditions . 
  for sure they will be asked for extra conditions . 
  therefore , shit is about to go down . 
  corrected . 
  but why is that . 
  because of the sentiment of the press ? 
  because if you look at the numbers , you will see there is no way they will be able to face their repayments no matter how you spread them . 
  i guess they will be offered something slightly better for their silence . 
  but we 'll see how much they ask for . 
  judging from previous history , i expect noise . 
   it must be infuriating having people prove you wrong all the time , no wonder you blocked me . 
  nah , not proving anything wrong but constantly misquoting stuff and reading things wrong for others . 
  like in this stupid conversation for instance . 
  `` is 15-40 years in the cards for you ? '', 
  yes . 
  yes it is . 
  and there you go , digging more and more nonsense . 
   yet you ca n't argue against what i 've said , strange that is n't it ? 
  because there is nothing to argue . 
  currently , both ukraine and turkey are in the cards and considered for joining . 
  that 's the way it is , and there is no argument to make . 
  if we say , which i hope we do n't , i hope we can help stop that nonsense - although we do n't have that much of a say . 
  particularly the turkish bid is a terrible idea and it will always be so long as turkey is turkey . 
  it 's essentially the same point when you are talking about 35 + years in the future in roll-overs . 
  they will need a write-off to reach this point or anywhere near , or a de-facto write-off through inflation which is already happening really , to help the rest of the pigs who also can not pay their debts . 
  still nowhere near to being able to pay their debt . 
  syriza may be shit , but they are not the ones who imposed their current economic policy , which is the funny thing . 
  greece completely surrendered their economic sovereignty and they are still somehow to blame that massive cuts lead to much lower consumption and economic growth . 
  the whole story is a massive farce . 
  should n't have removed you from my blocked list but you were replying to me randomly and misguiding people . 
  if you stop replying to me i can safely put you back in my block list and move on from this waste of time . 
   is it not more likely that you 're just getting angry at how foolish i 'm making you look , because of your refusal to do some actual research ? 
  you do make me laugh sometimes though with nonsense like this . 
  `` foolish '' :d said the total fool . 
  there 's such thing as unsustainable debt . 
  greece would n't be able to pay even just the interest of their debt . 
  no matter how long you make the period it would just compound more and more . 
  obviously if you pay the interest for them via inflation then technically they could deal with it . 
  but that 's just paying their debt via a monetary subterfuge . 
  it 's equivalent to just pay most of it with eurozone taxpayer money and just be done with it . 
  ever since the leak earlier this month , the shitstorm has been very predictable if it was n't even earlier . 
  see : - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36090188 - http://www.globalresearch.ca/imf-and-troika-want-still-more-austerity-from-greece-the-wikileaks-revelation/5520563  the eurozone and greek economies have been deteriorating since last august . 
  still more austerity would thus be needed , according to the discussions among the imf participants in the teleconference . 
  and to get greece to agree , ** perhaps a new ` crisis event ' would have to be provoked ** . 
  - https://wikileaks.org/imf-internal-20160319/ [ ... ]  velkouleskou : i am hoping it 's going to happen with these debt discussions that are starting in mid april . 
   thomsen : but that is not an event . 
  that is not going to cause them to ... that discussion can go on for a long time . 
  and they are just leading them down the road ... ** why are they leading them down the road ? 
  because they are not close to the event , whatever it is . 
  **  velkouleskou : ** i agree that we need an event , but i do n't know what that will be . 
  but i think dijsselbloem is trying not to generate an event , but to jump start this discussion somehow on debt , that essentially is about us being on board or not at the end of the day . 
  **  thomsen : yeah , but you know , that discussion of the measures and the discussion of the debt can go on forever , until some high up . . until they hit the july payment or until the leaders decide that we need to come to an agreement . 
  but there is nothing in there that otherwise is going to force a compromise . 
  right ? 
  it is going to go on forever . 
   velkouleskou : it will , yes , until july , if nothing happens beforehand . 
  i agree . 
   thomsen : ok . 
  i do n't know , let 's see . 
  i hope for the sake of the greeks that we are going to find a solution soon ... 
  i mean , let 's face it , you guys are not going agree on ... these discussions that you have out there , they 're not going to lead to ... they are not going to come around to accept our views . 
  right ? 
  they are not !,
