  it does , sharia courts operate under the arbitration act 1996 . 
  plus it 's hard to see what foreign assets they have, 
  he speaks french as well, 
  why was that deleted ? 
  what a stupid law , is that why google street view does n't go to germany as well ? 
  we have that in london, 
  no cctv at german train stations ? 
  it 's quite funny really , our tea addiction was stronger than opium, 
  that looks accidental , minor , and it was shot down after leaving turkish airspace which it was only over for about 2km , seconds in a jet . 
  turkey 's got some answering to do if this is correct . 
  [ russian war planes capable of dropping nukes violate british airspace all the time , we 've never shot one down ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1260381/raf-jets-intercept-russian-bombers-flying-british-airspace.html ), 
  well i do n't really want to google the natural oxidation rate of ammonium nitrate bombs and their components , or how to store them or the components , but from what i heard after the failed bombings of london on the 21st of july 2005 , they degrade and they need to be used pretty quickly . 
  now that i 've said that - hi qchq/cia annalist !, 
  they use fertiliser bombs , they degrade rapidly , so they have to use them within a few days of making them . 
  have n't confirmed caught them yet, 
  i think motive is the key really , if they were doing the shootings because of a christian crusade it would be different . 
  it 's straight out of political history , we ca n't convince anyone he did it , but we can make him deny it . 
  hunter s. thompson wrote : and his sense of the bizarre knows no bounds , as in this ` ancient and honourable ' story of how lyndon johnson first got elected to congress in 1948 when his opponent was a wealthy and politically favoured pig farmer : ` lyndon was running about 10 points behind , with only nine days to go ... 
  he was sunk in despair . 
  he was desperate ... he called his equally depressed campaign manager and instructed him to call a press conference at two or two-thirty ( just after lunch on a slow news day ) and accuse his high-riding opponent ( the pig farmer ) of having routine carnal knowledge of his barnyard sows , despite the pleas of his wife and children ... his campaign manager was shocked . 
  ` we ca n't say that , lyndon , ' he said . 
  ` it 's not true . ', 
  ` of course it 's not , ' johnson barked at him , ` but let 's make the bastard deny it . ', 
  no , a lord alleged he put his dick in a pigs head as part of an initiation ceremony to join the piers gaveston society while he was at oxford university , a bit like joining a fraternity in the us . 
  the pm says he was n't part of that society . 
  he was however in the bullingdon club which has some other bizarre rumoured initiation rituals , none of them involving putting body parts in pigs heads though . 
  what if you 're a buddhist ? 
  can you have a swastika for religious purposes ? 
  so if you put swastika into google image search it wo n't come up ? 
  how the he 'll are gm crops a global issue ? 
  but we want less integration and a smaller less powerful eu with more powers for sovereign states . 
  we do n't achieve what we want to by greater integration . 
  if we went along with that it would bolster the german vision for europe , not act as a counterweight . 
  so we do what the germans want , and not what the uk wants to give the germans less power ? 
  huh ? 
  german rules or us rules , what a choice !, 
  the world was a different place back then , we do n't need the eu to prevent war when most eu members are members of nato anyway . 
  well this is the problem , people in britain do n't want a bigger or more powerful eu , we want it scaled back to a trade agreement . 
  germany wants a more powerful closer eu . 
  so far it has only gone germany 's way . 
  i like this, 
  no term limits for mayor . 
  the us gives foreign intelligence agencies funding so they share information with them . 
  old people moan about anything . 
  there 's billions of humans , while polar bears are endangered, 
  best i can do - 3 refugees and a polar bear walk into a bar . 
  the barman turns to the first refugee and says `` what do you want '' `` a job '' replies the refugee he asks the second refugee what he wants `` a job '' and the third `` a job '' the barman turns to the polar bear and says `` i suppose you want a job as well '' `` no '' says the polar bear `` just some ice '', 
  no punchline , it just actually happened, 
  not to the same extent, 
  uk does . 
   the eu has never been ` just a trade bloc ' . 
  it was the eec , a trade bloc before 1993 . 
  this article is nonsense , the only argument it gives against her speech is one sound bite that from a 72 page document that states ; `` there is relatively little evidence that migration has caused statistically significant displacement of uk natives from the labour market in periods when the economy is strong . '', 
  little evidence is collected on the matter . 
  the same report states ; `` natives who have skills that are substitutes to the skill composition of the incoming immigrant population may be negatively impacted '' and `` these models suggest that there may be negative short-term impacts of migration on labour market outcomes for natives . '', 
  and '' ** negative effects on overall native employment ** '' and '' ** negative wage impacts for those in low-skilled occupations ** . '', 
  and ** `` significant negative impact on the native employment rate from increased migration . 
  '' ** and `` negative displacement effect on low-skilled workers and a small positive effect on the higher skilled . '', 
  there are loads more of these in the exact same report quoted in the article . 
  the journalist in question ignored all of these and gave one soundbite simply suggesting not enough evidence . 
  at first i thought `` woo !, 
  england is really influential !, 
  suck it scotland and scandinavia ! '' . 
  then i read in what we were influencing , and was n't proud . 
  the beagle 2 was actually just a miniature tank . 
  blowing up pubs and department stores, 
  good . 
  the ft has been wank since it was sold to the nikkei anyway, 
  how many papers do you read ? 
  i barely have time for one, 
  i really love documentaries on bbc 4, 
  irish talent plus brit money = father ted brit talent + us money = game of thrones ca n't wait to see what the yanks do with the space bucks, 
  bbc 4 closes . 
  bbc one shuts down and broadcasts bbc news 24 and then bbc world service , and bbc 2 shows programmes for the deaf ( sign zone i think it 's called ), 
  deal . 
  wait until you see all of the programmes like the one show , citizen khan and victoria derbishire and not just attenborugh , top gear and dr who . 
  nope , i 'm certain it 's you, 
  what a nonsensical comparison , it 's like i 'm talking to a moron . 
  salty ? 
  ha , im delighted , we won the referendum . 
  7 years , reduced to 3 , how are we not ? 
  same website as the post article dumbo, 
  thanks nicole , now back to the studio, 
  there were experts and qualified individualises on both sides , turns out the remainers experts were wrong . 
  no they did n't , 2019-20 was their prediction [ source from the same website as this article published before the vote to leave ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/b8441622-1a6a-11e5-8201-cbdb03d71480 ), 
  before the vote to leave , donald tusk said it would take 7 years to leave . 
  wto said 10 years . 
  so we 're way ahead of schedule . 
  we 're still waiting for the immediate recession those experts warned of . 
  currently the uk is languishing at 1.8 % growth rate compared to the eurozone 's mighty 0.3 % . 
  i 'm guessing we 'll just buy them off all the unemployed danish , dutch , belgian , french fishermen that go bankrupt once they ca n't fish in uk waters . 
  and austrilasia , americas like we did before joining, 
  the public certainly were n't the biggest advocates at all , it was the government . 
  the report said the attackers were of mixed ethnicity . 
  no , not confirmed , they said reports of 100 incidents . 
  phwoah, 
  you suck at cheese, 
   well , half of the populace ( maybe even more than half by the time it comes about ) does n't want brexit to happen what ? 
  no , otherwise remain would have won the referendum, 
  he - higher education hea - higher education authority qaa - quality assurance agency ( for higher education ) ni - national insurance,
