that was exactly my point . 
  the eiffel tower is a symbol of france , not europe , big ben is the uk not europe , brandenberg gate again the same, 
  we 're not a single country , so it 's not exactly like you can say that there is an answer . 
  the closest would be saying the european houses of parliament in brussels . 
  it 'd be like saying the taj mahal is the symbol of the whole of asia , or the pyramids are the symbol of africa, 
  no , i know it does to be competitive but the cost of changing that diet is n't as extreme and you can show you are at least competent to get funding ( if you 're going pro ) , weight lifting ... not so much, 
  to run fast does n't require completely changing your physique . 
  to be able to lift like this means you need to change your entire diet and be lifting a ton ( well probably more ), 
  if your population is 330,000 that means you have two miss world winners, 
  200 malboro 's runs you about $ 25 , i think i would save money going out there , buying a load of cigarettes and coming back . 
  i was looking earlier in the year and it tends to be about # 70 for ryan air flights , but it 's also ridiculously cheap out there , so you save money on that . 
  tobacco is also tax-free so perhaps you get lots of people going there for that . 
  there 's a difference between the western allies declaring war over poland to stop hitler 's expansion into europe and the western allies actually caring about poland itself, 
  wow , that was probably the longest thing i 've read on reddit , but really interesting, 
  100 hours , pfft casual, 
  i 've not met a single french person who agrees with hollandes tax policies, 
  i was thinking more of the people than the city i guess, 
  southern * fairy * actually , and london 's hated on by lots of people , as are so many places , cornwall , wales in general , cambridge , and as i said the other places . 
  but i 've heard more hate for liverpool / newcastle and birmingham than other cities , but that could be because i 'm from the south, 
  england has a couple , birmingham newcastle and liverpool . 
  but we make fun of everywhere , it 's difficult to pick where you dislike most, 
  true but only for about 2 weeks a year . 
  the rest is all rain, 
  at least people i know do n't really have a term for it . 
  i know indian summer is said amongst some people in the uk , but i do n't hear it often personally, 
  eh i have n't heard it all that much , especially amongst people my age despite living here all my live . 
  to be fair indian summer is n't used that commonly in the uk, 
  reminds me of the champions league logo http://www.nscaa.com/uploads/uefa-champions-league-logo-32482.jpg, 
  we had two golden eras in most people 's opinion . 
  under elizabeth i and james i , so late 16th / early 17th century , and obviously the british empire 's growth in the 19th century . 
  surveying churches would actually make the survey absolutely useless . 
  as would doing the survey on sunday at 10am . 
  i could n't see the actual figures , but if 500 people under 28 were surveyed at different times of day / week then the survey is legitimate , regardless of it 's results . 
  surveying churches in particular would give you a skewed result as it would make the survey not random , but focused . 
  i would n't , 30s too hot for me , i am ginger after all, 
  argentina were n't exactly beaten decisively , and a lot can change in 4 years . 
  however i would say that 2018 will favour european teams , not sure about 2022 yet, 
  and 22 in the uk right now . 
  britain we are allowed to moan about our nation , you however are not also these new eastern europeans are stealing the jobs of respectable pakistanis and indians stole in the 70s from irish who stole em in the 50s, 
   germoney honestly that about sums it up, 
  the monarchy would exist regardless , belgium , spain etc exist with a monarch , european monarchs simply do n't have real role in the nation anymore, 
  and your proof of this is ? 
  you have made massive sweeping statements all along this thread , the only country that has benefited heavily from the euro is germany . 
  now the uk might well be similar , but out of 18 nations , one has done well , that 's not a very good success rate , and germany have been forced to bail out many southern european nations to save the euro . 
  to me this seems like a bad trade when sterling is doing actually very well right now against both dollar ( 1.7 ) and the euro ( 1.25 ) , the highest both have been in a long while . 
  however , we were able to set our own monetary policy when it came to the 2008 recession , whether we did it well or not . 
  it was under our control . 
  whilst we would have a big say if we ever joined the euro ( on the same level as france and germany ) , national sovereignty is very important to britain , moreso than most nations in the eu due to our history , probably only france come close . 
  and secondly , because the pound is strong . 
  it 's the third or fourth most traded currency , and probably the most stable too . 
  probably the biggest problem is that the euro us weaker than the pound ( # 1  $ 1 ) , this was n't a problem for most , if any european countries , but for the uk it 's likely we 'd see bigger repercussions than other nations . 
  the last point though is simply why ? 
  what reason is there to change ? 
  hell why not the great western fourth reich, 
  i 'm an arsenal supporter so it had to be the arsenal newcastle game , but the liverpool cl final is definitely up there, 
  i do n't think you were playing badly enough to deserve to lose in the first half , but yeah your second half performance was probably the second best second half performance i 've ever seen, 
   we did n't play well against spain , and we played even worse against australia . 
  fair enough , australia played well . 
  but you were on fire against spain . 
  spain have only really just begun to dominate in football , but winning 2 euros in a row with the world cup in the middle is a massive deal . 
  you still have an incredibly strong line up even if you discount everyone over like 26, 
  it would also open up the possibility of other countries leaving the union , a domino effect if you like . 
  i know france , spain and italy are n't the happiest countries in the union , if they start leaving then it could very well be the end, 
  and i 'm pretty sure that gchq were just as up for it as the nsa, 
  10 downing street have been denying , it playing it down right now , but it 's more than a rumour in my opinion, 
  ** united kingdom ** ** politics ** [ ed miliband proposes to renationalise the railways ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/03/rail-state-control-ed-miliband ) , this is more a grab for attention than anything else in my opinion , the contracts are up for renewal in the next few years , and instead of giving them to private companies miliband proposes to keep them in the governments hands , has n't said much about decreasing any rail fares etc so i ca n't see much good happening . 
  [ possiblity for a debate between ukip leader nigel farage and pm david cameron ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27274622 ) - similar to farage 's debate with clegg a month or so ago , where farage came out on top in most people 's estimates . 
  it 'd be interesting to see how farage comes out against what most people think will be his biggest rival in 2015 . 
  ( the conservative party ) [ yougov polls suggest the scottish referendum is getting closer ] ( http://www.channel4.com/news/scotland-independence-85-per-cent-no-vote-poll-exclusive ) , 58 % no , 42 % yes .

  how many websites do you visit that do n't have an english option ? 
  there are some foreign language films , but they almost always have english subs , and at that point you barely listen to the dialogue itself anyway , tv wise there 's very little foreign tv that seems to have popularity in english speaking countries apart from perhaps japanese anime . 
   in fact , i kind of wish they would have started with the third language in 2nd or 3rd grade as well . 
  that 's what a lot of people say in england about learning german or french , we have it the same as you starting them at year 5 or 6 usually . 
  except we have n't already learnt a language, 
  ukraine is almost the same size as texas ... lousiana is a 1/6th of the size . 
  i prefer maps that let you do it your own way , then you can at least get all the ones you know out of the way, 
   otherwise the great firewall of cameron would become illegal . 
  and that 's not only a massive oversimplification , it 's an outright lie . 
  there was an optional porn filter put onto new internet connections , this can be disabled very easily by the account holder , in my case it was as easy as using the account settings online . 
  it 's also not a new thing , mobile data has used it ( especially o2 ) since 3g became popular . 
  is this really that surprising though ? 
  many countries have completely changed the language spoken , england has n't always spoken english , italy has n't always spoken italian etc etc, 
  never been there so i ca n't comment but u know biking tends to be either very popular or completely not, 
  it could just man that people did n't put it as their * main * form of transport . 
  cyprus and malta do n't really have a large hubs so perhaps bikes are less useful, 
  very few outside london ( and cambridge for some reason ) though, 
  the city of london is not separate to the uk , the uk is a sovereign nation , the eu on the other hand is not and therefore the sovereignty of it 's member states should be respected, 
  the united kingdom is a sovereign state , the eu is not . 
  no , i want a union that respects the sovereignty of its nation states. , the eu has massively increased its power since we originally voted for , i think we should be able to re discuss that arrangement, 
  for me , it would be an opt-out . 
  not out entirely , but allow countries to have more choice in implementing policies on the condition that these countries have other pieces of legislation dealing with it . 
  the eu does a good job in regulating smaller countries that perhaps do n't have certain policies and the like but for more powerful nations that do n't perhaps have the same ideology as the eu they should n't be forced into certain agreements and treaties . 
  one big example would be on free immigration , whilst i do n't dislike immigration to the extent that many do ( especially in the uk ) there are problems with free movement of people when you have lots of nations that are n't equal . 
  having free immigration between say , italy , spain , the uk , france and germany is fine .
