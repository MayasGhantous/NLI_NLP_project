  any job that needs a lot of travel can also get these breaks ( if you end up living abroad for over 4 months a year i think , i could be wrong on the figures ) , those travellers are therefore part time house owners . 
  council tax in the uk is meant to reflect how much you use the services , not how much you earn, 
  pay less council tax , it 's very little in the grand scheme of things but the reason they pay less is because they live there part time put it this way , a family living in a house full time will use more services than someone living there part time , despite what they earn in reality , why should someone who does n't use the binmen , does n't use roads or police need to pay as much council tax another point in this is simply that the less well off tend to simply not take advantage of many discounts and tax breaks given . 
  that 's not the rich 's fault , that 's everyone else 's . 
  for instance if you live by yourself you 're eligible for up to 25 % off council tax again the example given in the article gives the sultan of brunei as an example against the braithwaite family . 
  the braithwaite family has 3 generations living in their house , no matter how much they earn , they use at * least * three times the services of the sultan, 
  i 'm not sure if you 're british , but it 's pretty much a constant that people complain about the rich not paying enough tax in all honesty , it 's refreshing to see someone come out and say something against it, 
  he 's not talking about cutting tax there , he 's talking about * everyone * blaming the rich people are always moaning that the rich are n't paying enough tax , that 's what boris johnson was talking about, 
  it 's a very minor point in the entire article , there 's literally a sentence dedicated to it  indeed , it is possible , as the american economist art laffer pointed out , that they might contribute even more if we cut their rates of tax ; he said he possibly agrees with an economist that the rich may contribute more if we cut taxes . 
  he 's talking about taxes , he 's saying that we should be thanking the rich for the taxes they pay later on he mentions the figure that the top 1 % pay 29.8 % of the taxes and the top 0.1 % ( 24,000 people ) pay 14.1 % of taxes , plus the rich donate the most to charity it 's not the best quote , but it is boris johnson so what can you expect . 
  i do n't think it 's that bad honestly , boris johnson is giving his opinion of the super rich and how they benefit the country . 
  denmark 's closer to other nordic countries , the netherlands is a benelux country . 
  they 're as similar as italy is to tunisia, 
  maybe not , but iran , china or russia might . 
  at any rate , the social contract theory gives up your rights to your ** own ** nation , not any others . 
  if other countries are spying on me , then it 's a violation of my nations sovereignty . 
  whilst it 's hypocritical yes , i do n't think it 's unreasonable to want to be the best , rather than simply average . 
  people inside your country can cause just as much damage , so i personally have no qualms with my government spying on myself or anyone else in the uk or abroad . 
  i 'd like to think they do as much as possible to stop other nations spying on us however . 
  it 's not really a left / right divide in the uk . 
  not at all . 
  many of these measures were implemented under labour , and many labour supporters do n't have a problem with it . 
  it 's because unlike the us , liberalism is n't tied to a left or right divide , it 's sort of left to the lib dems , although as the article mentioned this showed they do n't especially care all that much either . 
   good point . 
  texas is free to leave the us too , iirc well , the civil war pretty much sorted that question out . 
  ( in case you did n't know , the north did n't let the southern states leave peacefully ), 
  sovereignty . 
  a sovereign nation could choose * not * to be part of the eu if it wanted to , it could decide to focus on oil and drilling or education , it could become a neutral country like switzerland etc. 
  people see being tied to other countries as very different things . 
  i mean new zealand 's * basically * a state of australia right ? 
  i do n't know , my uncle used to run a small shop and he used to go abroad and buy lots of cheap fags and sell them at a reduced price to friends etc. 
  might be what your mate does, 
  i do n't think i 've seen chesterfields sold in a long time . 
  but they must be dodgy ones , the tax alone should put them at more than that, 
  the uk economy is expected to grow more next year than it has since 2008 , and you think it 's going to default ? 
  if it was going to default it would have done by now . 
  depends on the brand , pall mall 's are # 6 but i 've paid # 9.60 for a pack of camels before, 
   barring basque , which is an isolate seriously , basque is fucking weird, 
  they were mainly in wales and scotland but who * did n't * find it easy to beat the welsh & scottish, 
  cissoko had a bad match , but i think coutinho was even worse when he came on , did he manage to complete a single pass into a good area ? 
  no , but once the whistle went you saw szczesny and koscielny just stop . 
  i 'm not convinced it would have been a goal had advantage been given . 
  we scored 2 anyway , so suck it, 
  sometimes the british media just latches onto certain news stories , madeleine mccan springs to mind but plebgate too, 
  i guess i 'm a bit biased but even so, 
  ** united kingdom ** * storm st jude hit england pretty hard , a large majority of trains were shut down , with only really south-eastern lines running from london . 
  in wales there were powercuts across the country as well . 
  * gcse overhaul is now confirmed . 
  gcse 's are england 's standard tests given to 16 year olds , they 're now to use numbers , rather than letters for grades and coursework is for the most part scrapped . 
  this will start being taught in 2015 . 
  * `` plebgate '' continues , with officers who lied about what andrew mitchell said being investigated by a police watchdog . 
  * economically , we are finally looking like we have sustained growth , an estimated growth of 1.4 % this year , up from estimates of 1.2 % ( and 2.4 % estimated next year ) * ed miliband questioned over the investigation into the rigging of falkirk ( labour won the electoral seat ) by unions . 
  he 's refusing to publish the report right now * linda hogan is being tipped towards becoming the first female cardinal , which is pretty big news in the catholic world , it could see the debate about female bishops being started up again * england beat australia in the rugby , 20-13 * just for me , arsenal are now 5 points clear at the top of the premier league, 
  costa rica , dominican republic , puerto rico , haiti etc, 
  if she 's still alive she 'll look completely different now anyway and she was taken young enough that she may not even realise she was kidnapped after enough time what annoyed me was the fact that the press focused on the madeleine mccann angle , and almost bypassed the fact the couple with the mccann lookalike had claimed 14 children as their own , 10 of which are missing , and apparently had 6 children in less than 10 months, 
  i do n't know anyone who still cares about the story , if they have n't found her yet by plastering her face over news networks for weeks on weeks they 're not going to what 6 years later now ( i had no idea it was that long ago , 2007 she went missing ! ), 
  ** united kingdom ** * [ blackmarket organ market exposed ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10390183/girl-smuggled-into-britain-to-have-her-organs-harvested.html ) , a girl was smuggled into the country to have her organs harvested , an estimated 350 other children / slaves have been smuggled in for the same purpose * [ bloody sunday murderers facing arrest ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/10391807/bloody-sunday-soldiers-could-face-arrest-for-murder.html ) , 26 unarmed civil rights protesters in derry , northern ireland were shot by the soldiers of the british army in 1972 , 13 died .

  this time , in greece . 
  [ article ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/10391797/farsala-roma-community-maria-was-well-looked-after.html ) changed 3rd link, 
  i would n't count germany because they 've only been unified for 140 years or so you could count the germanic people , but that could then include much of england from anglo-saxon migration etc. 
  oh okay , fair enough . 
  the main place i see austria is the alps , so i would n't be surprised if they 're much less regulated up there, 
  i would kill for $ 5.75 marlboro 's , they run about # 8.50 ( $ 10.1 ) in the uk, 
  from what i 've seen there 's a definite smoking culture in austria , they seem to just ignore any anti-smoking laws from the eu germany however push anti-smoking laws on a fairly regular basis, 
  the uk is n't exactly low , and i think has some of the most expensive cigarettes in europe , in fact according to [ this ] ( http://www.cigaretteprices.net/ ) site only norway ( not shown here ) and ireland have higher prices on cigarettes, 
  huh , the us only has 19 % of the population that smoke . 
  i guess that sort of explains why so much of reddit hates smokers with a passion , i 've never seen anyone more vehement against smokers than on reddit , certainly not in the uk . 
  i 'm fairly sure there 's no law in austria regarding smoking inside , at least from what i 've seen . 
  maybe it 's just because everyone ignores it, 
  no , it 's really not . 
  you 're just being ridiculous now . 
  and most train platforms and outdoor restaurants have smoking banned . 
  outdoor restaurants at any rate will at worst have a non-smoking area , and a smoking area . 
  train stations are usually non-smoking , at least in the uk , also they tend to be quite long , and there 's never dozens of them all along the same platform, 
  no , my argument is that there is always something harmful in the air , whether it 's exhaust fumes , cigarette smoke or smog . 
  i do n't understand why if in an open area people want to smoke it 's a bad thing . 
  it does n't affect you to walk past somebody that smokes , it might smell a bit , but so might somebody who has n't washed in 3 days . 
  the tiny tiny amount of secondhand smoke you get when outside has been proven to have a negligible effect if any , let alone enough to cause any lasting harm . 
  i can understand not smoking in an enclosed area , but in an open space ? 
  you can either walk around the person or just go straight past them , you do n't need to follow them around close enough for it to be an inconvenience to you . 
  but public transport is much better for society , on an environmental and economical level . 
  cigarettes cause others harm , but so do cars . 
  yes cars have a benefit , but if i 'm a pedestrian i 'm still inhaling toxic fumes . 
  if i want to smoke outside , i should be able to , if i want to drive a petrol car that does 3mpg then i should be able to . 
  car exhaust fumes are just as likely to give you cancer as secondhand smoke * when you 're outside * . 
  it 's simply not harmful , banning a substance like tobacco for reasons like this is simply ridiculous . 
  to me , the kids are way more annoying than people smoking outside . 
  i do n't understand why you need to do either , it 's not your right to be perfectly happy , you need to respect other people and how they want to live . 
  i might not especially like kids playing outside as they 're loud as shit but that does n't mean i will try to stop them doing it . 
  smoking is the same, 
  smokers easily pay what they take in healthcare costs in taxes . 
  cigarettes are one of the most heavily taxed products in most countries right now , they easily make up the healthcare costs . 
  i 'm perfectly okay paying more healthcare costs relating to smoke related diseases * if * you remove the taxes on cigarettes , you can not have both, 
  then live in the middle of nowhere if you do n't want anything . 
  anything in urban areas can be harmful , smoke from cooking food , car exhaust fumes etc. 
  i like smoking , it 's something i enjoy , and if i do it outside it causes very minimal harm to anyone . 
  if i drive a lot , i 'm probably causing more harm than smoking outside so why ban it ? 
  sure , but what about screaming kids .
