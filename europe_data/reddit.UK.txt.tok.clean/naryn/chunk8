  brown never even won an election . 
  he was n't especially well liked and probably for good reason , there 's a reason i did n't include him and it was because he well , did n't do much . 
  i 'd argue that major is more the forgotten man . 
  john major managed to win 2 successive elections which before thatcher had n't been done by anyone since macmillan iirc . 
  macmillan , thatcher , major and blair are the only 4 prime ministers to have won 2 successive elections since wwii yet major is pretty much forgotten about completely . 
  ( cameron won 2 but not by a majority ), 
  honestly , i will admit i 'm thinking as a political graduate first and an average citizen second . 
  however the creation of the third way and the first ever peacetime coalitions are pretty damn big things in general anyway . 
  sturgeon will be remembered * should * scotland go independent , if they do n't then i do n't think she will , but as i said it 's dependent on future events rather than events that have already happened . 
  same goes for boris . 
  is russia not western ? 
  sure but eisenhower was 60 years ago , and also i never said every politician was useless , but that there were a lot of useless politicians back then too . 
  you just do n't remember them because of that . 
  de gaulle was great for france , but i would say for instance putin is an exception if we 're looking at european leaders . 
  yes , he 's not a `` good '' leader but he is a great leader for russia , he has been the strongest russian leader arguably since stalin . 
  even if you do n't like him , he 's still been incredibly effective . 
  mandela has only just died , and he was another one i would argue for . 
  daniel inouye was a us senator from hawaii and a great politician in the us , might not be the most well known but extremely good before his death in 2012, 
  from the uk ; blair ( i 'd still call him modern ) , he completely changed the labour party and was the first successful labour leader in decades . 
  cameron and clegg , first non-wartime coalition in british politics is a pretty big step , even if coalitions become the norm in the future . 
  apart from that ? 
  * possibly * nicola sturgeon if scotland do become independent and maybe boris johnson should the uk leave the eu . 
  it 's not like politicians 50 years ago were any better , callaghan and heath are both regarded as failures , so are carter and ford in the us , and nixon 's not exactly remembered fondly . 
  not really , it 's just giving a relatively fair estimation of how long it takes . 
  ukraine needs significant restructuring before it should become part of the eu , turkey has been waiting for longer and will still probably be waiting because it 's simply not there yet . 
  to be fair he is polish , they have more grievances against communism than most countries, 
  it 's british humour , people are more like this in most atmospheres . 
  most people go around saying politicians are n't relatable at all or anything and this shows that honestly they are, 
  strong leader is pushing it but certainly better than the rest of the pack, 
  middle school is n't that popular , the uk essentially does n't have one either . 
  although if you want to be specific about it we have four tiers, 
  europhile is probably better . 
  is n't the term europhile ? 
   personally , i 'd leave it up to the northern irish . 
  i think that 's the attitude of most british people , but the ni do want to remain so, 
  for some reason i just thought of taylor swift 's `` we are never ever getting back together '' song when you said that about turkey . 
  did n't the most recent polls show turks do n't * want * to become part of the eu anyway ? 
   i think a majority or a near majority of british people would like to hand northern ireland over to southern ireland really since when ? 
  we gave a referendum to northern ireland and they rejected independence and/or joining the republic of ireland . 
  i do n't know why anyone would want to forcefully give northern ireland away, 
  in this case though , these people are n't moving out of choice but out of necessity . 
  if for instance israel became as dangerous as syria to live in and you were a gay jew who needed to flee the country then you would n't have much choice outside of saudi arabia and other middle eastern countries . 
   again , in my opinion marriage assumes there 's sexual intercourse between the couple , and if it involves a minor , it 's a crime . 
  end of story . 
  and i 'm not saying that the marriage should continue if the couple move to a country where it 's illegal . 
  however , the actions of the husband when he was in a country where it * is * legal should n't mean that he should be deported , especially when children are involved . 
   having sex with children is child abuse . 
  but it * is n't * . 
  not where these marriages are happening . 
  i 'm not arguing that the 20 year old should be allowed to stay married to a 12 year old , i 'm arguing that a 20 year old should n't be deported for doing something that was not a crime in his own country . 
  and stopping a father from seeing his kids when he ** did n't ** rape her , but legally married her is wrong . 
  what happens if the husband is 15 though ? 
  and if they have children ? 
  yes , it 's considered morally wrong in our society to have sex with 12-13 year olds , but the fact of the matter is that it did happen . 
  and the fact they 're now here does n't mean that the husband can not love his children or his wife , even if she is younger than him . 
  i do n't disagree that they should be separated if the wife is that young , however i do n't think the husbands who were just as likely pressured into the marriage should be simply sent home without a second thought . 
  they are different laws , they are to prevent someone leaving the country specifically for that purpose . 
  they do not apply to someone who lived in that country then moved to a different one on a permanent basis ( whether as an immigrant or an asylum seeker ), 
  not at all . 
  you can not charge a person for doing acts in a country where the act was perfectly legal . 
  if i have sex with a 16 year old in britain then we move to california ( and do not have sex ) i can not be prosecuted for the statutory rape i `` committed '' in the uk despite me having committed the act . 
  okay put it this way . 
  the age of marriage in andorra is as low as 14 with judicial consent . 
  a married couple of say 14 and 18 who are legally married within a european state move to france where the marriage age is 18 . 
  should they be forceably split up because andorra recognises their marriage but france does not ? 
  in your opinion they should . 
  however , say a gay couple marry in ireland where it 's perfectly legal to do so , then they move to indonesia where simply * being * homosexual is illegal . 
  should this couple simply split up because they 're respecting the laws of the country they 're moving to ? 
  do you speak french , german or spanish ? 
  afaik lots of universities are taught in english but i know french unis are n't nor are most german or spanish ones so you need to check what language you 're going to be taught in if you 're going to a european country uk universities often offer grants for masters degrees but i do n't think non eu citizens count , the fees are about # 12-15000 a year i think but masters may be more expensive other countries despite having free or very cheap tuition do have higher fees for non eu citizens although that 's all based on the university and country itself . 
  the netherlands , belgium , finland , norway and denmark all teach in english i think but again make sure you check . 
  there 's not loads but a sizeable amount of american students so you 'll fit in fine, 
  i found international students ( never remembered which were here for their entire degree and which were erasmus ) definitely drank less than most local students then again brits are known for binge drinking, 
  is n't that just university ? 
  no , the idea of a common law means that you alter laws through challenging them in court whether that party is the british government challenging or john smith from next door, 
  majority of seats which is still a majority, 
  any power that parliament has given away it can take back , that 's very much * not * a separation of powers . 
  we have no consitution to enshrine the concept nor should we have . 
   history is replete with examples that show your faith to be laughably naieve . 
  just because it works now , does n't mean it always will . 
  this argument does n't work with established democracies . 
  britain has never had a constitution , the closest that it comes to one is the magna carta which was written in the 13th century and has n't been applicaple in the last couple of centuries . 
  yes , britain could fall to totalitarianism but so could any country by that argument . 
  no british monarch has attempted to rule in an absolutist fashion since charles i and that was prevented by parliament and did n't especially end well for him . 
  i do n't think it 's naive at all to think this trend would continue . 
  the people 's power comes from their decision at the voting booth as well as non-voting forms of political action . 
  it does n't need to be protected by a constitution because it 's protected by tradition and common law . 
  it 's final check is from the people themselves . 
   anyway , the parliament ratified it . 
  backpedaling just shows that the uk is untrustworthy when signing international treaties . 
  we ratified it but seeing as it has n't been challenged in court until today we have n't had to argue about the specifics of the bill . 
  this argument seems disingenuous to me , parliament can not be out of control , it * is * the control . 
  britain has been built on parliament being a bastion of control keeping the monarchs power in check , as well as providing representation for the population . 
  i have no fear of parliament becoming totalitarian like many americans do , parliament 's sovereignty is taken directly from the mandate it is given by the people , it can not therefore be abused because if it is , they have already lost the mandate . 
  exactly , so we can contravene it too . 
  we do n't have a separation of powers in the uk and whilst the judicial system should be able to limit the powers of parliament to a certain degree , parliament should be able to overturn decisions if found agreeable by a majority . 
  i do n't especially agree with anything that contravenes parliamentary sovereignty to be honest . 
  we have accepted the echr and even enshrined it into law but that does n't mean we have to bend over backwards to accommodate it . 
   this is clearly the latter case and the uk is actually pretty fucking terrible when it comes to family reunification visas . 
  we do n't ** want ** to have family reunification though because it 's a never ending chain of uncontrolled migration which is exactly what you do n't want .
