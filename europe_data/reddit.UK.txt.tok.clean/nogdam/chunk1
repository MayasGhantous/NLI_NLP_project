  well its got a lot of independent shops , restaurants and pubs , lots of writers live there , 60 % of the population work in the service sector ( i 'm not suggesting that 's necessarily a good thing ) , they pioneered things like `` transition towns '' , farmers markets and the lewes pound to keep money in the town for indi retailers ( bristol recently copied this ) .
