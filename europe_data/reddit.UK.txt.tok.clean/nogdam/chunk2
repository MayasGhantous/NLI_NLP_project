  the problem is that rainwater drains usually flow into the same pipes as domestic sewage in the uk , so our sewage system ( which was built when discharging into the sea was acceptable ) is easily overwhelmed . 
  still that 's a bit nicer than the fountains of shit you can get when it really rains hard !, 
  it happens when there has been too much rain for our sewers to handle , but i doubt that 's the case here .

  well either way its going to be fun election . 
  does n't northern ireland need 60 % support for joining the republic as part of good friday ? 
  i ca n't see that happening , especially since a `` northern irish identity '' is beginning to be a thing . 
  not sure i agree totally with your general election analysis in the event of a no vote . 
  i think the lib dems vote may hold up better than expected ( they are already going for policies their supporters find attractive like english devolutions and drug liberalisation ) , and the ukip factor could cause big splits in the working class tory vote causing some 2010 gained tory seats to fall back to labour . 
  i think we will see a narrow labour victory with scottish seats winning it .

  wooo cornwall !, 
  was n't there only about 6 votes in it in falmouth 2010 , i somehow doubt the tory votes will grow in cornwall next year ( unless the second home owners are in town ! ), 
  so there could be ld gains , do n't they still want a cornish assembly ? 
  that could be achievable post referendum . 
  i 'm in a safe tory ( 50 % ! ), 
  seat with lib dems a strong second ( 30 % ) , i long for it to be closer , we are ignored by our mp who only speaks in the commons about twice a year . 
  the third party plays an important roll ( with fptp ) in proposing non populist policies , without the lib dems you would n't have people pushing for things like political and drugs reform . 
  ** united kingdom ** [ in a nutshell ; cities \\ ( especially in north \\ ) labour , rural areas and small towns conservative , in remote areas the liberal democrats tend to do well .

  i recently read an article which said the uk had about 33 % support for leaving ( about the same as ukips vote eh !, 
  ) , whereas about 55 % of french people wanted the uk to leave . 
  i 'm confident we would vote to stay in , i think it would be good to have a referendum around 2020 we might just get rid of farrage !,
