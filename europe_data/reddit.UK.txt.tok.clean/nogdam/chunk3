  i ca n't really word an answer to that right now , but i 'll think about it and try and get back to you . 
  these headlines are about `` saving the union '' not `` saving scotland '' , a break up of the uk would be as much a loss for english/welsh/ni / cornish unionists as it would be for the scottish ones . 
  i do n't own scotland i 'm british , i have scottish , welsh and english ( admittedly mostly ) ancestors , therefore i 'm a product of the united kingdom so that 's why it worries me . 
  i 'm all for scotland determining its own governance but in the same way that i believe my own region ( east anglia ) should be able to govern its self . 
  what you are seeing is a result of london becoming too remote its not england `` owning '' scotland . 
  do n't go there !, 
  well if like me you identify as british rather than english it is something worth saving . 
  no thanks !,

  yep , english supermarkets have meat labelled `` british '' , welsh ones `` welsh '' and scottish ones `` scottish '' . 
  people like to sneer at the bad welfare standards in france ( foie gras & veil crates ) and indoor reared danish pork . 
  we would probably say swedish standards are too low because too much of your livestock is kept indoors .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_day ) i think it used to be celebrated when it was 'em pire day ' .

  naaaaa . 
  many different models though , more likely its a signals surveillance version or something . 
  not to mention the war zone , things were n't much different here , blackouts , strikes , job losses , just we did have a sexual revolution . 
  and there 's lord haw-haw ( william joyce ) .

  the pembrokeshire coast kinda deserves it , seeing as its basically cornwall with half the tourists . 
  well it should be natural/cultural if it is n't . 
  however its not really a true spit because it formed along a glacial moraine . 
  and for that reason we are able to call these peoples actions barbaric . 
  if you remove citizenship then they might just carry on fucking up other peoples lives around the world , at least if they come back they can go through justice . 
  rather than roaming free in sub-saharan africa or whatever creating another humanitarian crisis for the west to sort out .

  do n't forget people on/towards the far right , nigel farrage has said a few pro-russian things , some unionists in northern ireland are pro-putin ( because gays ) and also some voices on the far left who somehow still think russia = communism . 
  these are just idiots drawn in by a cult , in the uk most communities are well integrated . 
  the problem is often with `` white flight '' in inner cities , when you have people segregated into different areas and learning in different schools depending on their religion things can only end badly .

  ben macdui ( the second highest ) is fun , there 's a camp-ground halfway along the trail , so you can make more of an event of it . 
  how common is it to summit the highest point of your country ? 
  i 've done ben nevis , a lot of people will if they ever visit scotland . 
  i study in leeds ( a provincial city in the north of england ) , everything i need is within cycling/walking distance a car would be an unnecessary expense ( plus the city has a big congestion problem ) , i like to cycle but there are very few cycle paths/lanes here compared to continental cities . 
  i can get home to my parents on the train in about 3.5 hours and anywhere else in the country is easily reachable by train ( or sometimes coach ) . 
  buses in the uk ( except in london ) are not regulated , anyone can set a route wherever they want and charge what they like , consequently buses in leeds are more expensive than continental cities ( even london ) so i do n't tend to use them , its cheaper to share a taxi with three/four people if you 're going out so i tend to do that . 
  leeds has a big pollution problem the volume of buses in the centre can make it quite an unpleasant place to be , for that reason the local transport authority want to put in a few trolleybus lines but the bus company is worried it will break its monopoly so are fiercely campaigning against it . 
  i choose to commute because the area i live in is where students tend to live so i 'm close to friends . 
   [ in fact , the fly ash emitted by a power plant -- a by-product from burning coal for electricity -- carries into the surrounding environment 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant producing the same amount of energy . 
  ] ( http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/ ) not saying nuclear is the solution , but i would prefer if it were used over coal ( as soon as the uk sorts out a long term waste storage site ) . 
  energy independence , france quite rightly decided to move away from coal but does n't have significant gas fields . 
  i guess when they were planning they did n't predict the plateau in demand as things became more energy efficient , so they are left with spare capacity , that 's good for the uk because we have n't planned our supply for 30 odd years so are constantly importing from france .

  its widely accepted that he saw mayor of london as a step in his political career , he says that he wo n't take a ministry position until his term as mayor ends , but then he will defiantly become a minister or , depending on the election , likely stand for leadership of the conservative party . 
  ( ken livingstone was also both mayor and an mp for a little while ), 
  i know that if finland were to join nato you would do it with sweden , so would sweden be more likely to assist finland in its defence ( to ultimately defend sweden ) unlike what happened in the winter war ?
