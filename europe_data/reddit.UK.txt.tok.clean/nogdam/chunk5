  could we make a bot that posts this image every time an american says some stupid shit ? 
  we have n't had conscription for about 50 years !, 
  but we still have child soldiers !, 
  ( you can join the army at 16 ) i think we are supposed to be increasing gender equality but right now very few women are able to fight on the front line alongside men . 
  it just went downhill from the beaker folk arriving . 
  i mean what 's wrong with cupping your hands ? 
  already being a part of norway never stopped us !, 
  what would the european and/or eu average work out at ? 
  what 's that no-mans land between norway and russia ? 
  could i claim it ? 
  is that a sim only deal ? 
  there 's not many sim only deals in the uk which are more than about # 15 , seems like you do n't have a very competitive market !, 
  if i 'm in the eu for an extended time i just pick up a payg sim and pay the max eu prices ( which are usually a lot less than using payg domestically ) and turn off internet roaming . 
  i have n't seen any deals in the uk yet , but then again unless you live in n.i , people do n't tend to go abroad outside holidays . 
  although they often try to get you to pay # 2/day to use your contract in the eu ( still seems expensive ) .

  how does a welshman find sheep in long grass ? 
  ( sorry just had to ), 
  and these people think they can govern themselves !, 
  very nice , be sure to visit st. agnes . 
  i just get get worried but they 'd think i thought they smelt bad or something . 
  why do n't you guys have toilets on coaches ? 
  ( do take a slash before getting on the bus to klaipeda ), 
  do you ever find yourself in the awkward situation when you take an isle seat and then the bus empties before you get off ? 
  i get such a massive urge to move but i also worry about offending the person i 'm sitting next to , when would a swede do ? 
  fuck , this is what the norfolk tourist board is missing !, 
  never eat the last biscuit !, 
  if you have too you should offer it to everyone else in the room , they should understand that you want it and will politely decline , then you may eat . 
  could have done with this a few months ago , i was in gdansk and some very friendly russians insisted they give me a lift despite my massive bicycle and telling them i was ** cycling ** across poland , managed to give them the slip when they were hungover , 
  the germans switched their migs for british/deutsch tornadoes did n't they ? 
  but areas with the highest unemployment ( north-east england for example ) also tend to be the areas with the highest job creation in a recovery . 
  has the school leaving age finally changed ? 
  i know the fact it was 16 suppressed our rank for a while . 
  we could always make a `` molotov -- ribbentrop pact '' of it . 
  `` hammond-bildt '' carries a certain ring . 
  annex norway ? 
  i like your thinking . 
  greene king is having a bad time , once they were pretty much the only brewery ( of cask ale ) , there has been a massive revival of micro brewers , my [ county has at least 36 ] ( http://www.norwichcamra.org.uk/brew/brew.htm ) . 
  so no , i mean real ale from the brewery 10 km away . 
  ** real .

  i 'd rather jerusalem was used when we compete as england , god save the queen/king is just dull , at least jerusalem finishes on building a better future , i 'd rather run into a rugby match off the back of that .

  please come and lower the average age ( 46 ! ), 
  of my little town !, 
  i bought sparkling water in sweden by accident , stupid swedish . 
  latvia is the only ` eastern ' country i 've been to where the government recommends bottled water . 
  a good way to tell if people drink tap water or not is if you go into a supermarket and find a whole isle dedicated to bottled water . 
   and nationalisation wo n't fix this as politicians will still be in charge . 
  br worked the best at the end of the 80s/early 90s , politicians let them get on with there own thing , intercity and network southeast operated without any subsidy . 
  ironically privatisation bought more state intervention , who 's paying the # 4.5 bn for the new express trains , not the train companies but the government directly !, 
  safe too drink , but run by regional privatised monopolies , who do n't have the right to cut you off but do have the right to avoid paying tax , in wales and northern ireland i believe that water is still in state hands . 
  our geology varies a lot so water quality can vary wildly too . 
  water/sewage and electricity distribution ( not generation ) should be state run ( railways too but that aint a resource ) . 
  i though this was just a bit wired when i tried it , i think i 'll just stick to ice cream . 
  [ here 's another serbian film worth a watch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocw3fbqpqku ), 
   well of course , the baltic countries !, 
  i really like estonia and latvia , if not for different languages , we could be a single ass-kickin ' country . 
  and with you 're great musical heritage you could be ass-shakin ' too !, 
   danish medicinal giant novo nordisk is now larger than german volkswagen conglomerate , after 37 quarters with at least 10 % growth .

  ^ conspiracy !, 
  out of where i 've been , * sweden ( visited the most ) , music , rights you have for the outdoors ( and how people are trusted to be responsible ) , your social democracy and not having so much pressure to be successful . 
  i do n't like expensive alcohol and would n't fancy living in a small town though !, 
  * poland , everyone is so friendly !, 
  poland reminded me of home if i 'm honest , people tend to be a bit conservative , lots of history , not so much thought given to town planning !, 
  get your roads up to scratch and you 'll be a powerhouse !, 
  * lithuania , good food , great beer and a land of opportunity ( although 9 % + gdp grown is a bit over the top ) !, 
  * italy , food , wine , mountains , sea , need i say more ? 
  but honestly every country in europe i 've been to has had something to shout about .

  we have these heavily subsidised rural bus services , usually i 'd get one into town and ( unless its market day ) it would just be me and a couple of pensioners travelling for free . 
  still a bus , but you could get dropped at your doorstep , if you were nice to the driver .

  very hip , worthy of shoreditch . 
  pure speculation but i 've seen a 747f ( n412mc ) on plane finder heading towards brize norton from the east , certainly the kind of thing that could carry heavy equipment at short notice ... update : it did land . 
  also the frenzy the press is in right now would let any uk action pass almost unchallenged and benefit cameron in the run up to the election . 
  i reckon it would more likely be angelo-dutch , american boots on the ground would make russian propagandists wet in the pants . 
  did n't cameron have a long conversation with the dutch pm yesterday ?
