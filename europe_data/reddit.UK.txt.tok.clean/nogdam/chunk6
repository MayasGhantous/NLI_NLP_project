  sorry i hold similar views ( i 'm an environmental scientist !, 
  ) , the economy should be reformed so the value of the natural world ( monetary , social and environmental ) is expressed in world economics . 
  no , maybe just a jealous dane , 3.6 % ? 
   conveniently the crimea issue also makes ukraine ineligible to join well greece and turkey are still active members , i think it only depends on how much western leaders want to piss off putin . 
  looks like this was filmed with a super-8 camera from the 60s , were things that bad ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/crime/lietuvoje-zudoma-dazniau-nei-kitur-es-vilniuje-reciau-nei-rygoje.d?id=19885621 ) is the article used as reference on the lithuanian wikipedia article , but you still do better than russia !, 
  i hear they have the highest homicide rate in the eu !, 
  ( disclaimer : i cycled though and stayed in kaunas a few weeks ago , i really like lithuania , could certainly see myself living there ), 
  my plan is to stubbornly stay in sweden between casting my vote and any formal `` divorce '' , for that reason i 'll be looking for a swedish tuition if the tories are back next year . 
   fukken $ 1 million trams ... jeeez trying to outdo london 's $ 0.5 million buses ? 
  good point , this is europe , of coarse our politicians should be stylish !, 
  so that 's why the kippers insist on driving everywhere . 
  [ they would * never * sink this low . 
  he was only `` democratically '' elected by his own constituents . 
  remember how pro-europe we were after the channel tunnel ? 
  how about the eu buys us a channel bridge , kippers would love driving to france !, 
  oops , just fixed that, 
  two houses , the commons ( lower house ) and the lords ( upper house ) , ministers ( including the prime minister ) can come from either house . 
  the commons elects 650 mps who represent their constituency ( each with around 70,000 voters ) using first past the post . 
  the house of lords has 753 peers who are appointed by the government and 26 bishops , recently peers have been appointed based on the national share of the vote each party got in the last general election . 
  however you can not expel a lord which means the number of them has to keep growing to keep the proportions right , it also means that the lords is a sort of retirement home for old politicians , although it is illegal to die in the chamber . 
  reforms were proposed by the current government to make it elected , but these were blocked by the tories as own back for the lib dems blocking the tory proposed constituency size reforms which intern was own back for the tories non-support for voting reform of the commons . 
  debate in the lords is less passionate than the commons ( has the atmosphere of a gentlemen 's club ) and the commons does have a veto over it . 
  edit : got my upper and lower houses mixed up, 
  have some respect , they found space for the [ mighty river chet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/river_chet ) . 
  i do n't see norway , denmark , sweden , belgium or the netherlands being damaged by the fact they have a monarchy , no i do n't go waving union flags whenever prince charles is in my county and i do think all powers the queen has should be legally ceremonial . 
  but you only have to look what 's been going on in ukraine to see what can happen when you have a directly elected president , i say let them open schools and keep tories , school children and tacky merchandise sellers happy . 
   it 's ~ ~ not ~ ~ broken ~ ~ so ~ ~ we do n't want to pay to `` fix '' it . 
  ftfy, 
  i voted green with my postal vote , i expect they probably will get a seat in my region ( they only need a 1 % swing ) . 
  when i used vote match sites i got green about 4 out of 5 times ( the other 1 time would be lib dem ) , so i think i made the right choice , i also donated to their europe campaign . 
  almost everyone will have had some type of french lesson in school here . 
  not sure that counts as `` pop culture '' . 
  series three started on bbc four last night , very much a `` high culture '' channel ( although this is where all foreign language programs go ) . 
  edit : just saw that the english version was on bbc one ( i have n't seen much of it ) , so it could count . 
  i believe sweden is the worlds third largest music exporter after the us and uk . 
  i think it would be good for the industry if singing in english was n't so discouraged by some countries ( looking at you france ) to help end the usa 's monopoly . 
  is being gay legal over there yet ? 
  no labour is , the tories have the australian one who bought in a government with a `` lets tow boats of migrants back out to sea '' policy , makes you proud of the empire . 
  norfolk friend !, 
  according too clegg the lib dems want to keep the status quo , the greens want more democratic reforms in the eu ( but if your voting tactically you should look at how much support they get in your region ) , tories/labour do n't really have a clear cut policy on europe as far as i can tell . 
  you can look up who the first few candidates are on the list of under the party name , some conciliation, 
  he does n't want to split his party in two , that 's why the conservatives will never be able to see off ukip . 
  it 's up to the left to make the convincing case . 
  do you have to hide your papers under the duvet ? 
  awwww so they 're not going for the green vote this time round ? 
  the lib dems are very strong in the north and the shetlands though . 
  i love the irony in that the shetlands are so anti scottish independence , the `` who gets the oil '' punch up will be fun if they secede from scotland . 
  the green party only need 1 % more of the vote to get a seat , disillusioned core lib dem voters in places like norwich and cambridge might just be enough to get the extra 1 % . 
  if ukip 's hand was n't so tight around the lib-dems ' balls i 'm sure they would be pro schengen . 
  sometimes i long for pro-eu scotland to be part of england . 
  mainly because so many people split from ukip because their no longer a single issue party and set up there own . 
  in my region : ukip , conservatives , liberal democrats , labour and maybe the green party ( there 's also the possibility of the liberal democrats loosing their seat this time round . 
  [ here 's the previous results ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_of_england_%28european_parliament_constituency%29 ), 
  [ this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okghurkzixa ), 
  they did get some considerable help from the [ lend-lease program ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lend-lease ) , or should that be lend keep ? 
  ( let 's not forget this was a condition of stalin joining the allies ), 
  that pretty good , i ca n't even get 3g where i live , although i did just get a new record for my [ internet speed ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/3489430913.png ) ( yes i am aware i live in the sixth biggest economy in the world ) . 
  i remember reading a vice article that put the investment in romanian internet infrastructure down to web-cam `` modelling '' , is this opinion widely held romania ? 
  also congrats as well , looking at those photos posted earlier this week you would never have predicted a tech boom within a quarter of a century . 
  / r/trees !, 
  man they took the fun out of reddit . 
  i think your username suits the situation , thanks, 
  could it be a problem for russian redditers ? 
  at least you swedes actually have somewhere to put your waist , right now all of ours [ is in `` ponds '' ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/1008019/sellafield-nuclear-waste-storage-warning ) at a site with one of the worst nuclear safety records in the world . 
  we [ need one of these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pif4cty.jpg ) . 
  the uk had a socialist government after the war . 
  someone did this for my city norwich , targeted in the baedeker raids ( basically hitler decided to bomb the most beautiful english cities as listed in the german guide book of the same name , succeeding in some more than others [ note coventry ] ) . 
  [ flickr ] ( https://secure.flickr.com/photos/osborne_villas/sets/72157625836754972/ ), 
  well there are [ some downsides ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/hk_french_squat_toilet.jpg ), 
  the photos in this article no longer exist , funny that . 
  we all hate the french ( we wish we were in france and french ), 
  i thought the general consensus was that the current low price of gas in the us had lead to a smaller investment in renewables , for example they have n't seen solar farms spring up as we have in europe . 
  with my geology student hat on there 's no reason there should be any threat to the environment , providing current standards are followed and the land around the site is properly surveyed . 
  the only significant risk is if there are any unmapped bore holes which could lead to leakage of the fluids back towards the surface . 
  however exploiting it would undermine the push to for renewables , which is why i 'm sceptical . 
  i reckon it probably will happen on a large scale in this country but offshore with mobile drilling rigs ( and a larger public subsidy ) , that way they 'll get rid of the nimby crowd . 
  anyway this russia today clip gives a `` balanced view '' on the environmental risks of fracking complete with skull and crossbones . 
  http://youtu.be/nci_x7orrha?t=3m46s funnily enough when i first saw this on tv it was right before a film on the wonders of siberian gold mining ( they did n't seem to think it was important to mention the vast environmental damage of blowing up a mountain and extracting gold with acid ) . 
  would it be possible to get reddit to launch a voting awareness ad campaign ? 
  every little helps, 
  oh look [ this could be fun ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/28/ukip-european-election-accused-of-racism ) . 
  ( cross party campaign to brand ukip as racist ), 
  we 've had one ukip leaflet though the door , apart from that the `` cool part of town '' has a few green party posters outside houses/businesses and i saw one vote labour poster in the window of a tower block . 
  the media just seems to be treating it like an in/out referendum , just talking about ukip all the time . 
  worked out fine to be honest , commentators in right wing papers were calling for guardian journalists to be put in gaol , probably because of the guardian exposing phone hacking/malpractice in the media . 
  ah yes the whole `` you 've had enough debate , now give us your hard-dives '' . 
  [ guardian video ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/jan/31/snowden-files-computer-destroyed-guardian-gchq-basement-video ), 
  the thing is the first thing to go from a uk exit would be freedom of movement . 
  i had work experience at a uk office of a dutch business involved in the oil and gas industry ( not shell ) , they were heavily dependent freedom of movement , people would come in from poland & germany and head out to paris , the hague and norway often at less than a weeks notice . 
  yes they did sent people to the us but it was only worth arranging the right visas for a couple of people . 
  if suddenly they had to wait a month or so for a visa application to be processed for someone in the rome office it would just be impossible for the company to operate . 
  if you look at the north sea oil and gas industry as one example you 'll know that the amount left is steadily reducing , companies like bp and exxon are selling fields to start-ups with fine profit margins and a very mobile workforce , some of these would have to close . 
  this intern would destroy the economies of east coast towns like great yarmouth , humberside and teesside which are already very deprived . 
  in summary leaving would be a bad thing . 
  i think you 'd look good in [ one of these ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wkjdptmrz9u/s7w8oy6yszi/aaaaaaaaafu/hdpkemx223g/s1600/hignfy_ukip_dressing_gowns.jpg ), 
  you do n't have to pay people in north east england very much either . 
  ( just enough for carling , newcastle fc tickets , fighting and fake tan ), 
  $ $ $ selling them means we get more dirty dirty money to pass through london though !!,
