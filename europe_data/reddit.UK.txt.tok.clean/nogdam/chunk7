  yeah , sorry we fucked you over so much after the war .

  we certainly get lots of german businessmen here in the autumn to shoot them . 
  nice , reminded me a bit of the westcountry just the church tower looked a but un-english . 
  whereabouts were these taken ? 
  east anglia , more specifically south norfolk, 
  this is oilseed rape in bloom , taken a couple of weeks ago from my parents house . 
  [ 52 % ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/over-half-britons-surveyed-were-positive-about-polish-migrants-1431449 ) of us think they have made a positive contribution . 
  there some votes from the asian community ( they say they will relax the rules on bringing spouses and family members ) , but there is a lot of ukip support from unskilled males over 50 and also a large protest vote who stopped voting liberal democrat ( when they entered the government ) . 
  [ here 's some analysis ] ( http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/03/05/analysis-ukip-voters/ ), 
   the more people that share the posters and spread ukip 's message , the better for ukip . 
  i know it kills me , but i was interested what the reaction here would be . 
  in my opinion these are n't xenophobic ( ukip are extremely careful not to be branded racist ) but are intentionally misleading and play the politics of fear . 
  it goes without saying however that the majority of this parties support comes from xenophobes , just they also have a very vocal libertarian support . 
  but anyway ** vote green **, 
  much of the work taken by low skilled immigrants is non-unionised , in construction it 's common to blacklist workers for being union activists and there is pretty much no union representation for farm workers here . 
  i live in the east for england which has seen a large amount of eu immigration ( and subsequently ukip support ) . 
  in reality the farming jobs that are taken by immigrants here are either ones which , would have been done by irish immigrants ( before ireland reached the post-industrial stage ) , or jobs on industrial turkey farms ( these farms only opened when the labour market was opened up to the portuguese ) . 
  so really it 's a lot of fuss about nothing , just with a big dollop of good old english xenophobia on top .

  hello , [ monty python - what have the romans ever done for us ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9foi342lxqe ), 
  one thing i used to hate on the ferry from newcastle to gothenburg was the fact i could never understand the loud conversations people were having in swedish/norwegian and then knowing that if i talked everyone else around would know what i was saying . 
  i wish we had a unique language . 
  my sister applied about a month before her masters started , there is n't a national deadline in the uk . 
  [ the business school at my university lists the international deadline on the 30th of june ] ( http://business.leeds.ac.uk/masters/how-to-apply/ ) , but that will probably be flexible , if there are spaces on the course to fill the university will want to fill them . 
  i hope all of this helps . 
  here 's the website for the uk , it has some info on scholarships/bursaries you may be able to apply for , the foreign ( non eu/eec ) student market here is fairly competitive , although universities have become a bit of a political football recently . 
  ( if your considering working while you study a part time job ( 16hrs ) on minimum wage could bring in about # 5000 here , i think denmark has the highest minimum wage at the moment . ), 
  sorry i now realise i did n't word that post to say what i meant . 
  in the [ february 1974 election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_general_election,_february_1974 ) labour won 37.2 % of the national vote and got 301 seats , the conservatives won 37.9 % of the vote but only got 297 seats ( makes sense ? ) . 
  i meant to suggest that this may happen again in a close election . 
  you missed out ireland 's really short president coming to the queens dinner party for the first time . 
  [ here he is with a dog , prince and soldiers with funny hats . 
  ukip are the most libertarian in almost every sense , save freedom of movement . 
  they plaster it all over the literature : https://www.google.co.uk/#q=site:ukip.org+libertarian its just their older voters ( making up almost all their support ) who hark back to some 50 's illusion of white faces on biscuit tins . 
  their young support tends to be almost ultra libertarian , you may remember their youth leader was [ sacked for supporting gay marriage ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-youth-leader-olly-neville-sacked-for-supporting-gay-marriage-8444330.html ) they just know selling out to daily express-reading pensioners and bashing romanians is an easy way to get votes . 
   `` if we were in england it could 've been worse , we would 've scored over 180 seats '' yeah our election system sucks , it 's still possible in the uk to get over 50 % of the seats in parliament with less than 50 % of the national vote . 
  personally i can see that happening soon ( the next election might be tight ) and then our system will be changed in the uproar . 
  ( i wrote the wrong thing here , the point i really wanted to make is in comments below ),

  farage is too divisive , although he is loved by his supporters ( [ which peaked at around 20 % in 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_2015_united_kingdom_general_election ) ) , people who do n't like him ** really ** do n't like him , it showed in the general election ; seats where ukip was a credible threat saw massive tactical voting to keep them out ( not least the seat farrage himself contested ) . 
  the yes campaign will probably use this , there are votes to be won by equating voting no to an endorsement of farrage . 
  [ who would n't want to see europe 's widest waterfall .

  since 2000 the number of children alive in the world each year has remained stable , so if this continues the world population should stabilise at around 10 to 11 billion at around 2100 . 
  they 'll probably be another 2 billion in africa by then , but asia only has about 1 billion to grow before its birth rate should match the mortality rate . 
   making a lot of promises before the last election , that they did n't / could n't keep . 
  nothing like that happened with our social liberals !, 
  what 's causing radikale venstre to loose their vote share ? 
  i was invited to campaign with them as a liberal democrat in the uk ( could n't go in the end ) , maybe they wanted experts at doing awfully in elections !, 
  [ the official no campaign i believe , it featured in the * birmingham post * . 
  ] ( http://leftfootforward.org/2011/02/the-nasty-campaign-no-to-av-stoops-to-new-low/ ), 
   fptp ensures a strong government til there are no strong governments in europe , if anything the current conservative government is one of the weakest in years as its dependent on such a slim majority . 
  back bencher 's have already stopped the fast tracking of the promised human rights act scrapping . 
  and with our system if no voters in the eu referendum decide to unite behind ukip * snp style * we could end up with a ukip majority !, 
  [ that was before it became a referendum on the deputy prime minister .

  they represent the liberal left of the spectrum ( left with a very small `` l '' ) , in the past they have endorsed the liberal democrats for the purpose of voting reform . 
  they [ controversially ] endorsed the coalition this year because the owner did n't like the idea of milliband 's mansion tax . 
  [ here 's how readers voted !, 
  no but i remember [ * the animals of farthing wood * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_xaklafbqi ) , pretty sure it was shown everywhere in europe .

  at least tell us what this document is and give us the source . 
  go back to / r/coontown op . 
  no , the leaving age is 18 now , that 's why we 've seen recent growth in the hdi tables ( until recently we were behind slovakia ) . 
  i had some really lovely `` dark beer '' in kaunas , but i drank too much and forgot what it was called !, 
  but yeah that lithuanian beer . 
  if anyone wants to help me out with the name i 'd like track some down !, 
  if we end up with a coalition of the centre-left it could come up . 
  we had a referendum on a new voting system in 2011 , it did n't go well , the pro campaign was poorly organised and the anti campaign was very well funded , also there was no public consultation on the system we voted for which did n't help either .
