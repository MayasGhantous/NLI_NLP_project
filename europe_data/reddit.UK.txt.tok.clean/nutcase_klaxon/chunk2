  we just like to moan . 
  in england , the main ones that are taught at school - 1066 wars of the roses english civil war battle of trafalgar defeating the spanish armada ww1 ww2 suez crisis falklands war, 
  if there 's room to kick a ball , a ball will be kicked, 
  in the ` hope ' stage of '' ' i can cope with the despair , it 's the hope i ca n't stand '', 
  all the ugly people were transported to australia in the 19th century . 
  we 're used to it . 
  we had decades of ira bomb scares . 
  and ira bombs . 
  there 's a lot less of that sort of thing now . 
  the ira were pretty much non-stop for 30 years . 
  i do n't think there 's anywhere where gun ownership/use is not allowed at all , ( though a lot of americans seem to think it 's so ) , but there are different degrees of restriction . 
  in the uk , ownership of hand guns is forbidden for private ownership , except in northern ireland . 
  for other types of gun , a shotgun or firearms certificate has to be applied for . 
  to get one you will be investigated by the police , must prove that you have a safe place to keep your gun , and will be refused if you have a past criminal conviction , or a history of mental illness . 
  you must also have a good reason for having a gun , such as hunting , vermin control or target shooting . 
  self defence is not a reason for getting a licence - except in northern ireland . 
  my opinion ? 
  it works . 
  there is no visible lobby to change gun laws , and certainly not to make them more lenient . 
  yeah , i 've read shakepeare and kafka , and dickens and hardy and the brontes - but that 's not what i 'm picking out to read on my kindle on my commute . 
  what i read then - susan hill , phil rickman , ian rankin , william boyd , hilary mantel - off the top of my head . 
  families have tumble dryers , students have clothes horses / drying racks . 
  i think the reddit demographic gives a very skewed idea on the lack of dryers in europe . 
  i think it 's what we call pork belly, 
  in britain , when people ask if you 're alright , it 's just a greeting , say ` fine , thanks ' , they 're not asking because they think something 's wrong . 
  also , say please and thank you a lot . 
  a lot . 
  entire conversations can be had just with those two . 
  ( assuming you experience summer weather ... looking at you , united kingdom . ), 
  [ it 's been like this and is now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z5up9ny.jpg ) . 
  summery enough for you ? 
  picnics . 
  we do good picnics . 
  i refuse to countenance the idea of a picnic without pork pies , plus other kinds of flans , quiches , sausage rolls , scotch eggs and sandwiches . 
  strawberrries and cream - a bit early for them now , but they 're a summer staple . 
  champagne or sparkling wine if you 're feeling posh . 
  we had an empire . 
  we got rich and some great stuff to have in our museums . 
  but some very bad things happened in the countries we ruled over that are pretty indefensible . 
  i promise you not all puddings have blood in them . 
  unless you 're in whitby where they 're still having a bit of a vampire problem .

  in the uk most people do own a car . 
  mostly it 's 2 car families these days . 
  a car is not considered a luxury . 
  in london , it 's a bit different you probably do n't feel the * need * for one until you 've got kids . 
  most people use a mix of modes of transport . 
  there is decent public transport in most parts of the country , but you only have to look at the roads and hear the traffic reports to know - a lot of people are using a lot of cars . 
  i live in a city , so i do n't see * all * the animals that are native to the uk regularly . 
  but even so , see and hear quite a lot . 
  squirrels and foxes are very common . 
  foxes are very bold , and very noisy . 
  stories of people from overseas not used to the noise they make at night and calling the police because they think a woman or child is being attacked and screaming crop up frequently ( including on r/london ) in terms of birds - pigeons , which are a pest , little black and white pied wagtails are all over , magpies , crows , starlings , robins , blackbirds . 
  in nearby highgate wood i hear woodpeckers but never see them . 
  green parakeets - they pop up in unexpected places . 
  in some parts of london they 're quite a pest . 
  nobody seems entirely sure how they got here , obviously pets that escaped and have colonised certain parks . 
  the urban legend is that it was jimi hendrix who released the first pair when he lived in london in 1966-7 . 
  nearby rivers and streams have ducks such as mallards , and coots , and herons there are a couple of parks nearby that have deer , also ducks and various wildfowl - more mallards and coots , also swans and canada geese . 
  those are the animals that come to mind , considering i live in london , it 's quite a lot . 
   do drivers in britain ( or europe as a whole ) use american-accented voices ? 
  why on earth would they ? 
  people want to hear clear directions , in their own language and their own accents , with words pronounced the way they regard as correct . 
  it 's always the wrong temperture , it 's not fresh air , and windows that do n't open are a crime against humanity . 
  in the uk , almost unheard of in homes . 
  modern offices all have it , and nearly everyone hates it and goes round behind the back of office managers opening windows . 
  who are bryant and pike ? 
  what have they got to with breivik ? 
  what case you quoted ? 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
   i doubt the prison guards would even try to stop an attempt i 'm sure they would, 
  london , darling , not ` the uk ' . 
  oh , you mean , out in the sticks . 
  in london , nobody eats food anymore , that 's so 2010 , we 've been digesting pure fashion trends and pollution . 
  the gum in my pocket seems to be * checks packet * wrigleys extra peppermint . 
  so , that . 
  behave like a typical stag or hen group do . 
  brits abroad can be pretty disgusting :-(, 
  when i first got a kindle , a few years ago now , it took several phone-calls for them to not block me everytime i ordered a cheap kindle book . 
  it 's a known red flag to banks that fraudsters try a card out on something like that to see if it gets detected . 
  then once i got that sorted out , i had the same problem whenever i rented a film to stream from blinkbox . 
  i can walk to 4 different supermarkets in 5 minutes from my london flat . 
  if that 's not giving me enough choice , i can get a 5 minute bus ride to another 5 . 
  but even so , for big things and monthly ` bulk buys ' i order online from tesco and get it delivered . 
  that 's a very common way to get groceries in the u.k. 
  i do n't think anyone minds questions * from * americans , but the questions * about * america can get irksome , `` tell me what you think about american politics '' , `` tell me what you think about american culture '' , `` tell me what you think about america '' the sub they 're looking for is / r/tellmetheusaisgreat also known as / r/askreddit, 
  i live in london . 
  there are no no-go areas . 
  there are poor areas , there are run-down areas , there are areas that are dodgy . 
  those are in every city , and have always been there and have nothing to do with muslims . 
  the amount of outright bare-faced lies that some americans redditors have been told and believe , is jaw-dropping . 
  you should read this - it 's what happened when a redditor was challenged to go to woolwich with a bottle of wine in his hand . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/politicalvideo/comments/3vxy3l/trump_dares_morning_host_to_go_to_break_guess/cxrt4qp n.b. 
  woolwich is just a normal place , but i ca n't think of any part of london where you could n't do this , or where you could n't buy alcohol within a few streets . 
  there 's no shortage of pubs , off-licences ( what i think you 'd call liquor stores ) or supermarkets selling booze in any part of london, 
  we should build a wall to keep them out . 
  we 're all living under shakira law and we fucking love it !, 
  * merengues around room *, 
  it 's an interesting cultural situation , because from the outside , i think we could * look * like a quite religious country . 
  the church of england ( obviously i 'm taking about england here because it 's what i know best ) has a central role in the establishment , we have religious schools - people get hot under the collar about muslim schools , but there are 4,500 c of e primary schools ( [ i just looked up the figures ] ( https://www.churchofengland.org/education/church-schools-academies.aspx ) on this ) and over [ 2,000 catholic schools ] ( http://www.catholiceducation.org.uk/ ) .
