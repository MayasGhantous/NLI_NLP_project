  it 's about being fair , our country is orientating itself towards being a tax haven - people do n't want that . 
  and i know , deep down , that labour will not win . 
  i just want to hope that they will . 
  i have been trying to be hopeful . 
  i think the ` shy tory ' effect is n't at play this election because it 's not controversial to say you are voting conservative for a ` better brexit negotiation ' . 
  i actually think the shy tory effect might have done a 180 , the shy labour effect . 
  jeremy corbyn is presented as extreme , a terrorist sympathiser , and saying you support him could be seen as controversial . 
  the only hope left is that my hypothesis is true . 
  i could be completely wrong , but maybe the public have realised it 's gone too far with the tories . 
  i 'd love to see stv to encourage smaller parties . 
  i 'd love to escape the labour conservative pendulum . 
  ** brexit is happening ** - i do n't want it , but with the uk 's fptp system it 's impossible for the liberal democrats to be successful . 
  with a few exceptions , you have a choice - between labour for a softer brexit or the conservatives for a hard-right brexit . 
  if you oppose brexit here 's the best thing you can do ... ** if you live in a conservative seat : ** vote for the party voted second place in your constituency in the last election , whatever party that is ( unless it is ukip ) . 
  the conservatives ( & ukip ) are the parties advocating for the ` hardest ' brexit . 
  in many conservative seats the second highest party is n't labour , often it is the liberal democrats - make sure you actually check what last year 's results were . 
  ** if you live in a labour seat : ** any vote not for labour is a vote for the conservatives most likely . 
  labour * will * go through with brexit , but instead of giving the hard right conservatives a mandate for re-writing all of british law you are at least giving the opportunity to a more workers-oriented party . 
  labour * definitely * want a ` deal ' from the eu , whereas theresa may is playing with fire by threatening to take ` no deal ' . 
  no deal is a very very bad deal . 
  ** if you live in an snp seat : ** vote snp , the snp stance is for a second vote after getting the brexit deal . 
  that means that if the deal is terrible at least there will be an opportunity for us to reject it . 
  ** if you live in a lib-dem seat : ** well , this one is kinda obvious , vote lib-dem . 
  ** if you live in brighton pavillion constituency : ** vote green , any vote for labour or lib-dem is a vote for the conservatives . 
  # ** here 's what you should not do , or else you will split the progressive vote : ** * vote for any party ranked third or fourth place in the last election . 
  #and yes , i know the fptp system is shit . 
  it 's a shame our conservative government wo n't consider any change in drug policy despite it clearly not working . 
  well , there are still clear issues introduced where large wage disparity occurs on a more local level , even on a state level in the usa . 
  silicon valley has driven ordinary workers out of many properties in california due to skyrocket rents . 
  so theoretically if someone from mississippi moved to california for a blue-collar job but worked at a lower wage it would put more pressure on existing blue-collar workers in california . 
  the eu is all about having a borderless mass of cheap labour that transatlantic corporations exploit to undercut workers in western europe . 
  the people that suffer are the people at the bottom in these countries . 
  i like the idea of a united europe , but hate the idea of freedom of movement with such wealth disparity between member states . 
  it was a joke, 
  i suppose a perfectly correct monitoring is n't needed though , just enough people to * adequately * follow them would be enough . 
  it 's going to be easy to spot 3 terrorists , one from london and two from ireland meeting , hiring a van and having large knives . 
  they were n't very subtle and even primitive surveillance would be enought to flag that up . 
  but theresa banned them :'(, 
  pepe is waldo, 
  in most cases it 's probably one intelligence worker to a few suspects , but in cases where the movement of those potential threats needs to be watched i 'm sure police could be used too . 
  there are 3,000 people living in the uk on the terror watch list classified as posing an `` imminent threat '' . 
  those 20,000 police offers theresa may cut would be enough to watch every single one of them 24/7 . 
  can we stop sticking our fingers in our ears and realise that the amount of police do have a significant relevance to the ability for a terror attack to take place ? 
  well 20,000 is a lot of police . 
  * theoretically * 20,000 police officers would be more than enough to watch the 3,000 people on the terror list classified as posting an `` imminent threat '' 24/7 . 
  very true , they do exploit every single terror attack . 
  we already have very draconian surveillance laws in the uk - i ca n't really imagine what * more * they could do except make the data more readily available . 
  the conservatives support isis by supporting the saudi regime for their own financial ends . 
  i 've never seen a red squirrel . 
  three . 
  check this site regularly as they often have really good deals : https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/compare/sim_only_deals/ for example you can get 3gb for # 7.99 , 4gb for # 9 , 5gb for # 10 , 6gb for # 11 , 8gb for # 12 . 
  wow that 's terrible . 
  yeah , and i also think providing wifi is a bit beyond the scope of the state . 
  with data being so cheap these days ( i have 8gb of 4g for # 12 , and the uk is hardly cheap in terms of mobile data ) and free eu roaming happening i do n't really see the need . 
  the conservatives have caused so much wealth inequality . 
  [ over the last 9 years the uk is the * only * developed country that experienced gdp growth with a ** decline in wages ** ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h2akm9vw6mc/wlk2lipx6pi/aaaaaaaadr4/3c5hyqli8_0l-if6h8seyek1y1iea2vnwclcb/s1600/ft%2bwage%2bcollapse%2buk.jpg ) we 're being tricked, 
  interesting and strange in my opinion , i suppose perceptions towards privacy must vary in different countries . 
  countless crimes have been solved because of cctv footage in the uk though , just recently in a [ tv documentary episode called ` the met : policing london ' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b08s334d/the-met-policing-london-series-2-episode-1 ) they covered how they tracked someone that stabbed someone else in london wearing a mask using cctv footage until they took the mask off and caught the perpetrator . 
  i suppose so , the uk has been trying to balance a middle ground between both but it 's not really worked out that great . 
  source ? 
  on the other hand , it had a very high turnout for the uk , in 1992 the general election had a high turnout at 72.3 % , this referendum had 72.2 % turnout . 
  post-war the highest turnout was 83.9 % in 1950 . 
  it does seem british voters are more apathetic than in the past , but the brexit vote had a high turnout for recent history . 
  it looks to me that this would be a pivot away from the eu 's protectionism towards globalism . 
  easier access to a low-wage economy means it 's easier to move jobs there and adds more competition for european workers . 
  perhaps it 's a good idea to distance ourselves from china and move low-cost production to a democracy instead though . 
  most of these cctv cameras will be privately owned , i have cameras on my property , i 'm sure any intelligent business would too . 
  ip cameras are inexpensive ( # 40 or so ) so why would n't people use them . 
  one could argue on the other hand that inhibiting material trade could result in losing equipment that could save lives too , perhaps by having to use old cars with fewer safety features for longer , perhaps by making spare parts for vehicles more expensive , perhaps by making european weapons for fighting terrorism more expensive . 
  everything has a price , including safety . 
  failing to share intelligence on terrorists would be foolish , but i think a value should be put on it in the brexit negotiations if necessary . 
  that being said i think such a circumstance should be avoided to try to not sour the talks between the uk and eu , it would be preferable to have a civilised negotiation where the uk is given a fair deal and not have to resort to negotiating with resources like counter-terrorism . 
  i wish we had put tariffs on chinese steel . 
  my father works for an mri scanner and superconducting magnet manufacturing company in the uk , they need very high-end steel with strict specifications . 
  they have tried ordering this steel from china before , but what they state on their specification sheets compared to what they sell you vary wildly , they will ` dilute ' steel with cheaper metals to reduce costs , selling you something with different conduction and strength properties to what you were expecting to buy . 
  this means all the steel they buy has to be analysed for its composition and properties before use - which is unfeasible . 
  they used to source their steel from the uk , but since the steel plants failed they have from europe . 
  now many european steel plants are failing too . 
  the list of alternatives is getting shorter and shorter . 
  in a long-term strategic view , losing something as simple as steel is really short-sighted and dangerous to europe 's sovereignty . 
  i do n't want to be on the same side as trump ... 
  i agree , the conservatives have been hugely irresponsible in the last decade and caused damage that will last for decades to come . 
  probably an unpopular opinion , but how is intelligence resources being negotiated any different to a material or scientific resource being negotiated ? 
  the uk has invested a huge amount of money and has quite high expertise in this field traditionally since ww2 . 
  like germany makes great cars , the uk is good at spying . 
  the uk has built a services based economy , this is just one aspect of it . 
  why should this not be subject to negotiations when other countries will be using their resources for bargaining too ? 
  brexit worked i guess, 
  i disagree 1 . 
  what is the difference between the picture and seeing them in person ? 
  they are in a public space where there should be no expectation of privacy . 
  when you walk down the street you are captured by hundreds of cctv cameras , what is the difference ? 
  i agree on this point , although this seems to be faked for a viral video - the camera shots are too professional and the photos look staged anyway . 
  basically , yeah, 
  antifa are fascists, 
  i do n't really see it - i do n't know if you know this but british airways is n't owned by the british government anymore , but is a private company . 
  there 's really no relation between how british airways acts and the government . 
  i wonder that too , there seems to be lots of uncertainty in the airline industry around brexit and how regulation will look after brexit . 
  i doubt it will have a political implcation , the british have already felt the impacts of outsourcing and globalism with almost all manufacting disappearing . 
  i think the * real * discussion , if any , would be about investment to it - outsourcing almost always happens to reduce expense , maybe we need to get over this cost cutting attitude towards it and see it as more important .
