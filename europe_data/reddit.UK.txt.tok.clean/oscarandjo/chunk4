  if this is true we should be sending the army in to get it moving again and any protesters should be moved with force , as the protests are damaging . 
  romanian & polish immigrants ? 
  and this would never happen in the uk . 
  logical things like this never happen here . 
  it 's because as soon as they try something like this and something goes wrong the media goes crazy , even if it works for the majority of extremists - one mistake and no politician will ever be forgiven . 
  what an awful idea . 
  but that would be racist , it might not be muslims joining isis / s, 
  it 's for breakfast , it 's not meant to be spectacular :p, 
  not really an argument to make , most countries dishes are related to their culture and what foods were available there - the colonies being strongly related to britain 's culture . 
  food from colonies contributed to more english meals ( eg : chicken tikka masala ) being made . 
  they are great , the dutch have their sweet snacks on point - stroopwafels have taken off in the uk too  also hagelslag is great too . 
  poverty food ... 
  i wish we had taco bell here , or any proper mexican food :(, 
  fuck our houses, 
  i agree , its difficult . 
  stuff that is small like web pages , text messages before things like video streaming . 
  yep , that hits the nail on the head . 
  the classification is naturally biased and discriminatory and difficult to do . 
  agreed . 
  well , i 'm sure they may ignore it but if it ever became an issue they could enforce it . 
  this seems to relate to mobile networks only , and this is me being devil 's advocate on this point , the current 3g and 4g technology is limited by what is both * financially * possible ( how many masts can you cram into an overcongested city ) and what is * physically * possible given mobile spectrum avaliable . 
  phone providers get a limited amount of radio spectrum in which they can transfer data . 
  looking at the current rates of internet usage increasing we will face hurdles where the mobile networking infrastructure ** will ** become overloaded and these limits will become an issue . 
  phone providers try to tackle this by providing smaller data allowances , banning tethering or using throttling/blocks on heavy data users so that other users are not hurt by heavy users . 
  of course , no one likes this , but not everyone can guzzle unlimited data and still expect good speeds . 
  the idea that at some point we will need to prioritize data that is actually important over things like youtube and netflix video is something we will ** have ** to consider , and if mobile roaming is introduced smaller countries with lots of tourism and less advanced mobile infrastructure like greece will see a sudden surge in mobile data usage - they may be unprepared for this * ( and where will the phone providers get the money to support this upgrade ? 
  ) * another thing to consider is how this would affect data limits , they are there to limit the load on phone masts - if we could prioritise certain data over others then the issue of slow speeds would be reduced as important data would take priority . 
  this * could * result in larger data allowances . 
  oh right , so your providers are happy to reap the benefits ( $ $ $ ) of people roaming there but not to let you roam . 
  got it , 
  not necessarily , switzerland signed a deal with three uk ( http://www.three.co.uk/discover/phones/feel_at_home ) and i can roam there and use my contract for free . 
  i pay very little in the uk anyway so it 's quite surprising ( i pay # 10.90 for unlimited lte , 5000 texts and 200 minutes ), 
  i can already roam to france for free on three uk as well as something like 17 other countries . 
  it 's quite useful .

  the provider i 'm on ( three uk ) allows free roaming in about 18 countries including some eu ones like france and italy . 
  i 'm sure the eu will look at their successful implementation and consider that . 
  three allows you to use your full contract abroad if it is limited , if it is unlimited data then you get a 20gb cap . 
  you ca n't use it for an extended period of time ( months ) and it 's just intended for business trips of holidays ( so about 2 weeks max ) http://www.three.co.uk/discover/phones/feel_at_home, 
  more work, 
  ok , then it 's been pathetic at regulating ( or not ) such to promote the building of houses . 
  either way , housey not buildey . 
  of course it 's not an eu issue as it 's our own government 's fault - but people here blame the eu . 
  of course he did , there 's nothing he can do really . 
  i 'm not anti eu but you can certainly see why people are blaming the eu in the uk . 
  our government has been pathetic at building houses for decades now and the effects are hitting us with increasing immigration with increased house prices . 
  it 's simple supply and demand , more migration = more demand . 
  little supply + high demand = high prices . 
  i just hope i will be able to afford a house when the time comes ... 
  that 's not the point though - it says `` ramadan '' on it . 
  it 's not a fair comparison imo . 
  because less women stand for parliament . 
  just clarifying , i 'm pro-eu - just wondering what / r/europe has to say . 
  i want to stay in but i 'm in support of a referendum , we 've not had one before and many people have been campaigning to have one for years . 
  it 's only fair and democratic for us to have a referendum on something that affects our lives so much . 
  wow , the uk 's world regarded news exaggerated/lied about something ? 
  and to think i thought the uk 's `` free press '' was a good thing . 
  lets see if the je suis charlie movement will actually result free speech or if people will continue to pussyfoot around the subject . 
  blimey that 's quicker than i thought , i would n't be able to vote in that . 
  i hope it is later . 
  # 20 million wo n't be a significant enough campaign when the in movement will have the side of the current government and many big businesses . 
  even the daily mail is shifting towards staying in the eu . 
  but i swear every country has those people ? 
  why finland in particular ? 
  because it 's in his interests to stir a false sense of danger so that he can further take away civil liberties . 
  my philosophy lessons seemed to sway between eurosceptic propaganda and christianity in my class , the teacher made slides for other religions but every lesson whenever we got to another religion 's belief on the afterlife etc he just skipped the slides saying we were `` running out of time '' it 's got worse though , we 're taught about british national identity now ... `` what does it mean to be british ? '', 
  - bugger all . 
  when did you do your gcses ? 
  although i did n't do philosophy , none of my gcses were like that ( i did them this year ), 
  too bad he did n't show up for a prison sentence instead . 
  ah okay , it 's not in britbongese so i could n't read it, 
  parts of your country assigned for minority groups to live !, 
  brilliant idea germany  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ghettos, 
  speak a proper language please ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  i just read `` in europe '' in the title so thought it was a bit strange . 
  where is the uk ? 
  all that to get away from the french / s, 
  i agree completely , but unfortunately the rich people that can afford to but the panels live in colder parts of europe instead . 
  i know that germany is one of the best in the world at renewables , i 've heard that solar panels are very popular there . 
  more and more houses in the uk are getting solar panels but its still only a few ( maybe 1 in 25-30 houses where i live ), 
  i was referring to smaller economies , larger economies like germany are actually starting to invest in renewables, 
  growing economy leading to inevitable co2 increase ? 
  it 's like when recessions happen co2 production decreases worldwide , when smaller economies grow their co2 production does too most of the time . 
  uk stronk, 
  uk stronk, 
  the uk is hardly socialist . 
  the current governments cuts to welfare have hit people so hard that millions frequent food banks now , which i suppose will please you ? 
  uk stronk, 
  that 's harassment , we need to shut this sub down . 
  :( it 's just bant m8 bloody french ca n't even take the banter let alone fight a war , 
  why cruel ? 
  i think it 's just a running joke that the brits hate the french . 
  it 's not an actual rivalry .
