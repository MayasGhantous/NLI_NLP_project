  i think the solution is to import more old retired brits and promote more lads tours to shagaluf & ibeza . 
  i really think that the euro has been very destructive to mediterranean countries generally . 
  countries need more independence with interest rates etc. 
  that being said , coal should have been replaced by them instead ( not completely though for stability reasons ) - especially considering germany uses a dirtier burning coal compared to other countries ( eg the uk ) due to the types of coal present in german mines . 
  i would agree , as you seem to make sense , but since ww2 there has been ample housing for middle and lower classes despite having huge social housing . 
  it 's only since we started backing off from social housing that our housing crisis began and it 's only got worse . 
  i 'm not saying that social housing prevented it , but i think that a vacuum has been left from removing social housing construction that has n't been filled by the `` free market '' that was intended to fix it . 
  i 'm honestly not sure about how council housing or housing benefit works , but i know that people are constantly being evicted from parts of london and claiming `` social cleansing '' . 
  i think the chav dream of council housing is over now , but it 's not solving the main issue which is ** there are not enough houses being built ** . 
  whenever there is a discussion about housing , government policy towards social housing and rent caps and all that stuff always gets brought up , but the real issue is that ** there are not enough houses being built ** . 
  well not exactly , council housing does go to chavs a lot of the time , but it 's still additional house building . 
  it 's still people that would otherwise be renting/buying so it does decrease demand and thus prices . 
  it 's not like houses are just absorbed by the council , they were building them and they are no longer building them . 
  that 's the big problem . 
  exactly .

  wow i really did n't know it was that significant . 
  i tried looking for a similar thing of uk companies for the uk but could n't find anything . 
  i wonder how diversified we are in comparison . 
  i have n't looked into it before , but i 'm sure the bureaucracy would be bad . 
  the government 's self build portal has some information - i doubt 99.9 % of people want to build their own house though . 
  http://www.selfbuildportal.org.uk/ after a quick look , the plots of land are very expensive nearby me and the local authorities are quite stringent in the sort of houses they allow you to build . 
  i 'm sure spending on science and engineering returns a lot more to the economy than social policies like you suggest . 
  [ also here 's a graph of house prices adjusted for inflation . 
  ] ( http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/real-house-prices-91-.png ) [ this is a graph of the numbers of houses completed in the uk , as you can see the figure is far too low after the government discontinued local authority ( council ) housing . 
  this is because the government thinks the `` free market '' will fill the gap - you can see it has not at all and has declined !, 
  ] ( http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-21-at-10.05.57-500x344.png ), 
  the prices relative to wages and the rate of increase in house price . 
  it 's caused by a far too high demand and a far too low supply . 
  it is the main contributor to britain 's anti immigration attitude . 
  for the last 30 years the housing policy has been a complete failure , with births and immigration resulting in demand far higher than the amount of houses being created - basically we 're full up . 
  and the house prices reflect that . 
  it 's an issue so big because of how long it has been neglected for , and the only fix is a house building revolution bigger than after ww2 , but there is simply no change in sight . 
  it 's lowering people 's standards of living a lot , because unless you can get ontop of everything enough to get the initial deposit out for buying a house , you will rent for the rest of your life and rent is getting a bit insane too . 
  i know a polish person who returned to poland because they said too much of their british wages were spent on housing , and it was getting to the point where it simply was n't worth living here and they would rather return to their home culture . 
  from [ the telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/house-prices/12107545/uk-house-prices-jump-by-7.7pc-outstrippng-wage-rises-by-three-times.html ) `` house prices increased by 7.7 pc in the year to november 2015 , up from 7pc in the year to october . 
  by contrast , average annual wage growth is currently around 2.4 pc . '', 
  the entire housing industry . 
  and i 'm the loser . 
  we have old people with hundreds of thousands of pounds of gains in their homes/assets , while thousands are cashing in on the gravy train and chinese are buying up all the houses . 
  many people own houses just to rent them out because it 's so lucrative . 
  if i were born 50 years earlier and had purchased my house . 
  i could have sold it now , moved to somewhere cheap ( eg spain ) and lived a life of ease and luxury . 
  ** this is why so many british expats go to spain - they are the winners of the british ponzi dream . 
  you think that does n't happen in european countries , where each had their own colony , language , disputes , wars , history ? 
  i 'm sorry to say that america 's cultural differences ( your hot dog relishes/pizza toppings being different across states ) do n't count . 
  `` america is really diverse and so much changes from state to state '' - why do americans tell europeans this ? 
  maybe to an american, 
  yeah you have to wonder how long it will be before a drone will have some plastic explosives stuck to it and used maliciously .

  [ my city 's town hall . 
  ] ( https://barnabynutt.wordpress.com/2014/11/02/hove-town-hall/ ) it 's an old brutalist building that looks completely out of place in our city . 
  my city has a [ brutalist town hall ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hove+town+hall+brutalism&amp;num=20&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=783&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi31ta_p63lahvlg5okhxo7b5yq_auibygb ) too . 
  not my cup of tea but there are lots of blogs online about it , apparently some people come here just to have a look ? 
  i was so happy when a polish food shop opened nearby me . 
  plain digestives are insufferable , i 'd rather not have any biscuits . 
  put away the thesaurus , there 's no need to post like that . 
  ww1 and ww2 is surely more relevant and important ? 
  the weather is shit and no one will even acknowledge your existence . 
  i think when nuclear weapons were invented , forming empires ended . 
  it 's too risky . 
  forming empires is over , russia is super corrupt as well . 
  who thinks russia is entitled to the crimea ? 
  i 'm yet to meet a single non russian who thinks that . 
  this is what 's happening in the amazon rainforest for beef , the forestry is cut or burned down and its used to rear cattle instead ... 
   the office for national statistics data reveals that on average people used 15 tonnes of material in 2001 compared with just over 10 tonnes in 2013 . 
  i 'm quite surprised by this statistic , but more so by the domestic material consumption statistics below for the top 5 . 
  how can finnish people use over 3.8 times more domestic material than uk people ? 
  [ here 's a graph of uk consumption from 2000-2012 ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/chartimage?uri=/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/ukenvironmentalaccountshowmuchmaterialistheukconsuming/ukenvironmentalaccountshowmuchmaterialistheukconsuming/f34f2f33 ) , it makes sense that consumption fell during the 2008 crisis but what i find surprising was that it did n't increase after . 
  people have suggested many reasons for this , moving from physical to digital media is one , but perhaps peoples spare funds are being stretched by the housing crisis . 
  or looking positively , perhaps people are becoming less materialistic . 
  maybe this is a change for good . 
  i think people value minimalistic households and functional things rather than gimmics now . 
  it 's likely an apn setting , or an issue with your phone . 
  if you 're getting a new phone get it sim only and continue to use that contract . 
  from the comment replies i 've gotten there is literally no contract as good as that . 
  the false identification of tethering is n't a rare issue , but three do n't throttle/flag accounts - they just block as they see it occur . 
  this would n't happen on a new phone as it 's likely a defect with your current phone or sim . 
  yeah but 140 characters hardly uses much data . 
  no , you ca n't use the roaming constantly . 
  it 's intended for holidays , a few uses every year . 
  also germany is n't one of the included countries as their isps refused to make a roaming agreement . 
  that 's good . 
  yeah i have a bit of anxiety when getting calls because no normal person calls unless it 's an emergency . 
  in the uk if you advertise at unlimited and do n't have a very high cap the advertising regulator stops you . 
  my unlimited plan has no throttling or anything up to 1tb ( it would be hard to even hit that using your phone 24/7 ), 
  32kb/s is useless . 
  you ca n't do anything with that ... 
  no tethering at all , but if i use a vpn on the tethered device then they do n't detect that . 
  i never really need to tether though . 
   cheapest phone plans in europe after looking over that , it seems that it 's for the overall average spending - not spending per gb or something . 
  so if everyone in the uk signed up to 100mb contracts at # 3 a month , the uk would win , even if that meant that all the other plans were extremely expensive . 
  it just means that people on average spend the least in the netherlands , perhaps because they do n't need as much data . 
  from all the replies from germans and the dutch i 've gotten , none have good deals . 
  possible , but not if you are n't abusing it and running some kind of server ( torrents/other server ) . 
  i 'm definitely fine with the 1tb !, 
  it 's scary to see what 's happening to turkey .
