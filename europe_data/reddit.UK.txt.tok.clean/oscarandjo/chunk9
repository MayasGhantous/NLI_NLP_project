  ever since we lost the colonies we needed * somewhere * to pillage . 
  they use the same masts as ee for their 3g network so it ca n't be that bad considering ee have the best coverage . 
  you can only draw 13a at 240v from standard power sockets in the uk ( this is probably the case for the rest of the eu too ) which is 3120w . 
  i 'm sure uk home owners will be fine with getting their kitchen plug sockets adapted for 20.8 a as you proposed needing , but perhaps it would be a small market . 
  when i was in spain the villa i stayed in had the most pathetic kettle i 've ever seen in . 
  it was something like 800-1200w . 
  to boil enough water for two cups took over 3.5 minutes . 
  it was extremely frustrating . 
  yeah exactly , with vacuum cleaners the wattage was seen as the suction power to consumers . 
  this was n't the case , but as a result rather than making the vacuum cleaners more efficient manufacturers put the most powerful motor in possible to boast a higher suction , when in reality the extra wattage was lost to loads of heat and sound . 
  with kettles this efficiency limit does n't make sense , because ultimately you ca n't make an electric kettle more efficient unless you were to improve its insulation . 
  it would just be slower . 
  i liked the nrt norway ones . 
  that was great, 
  yeah i 'm always shocked to see the adverts for shit tier phones with tiny allowances for so much when i go to the netherlands . 
  i used to be on orange uk before they had a merger with t-mobile . 
  they were a bit shit but cheap . 
  in the uk our houses are unaffordable so you have that going . 
  last month the asking price for houses went up on average # 8.5 k. 
  my parents make more money from our house price appreciating than their wages combined ( engineer and admin for charity ) so i guess our cheap phones do n't really compensate for much . 
  really ? 
  that 's pretty standard here on every plan except the highest . 
  honestly i barely ever call anymore so its fine . 
  oh wow , i 'm only on a 1 month contract so they better not kick me off . 
  yeah i 've used it in france and spain . 
  i got a text after spain saying normally it would have cost # 3000 for the data i used but it cost me # 0 . 
  calls, 
  to be honest i 'll do that wherever i am . 
  i do it in the uk too . 
  well ultimately the french managed to trick the rest of the world into thinking they are food chefs because they use a fuck tonne of butter and garlic . 
  we 're onto you . 
  my unlimited plan stops after 1tb to prevent abuse , no limit other than that . 
  i think mobile broadband has been one of the few success stories of uk infrastructure . 
  i meant my phone provider silly . 
  if it fucked me over as bad as you i would switch . 
  that 's a crap deal in the uk even with the $ 15 deal , 1.5 gb is a small plan really . 
  hah , it 's three in the uk . 
  i recall the roaming is intended for holidays and not to be used over long periods of time , or else you get blocked . 
  that 's good . 
  i 've heard from a few people on here that my plan is unusually cheap for the uk . 
  it can but it does not because if it does i will leave it . 
  three from a year ago , do n't know what their plans are now . 
  okay , your network does that stuff but mine does n't . 
  i was just explaining why your analogy was incorrect and why not everyone can be given unlimited data . 
  three , signed up to it a year ago though . 
  well they are n't quite comparable . 
  with electricity or fuel , if you spend more that means that more is allocated towards oil drills and power stations . 
  comparatively , with mobile data the limitations are with the mobile spectrum that the government regulators have sold to isps . 
  even if everyone is paying absurd prices ultimately the laws of physics would limit the bandwidth within a given area of spectrum , either more spectrum would need to be bought ( almost impossible considering how quickly its sold ) or speeds would decline significantly . 
  the high prices for unlimited are basically just the isps way of limiting how many people will use lots of data . 
  it 's more likely to be future proofing , that or its just the backhaul to the particular mast or the theoretically achievable speeds . 
  if the 750mbps is shared between every node then that 's not that special . 
  but looking at how technology is going , i would not be slightly surprised if phones were capable of that soon . 
  with infrastructure projects its usually cheaper to plan ahead and do it once rather than twice or thrice in smaller increments . 
  i 've noticed that german and dutch phone plans are really stingy compared to the equivalent cost in the uk . 
  i get unlimited 4g , 5000 sms and 200 minutes plus 10gb of roaming allowance to 19 countries for # 10.90 in the uk , ( $ 13.83 ), 
  i get unlimited 4g ( 1tb fair use cap ) , 5000 sms and 200 minutes plus 10gb of roaming allowance to 19 countries for # 10.90 in the uk , ( $ 13.83 ), 
  he lost the labour party leader vote , so he probably hates jeremy 's guts anyway . 
  yeah what the fuck, 
  i hate it when human rights are used this loosely . 
  there is a difference between being fussy about what meat you eat and free speech , the protection from cruel and unusual punishments etc. 
  i have a muslim friend that told me that it 's okay for muslims living in western countries to eat non-halal meats as they are christian countries . 
  she does n't even eat halal . 
  [ uk labour party logo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tvtpksv.png ) , the more socialist left wing party . 
  x draconian policy - for the kids \u2122, 
  it 's so bizarre . 
  the uk population simply does n't give a fuck . 
  but our government seems to . 
  what i find so bizarre is that the party for the working class , labour , were encouraging mass immigration , something very anti working class . 
  # 5 per head , fucking hell that should be illegal . 
  letting public infrastructure rot like that is criminal . 
  wow the last picture is amazing . 
  well you would if you were so poor and had an embargo . 
  bring your non locking and under 3 inch pen knife then . 
  thanks for that reply , so it seems that the issue was that there was a lot of building and people got too confident in them selling quickly and ended up with a lot of unsold properties . 
  makes sense , but in the end , the houses were built which is the thing that matters . 
  i see . 
  this is a potential issue in the uk too . 
  it 's quite embedded in the british psyche that house prices always go up and that they are an investment rather than something to live in . 
  i wonder what would happen here if the same situation occurred . 
  you will need to pay * stamp duty land tax * when ** buying ** a house . 
  if you meet any of these categories you do n't have to pay * capital gains tax * when ** selling ** your home : * you 've lived in it as your main home for all the time you 've owned it * you have n't let part of it out or used part of it for business only * the grounds , including the buildings , are smaller than 5,000 square metres ( just over an acre ) so that means if a family has had their house value appreciate a lot they do n't have to pay additional capital gains tax when selling it . 
  you will have to pay yearly ** council taxes ** to the local authority ( city council ) based on the valuation of your house though . 
  my city has 9 bands of house valuations and taxes due based on these , so theoretically you will move up to a further band after a while , however usually they do n't evaluate your house value for decades so you usually do n't . 
  it really is madness , but lets not pretend that immigration is not a factor . 
  our population is growing far faster than our country can actually sustain currently . 
  can you elaborate how that economically fucked you ? 
  is it actually the cause of economic issues ? 
  i would have thought that cheap housing would mean lower rents and housing costs , meaning money could instead be spent on productive local businesses and thus contributing to the wider economy . 
  houses create nothing and therefore do n't add to the economy , they are simply a place to live . 
  you would have thought that the jobs created when building all those homes would be good ? 
  could you please explain how building lots of homes hurt your economy ? 
  also i wonder what is different between the uk and spain that results in the uk 's private sector being so crap , perhaps we have more regulations or something . 
  i know , '' `` made '' '' is definitely in quotations , but those retirees that sell their houses and move to spain will have made that much . 
  we live in a globalised world , so although houses will be really expensive here it just means a set of the population can sell their houses and piss off to somewhere cheaper and live as millionaires for no work . 
  my mistake , that 's a good point . 
  multiple things need to be done , to name a few foreign investors can be prevented from buying multiple houses ( or the purchase be taxed more to make it less appealing ) - much of the demand is from chinese investors who see how lucrative buying housing in the uk is , immigration must be reduced significantly and buy-to-letters must be slowed too ( perhaps with another tax ) . 
  most importantly we need a house building revolution , the government has been waiting for the free market to fix it for too long with diminishing returns . 
  the state needs to start building houses . 
  it wo n't be a single thing that solves this .
