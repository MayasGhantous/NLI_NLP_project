a lot of respect to the irish feller for staying calm and reasonable in the face of not just ignorance , but ignorance with no shame at being ignorant . 
  he even managed to plug irish tourism while he was at it , pretty damn smooth i must say . 
  edit : oh man , he nearly lost it at ~ 8:40 `` northern ireland should be the one not using the pound ... '' `` uhhhhh ... i 'm not sure i follow your logic '', 
  i 'll put you out of your misery [ he is quoting a slightly offensive song by eric idle ( of monty python fame ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wkgkv7nwyl4 ) ), 
  british/english-french rivalry took a back seat once the russian empire and then later the german empire , threatened the european balance of power . 
  i suppose it was a case of `` better the devil you know '' for them . 
  the general eu coverage in the uk varies a lot , though if a news source is even vaguely populist , it will be using a lot of `` shocking '' eu-negative headlines , giving overall quite negative coverage , especially if you just skim headlines . 
  though sometimes there can be humour , [ i quite like this recent telegraph cartoon on eu negotiations ] ( http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/christianadams/100076478/todays-cartoon-the-eu-cardsharps-after-caravaggio/ ) [ ( the original ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cardsharps_%28caravaggio%29 ), 
  my main concern with primaries coupled with a regional party list system would be that the chosen candidates would experience the `` safe seat '' problem where the only part of the election that matters is winning the primary . 
  that would be interesting , to have something like pmqs for your commissioner ( though i suppose something organised more around feedback than points-scoring ) . 
  thank you for your answers 1 . 
  with the lack of recognition of an eu wide candidate , i suppose nationally elected commissioners as national advocates makes the most sense on the short-medium term . 
  i have really appreciated websites like [ theyworkforyou ] ( http://www.theyworkforyou.com/ ) giving voters information not just about how your representatives voted , but what they said when they speak out . 
  i would love to see something similar for the eu . 
  i suppose transparency is a good answer . 
  * ** how do you feel about the possibility of the commission president being elected directly by the electorate ? 
  ** from the point of view of the uk , it was impossible to vote for juncker ( since no british political party is in the epp ) , and the only way to vote for an opposing candidate was to vote for a national party with views that you potentially did not agree with . 
  if the president was elected by a seperate ballot paper with a simple list of names ( and their bloc ) , would that be better because it is more democratic , or worse , because it would give the commission president too much legitimacy compared to the other parts of the eu political system ? 
  * ** how should the issue of mep -  voter accountability be solved ? 
  ** it is easy for national politicians to criticise the eu as a whole for unfavourable legislation or decisions , but the meps who vote for these decisions rarely if ever face accountability for the legislation that they vote for , so it is just the eu political system as a whole that is criticised . 
  this can be seen manifested in the [ low turnout of eu elections ~ 43 % ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/en/turnout.html ) . 
  what should be done to make voters feel that their vote is affecting what legislation passes the eu parliament ? 
  * ** should more countries adopt the stv system instead of party lists ? 
  ** this is related to the previous question . 
  currently , only roi and ni use stv , however , compared to party lists , it does have better individual accountability . 
  should this system be more widely applied ? 
  or will the added complexity only further drive away voters ? 
  * ** what would be your ideal selection process for the commission ? 
  ** it seems you feel strongly about the balance of power between parliament and commission , but how do you feel about removing the 1 country = 1 commissioner obligation ? 
  currently , national interests means that each country gets a commissioner , and they are effectively appointed by the government at the time . 
  this contrasts markedly with the elected , population weighted , nature of the eu parliament . 
  if `` ideal process '' does not exist , what would be the one change you would most like to see ? 
   looks to me like critique of tory policy to me . 
  or what you expect eu to force national parties to include what they actually plan to do with commission seat ? 
  they do n't know what position in the commission they are going to have before they negotiate , how is that the conservative 's fault ? 
  then that leaves the other 26 ordinary commission positions , which you then have absolutely 0 say in the person who gets it , so by design any one country will only ever get the ability to indirectly influence one out of the 27 commission areas . 
   i honestly do not know what you mean . 
  i mean it is natural in national democracies that leader of largest party ( coalition , voting block ) get highest job position . 
  except he is n't the leader of the epp , that is [ joseph daul ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_daul ) . 
  juncker went pretty much straight from being the pm of luxembourg to the epp spitzenkandidat just before the election . 
  oh , and as an aside , [ the epp got 29.43 % of the seats on a 42.54 % turnout , not exactly a firm mandate even if you do consider the system working as intended ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/en/election-results-2014.html ) ask yourself this . 
  are there any mechanisms in place where juncker , as the european commission president is going to be held accountable by the electorate of europe for his actions at an election ? 
  are the parties that make up the epp going to be held accountable for his actions in an election ? 
  is he going to be held accountable by the epp meps for the decisions he makes as the epp candidate ? 
   nope , your ( and mine and others . . ) elected government appoints his representative to eu commision to represent elected government view . 
  so my government , which does not have its commission nominee policy as part of the policy it was elected on , gets to nominate one member of the 28 member european commission , who will have one area of specialisation ( which is decided behind closed doors after he is nominated ) . 
  that is not democratic accountability . 
   seems to me that majority of parliament voted for him . 
  except by the current interpretation of the lisbon treaty , he was all but guaranteed the job by being the leading candidate of the largest bloc . 
  he is never elected or judged on his own policies and actions . 
   that 's a problem with the national electoral laws , not with the eu . 
  [ right , except it seems that every country except roi does it by party list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_to_the_european_parliament#voting_system ) . 
  so while technically , yes we could all use stv , we do n't . 
   that is entirely correct . 
  and not a problem at all , as they voted for candidates that did not make it to the ep , or , in making it , supported other groups/candidates . 
  my main point about the ec president is that he is not directly elected , he is elected by a plurality as a proxy of voting for the eu party which you voted for by proxy when you vote for your national party . 
  they do not campaign on their own merit , the fact that nobody in the uk could vote even if they wanted to for the candidate who won is just an illustration of the problem . 
  most `` presidents '' are selected by a direct vote . 
   so are the uk government cabinets - the only person in there that you 're guaranteed to have voted for is the prime-minister ( even if , by tradition , most ministers are also mps ) . 
  sure , not all ministers are elected ( some come in through the house of lords ) , however , the initial line up of ministers after an election is known at the time of the election , also , they are directly responsible for implementing party policies ( announced in the election manifesto ) . 
  while it is rare for a minister to lose his seat at an election , they do regularly lose their jobs when they or their policies fail , or become unpopular . 
  the eu commissioners are neither elected based on their policies , or should their policies be highly unpopular/unworkable , their job is not in danger . 
  accountability for policies seems rare , the only time i can see this happened was when the [ 1999 santer commission had to resign over corruption ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santer_commission#resignation ) . 
  the commission is far far more removed from the individual voter than the uk cabinet . 
  [ this was my reply in another branch of this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2kgac7/if_the_european_union_wants_to_dictate_to_hungary/cllc4o2 ), 
  eu democracy is homeopathic democracy . 
  you vote for a national party , which appoints meps from a party list , who sit with a european party `` bloc '' , the bloc with a plurality of meps which nominates the president of the european commission , and the european commission members are decided by negotiation between governments who each put forward a candidate and the european commission president . 
  this system means there is little to no direct accountability . 
  * you ca n't get vote for/against an individual mep because his party controls the regional lists . 
  * you do not vote for a commission president they are selected as a byproduct of people voting for their `` normal '' parties . 
  the epp which appointed juncker did so with a plurality of only 28.5 % of the total seats , [ and there is no epp member party in the uk ( so from my point of view , literally nobody in my country voted for him ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_people%27s_party#full_member_parties ) * the european commission itself is unelected , the appointees and their positions are all decided behind closed doors . 
  the uk is no stranger to democracy by various fudges and compromises , but there is no doubt that the current system is not very democratic . 
  he means the eu as the organisation , not the region . 
  the eu has to know that the timing of this demand is appalling for david cameron . 
  his party has just lost a by-election to a ukip defector , and is going to have another in less than a month , he is supposed to be restoring credibility on the eu by `` negotiating '' terms over issues ( like immigration ) , and he has a general election in just over half a year . 
  demanding a large sum of money from the uk basically destroys the one shred of credibility cameron had with regards with europe , which was that he had managed to contribute to a slower rate of eu spending increases . 
  if i was a suspicious man , i would suspect the european commission of trying to manipulate the outcome of the uk general election . 
  using ukip to make sure the conservatives vote is split and they fully lose power , because if you wanted to do that , this is the way to do it . 
  [ the uk 's poor experience in the erm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_wednesday ) has shaped public opinion on the issue . 
  that was the event that closed minds to the emu . 
  the legacy of black wednesday is a skepticism about monetary union with a larger region with a very different economic environment , [ this led to the chancellor in 1997 to insist on `` five economic tests '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_economic_tests ) to decide whether the uk should join the emu . 
  also , the belgian statistics are relatively high resolution compared to many other parts of europe . 
  i 'm sure if the uk were broken down into similar sized chunks , there would be a few comparable hotspots around some of the poorer urban areas . 
  england and wales together is ~ 56 million people counted as one region on this map , which is roughly five times the population of the whole of belgium . 
  i would n't say it was specifically about the uk the top 6 countries are all western european countries , while the bottom 6 countries are all eastern european countries . 
  eu migration causes cancer, 
  however , there is at least one crucial difference between ireland and greece . 
  [ ireland 's massive debt was low until the government guaranteed the debt of its domestic banks . 
  so although the irish economy was booming on an unsustainable property and banking industry , the country 's flaws are not too deep . 
  ] ( http://www.ntma.ie/business-areas/funding-and-debt-management/debt-profile/historical-information/ ) [ greece 's debt crisis has been a long time coming , but got far far worse once they managed to join the euro , and found they were able to borrow money at will ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_government-debt_crisis#causes ) . 
  i want to be optimistic about greece , but their problems are so much deeper than ireland 's . 
  except that same money spent by russia has greater [ purchasing power ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity ) as well as the economies of scale of one large military ( and their thriving export business ) bringing down unit costs . 
  if you want some more examples , [ this is a fairly large list ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_multilateral_defence_procurement ) there are certainly some things not on there , that are still in early stages , like a france-uk drone project . 
  except that makes the opposite point . 
  the fact that countries outside nato , like ukraine and georgia have been invaded by russia , probably makes the baltic states happy they are in nato . 
  i would be pretty surprised if a referendum to leave the eu was close . 
  there is far too much support for the uk 's eu membership from : politicians , business , the media , and both the rest of the eu and the usa . 
  i 'm sure there are plenty of scots who can testify at the strength of an establishment fear campaign . 
  speaking of which , scotland would possibly threaten to stay in the eu if england voted to leave it . 
  threatening the end of the union again , which itself would help sway the unionist nationalists .
