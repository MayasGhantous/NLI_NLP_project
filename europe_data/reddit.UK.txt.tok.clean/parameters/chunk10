  [ obligatory diana assassination sketch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4mefc1ee7q ), 
  i never said there was . 
  i simply said that it was possible to counter or mitigate many of the methods used by nato air forces, 
  those who used the radar for too long were destroyed , however there were many [ techniques used to avoid destruction , while still threatening nato aircraft . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zolt%c3%a1n_dani#preparations_for_the_conflict ) the point is that the same air to ground techniques which wiped out iraq 's air defences , allowing iraq 's army to be savaged by low flying aircraft , failed to do the same to the serbs who were using pretty much the same obsolete kit . 
  how did they shoot down a us stealth aircraft if they never used radar ? 
  nato was not able to fully suppress serb air defences , and in nearly three months had only destroyed 22 serb armoured vehicles . 
  you 're right that if they had to fight an enemy on the ground , then concealment would have been harder , but [ decoys can be emplaced very quickly ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11511886 ) i 'm sure the use of decoys has been studied , and if nato fought the same war again , it would do better . 
  unfortunately , russia has probably studied the lessons of kosovo just as much . 
  i would say the most important part is that there are a lot fewer germans today who will defend the actions of hitler and the nazis , than there are russians willing to defend the actions of stalin and the ussr . 
  we really do n't know how it would turn out . 
  the serbs with russian advice were able to conceal most of their equipment from nato bombing in kosovo . 
  whether russia 's camouflage and dummy vehicles / microwave emitters will work in an actual conflict in the near future is something we do n't know , and hopefully wo n't have to find out . 
  i meant peace after 1815 , and i meant keeping the peace kind of the same way the usa kept the peace after the end of the cold war . 
  i guess coming out on top at the end of the napoleonic wars and spending the rest of the 19th century keeping european peace , while being a colossal dick to non-europeans ranks as the proudest moment from a nationalistic perspective . 
  though considering the suffering caused by empire , a safer choice is the process of transitioning from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one , which admittedly is n't exactly a moment , considering it encompasses so many incremental changes from the medieval ( eg magna carta ) to the modern ( constitutional reform is ongoing ) . 
  the portugese king did n't do too badly though . 
  he escaped to britain and lived another 22 years comfortably . 
  considering what [ happened to the russian tsar and his family ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shooting_of_the_romanov_family ) after the russian revolution , i would say he got off lightly . 
  i was just saying that it is unlikely the usa would use the a-10 alone in low altitude attack passes because it is too dangerous . 
  the latest russian mobile sam system , the [ pantsir-s1 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pantsir-s1 ) is capable of keeping up with tanks , and can even fire missiles against aircraft while on the move . 
  [ its predecessor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k22_tunguska ) , which is still in service , is by no means obsolete either . 
  in this case the a-10 would mostly be a platform for the maverick missile fired at long range , which is ubiquitous to [ nato jet aircraft ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agm-65_maverick#launch_platforms ) . 
  the a-10 will make a contribution , but it is n't in itself decisive . 
  the a10 is nice against an asymmetric opponent , but is neither survivable enough against the latest russian air defence systems , nor its cannon reliable enough against the latest russian mbts to be scary on their own . 
  if i was a russian tank driver , the thing giving we sweaty palms would be the sheer number of ; vehicle , infantry , and air launched anti tank missiles the west has that were specifically designed to destroy the very vehicle you are sitting in . 
   usa is the greatest boogeyman ever . 
  i do n't think they need europe to convince the population there 's a threat . 
  except the usa has removed most of its forces from europe since the end of the cold war , and is [ continuing to close permanent bases ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/08/us-usa-defense-europe-iduskbn0kh18o20150108 ) . 
  it is hard to keep talking about an increasing threat , when the `` threat '' is measurably decreasing . 
  it is right for europe to increase its defences , and for the usa to demonstrate its support , as inevitably russia will continue with provocations . 
  personally , i think a strong military stance is important for peace . 
  the worst outcome for peace would be if russia thought nato force reductions meant they would not respond to the occupation of parts of the baltic states . 
  well , it depends what you think the kremlin 's goals are . 
  europe re-militarising would only be a bad thing for them if they were going to properly invade . 
  whereas , if their actual aim is to create an external threat to keep the russian population supporting the government , then a  80 % putin approval rating suggests their plan is working so far . 
  they have already got mq-9 reaper 's so they do n't need to worry about building drones now . 
  however , they need to develop the uav building expertise , so that what they make in future is competitive with the usa and israelis , who have been heavily developing theirs for decades . 
  the forerunner to the reaper , the predator drone was introduced in 1995 ( 20 years ago ) , and has been used with missiles since 2001 . 
  ten years is n't as long as you think in peace-time military equipment development . 
  that would be true if the issue was just high french wages , however this is not the case . 
  [ according to eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/labour_cost_structural_statistics_-_levels ) [ the proportion of hourly labour costs ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/89/structure_wage_and_non-wage_costs_-_lcs2012.png ) that is `` social contributions '' ( money to the state ) per employee is the highest in europe , while the proportion that is money to the employee is the lowest . 
  i just wonder how it could ever be possible for politicians not to have conflicts of interest , when that much money is involved, 
  i dislike affirmative action and minority quotas in general , but i do believe that there is a time and a place for it . 
  the most important thing to me is that it addresses an urgent issue , and is only a temporary measure . 
  if it has come to a situation where the police 's ability to combat crime is hampered by a deep-rooted perception that they do not work with the best interests of a minority community at heart , then recruiting police from that minority is a legitimate answer . 
  one case where i believe it helped was as part of the northern ireland peace process . 
  the protestant dominated [ ruc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_ulster_constabulary ) was treated with mistrust by the catholics ( with good reason ) . 
  as part of reforms to make the new [ psni ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/police_service_of_northern_ireland ) accepted by the catholic community ( alongside greater accountability ) there was affirmative action to increase the proportion of catholic officers in the police . 
  after ten years catholics had increased from 8 % to 30 % of the psni , the measure was deemed to have served its purpose , and was ended . 
   * `` the police are the public and the public are the police . 
  '' * i 'm against `` affirmative action '' in most situations , however , when it comes to the police , especially those on the front line , i can understand the justification for it up to a point . 
  to quote president obama 's speech to the ghanaian parliament in 2009  [ now , make no mistake : history is on the side of these brave africans , not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power . 
  africa does n't need strongmen , it needs strong institutions . 
  ] ( https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/remarks-by-the-president-to-the-ghanaian-parliament/ ) something similar applies to russia . 
  until there is ; the rule of just law , a separation of powers , and functional , respected , checks & balances to power , russia will either have a putin or a yeltsin . 
  an autocrat in the kremlin monopolising power and appealing to nationalism , or a power vacuum exploited by those with wealth and ruthlessness . 
  whether you can trust russia will depend on how a future government works , or does n't . 
  of the remaining former yugoslav countries , i think serbia is probably the best candidate to join next . 
  its government is functioning reasonably well , they have done a good job on finding and arresting war crimes suspects , and cyprus was still able to join the issue despite the intractable nature of its territorial dispute , so i do n't see why kosovo should be a barrier to entry . 
  are there any other severe issues ? 
  ** military industry protectionism ** sure britain has opposed some of the cooperation , but if you wanted a fully unified military , all of the big four would oppose it to a degree . 
  germany , france , uk and italy all have substantial defence industries . 
  they want to protect them , not just because of jobs , but because retaining the capability to make your own military hardware is important to a country . 
  also , the economic benefits of the locations of military bases & training facilities will be a point of contention . 
  those `` efficiency savings '' will be at the cost of some countries industry . 
  ** independent action ** mostly the uk and france , but potentially other countries would like the ability for their national government to deploy their military to secure their interests . 
  the eu is nowhere near politically unified , several countries aim for neutrality , and others may even take an opposing side on some issues . 
  an example i would give is the uk 's unilateral intervention in sierra leone , both in the civil war in 1999 , and again in 2014 with the ebola outbreak . 
  it is unlikely that the eu would act with the speed the uk military was able to in these situations . 
  ** pride in tradition ** i am fairly sure this is true of both the uk and france , and it would probably have been true about germany until the middle of last century , but a pride in the tradition of the army/navy/air force and the regiment/squadron/ship ( name ) you belong to is a big part of identity . 
  the esprit de corps that currently exists is something that is hard to build from scratch . 
  it can be done , and current formations could be integrated into an eu army , but it is not something to be treated lightly . 
  what do you mean by eu military ? 
  do you mean as in all eu countries give up their own military independence , or do you mean a new military formation created which answers to the eu leadership ? 
  i do n't see any issues with nato , especially considering how much more capable the us armed forces are compared to the total of the eu nations . 
  whatever happens , the security provided by having an explicit promise from the usa is not something to give up by choice lightly . 
  i can potentially see some regional consolidation where nations have similar policy needs . 
  for example , a combined ; poland , lithuania , latvia and estonia military . 
  because all four of those countries are in nato , have the same military concern ( something coming from the east ) , do n't have any reason to need an independent military and the baltic states are unable to support many military capabilities alone ( diverse air force , tank formations , green-water navy ) . 
  however , an eu wide merging of armed forces ? 
  it 's possible , but not for several decades , if ever . 
  russia may be a bit more threatening than ten years ago , but it still is n't enough to overcome national interest . 
  portugal is geographically isolated from the core of the euro-zone . 
  if we consider france + germany + benelux + austria + italy ( north ) as the core of the euro-zone , both portugal and greece are far away from this . 
  businesses in this core area derive large benefits from the cross border trade facilitation of the euro , while portugal does not . 
  not only does it only border one euro-zone country , spain , they do n't even have that large a proportion of their population and industry close to the border and the good infrastructure links . 
  portugal may be better off in the euro than out of it , but it is still reasonable to suggest it does not benefit as much as some others do . 
  its good to hear something positive from the region . 
  i ca n't imagine how i would feel if it was my family held prisoner for years . 
  i only hope that the terms of their release do n't lead to the death or suffering of others . 
  i do n't think anybody in europe flies the f15 . 
  anyone rich enough to buy it , bought local ( typhoon , rafale ) , everyone else bought something cheaper . 
  you mean f16 maybe ? 
  it 's back in iraq though . 
  as long as the us is going to be fighting asymmetric wars , a dedicated cas aircraft will be useful . 
  i think much of the scepticism about the retirement is that the f35 which is supposed to replace it will likely be less cost effective , and less capable ( in a no sam area ) . 
  the f15c is very capable , probably comparable ( or better ) to anything eu air forces have ( except maybe late tranche typhoons ) . 
  it 's being phased out gradually in the us because they are trying to move to a mostly/all 5th generation fighter force . 
  however it is nowhere near obsolete .
