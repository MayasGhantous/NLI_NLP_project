  it 's expensive moving planes around , so it 's definitely appreciated . 
  no you 're wrong . 
  its great ireland , of the irish isles . 
  they 're still using the fn mag and fn minimi , so in a way i guess they are . 
  huh , it was a similar story with the british l85 . 
  they replaced the popular fn fal , [ with a new plastic gun with atrocious build quality and reliability , far worse than the overheating issues reported in op 's article about the g36 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sa80#service_and_modification ) i guess the difference is that the public outcry over the issue in britain forced the government to face the issue instead of sweeping it under the rug ( possibly because there are people in the mod very good at leaking things to military sympathetic newspapers ) . 
  the l85a2 is n't perfect , but it seems to have been one of the less pressing equipment issues in afghanistan / iraq . 
  right , but unlike japan , it is possible in europe to build nuclear reactors in a place with ; low geological activity , good access to water , and sufficient population density to use the power . 
  i am not against nuclear power , i am stating that choosing not to put in in portugal does make some sense . 
  right , and i 'm not against nuclear power , i just think that where possible , it should be sited in a geologically safe area . 
  so if you want to build a nuclear power plant in the iberian peninsula , [ northern spain might make sense ] ( http://www.share-eu.org/sites/default/files/v6.2.share_eshm.png ) . 
  it has geological stability , it has population density , and it has access to the sea ( for unlimited water ) . 
  [ one of the most powerful earthquakes in recorded history occurred in portugal . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1755_lisbon_earthquake ) after japan 's experience with [ fukushima ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fukushima_daiichi_nuclear_disaster ) , portugal is probably right to give nuclear a miss . 
   [ the missile has a range of 11,300 kilometres ( 7,000 mi ) , a top speed of over 13,422 mph and a cep ( accuracy ) of less than 120m . 
  the missile uses an ** inertial guidance ** system combined with ** star-sighting ** , and is ** not dependent on gps ** . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uk_trident_programme#trident_ii_d-5_missiles ) afaik no ballistic missile system is solely dependant on gps , because the assumption is that the gps system in a real war is vulnerable to both jamming of the signal , and physically destroying the satellites . 
  without gps the missiles accuracy might be a bit lower , but it will stilll be accurate enough for a ~ 100 kt warhead . 
  [ hey , it could have been worse . 
  at one point o'leary , of ryanair fame , suggested ditching co-pilots on regional flights ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/sep/08/ryanair-axe-unnecessary-co-pilots ), 
  before the referendum in scotland , voter turnout was some of the lowest in the uk . 
  the fact that they were being given a vote on something that was both divisive , and that would have a huge impact on everyone in the country , galvanised the people into participation . 
  a properly run eu referendum in france could do the same thing . 
  there are a lot of famous irish actors , yes , but also musicians , writers and historical figures ( irish born people played a big role in britain , the usa and the commonwealth }, 
  the old harriers are all gone , so there is nothing to fly on a carrier . 
  the fleet air arm are waiting for the f35b to be delivered . 
  but of course there are issues with that . 
  except unlike the draw of a card or the rolling of dice , the vast majority of air disasters are not `` random '' events . 
  bad pilot decision making , aircraft design flaws , substandard maintenance , lax security and unforeseen hazards are all things that airlines can improve on to reduce the risk of further incidents . 
  what happened with the french navy was quite a shame for those who have n't heard about it . 
  [ british paranoia resulting in many french dead ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/attack_on_mers-el-k%c3%a9bir ) [ when the french in the end did their best to prevent germany seizing their navy , even well into the occupation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scuttling_of_the_french_fleet_in_toulon ), 
  oh absolutely . 
  the conservatives are basically an english party , and unless there is some sort of proportional system introduced for westminster that wo n't change . 
  well , for one example , energy . 
  snp is pro-wind ( due to its large amounts of reserves and wind turbine manufacturing capacity ) and oil services ( also a scotland dominated sector ) , but anti-nuclear ( which is currently in the process of being renewed in england ) . 
  taxation of various industries are likely to be rebalanced to give scottish industry a competitive advantage . 
  while salmond 's 3 % corporation tax cut has been [ dropped by nicola sturgeon , the concept of giving competitive advantages to scotland based businesses has not ] ( http://www.gov.scot/resource/0047/00472389.pdf ) . 
  the snp has spent months demanding tax breaks for north sea oil investment , it seems likely this is the path they will favour . 
  there is nothing wrong with incentivising regional growth , but a party that has literally 0 accountability outside scotland will find it very tempting to look out for its own electoral future . 
  whether you 're living in scotland or not , vote for the candidate who best represents your personal views , whoever it is , whatever party they represent ( or none , if independent ) , i 'm not claiming the snp are evil england-hating miscreants , they are n't , i am just voicing my concerns in `` what-ifs '' about a labour minority government dependant on the snp . 
  i dislike tactical voting , and since an election is never won on a single vote , frankly , it does n't really matter how you , as an , individual vote . 
  it simply matters that you do vote . 
  to me , participation is what counts . 
  low vote participation among the youth and racial minorities is almost certainly factored into the way governments behave toward those groups . 
  i do n't think fptp will be justifiable in future , simply as the two main parties lose share , especially in non general elections . 
  until then , we 're stuck with this headache of fptp without majority government , the worst of both worlds . 
  full disclosure , i am english in the south-east . 
  * the snp are only accountable to the scots , because they only contest scottish seats . 
  this means that the way they vote in westminster will naturally favour scotland , because that is who their voters are . 
  they have stated they will look out for all citizens of the uk , but , for example , it will be politically very easy for them to approve otherwise controversial regionally redistributive taxes , for example , which mostly hit those in the south east , and will barely touch scotland . 
  * currently the snp [ does not vote on matters in westminster that are devolved to scotland ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-30917414 ) . 
  however , for a coalition to work this would have to be fully abandoned . 
  while i do think there needs to be reform to account for the [ west lothian question ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_lothian_question ) , this snp/labour government would force it into the open very quickly indeed . 
  * the snp have ruled out a coalition in the sense of a joint government ( where they would share accountability ) , but will choose whether to support labour on a case by case basis . 
  this is fundamentally different from the current coalition , and puts the snp in a position where a relatively small party ( with perhaps a few dozen seats ) will be able to dictate policy to labour , salmond saying [ `` if you hold the balance , then you hold the power , '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/election-2015-snp-will-hold-thebalance-so-have-the-power-says-alex-salmond-10126415.html ) is n't a threat , it 's a simple statement of fact . 
  * the snp has just come out of a referendum to end the union . 
  that is still probably the defining policy of the snp . 
  part of me is wary that there is a large chunk of the party who , rather than be concerned with running and bettering the uk as a whole , are more interested in fostering the divisions that will ensure that it ends . 
  i may be wrong , but alex salmond , who is probably going to be elected into westminster , has already noted that it is perfectly possible for the snp to achieve [ independence by incremental change rather than a referendum ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/salmond-we-don-t-need-referendum-for-independence-1-3548270 ) . 
  i do n't think it is paranoid to believe that the snp would try and work toward that , demanding concessions for its support . 
  when a country is caught up in patriotism , it takes a brave person to vote with their conscience . 
  [ famously in the us , only one congressional representative voted against the aumf the week after 9-11 , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbara_lee#aumf_opposition ) which is still being used to justify us military action 14 years later , even with osama bin laden dead . 
  of course , i do n't want to say the us and russia are the same in this regard ( after all , barbara lee is still in congress , and received government protection from those who threatened her ) , but just to remind everyone that a government able to call on unquestioning support is a scary thing , and it can happen anywhere . 
  eh , i just take a few issues with that level of sanctimonious language in your comparison ; * europe does n't have a bunch of boats threatening to shoot attempted migrants . 
  in fact i believe italy was criticised for reducing its spending on coastguard patrols , because they have saved so many migrants . 
  * migrants are mostly not leaping out of conflict zones to sail directly into europe . 
  they choose to travel large distances away from the conflict area , away from closer safe areas to get here . 
  if you were an east berlin citizen , it kind of made sense to get into west berlin , since there literally was no other choice . 
  * i dislike the weasel deployment of the phrase `` many in this subreddit '' , and connecting those who want to restrict mass migration with wanting the migrants dead . 
  you might be surprised to learn it is possible to be both against unrestricted migration , and against migrants dying . 
   [ approximately 470 million people speak spanish as a native language , making it second only to mandarin in terms of its number of native speakers worldwide . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_language ) apart from the usa and uk , the populations of most of the english majority language countries are pretty modest . 
  it 's entirely possible the conservative 's get a majority . 
  as you correctly stated , the economy figures are definitely looking up which gives them a lot of credibility . 
  you can see how they have positioned themselves , they have got the guarantee of a eu referendum to try and head off ukip on the eu , and in the latest budget , they have dramatically narrowed the spending gap between them and labour to head off on the `` squeezed middle '' and public services , while talking up the fear of a labour minority government . 
  i do n't think anyone doubts the conservative 's will get the most votes and the most seats , however , there are two big issues . 
  [ the proportion of votes going to the two main parties is declining ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_in_the_united_kingdom#/media/file:uk_parliamentary_elections_from_1950_graph.png ) , so despite first past the post , it is getting less and less likely there will be a majority government . 
  [ the current constituency boundaries mean that the conservatives get fewer seats ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first-past-the-post_voting#/media/file:percentage_graph_uk_politics_2005.png ) for a given percentage of the national vote than labour , so the conservatives do n't just need to beat labour , they need to beat them heavily . 
  if the general election goes as badly for the lib dems as the european elections did , i do n't think the party would survive another coalition with the conservatives . 
  true , ukip would be lucky to get seats into double figures . 
  what would happen if conservative has the most seats , but still a few dozen short of a majority is anyone 's guess , nobody with that kind of seats would be willing to do a deal with them , since the lib dems will be both annihilated in terms of seats , and unwilling to ever work with cameron again . 
  i think that when it comes down to it , a uk eu exit by referendum is unlikely . 
  just like the scottish referendum , if things start looking a bit wobbly in the polls on the run up to referendum day , all the political parties , business groups , media companies , and probably the eu itself , will launch a heavy campaign to sway the swing voters . 
  the upcoming election looks worrying . 
  there is a very real possibility of either a labour minority government with the snp holding the balance of power , or a conservative minority government with ukip holding the balance of power . 
  i do n't look forward to either of those scenarios . 
  personally , i think a eu referendum should happen as soon a possible , partly for democratic reasons , but mainly just so the matter is settled so we can move on without it distracting the government . 
  during the cold war , india was mostly in the ussr 's sphere , and they had a strong tradition of socialist ideology . 
  their mortal enemy , pakistan was the usa 's regional ally . 
  interesting , so is this just an online `` viral '' video , or has it actually been shown on national tv ? 
  considering the country is effectively at war , i respect their decision to focus on celebrating the ukrainian army as an ordinary citizens army , instead of trying to appeal to militaristic power fantasies or anti-separatist / anti-kremlin sentiment . 
  however , heathrow airport has by far the most passengers in europe ( third in the world ) , and when it comes to shipping we have quite good ports , plus , due to our island geography , most of the country is near the sea . 
  i did n't get that impression , my take away from that programme was that in france there is a sincere belief among much of the french electorate ( especially the unions ) that they do not need to reform to remain globally competitive , and there is paralysis from fear among the french politicians , about pushing reform being political suicide . 
  hence the push-back against sarkozy 's limited attempt at competitiveness reform , resulting in it immediately stalling , anger at hollande abandoning his socialist promises , and now their willingness to turn to marine le pen when she promises a continuation of the french employment and welfare system . 
  also , the ventilation system necessary for a 80 km tunnel full of diesel/petrol burning vehicles would add considerably to the cost . 
  it felt like there were nearly as many tries in one day as the rest of the tournament put together . 
  the day could n't have been any more exciting . 
  congratulations to ireland !, 
  except the offer to ukraine from the eu which initiated this chain of events , was only for access to the efta , with a view to preparing for eu membership .
