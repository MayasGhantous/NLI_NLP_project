  perhaps the expert meant that you ca n't detect poisoning with a purely alpha emitter by simply using a geiger counter , because not enough radiation will be emitted from the body to be detected externally above the background . 
  the journalist might have tried to simplify the experts words , and ended up oversimplifying it . 
   five other officials also died in mysterious circumstances this year . 
   all of them supposedly took their own lives in the past six weeks holy shit , seems like someone is cleaning house . 
  it 's a shame that the hope that ukraine is going to be peaceful by next year is looking more and more unlikely . 
  if i was someone who identified as russian in donetsk , this would not be encouraging me to talk peace . 
  that is the point , merkel is not attending the parade , but is laying a wreath at russia 's tomb of the unknown soldier the following day . 
  balancing a respect for the dead , with a disdain for the politicisation of their deaths . 
  i do think merkel took the correct path . 
  it is correct to refuse to attend a celebration of today 's russian armed forces , but it is also right to pay your respect to the incredible sacrifices made by the people of the ussr 70 years ago . 
  well , the other problem is the ni budget issues . 
  currently the rest of the uk subsidises ni heavily ( something like more than # 5 billion a year afaik ) . 
  taking that on would be a hard sell in the roi , it 'd take quite a big water bill to pay for . 
  unfortunately , that would require the voluntary agreement of countries to abide by the result . 
  if a country is militarily far more powerful , but comparable or weaker in the `` game '' aspect , there is no way they would agree to it . 
  you can already see that when there is an offer of deciding a conflict through an international court case . 
  sure ideally , you would either use only accurate portrayals of real countries , or take artistic liberties with fictional countries ( eg [ pottsylvania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pottsylvania ) ) . 
  while if it was a ~ $ 5 million per episode hbo tv show sold globally , or a $ 100 million hollywood film , that would be different ; i just think you have unrealistic expectations of a domestic tv show . 
  however , it is also true for the reverse , it is hard to erase racism when society refuses to see it . 
  racists do n't need your census results to discriminate on race . 
  to give an example where recording race can reduce racism ; when applying/interviewing for jobs , the employer may have you fill in a seperate diversity form where you list details like your ; race , gender and disabilities , which is kept separately . 
  this provides evidence as to whether those interviewing applicants have a racial bias , if they disproportionately reject people from a minority group despite having equal or better qualifications than the successful , non-minority , applicants , this can be immediately shown by the records . 
  oh dear , do i really need to use / s to let people know i 'm not being serious . 
  i made that last sentence as sarcastic as possible to make sure everyone knew , i even used the word `` chaps '' for goodness sakes . 
  because before the eu was based there , the only interesting thing about belgium was that it was where the ; french , british and germans would settle things . 
  the poor chaps are running out of interesting things to put on their money , obviously . 
  bah , i wanted to see if we were going to do a circulated one as well . 
  unfortunately according to the royal mint , we are n't  [ `` the only official uk coin to mark the bicentenary '' ] ( http://www.royalmint.com/shop/200th_anniversary_of_waterloo_2015_uk_5_pound_bu ) they missed the same opportunity with trafalgar 10 years ago , although apparently gibraltar did mint a [ circulated # 2 coin for that ] ( http://colnect.com/en/coins/coin/6407-2_pounds_battle_of_trafalgar_1805-g70_-_two_pounds-gibraltar ) to make it doubly offensive to the spanish . 
  i wonder if a few decades from now , that islamic one-finger gesture thing will become so inextricably linked with violent fundamentalists , that it will be unacceptable in normal society . 
  eventually all those pictures of bearded psychopaths holding a severed head in one hand , and extending the index finger of the other are going to put people off . 
  sort of like how the [ `` roman salute '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_salute ) is now only known as the `` nazi salute '' after being adopted by fascists . 
  which was awkward for the usa , since it was the [ same as the one they used when making the pledge of allegiance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bellamy_salute ) . 
  sure , many among the western allies wanted to take germany apart so thoroughly it could n't threaten europe a third time , but they did n't . 
  [ oh , and it was englishman ivan hirst who helped save volkswagen ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/mar/18/guardianobituaries ) .

  op 's title had me interested ... ... and then the video starts with `` who do you think you are kidding , mr juncker ? '', 
  aw yis ... dis gon be gud !, 
  verhofstadt cameo as well , this is amazing !, 
  almost as good as westminster, 
  have an upvote , if that is your honest opinion , there 's no need for those who disagree with you to silence you . 
  that said , i disagree that us troops training the romanian armed forces is a threat to romanian sovereignty . 
  romania may not have the worlds finest army , but i 'm sure they could deal with a couple of hundred soldiers . 
  * it 's not time issues , it is the fact that germany had been under the impression that the greek reparations were covered by the [ london agreement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_agreement_on_german_external_debts ) , so the legal status of the greek claim is shaky . 
  germany is understandably wary about setting a precedent overturning the london agreement , as it may lead to further claims . 
  * as far as i am aware , in the west we are not demanding turkey pay reparations to ethnic armenians , but ask turkey to recognise that mass killings and deportations targeted at a specific ethnic minority , was genocide . 
  germany fully recognises its actions were genocidal , turkey does not . 
  unfortunately for us in the uk , since getting the saudis to buy our excess typhoons was all that saved the mod from running out of cash , it 'll be unlikely we 'll follow sweden , [ since they have us over a barrel . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-yamamah_arms_deal#threats_by_the_saudi_government ), 
  i am aware of that . 
  i just do n't like that kind of prediction based on extrapolation . 
  while it is true that germany 's demographics are less favourable than the uk 's , it seems likely that over 20 years germany could introduce policies to attract skilled migrants and even increase middle class birth rates . 
  conversely , the uk has significant issues with ; household , corporate , and national debt , as well as an ongoing balance of payments issue . 
  if this is not addressed , this could cause economic growth to stagnate just as surely as an ageing population , which could put off the migrants that are the reason that is the main reason that the uk 's population is young and rising in the first place . 
  i 'm sure the cebr is staffed by far more intelligent people than me , but that kind of long term prediction is inherently unpredictable . 
  i do n't think either of us will be getting there within a couple of decades . 
  germany 's population is something like ~ 25 % bigger than the uk 's and its economy is ~ 50 % bigger . 
  for germany 's economy to be surpassed by either france or the uk on that time-scale would require the government in berlin to be comically more incompetent than the ones in london and paris . 
  going by past record , this seems unlikely . 
  i 'm not gordon brown 's biggest fan by any means , but i quite liked that piece . 
  it is sadly true that in a future referendum , a lot will be down to how the two positions are framed , not about logical arguments . 
  i hope that the pro-union side is better run this time . 
  also , bonus lolz for `` massaging '' patriotic egos with everyone 's favourite extrapolation :  in a decade or two , as german population falls , britain will again become europe 's biggest , most powerful economy . 
  ohhh matron !, 
   the fire was the first of three conflagrations in the space of a week at mosques across sweden . 
  while it is good news that this particular case was n't an attack motivated by hate , it seems there was more than one incident . 
  it seems unlikely all of them were accidents . 
  i would n't say they are hated , but there is sometimes a little resentment because ( like luxembourg ) it is a quite wealthy country , and a large part of that wealth has come from the facilitation of tax avoidance , both personal ( the famous swiss bank accounts ) and corporate ( [ around 60 % of the worlds coffee is traded in switzerland despite not a bean growing there ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/29/switzerland-commodities-trading-political-cost ) ) , which is at the expense of other , poorer , countries . 
  op 's article is another accusation levelled at switzerland , a mercantile attitude to distasteful governments . 
  the most famous example , is their profitable dealings with nazi germany , [ including buying the gold looted by the nazis , and potentially also the gold `` harvested '' from concentration camp victims ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/100178.stm ), 
  [ except nato has already spent over fifty years doing the ground work for cooperation . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standardization_agreement )  ... ** among the hundreds of standardization agreements ( current total is just short of 1300 ) ** are those for calibres of small arms ammunition , map markings , communications procedures , and classification of bridges . 
  the majority of eu countries are either in nato , or at least train alongside nato countries , while being equipped with hardware designed to be sold to nato countries . 
  most of the barriers to an eu army are political rather than practical . 
  you are right that domestic arms industries of countries like ; germany , the uk , and france will fight tooth and nail against a full military union which will end their captive home market , but there is little to stop the eu nations armed forces working alongside each other in the near future . 
  the simple answer . 
  because the french are more likely than germany to take their ball and go home over language , and since they have arguably the best army in europe , a credible eu military needs them . 
  if anything , for most countries a fiscal union is a politically harder sell than deeper military cooperation , since it will have a lot greater impact on most people 's lives . 
  for countries with neither a significant military industry , or an independently expeditionary foreign-military policy , military integration should be relatively easy . 
  it might be for the best . 
  if serbia was in it , their contribution would probably end up lumped in with croatia 's . 
  i 'm not sure how well that would go ( ok , it 's a bad joke ) . 
  absolutely , but i 'm not sure at what age this is likely to cause a constructive outcome , and when it risks polarising muslims / non-muslims . 
  in the context of a class dealing with the issues of mockery of religion . 
  i am sceptical whether most school children will tackle the topic in a constructive way at that age when dealing directly with the material . 
  that 's the point , i think everyone can relate to the fact that a significant minority of people at school age wo n't deal with the issue sensitively . 
  as a former school student myself , i am not sure that school kids will treat this issue with the appropriate level of respect . 
  it 's not just about islam , i would feel similarly uncomfortable with a teacher showing clips of the life of brian in class , and i 'm an atheist . 
  yes , it is optional , and perhaps the issue can be tactfully tackled in the classroom , but you can bet that only non-muslim danish teachers teaching mostly non-muslim classes will tackle the issue . 
  on the plus side , if they are low spec laptops , it will make it less tempting for corrupt officers to sell them . 
  jokes aside , it makes sense for most countries to stick to non-lethal aid ( avoiding escalation with russia ) , but to help ukraine financially so it is able to procure warsaw pact weapons which its soldiers and logistics infrastructure are more familiar with . 
   meanwhile only between 7.5 to 15 percent of moldovans favour unity with romania - a figure which has remained the same for the past decade . 
  as usual , if an article has a question in the title , the answer is probably `` no '', 
  except that cigarettes were a currency , and currency = food . 
  i do see it regularly expressed that ruthless stalin was just what the ussr needed to fight germany , however his record sheet was not fantastic on this : * his purges crippled the ussr 's armed forces , both in the loss of competent officers , and the collapse of morale . 
  * the molotov-ribbentrop pact helped give the nazi 's the confidence to invade poland , a substantial country , without opening two fronts . 
  * stalin 's [ massacre of poland 's armed forces ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre ) , wasted a potential asset ( experienced polish pilots and soldiers made a substantial contribution to the western war effort , famously [ the polish 303 squadron was the best fighter squadron in the raf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no._303_polish_fighter_squadron ) ) . 
  * stalin 's shambolic 1939 invasion of finland , as well as costing the ussr over 300,000 casualties ( and many tanks & planes ) , and causing finland to ally with germany , also gave the nazis the confidence that the ussr could crumble when faced with a `` real '' enemy * stalin remained neutral even when the nazis were invaded the low countries and france . 
  germany feared having to fight on two fronts , stalin allowed germany to concentrate his forces on one front , and did nothing as france fell . 
  this allowed germany to bring all the captured equipment and the full weight of occupied europe 's industry to bear on one front against the ussr .
