  not only does nato have a 2 % gdp requirement , it has a 20 % of spending on equipment requirement . 
  barely anyone meets both . 
  combining compatible countries could help yield the economies of scale , like the us armed services has . 
  though yes , in reality , this will just be used as an excuse to cut spending further . 
  actually , britain is doing this with the americans already to an extent . 
  [ just last year they did a practice exercise for mixing 3 para with the 82nd airborne ] ( http://www.army.mil/article/150413/army_planning_more_combined_operations_with___/ ) , as a rehearsal for being able to fully combine the two when needed . 
  some capabilities , like airborne forces and tanks are very expensive to have a meaningful quantity of by yourself as a modestly sized country . 
  ... before puking all over you . 
  ** you 're my besht mate **, 
  [ actually , according to the inquest , they fucked up really badly , that was their second attempt ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/1527520/litvinenko-killed-after-second-poisoning ), 
  yeah ... perceptions will be affected by culture and language as well . 
  for example it seems suspect that ireland is ranked worse than ; moldova , russia , cambodia etc. 
  wealth transferred as part of an inheritance is taxed at 40 % over # 325,000 . 
  [ any money given by the person leaving the inheritance within the past 7 years is taxed on a tapering scale ] ( https://www.gov.uk/inheritance-tax/gifts ) . 
  i 'm actually genuinely surprised . 
  i would have thought she would rank hitler second after muhammed . 
  which is pretty much what happened with the sovereign debt crises . 
  the big euro economies like france ignored the deficit rules on the [ stability and growth pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stability_and_growth_pact ) , so countries like greece ignored them as well , and we 've ended up where we are today . 
  unfortunately , it 's hard to see what the us can do to encourage 2 % gdp defence spending . 
  there is no mechanism to penalise a country , and the consequences of failing to do so by their very nature are not an immediate thing . 
  germany could entirely dismantle their armed forces , and even withdraw from nato with no consequences , because it is surrounded on every side by friendly nato countries , and completely mooch off everyone else if it wanted to , and there is nothing anybody could do about it ( except possibly invade ) . 
  well , my problem is n't with the uk doing this ( although it would be nice to get a discount on the money sent to brussels for doing it ) . 
  i 'm just saying that it is n't a permanent solution to what is likely to be a long term problem . 
  most of the eu have experience working together militarily because of nato , it would be nice to see that leveraged to take on these kinds of simple tasks as a teamwork measure . 
  part of the reason i 'm skeptical of the uk taking this on is that the active uk armed forces are actually [ numerically the smallest of the biggest four eu economies , despite the largest spending ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel ) , because of an emphasis of spending going on diverse capabilities , especially for expeditionary warfare , rather than defensive war . 
  well , that would n't really be the development of an eu army , it would be the deployment of the british army wearing blue patches with stars on . 
  this would take the burden off the usa , but it is n't a permanent solution to the problem either . 
  in other posts in this thread i have advocated abandoning the eu battlegroup as a rapid response force concept ( because it is politically impossible without unified eu foreign policy , not because of the usa ) , and to re-purpose it as a border garrison force , where it could actually do some good . 
  i suppose the usa could help such a transition by providing aid in the form of discounted us hardware to forces deployed in this role in the medium term , since there are lots of poorer eu/nato countries which are struggling to modernise , and even second hand us kit will be a vast improvement for them . 
  the eu is divided on so many key issues ; russia & ukraine , migrant crisis , syrian civil war , greek debt crisis . 
  you ca n't blame the uk for this . 
  well , no one will want to pay for it , because the usa is doing it already for them . 
  it 's sad to say that the only realistic way this is going to happen is tough love from america . 
  there is no successful multinational rapid response force that i know of , simply because different nation states have different foreign policies , and reaching a consensus takes too long . 
  it is not a problem specifically with the eu , nato has experienced this problem , and the african union is slow to politically agree to deploy forces . 
  unless the eu had a single unified foreign policy ( which is not happening , and not just because of the uk ) , this will be a problem . 
  personally , i think europe should accept that there is no realistic use for a eu rapid response force , and instead focus military efforts on helping its border countries , which is something achievable . 
  by all means , blame the uk for stalling integration , but if you think the uk is responsible for the inability of the eu countries to work together quickly in a crisis , i 'm afraid you are mistaken . 
  right , because the political deployment speed is the bottleneck , not the logistical constraints . 
  just look at the near abroad in northern africa . 
  france intervened militarily with logistical support from allies , west african ebola epidemic 2014 ? 
  us & uk deployed forces bilaterally with liberia & sierra leone respectively . 
  central african republic civil war ? 
  france responded quickly , and when the eu did deploy forces , [ it was a different force under a different organisational structure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eufor_rca ) the idea of a rapidly deployable force , which requires the consensus of the eu to be deployed , is an oxymoron . 
  [ those eu battlegroups were supposed to be used to respond to problems worldwide , not in the eu ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/esdp/91624.pdf ) what situations are they supposed to be used in then ? 
  the uk could definitely play a role , especially now that personnel commitments in iraq/afghanistan are over . 
  however , it need n't be one country , or the same country at all times . 
  what would make it simpler would be if there was money allocated that would pay out to countries deploying garrison forces based on the size and capability of their commitment . 
  countries would be far more keen to deploy their forces for defending the eu borders if they got money to offset the cost . 
  southern european countries struggling to afford their defence spending might even be able to use this money ( should it get funded by brussels ) to avoid having to cut army size further . 
  that is the very point , what is the point in having a rapid reaction force , when the politics to deploy them is anything but rapid ? 
  in the ten years of the eu battlegroups , they have not been deployed once , despite numerous small crises . 
  instead either individual nation states or ad hoc cooperation has been used to deal with these situations . 
  there is persistent short-sightedness . 
  the euro monetary-without-fiscal-union problem was ignored until the financial crisis , the schengen no-internal-borders-external-countries-deal-with-it issue was ignored until the migrant crisis , and you can bet that when ( not if ) the usa is done with paying for europe 's defence , nothing will be done about it until there is a conflict-crisis . 
  these battlegroups have never been used because there is n't the political will to deploy them abroad . 
  if they are going to be deployed in the eu , why not put them somewhere useful and scale them up as required . 
  permanent bases would n't politically be a problem ( the baltic states would be happy to have such a long term commitment ) , and if the forces are rotated , then no one nation bears the burden . 
  the truly difficult part would be the funding for it . 
  as long as the usa is willing to foot the bill , there is no will to do it . 
  yes , both russia and nato make shows of force for the benefit of their own citizens . 
  i 'm not saying that estonia should be abandoned , i 'm saying that the forces could be eu rather than nato . 
  american troops defending europe 's borders should not be the long term answer to the problem . 
  [ what about these ones that are n't doing anything ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_battlegroup ), 
  perhaps it could be a use for those pointless [ eu battlegroups ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_battlegroup ) that have never been deployed abroad , and will probably never be deployed abroad because of politics . 
  use them to reassure and secure the countries on the eastern borders of europe , an actually useful deployment . 
  i suppose forbidden was too strong a word to use . 
  controversial might be more appropriate . 
  it just seems undiplomatic to keep us troops on the russian border . 
  perhaps in the current situation it is part of the pressure on russia linked to the sanctions , but in the long term it is not ideal . 
  it just seems ridiculous to me that the usa is being expected to garrison the borders of the eu , when it is both the furthest away , and the most provocative to russia of the possible countries to do the job . 
  sure , the risk is small , but these countries would like some sort of tripwire force . 
  i was just wondering if it were possible to have forces from eu member countries under an eu flag providing this reassurance without the perceived disrespect to russia , not the creation of a eu army . 
  most news articles i have read on the issue seem to claim that the 1997 nato-russia founding act made promises that nato would not permanently station forces in the former warsaw pact . 
  though i ca n't said i have read the document myself . 
  just to ask a question : why ca n't the eu expand on its own [ mutual defence clause ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/mutual_defence.html ) , and station eu troops instead of us troops in the baltic countries and eastern poland as a permanent border garrison ? 
  it is only nato forces that are forbidden from being permanently stationed in eastern europe . 
  excluding vat # 1947 only goes down to # 1622.50 , the current exchange rate ( which is the worst it has been in years , fyi ) would make $ 1800 about # 1281 . 
  so , even without vat , that is more than 25 % more pricey in the uk than the us . 
  that said , it 's a different trade area , so of course prices will be different . 
  should keep this on topic that intra eu price differences are the problem . 
  [ it probably has a lot to do with the cet zone being far bigger than one hour . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_european_time ) spain are on the very western edge of the time zone , while hungary is on the very eastern edge . 
  it seems that spain stays in the same timezone as the rest of europe , but actually works more like they 're on gmt ( like the uk , ireland and portugal ) . 
  edit : just checked sunrise & sunset times for madrid and budapest today . 
  madrid is 0710-1932 , budapest is 0536-1804 . 
  so yeah , more than an hour different ( even allowing for latitude as well as longitude ) . 
   in a statement the imam said the messages had been taken out of context . 
   he said that he was expressing his opposition to capital punishment . 
  reaaaaaaaaaally ? 
   in further messages , the imam refers to qadri as `` brother '' and says that , by killing his employer whom he was paid to protect , he was `` carrying out the collective responsibility of the ummat , '' or muslims as a whole . 
  so , execution for murder is bad , but execution for suggesting execution for blasphemy is bad is good . 
  seems simple enough in context !, 
  nobody on / r/europe can speak for all europeans . 
  i would n't say it was likely you will be attacked based on your race or perceived religion , but you might just run into someone who will attack you . 
  there are no guarantees . 
  that said , it is pretty unlikely . 
  the only thing i would regard as risky is late night around people who have had a bit to drink , in a dodgy part of town . 
  women with hair or face covered get it worst afaik , because most bigots like an easy target .
