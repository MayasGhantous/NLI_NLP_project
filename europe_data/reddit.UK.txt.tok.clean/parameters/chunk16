  i would n't think the beard makes much difference , i 'm sure a smile and an australian accent will make up for it . 
  right , the usa spends 3.5 % of gdp on their military . 
  the nato target is 2 % , little more than half proportionately . 
  many countries are closer to 1 % . 
  sounds fair enough  many stations have resorted to repeating the same songs ad nauseam , with the culture ministry saying in september that only 10 songs accounted for 74 per cent of the french titles aired on nrj radio , and 67 per cent of those broadcast on another station , which has the english-sounding name skyrock . 
   ... but the concession comes with a condition : stations ** will have to air more new french songs ** as the country 's culture minister , audrey azoulay , said : `` this is a balanced solution . '' the purpose of the quota is to help new contemporary francophone music get heard . 
  if they 're just playing the same old songs day in day out , then nobody is happy . 
  in britain , what [ john peel did for new british acts in the 80s and 90s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_peel#punk_era ) shows the power of a radio dj with an ear for new talent . 
  that said , new acts are nowhere near as dependant on radio to get heard , with the internet . 
  [ actually , the south east has got pretty nice weather ] ( http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/average-annual-precipitation/map_5_1_annual_precip.eps/image_large ) though , i 'll admit the places with all the best landscapes get crappy weather .

  huh , i knew that the age of 10 for criminal responsibility was low , but i did n't know how much higher it was in most of europe . 
  i ca n't imagine england 's age of criminal responsibility rising any time soon . 
  the idea we could have a crime like the [ murder of james bulger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_of_james_bulger ) go unpunished would send the press into a frenzy, 
  [ presumably it is including london 's metropolitan area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_metropolitan_areas_in_the_united_kingdom ), 
  well , it very possibly could have had a decisive impact . 
  as is often cited , the biggest risk for britain in the war was the u-boat siege . 
  if ireland was as fully mobilised for food production like britain , and hosted asw air and sea patrols as far west as possible , it could have made an important contribution , beyond simple manpower . 
  my main point was to say , entering the war for ireland carried a large possibility of civil strife , without an important reason to want to take that risk . 
  with ww2 , so much of it is hindsight . 
  the concrete proof of the scale of crimes in nazi occupied europe only came as the camps were liberated , documents captured , and witnesses were interviewed at the end of the war . 
  whereas the actions of the ric special reserve and the auxiliary division were well known . 
  not hard to see it might have been difficult to convince many in ireland they should help the uk , both pro and anti treaty . 
  besides , the americans have n't got a leg to stand on in this issue , it took pearl harbour for them to get fully involved . 
  [ yeah , and then the `` artist '' wanted her cut ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/20/ecce-homo-cecilia-gimenez-royalties ) the whole story was amazing , start to finish .

  british guy here and in my opinion westminster had decades to bring about genuine home rule . 
  [ gladstone tried in 1886 ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/irish_home_rule_speech ) , and ideally it would have happened . 
  the events thirty years later can be laid at the feet of those who stopped that bill and all other attempts , not those who rose up . 
  the ww2 neutrality is understandable considering the wounds of the ; war of independence , the civil war , and the situation with the north , were n't resolved . 
  this is amazing !, 
   ** two military cadets , ivan tsaritsyn and petr tikhogromov , are sent to scotland , where they 're meant to infiltrate the `` higher academy of occult sciences . '' ** their mission is to find five russian orphans who traveled abroad to study at the wizard school . 
  instead of returning home , however ( to their orphanages ) , these children `` began to have a negative attitude toward russia . '' ivan and petr are charged with discovering why they turned against their homeland . 
  it 's like hogwarts is real , but is in fact a secret nato research facility , set up by nazis . 
  i would watch the shit out of this film !, 
  ok , just finished reading op 's article , and apparently the book the film is based on was literally a piece of patriotic russian harry potter fan fiction . 
  that is a genre of writing which i feel has been neglected to this date , so i am glad it is getting the recognition it deserves . 
  actually , the south of britain is sinking and the north rising . 
  not due to buildings of course , but as a [ correction from the last ice age ] ( http://planetearth.nerc.ac.uk/news/story.aspx?id=555&amp;cookieconsent=a ), 
  the only country the uk has a land border with has passport free travel . 
  maybe if you 're a really frequent flyer it sucks , but honestly it ` sa small price to pay for your own border control . 
  the french & italian equivalent of the [ type 45 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_45_destroyer ) is the [ horizon class ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horizon-class_frigate ) . 
  whereas the ship in op is the [ asw variant of the fremm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fremm_multipurpose_frigate ) . 
  frigates are , yes , usually general purpose vessels often with an emphasis on asw . 
  the next uk frigate will be the [ type 26 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_combat_ship ) , a general purpose ship with emphasis on asw which they are hoping to make eight of , accompanied by a new cheaper general purpose type 31 frigate ( this was originally going to be a type 26 with less equipment , but it now seems they 're going to make a new smaller ship instead ) . 
  in the earlier years of the civil war , the uk joined france and the us in giving favoured , non-radical islamist factions non-lethal aid like ; medical supplies , communication equipment , and intelligence . 
  however , the aid from the uk to these groups was a relatively minor thing , and as far as i am aware , with the rise to prominence of islamist groups this aid has not been expanded on . 
  these kinds of maps it is not as simple as pointing at the colours , remember isis used to not only be part of the rebel forces , it used to be part of al-nusra ( the syria al-qaeda franchise ), 
  how exactly has the uk escalated the syria/iraq conflict ? 
  as far as i can tell , almost all action has been to support the iraqi government in containing and reversing the expansion of isis since last year , with in the past few months a handful of air strikes on isis in syria . 
  even ignoring the humanitarian contribution of the uk , it seems to me that if anything the uk has helped reduce the numbers of displaced persons . 
  no idea for two reasons . 
  * the true capabilities of the s-400 and the f-35 are jealously guarded secrets , so the public can only speculate . 
  an informed opinion on this is impossible . 
  * by the time the f-35 is deployed in europe in numbers large enough to make a difference (  5 years ) , the s-400 may have received upgrades that erode the f-35 's advantages . 
  what we do know , is that almost all of the aircraft available to nato in europe in the medium term are 4th generation aircraft that the latest russian sams have been specifically designed to counter . 
  this does n't mean that aircraft wo n't be able to operate at all , just that their effectiveness will be diminished as long as russian sams are operational . 
  large numbers of long range sam systems like the s-300 and s-400 ( up to ~ 400 km or ~ 250 mi range ) deployed in layers in western russia and kaliningrad oblast could prevent nato air power from supporting their ground forces effectively , where russia 's local ground superiority could then defeat nato forces in the baltic states . 
  i do n't think war is likely , but if it did happen , nato can not depend on air power as the answer . 
  it 's a genius plan really , first we lure em all over with jobs , then we all buy cheap holiday homes in donegal and connacht , right , and i do n't know what comes next , but i 'll have a pint first then think about it . 
  oi oi , do n't be premature , you 've got to make it another five to get to the 100 year anniversary of the anglo-irish treaty , a lot can happen in five years with a conservative government !, 
  calling it `` shakira law '' should tip you off that there is an invisible '' / s '' at the end . 
  it was a charity football match and he was on for a few minutes near the end . 
  that `` clown '' is the current mayor of london , possibly the soon to be foreign secretary , in the running for becoming leader of the conservative party , and so possibly prime minister in 2020 . 
  [ obligatory boris johnson clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwiup19bboa ), 
  best troll , it offends everyone except london . 
  the biggest difference was propulsion . 
  a large sailing ship 's average speed is relatively low anyway . 
  ships going from europe first had to sail south to around the canary islands to catch the prevailing east to west winds , then they were at the mercy of the weather as to how fast their passage was . 
  in the 1830s steam ( paddle ) ships were introduced , which did not depend on the wind . 
  as the propulsion was improved ( better steam engines , hull design , moving from paddles to propellers to better propellers ) so did the times . 
  [ the `` blue riband '' was the record for westward journey from europe to north america , you can see the progress of the record crossing times over the 19th and early 20th centuries . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_riband#list_of_record_breakers ) it goes from nearly 16 days in 1830 , to 3.5 days in 1950 . 
  in 1914 the record was about 4.5 days . 
  yeah , it has to be an attempt to get a better deal from someone . 
  i ca n't imagine turkey spending enough to develop a full air defense system from scratch that is comparable to contemporary systems . 
  i can only presume that once the tranche 1 and early tranche 2 typhoons are being retired , they will be replaced with more capable later block f-35a aircraft in 15-20 years , while the earlier and most heavily used f-35b will also be retired from the raf , and mostly just the rn 's faa will be operating them . 
  the delivery date for the full number of f-35 aircraft will be well after the tornado 's ( already delayed ) retirement date , so there definitely needs to be a stop-gap measure . 
  the uk is currently only planning on getting the [ f-35b ( stovl ) variant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_martin_f-35_lightning_ii#specifications_.28f-35a.29 ) . 
  this variant has a relatively shorter range and payload than the a&c . so the typhoon may still be needed for some missions . 
  also , the uk 's number of fast jets is smaller , so every jet must be multirole . 
  a dedicated interceptor/fighter aircraft would be an extravagance . 
  afaik the raf is spending a lot of money trying to get their tranche 2 & 3 typhoons fully upgraded for ground attack by 2018 ( ish ) in time for the tornado 's ( delayed ) retirement . 
  however , i do n't know if germany is making similar investments, 
  a few arguments ( i 'm sure others can add to this ) : * germany only borders other nato countries ( apart from the swiss ) , and does not have any interests outside europe ( like france and the uk ) so it is easy to be complacent about danger , and the military has become far less important . 
  * germany 's political culture is relatively pacifist . 
  the politicians are not expected to take part in major foreign ventures , and the military is not a priority for voting citizens . 
  * germany 's armed forces are sort of in transition from a large conscription based army to a smaller more professional one , [ conscription only ended fully in 2011 ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-world-from-berlin-end-of-an-era-as-germany-suspends-conscription-a-737668.html ) . 
  as such , personnel costs are still eating up a lot of their shrunken military budget that would otherwise be spent on maintaining and updating their equipment . 
  germany is scaling down from ~ 240,000 servicemen to ~ 170,000 , for comparison the uk with a military budget about ~ 50 % higher than germany 's in absolute terms only has about ~ 150,000 full time personnel . 
  masoud barzani , the leader of the kdp group and president of the krg is very turkey friendly . 
  the kdp and turkey have certainly been friendly since the [ iraqi kurdish civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_kurdish_civil_war ), 
  the amraam missiles used have an effective range of around 100 km . 
  the turkish f-16s could have shot down the russian aircraft from well within turkish territory . 
  [ last week a us soldier was awarded the medal of honor for just that . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/13/us/politics/medal-of-honor-awarded-to-army-captain-who-tackled-bomber-in-afghanistan.html?_r=0 ) if a bomber is heading toward a large group of people , and you do n't mind laying your life down for others , it might make sense . 
  however , no one should be expected to do it . 
  presumably as security guards they were n't trained or equipped to take down a suicide bomber , so they called the police to deal with it . 
  sure , they could have tried tackling the guy , but honestly i ca n't blame them for looking after themselves . 
  several of the terrorists have a history of involvement with violent criminals who do have access to guns .
