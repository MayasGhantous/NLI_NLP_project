  it seems to me that this overlap between armed criminals and jihadists is part of the reason why france has been having more problems with islamist terror attacks than other european countries . 
  ah my sympathies , i hope you get in contact with them soon . 
  yes , they do not identify as french , but rather as a member of a fantasy pan-islamic state . 
  however , the fact remains that there is no easy target for revenge . 
  that 's what i 'm saying , it 's likely that the attackers were if not french by birth , french by their country of residence . 
  unfortunately , it is likely that the perpetrators were if not born in france , at least long term residents of france , and most of the planning may have been done by them in france . 
  in which case , who do you invoke it against ? 
  even if it was plotted in syria , is is already crumbling under recent assaults in both iraq and syria , and is likely to lose all its territory within the next two years , perhaps even one year . 
  however , after that , the war will be on the idea of `` islamic state '' , which is harder to do with weapons . 
  except raki pre-dates the republic of turkey , and for much of the 20th century was even produced by a government-owned company , tekel . 
  raki is part of turkish culture , and it is absolutely newsworthy in the context of turkey 's changing relationship between government and religion . 
  someone at the i100 has a sense of humour , we have this passage . 
   in the past , front national has been accused of fielding `` racist , bizarre and geriatric candidates '' , and despite le pen 's newfound middle-ground rhetoric , ** there are still fears that an `` authoritarian , nationalist , anti-immigrant and anti-european '' worldview lies underneath . 
  ** with a picture of david cameron gurning below ... 
  not here !, 
  can confirm , south east england is full of smug bastards :d, 
  there are plenty of people in the uk opposed to joining the eurozone or schengen area , who do not support an eu exit . 
  while it 's perfectly possible he secretly wants the uk to leave . 
  it should be noted that despite no longer being in the cabinet ( and so bound by collective cabinet responsibility ) [ he is apparently still publicly speaking supportively about david cameron 's negotiations with the eu , and expressing hope the uk stays in the eu ] ( https://www.politicshome.com/party-politics/articles/story/risk-brexit-overestimated-william-hague ) . 
  not only that , but it does n't seem like this particular saudi has done anything reprehensible ( apart from being a prominent saudi ) . 
  literally all this `` article '' is , is mentioning that a guy has been appointed as a diplomat for a small nation , and then listing lots of terrible things the country saudi arabia does . 
  rt may sometimes bring up issues the british establishment does n't cover , but this article is a complete mess . 
  wait , i just showed you that even with the `` unique rebate '' the uk is still probably the second largest eu contributor , what are you talking about . 
  and please , the reason this was pointed out at all in this comment thread was a reply to a post with the attitude that the uk asking for anything from the eu was arrogant and unreasonable because the uk `` gives nothing '' . 
  leaving aside for the moment your assertion that the apolitical uk civil service is biased , but the eu civil service is not . 
  it appears that much of this difference is due to a difference in the counting of the use of private sector services head-quartered in the uk ( technical annex page 33 ) . 
  the uk does not count this , but the eu does, 
   i 'm not u/redh _ , but you just proved his point . 
  on page twelve of your link , it shows that uk is fourth behind germany , france and italy after rebates for 2014 . 
  you will note that on that pie chart countries like romania appear , which are not ( to my knowledge ) net contributors to the eu . 
  which suggests that chart is gross contribution , but with the rebate applied to the uk 's portion . 
  yes , the burden should be better represented by population and economy being factored in , but the point remains that the uk is near the top in terms of net contribution . 
   keep spreading the misinformation pleb . 
  ** you mean 4th largest contribution . 
  ** i will assume you being british is that you have no clue of the british financial relationship with the eu . 
  ** read up on the british rebate . 
  ** can i ask where you are getting your data from ? 
  [ using a official uk treasury report on eu finances from 2014 ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/388882/eu_finances_2014_final.pdf ) , you can see the net contributions for the years 2011 and 2012 shown as being second in the eu on page 16 , if you then turn to page 17 , you can see that the net contribution data used for that graph has had the uk rebate already deducted . 
  the uk would not be the only one to benefit , it might benefit the most , but is hardly likely to capture all the business everywhere , for example in areas like law ( where the uk differs significantly to the continent in many ways ) . 
  that and the increased competition will force local service businesses to offer better prices or quality of service . 
  this will benefit the consumers of those services all over europe . 
  male-male sex accounts for [ 44 % of hiv infections ] ( http://www.nat.org.uk/hiv-in-the-uk/hiv-statistics/latest-uk-statistics/people-with-hiv-in-uk.aspx ) in the uk despite men who have sex with other men being ~ 1 % of the uk 's population . 
  it really is just about risk factors . 
  [ for example , women who have had sex with a man who has sex with men are excluded ] ( http://www.blood.co.uk/giving-blood/who-cant-give-blood/ ) , because though heterosexual , they are in an `` at risk '' group . 
  you do n't get paid , so presumably those giving blood are all doing it out of a charitable duty . 
  i do n't really think there is any reason to lie about it when asked . 
  or , on the other hand , when arrests and prosecutions are made , or attacks disrupted in early stages they are n't as publicly noted events . 
  there needs to be a balance between false positives and false negatives . 
  knowing that someone has extremist sympathies is one thing , proving that they are about to commit a crime is another . 
  over the same period of time that you point to two successful domestic terror attacks in the uk ( the most recent of which , the attack on lee rigby was a low-preparation attack ) , there have been [ hundreds of people charged with terror offences over the last decade ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34206326 ) . 
  i do n't know what the correct surveillance laws are to have , but choosing to only focus on a small number of false negatives is more than a little misleading . 
  if you are concerned about injustice , you should focus on the false positives . 
  well , the same was true in so much of europe over the same period of history , the religious element of the thirty years war , and other persecutions like that of the huguenots in france pitted otherwise culturally similar people against each other with mutual suspicion and hate . 
  there were multiple catholic plots against elizabeth i and of course the famous gunpowder plot against james i ( vi ) to try and bring about a catholic monarchy . 
  there was plenty of other schemes and plots over the next centuries from both sides , very often with foreign powers involved . 
  honestly though , the big difference is that today we just ca n't quite comprehend how important religion was to people then . 
  how central the church was to your life . 
  it may seem a frivilous concern today but being the right sort of christian was deadly serious . 
  `` wonky fruit '' refers to the belief that eu regulations are causing waste by having to comply with unreasonable standards ( though afaik in the case of the waste of un-aesthetically pleasing fruit , the reason is more the demands of the consumer ) . 
  human rights refers the uk 's 1998 human rights act . 
  this is the implementation of the european convention on human rights . 
  while not actually part of the eu , the echr is blamed for court rulings that outrage many people , [ for example when it was used to rule in support of plane hijackers not being deported ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_afghan_hijackers_case ) . 
  [ here is an article that talks through the issues point by point ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/1490875/human-rights-act-what-you-need-to-know ) . 
  it 's quite a sensitive subject to some people , and discussions on it quite often break down to simplistic cries of `` they 're trying to take away our rights ! '', 
  against `` this law protects terrorists ! '', 
  instead of being rational , unfortunately . 
   yes , a poor economy . 
  so you are agreeing that a monetary union like the erm or eurozone can lead to a poor economy ? 
  or are you saying that a economy doing poorly reveals the fundamental problem with a monetary union ? 
  the uk was in recession while in the erm , and then shortly after leaving it experienced a long period of growth , [ see figure 2 ] ( http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/elmr/explaining-economic-statistics/long-term-profile-of-gdp-in-the-uk/sty-long-term-profile-of-gdp.html ) the uk experienced in 1992 the reality of being in a monetary union with different economies , of other self-interested countries . 
  the bundesbank could have helped the uk by expanding the bands ( like it did for france among others in 1993 ) , devaluing its own currency , or not talking to the press about how it was n't going to do anything to help the uk . 
  germany was not wrong to do what it did , but it was a wake up call to anyone here who imagined that there would be solidarity in a crisis ( as greece knows today ) . 
  are you aware that the erm was a precursor to the eurozone , and not a british instigated policy ? 
   [ the european exchange rate mechanism ( erm ) was a system introduced by the european economic community on 13 march 1979 , as part of the european monetary system ( ems ) , to reduce exchange rate variability and achieve monetary stability in europe , ** in preparation for economic and monetary union and the introduction of a single currency , the euro , ** which took place on 1 january 1999 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_exchange_rate_mechanism ) black wednesday was in fact one of the reasons the uk did not want to join the euro , because we had already experienced the problems of monetary union . 
  with the recent experiences of southern europe , this seems like it was a reasonable decision . 
  congratulations on proving the opposite point . 
  what the hell ... 
  it looks like the result of the ecb having a `` bring your child to work day '' . 
  [ apparently it is in fact the work of a greek guy working for the bank of greece , whose design won an online poll . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/articles/euro/article11072_en.htm ) now , i 've got to say [ the other designs are n't that inspired either ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/the_euro/10yearcoin/home_en.htm# ) but i still prefer them to the winner . 
  there are some angry irishmen on the internet ( and scots or americans who are angry on ireland 's behalf ) , but seriously , most of the `` sniping '' from the irish on the internet or face to face is no worse than ribbing over the six nations and objections to certain british politicians ( who are controversial here as well ) . 
  sweeping statements of irish hate for england / britain today is overblown really , especially since most young people do n't remember the troubles so keenly . 
  no , there are islamist groups active in the sinai that have carried out terror attacks recently , but it is nothing like the lawless areas of syria or libya . 
  apparently whatever happened to the plane happened around `` 31,000 feet '' well above the range of aaa and manpads , and there is no plausible scenario for islamist groups to have obtained a large sam weapon system . 
  basically , it is very unlikely to be a terror attack , and if it was , it would probably have to be a person or bomb already on the plane . 
  one thing to remember is that the uk has often played the role in the eu as the loud-mouth opposed to ever closer integration and the euro 's encroachment on the rest of the eu . 
  with the uk gone , someone else might need to take this role , which has n't had to yet . 
  sweden is a plausible country to speak up for non-eurozone countries interests , though it would be more dependant on support from others than the uk . 
  in a couple of months they 'll start wheeling out the heads of the big banks to warn they 'll all have to move their business to ~ ~ england ~ ~ europe if the out side wins . 
  it 's also possible america is actually saying this publicly as a favour to the british government . 
  remember the government wants an `` in '' not an `` out '' result , and the ongoing greece and migrant issues are imperiling that . 
  getting some downsides to leaving the eu in the news is good for cameron . 
  i just dislike the use of simple categories , putting a country in the same category as either switzerland or somalia , there are too many ways to judge a country to do that . 
  from my point of view , turkey has greatly developed economically , and has enjoyed far greater political stability in recent years . 
  the problem is a creeping return of authoritarian government wearing a new face . 
  a simple negative term like `` third world '' is going to offend the patriotic before you 've had a chance to explain your concerns . 
  the phrase third world has taken a different meaning from its original meaning . 
  [ it originally spoke of the cold war allegiance of a country , so turkey was a `` first world '' country . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/cold_war_alliances_mid-1975.svg ) it is a shame that turkey 's prosperity and peace is in danger of regressing , however .
