  the unusual thing about this review is the large reduction in number of seats ( 650 -  600 ) , however , even after the reduction the house of commons still has a comparable number of representatives for its population to other european lower houses . 
  a quick look at wikipedia shows : french national assembly : 577 german bundestag : 630 italian chamber of deputies : 630, 
  afaik the uk has not supplied weapons to the syrian civil war , and has only supplied limited numbers of weapons to the iraqi peshmerga ( which admittedly is a future iraqi civil war risk ) . 
  the big criticism at the moment is not about non-state groups , but mainly the ongoing supply of air-dropped munitions to the ksa , despite the allegedly excessive civilian casualties caused by the saudi-led coalition 's air campaign , which is a fair criticism . 
  what should be noted is that ksa has a policy of making diverse defence purchases , in large part to protect themselves from being cut off by their weapons suppliers for political reasons ; ( apart from corruption ) this is why the rsaf operates the european tornado & typhoon at the same time as the american f-15e & f-15c , despite those aircraft more or less duplicating the same roles respectively . 
  rip gold-shirt-man :(, 
  the trouble is that what looks like inefficiency from the point of view of defence capability delivered per $ spent , is actually money spent supporting domestic industry from the point of view of that country . 
  uk warship orders are basically decided on what is needed to keep domestic shipbuilding alive , not on delivering best value for money for the mod budget . 
  i presume it is similar elsewhere in europe . 
  getting eu national governments to accept the losses of thousands of jobs and a prestige industry will not be easy , even without the uk spoiling things . 
  iirc , turkey had a minutes silence at a football international after the paris attacks ( which was reported on here because some turkish fans did not observe it ) . 
  in that case it was nothing to do with turkey , but it was done . 
  it seems odd not to return the gesture just half a year later . 
  as a ukip politician , his voters are implicitly for the uk leaving the eu , so working to bring that about ( which he did ) is representing them . 
  it 's not that exceptional either , sinn f\u00e9in mps are elected but then r [ efuse to take their seats in westminster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abstentionism#in_northern_ireland ) , because they do not recognise its authority . 
  remember it is n't just the number of visitors , it 's how much they pay . 
  if there is oversupply , then prices fall . 
  if tourism businesses are having to discount at what should be peak season , their business is in trouble , even if visitor numbers seem healthy . 
  if you are arguing about the `` fairness '' of it , sure per capita is the way to go , but the point here is how big a hole in the eu budget does the uk leaving cause which must be filled by spending cuts or contribution raises from the rest of the countries . 
  in this case , the total net amount is what matters . 
  the fact that countries like ; denmark , belgium , sweden and luxembourg have larger net contributions per capita is irrelevant in this context , as the uk 's net contribution is larger than those four put together ( from what i can see ) . 
  i believe so , unless someone else knows otherwise . 
  the house of commons has already [ removed most hereditary peers from the house of lords ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_lords_act_1999#membership_of_the_house_of_lords ) . 
  if the government wanted to officially remove the powers from the queen , they could probably do so . 
  the eu needs to import vast quantities of oil and gas , far more than can be supplied by neutral neighbours like norway or algeria . 
  europe is hardly stopping imports from russia , [ it is still the biggest energy supplier to the eu ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/energy_production_and_imports#imports ) , and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future . 
  as long as europe needs to import such vast quantities of oil & gas , it will be supporting the export price for iran . 
  not to mention that the worlds biggest exporter ( ksa ) is if anything worse than iran in terms of human rights abuses , as well as also contributing to the length and viciousness of the syrian civil war . 
  there is n't an easy choice to make with who you buy energy from . 
  also , a smaller plane will ( all else being equal ) have a smaller and less powerful radar array . 
  this may more than offset any advantage in size , with regards to detection range for air to air combat between two different aircraft . 
   how can one defend an attack by a nation armed with nuclear weapons without nuclear weapons themselves ? 
  you are basically forced to budge at the threat of using nukes because you can not reciprocate in kind . 
  since the post ww2 nuclear taboo came about , no nuclear armed country has used nuclear weapons , even against an opponent who can not retaliate in kind . 
  for example the usa did n't use them in the korean war , the vietnam war , either war with iraq or against serbia over bosnia & kosovo , the uk did n't use them in the falklands war , israel did n't use them in the 1973 or 1982 wars . 
  the taboo in the use of nuclear weapons is at this point so strong it is unlikely a country would use them unless its own existence was threatened . 
  while russia does have a first use policy , in reality it is unlikely it would actually use it unless a superior enemy conventional force was attacking deep into russia . 
  a conventional deterrent is probably enough . 
  [ i suppose depending on your point of view , it could be longer than that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendum_party ), 
  not true , although the t-14 armata is the heaviest russian mbt yet , it is still apparently less than 50t . 
  meaning , not only are most modern nato mbts more than 10t heavier , but that means it is still lighter than the american m60 ( introduced ~ 1961 ) , or even the british centurion ( introduced ~ 1946 ) . 
  it 's not just the leopard 2 . 
  it 's a different design philosophy . 
  all the late cold war designed ussr 's tanks were 40-45 tonnes , whereas nato tanks are 50-65 tonnes, 
   you could say the same about any target , though . 
  not really , fixed wing aircraft are more vulnerable than most hardware , because they must be sited with a runway big enough for them to take off and land , and with the facilities to maintain , refuel and rearm them . 
  on the other hand ; artillery , armour , and sams can all be dispersed in woodland and camouflaged against air/missile strikes far more easily . 
   what truly worries me , is the fact for the past 10 years , we 've been following the infamous 2 % guideline yet our bang for buck spending has been absolutely appalling . 
  i guess a big part of that is that [ estonia has a military budget around 1 % that of the uk or france ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_01/20160129_160128-pr-2016-11-eng.pdf#page=5 ) , so of course it ca n't afford specialised equipment , and lacks the economies of scale larger countries have . 
  estonia simply ca n't really afford a full set of specialised equipment alone . 
  it would either need to group together with its neighbours to share it , or get generous military aid from other nato countries . 
  true , but since the us ( and soon the uk & germany ) are basing rotating ground forces as well , the baltics need ground forces as well , and those are simpler to introduce . 
  the only way i can see a cost effective baltic air force is if they come to an arrangement with the polish air force for economies of scale . 
  sure , i do n't care what they spend the money on particularly , i just think that advanced fast jets are pretty bad value for small countries . 
  yep , if deficit spending is helping our neighbour out , that 's fine by us . 
  the fact we get to make snarky comments on the topic about both the eu and france makes the whole thing a pleasant turn of events for us , if anything . 
  the costs are sufficiently different to be almost a given at this point . 
  the typhoon is notoriously expensive , and while a capable aircraft , it is probably a bit much for one of the smaller economies of the eu . 
  the only possibility is if one of the current operators is looking to offload some of theirs for a discount , rather than new aircraft . 
  the gripen is designed for exactly this niche of being a mid range alternative . 
  in many respects it 's nearly as good as one of the big jets , but cheaper to buy and operate . 
  the f-22 is n't for sale , not to anyone , and it is no longer in production anyway . 
  to be fair , the baltics are better served by investing in their ground forces as a deterrent to all scales of conflict . 
  if they did club together to buy a squadron of fighter jets , in an actual war they would be destroyed on the ground in the opening moments since they are so close to russia . 
  at most , a modest sam capability would be the best value . 
  yes , the v1 , v2 and v3 programs were all monumental follies . 
  the fact they only really got going after the ; battle of kursk , the exit of italy from the war , and the normandy landings , meant the axis was already losing conclusively in the ; east , south , and west . 
  then again , if that same resources had been used on conventional armaments , the war might have gone on longer , and cost more lives . 
  so perhaps in the end , it was for the best . 
  for those who do n't know , v2 were supersonic ballistic missiles , so there was no sound and no warning . 
  terrifying in its own way that any moment one could hit . 
  fortunately , there were n't that many , double agents guided them away from the densest population areas , and the government kept their existence quiet . 
  right , but my point is that when most advanced weapon systems have a service life cost in the billions , it is actually difficult for them to get what you regard as basic necessities , without some sort of military aid . 
  [ table 2 shows that the defence spending of estonia is $ 467 million usd all three baltic countries combined is around $ 1.1 billion usd ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_01/20160129_160128-pr-2016-11-eng.pdf#page=5 ) . 
  just maintaining what they have and paying wages probably does n't leave much to spend on new weapons systems . 
  page three shows how much of spending is going on equipment . 
  so yes , they are underspending on equipment compared to what they are supposed to ( 20 % of spending ) , but even if they were , it would only be a few tens of millions to spend on new equipment . 
  to be fair to the baltics , they ca n't really afford those kinds of specialised defence systems . 
  [ france 's economy is around a hundred times the size of estonia 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union#economies_of_member_states ) , so even though estonia is spending 2 % of gdp on defence as it is supposed to , its military spending is still around a hundredth of france 's . 
  to me , the only workable common army would be in effect an eastern europe defence force organised along a british army style regimental system to preserve some measure of separation . 
  that is , the only participating countries initially would be the smaller economies of eastern europe which share common security goals and concerns . 
  for the uk , i 'd prefer to continue going the route of [ cooperation with france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combined_joint_expeditionary_force ) . 
  when it comes to interventions in the near abroad ( like north africa and the middle east ) , the two countries are likely to have common interests . 
  continuing exercises to improve coordination as was done this year in the griffin strike exercise ( video [ 1 ] ( http://www.janes.com/article/59833/exercise-griffin-strike-2016-demonstrating-the-anglo-french-combined-joint-expeditionary-force ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.army.mod.uk/news/28545.aspx ) ) should be pursued . 
   maybe not the the extent that all countries will pay 2 % of gdp , but then has that ever been the case in the history of nato ? 
  [ see page four of this document from 1990 ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_1990_12/20100827_1990-070.pdf ) for the 1980s , every nato member except luxembourg was over 2 % gdp of spending . 
  ah , that is gratifying to hear , especially greece , those are places that really can do with the employment . 
  though i hope the islands are ok as well . 
  i have quite a few happy childhood memories from places like lesbos . 
  what i 'd like to know , is where the tourists are going instead . 
  we have tourism falls due to terrorism in places like ; turkey , egypt , and tunisia , while supposedly tourists are staying away from much of the greek aegean islands due to the migrant crisis . 
  where are they going instead ? 
  that goes for both the north-west eu and russian tourists . 
  that 's its selling point . 
  much cheaper to buy and fly than other new late 4th gen multirole jets , while still being as good , or nearly as good in many ways , and able to use the same top of the range us and european munitions . 
  so far it has found a gap in the market , and with the rising costs of military aircraft from the worlds major powers , it might still find a good export market . 
  well , up until this point , most cooperation has been one large country working as the framework for several smaller ones , for example , [ the uk jef ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uk_joint_expeditionary_force ) , though i do n't know how useful that would be . 
  since the smaller countries tend to be lacking in expeditionary equipment . 
  what seems interesting is the [ combined joint expeditionary force ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combined_joint_expeditionary_force ) between the uk and france . 
  individually they have the most capable expeditionary armed forces in nato after the usa , so combined there is a lot of potential .
