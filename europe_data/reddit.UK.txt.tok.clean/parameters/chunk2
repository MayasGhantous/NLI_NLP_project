  right , but isil are going to respond to air power by hiding among the civilian population . 
  which means that this ruthless behaviour by shia or kurdish forces on the sunnis are going to inevitably affect innocents . 
  [ if brutal sectarian violence escalates , even if isil is defeated , that will not end the killing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sectarian_violence_in_iraq#following_the_2003_invasion_of_iraq ), 
  of course , [ he got his 5 minutes as well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1m3uszqela ) . 
  if he did n't vote against it he would have a lot of explaining to do to the people who voted for him based on his anti-war credentials . 
  while i disagree with him on this issue , he 's probably much better informed on iraq 's history than most of the mps there . 
  that 's why i was redirecting it to france :d [ ohhhhh noooooo , your gdp growth has missed its targets so your deficit is growing , oh that 's terrible , you must feel awful , do n't mind me while i tweak my nipples , tell me more ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hao5ggajmsa ), 
  because one newspaper decided to make one sensational headline on one day , using silly extrapolation , does n't mean the whole uk thinks that . 
  most of us are too busy vigorously masturbating to any awful economic news coming out of france . 
  exactly , the last time the labour party in the uk tried to win an election with far left policies , was 1983 , and the manifesto was famously derided as [ `` the longest suicide note in history '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_longest_suicide_note_in_history ) . 
  they ended up out of power until 1997 , after they ditched most of the actually left wing policies . 
  so , where is ukraine going to get the money to pay poland for weapons ? 
  considering that ukraine is unable to pay its gas bill , i do n't think it 'll be paying cash up front . 
  is this on generous credit from poland ? 
  is another country giving ukraine aid or a low interest loan to buy weapons ? 
  this article is not very informative . 
  [ the creation of germany , which involved at various stages a war with ; denmark , austria , and france . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_of_germany#founding_a_unified_state ) kinda significant , since the creation of germany lead on to german nationalism , and the impact that had on european history . 
  the thing is , labour will want to get some sort of agreement well before the general election next year , or they will probably get wiped out in scotland . 
  as we all well know , of the 4 majority yes regions in the referendum , three were old labour voting areas . 
  them trying to stall change until after the election with some consitutional consultation bollocks is likely to end poorly for them . 
  there 'll probably be some sort of short-term fudge , like scottish mps abstaining on votes on devolved issues by an honour system , where they are technically allowed to vote on english issues , but do n't . 
  no idea what they will do about the budget , though . 
  right , but ukip is not really comparable to the snp . 
  the snp got ~ 45 % of the vote in the 2011 scottish parliament election on a 50 % turnout . 
  ukip got a 27.5 % vote in the 2014 european election on a 34.17 % turnout . 
  so , even on an election specifically about europe ( with no effect on who actually governs you ) , where only the people who actually give a toss about europe bother to show up , they still only got a little more than a quarter of the vote ( 27.5 % ) , and with all the anti-eu parties added together , still under a third . 
  the uk has also managed to retain more control over its affairs than most european countries , people are pretty happy with the euro and schengen opt-outs , and there seems to be no threat to what 's left of the rebate ( unless the uk were to exit and later re-negotiate entry ) . 
  now we can add on top of all the previous risks of a uk eu exit , the reopening the scottish independence question , and i think it unlikely, 
   one question : ca n't scottish government already do something for glasgow ? 
  [ they do have been active in social spending , especially to offset the cuts introduced by westminster . 
  ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/people/welfarereform/whatisthesgdoing ) scotland is able to do this because of the higher funding per head it receives compared to england . 
  the scottish independence campaigners believe that if scotland had full control of revenue ( as well as oil ) , they would be able to do better , both in terms of welfare , and targetted development funding to get areas of chronic high unemployment back to work . 
  also , if they were able to fundamentally develop their own welfare system , it would be better than having to use the system dictated in westminster , then modified . 
  why would n't they ? 
  the leadership of the ; conservative , labour , and lib dem parties are all for continued eu membership . 
  the reason the conservative 's want a referendum is because they are pretty sure the answer will be no , so it 's the easiest way to shut up the anti-eu wing of the party , and prevent voter defection to ukip . 
  whather it is fair or not is perfectly debatable , but when westminster agreed on the terms for the referendum , a simple majority was the agreed condition , and it would have been more unfair for westminster to change the terms after the agreement , when it realised it might lose . 
  [ a previous 1979 referendum on devolution had the yes result condition as a 50 % +1 majority , but the yes had to be at least 40 % of the electorate . 
  in the event , yes did beat no with 51.6 % , but because the turnout was `` only '' 64 % ( so 32.9 % of the electorate voted yes ) , devolution was not granted . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_devolution_referendum,_1979 ) this `` technicality '' defeat for devolution has made scottish nationalists wary of conditions other than a majority . 
  a lot of the eu migrants have n't though . 
  i remember the look of utter bemusement on the face of the eastern european cashier when a construction worker tried to pay for his sandwich with a northern irish note in southeast england . 
  i 'm sure in the north scottish notes are pretty common , but in the south outside london , non boe notes are pretty rare . 
  working class voters hope independent scotland will be a more socialist state than the uk where government policy is affected by the more right of centre votes in england . 
  glasgow is a former heavy industrial city ( eg shipbuilding ) , but most of the industry was lost , and the people blame the apathy of westminster to places far from london for this . 
  the yes campaign put a lot of effort campaigning there . 
  to win , the yes campaign had to overcome the status quo advantage by informing people of what they saw as the benefits of independence . 
  the presence of faslane nearby . 
  independent scotland would remove nukes from its territory . 
  this appeals to those in the glasgow area especially , as they are the likely collateral in an enemy first strike . 
  it is n't a proper exit poll , it is regular poll done on people who voted . 
  also the very reason no exit poll was done is because this is so different from a general election , that there is no past data to base extrapolations on . 
  so it is n't over until it 's over . 
  besides , the fact that a fair referendum on independence happened in a major eu country , and that the people had their fair say without violence is a fantastic precedent to set . 
  haha , i wonder if this one was planned at the nato summit ... `` ok , so no ukraine in nato , and no nato bases in poland , so we 'll make joint military unit between two nato countries and ukraine , then base it in eastern poland '' add in the commonwealth significance of lublin , and they might as well have made the units insignia a picture of putin 's face with a cock drawn going in his mouth . 
  excellent news for ireland . 
  this comes on [ top of ireland 's long-term borrowing costs falling rapidly this year , as international confidence in ireland returns ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/markets/ireland-s-long-term-borrowing-cost-falls-below-uk-s-for-first-time-in-six-years-1.1790267 ) . 
  hope the good news keeps coming !, 
  [ absolutely , russia is increasing its military spending rapidly , while the rest of europe cuts theirs . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/14/russia-spends-more-wealth-arms-us-2013 ) [ then since the 2008 war with georgia , russia has been reforming its military to be more professional , and more capable when operating outside russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_russian_military_reform ) a lot of this is simply making up for the neglect to russia 's armed forces during the 90s , it is wrong to compare it to germany 's rearmament in the 1930s . 
  what it does mean is that the capabilities of russias military now in 2014 , and in future , will be a far more capable force than it was in 2008 . 
  the reason the uk spends billions on maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent , is because no british government has total faith that the usa would take part in a nuclear war on behalf of the uk . 
  if they would n't do it for the uk , it is even less likely they would do it for estonia . 
  the very fact that russia is so much weaker than the ussr was , only makes it even less likely they would . 
  there is no risk of moscow conquering europe and then threatening the whole world with soviet-communist domination , so why endanger the lives of every us citizen by escalating a regional conventional war to a global nuclear one ? 
  i would n't be angry at a us president who did n't intervene with nuclear weapons , because he would be doing , as a democratically elected leader , what is best for his people . 
  no , i am fully aware that the majority of ukrainians who speak the russian language at home consider themselves a ukrainian . 
  i was pointing out that when one of the first moves of the new ukrainian parliament was to attempt to repeal a 2012 law guaranteeing specific rights to the regional languages of ukraine , that was interpreted by media based in russia as a targeted attack on the rights of russian speakers in ukraine . 
  this , fitting into the narrative of a fascist revolution , played a big role in the initial unrest in eastern ukraine . 
  it does n't matter what the ukrainian government does , what matters is how the russian language news broadcast from over the border portrays it . 
  it will be very easy for those looking for evidence of discrimination to find it . 
  cleaning politics is a necessary step , but there are pitfalls along the way , both natural , and being dug by others . 
  [ relevant `` yes prime minister '' clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmovewtdycs ), 
  while in theory a good idea , if in practice it ends up being perceived by russian speaking ukrainians as a witch-hunt , or purge ( correctly or not ) , it may escalate tensions . 
   zimbabwe now that would be entertaining . 
  in thirty years time , first-minister-for-life alex salmond , going full mugabe . 
  though i do wonder , if scotland did get independence , would the snp stay in government for decades on the euphoria of delivering on their promise , or would it quickly splinter once the `` independence '' issue that has united the party is gone . 
  [ also , funny because at the moment tony abbott ( born in england ) , is currently being accused of still being a british citizen , in what i hope is a tongue in cheek campaign ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/09/show-us-your-citizenship-why-the-tony-abbott-birthers-want-to-believe ), 
  i wonder how you would divide england . 
  the population of scotland is only ~ 5.3 million , which is less than greater london , ~ 8.2 million . 
  [ here is a list of the various regions of the uk as they are currently divided for administrative purposes . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_of_the_countries_of_the_united_kingdom ) . 
  what does everyone think , should that be the basis of england regional government ? 
  should the borders be drawn differently ? 
  or should some of the smaller regions be merged ( eg , yorkshire & humber + north east ) ? 
  how much power is appropriate ? 
  personally i would like regions to get as much as possible . 
  devolved governments need proper legislative and revenue raising powers to make citizens care about local politics . 
  i believe that ni both gets far more funding per capita under [ the barnett formula than the uk average ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barnett_formula#proportional_to_population ) , even more than scotland . 
  while unlike scotland , it does n't generate more revenue per capita than the uk average . 
  if ni went independent now , it would need drastic action on public spending and taxes to balance its budget , and the roi is not currently in a position to absorb a poorer region the size of ni . 
  that said , now there is peace , ni is catching up with its neighbours . 
  maybe in a decade or two it will be in a position where leaving the union is a viable option . 
  [ edit : just found this article discussing corporation tax incentives in ni from 2012 , and it has this part ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/top-expert-warns-northern-ireland-economy-is-facing-meltdown-28779242.html )  * `` the running cost of northern ireland is # 20bn a year of which we contribute about # 9bn in taxes . 
  the british taxpayer is not going to continue giving us # 11bn a year indefinitely . '' * while i do n't know if that statement is true ( or was true in 2012 ) , if the uk as a whole is running a very big deficit at the moment , then ni is running an even bigger one proportionally . 
  sure , it might go back to a two party system . 
  the lib dems are probably going to get annihilated because of joining the coalition , and it is possible that besides defectors like carswell , when it comes down to the general election , most conserative voters will not risk swapping sides to ukip . 
  the fall in proportion of voters supporting the two major parties is not a single election or decade `` blip '' but a postwar trend , there are a lot of undeniable issues : * regional parties are becoming more popular in ; scotland , ni , and wales with the biggest change in scotland . 
  this is partly dissatisfaction in westminster , and partly devolution legitimising them as alternatives to `` westminster parties '' . 
  * proportional eu elections have given small parties legitimacy , money , and so a voice .
