  in both 2009 and 2014 labour and the conservativies got less than 50 % between them in the eu elections , and small party meps have commanded a lot of publicity ( though of course not always into westminster success ) . 
  * access to the public has changed , it is easy to sneer at social media , but the ability for like-minded people dissatisfied with their government to band together and organise is a huge change from information being on control of the print and tv media . 
  * the general trend of election participation is down . 
  this provides an opportunity for the disengaged to be targetted by alternative parties . 
  someone who would otherwise not have voted does n't care that it 's only a two horse race in their constituency when they want to protest the current situation . 
  as i understand , the `` corrective '' power of fptp is based on a high turnout , and strong disagreement between the two parties making people vote for the party closest to their views for fear of the party they disagree with more getting into power . 
  currently there is not a lot to choose with , between labour and the conservatives , and that appears to be driving the appeal of `` other '' . 
  the thing is , while both parties lurched heavily to the left and right in the 80s , since the 90s the general `` consensus '' in politics , is that whichever party abandons the centre ground is going to get annihilated . 
  that said , a lot of these small parties disintegrate once they get any power or attention ; bnp got meps then appears to have faded under the spotlight , george galloways `` respect '' does n't seem to have anything to offer to british muslims since the iraq war , [ the greens have n't had an entirely smooth ride in brighton ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/15/greens-blown-it-in-brighton ) , and of course the lib dems seem to have blown their support by making compromises in the coalition . 
  i 'm not saying fptp is dead , but it certainly does n't make as much sense as it once did . 
  last election , 67.6 % of the votes went to labour & conservatives , the lowest since ww2 , and part of a downward trend . 
  in the 1950s it was 90 % + this suggests that hung parliament results will be more common , and even if a party does get a majority of seats , it may be achieved with less than 40 % of the vote , undermining their legitimacy . 
  yes , i was saying that affordable cars are a growing part of the eu car market . 
  i do n't know whether ten years will be enough for ukraine to catch up , as while its labour costs are low , other costs like ; modernising plants , logistics for component supply & product export and navigating bureaucracy will need work . 
  [ i hope it will be possible for them to balance between the two . 
  the european commission claims in the . pdf i linked ( the second claim it addresses ) ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/january/tradoc_152074.pdf ) , that joining the efta will not prevent ukraine signing free trade deals with other countries , but that the terms of membership of the eurasian economic union ( currently ; russia , belarus , and kazakhstan ) are why they can not join both at the same time . 
  i do n't know whether that is entirely true or not . 
  [ right after romania joined the eu in 2007 , the 2008 financial crisis hit , then in 2009 they got a $ 20 billion loan ( mostly from the imf and eu ) in return for increasing taxes and reducing spending . 
  the debt appears to have stabilised for now , but it is certainly very big . 
  however , the financial problems would have occurred whether or not romania was in the eu . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_romania#eu_membership_.282007.29 ) yeah , the big story with car manufacturing in europe in recent years has been overcapacity , leading to most carmakers being unprofitable . 
  however , that is mostly an issue in the mid-range of the car market , the value end of the market has grown . 
   [ the overcapacity comes at a time when the european market mix is shifting precipitously . 
  in 1990 , volume manufacturers controlled 85 percent of the car market . 
  premium manufacturers like bmw and daimler held 13 percent , and value manufacturers selling ** entry level cars had just 2 percent of the market ** . 
  now , premium manufacturers have 16 percent , ** value manufacturers have 20 percent ** , and there 's just 63 percent left for the middle of the market . 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/michelinemaynard/2012/06/28/why-the-european-car-market-is-headed-for-a-meltdown/ ) there are certainly big risks for ukrainian industry in joining the european free trade area , however , recent events have indicated that relying on russia for trade has its own risks . 
  ukraine wo n't be able to compete on the luxury end of the market , but the reason i gave the dacia example is because it shows that in the enlarged european free trade area , there is a good market for affordable cars , because so long as the logistics is sorted out , and the factory has enough investment , the east can compete on price . 
  the issue is that ukraine will need to partner with an external car-maker for the investment to bring ukraine 's factories and designs up to international standards . 
  if it goes well , ukraine could gain a good export market , if it goes badly , ukraine could lose its internal market . 
  it depends how well the transition is managed , ten years should be enough . 
  not immediately , the government will want to protect the ukrainian car industry until it is ready to be part of the eu . 
  the most famous example of a eastern country that managed to preserve its car industry in the eu trade area is [ romania 's dacia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automobile_dacia ) . 
  however , dacia was bought by renault in 1999 well before joining the eu . 
  this was both good , as it brought eu investment and expertise , however , that could be bad in the future if profitability falls and renault , a foreign company , tries to cut costs . 
  it is likely that ukraine will try and protect its car industry from eu competition for as long as possible . 
  [ some countries in free trade areas will try anything to protect their local industry from competition , even when there are supposed to be no tariffs ] ( http://carnegieendowment.org/ieb/2012/03/22/modern-industrial-policy-lessons-from-malaysia-s-auto-industry/a4ct ), 
  [ the www.gov.uk website has a reasonable summary of devolution so far ] ( https://www.gov.uk/devolution-of-powers-to-scotland-wales-and-northern-ireland ) . 
  each of the three devolved governments are different . 
  there is also london , but the gla and mayor of london are not usually counted when talking about devolution . 
  at the moment westminster plays the role of a uk legislature , and english legislature . 
  you ca n't really address the west lothian question without increasing the difference between scottish mps ( with one role ) and english mps ( with two roles ) . 
  in the event of a no vote , and the extra devolution for scotland , it 's only going to get even more pronounced . 
  that , combined with the ongoing erosion of the two party system , has got to make eventual fundamental change to english politics inevitable . 
  who knows , maybe the extra concession wrung out of westminster by the scots with their devolved parliament , will inspire calls for regional devolution in england . 
  [ here is the european commission 's response to specific concerns about the eu-ukraine agreement ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/january/tradoc_152074.pdf ) . 
  whether or not you agree with the european commission 's assessment , it is nice to see an attempt to address the rumours about the agreement head-on . 
  i hope that the eu gives all the assistance it can to helping ukraine with the development of its economy , and attracting international investment . 
  a successful ukraine , with beneficial trade , both west as well as east , is the best way to secure ukraine 's future . 
  i just hope that the eventual exposure to competition helps clean up corruption , rather than drive businesses under . 
  still , according to the commission , many of the tariffs protecting sensitive parts of ukrainian industry ( for example motor vehicles ) have as long as 10 years before being phased out , while the eu tariffs against ukrainian exports will be reduced much quicker . 
  this is not an overnight change, 
  maybe the glasgow buckfast party . 
  it was a very harsh action , but just because the war was over , does n't mean everything was great , in the aftermath of the armistice , the uk had to deal with ; irish unrest ( leading to civil war and independence ) , trade union & communist agitation ( the russian revolution inspired the working class , and panicked the upper class ) , unprecedented national debt and the global `` spanish '' flu pandemic . 
  it was n't just the belgians , who were forced out of their jobs , hundreds of thousands of women who had been encouraged into doing `` mens '' work , were forced to give up their jobs . 
  there was a lot of fear of civil unrest after the war , war-time patriotism had suppressed a lot of disputes , but if that tolerance ends at the same time as a lot of young men fresh from a terrible war come back to find their jobs `` taken '' behind their back , they might not take it well . 
  [ come on , at least post the clip :d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsd1d-6p6qi ) i like the delivery on the last line . 
  note for those of you in the uk , you wo n't be able to watch it on youtube without using a proxy until it is broadcast in the uk ( tuesday 2345 sky atlantic ) . 
  if anyone is wondering why a news website from the other side of the planet has decided to post an article talking about anti-immigrant sentiment specifically in sweden ( though yes , sweden 's election is right now ) , without mentioning it is a europe-wide issue . 
  it is probably because of a child abuse case in sweden , where malaysian parents were arrested and prosecuted . 
  the ops source , the malay mail online , is actually one of the better malaysian news websites , [ here you can see an article from the malay mail online , which tries to inform its readers that in this case , there is reasonable evidence of child abuse to justify a trial ] ( http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/three-things-about-the-alleged-malaysian-child-abuse-case-in-sweden ) . 
  smacking and caning for disciplining children is normal in malaysia , and there was a wide assumption in that country by those who heard about this case , that it was a simply a `` clash of culture '' . 
  in much of the malaysian media , the reporting of how the case was handled , like the [ fostering of the children ] ( http://english.astroawani.com/news/show/more-than-300-000-children-forcefully-separated-in-sweden-28648 ) caused outrage in some in malaysia , and suspicions that racism played a part in how the family was treated . 
  therefore , an article about rising anti-immigrant sentiment in sweden is likely to be of interest to malaysian readers ( clickbait title ) . 
  [ yes it does deprive them of their liberty , which is why there are time limits on how long you can be held without being charged with a crime ] ( https://www.gov.uk/arrested-your-rights/how-long-you-can-be-held-in-custody ) . 
  the point is that if there are large groups of people attempting to commit immigration offenses , there is reasonable grounds for detention , and subsequently , charges . 
  the problem is what the hell do you do with them afterwards . 
  the thing is , i can kind of understand the protestant vs catholic thing as being a proxy for republican vs unionist views , but this kind of anger at the evils of popery is straight from the 17th century . 
  while religious affiliation is still far more important in ni than elsewhere in the uk or in the roi , at least the religious aspect to hate is n't as fiery as it was . 
  then again , i also find it amusing that as recently as the 1960s usa , [ jfk 's catholicism was controversial ] ( http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=16920600 ) . 
  while more recently in the uk , when we all found out that [ tony blair had been secretly catholic for most of his political career ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/22/uk.religion1 ) , everyone said `` yeah you 're catholic , so what ? 
  now what about those wmds in iraq ... '', 
  [ oh yeah , the sarkozy thing ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/07/eu.france ) . 
  the uks position is to try and avoid anything undermining nato since the usa makes up 2/3 of nato spending , and setting up a competing organisation risks the ability to `` sponge '' security off the us through article 5 . 
  i do n't think the uk is concerned about the theoretical loss of sovereignty of its armed forces , since nato pretty much does that already . 
  [ in fact , it was france that spent 43 years outside nato 's command structure , because it did n't want another country 's officers commanding the french armed forces ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/france-s-return-to-nato-sarkozy-breaks-with-de-gaulle-and-tradition-a-612840.html ), 
  eh , i 'm not sure what you mean by `` eu army '' there are the eu battlegroups , which have been implemented , [ and which the uk does participate in , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_battlegroup ) but have [ never been used ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20131220-eu-mali-european-union-france-central-african-republic-francois-hollande/ ) . 
  or are you referring to something else ? 
  the uk is made out as an anti-eu saboteur , but going by the lisbon treaty referendum results ; in france , the netherlands , and ireland ( round 1 ) , i think that those opposing a more federal eu need more representation , not less . 
  it would be interesting if the mep candidates for the various national parties actually campaigned under their eu party name ( eg epp ) , and with their eu party manifesto , rather than the confusion that results from people voting for their national parties as proxys . 
  upvote for relevance . 
  interesting he goes on to say corporation tax is levied by where the economic activity is , not where the head office is . 
  i wish that were true , that way problems like google ireland ( plus google bermuda ) , and amazon s.a.r.l. 
  would be non-issues . 
  mr salmond is oversimplifying taxation of corporations a little . 
  well , in the 2014 european elections , while the uk voted ukip in first place , still ~ 70 % of those who voted , voted for a party that had staying in the eu as a key part of their european policy . 
  i can see a clear case for a referendum , i just hope that it is n't managed in a way that causes uncertainty that harms international investment in the uk . 
  [ carbon capture and storage ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbon_capture_and_storage ) ( though it is n't a mature technology , and i would rather the investment went elsewhere ) . 
  though , he probably meant short term local environmental harm ; soot , nitrogen , and sulphur compounds . 
  like issues with smog , and acid rain , which the latest coal power is much better at than in the past . 
  co2 does n't harm the local environment , the problems with co2 are global and long term ( global warming and ocean acidification ) . 
  [ so , they cite article 10 of the european convention on human rights ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_10_of_the_european_convention_on_human_rights )  article 10 -- freedom of expression  1 . 
  everyone has the right to freedom of expression . 
  this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers . 
  this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting , television or cinema enterprises . 
  the exercise of these freedoms , since it carries with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society , in the interests of national security , territorial integrity or public safety , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , for the protection of the reputation or rights of others , for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence , or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary . 
  the whole second paragraph lists exceptions to the free distribution on information , including national security . 
  i doubt many of the major eu countries are currently publishing full disclosure of their interactions with foreign intelligence agencies , or will do so in the event of the echr ruling that they should . 
  also , north africa is not entirely stable , most visibly right now in the messy aftermath of the libyan civil war , but probably most significantly due to cross-border islamists ( as has been seen recently in [ mali ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_mali_conflict ) , and [ algeria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/in_amenas_hostage_crisis ) ) going from being at the mercy of russian geopolitics , to being at the mercy of global jihadists is not necessarily an improvement . 
  lng tanker capacity is one other possibility ( as we have gone for in the uk ) , but it is more expensive than piped russian gas .
