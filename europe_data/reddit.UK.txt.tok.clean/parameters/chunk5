  in the usa , sitting presidents tend to win re-election ( incumbency really seems to help ) , and then step down due to the convention of the two term limit . 
  we do n't have that here , so a prime minister usually ends his career by either losing an election ( major , brown ) , or being forced out by internal party or external pressure ( thatcher , blair ) . 
  so they always seem to end on a low often in an unexpected fashion , while a us president ( who more or less knows exactly when he will be losing office on the day he was first elected ) has a whole second term to secure his legacy . 
  basically , the us president entirely owes his position to being directly voted for by the us public ( rather than being the leader of the party with the most seats ) , so it is much harder to depose him between presidential elections . 
  then the two term limit lets them step down on a relative high while maintaining face ( reagan , and clinton ) . 
  another big issue is that the usa has been the worlds most successful large country through the 20th century , while the uk has been in more or less continuous decline ( relative to the rest of the world ) since ww2 . 
  victorian prime ministers like gladstone , disraeli and palmerston are still respected today , probably in large part because of the greatness of britain during this time , lending them a `` golden age '' label which lets their faults be overlooked . 
  i would predict that us leaders who get the same respect as the 20th century greats are going to get fewer and further between if the usa were to experience such a period of relative decline . 
  certainly , i ca n't imagine a present day us president with a record as mixed as jfk being quite as lauded now . 
  conservative ministers may not be disowning thatcher , but they certainly are n't mentioning her as much as you would expect for a thrice elected , first female prime minister of the uk from a relatively modest background . 
  the reason being that `` thatcherism '' is a wee bit toxic to those outside of the economic right wing of the country . 
  still better than finding yourself at a multi-level-marketing sales pitch . 
  just saying ... 
  that was omar al-bashir , president of sudan , wanted for alleged war crimes over the conflict in darfur . 
  the [ icc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_criminal_court ) issued the warrant , however the court has become [ controversial among african union members ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_criminal_court#au_withdrawal_proposal ) because despite its claims to global scope it is perceived as targeting active african politicians almost exclusively, 
  which is absolutely why i think the eu should [ follow through on the trade deal ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-15-5035_en.htm ) which the maidan protesters supported . 
  giving ukraine 's economy a leg up , reducing their dependence on russia and helping them tackle corruption to improve the lives of ukraine 's people , is a worthy cause . 
  however , ( again ignoring heightened risk of war ) fast-tracking nato membership will not protect ukraine in the short term , because even an accelerated process will not be instantaneous , especially due to disagreements within nato . 
  bear in mind that it was during a deepening of ties between georgia and nato , speculated to include its accession , that russia decided to escalate the conflict in its separatist regions . 
  i agree , the right course of action for the uk is to continue being the biggest eu donor to syrian refugee camps , and to take the most vulnerable directly from the camps , rather than incentivizing all and sundry to make a dangerous journey at the mercy of predatory organised criminal groups . 
  in addition , i also feel somewhat bemused by certain governments making a public show of generosity in welcoming refugees/migrants , and then when that implicit invitation is accepted by so many , deciding that actually this is a crisis that is the responsibility of all europe . 
  including the countries that realised that making a journey to europe attractive was going to lead to bigger problems down the road , and that those seeking refugee status are coming from all over asia and africa , rather than this being a single conflict issue . 
  that might be true , but a lot of those who do n't support joining really do n't want to join . 
  even if we ignore the risks of war involved in a country that has an active territorial dispute with russia joining nato , i would argue that the damage joining nato does to the hopes of reconciliation in eastern ukraine is too much . 
  the eu trade deal , however , should go ahead . 
  improving the lives of those in ukraine , as well as standards of governance is important . 
  while i would like to say it 'll be an instant buy on release . 
  i think by now 99 % of tw players are cynical about the state of the games on release , and their dlc release structure/pricing . 
  though i suppose `` wait for a goty style bundle on steam sale '' kind of attitude is for the best when it comes to pretty much any game , except certain multiplayer titles .

  [ they work with the un and trusted ( often british ) ngo 's . 
  ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-to-see-first-hand-how-uk-aid-is-helping-most-vulnerable-syrian-refugees ) [ they audit it fairly well , and have achieved a fair amount so far ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/460679/dfid_syria_crisis_response_summary_14.09.15.pdf ) while i 'm sure there is some waste in the aid given , supporting the refugees in the region with some waste , is still cheaper than paying to feed/clothe/house / educate/medicate/integrate them in western europe . 
  for what it 's worth , at least one declassified warsaw pact battle plan from 1979 which uses multiple nuclear weapons against european nato countries in a `` limited '' nuclear exchange scenario , [ happens to spare the uk and france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seven_days_to_the_river_rhine#nuclear_response ) . 
  one strong possibility is that in a war involving nato against an opponent that uses nuclear weapons , that opponent may avoid using nuclear weapons against those nato states that can respond in kind . 
  well , to be fair it does add context to the story to those who are n't hot on the comparative gdp / capita of eastern europe . 
  if you did n't know the wealth of romania relative to the rest of the eu , you might interpret the romanian government 's wish to take less than a third of the refugees they are being asked to as being more selfish and unreasonable than it is . 
   without the support of the west , the opposition would 've been long gone !, 
  western aid has often been non-lethal and has had trouble finding `` acceptable '' groups to back ( us aid even stopped after islamists siezed a stockpile of it ) , while saudi arabia and qatar have hosed money and weapons at rebel groups with minimal vetting for ideology . 
  you might argue that the us has not dissuaded the saudis and qataris from doing so , but it is a gross oversimplification to call it `` western support '' . 
  the trouble with finding acceptable forces to fight the regime is a huge problem for western miiltary aid , for example , the problems with [ `` division 30 '' formed to fight isis  ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/08/trained-syrian-fighters-refusing-fight-150807114420346.html )  the us last month admitted it trained no more than 60 syrian opposition fighters to battle isil , far below expectations , defence secretary ash carter told congress . 
   the programme , which launched in may in jordan and turkey , was designed to train as many as 5,400 fighters a year . 
  washington admitted it could not train more than 60 fighters , citing rigorous vetting of recruits . 
  well , firstly , the whole reason the syrian civil war is going on so long is because foreign intervention is already happening largely without the west . 
  without the ; money , equipment and personnel supplied by iran & russia assad would long ago have lost , but without vast quantities of money , equipment and foreign fighters so would the rebel groups . 
  while ultimately there needs to be a political settlement , achieving that through purely diplomatic means without force to back it up is implausible at the moment . 
  whether or not you think the yugoslavian conflicts of the 90 's would have been better if they had been left to fight it out themselves is another matter , but it seems that the negotiated peace of the [ dayton agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dayton_agreement ) would not have been brought about without [ nato intervention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_deliberate_force ) , and while it is certainly possible to argue otherwise , it is likely that that outcome was preferable to letting the fighting continue . 
  that last sentence of his post pretty much confirms he 's trolling . 
  [ well in terms of sheer money the us is by far the biggest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_governments_by_development_aid ) , though in terms of as a proportion of the usa 's gni , yes , it is n't near the top, 
  `` mostly from the eu '' is true , but barely , 45 % were from outside the eu . 
  it 's possible that if assad is able to obtain heavy weaponry on favourable terms from russia , it would be quicker to hire ex-servicemen as mercenaries ( with years of experience on similar equipment ) from cis countries to operate it and/or maintain it . 
  the attrition on experienced tank crew , pilots and mechanics is problematic for the saa . 
  though this is all speculation, 
  surely it is more expensive to ; feed , clothe , and house refugees in a high cost of living country than a low one ? 
  that 's why helping refugees through aid makes sense to me . 
  [ oh , and the uk is currently giving very generously in aid , second largest in absolute terms , and fifth largest in % gni terms ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_governments_by_development_aid ),

  even including the soviet union , those 6 countries have 399 swimming medals compared to the usa 's 520 . 
  there 's also a lot of medals in swimming , but not one single european country has a lot of medals in it because non-european countries have been so dominant at it .

  nobody is arguing that air-strikes alone will defeat isis . 
  they have , however been instrumental in reversing their advance in northern syria and iraq , when paired with motivated ground forces ( most notably the forces of the ypd and krg ) . 
  yes , ultimately isis must be defeated by destroying its appeal to angry , scared , or naive muslims , but until that can be achieved , they must be checked militarily . 
  small teams of special forces on the ground directing air-strikes is the least worst option for this .

  they are refugees , but they are also migrants . 
  they are passing through more than half a dozen countries with no conflict to reach a wealthy country of their choice , and after spending their life 's savings to get to germany or wherever , it 's unlikely they 'll head right back to where they came from ( eg syria ) if the country became peaceful next year . 
  while there are supposed to be some `` elite '' units present in ukraine , most of them are apparently ordinary volunteer contract soldiers . 
  besides , artillery does n't care how elite you are , training can only help so much when a shell / rocket lands on top of your position . 
  [ nearly half of the uk state aid targeted at syrian refugees is actually allocated inside syria ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/455330/dfid_syria_crisis_response_summary__2015.08.20_.pdf ) .

  that seems like an odd thing to buy for the war in donbass , with no enemy cas . 
  right , but in the case of an air crash , you do n't tend to dole out the blame until the aaib has finished its investigation . 
  the crash could have happened due to a mechanical or instrumental fault , so the blame would lie with those responsible for ensuring the plane was airworthy enough for an airshow . 
  there might have been an unforeseeable medical event which caused him to lose control , if the pilot had been certified as healthy enough to carry out extreme flight manoeuvres to a proper standard , that is not his fault . 
  even if it does turn out to be pilot error , unless the error was particularly egregious , it is possible that it is in fact the airshow planners who are held at fault for allowing dangerous manoeuvres ( which will always have an element of risk about them ) to be carried out over a busy road . 
  oh , and on top of that , [ the lorry driver who killed six people in glasgow due to a ( possibly foreseeable ) medical event ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-34016267 ) may very well escape prison , so yes , this can even be true for road users as well .

  what shouild they have done ? 
  imagine if it was nearly any other person , and the uk allowed a `` rape suspect '' fleeing the authorities of another eu country to escape , because the uk could n't be bothered to spend the money to arrest him . 
  the uk would justly be condemned internationally for putting money above justice . 
  the only people who are in a position to compromise are the swedish prosecutors ( though i 'm not aware of the exact reasons he ca n't take part in questioning/trial from the embassy , for example ) . 
  [ yep , and the us is still buying their rd-180 rocket engines for both their civil and military military launches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rd-180 ), 
   the eu is not at threat from russia in any way . 
  a look at military spending shows that the eu is only ` underspending ' compared to the us , compared to everyone else on the planet the eu spends more than enough . 
  for various reasons the actual number of personnel and weapons systems in eu armed forces , despite all that money , are quite low . 
  mostly due to higher costs and less economies of scale . 
  add in the ongoing overall decline in spending in the eu ( compared to increase in spending by russia ) , and simply comparing the militaries by present day spending is misleading . 
   it also has a large nuclear deterrent which includes submarines able to strike back in the event of a pre-emptive strike on the eu . 
  if russia ever attacked an eu nation it would be wiped out . 
  the very reason the uk maintained an independent nuclear deterrent , is because even one of the closest allies of the usa does not trust a us president to start a nuclear war on their behalf . 
  i do n't think anyone honestly believes a uk prime minister or french president would start a nuclear war over the occupation of latvian territory , for example . 
   it is true that the russian military is modernizing and more capable than it was , but this capability is almost entirely defensive . 
  they lack any real force projection ability and instead of spending money on updating the air force they spend it on anti-aircraft capability ( which is probably the best in the world ) . 
  we are n't talking about force projection to distant shores ( like the mistral purchase ) , we are talking about former ussr/warsaw pact countries on the russian border nervous about their russian passport holding population turned into cassus belli . 
  in which case yes , sams as a protective umbrella for a ground offensive ( like the sinai in 1973 ) are perfectly capable of being used to make an air campaign to remove entrenched occupying forces impossible ( like 1991 gulf war ) .
