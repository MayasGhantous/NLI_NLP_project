  also , afaik , russia is still developing the mig-35 and su pak fa , while there is n't any manned warplane development in the eu . 
   it 's important to remember that from the russian perspective it is facing an aggressively expanding nato [ so aggressively expanding they rejected the application of ukraine in 2008 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/02/ukraine-georgia ) . 
  if there is high levels of support in a country to join nato , i 'm not sure of the reasoning to allow russia to have a veto . 
   which is seeking to destroy russia . 
  i 'm sure there are some politicians in the usa ( and maybe poland ) who would like to `` destroy '' russia , but i do n't think anyone sane honestly believes that is nato policy . 
   at this point nato does more harm than good . 
  all eu nations should leave it and concentrate on integrating their own forces into a coherent force . 
  right , because all those neutral eu countries ( eg austria ) would love it if the eu became an explicit military alliance , and those eu countries less keen on continued integration ( eg uk ) would love to subsume their armed forces into an eu one . 
  i agree that there is no immediate threat from russia . 
  however defence is a long term issue . 
  link for those who have n't seen [ the onion 's cartoons ] ( http://www.theonion.com/graphic/sun-burned-50985 ) i really like [ the `` foreigners '' in this one :d ] ( http://www.theonion.com/graphic/sucker-fans-50829 ), 
  malaysia has a few domestic car manufacturers , most significantly [ proton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proton_ ( automobile ) ) and [ perodua ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perodua ) . 
  they both more or less started out making iterations of licenced japanese designs , but have put more investment into car development in recent years . 
  while technically asean is a `` free trade area '' , many of the countries there have a long history of being protectionist toward their domestic car industry , both with tariffs on imports and state aid/tax incentives . 
  the result is that cars are comparatively expensive in malaysia ( though fuel has been subsidised ) . 
  that is n't necessarily a bad thing from the point of view of the writer , since to clarify the headline , the reader must read the article . 
  the purpose of a headline is not to inform ( though it should not deceive ) , it is to get someone to read the article . 
  it is usually clarified in the first paragraph , anyway . 
  you 're right that no matter how litvinenko died , the russian state would be a top suspect in his death , but that was n't my point . 
  my point was to address the idea that it was stupid to use po ^ 210 , due to how exotic it was , making its source too obvious . 
  when in fact , a killer may actually reasonably expect that nobody would ever find out the exact poison , due to the difficulty in detecting it unless you know exactly what you are looking for . 
  it 's headline english . 
  when writing headlines for newspapers all grammatical `` rules '' go out the window . 
  all that matters is getting the most people to read the article with the fewest words possible . 
  you would n't use it in conversation , or even inside the actual written newspaper article column . 
  afaik , they had no idea what was killing him for some time , po ^ 210 emits nearly 100 % alpha and 0 % gamma radiation , and is lethal at minuscule doses . 
  this makes it pretty much impossible to detect with normal hospital testing , it could have even been missed when they sent blood & urine samples for specialised radiological analysis at a nuclear weapons research site . 
  article : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33678717  ... the results looked negative . 
  however , they noticed a small spike in the read-out , barely above background levels , at an energy of 803 kilo electron volts ( kev ) . 
   by pure chance another aldermaston scientist , who 'd worked on britain 's early atomic bomb programme decades ago , happened to overhear his colleagues discussing this small spike in the trace . 
  he recognised it immediately as the small gamma ray signal from polonium-210 . 
  he knew this because polonium-210 was a vital component of early nuclear bombs . 
  it is entirely possible that the killers thought the poison was too unusual to be detected . 
  pretty much , it would be insane for them not to have a plan b with the brinkmanship they were trying to pull in negotiations . 
  cyprus used to belong to the ottoman empire , who were being hammered by the russians throughout the latter half of the 19th century . 
  so the ottomans leased cyprus to the british empire for their support against the russians . 
  ww1 happened leading to war between britain and the turks . 
  britain took it on an `` official '' basis in the breakup of the ottoman empire , since it was an important naval base on the suez routes to india , au/nz , malaya etc. 
  single man with distinctive head-gear flees from germans who feel they 're owed a lot of money , though his swiss friends who cover for him are n't so lucky .

  even if that works , destabilising russia does n't necessarily remove the danger . 
  like that time in 1917 when germany thought it would be an awesome idea to send a bunch of dissidents into russia [ ( including lenin ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_lenin#the_february_revolution_and_the_july_days:_1917 ) . 
  sure , it helped bring down the russian empire , but it did n't exactly increase european security . 
  as i recall , it was quite widely discussed with relation to [ black wednesday ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_wednesday#aftermath ) . 
  i would n't say it was all foresight , but the experiences with the erm certainly made scepticism of the euro far more widespread in the uk than it might otherwise have been . 
  you can see the aftermath of the erm debacle in the first two of [ gordon brown 's `` five economic tests '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_economic_tests ) that were used to rule out euro-zone membership for the uk . 
  the circumstances of his departure wo n't be clear for a while . 
  the degree to which he jumped , and the degree to which he was pushed ( and by whom ) . 
  since he announces it right after the referendum goes the way he wants , how long ago was he planning to announce this ? 
  [ a lot of spain is quite high up ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:europe_topography_map_en.png ), 
  exactly , that 's why we should submit a modest proposal to the ecb to help the greeks in their troubled situation , by importing greek babies for the purposes of sacrifice in lieu of debt payments . 
  it 's a mutually beneficial arrangement , honestly . 
  a lot of small businesses do n't accept cards for whatever reason . 
  yes , sometimes tax evasion can be part of that reason , but for a lot of business owners the overheads of card payments are not worth it if most people are willing to pay by cash . 
  personally , i like to pay by cash in a lot of places where you might have to hand over your card , out of concern for card fraud . 
  well , 36.9 % voted for the conservatives , i 'm not sure to what extent ukip wanted austerity , and i am sure that most people voting for them were n't doing it just for their spending plans , but even adding them in only gets to 49.5 % . 
  i think every other party was not for austerity , so saying `` the people voted for it '' is n't quite right . 
  while london had a disruptive ( though non-violent ) [ anti-uber protest last year ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-27799938 ) . 
  this year it seems that they are focusing on [ uber 's tax structure ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33093678 ) . 
  [ it seems uber is using their being based in the netherlands to pay a cheaper dutch rate of tax ] ( http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/cabbies-fight-uber-tax-loophole-9975149.html ) , despite the journeys beginning and ending in london with a london based driver . 
  if this is true , i can see why they 're upset . 
  uber certainly has a right to do what it does , but it should have a level tax playing field to do so . 
  refugees are a subset of immigrants , the terms are not mutually exclusive . 
  not only that , a legitimate refugee might choose their place of refuge based on the criteria of an economic migrant . 
  for example a somalian or afghan fleeing the situations in their country may be a refugee , but when they choose to travel through half a dozen safe countries to reach europe , then ( once in europe ) , travel through even more countries to reach the final ( usually wealthy ) country of their choosing , they are most definitely an economic migrant as well as a refugee . 
  private eye is quite similarly provocative/childish with their captioned photo front pages , though ( not that i think that 's necessarily a bad thing ) . 
  that said , i ca n't say i 've read a copy of charlie hebdo so i ca n't really compare them . 
  thank you for your reply !, 
  while sometimes it 's nice to appreciate art without preconceptions , on the other hand i 'm not an expert , so i appreciate getting the symbolism explained to me . 
  memorials in the uk are mostly quite simple ( which is n't a bad thing ) , so it 's interesting to see something symbolic . 
  if any material is symbolic of european socialism , it 's concrete . 
  so i suppose it is fitting that their memorials are created in it . 
  i wonder , are they all meant to symbolise something ? 
  or were the artists / engineers just given free rein to do what they felt like ? 
  have you seen the whole south park episode ? 
  it 's a pretty good parody of religion and religious people , though it mostly mocks scientology . 
  i think you have to torrent it , because it 's been removed from most of the legal distribution websites due to the mohammed portrayal . 
  show : south park season : 5 episode : 3 episode name : `` super best friends '', 
  which means the the [ `` blaintology '' south park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/super_best_friends ) episode , remains the only actual [ animated cartoon protrayal of mohammed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfnxu0zeyjo ) , even if they did voice him with an am-dram impersonation of an indian accent . 
  except part of the reason that the uk did not join the schengen agreement in the first place was because it wanted to retain control of its borders , and so is well within its rights to refuse to admit non-eu migrants attempting to reach the uk from the eu . 
  the same reason the uk did n't want to join the euro because it saw the importance of retaining control of monetary policy during a recession ( especially after the black wednesday erm debacle ) . 
  surely it 's more consistent for a country to be against joining an eu program because it knows that there will be bad as well as good , than it is for countries to join up to schengen and the eurozone enjoying the benefits during the good times , and then try to walk it back when the agreement is n't so beneficial ? 
  personally i think the column is fairly sympathetic to the frustrations of the italian people in this situation . 
  though i suppose is very critical of the italian governments handling of the migrants . 
  i think telegraph has a monthly article limit . 
  well , istanbul is unambiguously in europe , at least . 
  the only reason there was a referendum on av was because it was a condition of a minority party ( liberal democrats ) joining a coalition with the conservatives . 
  most lib dems relaly wanted a proportional system , but av was a simple to implement compromise . 
  unfortunately by the time the referendum came about , their political `` brand '' was tainted by their many compromises , and the two major parties still did n't want it , so the lib dems were strongly identified with the `` yes '' campaign , and so they yes campaign was judged by many as if it were the lib dems . 
  the two biggest parties do n't want it , as it would be tantamount to `` turkeys voting for christmas '' as the saying goes . 
  they both get a greater percentage of seats than they get votes . 
  labour got an even bigger majority in 2005 with a similar percentage of the votes that the conservatives just got in 2015 . 
  a change to a proportional system would forever give up the ability of the two big parties to form a solo government with well short of a majority of the vote . 
  it 's even worse if we look at an actual proportional election ( the 2014 eu parliament election ) you can see that the two major parties only got 47.5 % of the national vote between them ( compared to 67.3 % in 2015 general election ) . 
  there are several reasons for this ( including the lower turnout ) , but one of the major ones is that part of the reason the two main parties still get the amount of votes they do , is because fptp biases voting habits toward bigger parties . 
  so , in summary , electoral reform ; was simply not properly debated on its own merits , the most powerful political groups wanted it to fail and even those who wanted a new system were n't particularly enthused by what was on offer . 
  there was a [ referendum on introducing the alternative vote system in 2011 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_alternative_vote_referendum,_2011 ) , however it failed , with only a 32.1 % yes vote on a 42.2 % turnout . 
  the public debate was n't particularly good . 
   just no .
