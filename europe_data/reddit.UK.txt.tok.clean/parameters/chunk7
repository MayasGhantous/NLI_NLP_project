  i said above : `` chinese is so easy , even chinese children can speak it . '', 
  to make a point . 
  same applies here . 
  a native speaker can not judge the difficulty of his language . 
  right , but that 's not the point . 
  we are talking about a second language for use between two people with different mother tongues , learned possibly late in childhood or as an adult . 
  a tonal language with a pictogram style written language is harder for someone whose mother tongue is not tonal and uses an alphabet type script . 
  granted , a japanese or korean person will find learning chinese languages easier than english , but those are a minority of languages spoken in the world . 
  europe , north & south america , much of africa , and quite a few other places beside have more in common with english than mandarin . 
   if we are talking about a simplified , basic english - ok . 
  but not the real language . 
  after a certain point , it is harder than mandarin . 
  this is exactly the point , learning english to the standard where two people can communicate at a basic level is easier . 
  perhaps learning the languages to the standard where you can appreciate the wordplay with double or triple meanings in film dialogue or literature might be different , but i 'm not sure that many people learn a language of convenience and business to that standard . 
  as tempted as i am to chide you with `` that 's what the french thought about their language '' . 
  i kinda of have to agree that it is hard to see where the replacement would come from . 
  even if china does massively eclipse the anglosphere in wealth and cultural output a hundred years from now , mandarin is just so much harder to learn to a conversational standard than english , and is so localised to china and its diaspora , i do n't see it giving much more than loan words . 
  the only thing that is likely to happen is english morphing into a different `` international english '' language as both the great majority of english speakers become non-native , and the majority of english teachers are non-native . 
  trying to talk english to an indian who has learnt english in india and spoke english only to indians is already challenging . 
   tynktura ( from french ? 
  latin ? 
  it 's certainly not native ) presumably that has the same etymology as `` tincture '' in english . 
  it comes from the latin `` tinctura '' . 
  actually , the queen could probably read a law written in french . 
  for her generation , french was important for a european royal to know . 
  [ here she is addressing the quebec legislature in 1964 , in which she extols the virtues of the french language . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4o5icxpvys ) . 
  true , they already have all the weapons they need , and food is n't going to be restricted , because there are a lot of cvilians there . 
  i suppose the difficulty for them will be replacing the troops after their deployment . 
  presumably russia needs to rotate the soldiers deployed in transnistria ( they will want to see their families at some point ) , and so to replace them will require the soldiers to travel falsely as civilians . 
  [ in the uk `` white goods '' is still a commonly used term to describe those kinds of appliances ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/major_appliance ), 
  i said many ( not all ) of those tanks were old , because so many of those 70,000 + tanks were t-55 or older . 
  for example the ussr ( which had the most new mbts ) had :  45,000 mbt js-2 and js-3 ( reserve ) t-10 / t-10m / t-54 / t-55 / t-62  10,000 mbt t-64 / t-72 / t-80 by 1981 , when this list was from , the t-54 & t-55 which made up the bulk of the warsaw pact tanks was definitely showing its age . 
  though of course in the west there were still a lot of m47 & m48 pattons , which were from a similar period , the ratio of these to newer tanks was lower . 
  the south east of england is actually pretty pleasant , no extremes of weather , and not too much rain . 
  if you compare the average amount of rain between [ london ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london#climate ) and [ ljubljana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ljubljana#climate ) , you 'll see what i mean . 
  wales is a bit different , with [ swansea as the wettest city in britain , apparently ] ( http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/soggiest-city-britain-pays-high-2440570 ), 
  well , `` outperforming '' implies that they competed and won . 
  there was n't really any equal conflicts of the hardware . 
  the only major tank battles of the period were in the middle east , but the armies using the hardware were n't equally competent , [ for example the valley of tears ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valley_of_tears ) there were two different philosophies between east and west when it came to tank warfare , so it is hard to directly compare them , since they were never really tested against each other . 
  for much of the cold war , the warsaw pact had far superior forces , at least numerically . 
  [ for example in 1981 , there were ~ 30,000 nato tanks , but ~ 70,000 warsaw pact tanks . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cold_war_tank_formations ) that is more than twice as many tanks in the east . 
  sure , many of those warsaw pact tanks were old , but many nato tanks were in north america , an ocean away from the front . 
  nuclear weapons are bad , and could still end civilization , but hundreds of millions died from conventional wars in the 20th century . 
  who knows how many lives were saved by nuclear weapons ( most likely ) keeping the cold war cold . 
  the funny thing is , tim hunt looks a lot like [ john mccririck ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_mccririck#/media/file:john_mccririck_2.jpg ) after a shave . 
  has anybody ever seen them in the same room ? 
  it was my understanding that due to the `` new normal '' of the way the us legislature was behaving , passing anything slightly controversial now needs a supermajority . 
  it was the reason why the aca was passed in the form it was ( the last version that was approved by the senate before scott brown was elected ) , rather than undergoing further refinements . 
  [ it does seem much harder to get even mundane things done , with statistics like nearly half of all executive nomination filibusters in the history of the usa having occurred under obama ] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/22/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-82-presidential-nominees-have-been/ ), 
  whether or not the criticism is justified , there is certainly some resentment about ireland 's role in multinational company tax avoidance . 
  [ for example ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement ), 
  pretty much , russia is the most populous european country , football is its most popular sport , and it has some excellent football clubs & sports facilities already . 
  similarly , even if brazil 2014 and south africa 2010 turn out to have been corruptly awarded , they are both deserving countries . 
  qatar is clearly the odd one out , the triumph of money over reason . 
  i thought the democrats only had a senate supermajority for about 6 months , once they got al franken and arlen specter , but then lost it after ted kennedy died and his seat was lost . 
  they used most of that time they had to work toward the aca . 
  [ cabinet collective responsibility ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabinet_collective_responsibility ) government policy is to renegotiate what they can with the eu , but to stay in the eu . 
  publicly campaigning to leave the eu while being in the government goes against cabinet collective responsibility . 
  you can argue that since referenda are not a traditional part of the british political system , we should not apply the traditional rules to it ; but strictly speaking , insisting on unanimous support in public for eu membership from the cabinet , is a completely normal thing to do . 
  only slightly relevant , [ but the different soil types of south east england are explained by it being an eroded dome comprised of several layers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_england_chalk_formation#/media/file:kentgeologywealdendomesimple.svg ),

  exactly , shoe-horning a token black guy into fantasy medieval poland would be a far worse ( and probably immersion breaking ) way of exploring race issues than by using human / non-human issues to tackle the concepts of real world white / non-white prejudice and racism . 
  it might ( not ) surprise you to learn that there is already a [ `` german unhappy with the punctuality of the british bus '' ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=202_1205849992 ) comedy sketch from the early 90s . 
  yes , it might mention the war ... 
  if there 's a german stereotype , there is a crass british comedy sketch of it somewhere . 
  the thing is , i actually have got quite used to squat toilets while travelling . 
  while ideally i would be sitting on a glorious gleaming porcelain throne amid the scent of roses , you have to accept that public toilets are n't like that in most places . 
  i 'd rather squat and take a dump down a hole , than have to deal with a nasty toilet that has n't been cleaned properly since it was installed . 
  [ it seems they are , they 're planning to get  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_navy#modernization_in_2018 ) * anti-ship missiles for coastal defence * 3x large corvette size ships ( 1900 tonnes ) * 3x submarines * 8x asw helicopters * 6x anti-mine vessels, 
  i think way back when the definition of the `` destroyer '' was created , it was `` torpedo boat destroyer '' , as in , supposed to tackle the small surface torpedo craft in the pre ww1 era , then it became mostly for anti submarine warfare ( asw ) in ww2 . 
  today , the definition is flexible , but it 's related i think mostly to tonnage ( ~ 4k - ~ 10k tonnes ) and blue-water capability . 
  their main role is as a missile platform , which can be anti-air , anti-ship , anti-land , and even anti-ballistic missile . 
  modern destroyers are mostly too big to be efficiently used for asw . 
  i think poland is looking to get some ( non-nuclear ) submarines , which make sense . 
  a few hidden submarines can keep any enemy surface ships out of the baltic sea , while being relatively safe themselves . 
  large surface ships do n't make sense for poland . 
  the article is about the relative performance of greece compared to other eurozone economies that were once having problems with borrowing . 
  [ if you 're unable to see the economist you can use the first free click off google method ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl#q=three+little+piggies+economist ) when the graph is just designed to demonstrate the difference in outcomes for the three countries ; getting worked up by which dollar / euro exchange is used , when the story is about greece 's exceptional problems , is a bit silly . 
  actually , germany shrinking their armed forces personnel is a good thing . 
  at the moment personnel costs are too large a proportion of their military spending . 
  as we saw in afghanistan germany needs a more capable professional army . 
  since germany is n't going to be invaded , it needs to move away from a large defensive army , and become a more capable and mobile army to be able to contribute to nato . 
  is n't the article stating that the onerous extent of the protections for workers is actually discouraging businesses from hiring permanent employees . 
   employers are deterred from creating permanent jobs by the uncertainty and costs of shedding them if they have to . 
  so they hire only on short-term contracts , reinforcing precisely the insecurity that the system of job protection was meant to avoid . 
  ** over 80 % of new hires in france are on contracts of three months or less . 
  ** while i am not sure about the context of that 80 % figure compared to other countries , and how many of those contracts lead to a more permanent position , but it does seem that ( especially for the young ) france 's determination to lead the way in worker protection , makes businesses that must compete in a free trade area wary about hiring workers to positions that enjoy those protections . 
  firstly , why did you leave off the second sentence ? 
  ** `` either because that was their intention , or because a peaceful safe country is unlikely any time soon . 
  '' ** because that is a key part of the reasoning .
