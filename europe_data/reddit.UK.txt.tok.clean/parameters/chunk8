  however , considering that these people travelled through as many as a dozen countries to reach their target country , spending their lifes savings to get there , do you really think they are going to head straight home as soon as the worst of the fighting is over ? 
  though if you had read the . pdf on the uk aid response in syria you could see that it is able to provide vast amounts of effective aid with relatively modest sums of money , by pooling their efforts with other countries including those neighbouring the country region . 
  i do n't think it is peculiar to think that it costs more to transport a refugee family to western europe , then provide them with ; food , housing , education , and healthcare in a region with one of the worlds highest costs of living , than to deliver it close to the conflict area . 
  sorry , i ended up with two posts after i rearranged the content . 
  so , when he writes a column , his words are beyond criticism ? 
  i do not feel his column addressed the issues of ; time-scale of refugees , validity of aid efforts directed to the region over bringing them into your own country , and the open ended nature of conflict driven migration . 
  somebody displaced by war is a refugee , but they can also be a migrant . 
  the european refugees of the 20th centuries world wars were mostly not permanent migrants , for example [ the majority of the huge numbers of belgian refugees of ww1 were able to return home ( or were `` encouraged '' to ) to a stable safe country after a few years of war ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28857769 ) these refugees from places like ; eritrea , somalia , south sudan and of course syria are unlikely to return to their countries any time soon , if ever . 
  for example in syria , the uk alone has donated generaously to help the refugees , both inside syria and in neighbouring countries , [ the dec ran its longest ever appeal ] ( http://www.dec.org.uk/appeal/syria-crisis ) raising # 27 million ( outside of the dec even more was raised for charity ) and the [ uk government has commited # 800 million so far ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/429892/dfid_syria_humanitarian_programme_summary_2015.05.26.pdf ) . 
  the rest of europe has spent even more . 
  ultimately , the columns writer , javier solana is being disingenuous in comparing the refugees of the world wars and the refugees of the ongoing civil wars : * the world wars were extraordinary events , nothing like them have been seen since . 
  there will almost inevitably be small and civil wars going on somewhere in the world at any given time . 
  since the end of the cold war the world is actually experiencing less war than in the past . 
  * unlike the refugees of the world wars , the majority of these refugees so desperate to reach europe intend to be permanent migrants . 
  either because that was their intention , or because a peaceful safe country is unlikely any time soon . 
  it is perfectly reasonable to consider their restriction along with migration . 
  * europe is spending vast sums of money to provide for the refugees where they are . 
  surely it is more efficient to spend this money in the region , where it will go further and help more people than spending huge sums just on those that manage to make it to our shores . 
  italy did n't , and they came third . 
  i thought they were very good . 
  by this point people in the uk just watch it for the commentary . 
  wogan quite successfully passed the torch to graham norton . 
  not everyone would agree with me on that , but i do n't care . 
  the best tonight was his comment on the german point announcer 's dress looking like a collapsed corrugated iron shed , that got me laughing uncontrollably for no reason . 
  while i recommend watching the whole video , the directly relevant part ( tobacco companies suing for restricting their branding ) starts at 6 minutes . 
  while a combined franco-german project makes sense , i wonder where that will leave the uk and italy , ( the other two western european countries with their own indigenous mbts ) , and of course all the other countries in the eu currently operating leopards , will they get involved ? 
  scotland actually has a bigger population than the republic of ireland ( 5.3 million to 4.6 million ) . 
  it 's just most most of them are concentrated in the central belt , and ( to a lesser extent ) the east coast . 
  [ if you look at a relief map , you can see why ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/scotland_topographic_map-en.svg ), 
  good to hear , the news about the roi economy has been good for a while now . 
  it 's taken long enough for that to be reflected in the unemployment figures . 
  military programs like the f35 spread themselves through [ literally dozens of states ] ( https://www.f35.com/resources/faqs ) to make them impossible for congress to kill . 
  iter is sited in france , so there are n't going to be many us voters out of a job if funding is stopped . 
  this makes sense from a point of view of political cycle short-sightedness . 
  the libyan civil war started in mid february , foreign intervention began on march 19th . 
  whether libya would be a stable peaceful country today had there been no western intervention , we can not know , but note that far more refugees getting on boats are from syria , ( a conflict which europe is not playing an active role ) rather than libya . 
  stating that libya is in chaos simply because of western intervention is dishonest . 
  the murdochs ^ ^ 2edgy4me, 
  also , afaik , the us exports equipment to israel on quite favourable terms ( as well as their own large indigenous arms and arms export businesses ) . 
  oh yeah , the american pronunciation , `` skwirl '' , fair enough . 
  though if you just speed up saying the two syllable version i guess it eventually turns into the american version . 
  maybe i 'm not understanding you right , but that is n't the division of the syllables , so it is quite easy . 
  you say `` skwi - rull '', 
  around 2011 , when the euro crisis was at its worst , a majority did want to leave the eu , and for long periods there have been a lot more `` outs '' than `` ins '' ( and undecided ) . 
  it was n't always so certain as now ( though i believe if there was a reasoned national debate , that would have changed to a `` in '' ) . 
  a major complaint of the `` out '' people , is that we have never had a national debate on handing political power over to the eu , and even the referendum on the eec was 40 years ago , when a majority of uk citizens today could not vote . 
  this issue will not go away , and if we 're honest , does actually have a lot of merit . 
  treaties like masstricht and lisbon were never put to a national vote , and all the major parties supported them . 
  ukip has been able to capitalise on this , receiving the most votes of any party in the 2014 eu elections , and despite the fptp system discouraging non-tactical voting , they just got 12.7 % of the national vote in the uk . 
  the conservative 's had to promise the referendum to prevent ukip taking votes from them ( a strategy the majority they have vindicates ) , but the argument of justice for a major constitutional issue stands up to reason , even if the result is a foregone conclusion today . 
  ok , let me just list this out : * every major uk party ( the conservatives included ) are for eu membership ( except ukip ) . 
  * the management of pretty much every uk media organisation is pro eu membership . 
  * both the eu and usa are for continued uk membership of the eu * every major uk industry is pro eu membership , including the influential financial sector . 
  * most importantly , [ far more uk voters want to stay in the eu than leave it ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/02/24/eu-referendum-record-lead/ ) barring some colossal calamity , the chance that a 2016-2017 `` in / out '' referendum will result in an `` out '' , are somewhat over-blown . 
  mostly there was legislation to restrain union power , here is a bbc [ article that discusses her legacy with respect to the unions ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3067563.stm ) specifically with regards to the miners , in the end she simply shut the mines down . 
  this was possible because the mining regions were pretty much all strong labour party constituencies ( no conservative marginals ) , and union sympathy had been exhausted among the broader electorate , especially by the so called `` winter of discontent '' ( what had brought thatcher to power in the first place ) . 
  while thatcher gets most of the blame for the crippling of the uk 's trade unions , arthur scargill ( the national union of mineworkers leader ) deserves a fair chunk as well for his bloody-mindedness . 
  unfortunately , most of the coal mining communities did n't really have anything else , and so the rapid nature of the pit closures mortally wounded a lot of these towns and villages . 
  the specific nature of the politics and mining industry of the uk probably means that the events here do n't transfer well to poland . 
   speaking to the belfast telegraph , mrs white , who is standing as an independent , denied that her views were extreme . 
  it seems she is n't standing for any party . 
   last may , mrs white stood for the new fermanagh and omagh council , receiving just 67 first preference votes . 
  ... and the people of ni are n't exactly voting for her in droves . 
  if someone is willing to lose their deposit , they are allowed to run . 
  there are plenty of reasons to bemoan ni politics , one crazy lady is n't one of them . 
  well rock star north is still based in edinburgh , so i reckon they could do a really good one set in glasgow . 
  though i 'm sure a send up of london would be harsh but funny as well . 
   ukraine is almost entirely united behind poroshenko in his pro-eu pro-nato policy . 
  and not `` oh just the west and kiev '' united , like every voting district but one united . 
  the eu was not the sole issue of poroshenko 's candidacy ( and nato was not as yet being discussed ) , a majority does not mean other points of view should not be respected , the main pro-russian candidates party ( party of regions ) was not functioning properly after the events of maidan , and the contested donbass region did not vote . 
  the reports of polls i could find give values for eu/cu support in [ march 2014 as 50 % eu , 31 % cu ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/more-than-half-of-ukrainians-want-to-join-eu-poll-shows/495753.html ) . 
  while nato membership support increased from [ 30 % in 2008 , to 40 % in april 2014 and 51 % in december 2014 ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/ukraine-inches-toward-nato-membership-not-likely-anytime-soon-analysts-say-1765996 ) ,  nothing personal , but this is a lot of `` could and would '' that 's based on a reality where there is n't great nationwide support for the position in question . 
  nato is a very polarising issue , yes , being against joining nato is now a minority view , but it is not a fringe view . 
  the argument to join nato is one of security , i argue that ukraine voting to join nato now decreases its security by fuelling the russian-backed separatists position . 
  what i am concerned about is that a nato referendum might be framed by both ukrainian nationalists and separatists as striking a blow against russia , rather than making a positive choice for the future direction and security of ukraine . 
  one of the key pieces of propaganda seen from russia is their linking the eu with nato . 
  fulfilling this warning from russian propaganda validates it . 
  while on the other side , the main `` benefit '' ( article five ) of joining nato can not be fulfilled because of the ongoing conflict being a barrier to membership being finalised . 
  holding a referendum now seems like a divisive action with no possibility of beneficial consequences . 
  absolutely , russia is the one in the wrong , but russia is n't the one thinking about applying to join nato . 
  one day nato may admit ukraine , but trying to bring that about when ukraine is in the midst of a civil war about looking east or west gives ammunition to the russian-backed separatist cause . 
  events like the recent murders of pro-russian figures in ukraine combined with a `` tyranny of the majority '' style of rule by ukrainian nationalists could sow the seeds of long term violence . 
  a vote for nato membership where it is framed in a negative way , as a `` fuck you '' to russia ( rather than ukrainians making a positive change for the future ) , would be badly timed . 
  the worst part about it is that poroshenko is using this as a divisive tactic , pandering to his own supporters while alienating ukrainians with a culturally-russian identity . 
  joining nato should not be a populist policy , it should be a solemn decision made with a cool-head , considering the risks of global nuclear war it carries with it . 
  one of the problems i hope ukraine can fix is the polarisation of its politics . 
  its people need a government who listen to the concerns of all ukrainians , not one that picks at old wounds in ukraine 's history relentlessly , from one side or the other . 
  it is a derogatory term for someone without mental functions , perhaps due to severe head injury . 
  as in , they have the mental capacity of a plant . 
  here is a fairly well known use if it as an insult to lampoon the conservative government in the 1980s http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dpzzge34yqy, 
  this calls for the traditional joke ... q : what is the toughest part of eating vegetables ? 
  a : the wheelchair . 
  i 'll see myself out ... 
  democracy simply means that power ultimately resides with the people . 
  i do n't think anyone disputes this is the ideal situation . 
  the way you achieve that is the difference , and it is far from perfected . 
  [ average pay is rising well above inflation ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32347960 ) also , the level at which you start paying income tax has [ risen massively since 2010 . 
  ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/personal_allowance ) from ~ # 6.5 k to # 10.6 k , so those on low wages pay a lower effective rate of tax . 
  germans are far too modest to do something like that . 
  like their respectful and reserved approach to the results of football games against the netherlands .
