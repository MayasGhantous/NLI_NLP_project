   the goal of unemployment is to reduce poverty . 
   what the fuck is the point of working if the working poors are on the rise ? 
  rising employment is good news . 
  while the circumstances could be better , i fail to see what is better about being poor and unemployed than being poor and employed . 
  good news , though for balance , productivity per worker is still a major issue . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31602582 http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q201.pdf, 
  was n't that because it was brought up by a caller during his annual q&a thing ? 
  at worst , that is evidence he is being opportunistic , i would n't say it is nefarious evidence . 
  well , the indochina war as well . 
  although most of the reasons for that was the political situation at home , rather than the failings of the french soldiers . 
  no problem , thank you for being civil . 
  i just do n't like feeling like someone 's straw man . 
  [ though it is looking like a particularly bad time to be against the current government in ukraine ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32337621 ), 
  / u/rabobi was stating that each and every one of the previous deaths is directly comparable in ambiguity to the open assassination of someone in front of witnesses , which was the specific part of the post i replied to . 
  that does not mean i believe these are suicides , in fact , i all but stated that it is likely the majority , if not all , of these deaths are murders/assassinations , by stating that at most one or two of the party of regions connected men might plausibly take their life , and referred to the `` suicides '' of so many in quotation marks . 
  i based my post on reading the op 's article ( which is sparse because breaking news tends to be sparse on firm facts , rather than speculation and misinformation ) , and the post i repied to . 
  if there is firm information that this death was a murder , sure that 's fine , and i hope that there is an investigation that finds all those responsible and not just the trigger-man . 
  however , do n't get sanctimonious with me just because i take issue with someone conflating a clear cut assassination with a list of suspicious deaths . 
   8 chances so far 8 failures to see anyone outraged that 's a bad comparison the key difference is nemtsov was repeatedly shot in front of witnesses by assassins , who may be connected to one of putin 's allies ( kadyrov ) days before he was going to lead a ( minor ) protest march . 
  of course there was going to be outrage . 
  these deaths in ukraine individually look like suicides ( you may even expect some suicides as people who were excessively corrupt realise their protection at the top is gone ) . 
  the news is while one or two suicides ( and a lot more people fleeing abroad ) might be expected , eight `` suicides '' is definitely very suspicious , but to call hypocrisy when murky a death fails to result in the same international outcry as an assassination is disingenuous . 
  in a way the fighting style was very old , the battle fought a few weeks earlier by harold godwinson at [ stamford bridge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_stamford_bridge ) was probably one of the last battles fought in the traditional style with both armies fighting as infantry with a shield-wall . 
  that said , the battle of hastings was actually fairly close . 
  it seems that the theme through all the pictures is of the equipment of an ordinary soldier , so you can see the change in equipment over time of the same role . 
  also i suppose that they chose the equipment of the local `` english '' soldier rather than the invading normans . 
  exactly , it is also very important we hear about the exploits of young british tourists in spain . 
  you would be shocked at the persecution they experience at the hands of the local police !, 
  right , but they were planning for armoured combat on a scale we ca n't comprehend today . 
  [ at the start of the 1980 's there were over 30,000 nato tanks and over 70,000 warsaw pact tanks . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cold_war_tank_formations ) . 
  once you add in all other light armour ( like the bmp ) , a `` conventional '' ww3 would have involved hundreds of thousands of armoured vehicles . 
  [ the modern tank forces of the russian army are much more modest , their military is far less concentrated on their western border , and the reserve tanks are even more obsolete . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_ground_forces#equipment_summary ) i suppose theoretically , the baltic states could form a joint armoured formation with poland , to benefit from economies of scale , but i do n't know if that is both mutually beneficial and politically feasible . 
  a country the size of estonia independently operating its own tanks would be comparatively expensive in unit costs . 
  if you do n't mind me asking ... 
  i 've always wondered how the russia-armenia-azerbaijan triangle kind of works as a stable situation . 
  is it a little bit like the usa-israel-egypt situation ? 
  where the peace between the latter two is engineered by the first . 
  note , i am not comparing nagorno-karabakh to occupied palestinian territories ( as the armenians in that area are not settlers ) , but just comparing the relationship between the three countries . 
  i think the difference here is that this is more exclusively a russian issue . 
  armenia is strongly russian backed , but russia is also a major supplier of weapons to azerbaijan , and is n't exactly hostile with their government . 
  the west does not really have a horse in this race . 
  azerbaijan does cooperate with nato , but is incredibly unlikely to be invited to join nato . 
  if azerbaijan did choose to attack nagorno-karabakh , it would receive no nato support in this . 
  you 're right in as much as the azerbaijani government probably wo n't pursue much more western-friendly policies because of the implicit threat of increased russian support for armenia over nagorno-karabakh if they do . 
  however , this is n't exactly an imminent threat . 
  yep , there 's more [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_dinner#united_kingdom ) . 
  goose is the previous tradition . 
  for all the cuts of britain 's armed forces , at least what they have is reasonably new and well maintained . 
  argentina 's has barely received any new equipment since the war , and what they have is falling apart . 
  [ i doubt argentina 's armed forces will be capable of even a modest invasion before the aircraft carriers are in service ] ( http://en.mercopress.com/2013/01/24/argentine-defence-minister-ashamed-of-the-santisima-trinidad-sinking-in-port ), 
  if you check the exchange rate of nok to chf , you can see that the norwegian krone has dropped sharply compared to the swiss franc . 
  the swiss dropped the euro peg in january so their currency was very high in february ( when these figures are from ) , while the norwegian krone has been falling a bit due to their currencies performance being linked to oil and gas prices , which have been falling . 
  the huge numbers of [ uk tourists ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-28418913 ) and [ uk migrants ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_migration_to_spain#social_issues ) to spain, 
  try telling them that . 
   [ the serbian government , the serbian list , the government of kosovo and the united nations all officially oppose the separation of north kosovo . 
  however , many serbs in the region were adamantly opposed to living under the rule of an albanian-majority provincial government and rejected an independent kosovo . 
  ivanovi\u0107 has spoken out against partition , pointing out that more than 60,000 ( 50 % ) of the serb population of kosovo lives south of the ibar , and that all of the important cultural and economic assets of the kosovo serbs are in the south of kosovo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_kosovo#2008.e2.80.932013:_assembly_of_the_serb_municipalities ), 
  the time it takes to design and build the new submarines is so long , that we need to commit by next year to the replacements if we want to have them finished by the time the vanguards reach the end of their life . 
   [ the final decision on whether to build the successor submarines will be taken in 2016 and the first boat will be delivered in 2028 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/successor_to_the_uk_trident_system#proposal ), 
  in which case ; [ the russians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rsm-56_bulava ) , [ the americans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ohio_replacement_submarine ) , and [ the chinese ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_094_submarine ) have already discarded the nnpt by your own definition . 
  the top 100 list was n't a scientific study and detailed appraisal , it was pretty much just a telephone poll . 
  because diana had died 5 years earlier and was still making news headlines on certain publications , she probably got pretty high just by name recognition . 
  ideally , the list would represent the beatles as a group rather than individuals , as they were greater than the sum of their parts , but anyway , we are getting away from the point . 
  which is that the adoration for diana is freakish and beyond all sane proportion . 
  i sort of agree , however , if you consider lennon as a surrogate for `` the beatles '' you can almost justify it . 
  what they did as ambassadors for uk culture and identity abroad , and as an inspiration at home , has had a colossal lasting legacy . 
  perhaps top 25 rather than top 10 , but the beatles should be represented quite high up . 
  to be fair though `` great '' in this context does n't mean they were pleasant , it just refers to the magnitude of their achievements . 
  after all the number one , winston churchill , presided over the probably unnecessary late-war bombing of german cities , and colonial repression ( for example in kenya ) . 
  the only person in the top ten who probably does n't deserve to be there is diana . 
  somebody already posted this radio programme a few days ago looking at the issue of english as both a native language and as a means of international communication with a combined factual/humour approach . 
  i 'll post it again http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05pbwjp, 
  i could agree with blair 's statement that this is a bad time to have a referendum , with so many other pressing matters that we ca n't afford to give the issue the time it deserves , but the way he said it , he seems to believe it should never be put to referendum . 
  he correctly said himself , that parties are not elected on the issue of europe , but on the issues of public services and economic policy . 
  where i disagree is while blair claims that means the electorate does n't care about europe , to me that is that the electorate has not been given a choice about europe . 
  none of the major parties are opposed to eu membership , and he did n't even give the uk a referendum on the lisbon treaty , when other countries like ireland did . 
  perhaps next year is not the right time , but i would like there to be a referendum on the issue , so that we can put the issue to bed , and move on . 
  which is why spain charges a much higher fee to access their health service for those of retirement age . 
   [ ** the basic monthly fee is 60 $ for the under 65s and 157 $ for those aged 65 and above ** . 
  however , prescriptions are not subsidised at this rate so you would pay 100 % of prescription costs . 
  this form of cover does n't give holders the right to an ehic at this time , so if you wish to travel , you will need to take out private travel insurance . 
  ] ( https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-in-spain#purchasing-public-health-insurance ), 
  it seems spain [ charges over 65 ] ( https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-in-spain ) s ( the uk retirement age ) $ 157 a month minimum for basic access to their health service . 
  it seems they have already planned for it . 
  i do n't know how much on balance it costs them though . 
  also , most of the battles in the rest of medieval europe were pretty small compared to the classical era as well . 
  most european populations were quite small , farming was comparatively low yield , and the ability to pay for and supply large armies was n't as good . 
  certainly for england , a lot of our famous battles with enormous impact on history were decided with relatively few english ( and welsh ) soldiers . 
  [ battle of hastings , where the normans won the deciding battle of their invasion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_hastings ) all the really famous english medieval victories over the french ; [ agincourt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_agincourt ) , [ poitiers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_poitiers ) , and [ crecy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cr%c3%a9cy ) [ battle of bosworth field , which decided the long `` wars of the roses '' civil war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_bosworth_field ) then of course for the scots , battles like [ stirling bridge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_stirling_bridge ) , and the [ battle of bannockburn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_bannockburn ) were tiny in the number of soldiers , but huge in impact . 
  i never said this was a problem , i was stating that directly comparing numbers of migrants , instead of types , is misleading . 
  the comment in this thread with the most upvotes is this . 
   i 'm tired of the british taking continental jobs . 
  we need stricter immigration laws and to push those islands away . 
  while this is a tongue in cheek comment , i do feel the need to point out why it is not entirely accurate , and that is what my comment was about . 
  also bear in mind that these  `` of the total , some 400,000 are british pensioners . '', 
  are actually taking their pensions out of the uk to spend in the country they have retired to , bringing more money to those places . 
  amusingly the government have only just scrapped the [ `` winter fuel allowance '' being paid by the uk to british pensioners in spain ] ( http://www.euroweeklynews.com/news/world-news/item/124776-winter-fuel-allowance-to-be-scrapped-for-expats-in-spain ) . 
  this is actually quite interesting . 
  when i saw it was henning wehn with the title i initially thought it was just going to be something silly , but it is actually an interesting look at the difference between english-english and english as a foreign language .
