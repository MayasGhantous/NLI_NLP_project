lol you 're gon na have to wait a while, 
  is `` le comeback '' a real thing ? 
  what are the chances that sarkozy will win the next election ? 
  yeah , it goes somewhere along the lines of - `` if you 're not a liberal when you 're 25 , you have no heart . 
  if you 're not a conservative by the time you 're 35 , you have no brain . '', 
  hate to be a naysayer , but should this really be something that 's up for a national vote ? 
  he also reinstituted slavery . 
  as a brit i just threw up in my mouth a little reading the title . 
  can confirm . 
  am fat british person . 
  so what your saying is ... 
  i should invest today !, 
  thanks man !, 
  you 're absolutely right but you 'll get nowhere on this subreddit with that opinion . 
  you 're probably right , i 'm just going off comments in / r/europe . 
  let 's be honest , of the all the first world nations the finns are * probably * the most racist . 
  i 've never ~ ~ invested ~ ~ speculated before . 
  would i be an idiot if i bought $ 1000 of shares in the bank of greece ? 
  e / alright , i 'm not going to invest in the nbg . 
  but i 'm going to watch it for the next few years and see how much i would have made/lost if i * had * invested . 
   here is a country that fought and won a noble war , dismantled a mighty empire in a generally benign and enlightened way , created a far-seeing welfare state - in short , did nearly everything right - and then spent the rest of the century looking on itself as a chronic failure . 
  this is so true and i 'm as guilty of it as the rest of us . 
  there 's a solid section of british society who would n't see this as sarcastic . 
  except for the food thing , nobody thinks we have good food . 
  yeah , that 's how i saw your comment too . 
  i do n't know why op 's overreacting . 
  crazy amount of italians have moved to the uk in the last 3-4 years . 
  it 's really depressing , most of them are better educated than the indegenous population but they 're working in gym 's and coffee shops . 
  not complaining though , the quality of coffee in london has been steadily increasing the last few years . 
  hey man , nice one !, 
  upvoted . 
   if anything we should kick greece out of the euro to fix a mistake we made a long time ago . 
  alright , this is why you guys are starting to get a reputation for not caring . 
  see , the way i see your point is that `` if you start a war , it 's okay to default on your debts '' . 
  yes the reperations were excessive . 
  everyone agrees that . 
  but the fundamental point is that germany was over-burdened with debt , and we collectively decided it would be better for all if we relieved that . 
  if they understood that in the 1950 's , why ca n't we understand it today ? 
   but greece already got the treatment that germany did with half of its debt forgiven and debt maturities extended to 10-30 years . 
  only for private creditor 's ( and not even all of them ) . 
  the german deal covered all debts , including those owed by the private sector and even individuals . 
  it also covered all creditors . 
  no one was allowed to `` hold out '' and extract greater profits than anyone else . 
  there was also a clause that said west germany should only pay for debts out of its trade surplus , and any repayments were ** limited to 3 % of exports ** earnings every year . 
  this meant those countries that were owed debt had to buy west german exports in order to be paid . 
  this is one of the reasons germany became the economic powerhouse it did . 
  in contrast to the 3 % limit on german debt payments , today the imf and world bank regard debt payments of up to 15-25 % of export revenues as being `` sustainable '' for impoverished countries . 
  the greek government 's foreign debt payments are around 30 % of exports . 
   most of these debts was because of being guilty for acts of war . 
  does that make it any better ? 
  i 've never understood why germany is so averse to debt relief - [ judging by their history ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/27/greece-spain-helped-germany-recover ) . 
  but it 's good to see they 're finally starting to change their tune . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitteleuropa#other_visions_of_mitteleuropa https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitteleuropa#the_prussian_mitteleuropa_plan, 
  that 's a very flexible term though is n't it ? 
  it has some historical connetations . 
  no one says central europe irl . 
  it 's either easern europe ( ex-warsaw pact countries ) , western europe or northern europe . 
  it 's worth noting that this is europeans on reddit think of * themselves * , so of course it 's going to be skewed . 
  i think it 's more that the german 's are n't used to it . 
  try being french or russian and you 'll get it on a daily basis . 
  i feel like the demands are going to get crazier and crazier until greece literally ca n't accept them . 
  that 's a lot of blue . 
  i mean , there 's a place for austerity . 
  the mistake was thinking it could solve the crisis all by itself . 
  it 's a shame , you guys had such a good run of being liked . 
  you can join france , britain and russia in our special little club . 
  confirmation . 
  it 's confirmation . 
  and we 'll wait and see . 
  no point jumping to conclusions . 
  yes , germany 's [ 1953 debt restructuring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_agreement_on_german_external_debts ) ended up so badly for them . 
  they really should have been taught a lesson . 
   and no-one is forcing greece to do this really ? 
  you can say that with a straight face . 
  `` alright greece you have two options . 
  accept stifling austerity for the foreseeable future and a debt burden that will last generations , or leave the euro and experience total financial meltdown and a humanitarian crisis . '', 
  it 's not even about party politics at this point . 
  it 's what 's ethically right . 
  almost every major economist has said greece 's debt is unsustainable and stifling the economy . 
  even major top-eu politicians have echoed this . 
  so what do we do ? 
  load more austerity . 
  if these are the people running the eu i 'm not sure i wa n't to be apart of it , and luckily my country is having a referendum on the issue in a few years time . 
  `` international observers have been telling us today that the package is likely to be so punitive that humanitarian aid can not be ruled out . '', 
  ~ ~ the germans were n't content with just wrecking greece 1941-45 . 
  it 's time for round two . ~ ~ it 's a joke . 
  we can keep squeezing greece until all the money falls out or we can invest in their economy and get it faster . 
  i 'm depressed now . 
  e / i 've crossed out the thing i think was probably a bit harsh . 
  i think my emotions ran high . 
  what exactly is a `` genocide '' ? 
  8,000 people just seems like a large massacre compared to the jewish or armenian genocides . 
  why 's everyone so bitter ? 
  good for russia . 
  [ how this conflict is starting to feel .
