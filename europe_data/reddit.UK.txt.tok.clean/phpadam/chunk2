  it means what we want it to mean - at the minute it means little . 
  elected leaders of each country is a democratic way . 
  lots of mep 's no one has heard of - with massive far-right elections opposing federalization across the eu failing to get voices heard - does not sound democratic . 
   who cares about cameron ? 
   it 's nothing to do with me we have a special relationship ; we welcome your input . 
  as we send british tv presenters to us to tell you about your gun laws ( then you kick them off your tv - very entertaining i might add ), 
  democracy . 
  those that have no idea tend to not to vote ; except in australia where its forced . 
  nope . 
   he actually had the decency to resign . . after he got caught out . 
  the decent think to do is to resign after doing something dodgy , not once everyone is pointing the finger at you . 
   the uk became a member . . for the common market . 
  not a federal state . 
  we like to be heard ; not to be dictators . 
   cameron made a mess of it an opinion held ; sure . 
  but only by many of those outside of the uk and those in the uk that oppose eu exit or renegotiation . 
  can we have a round of applause for the uk ? 
  . . no one would have known about jean-claude junker without david fighting to oppose him . 
  we made eu commission president relevant !, 
  ( or is it just uk that would n't ; i presume not ), 
   we wo n't give up any more sovereignty david ; suggests we have today with mep 's deciding on juncker and not each eu countries parliament . 
   fucking retarded government, 
   best to get rid of everyone who does n't support the union uk supports the union ; just not the direction its going . 
  as we seen in eu mep elections eu wide - its not just a uk issue . 
  very surprised at those countries with `` far right '' mep 's not to conceded a little . 
  i guess its because those `` far-right '' mep 's are not reprinted in this decision making . 
  whilst in the uk the conservatives are under pressure to re-gain lost voters . 
  in summery ongoing britain conundrum of free-speech vs hate-speech . 
   i would sacrifice uk not yours or any one oranisations to sacrifice ;, 
  what you saying ? 
  - it will be easier for reform ; as uk is asking for reform . 
  most ? 
  you should check the polls . 
  britain is not there to support pushing an eu message as you and others may want . 
  it is important but egypt to north korea . 
  tourist trap to hermit kingdom . 
  cameron should bring this up in a speech idealy in front of [ fake tower bridge ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2169266/tower-bridge-china-suzhou-builds-version-london-landmark.html ) `` i am eager for new chinese ambassador to britain being selected whom is as eager as we are to grow our mutual prosperity moving forward . '', 
  / dops microphone / kiss chinease baby / chinease students cheering ( david gave them free uk uni places ), 
   liu xiaoming ( born 1956 in jieyang , guangdong ) is a chinese diplomat currently serving as ambassador to the united kingdom . 
  he graduated from dalian university of foreign languages with a major in english and undertook further studies in the usa , obtaining a master 's degree in international relations from the fletcher school of law and foreign affairs at tufts university in 1983 . 
  [ 1 ]  between 2001 and 2003 , liu acted as china 's ambassador in egypt , and from 2006 to 2010 as chinese ambassador in north korea . 
  in 2010 he replaced fu ying as chinese ambassador in the uk . 
  [ 2 ] haha ; the guy has gone from egypt , demoted to north korea and now an ambassador to the uk . 
  its in his interest to talk up china and uk relations ; yet says divisive things such as this . 
  this is half of the issue ; 99 % of brits want `` good romanians '' but the gates are open to all romanians which is where the contention comes in . 
   `` i wan thtat country back '' you are in a statistical minority . 
  we rejoiced about a `` common market '' that was an illusion . 
   the island people are being stupid again, 
   england has to see , that the days of being a big empire are over , and they 're not special . 
  we got to work together , to make the best for everybody , as equals . 
  your trying to tell an englishman they are defeated ; to asimulate and give up . 
  to my reply to the question `` i really do n't get how you can not want to be part of the eu '' . 
  right . . `` just accept it '' is not relevant to what i said . 
  the opinion of british people is that british people know what is best for britain . 
  not to give up there opinions for the good of europe . 
  ( as you suggest ) i think you 've shown the issue at heart . 
  many in uk say ** no ** !, 
  look at 2014 stats on education , we cut it off . 
  china was pissed at us for stopping their children coming here for education . 
  cameron had to go to china and tell their youth we are open after this huge mistake . 
  we also closed down many `` fake '' schools in which students signed up too and paid but never went too , apparently to get into the country alas ; nigel says he does not oppose people coming here to educate or work and wants closer ties to the commonwealth . 
  unless the schools were full or the work not in demand . 
  this is where bnp slags them off for not ending all immigration . 
  with immigration numbers nigel also outlines he wants more immigration from outside of the eu as we apparently currently discriminate against them . 
  as with open borders with eu we have no choice of numbers ( and no real record of numbers leaving or entering ) so lower numbers elsewhere . 
  as for personal perspective ; i agree . 
  having a better wage in the uk than your homeland is great ; but that comes with increased costs , expenses and access to work in the uk . 
  half of uk 's immigration issue is the fallacy that the grass is greener here !, 
  as for the grass is greener ; this is a fact of an opinion for many countries . 
  ( see france/uk border issue ) . 
  for others such as new entrants they have closer ties and more in common with other europe countries ; so i do n't follow nigels suggestion that a lot can come - they prefer elsewhere . 
  nigel points out they can and says he would if he lived there . 
  comparing wages and standard of living . 
  not that they are en mass . 
   i really ca n't stand the man the german wife thing ? 
  your so intolerant :d, 
  find some sand and bury your head in it ; it will all go away soon enough . 
  uk likes the illusion of democracy , having germans , spaniards , greeks and others decide a small islands laws and policy 's do not make sense . 
  for mainland europe ; eu is great . 
  uk is on the fringes , its voice drowned by whats good for mainland europe . 
  most in the uk do n't want to be out of the eu ; they want a different eu that works for them , with so many involved in the eu project that is unpredictable and wont deliver what the uk is after . 
  too many voices to meet half way . 
   the conservatives are more ** big ** business oriented big business wants us to say in the eu , regulation keeps out the small guys but they use the trade argument . 
  small business ; hates bureaucracy and wants out . 
   26 million bulgarians and romanians ** can come ** here to take your jobs, 
  irrelevant ; people were still throwing petrol bombs . 
  who caused the `` main '' fire who knows there was loads of fires . 
  one guy in video i seen threw a molotov cocktail at a guy in a window trying to escape - he missed . 
  but . . 
  misleading headline , its a review of norway human rights . 
  they are requested to assess the situation and provide insight . 
  this is how the un works . 
  not crazy , you have a different perspective on nationalism . 
  for instance , id not want uk to be governed on such a large scale . 
  superiority ideology or perhaps protectionism perhaps taints me from calling myself european rather than british . 
   simon ** was ** the man ** is **, 
  its ok the register . 
  no need to apologise . 
  uk here : just found out due to invasion and wondering why countries not bordering russia was informing nato ( ? ), 
  they were worried .
