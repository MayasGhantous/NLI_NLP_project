  the good of the many outweighs the good of greece in those circumstances , ( not that im saying they dont try and help greece , just can not go too far because of their `` own '' circumstances ) so no , the fiscal union , or the absence thereof , is not irrelevant . 
  with interest rates as they are now , we are not out of it no . 
  . . but as we were able to set interest rates for our own niche circumstances - it was better than a monetary union . 
  the reason the uk did so well getting out of financial crisis , is the lack of a `` fiscal union '' . 
  it would be very unwise for countries to join the euro with its current record . 
  why is the article missing this point ? 
  the united states fiscal union , did not save ~ ~ boston ~ ~ detroit . 
  it would be different in the eu for spain ? 
  yes , the eu is not a democracy and until it makes directions in being accountable to the people . 
  a united states of europe is not something to be considered never-mind debated . 
  the problem with reddit , is you can only downvote something once !, 
  grr . 
  democracy is hardly ever funny . 
  united states of europe , is not something id politically support . 
  each to their own though . 
  if abusing powers was so bad the citizens should use impeachment . 
  rely on a 3rd party to take legal action against our elected government is not the right path . 
  providing uk citizens with information and guidance is brilliant , not legal action . 
   stopping cameron doing whatever he wants stopping our elected representatives from governing the country . 
  yes - keep down that road and we 'd be governed by europe instead of london . 
  that 'd be nice change form eu threatening to prosecute the uk . . 
  except , that 's probably the next step in this saga . 
  no idea what you just said . 
  boards ? 
  yer , til we lost any war by accident . 
  ahh were a member of the union is all . 
  yes , we need to nationalise dentists . 
  not been in many years , not because i 'm skint but such a dent in bank balance . 
  til ... but . . why would soviets want us to do that ? 
  obviously you have not watched the last episode of the top gear . 
  financial services are a big part of bradford , leeds and manchester to name a few . 
  a very large part of the uk economy . 
  ukip a party that does not know how to express its thoughts without a tint of racism . 
  of course he is right - the worst example is aid to pakistan to feed people - pakistan the biggest recipient of british overseas aid , whilst pakistan 's space program has a budget of $ 75.1 million . 
  lol , the meaning is how fast do you want to fall . 
  uk unemployment fell by 57000 to 2.51 million in the three months to may . 
  it would seem the far off future is getting further away if we keep going at this rate . 
  i understand all of what i said , and your change of topic to a far off future but our unemployment rate is not as high to be a tipping point of what you suggest . 
  bearing in mind employment continue to move to service industries . 
  cost of living will reduce due to automation that 's for sure , many will continue to be made unemployed . 
  i do n't see any `` near future '' were reasonable people would not still need or want a job . 
  no one tell 4chan, 
  job center plus will help you out no problem , may need free training to learn english first and of course ict skills . 
   ** largest part of their voting base **, 
  not just borris and dave , the whole cabinate is upper-class high educated people . 
  their not too bad but it is a formula that often has a bad outcome . 
  nothing wrong with not having a job if your self-sufficient . 
  taxpayer subsidized living is for those that pay back in - its an insurance we pay in , ** in case ** we need to take out . 
  hi their mr american , nice to have you here . 
  temporary data protection law introduced to prevent the use of us cloud services , which based in the us servers or controlled by us firms . 
  that should shake the tree a little and give europe it a little boost too . 
  amazon uk may have to file some tax returns then , as they rush to establish europe data centers and oust us shareholdings . 
  of course they wont do this , without a few years of good talks of which by the end of it we have forgotten or `` dealt '' away with this issues . 
  if your leaders want you to jump of a cliff , its a good idea to take your rucksack full of bricks off beforehand . 
  til : russia is in europe . 
  i need re-cap my geography . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial#germany not in private it seems , only disturbing the public peace , aka public incitement . 
  even then would have to incite hatred or insults someone . 
  . . dont know how relevent that would be to david irving . 
  never heard of the fool . 
  thanks for the informative insight . 
  answer : sorry its covered by official secrets act . 
  built proof , germany is suddenly scary again . 
  when the prime minister of a democracy country is no longer in charge of their own borders , their is an issue . 
  then again cameron wants to deport assange , so i get your arbitrarily deport specific persons argument . 
  today i learned . 
  the uk government on the other-hand , has a website advising people : ** uk 's guide whistleblowing ** https://www.gov.uk/whistleblowing/overview my favourite is - how to ` blow the whistle ' . 
  least favourite is bit where legal protection ends for those that signed the official secrets act in relation go this topic , in general a good idea though . 
  rabble , rabble , rabble . 
  we are very bad at getting people out of our country . 
  the public interest disclosure act 1998 provides a framework of legal protection for individuals who disclose information so as to expose malpractice and matters of similar concern . 
  what a headache . . 
  us would rather it get out off the spotlight i think . 
  my guess is uk govt want to please the us except if they let him in - the uk public will be angry if they extradite him ... uk would have a bad time deporting him though as the courts can rely on the ** public interest disclosure act 1998 ** . 
  that would put the road to extradition on a long , long path . 
  public interest disclosure act 1998, 
   in the united kingdom , the public interest disclosure act 1998 provides a framework of legal protection for individuals who disclose information so as to expose malpractice and matters of similar concern which is why i think they blocked him . . 
  it 'd be a mess to try and get out of that , to send him back to a'merica . 
  and we 'd end up another lodger in equidor embassy . 
  the european court of human rights , authorised by the european convention on human rights which was drafted by the council of europe . 
  which uses the same flag as the euopean union . 
  i wonder if theirs is a reason somewhere that people get confused . 
   it 's pretty bad for any 1st world nation to be withdrawing from a human rights convention its never bad for a 1st world nation too listen to the public in a democracy . 
  democracy is greater than courts . 
  disappointed in my government . 
  aka , something for nothing . 
  foi request should get it , if not . 
   bloody hell why i 'm trying to advocate for ukip voters here i do n't even know too tired for coherent reply but have comfort that you did make me laugh . 
  not sure about nigel . 
  i know one of ukip 's members is on a banking committee and did not attend very much . 
  he made his point on video at the eu , if you would like me to find ? 
  i think it was on the lines of the mini debates on minor issues is pointless when the whole system is flawed due to x and y. . . 
  i guess nigel is on the fishing thing , for same reason . 
  he wants to change it completely not debate tiny things about it . 
  so he waits for the actual debate , as a committee member has a voice . 
  those are the reasons they give ( i think ) for not attending . 
  for not giving the money back , no idea . 
  i guess nigel laughs and thinks of it as a rebate for all the money the uk puts in . .  wasting a spot that very much an opinion , i imagine most anti-europe supporters would be backing nigel for 100 % attendance and slow the debates down further . 
   does nothing but being a nuisance and obstructing it 's work yer , thats his purpose ... 
  he wants to obstruct the eu from taking more powers and intruding further .
