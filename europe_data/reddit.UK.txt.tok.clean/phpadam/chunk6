   `` there '' and `` they 're '' not `` their '' just pointing that out . 
  [ the british dyslexia association ] ( http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/ ) just pointing that out . 
  lol - your saying you trust ukip to understand laws if they are their ? 
  i think its a moot point to be honest . 
  cost of travel is not an issue i rose , but would save on those costs . 
  as i dont think wage includes tavel - travel is extra . 
  perfect example , amelia . 
  she is representing her country whilst living in brussles - very much `` in with the people '' listening to views and takeing on her publics opinion . 
  no - she would benefit from remote work . 
  why has the uk not done it ? 
  . . well they do have proxy votes but to be honest we are tiny arnt we . 
  europe is massive and remote voting woudl be a great feature of government . 
  i 'd pull back a little and ensure theirs some commitment to irl visits to brussels , but for most of votes remote would work well . 
  translators is not much of an obstacle , they all have headsets and seat numbers . 
  who ever organises that can ensure the translator is patched to the right voip connection . 
   he bloody knew it would be a job he 'd be spending quite some time in brussels for he did and that 's not the point i make ... 
  he does not want to be their but has to do so for his commitment to be anti-eu . 
  you understand im not making a point that the poor guy has to go to work , lol . . 
  the point is ukip has to attend a group of which they protest . 
  similar to the green party , sat in british petroleum conference room debating the oil output for this quarter and looseing every time . 
  thats got to be a drain . 
  in a virtual political chamber . 
  thats what we 're discussing captain obvious . 
  perhaps , but who knows . 
  imagine how much effort it would be for a eurospeptic to have to go to brussels to vote and debate . 
  when they get their they know their up against the united states of europe and are the wierdos that are sat in eu parliment but are against the eu . . wtf ... now the effort to sit in their home office and be a eurosceptic from their armchair - a lot easier ... nip over for the big votes and debates . 
  sorted, 
  what you think they 're going to travel to brussels to listen or read everything that comes with it at a hotel . 
  they should be able to work remotely , i do n't follow your point ? 
  unless its ukip policy to use dialup internet , should n't be an issue . 
  eu 's own fault , should let ukip vote via internet . 
  i mean come on its 21st century . 
  re : blockade - protesters blockaded taxi to prevent the politicians exit . 
  ( source telegraph ) re : racist - 50 nationalists demanding that he : `` go home to ** england ** '' ( source telegraph ) re : peaceful - officers then insisted for his own safety that he enter the canon 's gait pub ( source telegraph ) -- listen , i do n't care if people protest or even blockade the van . 
  im all for free speech so can be racist to him in public as far as i care , the law may differ . 
  this is a party wanting uk independence , not just british independence . 
  the fact is that is tainted is because ukip started in england . 
  the fact that as telegraph puts it `` officers then insisted for his own safety that he enter the canon 's gait pub , the wooden doors of which were then locked . '', 
  shows the police thought this was not peaceful . 
  protesters had a point to make , and they made it . 
  it played well into the hands of nigel and gave ammo to him that some want scottish independence from england and not `` scottish independence '' . 
   their was racist chanting  police were called to protect a politician  they were beating the van http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=e1b_1368734268  blockaded the police van you !, 
  ftfy - `` just how desperate ** am i ** to portray the protest as peaceful '' their was racist chanting , police were called to protect a politician , they were beating the van and blockaded the police van . 
  have no doubt this played into the hands of ukip supporters . 
  define : peaceful - free from disturbance ; tranquil . 
  the initial obstruction of the police was not peaceful , moving after an officer demanded is just negating arrest . 
  only seen a clip but banging windows of a police vehicle is peaceful ? ... 
  id tend to think police would argue the opposite if i tried that . 
  nice , thanks for the market research . 
  i now know where to open investment bank and were to open a pay day loan company . 
  [ the british dyslexia association ] ( http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/ ), 
  england here . 
  your in a minority , long live the queen . 
  he could have polished his shoes . 
  time to leave the eu , if you can not stimulate and force an industry to boom without starting ' a subsidy grace 's . 
  erm ; being in bradford ( hi ) it is rolling clouds , very windy and was raining this morning . 
  / r/bradford /, 
  who was that ? 
  sounds like a fun story . 
  how i first seen the photo : http://i.imgur.com/uokdmtm.gif, 
  except for the uk , which is a public listed company i belive . 
  uk plc ? 
  care to explain why lower tax 's are not better for british ? 
   it is most certainly not in the best interest of nations collectively its better for britain , this is a british budget not an eu budget . 
  this is in the best interest of the british . 
  the 10 % tax is because their banks are about to collapse , so your solution is to tax them more and make sure they do n't have other ways to monetize their service . 
  i do n't follow how this solves anything ? 
  the 10 % tax is for savers , the people you want in your banking system . 
  is the bailout not a biproduct of borrowers not savers . 
  would it not be more logical to add 10 % to everyone 's loans/credit ? 
  i wonder if this will effect fbme , the offshore bank used by many arround the world . 
  eu spends way too much on translation ; that being said . 
  seems like an insult to the maltese prime minister that they permitted him to talk in the first place without the adequate resources for others to understand . 
  i 'd not say he made a scene , he made a valid point . 
  google translate can do it for them , its just some fancy frame and their ads still show . 
  gr8 suggestion . 
  if its china centric , but if eu are heavily involved us should be ok . 
  us do n't like the mystery and eu leaks worse than my toilet . 
  if you want real answers , post them to http://www.asktheeu.org/en, 
  preime minister stands up to eu , gets called `` scaredy-cat '' . 
  all logic in spiegel article is out of the window - nice title though it got me reading . 
  +1 pageveiw, 
  he may want to stay in the eu , he has though guaranteed a referendum . 
  that being the point , no need for ukip supporters to give a protest vote as cameron is giving them a referendum . 
  what was david recommending the eu to do ? 
  the only suggestion i heard was the open market should include telecommunications business . 
  what is his `` demands '' ? 
  am i right in thinking if europe gives david everything he wants , we still get to vote yey or nay ? 
  nice speech to stop the inflow of supporters to ukip . 
  now people who are anti-europe no longer have to give protest vote to ukip but instead vote the blue back in - to get the referendum they want . 
  de'ja vu , europe sticking knife in back of uk for opposing views on its direction . 
  rising support for nato has something to do with current tensions with russia . 
  the eu expansionist programme is in part a catalist ; whilst not the blame for the shift in attitutes in ukraine to the west . 
  politicians love the eu . 
  democracy ; we like to blame people and hang in shame them when it goes wrong . 
  in the eu you get none of that ; too big to fail and no accountability . 
  with most of uk laws ; now being made outside of our parliament . 
  then our influence in eu not matching our perceived superiority . 
  whichever has the biggest and most polar sample . 
  is the tuth ; unless thers another with a bigger and more polar sample then that is the tuth ... well . . until , there is some form of campaigning then its all turned on its head .
