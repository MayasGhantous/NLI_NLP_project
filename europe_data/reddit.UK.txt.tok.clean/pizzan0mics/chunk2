  i was in wroclaw not even a week ago and found myself in the middle of a massive parade of people singing and holding crosses and praying on the floor every couple of minutes and waving candles . . all whilst walking around the centre of the old town . 
  absolutely no idea what it was , but there must have been 300-500 people in the ` parade ' . 
  i 'm convinced the only people not involved in walking around with it were tourists .

  as a brit studying modern languages at university , yes , you definitely should learn a language . 
  it 's never too late to start . 
  it will broaden your mind , introduce you to a new culture , and make you smarter . 
  might even pay off in the world of work . 
  mess around with some of the courses on duolingo and see what you like and sub to / r/languagelearning !, 
  it 's okay , we can always ask you guys to try and pronounce the word ` squirrel ' . 
  literally nobody learns languages . 
  which is sad , languages are fun and open up so many doors and possibilities . 
  i study german , dutch and russian at university , it 's great . 
  it 's hard but everyone is always really impressed when i tell them so i get a little ego boost too ... 
  i did it , it 's amazing .

  yep , born and inbred . 
  i 've seen more of europe than i have of the uk . 
  i 'm from norwich and been all over norfolk and seen most of suffolk . 
  currently live in sheffield . 
  i 've been to wales for about 30 minutes . 
  only been to london twice and a few other cities and handful of times . 
  i really need to see more of the uk . 
  its incest . 
  a teacher in my middle school married her cousin , that was odd . 
  but then again i am from a part of the uk supposedly ` known ' for incest . 
  currently in my first year of a ba in modern languages ( german , dutch , russian ) . 
  in the off-chance anyone from the university of sheffield is reading this , come here : / r/uos, 
  this is correct .

  whereabouts in norfolk ? 
  i lived on the coast by cromer for the first 19 years of my life ( moved to sheffield for uni in september ) and over half the people my age i know have a very thick norfolk accent . 
  i would even go as far as calling it a dialect as a lot of the forms of verbs change too , especially the way that my parents speak .

  sheffield , uk ; * the harley * bungalows and bears * mr miyagi 's sushi bar * luckyfox * proove pizza all of these places are worth checking out if you happen to be in sheff . 
  here are some other restaurants/food chains i 've been in across europe that really stood out to me ; * utrecht , ndl - meneer smakkers * stockholm , swe - vig\u00e5da * munich , ger - hans im gl\u00fcck * budapest , hun - kolbice * copenhagen , den - the laundromat cafe * helsinki , fin - friends & burgers as you may be able to tell . . 
  i like burgers . 
  can vouch for utrecht . 
  was planning on staying in amsterdam for 4 nights whilst interrailing . 
  ended up staying in emergency last minute accommodation in utrecht for 4 nights and got the train to amsterdam on the second two days . 
  i 'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason . 
  utrecht was a million times better than amsterdam .

  i 'm just going to copy and paste a comment i made when someone asked about slovenia a few months ago . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5069hh/europeans_what_do_you_think_about_slovenia/ ) was the thread if you 're interested and want to see a few more answers . 
   i know nothing about slovenia other than going to ljubljana whilst interrailing , where i found out that your people are extremely hospitable . 
  story time . 
   my ex and i ( 18 at the time ) were couchsurfing with a 30yo couple who picked us up from the train station at 10pm at night . 
  we 'd been on the train from budapest for about 8 hours and had n't eaten , so when we got into the house they 'd prepared some food for us and we stayed up , had a nice chat and went to bed . 
  in the morning they had to go to work but gave a load of booklets for us to look at for something to do before giving us a lift to tivoli gardens , and we walked into the city from there . 
   unfortunately my ex suddenly got extremely ill ( no idea why , we think it was from some food in budapest - nothing at all to do with the hosts ) so we had to run around the centre of ljubljana with her crying and trembling and feeling awful , going into chemists trying to find specific tablets and contacting our couchsurfing hosts and finding a hostel to stay in and pestering the tourist advice centre down by the triple bridge with my frantic english which they tried so hard to understand . 
  all the people that we came across that afternoon were unneccesarily understanding , sympathetic and helpful to two stupid ( and one seriously ill/homesick ) british teenagers , and all those complete strangers went above and beyond what i would have even expected from close friends . 
   at the time i was shitting myself thinking that it would ruin the whole trip and i had no idea if we 'd even find a spare room in a hostel , let alone a nice cheap room with an ensuite and tv and food included . 
  but i will always look back fondly and happily when i think of slovenia/ljubljana , even if i technically had the worst time . 
  i feel the complete opposite . 
  to me all we have in common with those countries is that we use the same language ... 
  nothing else . 
  if you did n't sit in the park on a friday night with a few cans of white lightning when you were 14 , were you even a teenager in the uk ? 
  come to sheffield , plenty of places around here that sound like what you 're looking for . 
  so many good cafes and independent restaurants it 's unreal . 
  yes . 
  north : bergen , norway ( 60 \u00b0 39 ` n ) south : hammamet , tunisia ( 36 \u00b0 40 ` n ) east : helsinki , finland ( 24 \u00b0 56 ` e ) west : gibraltar , gibraltar ( 5 \u00b0 21 ` w ) highest altitude : kanzelwand , germany/austria ( 2,058 m ) lowest altitude : no idea , possibly amsterdam , the netherlands if it 's below sea level ? 
  i like germany , i love the german people , and i can speak german . 
  it 's not . 
  most people in the public , or at least people in my social circles , have a strong dislike for saudi arabia . 
  most are indifferent to iran . 
  when i think of eurodance these are the first songs that come to mind ... 
  so probably one of these . 
  even though i hate them .

  german . 
  now i 'm doing german , dutch and russian at degree level . 
  glad to see some love for ashens , very underrated in my opinion . 
  he 's also from my neck of the woods so it 's nice to see him reference or get excited over local things . 
  i prefer his food specials over some of the reaaaaaaally nerdy videos he makes though .

  we do n't end up leaving the eu . 
  same for me , on the north norfolk coast . 
  i moved to sheffield for uni in september and we had a tiny bit in november but that 's it . 
  nothing special , at least in my family/house . 
  / r/languagelearning is this way , 
  god , i went there when i went interrailing and it was one of the worst places i think i have ever visited in my life . . 
  anyway . . [ bath ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bath,_somerset ) , [ cheltenham ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cheltenham ) , [ york ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/york ) and [ norwich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwich ) are all worth a visit in the uk in my opinion . 
  smaller places on the continent ( well . . places that are n't capital cities ) i 've visited that i 'd recommend are ; * [ bergen , norway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bergen ) * [ utrecht , the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/utrecht ) * [ kaufbeuren , germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaufbeuren ) * [ rothenburg ob der tauber , germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rothenburg_ob_der_tauber ) * [ mijas , spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mijas ), 
  uh oh , looks like the kids are on their christmas holidays !, 
  i think you got lost on your way to / pol / mate . 
  it 's not as difficult for me as you would think since i 'm familiar with both concepts having studied german , it 's just very tricky knowing specifically which endings to use ( something which took me forever to get my head around in german ) , plus the fact that its all in a different alphabet ) . 
  russian has several cognates with german though which helps a little bit . 
  having said that however , as much as russian is a fun language to learn i think i 'm going to stop after the end of this academic year because it 's just far too hard to do exams in alongside 2 other languages . 
  i would imagine that someone who has studied a slavic language before would find it a lot easier , and someone else who has only studied languages without cases/declension/gender would find it a lot harder . 
  native english speaker , just turned 20 . 
  in my high school we were offered german or french and were put into a random class in year 7 ( ages 11-12 ) , and the last compulsory year was year 9 ( ages 13-14 ) . 
  i took german for my gcses and a levels , and now study it at university alongside dutch and russian . 
  i can also ( well , used to be able to ) speak a tiny bit of finnish after travelling there and falling in love with helsinki , which i swear is all i ever mention on this sub , but i put it on the backburner after i started university . 
  other than people on my course or friends from other countries i do n't know anybody than can even speak a tiny bit of a foreign language . 
  it seems like people who took a gcse or even an a level mfl have all but forgotten the language regardless of what language it was . 
  which is pretty sad .
