  i 'm not a massive film person at all really , so i 'll just offer one . 
  [ shaun of the dead ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j02-btz1bxe ) . 
  i find it a bit cringe when your politicians go on talk shows . 
  like seriously , wtf is all this about clinton trying to open a jar of pickles ? 
  has she really not got better things to be doing ? 
  i remember seeing footage of david cameron on a us talk show recently ( could n't tell you whose show it was , they 're all identical to me ) , and it was just so horrible to watch . 
  i was n't the biggest fan of cameron , far from it , but damn i felt sorry for him and i could tell that he really did n't want to be there . 
  the last time i remember a recognisable , big-name politician doing a talk show in the uk was , funnily enough , david cameron doing something with jonathon ross well over 10 years ago now , back when he had only just became leader of the tory party ... and even that seemed odd . 
  native english . 
  can speak german relatively well for a brit , not even close to fluent though . 
  going to uni in september to carry on with german as well as start both dutch and russian too . 
  i 've also dabbled in finnish but it 's way too hard . 
  something something , vittu suomalainen perkele . 
  never heard it here . 
  however when i went on exchange to germany ( bavarian swabia ) nobody used it there either , although `` tschau ! '', 
  was used by almost everyone i met for ` hello ' and ` good bye ' . 
  no idea what i just watched but it 's now stuck in my head . 
  they are two separate things !,

  [ cadbury 's creme egg ] ( http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4963022.ece/alternates/s615/main-creme-egg-uproar.jpg ) . 
  well after eating one last summer that was enough for me . 
  it was the blue packet i think , hot and sour ? 
  absolutely disgusting . 
  yeah , i remember watching wrecklesseating eat a whole care pack of finnish sweets and they tried the tyrkisk peber at the end and threw up . 
  gross . 
  i did n't get to try any m\u00e4mmi which was a shame . 
  apparently that 's disgusting too ... like i said i drank so much lonkero and it was incredible . 
  i also tried reindeer soup , and got some salmon with whitebait and lingonberries from the outdoor market by the harbour - beautiful !, 
  when i was in helsinki last year i tried some tykisk peber . 
  and i nearly threw up in my mouth . 
  edit : however i did also drink lots of lonkero , so swings and roundabouts i guess . 
  i went interrailing last year and went through about 12 countries and 14 cities in one trip , staying in each city at least 3 days ( between 3-5 ) . 
  i would say that i 've experienced europe - but i live in europe so it 's quite easy to go back again as well as visit regions i did n't go through ( mainly the balkans ) . 
  i would n't say i 've experienced each of the individual countries i visited on that trip though which the exception of one or two countries which i had previously visited or went to more than one city in . 
  at the end of the day though who even cares ? 
  i mean , my trip does n't make me a better person than someone who stays in one city for two weeks and vice versa . 
  travelling is all about going where you want and the way you want . 
  if someone has only been in a car through the netherlands does it matter if they say they 've been there ? 
  or did they need to eat stroopwafels and smoke some weed for it to count ? 
  not 100 % true - no idea about olive garden ( i 've never heard of it full stop ) but sheffield , uk has ** two ** taco bells !, 
  are you in helsinki ? 
  when i visited last year i was really impressed with the tram network . 
  more cities in the uk need trams !, 
  probably a bit of an anomaly being a british person who likes languages . 
  native : english very well : german learning : dutch , russian , finnish ( i should point out that i 'll be studying dutch and russian at university - alongside german - so technically i 'm not learning them * yet * . 
  finnish i can understand basic nouns but ca n't really structure anything myself , i started learning it after i got back from a trip to finland after falling in love with the culture and the country but it 's so difficult and i 'll probably have to stop and give more attention to the languages i 'll be studying ) through knowing both english and german i 've found it super easy to read dutch ( listening to it is something else entirely ... ... ... ) having done no actual learning of the language before . 
  when travelling around scandinavia i also found it relatively easy to read signs , menus , adverts etc. 
  in danish/norwegian/swedish although actual , worthwhile chunks of text i could n't understand at all . 
  i love learning languages and find language in general very interesting so nowhere would be closed off to me purely on a language basis . 
  not exactly relevent , but did you do russian ab initio ? 
  if so , how is it ? 
  i 'm starting a language degree in september ( german and ab initio dutch ) and if i have leftover credits i 'm tempted to do ab initio russian . 
  i 'd have a choice from loads of other languages but russian interests me the most so i 'd have the most motivation to study it , but i do n't know if it will be too much on top of my other two languages . 
  yep , i went interrailing last summer with my now-ex . 
  best thing i have ever done in my life and probably will ever do for quite a while . 
  video of all the places i went [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjfs7bao1jc ) . 
  i started my journey in scandinavia . 
  if you want to go to helsinki/turku/anywhere else in finland then you 'll probably be best getting the ferry to/from stockholm - you can go all the way round the top through lapland but that will take so much time . 
  unless you want to go there ( and consequently knock off time for other places ) then it 's win/win . 
  visiting places in norway will be a bit of a hassle mainly because you 'll most likely have to change at oslo to get to somewhere , and then go back on yourself to go back to oslo and leave norway . 
  again it 's not a huge problem but you do n't really want to go back on yourself because it wastes time . 
  any questions - ama . 
  ] ( http://m.wikihow.com/play-kerby ), 
  based on what ? 
  i can think of a few countries i 'd give a 0 for in some cases and a 10 in others . 
  besides i only really have opinions of the countries i 've visited in europe - around 15 or so . 
  i live in rural [ norfolk ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/norfolk_uk_locator_map_2010.svg/2000px-norfolk_uk_locator_map_2010.svg.png ) , the wales of england . 
  * we 're one of the only counties in england that does n't have a motorway going through it , and we have a very heavy accent that [ differs quite a lot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norfolk_dialect ) from standard english ( [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sifbgperujg ) - starts at 0:18 ) which people always seem to confuse for a [ west country accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=berf_kpu5fw ) . 
  * despite looking like we 're quite close to london , norwich ( our ` capital ' of the county ) is very isolated from the rest of the uk , and rural norfolk is even more so . 
  * norfolk is also very flat and is home to one of the best national parks in the uk , [ the broads ] ( http://www.enjoythebroads.com/ ) . 
  * everybody that lives here has no ambition to ever leave for some reason . 
  personally i ca n't wait to get out of here . 
  it 's a nice place but it 's such a dead end , literally . 
  * we 're also usually the butt of jokes relating to incest . 
  not sure why . 
  * also i actually live about 45 minutes away from norwich , yet i pretty much have to say that 's where i live since it 's the only chance i 've got of people knowing where i live ( plus where i actually live is a bit too small and i 'd prefer it if people did n't know exactly where i lived anyway ) . 
  i quickly found out after going to uni that even loads of people from the uk have n't heard of norwich . 
  *** noteworthy places : *** ** norwich ** - capital of the county as previously mentioned . 
  home to one of the largest markets in the uk and possibly europe . 
  also home to the second tallest cathedral in the uk . 
  it was once the uk 's 2nd largest city but other cities became much bigger a lot faster for some reason which i do n't know - before cars and planes were a thing it was quicker to get to amsterdam than to london from norwich . 
  it 's a nice place , yet very isolated . 
  ** great yarmouth ** - total fucking dump , full of chavs and people who have nothing to do but cause trouble in the town centre because there 's no opportunities here . 
  lots of drug addicts . 
  once boasted about having one of the worst teenage pregnancy rates in europe . 
  it 's got a pier but it 's not very good . 
  there 's a greyhound racing stadium here . 
  ** cromer ** - nice coastal town with a very small pier . 
  famous for its crabs . 
  ** king 's lynn ** - i actually know nothing about this town so you 'll have to look on wikipedia . 
  i 've only been there once because it 's very far away . 
  my school spent most of its budget on the construction of new buildings , at least while i was there anyway . 
  we got a new computer room which was cool so i suppose that might fall under laptops/ipads ? 
  the teachers were great when i was in year 7 but there was a huge shuffle of staff and by the time i was leaving in year 11 almost 50 % of the staff had changed because all the old teachers left and were replaced by new teachers . . who were awful . 
  i must have gone to a very shit high school then . 
  nah , credit where credit is due , that was a fairly convincing norfolk accent . 
  i 'll give her a 7/10 for not making us sound like people from the west country . 
  excluding the uk since it 's where i live ... france , spain , italy , germany , belgium , the netherlands , denmark , norway , sweden , finland , czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , austria . 
  that 's 15 . 
  bumps up to 17 if you include the uk and also gibraltar since i 've been there too .
