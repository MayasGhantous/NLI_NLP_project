  the first picture , that looks like a massive bomb !, 
  yeah , its meant as a way to ensure that scotland is able to actually continuing to provide the opportunity for people , i get why people think the scottish education budget ought to pay for people to come , get their degree and leave when the same would not be reciprocated but obviously such selfish motivations can not dictate policy . 
  no it 's based on residency though obviously you have some biases to work out there , for one thing the policy came in under labour though i expect such misinformation from people who are fed bile about scots who do n't support our continued membership of the uk . 
  edit , reworded your question to ask if it was a labout policy , for anyone reading , before it claimed that this was what s/he expected from the snp . 
  [ saas funding guidelines ] ( http://www.saas.gov.uk/_forms/funding_guide.pdf ) you need to be ordinarily resident in scotland , basically if you 're living in scotland just to get free tuition then you do n't qualify , this is the same for scottish students who move away then come back but plenty of english people do get free funding . 
  why are the financially ruinous results of self interested states sacrificing each other in the hope of saving themselves a reason * against * federalism exactly ? 
  they already can .

   iirc , however , mandatory minimums were struck down recently by the ecj it was left up to the national courts to decide whether it could go ahead . 
  the minimum unit pricing was primarily aimed at combating the problem the country has with alcohol , health effects are discussed but it 's more in the sense of it 's bad that these people are suffering these consequences and we should combat that rather than it could save us a couple of quid . 
  they 're not discussing a referendum ... 
  i never said they were . 
  has there been much talk in ireland about the potential effects of companies relocating their hq 's there in the event of a brexit ? 
  hey , if that 's when the people want it then that 's when the people want it . 
  we have elections every 5 years and that hands way more power over than an independence referendum, 
  well it 's already been more than a year since , and that `` whenever '' is clearly in the longer rather than shorter term . 
  thing is , they 've been very respectful of the result , in all likelihood there 'll be no commitment to a referendum in their manifesto ( only a couple months till we find out ) for the first time ever and all indications point to them not including one again until polling shows a clear majority are in favour for a sustained time . 
  the way they are presented outwith scotland 99 % of the time and within scotland half the time would leave people believing the opposite . 
  ah so you mean wanting another one at somepoint rather than within a year of the first . 
  when ? 
  no ... roots . 
  pounds st ** e ** rling the city st ** i ** rling the names have entirely different roots . 
  northern ireland economically speaking is one of the worse parts of the uk , but that eu wide it 's actually not that bad , most of the uk itself is driven upward in ratings by the london effect . 
  it 's bad but it 's not the endless money pit some think of it as . 
  i 'm confused , what are you saying about scotland , that we were conquered and given some land back ? 
  because that 's an incredibly inaccurate reading of history . 
  you 've actually missed the biggest point in favour of what you 're saying . 
  as things stand the uk is a middle man and not a very good one , there 's the national parliament in holyrood and the international one in brussels , as things stand the one in london , * while holding most of the internationally relevant powers * ** feels ** the most irrelevant in the current set-up , basically it comes off as a self-perpetuating anachronism . 
  now , in the early years of a brexit assuming scotland did n't leave immediately there 'd be definite tensions , but as things settled down a bit that relationship would change , it 'd have to , as would the perception of it to one of a union of countries again which was always the scottish position on what the union was and should be , dependant on whether england was willing to make that happen then in the longer term yes , a brexit could strengthen the uk . 
  [ shinty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shinty ) and [ golf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golf ) but golf is shite . 
  grassroots movements form of their own accord , people across communities start to talk , debate and campaign together and over time those individual communities start to come together and form a campaign of their own accord , there ca n't be a launch date in a grassroots campaign , it 's against the very idea of it . 
  an example of a recent one is the yes campaign in scotlands referendum , formed of its own accord , attempted to be adopted by a political party but kept at arms length by the movement . 
  similarly an example of what this is , would be vote no borders , a `` grassroots '' campaign that was bankrolled , had a launch date and had unparalleled advertising on the bbc all day for it . 
  farage might be launching a campaign here and it might get ordinary people involved but in no way is this a grassroots campaign , that 's him adopting a positively viewed term to imbue the campaign with positivity when talked about . 
  tl ; dr grassroots campaigns grow organically , this is not a grassroots campaign . 
  it 's like braveheart in our referendum , there 's the not involved in the process view of events and the involved in them view . 
  looking at spain/sbaen , sbaen actually fits better with how i say it than spain does . 
  it really depends , you can say things like up and down the country across the nation etc and mean the uk or just scotland/england etc , you just reply on context to know which , but i hear those kinds of things far more just referring to scotland than the uk as a whole .

  from now on it 's waleska, 
  estonia was there first and is a cool wee place , if they 're not in , we do n't want in ( do n't want in anyway , just let estonia in ! ), 
  just to try and make the map a bit more uniform , what do england , scotland & wales end in . 
  well i do n't know what funny world you 're living in but thats the reality . 
  i 'm guessing you '' be voting pout come may . 
   but ... any spaniard wan na come in and explain why it peaked in 2013 ? 
  if it 's anything like scotland , you 're far better to ask for an explanation from someone in catalonia specifically , maybe its different there but here only a very simplistic understanding tends to be held outside of scotland of what was and is happening here , in all likelihood its the same there . 
  we 've had them in government for nearly 9 years now , every bit of shit that can be slung has been and will continue to be slung but overall their policies are winning out . 
  i find it more than a little patronising when people who clearly have the most minimal understanding of scottish politics decide they 're the experts . 
  that 's a nonsense , the snp get votes because they are miles ahead of the other parties , vote snp and get competent governance , pretty much the only reason labour in particular even has anyone voting for it anymore is because their dad did and his dad before him . 
  so many people have weighed up the evidence and found the snp the best option for the country so it 's a little strange how many ( who more often than not dislike the snp because of their british nationalism ) decry them on simplistic grounds that anyone can see does n't scratch the surface . 
  [ the real context of the snp 's success ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0idibjr.png ), 
  financial times . 
  the ft , the rest are all pretty shit in that they have their positions and any story will be moulded to suit that or ignored if unable to do so . 
  the telegraph does n't have that much of a reputation left . 
  this is n't a uk sub , could people remember that when they make titles . 
   a minister that lobbies hard for the losing side will be damaged goods afterwards . 
  on the contrary , if they 're smart they 'll make a point of having some of the losing side in high up positions within the party and a healthy mix throughout the campaign to stop the party being defined as being one way inclined or the other thus alienating voters . 
  it 's one of the bigger reasons labour failed so badly in scotland just there ( the reasons are far more complicated than you 'll have read anywhere outside of scotland ) for the entire independence referendum the party was downright hostile to those voting for independence , then less than a year after throwing about all sorts of disparaging sentiments about those voting for independence they expected that support base to stick by them in the general election ... and it did n't . 
  so yeah , if the tories ( and labour for that matter ) are smart , they 'll make a point of treating both arguments as legitimate and showing all views are welcome * especially * afterwards . 
  oh , that old chestnut . 
  they 're in scotland , the french thing is an english thing . 
  actually , the removal of the locking nuts alone would have taken some planning , to get an exact match for farage 's car it 'd have to have been planned and there would be a record of who bought the right size in a certain timeframe and their delivery address . 
  getting the right size key is actually a bit of a ballache . 
  i think that 's exactly what this will turn out to be but for the moment he , at least that article , is quoting him as claiming french police and mechanics suspected foul play . 
  i expect this to go a certain way but i 'd just like to know if maybe he genuinely did laugh off a murder attempt , tell the police to never bother ( and they oblige ) and then keep it quiet for 3 months while his would be assassin is still out there somewhere . 
  can any french people comment on this please , i 'm fairly certain if this happened here and the police had suspicions of attempted murder then it would n't be the would be victims decision anymore whether or not this was pursued , is it different in france ? 
  tbf they were probably right , there 'd always be a reason it should be soon just not right now especially if they were doing good economically as i 'm assuming the intention of a graduated transition was .

  yeah they were tiny , like i said nothing compared to the iss but they were space stations , the idea that people have been to space still amazes me never mind us having stations no matter how small . 
  they were things of their time , also the salyut stations , they may not have been long lived and nowhere near as impressive when you compare it to the iss but they were still space stations . 
  also now we 've got the tiangong getting built, 
  or another cold war , seriously not being alive at the time i had no idea how many space stations existed before the iss . 
  there 's a smoking ban in england that works fine by putting a sign up 99.999999 % of the time . 
  it 's not really a victory it 's in line with expectations , the intention is to have 100 % by 2020 which we 're on course for . 
  generation vs use . 
  scotland exports energy so what they 're doing is saying scotland used x amount and generated y amount ( far more than needed ) and the amount generated by renewables can be said to be equivalent to half of the amount actually used . 
  you 're missing the closest example to home , british , it 's a manufactured identity even today it shows with 60 % identifying with their home nation only , though you would n't know it to look at any uk programming etc. 
  it 's a very middle/upper class thing , i think it shows that no matter how long an identity is foisted on people , if they 're not actively looking themselves to identify with it then they never will , unless the people of the eu want a common european identity then it 'll never happen . 
   did it really take us all the way until the last 30 years to even think about equality it 's honestly only like the last 15-20 the speed at which attitudes have changed ca n't be overstated but if you go back to the turn of the millennium things like section 28 were still in effect and had wide support , the idea that the law caught up to peoples attitudes is very wrong . 
  as in an independence referendum for catalonia but decided by spain as a whole ? 
  that 'd be like scotland 's referendum having england wales and northern ireland having a vote or the uk eu referendum being held in every eu member country . 
  i 'm going to take a shot in the dark on this one and guess that it 's one of those things that there is no realistic prospect of them being able to change it ? 
   the referendum side wo n't recognize that it 's currently illegal to have a local referendum . 
  that sounds like a rather convenient roadblock , it 's a law , laws can be changed even temporarily or for specific circumstances , i do n't have an opinion either way on what catalonia should end up doing but the idea that they ca n't have a referendum on the issue because of a technicality like that is just very obvious willful obstructionism . 
  door mats , seriously that 's the difference does nobody have doormats ? 
  you wipe your shoes so you do n't track in dirt and that 's that , i could n't be bothered with having to take shoes on and off everytime i enter and leave a house . 
  `` show me your papers '' would take a big cultural adjustment to be accepted here . 
  but what i want to know is , who would own the banks if the uk left the eu, 
  we are better together , vote for no borders !, 
  that would prove what i said wrong so i 'm going to ignore it and call you a narrow minded nationalist . 
  leaving the european union can only be done out of feelings of anti-europeaness , there is no other legitimate way to understand this . 
  just like less than a thousand people between shetland , orkney and the western isles combined ( without even geolocking responses so many were not even from the uk never mind scotland ) became shetland and orkney staying with the uk in the event the rest of scotland went independent, 
  bullshit , it 's mostly peddled by people from england who never paid attention yet now think themselves experts on the whole thing . 
   if we ca n't secure some kind of official commitment to a two tier europe then i 'll probably vote to leave . 
  do not give in to hate filled separatist nationalism , the peoples of europe are better together , you are being sold a lie by farage , the uk will not become the utopia he promises . 
   d'awww we love the rest of you cunty bastards !, 
   the difference being , of course , that the rest of the uk took a lot of interest in the scotland referendum except they really really did n't , it was only as it got closer that it became more than a story a month in the news and it was the final week that interest was actually taken but for the most part it was entirely ignroed , it 's a big part of the reason there is such a disjointed view of the whole thing elsewhere in the uk .
