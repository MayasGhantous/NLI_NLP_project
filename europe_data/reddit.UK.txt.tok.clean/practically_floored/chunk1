how is his piano still playing ? 
  haha that paino is amazing, 
  just need cameron to start waving a piece of paper around and talking about `` peace for our time '' , then we know we 're all fucked . 
  you 'd think once the mps knew that someone has that job they would be more careful carrying documents around . 
  is it likely that the forces in crimea will surrender ? 
  it seems that 's their only option unless uk/us/france / germany come out and say they will defend the ukrainian forces , and if the russians did n't back down after that it could be all out war by tomorrow morning . 
  that 's a stupid comment but anyway he 's talking about the ukraine surrendering crimea , not putin surrendering . 
  there are , imo , two main reasons why its important in britain . 
  the first is because it was the first war with conscription , meaning innocent people died , not just people that had volunteered to be soldiers . 
  unfortunately , a lot of these men got sent to war to fight alongside their friends and neighbours , meaning some entire villages were wiped out of all their sons / husbands / fathers etc in a single day . 
  obviously that led these towns / cities to want to permenantly remember the war . 
  second , the date ww1 ended is definite , whereas the date ww2 ended on is n't . 
  this led to armistice day in the uk being held on the closing date of ww1 , despite ww2 being the war people are generally thinking of when commemorating the war dead . 
  this obviously serves to keep ww1 in the collective consciousness of the british people . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://www.punchcartoons.com/ps/store/product/the_awful_warning-49682 ) punch cartoon from 1935 - england and france are saying `` we do n't want you to fight , but , by jingo , if you do , we shall probably issue a joint memorandum suggesting a mild disapproval of you '' . 
  realistically i ca n't see the uk becoming involved in a conflict with russia . 
  the most i can imagine from any western countries against russia is economic and political pressure . 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/106538/ukip-suspends-candidate-over-holocaust-comments ) . 
  they also suspended someone who called a room full of women sluts and then said a journalist was racist for pointing out there were no black people on the ukip brochure . 
  ukip just attracts all the crazies and then every now and then one of them says something ridiculous and gets suspended in a desperate attempt by ukip to appeal to a wider demographic . 
  brown 's public image was ruined during those election , that whole * calling that woman a bigot * thing and then the main thing people remembered about him from the debates was that he said `` i agree with nick '' constantly . 
  i think labour would have done better if he had n't said anything for the whole campaign . 
  nick clegg has been good in debates in the past though , he basically established the lib dems as an actual contender during the last elections after the televised debates . 
  lots of people who voted for them did it because of him . 
  it was n't tolerated , the sharia patrol people got sent to jail, 
  `` miliband was ambushed by conservative mp alok sharma in reading and they debated whether politicians should be looking at floods at all . '', 
  haha, 
  yeah i did n't think she was wearing it for protection , just replying to your comment about it still not stopping headshots under her clothes . 
  true , i 'm just saying her vest points out exactly where is and is n't protected , that 's the problem with wearing it outside her clothes . 
  no but if someone wanted to kill her they know they have to aim for her head , if it was under her jumper they would n't know it was there and might shoot at her body . 
  indentured servants were n't always able to become free though , the people employing them would sometimes refuse to give them the land they had been promised , and so they might have had to work there indefinitely . 
  this basically put them in a similar situation to slaves . 
  obviously not always the case though , i mean slaves in the british and french caribbean were fucked - short life expectancy , no relationships , horrible working conditions , not enough food or clothing - whereas indentured servants working for an honest man could be in a position to buy their own slaves within ten years . 
  this is great , thanks for taking the time to find out the facts . 
  only 4 % difference between uk and italy definitely does n't come across in this map . 
  it says at the top `` answered yes or no to the question '' * do you feel you are a citizen of the eu * '' . 
  `` or '' implies that there were only two choices , meaning the answer would always add to 100 % . 
  it seems like it should all be different shades of blue and the red countries should be representing 40 - 50 % yes , it comes across as a bigger disparity than it is . 
  there is also a gulf politically ( and socially ) between the north and the south of england . 
  you 'd probably feel more at home in the north . 
  that was very interesting thanks . 
  i admit to only having a sketchy knowledge of ww1 , my only point being that pointing out the british were imperialist would not have had an effect on their opinion of other nation 's imperialism , ( in fact it often fostered hate between imperialist nations , for example the seven years war , and the consequential involvement of france in the revolutionary war , meaning the french were fighting against british imperialism while maintaining their own empire overseas ) . 
  so i was basically saying that i doubt british imperialism would have in any way affected a british person 's view on german imperialism . 
  a fear of the potential power of the other country mixed with a dislike of them is usually enough to justify your actions while condemning someone else 's . 
  having said that , i only really study north and south american history so perhaps that assumption is wrong in the cast of the first world war . 
  but again , thanks for the in depth answer , it really was interesting . 
  this is sort of stupid , what are you actually pointing out ? 
  the british were imperialist so they were fine with german imperialism ? 
  or they should have been fine with it ? 
  or maybe in retrospect , we have to pretend british people at the time were n't against german expansion because britain was imperialist ? 
  you may think its hypocritical but that does n't change how people felt . 
  yeah it 's not great , the food stalls are always the best too , i 'd much rather buy something nice to eat than a wind chime . 
  here 's [ liverpool ] ( http://i3.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article6287604.ece/alternates/s1227b/lights18-6287604.jpg ) . 
  that 's literally the only picture i could find of it and it 's out of focus . 
  we also have these [ weird tree things ] ( http://i2.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article6287599.ece/alternates/s2197/lights15-6287599.jpg ) , again not the best picture but the echo apparently likes being arty . 
  well there was [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-25187993 ) about south korea on the news last night , i 'm sure not all schools are like that but it seems they just have a different culture in terms of education , and not one that would really benefit us in many ways other than results-wise . 
  i always love looking at these maps and seeing if the english word comes from scandinavia or france, 
  haha no wonder i did so badly on mine , i obviously just read small bits and guess the rest of the sentence ='), 
  `` aargh '' could have been `` are '' or `` our '' in a posh accent , or maybe `` hour '' in an even posher accent . 
  9/50 for danish . 
  not great really . 
  i did n't know that [ winchester has a christmas market ] ( http://winchester-cathedral.org.uk/christmas/christmas-market/ ) - it looks nice too . 
  i 've always meant to go down there , with it being the former capital of england and everything it seems like an interesting city . 
  that title is complete nonsense , you should have used the one on the article . 
  you 're going to think i 'm really stupid now , but i based that assumption solely on [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/nmwsh9yjlh0?t=34m11s ) . 
  in actuality , you 're right , according to the [ curriculum ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/206145/gcse_geography.pdf ) there is no specified mention of the eu . 
  i think it 's part of georgraphy gcse, 
  while i agree that most european leaders are probably not shocked by this , is n't the issue that you have to be on the country 's soil to claim asylum ? 
  basically the greek police found this blonde child living with roma , discovered that the parents were not related to this child and the child got taken away . 
  the press picked up on this and it became a `` the gypsies have stolen a white blonde child , lets find out who she actually belongs to '' thing . 
  this resulted in some old gypsy stereotypes coming out and a lot of anti-gypsy feeling . 
  then it was discovered that this child * was * roma , she just did n't belong to the roma people she 'd been found with . 
  also , she was n't stolen , just given away . 
  also , there have been a few other cases in ireland and portugal this week where some roma children have been taken away only to find out that they were living with their actual parents.the whole thing does n't make people who bashed gypsies look too good really , since in this case no roma have really done anything wrong . 
  at least you tried !, 
  it 's not liverpool , it looks like the wirral and cheshire . 
  possibly something to do with [ cammell laird ship builders ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cammell_laird#second_rebirth_as_cammell_laird_shiprepair ) reopening in 2007 and winning a number of multi million pound ship building contracts from the government . 
  people also say `` it never rains but it pours '' , at least where i 'm from, 
  i would n't , i have him tagged already since the other day he was wearing a union jack tag and spouting off about how ireland was a part of the uk ( [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nsg5c/irish_government_defeated_as_voters_reject/cclnxjt ) , although he 's deleted his comments ) . 
  i would n't put too much faith in this being a joke , probably he 's just trolling though . 
  this is annoying , i rarely smoke but i do enjoy menthols every now and then . 
  i suppose by 2022 i probably wo n't care . 
  i could n't deal with people being so artificial in america - specifically workers in restaurants and shops acting as if they really cared about my `` shopping experience '' or whatever . 
  not saying it 's wrong , just that that was a major culture shock for me , it felt like everyone was acting . 
  that was hilariously cringey . 
  i was thinking that scotland had passed gay marriage when england and wales did , just remembered they did n't , sorry . 
  what aspects of day to day living would you say are found in scottish and irish culture and not english , then ? 
  i do n't think i would call that brown , definitely maroon to me in that picture . 
  i do n't know about that , on issues like gay rights , religion , abortion rights etc scotland is generally more in line with england . 
  it depends what aspect you 're looking at . 
  i 've always loved [ please please please ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlc5dvypsgc ) by the smiths, 
  i 'll take any chance to make a playlist !, 
  english bands singing in english , boring i know . 
  [ frankie goes to hollywood - relax ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wz33w3b8hw ) [ the human league - do n't you want me baby ?

  i think he meant it would be the opposite of ok, 
  quite a few of my nana 's brothers and sisters moved from ireland to american when she and my grandad moved to england . 
  i 've always thought it 'd be interesting to see how strongly the ones in my generation identified as irish , since it never really occurs to me to consider myself part irish but i suspect it might be different for them . 
  i just signed my mum up for one of these courses , it 's great i hope more topics become available in the future . 
  i 'm not sure whether this is changing or its the difference between the countryside and the city , but for most people i know they aim to go out around 11 - 12pm and back by 4 - 7am .
