  if you go to a club before 11pm where i 'm from it would be completely empty , in fact you can get into most paid clubs for free if you go then . 
  at the moment i love blood red shoes - [ i wish i was someone better ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtt2gm3rpze ) and also [ cold ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-yxwxirq-e ) . 
  also , here 's some [ cribs - come on be a no one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aqwbehxbfi ) and to top it off a traditional sea shanty - fisherman 's friends - [ bound for south australia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34s7vkmi24 ), 
  amsterdam is lovely , i would go there, 
  i forgot how big his forehead looked in those posters . 
  also , this reminded me of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekfttyx2ohc ) video that came out during the elections . 
  the muslim community in the uk only makes up around 5 % , so i doubt it has a huge affect on those figures . 
  also , i know muslims that do drink , so not all of that 5 % wo n't drink . 
  it 's funny , i 've seen people claim that the bbc is right leaning here before , but in the uk it is [ often ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2389589/bbc-twice-likely-cover-left-wing-news-stories-right-wing-ones.html ) [ criticised ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9934902/have-you-heard-the-one-about-bbc-radio-4-and-the-left-wing-bias.html ) for being too left leaning . 
  there 's been hardly any royal baby hype , there was a lot of excitement over the jubilee though , mainly because we got a day off and there were loads of people celebrating themselves . 
  it 's sort of how people celebrate bonfire night without having a huge hatred towards guy fawkes , but instead just because it 's fun to celebrate . 
  i think it was because of the r/funny post rather than the r/murica one , if its cross posted just because of r/murica that 's even more stupid . 
  but yeah , i 'm glad to see a battle did n't break out too . 
  edit : yeah it is because of the r/murica post - i missed that in the title . 
  so yeah , its stupid . 
  one person cross posted it , and it 's currently sitting at -5 . 
  i would n't say we 're all eager to get back at them . 
  i think plspirit was being sarcastic, 
  if they expressed their opinion surely we are allowed to express ours ? 
  not that i think we should do anything , but it seems a bit weird to say `` this person thinks you are ` some of the worst people ' , instead of replying just sit and think about why that is '' . 
  also , no one in europe thinks people want to bow down and worship us , and if you think europeans think like that i do n't know why you would frequent a subreddit dedicated to europe , seems like it would just annoy you . 
  because historically they mean a lot and they really show the mood of the country at that time, 
  i agree , to me ( despite the alternative version ) i think it has more grandeur than their current one . 
  when i was in brownies ( youth group for girls in case you do n't know ) we used to sing battle hymn of the republic but with different lyrics - it went something like `` he jumped without a parahute from 40 thousand feet ( x3 ) and he aint gon na jump no more , glory glory what a heck of a way to die , when youre wearing frilly knickers and you do n't know how to fly , glory glory what a heck of a way to die , and he aint gon na jump no more '' . 
  i completely forgot about that until i listened to your link just now !, 
  honestly i have to say [ france ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy8tdnqdpwi ) . 
  its such a great anthem , very rousing and great lyrics . 
  or [ nighty night ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uttc8qunv4e ), 
  yeah so do i , i hope we use it more in the future . 
  that 's true , it is used in some sporting events involving england . 
  in the commonwealth games and cricket jerusalem is used though , and it is becoming more popular , there was a call for jerusalem to be used in the 2014 world cup , but i 'm not sure if that will happen or not . 
  it 's more that god save the queen is used for british events , not for english ones specifically . 
  for example the olympics used gstq but the ashes opened with jerusalem the other day . 
  it does n't take into account variations of any name . 
  what source are you using ? 
  i was just reading [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23663337 ) which was only published three days ago . 
  the second most common boy 's name in england and wales is actually oliver . 
  muhammad is not in the top ten unless you only survey london . 
  yes but old norse must have `` moved into the country '' since there are many place names in old norse in the west of the country , that 's what i was addressing . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's true , i live on the west coast of england where we still use old norse names for many of the towns . 
  because gibraltar and spain are both in europe ? 
  it has actually been reported here , here it is on the front of the independent : http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/indy_snowdenredraft ( 1 ) . jpg an `` exclusive '' in the guardian : http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/51b4e6326bb3f73b28000042-960/4fgb%20 ( 1 ) . jpg and if you look at the [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/search/news/?q=snowden&amp;video=on&amp;audio=on&amp;text=on ) , you can see there are a lot of stories about him . 
  what do you mean ? 
  three baguettes a day seems like an awful lot of bread, 
  faster than me !, 
  my fastest * ever * is 100 % in 1:09, 
  he did n't say it was n't , he said murdoch would be able to control the uk government better without the intrusion of the eu parliament , like he can in america . 
  i think it stands for `` greece '' in greek - it 's '' \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 '' which apparently literally translated is `` ell\u012bnik\u012b\u0301 '' . 
  our coat of arms and some of our army units * also * have french mottos , * actually . 
  * ^ ^ ^ wait , ^ ^ ^ what ^ ^ ^ side ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ on ? 
  it was n't just the uk that blocked it though . 
  also , how does this benefit the us ? 
  they still have to answer to charges about data privacy and prism , but now the national security and intelligence of countries within the eu will not be discussed . 
  to me it seems like the uk government have tried to avoid having to answer allegations themselves and restricted the topics solely to those that are aimed towards the us . 
  that does n't sound like something that the us would be pushing the uk to organise . 
  just did a quick google search for the title to try and find a copy of the article , and came across a different version of the original that had also been taken down - [ here ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/2013/jun/30/taken-down ) . 
  `` this article has been taken down pending an investigation . '', 
  - either it 's not true , or it is and someone does n't want it to be reported . 
  anyway , i found what looks to be a full version of it [ here ] ( http://www.newssniffer.co.uk/articles/658994/diff/0/1 ) . 
  edit : originally ops link redirected me to the homepage of the guardian website , now it 's the same as the first link in my comment , probably just looked at them at different times . 
  i dont really understand how those videos prove that point, 
  i understand that it must be annoying to spain for gibraltar to be british land , but it 's not like they are n't guilty of exactly the same thing with [ ceuta and melilla ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14114627 ) in morocco . 
  well [ * scouse * ] ( http://www.channel4.com/4food/recipes/tv-show-recipes/sunday-brunch-recipes/proper-scouse-recipe ) is from my home region , it 's nice but probably not my favourite food . 
  i would probably pick [ devilled kidneys ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/devilled_kidneys_58867 ) as one of my favourite british foods . 
  because the question is about all europeans being lumped in together as if europe were a single country , taenk said it 's the same as saying `` americans '' and my point was that `` americans '' refers to people of a single country , so it 's normal to lump them all in together . 
  `` european '' spans a whole continent , so it 's not the equivalent of `` american '' . 
  but america is a shortened form of `` united states of america '' and used to mean one county 's people . 
  `` europeans '' does n't refer to people from a single country . 
  surely obeying would be promising to extradite him if he tries to enter the uk , not telling him not to enter it ? 
  i did n't realise that , from what you say it seems like it was a reflection of panic in the market rather than a bubble , i have to say i do n't know too much about it though . 
  but what about that massive burst a few months ago where the bitcoin fell from around 200 usd to 50 usd overnight ? 
  that definitely seemed like a bubble . 
  they were pakistani but so were almost everyone else on the plane , since it was coming from pakistan . 
  i think maybe it 's not terror related and so has purposefully been downplayed so as not to create any more anti-muslim feeling after what 's happened this week . 
  a gif needs to be made out of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=hfjhjnevone#t=13s ) dance move, 
  he said it was better than last year , when we got 25th !, 
  it 's a date !, 
  well , that was fun . 
  19th , not too bad !, 
  much better than i expected anyway, 
  i do n't know what went wrong !, 
  oh god what is that little badge, 
  oh yes five points , i knew we could count on malta !, 
  there 's only two in it , we 're catching up !, 
  although probably not ... 
  i ca n't believe france is so low , i thought that act was good, 
  what did you really expect ? 
  european countries come together and sing , then vote for who did it best . 
  winner hosts next year . 
  whoo scott mills !, 
  that person looks like an anime, 
  yes come on greece !, 
  i ca n't decide if this is amazing or cringey, 
  i assume every country is just showing filler , the uk is a profile of bonny since she 's been in sweden, 
  i want malta or greece to win - or romania , just for the hell of it, 
  oh i forgot about finland !, 
  what made me laugh in that song is that she says `` walk the walk of shame '' which i assume means walk down the aisle , but where i 'm from `` the walk of shame '' is when you go back to a guy 's house after a night out and have to walk back to your house in going out clothes the next day . 
  he looks so awkward, 
  ahahaha what is this ? 
  greece needs to win with this !,
