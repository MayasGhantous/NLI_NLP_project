  i already love greece 's entry, 
  it looks like they 're both in love with the guy in the box, 
  holding out for a zero till the end of the night !, 
  haha yeah i do that all the time - `` hey do n't be mean about brit - oh your british , that 's ok then '' . 
  this song is n't too bad, 
  the words to this song ( or at least the english translation ) are really weird, 
  we keep on sending such terrible acts that young acts do n't want to be associated with being the uk 's entry for the eurovision now . 
  she looks out of it, 
  brace yourself : this will be bad, 
  clear winner here, 
  this is amazing, 
  `` very eurovision '' - i 'm looking forward to this one now !, 
  this song is quite boring - its still a little catchy though, 
  i would love that !, 
  did n't they bake a pie while singing or something ridiculous like that ? 
  wow this is quite similar to [ last years winner ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4pmqb5zmau ), 
  i really like malta 's entry !, 
  oh is this the one with the gay kiss ? 
  edite : haha yep , graham norton just said `` at the end this has two girls kissing , and if two girls kissing offends you , you should grow up '', 
  what was that about his shoes ? 
  to be honest i never even considered that europe would be any worse off if we left , all i ever thought was that we would probably be much worse off while europe likely prospered . 
  to be honest that 's what most people think , the maintenance loan especially is seen by a lot of people as bonus spending money for while you 're at uni . 
  i know it 's not a ridiculous amount of money , but it 's just in my experience even people from fairly rich families get loans and support themselves in university . 
  i have to say though , that is just my experience so it could well be different for other people . 
  we get student loans from the government that are interest free and do n't have to be paid back until we are earning a certain amount , and even then it 's at a low level and get 's written off around age 45 or something like that . 
  i have two student loans , one that pays my uni fees and one that 's for expenses , and that 's the same for all my friends . 
  the only people i 've ever heard not get a student loan are very rich people who are funded by their parents . 
  the majority of the rest of the uk would also vote to stay in the eu , therefore also rejecting the eu referendum , according to those figures . 
  if you look at the actual figures scotland also comes ahead of london on issues like `` if we renegotiated our position would you still vote for britain to leave the european union '' .

  denmark apparently . 
  i 'm happy with that . 
  well they had just invaded poland , arguably the ultimatum gave them a choice ( withdraw or go to war ) but even if you argue that germany was never given that ultimatum or something like that surely the appeasement before the war indicates some sort of effort to avoid war on the part of the allies ? 
  i do n't really understand how germany could be said to play no part in starting the war , any sources you have would be interesting to read . 
  yeah that 's about the conclusion i came to myself , thanks for giving me another perspective , it 's interesting !, 
  [ chamberlain declared war on germany , not churchill ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe-7wljw_50 ), 
  i 've often wondered about this , people outside the uk seem to use or at least understand the term `` the victorians '' but then i thought well since these time periods are based on kings and queens actually it 's probably not used outside the uk . 
  now you cleared it up for me before i even got round to asking anyone about it !, 
  philip oltermann ( the author of this article ) is actually a german living in the uk , and it was the german president joachim gauck that suggested the language of the eu should be english , so the `` respecting the uk : what the fuck do they think they are ???? '', 
  bit is a little unwarranted , unless it 's for another reason . 
  i agree though , i do n't think the language of the eu should be english , diversity within the eu should be valued , and for me that includes language . 
  imagine if out of nowhere they just said that all eu business had to be conducted in latin , that would be amazing . 
  i would say that actually europeans tend to compare events that take place in america to europe , and conversely americans often compare evens that happen in europe to america . 
  most of the time it 's rare to see a european randomly compare an event that happens in their own country to america for no particular reason , and the same the other way around . 
  you 're implying that it does by saying that the people in this thread criticising america are creating a `` one way rivalry '' . 
  my pet peeve - when people imply that the `` great '' in `` great britain '' is supposed to mean `` amazing '' . 
  it 's funny that you say that , as in the uk the bbc often gets accused of having a pro-europe and eu bias when its supposed to be neutral . 
  the issue i was trying to bring up is that claiming that a person ca n't criticise something because of something that happens in their own country is a stupid principle and one that is incredibly counter-productive to discussion . 
  the flairs are n't there to enable people to criticise each other 's countries . 
  so because less than 1 % of people in the uk had to use provisions from a food bank last year people from the uk now can not criticise any government for their actions when it comes to the hunger of their population ? 
  since english is your native language , you might want to try some cities in the uk , up north is generally thought of as more friendly if you do think about going , but obviously london is where people generally want to see . 
  that being said , one of my favourite cities in europe is amsterdam and i would recommend travelling there . 
  i always find it so friendly and welcoming , i went last year and i ca n't wait to go back !, 
  i studied spanish and french in school and i 'm currently continuing learning french in my spare time , not for any particular reason other than i want to be able to speak another language and i 'm best at french . 
  i 'm also learning russian , because its a fucking amazing language and i love it , once you get past the alphabet it 's not too difficult but i 'm really just a beginner . 
  obviously not , but he 's going to go for the easy support from the jesuits , and everyone else it seems , because he 's used to living like that so it 's not difficult for him and is what is expected of him by some people . 
  people keep on being surprised by him doing things like this , but he 's a jesuit and jesuits take a vow of poverty , so really if he did live in luxury it would go against his vows . 
  also that james hewitt ( who had an affair with diana ) [ is harry 's father . 
  great hangover cure too . 
  just what you need after an english night out . 
  looking back on it now , david miliband probably would have been more pr friendly, 
  are you saying 55 % of people in scotland are not `` ethnic scots '' ? 
  he said he 'd resign if he did n't win his seat ( thanet south . ), 
  i hope it 's andy burnham, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.intelligentlifemagazine.com/sites/default/files/1115il_pl_car_01-web.jpg ) is slightly higher quality . 
  it depends how you think of it . 
  if you sat down to focus on every minute of play it would be ridiculous to watch , but 5 day tests can be great if you just have them on in the background . 
  the ashes especially reminds me of the summer , you can just sit around all day drinking beer and watching the cricket , and the commentators are always relaxed and just talking about random things other than the match for a lot of the time . 
  then it can get really exciting towards the end . 
  when your legs stop the ball from hitting the wicket, 
  [ in cricket the game is so slow they sometimes get the players to commentate while they 're playing .

  yeah from what i 've seen of baseball they 're very similar , except iirc you only hold the rounders bat in one hand and it 's smaller . 
  it 's basically whatever is easiest to say . 
  `` an european '' is more awkward than `` a european '' because of the ` y ' sound at the beginning of the word . 
  cricket is easy , you just hit the ball and run back and forth . 
  they count it by golds , then if theres a tie for golds it goes by silvers , then bronzes . 
  he definitely meant in the opinion of the tabloids , that 's why he said `` it is scandalous enough *** for them *** that they get access to fifa . '', 
  - them being the tabloid newspapers . 
  i agree with your points . 
  he means in the eyes of the tabloids . 
  because according to them prisoners should be being punished and playing fifa seems like too much fun . 
  i decided to learn some norwegian a few years ago and that was when i realised that a lot of the place names round where i live translate directly into norwegian/danish/swedish and were founded by danes . 
  that made me a little more interested in what was there before . 
  i think the most recent one was in october 2015 when a policeman got run over by a car that was being chased by police . 
  i found out today that apparently the phrase `` made up '' as in happy is only used in merseyside, 
  well there 's the bbc world service but yeah i guess it could be more localised . 
  i think there would probably be a funding issue with that tbh . 
   i feel this is the fault of the uk for being fine with an almost complete american monopoly on english-language ( pop ) culture . 
  this is n't really true , we have lots of films , music and tv shows . 
  when i went to watch everton at old trafford i noticed some of the stands outside the stadium were accepting euros , i guess because they know people fly in to watch united and do n't have change on them . 
  i went to tunisia when i was about 6 , and at the time was a pale blonde little girl . 
  i just remember people kept on giving me free stuff ( mainly oranges ) and complementing me on my skin and hair . 
  well in the uk if you were trying to buy something in a shop it would go something like `` hi , i 'll just have this please '' '' * that 'll be # 5 * '' `` great thanks , bye '' '' * bye * '' whereas in america it 's more like `` hi '' '' * hello , there , how is your day today ? 
  * '' `` alright thanks , just this please '' '' * that 's great , that 'll be $ 5 . 
  are you having a nice day out today ? 
  * '' `` yeah it 's alright '' '' * well i hope the rest of your day is great * '' it just feels like it devalues any conversations that you actually do have . 
  like if in england you start talking to someone in the service industry about something , you know they 're actually interested in having a conversation . 
  in america you do n't know if they 're interested or just doing it because they 're supposed to .
