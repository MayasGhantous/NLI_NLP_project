wrong . 
  but i forgot , this is r/europe , where the chance to make a snide comment is more important than factual accuracy . 
  edit : cameron just announced in parliament up to 20,000 refugees from the camps bordering syria . 
  scroll down to the [ data summary ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-spending-contributions-european-union ) here . 
  7 billion from germany , close to 5 billion each from france , italy and the uk . 
  you said nothing about efficient spending , you said we did n't spend the money . 
  there is such a thing as living standards . 
  the gdp per capita of macedonia is $ 4,000 , for the uk it 's $ 45,000 . 
  a refugee in the uk will get things that one in macedonia certainly will not , making it more expensive to take care of them . 
  you remind me of a guy on r/scotland who said we should build camps in the highlands for them to go to , what would be the point in that ? 
  why would they bother moving from the camps they are already in ? 
  if we take them in we need to be able to offer them all the things we offer the native population . 
  i thought the eu spent $ 214 billion a year on defence , more than anywhere except the usa , but i suppose i was wrong . 
  seriously ? 
  there is no shortage of cheap unskilled labour in this world , you really think the western countries are paying billions to the east and including them in a union because they ca n't find workers anywhere else ? 
  grow a pair . 
  everyone is getting called stuff . 
  think we have n't heard all the stuff in your post a million times in the past week ? 
  colonialism and western interference ( the latter of which actually often includes ee countries ) gets brought up in every thread , whether relevant or not . 
  you notice the stuff about ee that i do n't , i notice the stuff aimed at the uk that you probably do n't take it . 
  everyone 's getting insulted and being subjected to half arsed/ill thought out opinions and criticisms , you 're only paying attention to the ones that relate to you . 
  it 's september . 
  ha , i 've seen a few people make that mistake . 
  i guess people do n't want to let go of summer . 
  here in scotland we 're still waiting for it to arrive . . 
   actually there is plenty of reasons for the uk to take more refugees in , are you for real ? 
  did you even read my post properly ? 
  i said we should take refugees , we should take the vulnerable ones who are in camps on the outskirts of a warzone . 
  not the ones who are in hungary after passing several safe countries and are dead set on germany . 
  i said we should be taking in refugees who will be the most vulnerable and weak , those incapable of travelling over sea from one continent to another . 
  why do you think the [ majority ] ( http://www.politicoscope.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hungary-headline-news-now-refugees-in-trains-heading-for-austria-germany-suspended-650x435.jpg ) are men ? 
  where do you think the women and children are ? 
  where are the disable ? 
  the ones who make it here are the most physically able . 
  i personally do n't want to leave everyone else to rot . 
  you just ignored all that and started going on about foreign policy . 
  no thanks . 
  there is no reason for us to take migrants who are already safe in europe . 
  firstly it encourages more to come ( risking their lives ) , and secondly we ca n't even be sure who is actually from syria . 
  cameron has said that the refugees the uk will take on will be from the camps on the syrian border , this is absolutely the correct approach . 
  i 'd welcome a high number of refugees from those camps . 
  anyway i do n't want to get into a big argument with you , as i think i 've done it before with you being very snappy and sarky , i just found your comment funny since we ca n't * make * more people apply for asylum here . 
  fair enough , but i 'd say in the case of iraq that 's a responsibility taken on with the decision to invade . 
  if we blow things up we owe it to the people to rebuild it . 
   that 's quite a pathetically low number are you suggesting we force people to apply for asylum here ? 
  what should we do to fix this `` pathetic number '' , erect billboards in damascus ? 
   the us is also 3x-4x farther away from syria than any european nation , so it stands to reason that we should n't be as invested i do n't buy that at all . 
  distance does n't seem to be a problem for your military , since they are dropping bombs inside syria right now , but it 's too far for aid money to go to ? 
  i think the us probably has given enough for the syrian crisis if that above figure is correct , no argument there , and i 'm not anti everything usa like some you 'll find so not looking for a fight , but your argument for low foreign aid i do n't agree with . 
  you guys spend 3.3 % of gdp on the military , but just 0.19 % on foreign aid . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/apr/06/aid-oecd-given ) is an article about aid given in 2010 that shows the uk as the highest then too . 
  you 're right , i posted that while looking at the map in op 's article which for some reason has the french absent . 
  still though , those countries give a combined total of 24 billion , the uk gives almost 18 billion , so it 's still a lot . 
  [ spanish empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_empire ) [ dutch empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_empire ) [ french empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_colonial_empire ) [ portuguese empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_empire ) [ italian empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_empire ) [ belgian colonies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgian_colonial_empire ), 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_governments_by_development_aid#official_development_assistance_by_country_as_a_percentage_of_gross_national_income_in_2013 ) is the list based on percentage of gni . 
  you said the amount of our foreign aid was mainly due to population size , i pointed out to you that there are wealthy countries of far larger populations spending less than us , disproving your point . 
  and i pointed out that there is a country of very close population to us spending a fifth of what we do , more evidence to disprove your point . 
  clearly population is not * the * important factor . 
   please realise that it is mainly a factor of your population size . 
  mainly down to population size ? 
  the uk spends five times more than italy , a country of similar population , and a few billion more than germany , a country of fairly larger population . 
  also there 's japan that has almost double our population but gives billions less . 
  there is no law that says x population requires x amount of foreign aid , this money and the amount is given voluntarily . 
  the spanish , dutch , french , portuguese , italians etc did the same thing , even the belgians got in on it . 
  yet britain is still giving more than those other countries combined . 
  god forbid a brit be proud of his country doing something good , he must immediately be put back in his place and reminded of history . 
  it 's estimated that there were ~ 60,000 taliban fighters in afghanistan . 
   isis was created by the war in iraq . 
  who led that ? 
  led ? 
  the us . 
  not that isis had anything to do with starting wars in those countries you mentioned either . 
  i 'm done with this pointless conversation . 
  translator was n't working great so i found an [ english ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/eu-migrant-crisis-2015-germany-could-spend-billions-refugee-care-integration-labor-2077105 ) article on the subject . 
  firstly you exaggerated the amount a great deal , secondly that 's money expected to be spent in the future on caring for refugees taken in . 
  so really this does n't have anything to do with my comment which was about aid given , and was instead yet another chance to boast about taking refugees ? 
  i do n't know where you get the idea that germany has given almost # 5 billion , but that 's patently false . 
  [ scroll down to the interactive map ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10570726/syria-crisis-how-does-britains-aid-donation-compare.html ) . 
  bit out of date now , as it only goes up to jan 2015 , but i 'd be surprised if germany had gone from # 200 million to # 4.8 billion in that time . 
  the uk has been the third , or at times second , largest donor for a couple of years . 
  or you could try explaining yourself instead of leaving one sentence comments and having me do all the work , first trying to work out what you 're talking about and then having to show you why it 's bullshit ( since you 're clearly incapable of researching anything yourself ) . 
  libya - civilians protest and are cracked down on violently , armed conflict ensues and soon turns into a fully fledged civil war . 
  nato coalition ( 16 countries ) as well as 4 other countries intervene militarily . 
  eritrea - there is no war in eritrea . 
  syria - protests , violent crackdown , armed rebellion and now civil war . 
  the uk rejected a motion in parliament to intervene with air strikes . 
  so by root causes of three wars you meant that the uk intervened in one of those countries into an already ongoing war along with 19 others ? 
  libya - italian colony . 
  eritrea - italian colony . 
  syria - french colony . 
   and those countries as well should be apart of looking after the refugees from those countries . 
  right , so why the talk of `` send them all here . '', 
  that 's what started the whole argument . 
   and due to that should be helping to look after refugees from iraq . 
  fair enough , but comparatively [ few ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-six-charts-that-show-where-refugees-are-coming-from-where-they-are-going-and-how-they-are-getting-to-europe-10482415.html ) are actually coming from iraq . 
   you simply ca n't ignore the fact that a large result of what 's happening in syria now is partially down to what happened in iraq as well . 
  first you need to prove that actually is a fact . 
  do you mean isis ? 
  because the only reason they were able to expand into syria was because there had been a civil war going on for two years already . 
  or do you mean the overthrowing of hussein inspired others ?
