   ukraine makes me happy . 
  they are standing up for injustice . 
  i know you did n't mean to type that but it 's far truer than most things said on this subreddit, 
  sure , although it should be self-evident from the total lack of socialist participation . 
  but anyway http://www.thenation.com/article/178013/ukrainian-nationalism-heart-euromaidan but rhetoric can quickly escalate into action , and already protestors with apparent nationalist sentiments have taken part in a spate of attacks on left-wing activists on independence square . 
  on november 27 , activists with signs reading `` freedom , equality , sisterhood , '' `` europe is sex education , '' `` europe is equality '' and `` organize trade union instead of praying for europe '' said they were assaulted by `` far-right thugs '' calling themselves `` organizers of the protest , '' who tore the banners . 
  on november 28 , several men with covered faces pepper-sprayed a group of feminists and tore a banner reading `` europe means paternity leaves . '' on december 4 , labor organizer denis levin and his two brothers were beaten by a small crowd shouting `` glory to ukraine '' and `` death to enemies '' after a nationalist writer on the stage pointed them out as `` provocateurs '' with red flags , levin told the nation . 
  shortly before and after the attack , miroshnychenko , a member of svoboda 's political council , came by the tent where the brothers were agitating for the confederation of free labor unions , levin added . 
  the nose of one brother was broken , and denis suffered from the irritative gas used against the trio . 
  where are all the flags from non-fascists exactly ? 
  where are the denunciations of fascist involvement ? 
  attempts to marginalise the extreme anti-semites and neo-nazis there ? 
  there is none of this , the only people who have been chased away from the protest have been liberals and trade unionists . 
  no those are the goals of the movement which have been ascribed to it by the western media , brussels and the white house . 
  in reality svoboda wants the removal of what it considered to be the ` jewish-muscovite mafia ' http://www.channel4.com/news/kiev-svoboda-far-right-protests-right-sector-riot-police, 
  they are n't all fascists , just most , and those who are n't fascists are tolerant of fascists and willing to work within a mostly fascist violent protest . 
  yeah because non-fascists regularly go on protests with huge numbers of fascist flags . 
  ... and here 's a totally not fascist funeral for a protester http://imgur.com/a/lsvok, 
  kleptocrats vs fascists is n't much of a choice, 
  it is n't pro-yanukovych , i do n't think anyone in the west is actually pro-russian kleptocracy it 's just that those who understand the situation recognise that the likes of svoboda and right sector represent something much worse . 
  yes , it is depressing that so many people are unwilling to see the obvious fucking reality right in front of their faces - most pictures of the protest involve some far-right flags or symbols . 
  the eu is stirring up neo-nazis to fight on its behalf in ukraine , a very dangerous game http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/29/ukraine-fascists-oligarchs-eu-nato-expansion, 
  funny how much you 're being downvoted , the eu federalist hivemind is strong here, 
  eu is rewarding its fascist shocktroops in ukraine while preparing to send in its own shocktroops in bosnia against a genuine people 's uprising . 
  stormfront is leaking again, 
  obvious jobbik apologist for anti-semitism is very fucking obvious . 
  you mean monopolise criminality , right ? 
  eu neoliberalism showing why it is no alternative to british neoliberalism . 
  if you want to see the vision of the future of ukraine from the ukrainian opposition then look at the history of nazi germany . 
  you wo n't accept glorifying jew killing collaborators with the nazis , you wo n't accept anti-semitic statements , you wo n't accept white power flags , you wo n't accept the fact that the group very recently gave up neo-nazi heraldry . 
  there is no evidence that will convince svoboda 's # 1 fan in the uk . 
  open minded about neo-nazis ? 
  http://hnn.us/article/122778 historian karel berkhoff , among others , has shown that bandera , his deputies , and the nazis shared a key obsession , namely the notion that the jews in ukraine were behind communism and stalinist imperialism and must be destroyed . 
  `` the jews of the soviet union , '' read a banderist statement , `` are the most loyal supporters of the bolshevik regime and the vanguard of muscovite imperialism in the ukraine . '' when the germans invaded the ussr in june 1941 and captured the east galician capital of lvov , bandera 's lieutenants issued a declaration of independence in his name . 
  they further promised to work closely with hitler , then helped to launch a pogrom that killed four thousand lvov jews in a few days , using weapons ranging from guns to metal poles . 
  `` we will lay your heads at hitler 's feet , '' a banderist pamphlet proclaimed to ukrainian jews . 
  also , do n't take my word for it ... http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/item/ukraine_strips_nationalist_leader_bandera_of_honor_20110112 former president viktor yuschenko last year granted the prestigious award to bandera , the leader of the organization of ukrainian nationalists , shortly before national elections , which he lost . 
  the award recognizes either heroism or achievement in labor . 
  the ukrainian nationalist forces led by bandera fought against the nazis and the soviet army in world war ii , and led an armed battle against soviet rule in ukraine into the 1950s . 
  bandera was assassinated by a kgb agent in munich in 1959 . 
  he is held in high esteem by ukrainians . 
  jewish groups in ukraine and abroad decried granting the award to bandera , calling him a nazi collaborator . 
  elan steinberg , vice president of the american gathering of holocaust survivors and their descendants , praised the announcement that ukraine has stripped bandera of the title . 
  advertisement `` by annulling bandera 's decoration , ukraine has removed a disgraceful blot on the country 's moral standing in the world , '' steinberg said in a statement released wednesday . 
  `` as an ally of the nazis , bandera was complicit in the murder of thousands of jews and the destruction of their towns and villages, 
  mussolini 's fascist party had a few jewish members . 
  did n't stop bandera murdering tens of thousands of jews and it did n't stop mussolini doing the same . 
  ... all over the subreddit, 
  you are being downvoted by non-ukrainian neo-nazis , their sympathisers and useful idiots taken in by bullshit . 
  thanks for giving a balanced and truthful account on here though . 
  most british people do n't know what svoboda is but if you told them what they believe then they would be horrified . 
  specofdust is just special and i suspect a frequenter of stormfront . 
  you round up and kill jews during the holocaust or you do n't and he did . 
  the fact that you try to justify that with the fact that anti-semitism was popular at the time and the idea of jews were all marxists ... well no shit . 
  let 's absolve hitler on that basis too . 
  i assume that we 're going to see a defence of the vichy government from you as well . 
  god knows how right-wing you are if you think a ` formerly ' neo-nazi political party which continues to [ hold candle lit vigils ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25571805 ) for a man who helped the nazis to [ round up jews ] ( http://hnn.us/article/122778 ) is a ` right of centre ' party . 
  do n't take my word for it , seeing as this is an extremely europhile subreddit let 's look at the eu 's view , `` parliament goes on to express concern about the rising nationalistic sentiment in ukraine , expressed in support for the svoboda party , which , as a result , is one of the two new parties to enter the verkhovna rada . 
  it recalls that racist , anti-semitic and xenophobic views go against the eu 's fundamental values and principles and therefore appeals to pro-democratic parties in the verkhovna rada not to associate with , endorse or form coalitions with this party . '', 
  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/summary.do?id=1239823&amp;t=e&amp;l=en why the apologism btw ? 
  are you a bnp supporter too ? 
  i wonder if the building will be filled with nazi and white power flags like we saw before in the town hall http://i.imgur.com/zagrzdl.jpg http://i.imgur.com/juwnlv0.jpg, 
  just like nazi germany , no problems there with racial ideology ... oh wait . 
  ironically you are right since the british empire was based on white supremacy which is what a good number of the protesters want to establish in ukraine . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20824693 even now , svoboda 's platform calls for passports to specify the holder 's ethnicity , and for government positions to be distributed proportionally to ethnic groups , based on their representation in the population at large . 
  `` we want ukrainians to run the country , '' says bohdan , a participant in a recent svoboda rally , as he waves a ukrainian flag and organises cheering and chanting . 
  `` seventy percent of the parliament are jews . '', 
  some see signs that svoboda 's radical elements are reasserting themselves . 
  activists recently attacked and sprayed tear gas at a gay rights rally in central kiev . 
  ihor miroshnychenko , meanwhile , used abusive language to describe the ukrainian-born american actress mila kunis , who is jewish , in an online discussion . 
  in this picture svoboda members honour ukrainian collaborators with the nazis who were responsible for facilitating the mass murder of jews during the nazi occupation of the country https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcqpfwb9klglbvikzuwaowcxuuvqcahy8grrju3md00p55etzx4tmw here we have protest members with a 14/88 sign http://www.channel4.com/media/images/channel4/c4-news/2014/january/24/24_svobod2_r_w_lrg.jpg 14 stands for 14 words , a neo-nazi slogan and 88 stands for heil hitler . 
  no , it 's a fascist symbol because it is the flag of an openly fascist group . 
  are you going to bang on about the ` judeo-moscovite ' mafia next like the rest of the opposition ? 
  the two pictures you need to understand ukraine 's crisis http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gctihralrukonkc4vl3mt0uobq8l_rtw-jlah7ypizlakxzx0aia https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcr7ciofm6yvakpmc3w8awqflvhpls_lteimvjhn1wqhwstm_klegw, 
  fascists act like fascists shocker http://www.channel4.com/news/kiev-svoboda-far-right-protests-right-sector-riot-police yet most of this subreddit still want to claim that these protesters are just pro-eu democrats . 
  fascist flag on the coffin of recently dead ` protester ' http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/26/ukraine-protester-funeral-mourners-kiev this flag http://www.shekhovtsov.org/articles/una-unso_symbol.jpg ( link about the group which uses it http://www.shekhovtsov.org/articles/anton_shekhovtsov-state_of_the_far_right_in_ukraine.html ) let 's imagine that there were anti-government protests going on in washington dc . 
  the most active and violent protesters were members of an openly neo-nazi group , they set fires outside the white house , shot at police , kidnapped members of the american government and threatened to overthrow it unless their demands were met . 
  these neo-nazis also hate trade unionists , jews and ethnic minorities . 
  during these violent protests prominent politicians from iran and russia meet with the leaders of these neo-nazis and encourage their ` democratic protest ' . 
  that is what is happening in ukraine . 
  these protests are full of fascists http://www.channel4.com/news/kiev-svoboda-far-right-protests-right-sector-riot-police, 
  yes , maybe if you spent a bit more time actually reading stuff rather than wanking about being the prime monster and nuking foreigners that might be a help to you . 
  your yes answer seems to be based on total conjecture . 
  why do you think there is massive ambiguity around this question ? 
  i honestly do not give a shit about international ` respect ' of the uk or eu , maybe if we had a little less international ` respect ' then our government would n't desperately try and rush into wars . 
  maybe britain could get a bit more respect by at least slowing the explosion of growth of food banks , i would respect that a lot more than the country having the ability ( and not even that , we need the permission of the americans ) to nuke ordinary people like me in russia or iran . 
  one of the few aspects of austerity i agree with , though it 's targeting personnel rather than nuclear weapons which is what i would prefer to be gotten rid of . 
  britain should have scrapped trident decades ago . 
  lots of svoboda fascists, 
  i 'm unsure what i think about this issue , i 've gone from being totally in favour of decriminalisation to wondering about just how much legalised prostitution promotes an increase in trafficking . 
  it 's a much more complicated issue than moralists and libertarians portray it as . 
  one thing that 's obvious to me though is that there is a lot of thinly disguised `` hands off my whores '' mra sentiment , using this alternative view as an excuse to attack feminism and by extension women in general . 
  where are all the eu apologists who claimed that the eu was necessary because it was a counterweight to nsa violations of privacy ? 
  the eu is as bad as dc and london on this . 
  they missed out the peoples of europe voting . 
  got any advice on thwarting racist attacks ? 
  this is amazing . 
  bravo . 
  haha yes , i heard that when it was first broadcast . . very funny, 
  the famous germanic sense of humour to the rescue !,
