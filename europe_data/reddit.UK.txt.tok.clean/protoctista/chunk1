  i 'm going to be back here on the 18th to see if you were right . 
  is that just a lack of * officially registered * jobs ? 
  where have you been living for the last 5 years ? 
   geographically close [ u wot m8 ? 
  i 'm starting to hate the word ` tourism ' now because twats like this do n't know what it means . 
  it all started at ` benefit tourism ' and now it 's gotten out of hand . 
  it 's not fucking ` tourism ' if people go because they * do n't want to die in agony . 
  yes , public beheading . 
  wait , no , we have this thing called _ not being a barbaric cunt . _ ugh . 
  i need to go for a walk . 
   bagel-loving how *** dare *** you . 
  well how about you try commuting up the peaks every day , you tulip-sniffing clog-monkey . 
  everything 's coming up uk . 
  ` living room ' . 
  * the horror . 
  yeah , i did n't quite understand that either . 
  permanent security council seat , individually represented in g20 , g7 , most powerful city in the world , nuclear weapons , etc. 
  are you ... are you for real ? 
  now , you would say that as a cypriot , would n't you ? 
  i 'm not sure i can count the number of different armies in your country . 
  [ yeah ... that 's not gon na happen . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_security_and_defence_policy ), 
  yeah we can throw all of these into the `` history repeating itself '' pile . 
  i think it 's a good comparison , putin wants the return of the soviet union such as hitler wanted a return of the german empire , both of which were still in recent memory . 
  so anschlu\u00df and all that . 
  hey , sorry if you get asked this a lot , but why do you type everything twice ?

  i 'd better move to rutland then, 
  they might as well just adopt swiss-style direct democracy . 
  i know i 'd like that . 
  wew banter claus is coming to town, 
  i 'm not sure that 's whataboutism . 
  would n't whataboutism be if europeans were criticised by islamic countries for forcing all muslims to wear baboon head-sized crucifixes and we responded with ` well , in iran , christian european women are forced to wear hijabs , so you ca n't talk ' ? 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 
  it 's beautiful . 
  damn , notch has really hit a low point . 
  i 'd say this is more based on a rivalry similar to the uk 's & france 's rather than hatred for another race of people . 
  why ? 
  because it was nazi-era or something ? 
  it is . 
  ja and fucking faroe and \u00c5land and shit . 
  come on now , not all problems can be blamed on basic ideologies . 
  i 've got to be honest , i 've never heard the name either . 
  i 'm ignorant of most things , though . 
  what does it actually mean ? 
  does it relate to the uk 's opt-out of the euro ? 
  ah thanks , just viewed it on my laptop . 
  my phone just showed the full 360 \u00b0 view at once . 
  was trippy . 
  he 's four . 
  when i see protests occurring in foreign countries , there 's always at least one sign in english . 
  it 's always a bit odd to me even though i know it is n't odd at all . 
  english is basically now our galactic basic standard . 
  maybe it 's because he ca n't . 
  that 's the way i interpreted it , myself . 
  spot on . 
  for a moment i thought this was some old photograph recoloured or something . 
  then i saw the motor yacht . 
  football ? 
  problematic *, 
  other half, 
  yes , poland - join the dark side . 
  the fuck do you mean `` sadly '' ? 
  go on , annex him . 
  hey , nigel . 
  unrelated question : do you really live in s\u00e1pmi ? 
  everyone 's talking about bloody nuclear plants in this sub . 
  bye old mechanic man, 
  yeah i 'd be down with that . 
  aw , the podhala\u0144ski looks like a golden retriever . 
  i do n't think you would invade multiple countries if you thought you would lose . 
  `` i wish you good fortune in the wars to come . '', 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ like ^ ^ where ^ ^ this ^ ^ is ^ ^ going . 
  i actually like the ` european federation ' . 
  sounds spacey . 
  we 'll spend money using european credits or some shit . 
  well , we seem to be doing alright here . 
  and really , is n't that all that matters ? 
  that 's hilarious . 
  taitwo numba two ? 
  united by ikea . 
  that 's actually pretty awesome . 
  stick a big fan in front of it . 
  i do n't see why you ca n't just stick a turbine in one of those things . 
  it 'd be tricky to find a picture more dutch than this . 
  well is n't that a nice big fuck you to russia . 
  kazakhstan should join , because kazakhstan of brick . 
  too designated,
