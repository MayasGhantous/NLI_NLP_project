  aw but london fits so nicely in the centre of the world map . 
  ... where they put it . 
  ^ ^ ^ wow ^ wow ^ ^ wow ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ wow ^ ^ wow ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ wow ^ ^ ^ wow ^ ^ ^ ^ wow wow ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ wow ^ ^ ^ wow ^ wow, 
  the union breaks up , all countries apart from england rejoin eu , then after a while england also rejoins tail between legs and accepts schengen and obligation to join euro . 
  if only . 
  for me . 
  it would be extremely limiting . 
  well if scotland and northern ireland break off then wales had better . 
  just to complete it , y' know ? 
  by the way , is your flair the abbasid caliphate ? 
  cool, 
  i and half the country did n't vote for this , mate . 
  god , me too , actually . 
  it 's going to be marvellous . 
  was in uk, 
  another could be scottish independence , and a united ireland ... amongst other possibilities . 
  it was always traditionally the socialists who were sceptical of the eec , at least in my country . 
  are n't syriza vaguely eurosceptic ? 
  and boris . 
  take me with you . 
  oh shit good point . 
  i 'm actually super surprised with some of the countries being named in this thread . 
  do n't stay . 
  yes !, 
  we 're all individuals !, 
  could be pumps , could be a shitload of sandbags . 
  some folks i know have [ these ] ( http://stormguardfloodplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/a-front-door-uses-a-flood-barrier-to-stop-flood-water.jpg ) on their front and back doors . 
  dear god . 
  how much pressure can a pub window withstand ? 
  maybe we switch places with the africans , eh ? 
  by 75 years - til . 
  for a second , i thought your flair was the kingdom of yugoslavia . 
  i remember when a whole-page message in the daily mail signed by viktor orb\u00e1n was published , urging uk citizens to vote remain . 
  i 'm honestly not sure what that says . 
  people do n't change . 
  you 're slippin ' jimmy . 
  oh my fucking god , go outside . 
  after that 's happened , can the celtic union please colonise us just to make the map look pretty again ? 
  thanks . 
  if the tory hard right are still calling for it , they 'll get what they want . 
  waterman projection everywhere . 
  i 'd be fine with that as long as you invade us . 
  i guess the point for op is that the migrants should n't be there without prior fluency in the native tongue . 
  or at all , idk . 
  brown *, 
  finally , someone said it . 
  in spanish it 's ` pi\u00f1a ' . 
  a nan ass ? 
  you 're bloody right some religions are better than others . 
  we all need to be a bit more jain in my opinion . 
  oh , so what did the declaration of sovereignty of ssr moldova in 1990 mean for moldova and the soviet union ? 
  is it just that ` sovereignty ' is a vague term that i misinterpreted as meaning ' a separate state ' when in fact it just means something along the lines of ` home rule ' ? 
  apparently , you 're * only just * correct !, 
  on june 23 , 1990 moldavian ssr was declared a sovereign entity - less than a month after the vote to recognise lithuania 's restoration of the independence on may 31 . 
  `` what ever happened to the popular front , reg ? '', 
  `` he 's over there . '', 
  i like to see the ` breaking news ' icon be for something positive for a change . 
  now that is classy - and emotive . 
  i was also wondering if that 's what the sign-holder was implying , but i doubt it . 
  so what 's the craic with this soros bloke ? 
  i know he 's a businessman with a record of controversies with regards to currency speculation , and i know he 's funded various political movements and action groups - including hillary clinton 's presidential campaign . 
  but what 's everyone on about when they 're saying * he 's * the one behind the migrant crisis and the ` eradication of white europeans ' ? 
  what exactly points to that ? 
  ooh i like it . 
  my thoughts exactly !, 
  thanks for this . 
  i hope it happens . 
  that 's why i have this flair . 
  the union is past its expiry date . 
   [ you got me ] ( https://youtu.be/xftguwwzaeu?t=35s ), 
  forgive me , i only speak aspergers . 
  united kingdom, 
  i wonder if this 'll be the beginning of the end for the union . 
  not gon na lie , i 'd be pretty smug too if i were in their position . 
  french/german/dutch national rail groups have an exceedingly clever system in taking advantage of uk privatisation - and it only makes sense that they would do . 
  it 's the tory party that introduced privatisation . 
  they 're the real target in this , unlike the advert you linked . 
  the smug europeans is just an easy way to attach a face to what 's happening . 
  no , you misunderstand . 
  it 's presenting the european rail model as a superior one . 
  the campaign is for cheaper , publicly-owned railways , not against european ownership . 
  it would n't be britain if the houses were n't all a copy-and-paste of the one next to it . 
  anyway , your country 's houses are basically large garden sheds from what i can tell . 
   ugly houses . 
  ctrl+f 'd for this . 
  well , everything 's sorted . 
  maybe . 
  nato , however ... 
  now that is vintage . 
  oh hey , it 's ken m. 
   finnish flair we share this stereotype , bud . 
  ... are we doing a snowpiercer right now ? 
  this is why we should just go ahead and implement solar geoengineering . 
  this ca n't be healthy . 
  i remember watching this story from an australian news team who were reporting on the migrants in rinkeby . 
  before they entered , the police told them they would not be accompanied for fear of inciting unrest . 
  maybe not a ` no-go zone ' ( not entirely sure what that means ) , but it does n't exactly seem desirable . 
  edit : [ found it . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/br0tgy4puvo?t=11m16s ), 
  could 've been a plain white field .
