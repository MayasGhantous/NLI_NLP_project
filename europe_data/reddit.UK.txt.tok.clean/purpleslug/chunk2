  this mod is ** fucking scum . 
  * really * impressive . 
  they will catch up . 
  although , genius , there are three ** countries ** and one province ( disputed ) in the ** sovereign state ** of the united kingdom . 
  i bolded things in case you did n't get it . 
  the best bit is that this election is on my birthday . 
  i 'm happy . 
  hungary is n't exactly great, 
  you 've got to admit that it was pretty funny though, 
  they 're not that suicidal - oh , wait . 
  hey , we got universal suffrage last month ; women can vote as well . 
   from a truly uk citizen like you you are asking for a flame war now . 
  shut up . 
  he was a candidate for a pariah party , so i doubt it . 
  plus it was a local election, 
  ... lol , no . 
  it 's opportunistic populism, 
  fidesz is retarded . 
  viktor orban was the head of liberal international as well . 
  so hypocritical . 
  i 'm cheering from england . 
  can you hear it ? 
  nursultan , still rocking and rigging as a crooked old man . 
  do you think that the ump will win the election ? 
  that is the story of the entirety of europe . 
  not at all , i 've advocated it for a while . 
  it 's the best way to counter russia and further develop the democracy and economies of these countries . 
  they have a socialist , left-wing government . 
  this should n't be happening . 
  edit : i mean the ps should n't be doing this , it 's not like they 're conservative and pro-invasion of privacy . 
  at least , i thought they were n't . 
  spain wo n't do that sadly . 
  something about being a democratic , respectful country , unlike argentina during junta rule . 
  i 'd support merkel invading us . 
  all hail the moon sized death laser . 
  gibraltar is british . 
  that simple . 
  there have been referendums - democratic referendums - that the spanish government , a democratic one , must accept . 
  there is no justification to ignore this . 
  ahmet davotoglu or something , i do n't know how to spell his name . 
  very likely to be successor , important in akp . 
  let 's just pretend that quebec does n't exist . 
  that 's a very tough question . 
  all shall fall to the greater icelandic empire !, 
  hey , at least we would be further away from france . 
  yes , but iceland is small so it 's justifiable, 
  europe ! = eu . 
  britain ca n't escape being european , even with a brexit, 
  related subs : / r/islamunveiled backs away slowly, 
  good on you , poland !, 
  kek, 
  i 'm pretty sure that they 're both turkish . 
  it 's not `` 100 % '' . 
  often , housing systems compound these issues . 
   they 're basically an american military hegemony . 
  this part is wrong . 
  we 're a western collective defence arrangement . 
  not american lackeys . 
  precisely - the limit will be introduced on the 15th, 
  indeed . 
  agreed . 
  pr would solve so many issues . 
  and then federalisation . 
  but i 'm getting ahead of myself here . 
  also known as prime minister 's questions . 
  as has been mentioned earlier , the snp are chill with losing representation in exchange for pr , given how heavily they 've been fucked over historically . 
  eventually , yes . 
  av would have made a more unproportional result in 2015 than fptp . 
  claiming that it is proportional representation is a pretence . 
   after they retake kaliningrad oblast anything to get rid of kaliningrad oblast ... 
  he is scum . 
  i welcome this turn of events, 
  i guess , yes . 
  it is anecdotal . 
  i 'd heavily encourage going there nonetheless . 
  it 's a bit chilling . 
  the trips were subsidised at my school , and most of the year goes, 
  nah , many schools organise trips to the war cemeteries . 
  it 's a very common trip, 
  ~ ~ l m a o ~ ~ *** bb is doubleplus good ***, 
  i do n't think that you 've got any knowledge on the matter at all . 
  the saudi army is incredibly sophisticated . 
  britain 's defence contractors make far too much profit from 'em . 
  of course not . 
  but , arguably , it is a far worse procedure for far worse reasons . 
  that would require being closer to ~ ~ that ex-colony ~ ~ the united states . 
  we might turn into them . 
  ` europe ' , in this instance , is a short-hand reference to the ` european union ' . 
  i thought that this was established . 
  i 'm fully aware that we live in a european country , whether we like it or not . 
  fgm is much less prevalent , so no, 
  this rude attitude is n't helping anyone . 
  you 're just alienating pro-european britons . 
  if it went down to -5 , i 'd be campaigning for brexit . 
  it 's the british thing to do ;-), 
  precisely . 
   in flanders , the genitals of children and teenagers get checked by a doctor during mandatory school visits to get vaccinated and fully checked every year or so . 
  i 'm not educated on this matter , but i certainly hope that it 's with consent . 
  i would not consent to that ; i 'd rather keep my liberty . 
   these communities love big government , as long as said government exclusively represents , protects and expands their interests .
