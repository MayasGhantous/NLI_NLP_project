  have you had previous experience as a mod inside or outside of reddit ? 
  | i am a moderator of two small-sized political subreddits , / r/uspolitics ( 8,100 ) and / r/mhoc ( 3,200 ) - and i am a sysop on a gaming wiki . 
  however , these subreddits get a fair amount of traffic for their size and i am an active moderator . 
  the former in particular has an active `` core '' of the community which can be pretty rowdy . 
  what do you like the most about / r/europe ? 
  | the slice-of-life threads . 
  [ oh , and things like this . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4vdvs4/romania/ ) on / r/europe we can joke about our countries in an open community and i like that . 
  i really enjoy / r/europe when it is positive , humorous and dare i say _ banterous . _ my mantra is that positivity is something that is great , even in moderation . 
  ( hehe ) do you believe in working as a team or mostly working alone ? 
  | the former . 
  from my experience , you can never really ` work alone ' when moderating : there are always decisions that require discussion ( in the modmail ) ; whilst removing obvious spam ( which i am very used to dealing with as a janitor mod ) is something that can be done unilaterally , on issues such as `` agenda pushing '' it would be prudent to discuss things . 
  banning is obviously a last resort , and it is my opinion that discussions should be held before any banning ( apart from banning obvious spammers and reporting them to / r/spam ) . 
  i also have slack , discord and skype available for communicating with other moderators of / r/europe , and i find these platforms invaluable , especially due to reasons like this . 
  i have toolbox installed and am willing to use other platforms for moderation if it 's necessary . 
  in general , how would you evaluate / r/europe 's rules ? 
  | i think that the rules are concise and good on / r/europe , but there are a few changes that i would support . 
  these include clarifying rule 5b ) to note that there is moderator discretion on what is `` unreliable '' , because the example list states just alt-right websites with it not being _ apparent _ whether extremist websites on the left are also put under the `` unreliable '' fold . 
  what change would you make in / r/europe if you could ? 
  | daily discussion threads are always good !, 
  by this , i do n't mean a special post for _ every _ day necessarily , but threads that are posted weekly on particular days . 
  ( perhaps just weekdays . ), 
  / r/unitedkingdom has them and they 're very successful . 
  daily discussion threads do help to make a subreddit positive , which is something that is obviously desirable . 
  i also think that the moderation should make clear that comments should keep a positive attitude . 
  / r/europe is mostly there by prohibiting personal attacks , racism and the like : but ` be positive ' really needs to be canonised !, 
  why do you want to join / r/europe 's mod team ? 
  | i would like to moderate a larger , more active subreddit that i actually read - / r/europe . 
  do n't get me wrong : i am not an opportunist , and i do n't think that / r/europe is a stepping stone ; that would be ridiculous , as this is a massive subreddit !, 
  i really dislike the attitude that it 's okay to become a moderator of multiple smaller subreddits and just jump up the ladder as some sort of power-mod , and rest assured it is not one that i have . 
  i am applying because i feel that i 've got the aptitude to moderate a larger subreddit , having developed the skillset of a janitorial mod , and i want to put that to use in a larger community where it really feels i 'm helping and part of something greater . 
  so far i only average about 120 moderator actions per week , but i only moderate subreddits totalling 12,000 subscribers . 
  nonetheless , i strongly feel that i am capable of the additional workload required to help i the moderation of a subreddit of this size , and for that reason i am capable of meeting any set targets due to my activity and diligence . 
  do you think politically neutral moderation is achievable and/or desirable ? 
  | yes , politically neutral moderation is achievable and unequivocally desirable . 
  it is not politically biased to remove inflammatory and bigoted posts and comments , or posts from unreputable sources . 
  that 's just reasonable moderation . 
  of course , if a moderator has a conflict of interest with a thread needing moderation , they should refrain from actively moderating that thread out of principle . 
  but i can stress that i am used to being politically neutral due to the nature of the subreddits that i moderate ; and i also have a sharp eye for what is acceptable and what is not acceptable . 
  it is very much feasible to uphold the rules of / r/europe and be politically neutral in your duties as a moderator , and as a mod of / r/europe i would strive to do that . 
  why would n't we ??? 
  the soviet union completely dissolved into over a dozen states and russia still retained their seat , with less of an overall population of the soviet union than england has in the united kingdom . 
  350 billion pounds p/w would be quite a nice amount ... even with sterling falling . 
  i 'd take that . 
  thank you . 
  you make the citizenry of the fatherland and people 's republic proud . 
  glory to dear leader !, 
  no , that 's the entirety of russia . 
  oh god that 's painful to look at . 
  yeah - anecdotal evidence is typically a synonym of `` bullshit '' when it comes to things like this . 
  it 's an independent commission . 
  the idea is less seats , and all seats having more similar electorate sizes . 
  right now they 're out of whack and it 's `` unfair '' , so to speak . 
  labour is moaning because this disproportionately affects their seats , with them tanking in the polls violently ( the conservatives are about fifteen points ahead in the polls ) . 
  yeah , that is used in tandem with ams ( which is known as personalised proportional representation or mixed-member proportional representation ) . 
  ams is used in the scottish parliament and unproportionally in the welsh assembly . 
  it could well become the electoral system for the house of commons in the future . 
  you are a complete bellend . 
  here 's to the future !, 
   but the us benefits a lot from a weak europe . 
  kek, 
  i mean , sure . 
  but establishments like * the times * and * wall street journal * are n't susceptible to the terrible journalism . 
  which is what he 's saying bro, 
  why does this have to happen non-stop ? 
  it 's just distressing . 
  absolutely terrible news , i hope the man who did this is apprehended as soon as possible and that nobody has died, 
  dude saw both threads on top/hour and wanted to comment on both ? 
  are you dumb ? 
  they do ... ? 
  not everything is in europe , although i do get your point . 
  i do hope that we stay in the eea . 
  that is just ridiculous . 
  because afd started as a liberal-conservative party , with a liberal-conservative leader . 
  moderate eurosceptics , as it were . 
  as a brit , i love the fdp . 
  but not this . 
  berlin is objectively inferior . 
  it did , the liberals made alfa with lucke, 
  i 'd support this . 
  gove is a social-liberal , broadly . 
  yes , clearly that 's why the brandenburg gate is draped in the turkish flag . 
  the pound is screwed anyway mate !, 
  ^ euro please, 
  i have physics , which i can afford to fuck up anyway . 
  i 'm sorry , europe :'(, 
  we do n't want you because you 've got a tinpot dictator-in-line . 
  can they fuck off for a month ? 
  edit : even better , a prank . 
  they can still fuck off, 
  fucking law and justice . 
  this is why the tories should n't have started aecr . 
  we 're with the european equivalent of redneck loonies . 
  it does , lol, 
  estonia , be more like us : north european and having no friends . 
  :p no need to try to join the nordic cool kids club when you can be angry and eurosceptic !, 
  try it now and be disliked by every other european country . 
  good on you germany ; unfortunately parliament is too cowardly over here . 
  lol, 
  due to federalism at different speeds .
