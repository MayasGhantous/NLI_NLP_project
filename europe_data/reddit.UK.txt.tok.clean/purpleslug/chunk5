  which is perfectly fine . 
  google `` joke '' . 
  i need to throw more money at them . 
   you are introducing an artificial bias . 
  without such an artificial bias both tails would be equidistant . 
  if the left is centre-left , then also the right would be centre-right . 
  yes , i 'm not disagreeing with that . 
  but the fpo are n't centre-right . 
  parties like the [ tories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conservative_party_ ( uk \\ ) ) are centre-right . 
   that depends on the definitions of ` european ' and ` green ' . 
  `` european greens '' by definition stand for europeanness , thus they stand for conservative nativism and animism and stand against mass migrations . 
  international `` european green '' is an oxymoron , just as `` representative democracy '' . 
  the european greens contain the vast majority of green parties in the eu . 
  yes , there are conservative greens like the ecologist greens of mexico , but the majority of the green movement are socially liberal . 
  green politics in itself does n't have links to any social policy , i do n't believe . 
  because you have green social conservatives , social liberals , and even [ green economic liberals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_liberal_party_of_switzerland ) . 
  ah , i do n't do political science . 
  i 'm aware that it 's often used to describe authoritarian government , but not exclusively . 
   both tails are equidistant from the centre . 
  the left is just as extreme as the right . 
  well yes . 
  but the centre-left is not equidistant to the centre in comparison to the far-right . 
  geometrically . 
  logically . 
  even on a two-dimensional grid , the greens would be closer to the centre than the freedom party . 
   a `` green '' allowing mass migrations is not really a green . 
  true greens are conservative nativists / animists , who oppose mass migrations . 
  unfortunately the european greens might disagree with you on that   relative centrism makes you not extreme . 
   that depends on the context . 
  it might as well . 
  it means that you 're moderate . 
  you can be aggressively moderate , i guess . 
  i tend to like those candidates . 
  i also get your hyperbole , but not really ( considering that i 've used `` regime '' ), 
  one is vaguely centre-left . 
  the other is far-right . 
  even left-wing politics is n't extreme . 
  even right-wing politics is n't extreme . 
  it 's when you go further than those boundaries , you 're extreme . 
  that 's hofer , and a militant socialist would also be extreme in my book . 
  relative centrism makes you not extreme . 
  true , but in terms of dictionary blahblah , they 're synonymous terms . 
  i get that `` regime '' has different connotations , and is used in different contexts , but i do n't feel that / u/andyawesome was implying that austria is governed by a backwater dictatorship . 
  a regime is a government mate , the term is just often used in a negative manner, 
  you are misconstruing what i mean by `` triumphant '' . 
  perhaps i 'll change the wording, 
  i get you . 
  i am looking too short-term . 
  as i said in another thread , this sets up the fpo really well to a parliamentary election . 
  the two main parties got totally stomped . 
  when somebody puts `` as [ x ] '' , or whatever , it 's best to assume that they 're memeing . 
  triumphant in the regard that the far-right did n't win during a right-wing populist surge across europe . 
  that is something to be happy about , especially when we compare it to the first round, 
  yeah , i get you . 
  right-wing populism is surging in europe because people feel that their views are n't being catered for . 
  either way this is a ** huge ** high water mark for the fpo , and it sets them up for a parliament election very well indeed . 
  ~ ~ afaik he 's right , but that 's meaningless . 
  i will have a look for the statistics but afaik it 's a huge lead for the green with intellectuals and a huge lead for hofer with the more uneducated working class ~ ~ see / u/g _ fucking_g 's comment ; i could n't find the exit poll that had it in . 
  no need to downvote people for their opinions lads ( note that i said this when vaguely `` liberal '' comments were being buried , like mine which went down to -7 in about a minute . 
  it goes either way - do n't downvote right wing people or left wing people , that 's not what the voting system is for ), 
  a ~ ~ triumphant ~ ~ pleasant victory , given the first round , for anti-extremism , and a sigh of relief for the centre . 
  but that was worryingly close . 
  -- edit : contentious wording, 
  afaik the pvda vote is going to collapse . 
  guess what the pvv electorate are ... 
  the vvd have also slumped a bit in the polls . 
  the pvv are going to gain seats next time around , that 's ' a certain . 
  edit : capitalisation, 
  switzerland is very lucky , and very enviable :p, 
  because they do n't know how to assimilate . 
  it sucks . 
  how lovely . 
  nah , religious private schools are fine imo , they just need to be inspected like other schools and follow the national curriculum only . 
  you 're on the wrong planet . 
  * that shit is unacceptable anywhere and we should be proactive in making that message clear . 
  yeah haha, 
  no , that was in response to the `` tax haven '' argument . 
  it is n't a tax haven . 
  cheers for downvoting me by the way . 
  the flag is the wrong way round vertically . 
  what a nice place . 
  or the falkland islands ... 
  oh yeah , of course . 
  yeah , integration is really important . 
  i 'm saying that from an ethnic minority background . 
  there is a difference between suppressing freedom of religion ( and being racist ) and expecting that different values systems do n't take place in your country . 
  it 's pretty simple . 
  like , this is a two way street . 
  immigrants have brought a lot to my country ( the uk ) , especially in terms of national culture . 
  so society has been more accommodating . 
  but the onus is on immigrants to follow social norms ( such as knowing the language of the country ) . 
  inb4 germany eats all of it again . 
  never gon na turn around and desert you ... ... 
  yep ... 
  same , as with 48.1 % of our country !, 
  they 're economically right-wing you spazmoid . 
  hence why they endorsed the conservative party . 
  stop talking because you just look like a retard . 
  that is an issue , i feel , because letting a million in like that so quickly means that countries ca n't provide for them . 
  adding onto the fact that not all of those people are really refugees ( and refugees are much more than those coming from syria , but are n't exactly people who come from the stable countries in africa ... ) having a better apparatus for these people would decrease any problems , but that means all countries ( including the v4 ) taking their fair share .
