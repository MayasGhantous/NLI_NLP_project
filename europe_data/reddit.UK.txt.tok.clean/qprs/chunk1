but in this case google play has never not required those apps . 
  it 's not something they suddenly started to do once they had a monopoly . 
  you could definitely write an android runtime for another os . 
  google themselves did it ( and later gave up ) . 
  android is open source . 
  aosp is short for ** android ** open source project . 
  xiaomi 's skin of android is still android , they even advertise it as such . 
  google 's software package called google services is not open source , but this is not necessary to use android . 
  all jobs in london typically pay more than the national average salary for that job . 
  but the truth is this : ** pick one : ** ( 1 ) low pay job ( 2 ) ability to settle down, 
  ha , i 've just had that conversation with an american friend ( and it 's especially relevant now ) . 
  i live in london and i have an existential crisis every time i look at my ( lack of ) savings . 
  that 's the thing . 
  london is * the * place to be if you want to try every cuisine in the world . 
   i 've seen many on / r/unitedkingdom who seriously undervalue their own country you just do n't understand our culture . 
  we happily undermine our country among ourselves but if you do it then you 're literally hitler . 
   you guys could work a little on your cuisine , though . 
  do n't you like curry ? 
  that 's essentially british cuisine now . 
   how com they have n't made a `` the polish are coming '' documentary series ? 
  because frankly they 're here already and it would be a disaster if they left because they are very efficient and a lot of their industries are facing workforce shortages . 
  hey , most brits are indifferent to romania . 
  i for one am incredibly jealous of your internet . 
  unfortunately the methodology of your source is of questionable legitimacy . 
  or tallinn , the murder capital of europe . 
  they do n't do it anymore because bbc1 has 24 hour programming now . 
  masochism is when you hurt yourself . 
  if spain invaded gibraltar without a democratic mandate , the british military is superior to that of spain and it would immediately ensure that british sovereignty over gibraltar is restored without any help or interference from other nato members . 
  if negotiations take place afterwards , i do n't think the british government would be willing to compromise with spain ( why would they ? ) . 
  i 'm sure that an immense amount of pressure would be put on spain to ensure that they back down and the status quo is restored . 
  however , if they do n't then spain would be the aggressor and therefore nato members would theoretically side with britain against spain if the conflict escalates . 
  the scenario of turkey had a very different balance of power with regards to the aggressor and the victim , thus a compromise was reached . 
  so a referendum is held , gibraltar wants to remain with the uk , spain disagrees and an agreement is not reached ? 
  how would spain annexe gibraltar in the first place , if not through some kind of military force ? 
  you 're saying that the uk would not be entitled to push back , and/or nobody would help if the uk were not capable of doing it on its own ? 
  actually , if spain annexed gibraltar ( because they sure are n't winning any referendums ) then nato would be obliged to side with the uk . 
  all i 'm saying is that this :  the guardian are just as bad as the sun if blablabla is said way too often and it 's just disingenuous . 
  i know that people in general hold the guardian higher than the sun . 
  sounds exactly like `` yeah but hillary 's just as bad as trump '' . 
  yes they 're both not great but one 's an order of a magnitude shittier . 
  here have this : #\u00df, 
  ah , switzerland . 
  i spent some time at eth zurich and i loved the country . 
  if us attacked eu , nobody would survive as both have nukes . 
  good thing may is taking us out of the echr . 
  off to tower hill with you . 
  traitor . 
  well , you compared them to the sith . 
  unless you believe / r/empiredidnothingwrong ... 
  yeah , i know . 
  that 's why i just found it amusing that there 's a russian on here criticising fn . 
  ^ ( * sees russian flag * ) hey , get back to shitposting on the_donald !, 
  far right parties all over the world currently have a hate boner for angela merkel . 
  they need a pantomime villain , and hillary clinton lost so she 's the natural replacement . 
  probably because the government of the 80s decided to do a massive economic restructuring and killed thousands of jobs . 
  it literally could n't have gotten any worse . 
  [ bloody hell . 
  # 92.50 for 2.5 grams ?

  from my experience as a tourist in india , they find it acceptable to say things like `` wow you 're too skinny , you need to eat some food '' or `` wow you 're really fat '' even to people they barely know . 
  that would be absolutely awkward if you said it in many places in europe . 
  ca n't read a bit of it , but that was some fancy article . 
  spent a couple of minutes scrolling and pretending to read it . 
  said invaders are now ancestors of current brits . 
  huh . 
  there 's a gnu radio . 
  last time i checked a mere is a lake . 
  they do ? 
  what ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  we voted for brexit , but i doubt we 'd vote for somebody like hofer . 
  the tories are still pretty popular right now . 
  who ? 
  we often forget that we 're an island about 20 miles off the coast of france . 
  size and updates . 
  it makes sense to have one central dependency that is regularly updated because it means that apps do n't need to bundle it with them making them smaller ( especially since these devices are constrained for storage ) . 
  that 's because they use apple 's apis . 
  that 's because large apps can afford to build their own framework for push notifications . 
  most small developers will rely on google 's apis . 
   anything else ? 
  low power location , maps , chromecast , in-app purchases , subscriptions , advertising , analytics . 
  you might not personally use these things , but a modern mobile platform absolutely needs these things to attract developers and users , something that your platform of choice has failed to do . 
  i do n't know , maybe push notifications for a start ? 
  it will also make android terrible to use . 
  most of these proprietary features are taken for granted by mobile users . 
  yes , but they went from 1 to 13 mps and are propping may 's government up right now . 
  only place where the tories made gains . 
  no independence = following england out of the eu . 
  independence is the only real chance of staying in ( not that i would suggest independence , that 's stupid in its own right ) . 
  if scotland were kicking and screaming it would n't have voted tory that much in the last election . 
  what makes you think that ? 
  he 's on target for an immense majority ( by french standards ) so if he carries out his agenda of liberalisations he could possibly witness massive economic growth ( but he probably should n't go full thatcher ) . 
  i 'm optimistic . 
  i think he 'll get far more done than obama ever managed . 
  she 'd have to step down if she lost . 
  it would be the ultimate embarrassment . 
  i do n't think there 's any machiavellian scheming behind this . 
  she 's just a terrible campaigner with some questionable policy ideas . 
  it appears to be a one sided alliance because they did n't afford us any such courtesy , 
  go ahead , they 're both the same thing nowadays anyway .
