[ ~ 75 % of syrians support hamas ] ( http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/upimagestft/tft%20syria%20poll%20report.pdf ) . 
  i ca n't believe there are people in this sub now defending the importation into germany of a population in which a large majority are budding anti-semitic fascists . 
  you 'll never learn from history because you refuse to face the facts about what these people think . 
  yeah , we 'll just let the kurds fight isis on their own without air support . 
  a sense of self-satisfaction , despite the fact that far more could be helped in the region with the same amount of money . 
  they are abandoning many in refugee camps in the region and they just do n't give a fuck . 
  they 're between 5-10 % in france and there are already massive issues . 
  if you double or triple that they 'll only become more explodey and they 'll only scream `` islamophobia '' more . 
  when these particular bigots are protected by the left from public criticism it 's going to be a tough battle . 
   at the moment like i said , 150-200 years from now demographics will have shifted enough to make it a reality . 
  then europe is fucked . 
  oh , the burning irony . 
  if an islamist government came to power in germany ( possible in the next 150-200 years ) they 'd be far worse than anything afd would do . 
  afd are just standing up against some of the worst bigots on the planet . 
  what does the colour of their skin have to do with anything ? 
  it 's the fact that a large number of them are bigots of the kind you 'd find in 17th century europe . 
  arseholes , basically . 
  it 's brilliant is n't it ? 
  if only bradford , luton and east london were n't completely rotten to the core with the electoral practices of pakistan and bangladesh i would laugh . 
  unfortunately labour have fucked so much up and allowed in so many bigots that it will only be funny once they fully implode at the ge in 2020 . 
  you ca n't even do basic maths . 
  this morning he put out a statement saying she was n't being suspended , then backtracked four hours later . 
  a survey of 1 is n't representative . 
  multiple surveys have showed that a majority of british muslims are utter arseholes . 
  52 % want homosexuality criminalised as opposed to 5 % of the general population ? 
  that 's a problem , because i 'd rather my sexuality was n't illegal . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/07/muslims-britain-france-germany-homosexuality http://www.civitas.org.uk/publications/sharia-law-or-one-law-for-all/ ( page 14 most notably ), 
  yep , but when will you still stop supporting their freedom to be bigots ? 
  when they gain serious voting power ? 
  you in the late 1930s :  i 've spent time in nazi strongholds in germany before , never had a problem . 
  the ship has sailed anyway , if you wanted to be annoyed about it you should have done it 10 years ago . 
  a disgusting betrayal of european values . 
  go and do a survey of their views on homosexuality , apostates , gender equality etc. 
  you 'll care then . 
  not infiltrated so much as , basically , the northern working class towns/inner city london and birmingham where we imported pakistanis and bangladeshis from the 70s to 90s traditionally voted labour anyway , and labour 's open immigration policies attracted the muslim vote , so labour have spent many years sucking up to these muslim communities as a vote winner . 
  they essentially let ` community leaders ' and imams commit electoral fraud via postal votes and other means ( coercion of women ) to guarantee their vote and in return turn a blind eye to the awful shit that goes on in these communities . 
  the rotherham child abuse case is one , and there was also a case recently of muslim women in birmingham being denied the ability to stand as councillors thanks to the patriarchal separate societies in which they live . 
  yes . 
  germany has a moral duty not to import millions of anti-semites but it has done just that , from the most anti-semitic region ( mena ) on the planet . 
  it 's a disgraceful betrayal of germany 's jews . 
  indeed . 
  the weirdest political relationship i 've seen in a long time . 
  to be fair it 's not just your traditional religious bigot anti-semites , you get the hard-left doing it too . 
  [ gerry downing ] ( https://ukmediawatch.org/2016/03/11/gerry-downings-jewish-question/ ) and [ scott nelson ] ( http://everydayantisemitism.com/2015/12/26/british-activist-expelled-from-labour-party-for-jewish-blood-tweets/ ) are two good examples . 
  israel-palestine just seems to turn a lot of people into nutters when they get too deep into it , especially on the palestinians side . 
  so after [ another labour councillor ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/10/labour-councillor-suspended-over-claims-she-called-hitler-the-gr/ ) called hitler the `` greatest man in history '' and a [ former lord mayor of bradford ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/khadim-hussain-former-lord-mayor-of-bradford-suspended-by-labour-party-over-anti-semitism-a6948856.html ) spoke about `` anne frank and the six million zionists '' killed during the holocaust it seems labour have been well and truly infiltrated by scum . 
  do n't worry swedes , it 's not only your left-wing parties that are suffering from a case of extreme tolerance of intolerance . 
  i 'm relatively active in r/exmuslim and i 've seen it a lot that people 's relatives genuinely believe and hope that islam will take over the world one day . 
  they do n't even need to fight for it anymore though , they just need to wait and birth rates will do the rest . 
  to be fair if more people knew they 'd be against the current wave of immigration too . 
  a lot think that just because europe has moved on from conquering the world , everyone thinks the same way . 
  it does n't matter whether it 's banned now or not , because in 100-150 years when muslims gain serious voting power the enlightenment values that europe fought so hard for against fascism and other threats will disappear . 
  we probably wo n't live to see it , but our grandchildren will . 
  that is * so * racist . 
  if we 're going to force muslims to shake hands with women we 'll have to force them to treat gay people as equals which violates their religious freedom . 
  i 've been thinking about starting a petition to the eu that allows the execution of homosexuals and adulterers in muslim-majority neighbourhoods , and only racists would n't sign it . 
  [ this piece of shit ] ( http://thetab.com/2016/04/19/watch-future-nus-president-malia-bouattia-endorse-violent-struggle-87052 ) has just been elected president of the national union of students in the uk . 
  it 's essentially become a club for student lefties to show how ` progressive ' and ` tolerant ' they are by electing muslims , no matter what their actual views are . 
  if only i could afford the plane ticket , watching payback against hamas must be one of the most entertaining sights on the planet . 
  to repost my comment from the previously deleted thread : regarding mehmet kaplan , how did he ever rise so high in the greens ? 
  why are the left allying with people with incredibly conservative views ? 
  i ca n't wait for them to start campaigning to make homosexuality illegal in 20 years because they 're letting their favourite minority set the agenda at the moment , things will only get worse . 
  off-topic how ? 
  ah you 're just being contrarian now really , it 's gone beyond a joke . 
  stop pushing your agenda . 
  i hope it continues to work . 
  it 's happened in the uk too ( in local politics mainly ) that they show their true colours quite often . 
  a couple of examples : [ former lord mayor of bradford suspended by labour party over anti-semitism ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/khadim-hussain-former-lord-mayor-of-bradford-suspended-by-labour-party-over-anti-semitism-a6948856.html ) [ luton labour councillor suspended over hitler tweet ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-36009544 ) but seriously , has nobody thought what happens when sweden 's new immigrants become a serious voting power in the next few decades and have some say over swedish laws ? 
  how , in the framework of democracy , could they ever wish to stop bigoted laws being passed ? 
  regarding mehmet kaplan , how did he ever rise so high in the greens ? 
  why are the left allying with people with incredibly conservative views ? 
  i ca n't wait for them to start campaigning to make homosexuality illegal in 20 years because they 're letting their favourite minority set the agenda at the moment , things will only get worse . 
   he said that islam spoke of equality among men and women at least when they come out with pure shite like this we know to ignore them . 
  the homophobia is a nice touch too , the more they express their bigotry publicly the more people will wake up . 
  i 'm aware , but our link is to the monarchy and that is respected . 
  david cameron understands that , at least . 
  we ( guernsey ) have been a possesion of the crown since before william the conqueror invaded britain , we have the right to govern ourselves and the right to call ourselves british . 
  i 'm sorry that one of the oldest constitutional ties in the world is too complex for you to understand but we are what we are because of over 1,000 years allegiance to the crown , * not * the british government . 
  it 's always good when i see people saying `` they 're running away from the terrorists '' as it it 's that simple . 
  a large majority left because of assad 's regime and your obvious lack of knowledge makes it easy to ignore you . 
  i 'm glad . 
  well , i guess the best idea is a jobs fair in molenbeek so the marginalisation can stop and we can beg them not to blow us up . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://imgur.com/bmkkbwr ) an infographic i saw elsewhere . 
  you 're part of the reason why sweden is fucked . 
  good luck for when your new immigrants become a majority and they vote to criminalise homosexuality etc. 
  import bigots , get a bigoted country . 
  that was my point , 18/19/20 year olds have died for their country in iraq and afghanistan but they ca n't legally have a beer when they go home . 
  srs is mostly yanks so their concept of the child/adult line is already fucked . 
  must n't let 18 year olds drink , but they can go to war !, 
  i 'm talking about now , the present day . 
  so many irish people go `` i 'd love to see reunification '' but that 's like me saying `` i 'd love to see reunification with france '' . 
  the people of ni do n't want to join ireland so respect that . 
   blame everything on the brits nice to see you 've adopted r/ireland 's favourite tactic . 
  and you lads think northern ireland should be yours when it 's obviously ours . 
  ca n't blame your nation 's obvious difficulty with the democratic will of the people . 
  they handed out schengen visas , which is as good as a passport really . 
  i personally informed europol and the met police as soon as i saw the first article in the malta independent , yet it took weeks for a french mep to raise the issue . 
  if it ever turns out that an algerian has so much as stolen from a shop because he was allowed into the eu on one of these visas , malta must be banned from issuing them . 
  absolutely . 
  but the pew polls show it 's well into the hundreds of millions when you ask about support for the death of apostates .
