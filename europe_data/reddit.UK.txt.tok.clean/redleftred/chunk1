morocco and it was a hell . 
  the sahara was good but fez and rissani were not safe places to be . 
  even the hsbc bank clerk short change me . 
  perverts too . 
  come to the uk we have a shared history and you 'll have a better social life as language wont get in the way . 
  i know most europeans speak english but its just one less thing to worry about when moving . 
  i lived in france for a few years and trying to get a medical card or even claiming some tax back in french is a nightmare . 
  skin colour is irrelevant in the uk . 
  you 're an engineer , so you 're middle class and will fit in, 
  you 're wrong . 
  its the second most spoken of native speakers . 
  not the second most spoken in the world . 
  there are 840 million total english speakers and only 420 million spanish speakers . 
  arabic is more popular then spanish . 
  to be fair , if i was born in a country having trouble with modernity id make my way to europe too . 
  there is nothing stoping all of africa walking into germany next summer, 
  the whole planet will be speaking english in a few generations . 
  i agree with you . 
  i too would write a comment but do n't want to get banned . 
  and we wonder why europe is unable to create websites like google ... facebook ... ebay . 
  too much eu bureaucracy, 
  [ and in germany ] ( http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/76383-150627-fearing-syrian-refugees-german-school-bans-miniskirts ), 
  planning ahead for when we leave the eu ( political union ) . 
  stiff upper lip syndrome for brits . 
  in other words , we do n't complain or want to offend people that are trying to be nice to us . 
  you ` ld think they would have chosen a photo with syrians in, 
  thats a [ bingo ] ( https://youtu.be/ugpg8xruhvk?t=6s ), 
  butterscotch for uk, 
  yes , it is the official one for england . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_anthem_of_england ) [ youtube ] ( https://youtu.be/041nxaan714?t=9s ),

  [ full movie is on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooinsdxz59c&amp;spfreload=10 ),

  so staged to try and get some kind of emotional response . 
  i feel sorry for the cops having to deal with this emotional blackmail, 
  cookies no thanks, 
  european culture ? 
  so muslims practicing islam are not european . 
  i just see numbers and some orange . 
  any translation ? 
  a continent is described by race . 
  like a chinaman in britain would be british asian and not a british european . 
  its just a bit of land that helps people work out where your from . 
  citizenship means f all . 
  there is no such thing as an african or asian citizen . 
  yesterday sky news said they were shouting that out while broadcasting live . 
  germany is like a teenager that invited everyone on facebook to a party and when everyone shows up they expect the neighbours to host the party too . 
  its nice but the eu flag is not representative of all european countries . 
  or ... beautiful man made aurora, 
  last year i watched it in a bar in amsterdam and it was a great atmosphere at first but when it got to 4 in the morning people were just tired and going home early . 
  its a great game and im recording it off the tv to watch tomorrow . 
  intelligence agencies protect the public . 
  i expect a spy agency to you know !,

  a lot of anti americanism in this sub, 
  id rather we spend # 20m teaching kids to read and write then waste money on adults that choose to hide behind a burka, 
  explain islamic attacks on thailand , philippines indonesia and china then . 
  the islamists just want to kill all non believers . 
  its us or them . 
  the whole middle east and north africa are too risky for a relaxing holiday . 
  better get your dna tested before the eu bans it https://www.23andme.com/en-gb/, 
  germans are just going to have to integrate better with them . 
  i worship the spaghetti monster . 
  the germans will just have to integrate with them , learn a bit of arabic too . 
  so downloading and not paying should not be aloud and governments cant interfere with the free market . 
  ok im all for ttip then . 
  the difference is there was emotion and patriotism on both sides with the scottish referendum . 
  brits in general are not passionate or patriotic towards the eu . 
  so anyone that sticks with the status quo wont be emotionaly or patriotically motivated to vote to stay . 
  status quo people wont bother going out to vote . 
  they 'll just go with what the status quo is . 
  reporting on facebook comments , facepalm . 
  to be fair it is a funny picture . 
  and mods do n't ban me for saying its funny . 
  im an atheist and my favourite british movie is life of brian . 
  british culture has always poked fun at organised religion . 
  thats nice , but are they should n't be getting jobs before they 're offered to citizens !, 
  i call it franglais . 
  i have french family and i sometimes have to use english words when i do n't know the french . 
  a lot of english words are french anyway . 
  my french family uses english on facebook . 
  i think its partly because they have friends from around the world and its just easier for everyone . 
  foiled by the wind blowing the leaflets into the adjacent field . 
  lol i love that movie . 
  i think when kanye west runs in 2020 we can use that clip more often . 
  he says what the base of the republican party want t hear . 
  but we all know hillary will be president just by getting the female vote to vote for a female . 
  the longer this goes on the more time people get to learn about how the eu is run . 
  to get a stay vote the vote has to be done asap,
