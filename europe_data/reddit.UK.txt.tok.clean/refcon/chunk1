the article mentions long delays at customs for people coming in and out of gibraltar , do any spanish redditors know if evidence of cigarette smuggling has been found ? 
  not something i have heard about from the uk press - mind you they might not report it !, 
  also i thought there was free movement of goods between eu members - does gibraltar not count as its a british overseas territory ? 
  i am not arguing that the economic problems were cause by the euro . 
  it did however contribute both before and after the crisis . 
  were the spanish able to pursue a looser economic policy it could have helped ameliorate the tightened fiscal policy . 
  imagine the problems the uk would of have if during the recent reduction in government spending we also has higher interest rates !, 
  of course it is ** not the only reason ** . 
  things such as the flexibility of the labour market , the strength of the financial sector or the ability of the government to borrow also affect growth . 
  monetary policy , and be extension the currency used , is however still a significant contributory factor . 
  calm down son , we can disagree without becoming uncivil . 
  as i said before their economic problems were not caused by the euro . 
  however by not having control of monetary policy they have lose control of one of the most effective means to spur economic growth . 
  there are of course other policies that can be pursued to boost growth , these mostly come under fiscal ( infrastructure spending/tax cuts for example ) or supply side ( de-regulation , making it easier to set up businesses ) . 
  however a deeply indebted government can not purse expansionary fiscal policy without running into a debt crisis , nor can an unpopular government pursue supply side as they will be voted out by the interest groups they disadvantage . 
  government 's like austria had the freedom to pursue moderate fiscal policies and were able to continue their admirable investment in education . 
  countries with strong governments like poland were able to pass moderate economic supply side reforms . 
  government 's outside the eu , like the uk , were able to use monetary policy . 
  it is but one tool that can be used . 
  of course there will be a large variation of unemployment within the eurozone - after all monetary policy is but a single facet of what can be done to encourage growth . 
  what i am arguing is not that as the uk is outside it must be better . 
  what i am arguing is that as it is outside the eu it has more freedom . 
  think of it like this - would unemployment in the uk be as low as it is now were the bank of england not able to pursue quantitative easing ? 
  we of course can not know , but i cant think of an economist who would argue that the uk would have done better with tighter monetary policy . 
  i do n't argue that point , certainly their economic problems were not caused by the euro , although it certainly may have contributed . 
  that said , were they able to control their own monetary policy they would have had far more able to respond to the economic downturn . 
  the ecb was far less aggressive in dropping interest rates ( even increasing them at one point in the crisis ! ), 
  or using unconventional monetary policy . 
  a legacy of this policy can be found in the 25 % unemployment in spain , compared to 6.5 % in the uk . 
  no , however greece , spain , italy , portugal and ireland almost did . 
  oh wow , that 's very depressing from a uk point of view !, 
  thanks for the link . 
  how much was junker/presidential elections discussed in other countries ? 
  in the uk i ca n't recall it ever being mentioned , and its not like i do n't watch the news/read newspapers . 
  it was a good headline , certainly got my attention !, 
  i should clarify my point as regards to the corrupt governments . 
  in a period of low interest rates , inflation and growth governments should have used the opportunity to pursue policies that will encourage growth . 
  for instance the german 's increased the flexibility of their labour markets or poland , despite interest rates on government debt falling sharply , moderated government borrowing . 
  think of the sensible us household who paid down debt as the germans/pole and the irresponsible us households who bought to large houses are the southern europeans . 
  the goal of quantitative easing is to lower interest rates when conventional monetary policy is no longer effective . 
  it does this by increasing the supply of money , assuming the demand for money is fixed this will reduce the ` price of money ' . 
  in the case of money the price is denominated by the interest rate - the more valuable holding money as an asset is the higher the cost of not saving it ( via the forgone interest rate ) . 
  the us and uk achieved a reduction in the real interest rate through asset purchases - newly created money used to buy assets . 
  the eu has achieved the same end through these loans - by creating new money then lending it out at below market interest rates . 
  it is equally inflationary in that it creates new money , however it is impossible to target inflation to particular areas . 
  i concede your point on the relative value of currencies - do you know if there has been any academic work done on this ? 
  i.e has this been demonstrated ? 
  i would note that there are several factors which affect he relative value of currencies . 
  i genuinely do n't think that southern europe will separate from the eu , the real danger of this passed in 2011/12 . 
  i contend that we are now in the recovery period - the real danger was when it looked as through greece may default . 
  i note that the parties which seem to have seen the largest eurosceptic/anti-eu party growth are the northern nations such as france , the uk and to some extent germany !, 
  which of the nations do you see leaving the eu first , and which political parties do you think will be elected to lead them out ? 
  well to start with the economic downturn we have experainced over the past decade has been significant , possibly the biggest since the great depression . 
  however to equate this to the first world war ( 38 million dead almost entirely from europe , the collapse of the global monetary system that had lasted 100 years , the destruction of 3 empires , destructions of most of frances economic base ) , or the second world war ( much of europe in literal ruins ) is hyperbole . 
  secondly germany did not want to sacrifice the deutchmark for the euro - it was the price they paid in order for france to let them unify with east germany . 
  the germans did not want to be saddled with poorly performing southern european economies . 
  despite this they were an economic success ** only ** after wide scale social and economic reforms in the early 2000 's that significantly reduced their social safety net and kept down wages . 
  germany succeeded because they took the necessary pain early - southern europe is taking the pain now . 
  further to my last paragraph you seem to have the attitude that the nations currently undergoing austerity have not benefitted from the euro . 
  on the contrary for the first decade of the euro they saw the cost of their borrowing declined remarkably - people were willing to lend them the same money at the same rate as germany !, 
  rather than use this to finance investment and improve productivity this boon was squandered on in many countries . 
  so , i challenge your first argument that germany has profited greatly whilst the others have not . 
  your second argument that germany is destroying europe by not letting the central bank print money . 
  yet the ecb has issued trillions of euro 's in [ 3 year loans ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/28/european-central-bank-euro-eurozone ) to banks - essentially the same policy as quantitative easing , aside from the fact that the ecb does not have to fill its balance sheet with billions of euros worth of questionable assets . 
  why is inflation the fairest way to bail them out ? 
  please elaborate . 
  how does not printing money make it harder to compete with the us and japan ? 
  please elaborate . 
  finally do you think that europe is being destroyed ? 
  in what way - do you mean the european union or the peoples of europe ? 
  the top 10 ukip strawmen ( and why they are made of straw ) also the author puts his arguments in quotation marks , i suspect he ` is n't actually quoting anyone but himself ' . 
  what in the act covers what s&p have done ? 
  also any precedents ? 
  what are the ` big things ' you admire ? 
  the ottomons were one of the great powers of the world in the 15th-19th centuries , certainly on par with the major european powers until the mid 1700 's . 
  they were more developed than the byzantines towards the end in terms of organisation , i cant say i now much about the cultural output . 
  certainly the byzantines were an almost non existent power after the 4th crusade . 
  if you have an anitquarian view of history then surely turkey would be an essential part of europe !, 
  from the even before the classical age of greece ( where the very concept of europe was formulated ) there have been a huge number of greek colonies across turkey , especially the coasts . 
  up until the battle of mazikert it was under the control of the eastern roman empire ( byzantine in western history after the fall of the western empire ) , an orthodox christian , greek speaking power . 
  but for example were we to look at turkey after the rise of the ottomons and the conquest of istanbul they do n't differ greatly in development from much of eastern/southern europe . 
  other than that it is was a muslim , rather than christian , power it does n't differ greatly from the great christian european powers of spain , austria-hungary or russia . 
  if we shift our gaze to the 20th century the differences do appear , but so do similarities . 
  if i were to tell you about a highly religious country which adopted an acutely secular state , whose greatest hero of the 20th century led a military coup against the government , i could be referring to turkey , or france . 
  or how about a nation which deployed its military and intelligence forces to crush a separatist movement - turkey or the uk ? 
  in the past 20 years turkey has seen a huge increase in economic development , an expansion of universities and education . 
  this is coming from a low base but is hardly adverse to the future . 
  i have made some fairly sweeping statements in my comments , if you think i 'm wrong please try to persuade me !, 
  unless like the uk government you believe that peoples should have the right to self determination . 
  so the people do matter . 
  my apologies if i 'm being obtuse , but are you saying that gibraltar may be a colony , yet even if it is the population are not colonists ? 
  if there are no colonialists how can there be a colony ? 
  because part if spain 's argument is decolonisation , so this distinction is important . 
  if it is a colony then how else could the population be described ? 
  i disagree , but you shouldnt be downvoted . 
  off your post i have one question , at what point are people no longer colonists ? 
  because gibraltar was made british before any modern nation was founded in the americas . 
  the uk ran continual trade deficits at the height of its empire before 1914 , it all depends on what the deficit is funding . 
  if it is the provision of capital in growing industries it is good , if it is fueling consumption then less so . 
  in terms of government deficits the eu nations going into surplus would n't have that great an effect on the rest of the world .
