yeah , its another effect of the rapid drop in players really . 
  other than americans there were n't really many `` neutral '' options for alliance swings . 
  that 's the kind of scheming that will get you ahead , yeah . 
  i do n't really have it in me to betray allies though , i guess i 'm like / u/romaneseuntdomusx in that i prefer to stick with my alliance group once i 've formed it even if it is n't always ideal . 
  i think 1620-1640 was probably a decent time to betray us , we 'd just made an enemy of the ottomans and the italians were only half restored so we did n't have any easy allies . 
  but with that said , the window was pretty tight as the pope quickly recovered to decent strength while the ottomans turned out to be no significant threat . 
  i never had any plans to betray you , but i did have some measures in place if you betrayed us , though naturally they relied on prussia staying on my side - if you both betrayed me i 'd have been dead . 
  to be honest , i 'm not actually any good at scheming either !, 
  / u/dakarans handled all of my groups diplomacy when europe was still crowded - and i even fucked up some of his efforts with france . 
  the only diplomacy i really did was being nice to italians , which i agree is more fun - but certainly made me a lot weaker than if i just ate them . 
  i think if you 'd expanded into ottomans/persia/mughals earlier then you 'd definitely have made it into the top 3 . 
  unfortunately they were ai run a lot and it always feels mean to beat someone up while they 're away . 
  assuming we can get someone to host next campaign , i 'll be writing aars for all the sessions so you 'll get to see what i 'd have written !, 
  yeah , i 've read through your bit and i did n't actually state that you had persia as a protectorate , only that the central asian & tibetan warlords look to delhi not beijing . 
  i had so much to write for the asia section i guess i forgot :( on the bright side , you 're pretty much the only one other than the italians who actually comes across as a decent human being . 
  you loyally support ming even when shes losing , only intervening in china after it becomes clear ming has completely gone to hell . 
  ( which i think is pretty fair ? 
  you and ming always got on well , whereas there was that kyushu thing with japan so i can imagine him turning on ming ), 
  i 'm sorry it feels that way , i believe you 're one of the highest developments ( once you account for 75 % autonomy in african land ) , with nominal sovereignty over ming central asia and persia . 
  i 'll write your nation a bombastic intro to the next one !, 
  ( unless you pick something like navarra , i 'd struggle with that ), 
  i 'm just gon na chuck this as a reply , since this post is probably the most relevant in the thread now . 
  [ post game summary ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/4h96mk/reurope_mp_session_9_end_of_an_age_new_game/ ) as i note , its heavily dramatized to present a climax we did n't actually experience , i felt that if i just posted `` we all kind of wandered off '' we would n't get as much interest in our next game !, 
  if you were at the last session your nation will be a winner of the `` napoleonic wars '' and you should see a happy ending . 
  if you were not present , i 'm sorry but you 're a loser of the `` napoleonic wars '' and probably got treated pretty badly . 
  ( grimdark etc. ), 
  i have also included a screenshot from 1695 so you can see the actual endgame screen . 
  i had a great time playing this mp and certainly look forward to the next one !, 
  gon na be honest here , i did n't think the papal states even had an anthem . 
  bohemia looks forward to getting to know your customs and culture better . 
  his royal highness , the king-elector of bohemia ( formerly of the imperial pod\u011bbrad line ) is pleased to announce that he will be attending . 
  he would like to assure all imperial citizens and satellite states that the empire is certainly not being run by `` robots '' and any accusations that the grand-elector of hannover is `` artificial '' are unfounded . 
  regardless , please rise for the [ imperial anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjfftgpoaci ) . 
  [ post game summary ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/4gotqo/reurope_mp_session_8_pride_prejudice/ ) naturally as i was n't present most of the narrative is based on contributions from users in this thread and on steam . 
  if you feel i have misrepresented anything or got something wrong , please let me know and i 'll correct it . 
  some adjustments may be needed then . 
  yeah no worries , i did n't realize bohemia had fought quite so many people at once until you posted earlier !, 
  naturally the temporary french reconquest will be corrected immediately . 
  ( unless i have a truce < _ < ), 
  i was just curious about how all the strange stuff with bohemia occurred really , as bohemia is my nation . 
  fortunately , u/kayanrider provided some additional context which makes sense - i did n't understand how i lost a province to france and things like that . 
  your comment helped greatly , but i just wanted a little more about bohemia !, 
  i hope asia learned it 's lesson here . 
  deutschland uber alles is not just propaganda is our way of life . 
  and i wo n't forget that asia attacked in my moment of `` weakness '', 
  it 's our secret weapon - ai is ubermensch . 
   oh it did ... win two wars vs france , one war vs ottoman and whitepeaced out with the french , ottoman , ming , bharahat , japan coalition . 
  and that was without any allies !, 
  i shed a single tear for how awesome ai is . 
  pretty smart though , since other germans ca n't enforce peace on a sweden defence . 
  i 'm sure my german friends will return my crown now that ai is gone , though to be honest i think the ai might have done a better job defending europe than i ever did !, 
  i had a chat with u/pigonawing and read u/hp _ civ 's fantastic summary but . . what the fuck ? 
  germany and bohemia seems in a great place but i 'm not really clear on the details . 
  anyone want to give me some more context ? 
  it 's a bit confusing . 
  his imperial grace vaclav of bohemia regrets he will not be attending . 
  i have complete faith in my german brothers and look forward to hearing of their success . 
  sadly could n't get a sub but i 'm sure the ai wo n't do anything crazy . . 
  and this folks , is why the previously good relations between poland & lithuania ( they were even one united nation for a long time ! ), 
  no , it only achieved independence last session so it 's available . 
  it 's currently guaranteed by ming etc and is westernizing . 
  it 's in a decent spot but not much expansion singe it 's completely surrounded by bharat and ottomans . 
  [ post game summary is up !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/4f6o0e/reurope_mp_session_7_a_storm_of_vengeance/ ), 
  with the vile turk driven out of hungary and [ vienna returned to the empire ] ( https://wordwarriorsandiego.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/husaria.jpg ) , there has never been a better time to join the imperial armies and fight for christendom . 
  that whole `` counter-reformation '' thing never really took off to be fair , papists are * soo * 1444 . 
  also - rest in peace alzbeta , 63 years of glory !, 
  soon ^ tm, 
  that 's pretty cool . 
  i like that it exiles armies and stuff , seems pretty good but i 'd be worried how it 'd work with multiple wars . 
  semantics !, 
  was i about right on the events ? 
  my view from mali was pretty . . second hand . 
  i have n't really played the new patch much since this mp is still on 1.5.1 - are the winners forced to offer a peace by unconditional surrender ? 
  your celestial majesty , i am most saddened to hear you will not be able to [ attend ] ( http://imperialsm-by-brady.wikispaces.com/file/view/china_cartoon.gif/59234358/china_cartoon.gif ) . 
  i am sure that [ nothing ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/china_imperialism_cartoon.jpg ) will happen in your absence . 
  anyone got a map of china ? 
  i 've been struggling to find the mouth of the pearl river , i wanted to send a couple of ships there . . 
  that france is actually much reduced - she 's lost her last 3 wars against germany and is currently losing vs ottomans . 
  i did n't make any aars for our first sessions but if i remember correctly , burgundy and england fought each other , austria committed suicide offensive warring france & aragon got attacked by . . everyone . 
  ended up with england having to fight france/spain/sardinia-piedmont with only hamburg/tunis as his allies - they built more heavies and landed in ireland . 
  the rest was history . 
  her imperial grace alzbeta z podebrad will attend . 
  she would like to thank the german people for their perseverance during the recent [ rhine crisis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zujhohzbsg ) , your iron will is an inspiration to a europe which has long suffered under the boots of despots and heathens . 
  of course , the empire also recognizes the hardships and sacrifice endured by our italian friends - we look forward to renewing the ties of brotherhood that once made italy and germany so great . 
  [ let the eagles spread their wings !,

  i actually disagree with the fact that we get a rebate , so as far as i 'm concerned no one should have one . 
  you do n't get the biggest bill . 
  you contribute more proportional to your gni than other states . 
  i think in 2014 ( the dataset / u/bien-alleye posted below ) you were the 6th largest contributor by flat value , but highest per capita . 
  the `` item '' on display at the russian museum of erotica is almost certainly a fake . 
  even if you accept the claim that his penis was rescued by a maid and then sold to ex-lovers residing in paris - all accounts of the penis before 1994 describe a dried out organ rather than the penis preserved in fluid at the museum . 
  ( not to mention that the bonham auction house stated that the item sold in 1994 was a sea-cucumber not a penis ) additionally accounts of rasputin 's . . ah . . prowess from ex-lovers such as his supposed gay lover felix yusupov claim that his prowess came from an exceptionally large wart on the head - not present on the member here . 
  finally on a slightly tangential note , some historians such as orlando figes ( a peoples tragedy : the russian revolution 1891-1924 ) subscribe to the theory based on circumstantial evidence that rasputin was impotent . 
  the eu rebates are applied before payment , so its a reduction of uk fee 's rather than any money changing hands - as it says in the linked document .

  well . 
  i do n't know about you lads but that arianna chick can hug me . 
  that 's a fair comment and a very poor show on my part .
