  try to placate or ally poland/ottomans and you can focus on european expansion , or alternatively try to ally france/iberians and expand east instead - you 've got plenty of options but you need to move fast to stay relevant . 
  also we have no burgundy atm so inheritance is possible !, 
  to be honest i always enjoy having early rivals so i 'm pretty happy we have a mamluk player . 
  brotips : put focus on mil so i do n't get tactics advantage over you and seriously try to get some player allies early - i 'm sure there 's some europeans who 'd want to contain ottoman expansion . 
  hope i did n't sound too patronizing , i just want to make sure you do n't have a bad time !, 
  currently we have a player poland , player sweden and player muscovy so it 'd be pretty difficult as you 'd be quite surrounded by bigger players and have no natural player allies ( maybe brandenburg or possibly a temporary alliance with one of the muscovy/sweden/poland but long term those 3 would probably betray you ) . 
  if you 're interested in playing a smaller power to get used to multiplayer but have decent eu3 experience , i might recommend a berber like tunis , an african like ethiopia , an indian like vijayanagar or bahmannis or an italian like venice or savoy . 
  brotip : build a lot of heavy ships . 
  ballsy !, 
  if you really are new to the game , you 'll probably have issues with player france - i 'd probably recommend a more forgiving pick like hungary , bohemia or an itallian . 
  it 's up to you though !, 
  you 're down as england - be aware that france can declare on you in december for his cores , so get alliances fast if you want to try and maintain land in europe . 
   edit : downvotes for providing comprehensive analysis of electronic voting and proving it 's a terrible idea ? 
  awesome . 
  best way to get a downvote - complain about downvotes . 
  [ spreadsheet containing current claimed countries ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lnwee6p9tbjciuoqpcoyj1tnaznqmcze58evzp6pawo/edit?usp=sharing ) as of 6pm - i 'd love a nation to be picked in indochina and maybe 1 more in india , west africa or maghreb . 
  other nations are still available but we 're getting pretty packed in europe now . 
  can i get your mates steam name or some other identifier ? 
  so i can put him in the spreadsheet . 
  just making sure you know , there is a player ottomans ( hi it 's me ! ), 
  so if this is your first mp game that might not be a fight you want to pick - you 'll need to get some player allies fast !, 
  i 'll put you in the spreadsheet as mamluks for now though !, 
  the two differences between unconditional surrender and our rule are : * as you say , defending troops are exiled . 
  excellent solution in a 1v1 war - terrible solution in multiple wars . 
  it essentially means that when you surrender to one attacker , all attackers get a huge advantage and can advance freely to set the front-line they want while your troops are exiled . 
  * all provinces are set to occupied by the attacker . 
  frankly , since we 've never used the unconditional surrender button i have no idea how this works with multiple wars and occupations . 
  i would assume it ignores provinces occupied in other wars . 
  the idea is that surrendering to one attacker in a multiple attack scenario allows you to focus your defense on a smaller number of enemies and potentially win against the remaining attackers . 
  to give an example - if an iberian alliance and england attack france at the same time then france can surrender to the english ( losing 100 warscore of unoccupied provinces ) and then beat the iberians ( taking upto 100 warscore of occupied provinces depending on war result ) . 
  this would mean that france is net stronger than before the war and the attempt to gang him has been both punished ( net gain for france , net loss for iberians ) and rewarded ( free land for england ) . 
  if france 's armies were exiled when he surrendered to england then the iberians could position their armies in defensive postures on the french side of the pyrenees and bypass the only part of southern france that is defensible while french troops are exiled - making the war much more difficult for france . 
  do n't misunderstand , i think that the unconditional surrender button is great in 1v1s . 
  we 've just always had concerns about how it works in multiple wars , which as i 'm sure you can appreciate are pretty common in big mp games . 
  the easy one is [ british overseas territories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_overseas_territories ) . 
  particularly since we had to deploy the navy to defend the falklands fairly recently , one of the reasons for the argentine attack is often considered to be the continued naval downsizing conducted by britain in the period . 
  presenting a strong naval front can prevent nations like argentina from attacking our `` vast overseas empire '' * cough * in addition to being useful for projecting force in a hypothetical war . 
  that bastard / u/rhatkor - always ruining my nations !, 
  on a serious note , never !, 
  i 'll be spreading the true faith to vienna . 
  that 's exactly what the surrender rule is there to prevent . 
  when a nation surrenders the victor ** must ** offer them a peace - if he does n't within a reasonable time ( a few months ) then the host will pause the game and instruct him to . 
  i will claim early this time , as [ ** ottomans ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9urvjixfek ) . 
  the sons of osman will fulfill allah 's will - as set down in his hadiths :  lataftahanna al-qustantiniyya wa lani ` ma al-amiru amiruha wa lani ` ma al-jayshu dhalika al-jaysh . 
  let all those who would stand in the way of islam tremble at the sight of our horse , weep at the sight of our canon and flee at the sight of our janissaries . 
  there is no god but god !, 
  it really is . 
  sorry , i probably was n't clear - my `` different message '' comment was referring to the image not the brexit campaign . 
  well , as i 'm sure you can appreciate it 's thrown in my face every time i turn on the tv at the moment !, 
  would you say it presents a different message to you ? 
  i think this `` graph '' needs to take some account of the distance between the steps . 
  the way it is represented now , it appears to say that the difficulty of establishing the initial free trade region is comparable to the difficulty of establishing the customs union . 
  ( represented as a step of the same size on the chart ) which we all know was not the case . 
  the idea that moving from common currency etc. 
  to political union without intermediary steps is even possible is clearly sensationalized . 
  regardless of that though , representing that step within the graph as comparable to establishing common tariffs is laughable at best . 
  i can only assume this diagram is intended to make people think `` we 're close to losing sovereignty !, 
  / u/ducemon / u/hp _ civ thats all i got from last weeks thread/spreadsheet . 
  if anyone else remembers someone i forgot please page them too . 
  / u/donkeydong19 / u/worlddictator2015 / u/victosh, 
  since we did n't get a sticky i 'm gon na page some people so they know the thread is up . 
  / u/pigonawing / u/dakarans / u/m8stro feel free to downvote this post so it does n't clutter - just want to make sure everyone knows !, 
  [ spreadsheet of great powers ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lnwee6p9tbjciuoqpcoyj1tnaznqmcze58evzp6pawo/edit#gid=966539433 ) top 3 ca n't ally etc , its all in the op !, 
  i actually wrote a paragraph about personal unions and the acts of union 1707 & 1800 vis-a-vis the kingdom of england / united kingdom . 
  then i thought , before i post this i 'll refresh the page and make sure someone else has n't posted a correction first . 
  glad i did that now !, 
  you can dislike merkel - there 's plenty of reasons and a lot of people do !, 
  but if you genuinely believe she 's a dictator then you either do n't really understand what a dictator is or you are out of touch with reality . 
  [ post game summary ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/4iedry/reurope_mp_game_3_session_1_lines_in_the_sand/ ) is up !, 
  what happened ? 
  you just . . left : o fyi eastern europe ai n't changed much , lithuania won a war vs muscovy and brandenburg beat bohemia but other than that its the same , there 's plenty of viable picks if you wanted to come back . 
  the sublime porte is pleased to announce that sultan mehmed the conqueror has finally subjugated the last remnants of the roman empire . 
  as mehmed said when he saw the ruins of the boukoleon : the spider weaves the curtains in the palace of the caesars , the owl calls the watches in the towers of afrasiab . 
  how masterful and wise the sultan is . 
  also shoutout to the islamboys crimea and tunis - represent !, 
  you can take a pu of burgundy if you want , you just need to get independence within like 30 years . 
  with france and england around you could probably get some support - but you might find yourself trapped after :p, 
  surrender , i have no idea how unconditional surrender works in multiple wars ? 
  it 's supposed to set all the country as occupied and exile all your troops , how does that work if you 're fighting 3 different players ? 
  another brother in the dar-al-islam !, 
  rest assured the caliph in constantinople looks favorably upon your existence . 
  there is no conqueror but god !, 
  yeah sorry for the ninja edit !, 
  i was toying between the two . 
  ok , i think the only great powers influential in europe unclaimed are austria and ottomans . 
  with that in mind & since i 'm about to go out for the afternoon - i 'll claim ** ottomans ** changing my claim to ottos . 
  after thinking about it , austria is important but so are turks and austria would probably be too similar to my boh game . 
  nice one . 
  yeah i sent / u/czokletmuss a poke to let him know the thread was up so i 'm sure he 'll swing by and confirm . 
  dat empty asia though . 
  everyone scared of corruption ? 
  just making sure you noticed , there 's an aragon player so you 'll need to fight for independence . 
  france , with castille/aragon/portugal currently picked you 'd probably be able to find an ally against britain . 
  i 'll claim a nation once the maps a bit more crowded , see where some more player competition is needed . 
  / u/al-quti might i recommend a googledocs spreadsheet ? 
  it 'll make keeping track of nation claims easier and make it easier for people looking for a nation to know what they can take . 
  rule suggestions , they seem very similar to / u/dakarans suggestions from last session so i 'm ok with any of them , especially the pu ones . 
  getting pu 'd by an ally should n't be an excuse to expand alliance size - it should be a plan altering disaster . 
  regarding max alliance sizes , i think it might be best to work with diplo relations , that way diplo idea groups actually provide a benefit and it will mean that not everyone in an alliance can ally everyone else , giving more war opportunities .
