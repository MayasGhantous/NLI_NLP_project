  but if he is n't there when we play , you can take it for at least that session . 
  if an absentee going to be late to a session and do n't want to lose your nation please post in the weekly thread so we know you wo n't be showing up . 
  if you give notice , you can miss one whole session and still have the right to your nation when you come back . 
  ** i can only join for 3 hours , not 4 , is that fine ? 
  ** answer : then join for 3 hours and leave before 4 . 
  that 's fine  ** i came 10 minutes late and you have already started / i crashed / i got annexed and disconnected , what do ? 
  ** we will be playing with a ton of people . 
  that means we unfortunately ca n't be restarting every time someone joins or disconnects . 
  we will be having ~ 2 restarts total for everyone that came late or crashed to be able to rejoin , so it 's not the end of the world . 
  in general the first one will be around 21:15 cest ** i am bad at this game ** you are absolutely welcome !, 
  most of us were n't experienced players in the last game and we had a ton of fun with a lot of wars , plots , politics , etc. 
  ** i have never played this game before ** you are also absolutely welcome but ... you probably wo n't enjoy this . 
  the game is super complicated and you wo n't understand most things and a 20-40 player game is usually a wild west mess so that would make it even harder to understand . 
  i would personally suggest skipping this week and trying the game in sp first - and then join us once you know at least some basics . 
  it is really fun !, 
  ** my internet is trash , can i join anyway ? 
  ** sure but ... your internet probably ca n't handle it if it 's really bad . 
  if you slow down the game too much , it 's not practical to participate . 
  we need to keep a consistent speed 2 and if you ca n't handle that ... sorry . 
  if you are not sure , feel free to join and see how it goes ,

  we 're getting towards this end of this campaign as the 18th century advances and poland explodes into glorious revolution . 
  the battle lines are drawn across the globe as everyone must decide whether to stand with the reactionary absolutists of the counter-revolution , or the revolutionary dreamers who want to bring the whole edifice crashing down . 
  an age of warfare beckons as the polish revolutionary committee prepares their armies , do n't miss out !,

  this will be the final session of this campaign , the revolutionary armies of poland stand triumphant and the reactionary ancien regime 's of the west are humbled . 
  one final chance for glory awaits as the west tries to recoup their losses and the revolutionaries seek to conclude the epitaph of empire . 
  we 're very low on nations now , as you 'd expect , there may be some sub spots available but that 's it !,
