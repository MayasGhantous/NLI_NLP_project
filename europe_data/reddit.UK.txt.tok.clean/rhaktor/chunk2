  including ak as part of the polish national army is reasonable as they were affiliated with the polish government in exile . 
  even if you take the most conservative estimates of ak strength during operation tempest it would place their troop figures in the top 4 . 
  50 % sounds more like equal sharing than scraps . 
  but suit yourself , 
  ehh . . partly accurate if you narrow it down to national armies of allied belligerents and exclude comintern/axis/partisan forces . 
  its entirely possible that between june '40 and june '41 while britain and her commonwealth were the only allied belligerents in europe that the polish forces in the west were the second largest allied national army - i believe some 20-30 thousand polish troops were evacuated to england following the fall of france which is fairly substantial . 
  later in the war , the polish forces in the west capped around 250 thousand troops & the polish forces in the east were i * think * around 50 thousand . 
  though these are 1944 figures so we must account for canada , free france and america as active in europe which would solidly put poland out of the top 4 allied belligerents by army size in 44 . 
  calm down mate , no ones calling us a `` weak irrelevant shit hole '' or `` crying '' . 
  the 4th , 6th and 8th largest economies ( our peers in europe germany , france & italy respectively ) are happy to work within the context of europe . 
  they do n't think its `` beneath their stature '' because they * actually * live in the real world . 
  oh is it the past again ? 
  great !, 
  let me call the lads over , which part of the empire are we reconquering first ? 
  i think the caribbean would be a good place to start , or the ionian islands . 
  i like the sun , you know ? 
  or , you know , we could accept reality that our * peers * in europe work with us as equals , not our overlords . 
  do n't worry , i 'm not agreeing with the guy simply making sure everyone is clear on what hes saying . 
  i 'm british so i 'm not exactly going to forget the contributions of polish heroes such as the 303 squadron who are still remembered in popular culture today . 
  `` eurocrats '' handed back 4.5 billion in public sector grants ( mostly in farming industry ) to the uk in 2015 . 
  we also got a 4.8 billion rebate . 
  an additional 1.4 billion was handed back in private sector/research grants . 
  i know its not flashy or vogue to say these things but on average over 50 % of our contributions come back to the uk in addition to helping smaller economies grow . 
  sources - [ uk treasury ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/483344/eu_finances_2015_final_web_09122015.pdf#page=18 ), 
  i think that most of the confusion here stems from poor wording . 
  the scholar is n't claiming the number of jews killed by the poles is larger than the number of jews killed by the germans . 
  the scholar is claiming that the polish people killed more jewish people than they killed german people during the war . 
  [ post game summary ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/4e75xa/reurope_mp_session_6_summary_twilight_of_empires/ ) is up !, 
  well , if you both add me on [ steam ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075185979/ ) then we can discuss , i have an image as a starting point of discussion . 
  i am not inflexible , i am inviting discussion not dictating demands . 
  my empress is my waifu at this point , she 's 66 , been reigning since she was 4 . 
  62 years of glory !, 
  i have a vision for italy which i would be willing to share in a pm if you 're interested in further discussion between the interested parties ( myself , yourself and venice ) . 
  i 'll provide a brief summary before i start on my aar . 
  after the german empire white peaced piedmont and spain to focus on france , piedmont declared on you . 
  venice and ayutthaya fought to defend you , but ultimately lost . 
  you lost . . a couple of provinces , mostly colonial . 
  germany intervened in italy and significantly dismantled sardinia-piedmont , resulting in venice regaining all cores and you getting 3 provinces back , in addition to liberating switzerland . 
  after germany annulled all of frances alliances france allied you and sardinia started supporting independence of one of your colonies . 
  this led to the french occupation of savoy when your colony declared . 
  unfortunately ai ottomans declared on france and you honored the cta . 
  you are not the wargoal , and ai ottomans will likely take nothing . 
  finally , germany is once again occupying sardinia , with the intention of liberating the remaining imperial holdings . 
  sardinia has no allies and i encourage you and venice to assert yourselves at this juncture . 
  edit : [ inspirational listening when hearing about sardinia-piedmont 's collapse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p39ulifnzc ), 
  [ map ] ( http://imgur.com/kbm5fff ) in honor of the pope , i present this screenshot . 
  i 'll provide a more detailed summary tomorrow . 
  down with the french !, 
  i 'd suggest a special video , called franco-prussian war 2.0 electric boogaloo which is just a 5 hour long slow motion of german troops moving into the paris province . 
  chinese accession to the empire would be impractical , the european uni - holy roman empire could n't merge with such a large market without maintaining our tariff restrictions on certain chinese goods . 
  to protect our domestic industries , i 'm sure you understand . 
  further co-operation between the empire and china is of course welcome , we would look favorably upon assertive chinese action with regard to certain situations that may present themselves in the future . 
  i 'd worry more about him than yourself . 
  you 've got guarantees from the empire and ottomans , he has none . 
  well . 
  any such negotiations on accession to the empire would require consent from the grand-elector of hannover and the king in prussia . 
  additionally some doctrinal concessions vis-a-vis simony excetera would be needed . 
  we can discuss further after the second franco-prussian war ends . 
  1591 , eurasia is pretty much just player blobs so things are heating up , we had like 4-5 major player wars last session . 
  for a new player i 'd recommend picking a colonial nation , any ai left in eurasia is going to be in a terrible position . 
  i think caribbas and new spain are available , or papal argentina . 
  savoyard brazil was picked last game though . 
  colonial nations are your only real pick , the remaining ais on eurasia are in terrible positions and will suffer player aggression that their nations are n't able to handle . 
  her imperial grace alzbeta is encouraged to hear that the empire remains as popular in italy as it has always been , despite some issues encountered last week . 
  advise the children of venice to look up to the mountains where they might be able to see german troops marching across the alps to raze piedmont . 
  bohemia reporting in , just reminding all imperial citizens to [ keep calm ] ( http://sd.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/i/keep-calm-and-kill-the-french-2.png ) there is nothing to worry about , the momentary french occupation of landshut will soon be ending . 
  i encourage all able bodied germans to attend the [ colours ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/flag_of_the_german_empire.svg/1280px-flag_of_the_german_empire.svg.png ) and fight for the fatherland . 
  [ gott erhalt alzbeta den kaizerin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p39ulifnzc ), 
  stephen b\u00e1thory 1575 , he was a decent bloke . 
  he beat up proto-russia which is always nice for a polish king . 
  technically he was the second king to be elected after the pacta conventa/henrician articles but the first chap ran off to france after a year so he does n't really count . 
  definitely downhill from there though , the silly poles elected a swede !, 
  edit : spelling, 
  boh-barelyagreatpowerprobablyshouldntbe-emia checking in , seems legit . 
  post-game recap etc. 
  is up !, 
  i 'm sure it was . 
  we should have warned you what a terrible state muscovy was in and recommended a colonial nation really . 
  i hope it does n't put you off mp in general , it really can be a blast . 
  well , look . 
  obviously the connotations are terrible . 
  but you got ta admit its a striking design :p, 
  indeed bruder . 
  for inspirational listening i encourage all citizens of the empire to listen to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhhorz4uyk0 ) on loop until next saturday 's session . 
  it will be played as we march into paris to keep our goosesteps in perfect rhythm . 
  appreciated as always popey , though i hate your illegitimate religion i love your balls . 
  sticking it out with the pope after all this takes guts . 
  also since our archivist was n't able to come tonight , i 'll make another mini-recap tomorrow and post it here & / r/eu4, 
  he is , but that just makes him adorable . 
  there are n't enough eagles on flags these days . 
  he 's about to lose another war , so do n't worry brother . 
  deutschland uber alles , we 'll sign the peace in versailles and make the french pay for it . 
  i was bohemia , so not one of those guys . 
  but i 'd like to apologize regardless , people make plans and do n't always change them because a new player joins . 
  i 'm very sorry your experience was bad and i completely understand your annoyance , but equally muscovy is the only expansion for those players and they 're used to it being ai . 
  does n't excuse the gangbang but i hope it explains it . 
  hope you have better luck next time you play , with us or anyone else . 
  dat german eagle though . 
  10/10 would salute . 
  the great power of bohemia - has a nice ring to it .
