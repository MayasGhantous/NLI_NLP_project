  / u/chricri3112 is our observer , i do n't know if he streams but he usually makes our aar stuff . 
  hopefully he 's around and can tell you . 
  in case it was n't clear / u/blue _ leprechaun is * mughals * and allied with bharat and ming . 
  expansion opportunities include russia who he has no truce with so you can get stuck in with war right away if that 's your spice . 
  please ignore my flair < _ <, 
  her serene grace , empress alzbeta z podebrad is happy to announce she will be here to protect and serve the holy roman empire once again . 
  she would also like to stress her desire for co-operation and goodwill with all of her neighbors except those who hold her cores . 
  these are troubling times brothers of christendom - heathens from the east surge towards our island of sanity , adrift in a sea of darkness . 
  we must put our petty squabbles aside and shore up our defenses - vienna is fallen , old rus lies in ruin and hungary is a kingdom of carrion - who now can save us but luther ? 
  edit : also [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/wpmdz ) is a link for anyone new that describes the state of the world at the end of last session . 
  the definition of [ protectionist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protectionism ) :  protectionism is the economic policy of restraining trade between states ( countries ) through methods such as tariffs on imported goods so yes , putting tariffs on chinese steel is a protectionist measure . 
  please do n't misunderstand , protectionism is neither a good or bad thing - it 's simply an economic tool . 
  i kind of like it . 
  because our center conservative government does n't want to interfere with free markets and we want chinese investment . 
  a protectionist labor government might behave differently , but corbyn is more likely to become become a janitor than prime minister . 
  there 's some archivists in russia attempting to prove that orthodox church property was exempt from the sale of alaska , spruce island being the primary example . 
  it would n't hold up in court though and the church would n't try . 
  i think you 're the one missing jokes mate . 
  two bombings and a knife assault , someones probably linked details elsewhere in the thread . 
  some people say she received nerve damage to her face in the knife assault but i could n't see anything about it in a brief google . 
  she might be beautiful but her job is n't going to make her popular with certain groups , she 's the prosecutor general in the crimea which pisses off ukrainian nationalists/loyalists as well as criminals - she prosecuted some pretty high profile gang/corruption cases as well . 
  well after surviving multiple attempts on her life she probably does n't have time to mess around . 
  ridiculous . 
  its well known that the ukip party is controlled by zionist elements and the scottish/welsh/irish prefer unity with russia in the face of ever deepening international uncertainty about terrorism and migration . 
  remember , if it was n't for russian subsidies we would n't be able to sustain our domestic steel industry - and what would we do with the kent-st petersburg tunnel if we seceded ? 
  clearly you `` leave '' campaigners have no grip on reality . 
   she can handcuff me and do whatever she wants after that . 
  arrest you, 
  comrade , i wept a single marxist tear . 
  it does sound very similar to the soviet anthem , is it just different lyrics ? 
  sorry , but the book you 're referencing is a self published religious article and in no way represents scholarly material . 
  wikipedia should know better than to use it . 
  sorry but english common law only dates back to 1189 and is generally believed to be influenced by norman customary law rather than anglo-saxon law - which is why we rely on a body of precedent and case law rather than the charters and collections of anglo-saxon law . 
  in either case , neither predate christianity and indeed the church was responsible for injecting concepts of roman law ( wills , donations & ownership chiefly ) into anglo-saxon law even prior to the conquest . 
  you 'll always be a hamburger to me < 3, 
  [ in game ] ( http://imgur.com/a/wpmdz ) screenshots from after the session , with minor commentary of major events that i am aware of . 
  if i missed something i apologize , please let me know and i 'll add it in . 
  we should call it slevsigtrunk to commemorate the suffering of the noble slevsigers , who for so long have been separated from the imperial bosom . 
  that . . is disgusting . 
  we should do it to people . 
  her imperial grace alzbeta z podebrad certainly appreciates the extra big crown she gets to wear . 
  but she is 4 so she 'd probably have appreciated an icecream more . 
  sorry to hear about that , hope you 're okay buddy . 
  as / u/pigonawing says krakow is eaten . 
  but the empire has marched and many things are possible during the collapse of the lithuanian state . 
  when reading of this incomparable glory , please listen to the [ imperial anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjfftgpoaci ) that we totally did n't steal from austria ( rip ) . 
  if you need assistance learning german please talk to your nearest space marine recruiter . 
  as always , thanks for the maps !, 
  i 'll do some state of the world screenshots tomorrow too , since our archivist krakow is gone . 
  can confirm , did not survive . 
  its part of hainaut now . 
  you took a second province . 
  you 're dead to me . 
  chumps clearly !, 
  behold [ most noble czech flagship ] ( https://artdoxa-images.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/artwork/image/22584/watermark_img_5291_-_fish__ships_-_the_pride_of_the_czech_navy_-_praha.jpg ) at dock , probably after trashing the entire bharati navy in 5 minutes flat . 
  seems good , i think we can all agree the score system does n't accurately represent player power . 
  though of course kingdom of bohemia resents the discrimination against landlocked nations . 
  absolutely , a very minor group who purported to represent a broader group than they did . 
  as you probably know they were only able to sustain hostilities for 3 months , so that gives an indication of their lack of broad support considering how stretched the turkish army was at the time . 
  the much more well known gen\u00e7 incident was indeed an islamic revolt ( i believe they even stated an intent to revive the caliphate system ? ), 
  which utilized kurdish nationalism as a tool to gain support rather than a goal . 
  to be fair to this idiot , he probably heard something about the `` society for the rise of kurdistan '' and its abortive 1921 revolt . 
  naturally his comment is incredibly biased and bears little resemblance to reality , but we should always assume the best of intentions even when the person involved is being ridiculous . 
  one party violating a multilateral treaty does n't necessarily abrogate the treaty , the article you linked does n't state if the treaty is still in effect or not and i have been unable to find out one way or the other in a quick search . 
  also a technical note , the invasion was n't a violation of the treaty , resolution 573 of the council of europe & an athens court of appeal ruling in 1979 both recognize the invasion itself was legal following the guidelines of the treaty of guarantee . 
  the continued occupation & subsequent support of partition is the illegal part & the violation of the treaty . 
  is n't it more like you own the cd then i sign it while you are n't looking and you sell the cd with my signature on it ? 
  i think i 'd struggle to claim you could n't do that . 
  i 'm no expert on this kind of thing , but the walls he puts his art on belong to * someone * right ? 
  so when he puts his art on someones property he 's basically giving his art to them ( whether they want it or not ) so they can do what they want with it ? 
  `` military interventions '' are what i 'm counting . 
  in czechoslovakia 's case , as i 'm sure you know , 500,000 troops from 5 nations invaded . 
  just because only a hundred or so czechs/slovaks died does n't mean its not a war . 
  i 'm just pointing out your assertion is n't correct . 
  in fact 1945-2016 does n't work even if you exclude the balkans . 
  1871-1914 and 1815-1853 only work if you pretend the balkans are n't part of europe . 
  i ca n't wait for the ming liberation of europe . 
  just remember your little buddy bohemia ai n't got no beef - i have great respect for chinese culture , i love spending time at prague 's chinatown or `` little tokyo '' as we call it . 
  http://imgur.com/a/z2t2g that 's from the end of the session . 
  i really have no clue about america though and my knowledge of asian politics is pretty much . . none so i ca n't give any info on that . 
  can confirm , did not get eaten by hungry neighbors - ate neighbors hungrily instead !, 
   in case you do n't realize what you 've just said . 
  stay tuned for more [ heresy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/jacques-louis_david,_the_coronation_of_napoleon_edit.jpg ) coming to a papal state near you next week !, 
  are you sure it 's ok to say that your holiness ? 
  i seem to recall that france is papal controller . . : o, 
  i drew a completely accurate , serious and in no way exaggerated map of the third anglo-french war . 
  just so everyone 's aware i 've been chatting with / u/pigonawing and / u/modomario and i intend to take ** bohemia ** this game instead of mali . 
  so if you 're allied to the previously ai bohemia please check your player alliances when the game starts in case it takes you over the limit . 
  well that list contains a couple of surprises - i expected to see muscovy instead of lithuania , and venice is at 4 !, 
  my whole comment is in reference to the people saying the italians are preparing to peace out , what you 're saying is the exact reason why they * should n't * , which is what i 'm saying too . 
  i agree 100 % . 
  if they peace out now they 'll get relatively minor concessions - certainly nothing the ottomans wo n't be able to easily recover . 
  especially since the ottomans have easier/more expansion opportunities than italy . 
  all it 'd really do is piss off the ottoman player . 
  ethiopia/hejaz would also be completely crushed if italy peace out . 
  like , completely . 
  though to be fair with the italians blocking the bosphorus the ottoman/russian troops will probably crush ethiopia and co anyway . 
  no problem buddy , there 's really very little reason to know what a khazar is so i 'm not surprised you had n't heard of them before . 
  metaphors and references like these * can * be used to present antisemitism in a way that is more defensible and less likely to cause offence among those who are not familiar with the references . 
  naturally i ca n't state with certainty the gentleman 's intention when he made the comment , but that 's my read of it .
