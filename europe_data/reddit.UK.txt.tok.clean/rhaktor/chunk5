  taking control of a uk that 's already got 40k french troops in it ? 
  not fun . 
  oh well , as they say in french britain : r\u00e8gle france , france r\u00e8gne sur les ondes, 
  and so it was that the british isles fell to france . 
  despite the heroic efforts of the english people being redoubled after the supposed `` itallian intervention '' and `` turkish-portuguese intervention '' promised relief to the harrowed isles the lack of any material assistance ( aside from a herculean effort by the portuguese to assist british defenses around lothian ) meant that the shattered british economy could no longer bear the weight of occupation . 
  the british king knew that if france was able to take any land on the isles , britain would inevitably fall to france in future wars . . however without any external support and relentless french demands for capitulation there remained little choice but to accept these outrageous concessions . 
  strong british rhetoric of punishing france was ultimately not sufficient to actually win the war . 
  in a sad footnote , the french declared another war as soon as the truce was up . 
  a war that britain was unable to win . 
  despite building a fleet sufficient to keep the french at bay , british troops had so little morale that the french already on the islands crushed them easily . 
  the british surrendered in the early 1490 's and the english crown effectively ceased to exist . 
  support was to be found only in tunis during this troubled time , who were themselves forced to pay a heavy price for their loyal assistance . 
  britannia may have fallen but mark her words !, 
  if the franco-iberian union is not stopped now , foul marianne will carry the fleur-de-lys to moscow itself before she is satisfied . 
  forget your petty wars for merchant cities in germany . 
  forget the `` crusades '' called by france 's puppet pope , more concerned with his own wealth than any thought of piety . 
  unite against the franco-iberians or start learning french - the official language of londres . 
  truly the ways of the christian peoples are both disturbing and ridiculous . 
  a realm ruled by children ? 
  allah forgive us . 
  did you get de-syched and played by ai or something ? 
  if so , thats a major bummer :(, 
  naturally the mansa shares your concern for the rampant aggression of this `` ungland '' of which you speak . 
  clearly these savages to the . . north ? 
  were in the wrong and the righteous intervention of the faithful in al-andalus was required . 
  it warms the mansa 's heart to hear of such bold action from a fellow muslim , even if you have been forced to seek alliance with the infidel franks . 
  alas such pragmatism is required in these troubled times . 
  it has been some time since last we received caravans from c\u00f3rdoba , i trust that all is well within the caliphate ? 
  current wars aside of course . 
  his serene majesty mansa musa keita iii wishes to convey his appreciation for the resilience and strength of the russian people . 
  while you are rightfully \u0630\u0645\u064a or `` dhimmi '' under the ghengisid khagans his majesty the mansa must reluctantly accept that the backward central asians are unable to contain a people so strong and motivated as yourselves . 
  the mansa hopes to one day establish trade and other relations with your empire under the shared interest of butchering people . 
  the mansa also sympathizes due to the similarities of our predicaments . 
  while your time of troubles was brought on by costly foreign wars , mali has endured a period of intense internal unrest brought on by the continued decline of good islamic values in our population . 
  the mansa , naturally infallible , made the choice to annex vast swathes of neighboring kingdoms and send thousands to die in reclaiming former imperial holdings . 
  of course the population rejoiced at the opportunity to become \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0627\u0647\u062f\u064a\u0646 or `` mujahideen '' and bring the light of allah to the pagans around us . 
  coincidentally a vast majority of these `` mujahideen '' died of starvation while besieging desert fortresses . 
  the mansa made the noble choice of continuing the war with the use of additional mercenaries and ignoring the complaints of the weak peasants . 
  unfortunately the mansa was struck by treachery after the conclusion of his jihad !, 
  the subjugated animals of jolof - despite nominally accepting allah , the most merciful , rose in revolt . 
  this event signified a turning point in the history of mali . 
  either the mansa would fail to assert his authority over these dogs and mali would continue it 's centuries long decline , eventually falling to one of its former vassals such as songhai - or the mansa would stretch forth his imperial fist and crush the infidel in the name of allah , the most merciful . 
  sadly the jolofian dogmen outnumbered the imperial army . . by about 400 % . 
  while allah granted us victory eventually it took a decade of nation wracking civil war to finally assert imperial authority over the outlying regions . 
  truly there is no conqueror but god !, 
  now the mansa looks out over a destitute but proudly islamic nation , ready to raise the banner of jihad and bring true african civilization to the interior of west africa . 
  in an unrelated development which will surely have little impact on the future of africa the mansa has been informed that some strange men who refer to themselves as `` port geese '' ( yes like the bird - i do n't get it either ) have settled one of the islands of the coast of gambia . 
  yeah , i ca n't see europe from my noble african home but i heard some stuff on ts . 
  its all a bit out of context without being able to see troop counts or positions though :(, 
  the glorious mansa of mali would like to express his cordial greetings and convey his fondest wish that allah , the most merciful , will smash your face with his wroth . 
  in this scenario allah is france . 
  sweet , thanks . 
  i look forward to begging for westernization from disinterested iberians . 
  i 'd like to join if there 's still space . 
  never played multiplayer but played plenty of eu4 . 
  from what i can see the only africans are ethiopia and berbers so maybe mali if that 's acceptable ? 
  a detailed analysis of the three major regions of the ottoman empire that were under different types of colonial administration and discussion about why it meets the criteria . 
  that 's more of a / r/askhistorians thing than / r/europe though . 
  short answer : yes the ottomans used colonial administration techniques and fit all of the criteria to be considered a colonial empire . 
  [ fun gif of colonial empires !, 
  yeah , as / u/victosh says , it will likely be in september . 
  last game that we played a patch behind it was very difficult to keep our numbers up , so we 'd prefer not to . 
  also we have a bunch of guys on holiday already , and more going in august . 
  do n't worry , he has arguin !, 
  so unimportant that even he forgot about it . . 
  i 'm sure / u/czokletmuss would be proud !, 
  i have thus far been unable to get anyone willing to play these nations tonight . 
  the lateness of the game and unfamiliarity of our diplomatic situation is putting people off :(, 
  as always , whatever may come , be it storm and tempest , be it ruin and fury - the ottomans will stand by your side . 
  when the debased sons of tamerlane threatened war with the uzbek - we slaughtered them by your side . 
  when the evil japanese sought to humiliate and subjugate the world - we slaughtered them by your side . 
  when the black-hearted indians opposed you - we slaughtered them by your side . 
  when we called you to arms against the west - we slaughtered them by your side . 
  should war come again , should the worst befall the peaceful sons of islam - we shall stand by your side . 
  whoever may be arrayed against you , we shall fight them . 
  for we swore at the dawning of this age , that we would stand by you . 
  we would rather break ourselves upon the anvil of war than be found lax in our promise . 
  ello ello , just wanted to clarify : today ** will be the final session of this game ** , i 'll do my best to keep us at sufficient speed to hit 1821 but even if we hit midnight and its only 1812 or something - it ** will still be the final session of this game ** . 
  if everyone is ok with it , we can run a bit overtime to hit 1821 tonight , but whatever happens this is it , we wo n't be hosting the last couple of years next week . 
  so make the most of it !, 
  if you have any territorial ambitions , tonight is the last chance in this game to achieve them . 
  best of luck to everyone !, 
  not yet no , but we usually allow current players a few days to claim before we open general claiming . 
  or maybe a mughals written from sinkiang to novgorod ? 
  :3 you can core all of that right ? 
  i 'll give you 400 % oe per war ? 
  there 's a couple of colonies available yes !, 
  you do n't need to be loyal . 
  but if you lose the independence war you lose your nation ^ ^, 
  dont trust this guy / u/ykcin81 , he leads you to apostasy and ruin !, 
   `` equals must be treated equally , and unequals must be treated unequally . '' quote is aristotle 's view on justice . 
  i 'm thinking here about how others religions are treated on islamic countries for instance . . the jizyah ( extra tax on non-muslim ) ... jizyah was abolished by all prominent muslim states in the 19th century and currently no nation imposes it . 
  only a couple of terrorist groups have collected jizyah in the last hundred years . 
  most of the north american land you have was actually part of mexico to be fair !, 
  the extra is really only alaska and oregon country , and that little bit of mississippi . 
  this game is currently in 1762 , so we 're looking at 59 more years ( most likely 2 sessions ) . 
  there are very few nations available , but there are some colonies you could take ( french colonies in america or italian colony in new zealand ) if you wished !, 
  traditionally in germany , but in our game hes been exiled to america . 
  he 's currently mexico in all but name . 
  edit : with a german flair , i guess you knew the `` in germany '' part - did n't mean to patronize !,
