   i 'm no religious person and i do n't know the ins and outs of islam , but this seems borderline blasphemous . 
  how can a worldly leader give out the order that people be denied their place in an otherworldly realm ? 
  and why on earth do people obey that order ? 
  turkey has a `` religious affairs directorate '' ( established after the abolition of the caliphate ) to replace the traditional position of sheikh ul-islam ( comparable to an archbishop level priest ) . 
  this department is pretty big and erdogan has increased its size and influence considerably . 
  the directorate and the sheikh ul-islam it replaces are nominally in charge of issuing fatawa , this could be used to rule that the victims were undeserving of a muslim burial . 
  conceptually the sheikh ul-islam and the directorate are beholden first to god , but both offices have been plagued by `` earthly interference '' in muslim nations . 
  if there was sufficient uproar then erdogan could demand the appropriate fatawa from the directorate to legitimize the action , but it 's unlikely to be required in this case . 
  great !, 
  georgia a solid little march , with a decent forcelimit ( 30 or so ) and reasonable development ( 160 or so ) . 
  we 'll need your support in the wars to come !, 
  [ does that make you feel better ? 
  the wolfing hour is upon us . 
  you might enjoy being close to / u/jepp _ if the revolutionary tide comes crashing down . 
  i maintain a vassal for just that purpose !, 
  georgia is available for people who are n't that experienced , though / u/pokeewan played georgia last session . 
  perhaps pokee would be willing to change to tunis now that / u/casparan is going on holiday , and let you take georgia ? 
  if not then you might want to take a colony , italy , tunis and france have colonies available - unfortunately my colony is taken :(, 
  i bet, 
  * but is she real *, 
  and territories like guam , puerto rico and other tiny islands !, 
  but frankly , i could n't even point those out on a map let alone * draw * the map . 
  [ my attempt ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3gmj7c7.png ) full disclosure , i play a lot of strategy games so my knowledge of states is probably a bit above average . 
  that said , i killed 2 states , drew some cartographic abortions and forgot about alaska - so i 'm not that good . 
  oh and i made a second kansas . 
  you know . 
  because . 
  you 'll be glad to know the house of solomon was n't attacked by the ottomans . 
  we 've established our borders in india and look forward to continued peace . 
  though he 's started collecting in aden which is a bit provocative . . 
  the ottoman empire is willing to listen if the new ethiopian dynasty wants to discuss anything . 
  as far as konstantinyye is concerned we will continue to respect our existing borders with ethiopia but are unlikely to renew a direct alliance ( do n't want to go over diplo limit ) . 
  georgia is also available if you just want something to chill with , it 's a vassal though . 
  the figure of 100,000 can be reached if you count the volhynia & eastern galicia massacres together and take the highest accepted estimates . 
  i would n't be surprised to find that its the popular figure considering the contentious nature of discussions about subjects like this - but / u/ben13022 's statement of 60,000 also fits within the margin of accepted estimates of volhynia + galicia in academia . 
  sources : t. snyder , the reconstruction of nations . 
  sure , if you compare them to east africa they 're pretty rich . 
  comparing them to an empire of france/iberia/britain ? 
  not so much . 
  we 're gon na miss you buddy , enjoy your holiday !, 
  your replacement needs to be a boss , its time to go ** full napoleon ** and conquer egypt , italy , the holy roman empire ( whats left of it ) and attack russia ( role played by poland ) in the winter . 
  only ** full napoleon ** will be sufficient as i want to listen to the french anthem while writing about the french conquest of everywhere . 
  at the end of the day , he 's alive in 1717 when a lot of players are n't . 
  so regardless of any potential issues he 's done at least some things very right !, 
  the ottomans are willing to continue working with an ethiopian replacement . 
  we have never sought conquest in africa , so regardless of which dynasty rules in ethiopia we are happy to accommodate . 
  [ that ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europeplaysparadox/comments/4u219g/xpost_game_3_session_10_thread/d5m5w8g ), 
  * looks at ottomans , master and commander of a bunch of desert * * looks at france , master and commander of all of western europe * yeah , uhh , remove kebab !, 
  its fantastic fun , definitely the best way to play paradox games !, 
  i 'm sure anyone here can tell you have much deeper the game is when there is actually meaningful diplomacy and rivalries !, 
  there 's a bunch of people taking breaks over the next month or so for holidays etc , but we expect this game to run for another 3 or so sessions . 
  we 're not 100 % on whether we 'll start a new game or wait for the next eu4 patch before starting - but if we do wait then we 'll do something else in the meantime ( hoi or stellaris maybe ) we 'll be discussing when we come to the end of this game .

  no , unfortunately not . 
  you 're welcome to join and play a vassal/colony if you want to observe though !, 
  the ottoman empire ( no association with turkey or her current government ) will attend . 
  we look forward to deepening our ties with the dar-al-islam and our new friends the qing and pegu dynasties in the far east . 
  united we stand strong against the tide of imperialism !, 
  whats that ? 
  we 're imperialist bastards who subjugated half of india and conquered australia ? 
  i 'm sure that was all a misunderstanding . . we 're not imperialists at all . 
  just to prevent any confusion of people reading this comment , neo-ottomanism is n't a revanchist concept . 
  it 's about political and societal engagement with territories formerly under ottoman control ( caucuses , much of the middle east and north africa ) . 
  the adherents of neo-ottomanism ( generally ) do n't advocate conquest , the reason that its generally considered a shocking turn-around is that kemalist politics has been the norm for most of turkey 's existence - which focused on engagement with the west rather than former ottoman territories . 
   look at all the previous superpowers of the world : british empire , spanish , french , portoguese etc. 
  they always commited atrocious acts and never entered a war that wasnt in their interest that 's not really correct , i suggest you read through some history before making comments like that . 
  to give a couple of examples : british empire , accelerated its own collapse fighting ww2 because of a guarantee of polish independence - not sure what the gain is ? 
  spanish empire , ottoman-venetian wars 1-4 fought to defend/reclaim venetian holdings for christendom - not sure what the gain is ? 
  dunno , we can discuss on the sub ? 
  georgian crimea intensifies, 
  that 's a pretty good idea .

  the sultan mehmet `` shadow of god on earth '' and caliph of all islam will be on a hunting trip this weekend . 
  however the grand vizier / u/dakarans will be taking the reins of empire while we are unavailable . 
  / u/dakarans has proved himself a capable commander on the battlefields of hindustan and we have every confidence in his ability to guide and protect the dar-al-islam . 
  woe betide any who would seek to take advantage of our absence , our grand vizier will teach you humility before he grinds your face into the dust . 
  edit : also if you want me to write a summary , take some screens and send me a pm with info on what happens . 
  without knowledge i ca n't write anything . 
  its pretty quick - maybe 20s to dl everything . 
  only active during the mp , does n't give you the dlc for sp . 
  soft underbelly of europe right ? 
  1662 old boy , this game will probably run for another 4-5 sessions then we 'll be starting game 4 !, 
  update : plans fell through , so no replacement . 
  if i ca n't find someone in the next few minutes i 'll continue as ottomans today , but that 'll be my last for a while . 
  it becomes other peoples business if you need them to translate for you . 
  well like i said elsewhere , i 'm gon na be gone for 2-3 weeks at least , so a proper replacement is probably best . 
  if you want to swap to ottomans permanently though , be my guest . 
  i 've written aars for sessions i have n't attended in the past , it just depends how much information people give me . 
  as long as people give me enough info that i feel i can tell their story its no problem . 
  i 'll be happy to rejoin after i 'm back ( 2-3 weeks , couple of weekend breaks and graduation weekend ) but i think leaving ottomans as ai is gon na mess the world up - so i 'd rather have someone take them asap so they can get familiar with it . 
  hey guys , ok , just got confirmation i 'm not going to be able to come ** next week ** i * can * come this week but i 'm wanting to put it out there if anyone wants to take ottomans its pretty much available . 
  ottomans are in a great position as one of the major powers , we have some diplomatic issues but as a new player you do n't need to honor * my * commitments - you can make your own choices . 
  ottomans are stable , western , big army , great ideas etc. 
  it 's essentially the perfect nation to take if you want to have a big impact . 
  if anyone wants to consider taking ottomans just say something here and we can talk . 
  if you want to take ottomans this week too that 's fine , i 'll play a vassal or colony . 
  if its got a page on knowyourmeme its not a niche hidden thing anymore . 
  grumble grumble .
