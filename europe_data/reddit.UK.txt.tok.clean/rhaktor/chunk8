  yeah , its something i give a lot of thought to believe me !, 
  i essentially went to war in eastern europe solely to maintain some semblance of balanced power and restore muscovy to a playable state . 
  i went to war in india because of bharat 's dominance seeming certain and while i have been pressuring gujarat to expand more i do n't know how far my support will go in regard to totally conquering india . 
  regarding africa . 
  i do n't really know what a good solution is . 
  tunis is my ally and i do n't want him weak but i understand what you 're saying . 
  if it was reasonable to do so i 'd give every african guarantees against outside aggression , let you fight it out and ally the victor , but unfortunately that would n't really work as it 'd stop you fighting each other too ( or make me pay 25 prestige every few years ) . 
  if i dropped my tunisian alliance he 'd be dead to europeans in about 5 years flat too , which is not to my advantage , so really i do n't know what a good solution is :(, 
   ... i 'll try really hard to not miss a session then ... its not a threat !, 
  i 'm just saying the only reason not to eat you is because you 're a player . 
  if anything i 'm trying to reassure you i 'm not about to attack !, 
   well to be honest i 'm trying to be a nice guy too i like that . 
  i thought it was nice of you to try and help mamluks , if the europeans had been smart they would have helped mamluks too . 
   it 's a bit frustrating for tunis , because his alliance with you yeah i understand . 
  it 's an issue for ottomans too , in that i 've cut off a route of expansion by allying him and i 'm committed to helping him grow because if i do n't he 's a useless ally . 
  sadly most muslims who are n't ottomans are rather weak and any allies i make who are coreligionists will need my help to actually become useful . 
  tunis continues to piss everyone off with raiding though and if he does n't start listening to me on who 's not ok to raid things might get spicy . 
   go against the ottomans even when they are blobing out of control . 
  to be fair , if you look at development growth i actually slowed down a lot this session . 
  by allying with and actually helping tunis , bukhara and gujarat i 've cut off most of my expansion directions in favor of helping other players . 
  you should see a fairly historical ottoman decline rather than a tryhard blobfest from ottomans this game . 
  the gold mines would be fantastic , since my economy is strong inflation would be close to 0 and its free cash !, 
  currently have no plans , but if you miss some sessions i 'll probably eat ai ethiopia for the cash & gulf of aden control . 
  yeah my protection of tunis has been straining relations with some europeans its true !, 
  with regard to air though , i 've given tunis a blank cheque on west africa . 
  if he wants to conquer air i will support him , if he wants to work with air i 'll do the same . 
  there was , and i 've added him thanks !, 
  if you see anyone else missing please let me know !, 
  my bad !, 
  portugal you 're a great power i 'm sorry !, 
  yeah kilwa ... has a lot of gold . 
  the amount of gold in africa makes me want to conquer it , but i 'm trying very hard to be nice d : not that being nice has been paying off , despite all my kindness half of europe still hate me . 
  it was n't ai . 
  and i allied it . 
  more details coming in the summary , but for your illumination : you 're in a union under portugal , aragon has been reduced to 2-3 provinces by france/italians and both you and portugal have lost all your african land . 
  you 're still stronger than portugal on land but you need to get some allies , unfortunately england dishonored alliance every time you or portugal was attacked . 
  sorry about that little spat we had old boy , no hard feelings eh ? 
  i 'm concerned about the future of iberia though , hopefully you 'll be able to maintain your sovereignty :(, 
  [ spreadsheet is updated ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lnwee6p9tbjciuoqpcoyj1tnaznqmcze58evzp6pawo/edit?usp=sharing ) - summary will come tomorrow . 
  my pleasure , hope you enjoy !, 
  alright , i 'll keep transcaucasia warm for you !, 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/rhaktor/submitted/ ) is a link to semi-narrative game summaries of our previous sessions if you want to take a look at them . 
  i 'd probably recommend starting at `` war & ruin '' and then reading through to `` end of an age '' that covers / r/europe 's second mp campaign . 
  theres also 2 for the current run , `` beasts & men '' & `` a new world '' . 
  well if you ever want to play with us , you can play as one of my vassals if you want . 
  you would n't need to worry about overall strategy - just managing your armies and country !, 
  so pretty similar to the emirate of sicily then ? 
  it might be an idea to make a meta thread to discuss this kind of stuff , so we can get everyone together . 
  because poland must be kept off the map ? 
  are you sure it is n't a bit more . . islamic ? 
  depends , if we 're thinking similar time its a bit difficult , as people wo n't want to do friday because if we 're playing saturday friday is the day people will go out . 
  sunday might work , it depends how people feel about staying up late before work/college on monday . 
  if we played for say 3 hours , like 19:00 till 22:00 we could maybe do a week night . 
  also i want to be the baddies . 
  i 'd be well up for a hoi game , once i 've had a few days to get used to it . 
  whats the weather like in al-andalus this time of year ? 
  the ottoman sultan is saddened to hear his cousin the sultan of bukhara will be unable to attend . 
  rest assured that the ottoman empire extends her protection to the bukhara sultanate , for truly if your noble personage was cut - we would feel your pain . 
  [ the glorious sultan bayezid i `` the shadow of god on earth '' , son of mehmed `` the conqueror '' , by the grace of allah sultan of the ottoman empire , imperator & autokrator of the romans , caliph of all islam , shah of persia , sultan of egypt , sharif of mecca , king of serbia , king of albania , king of wallachia , bey of baluchistan , bey of haasa , bey of iraq and bey of syria will attend this session . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmjtzlbynne ) the sublime porte will continue our long standing policy of working with our brothers in islam to create a world where no muslim man must bend his knee before a christian king and where no muslim child need suffer want or hardship . 
  for how truly was it said in the shahada , there is no god but god and muhammad is his prophet . 
  let those who would defy this holy writ tremble before the coming of the dar-al-islam !, 
  as / u/dslisser says , its much slower paced . 
  the game becomes more about working with or manipulating players than about your technical ability to expand as quickly as possible . 
  it 's a very different experience !, 
  [ list of nations ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lnwee6p9tbjciuoqpcoyj1tnaznqmcze58evzp6pawo/edit?usp=sharing ) please note this means that ottomans , japan and france can not ally . 
  ( as poland will not be attending france takes his spot as a major ) . 
  nations in need of a sub : poland , bukhara , majapahit , castile, 
  [ post game summary is up ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/4lkmvz/reurope_mp_game_3_session_2_a_new_world/ ), 
  your figures were off by 5.68 g looting but even with the correction yes , time to break your ottoman alliance . 
  yeah , i 'll be double checking tomorrow . 
  i think poland might be a bit wrong from war reps or something . 
  [ spreadsheet is updated ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lnwee6p9tbjciuoqpcoyj1tnaznqmcze58evzp6pawo/edit?usp=sharing ) if poland is ai next week then france will be our 3rd major . 
  you claimed to be the opposite of a francoist . 
  you clearly are not . 
  i am not calling you a francoist , i am saying that you are not the opposite . 
  can you try actually reading what i 've said rather than attempting to argue with your imagination ? 
  that 's all very poignant but my comment is n't about that . 
  i 'm simply saying that claiming to be the opposite of francoist while calling for expulsions is ridiculous . 
  if you 're `` the opposite '' you probably should n't go around calling for expulsions . 
  yeah , they 're in a decent spot . 
  they have n't expanded but they also have 0 ae so they can expand a lot this week while others have to wait for ae to cool down . 
  i 'm glad to hear you 're up for it !, 
  go with god brother , may your enemies scatter before you . 
  i prefer the other translation of that quote though , as it includes the excellent phrase :  to treat their beautiful queens and concubines as pajamas and pillows we turks remember how to treat people as pillows but we look forward to a demonstration by your warriors in samarkand of how one can treat a queen as pajamas without killing her . 
  sounds like your typical medieval ruler !, 
  i 'm different of course < _ <, 
  that is a pretty sick title . 
  i will definitely use that !, 
  please correct me if i 'm wrong , but i believe the ottoman sultans were given the sword and mantle of muhammad by the last abbasid caliph when they annexed the mamluk sultanate , which i 've pretty much already done in game so i figured it 'd be ok to call myself caliph . 
  u wot m8 am i doing it right ? 
  that sounds ominous ? 
  [ gott erhalte franz den kaiser ] ( http://imgur.com/a/cmi01 ) if you want to win the coalition war , best bet is to convince hungary to actually fight . 
  if you just want peace then talk to polish player . 
  nearby players : hungary , bohemia , venice , bavaria , switzerland , savoy , burgundy , brandenburg , poland , ottomans , france . 
  [ mehmed the conqueror , sultan of the ottoman turks , emperor of the romans & caliph of all islam will be in attendance .
