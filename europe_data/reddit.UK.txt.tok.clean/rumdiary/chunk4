  i sometimes wonder whether things like this are driven by islamaphobia . 
  but i recently came back from morocco , a muslim nation , and [ they 're trying to ban the burqa as well ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/12/morocco-bans-sale-production-burka/ ) . 
  for this reason my stance has changed to : it 's definitely anti-women 's - rights , so fuck it , i do n't care if it goes . 
  roger that, 
  mass media institutions should be shut down if they show bias , it directly undermines democracy by misinforming . 
  and that , of course , is the point . 
  true , but so did an 11 page long persuasion section in one of britain 's most popular tabloids * the daily mail *, 
  i still contend that any country with as much right-wing-propaganda as ours would be full of enough suckers to vote for brexit [ `` see some of us are wise / / and some of us are suckers / / but we all bleed red / even racist motherfuckers '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iypqvx49m8k ), 
  okay so there 's approx 2.7 m muslims in the uk according to google according to [ this thing ] ( https://www.mcb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mcbcensusreport_2015.pdf ) there 's 318,000 between the ages of 0-4 . 
  there are 8544 hours in a year . 
  so 1 in 37 experience fgm . 
  shit i guess that is technically plausible . 
  i thought the numbers would call bullshit . 
  sure , i 'll give you that . 
  i do n't like it , but sure, 
  the us is almost fascist anyway , why is that so hard to believe ? 
  nice one , good find, 
  stratfor ceo david sikora has a blog where i remember reading ( ca n't find the link ) that wars in syria , iraq and afghanistan were extra great for the united states because the immigration and refugees pushed europe further to the right wing . 
  edit : americans out of nowhere !, 
  almost doubling ? 
  the # pound has almost halved in value, 
  which is exactly what you 're doing . 
  i however have provided fucking sources . 
  find me evidence they do n't . 
  http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/breakout/11-billion-fine-just-cost-doing-business-jpmorgan-175948500.html http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/business/dealbook/guilty-pleas-and-heavy-fines-seem-to-be-cost-of-business-for-wall-st.html?_r=0 http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/barclays-hit-with-record-fine-as-six-banks-settle-forex-scandal-10265665.html http://www.bankingexchange.com/blogs-3/talking-credit/item/4817-fines-and-penalties-shouldn-t-be-a-cost-of-doing-business http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-2589767/total-fines-imposed-us-regulators-banks-financial-crisis-hits-100billion-half-handed-year.html the big question in my mind is - why is / u/urz _ defending a fucking bank ?!, 
  for the sake of clarity ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  it 's better than nothing , but it 's not deterring banks from doing it again if i stole # 1000 from someone and they fined me # 100 for doing it , that 's a profit . 
  let me google that for you . 
  here 's an article : http://moneymorning.com/2015/05/20/fines-are-a-cost-of-doing-business-for-big-banks/, 
  banks see fines as a necessary cost for doing business . 
  if they profit more than they lose from interest rate rigging , which they do , then it 's still an overall profit and not a deterrent from doing it again . 
  your mom !, 
  a year :d, 
  roughly # 1500 is my 30 minute tube commute . 
  it sucks !, 
  edit : me and my wife have a combined income of roughly # 75k and barely save a penny !, 
  and we 're paying less than that euro average in rent per month ( converted for gbp ) as well !, 
  [ you ca n't just make stuff up to win an argument ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioeaisweogg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=8m47s ) i hate russell brand but seriously [ if you 're going to make stuff up , go mental ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnvaqrapjqu ) , do n't specifically tell me things about me that you ca n't possibly know haha, 
  yeah i 'll keep worrying about my terminology while the state trashes our human rights lol, 
  pretty much yep, 
  tell me one facet of society that would n't be improved if news corp were gone . 
  i 'll call those cowards what i damn well like . 
  it 's owned by the same fascists, 
  thx !, 
   ecuador severed assange 's internet connection at the embassy during the campaign over fears he was using it to influence the election . 
  is that true ? 
  wtf is rafale ? 
  correct, 
  `` good luck with that '' - nato, 
  dead if true, 
  einstein , van gogh , james joyce , shakespeare , picasso, 
  it 's a double-edged sword i think that globalisation is great because i love the diversity of life and the career opportunities that exist . 
  i also think that globalisation is terrible because unaccountable corporate tyrannies are usurping sovereign power and destroying human rights and the environment . 
  fuck it i 'm tapping out , someone else take the reigns i 'm too tired and hungover today, 
  first answer me a question : have you ever been on a porn site ? 
  whoever says that needs their head examining, 
  damn i did n't even know legoland windsor existed, 
  there 's actually been hundreds of drone strikes in pakistan also i 'm guessing you 've never investigated the humanitarian crisis engineered by the united states in east timor , indonesia , with the help of the suharto regime ? 
  also why are n't you interested in the 500,000 dead iraqi civilians ? 
  or afghanistan ? 
  the list is extremely long and i 'm supposed to be at work right now ... it 's up to you to google this shit . 
   how many of them are commonly violent against people of other religions ? 
  there 's this place called israel ...  irrelevant . 
  i would argue that most muslim immigration happens because of the wars our taxes pay for . 
  which is also the primary cause of terrorism . 
  it 's better to look at the causes of problems than just stamp-out the symptoms . 
  orthodox jewish people have never integrated themselves into british society either , and their religion holds the exact same beliefs about non-believers . 
  i do n't have a problem with that , do you ? 
  i still personally maintain that religion is n't all that great in general though . 
   anti-muslim sentiment is fostered by some of the most corrupt wealthy people in the world in order to push foreign policy desires based on greed , regardless of the suffering and death of millions of innocent civilians . 
  it 's also this same factor that is the primary cause of terrorism . 
  to double-down on this bit - how much muslim immigration is as a result of foreign wars of greed , paid for by our taxes , i wonder ? 
  i 'll do my best ... 99 % of immigrants are n't like this . 
  muslim laws and cultural norms are n't likely to gain any traction in british life . 
  if they did there would be an extreme reaction against it , even from filthy leftist hippies like me many immigrants are my personal friends , maybe you 'd have a different pov if you had some immigrant , specifically muslim , friends and realized tarring them all with the same brush is part of the same problem . 
  religion is a haven for extremists and is just another tool for division regardless of which religion . 
  anti-muslim sentiment is fostered by some of the most corrupt wealthy people in the world in order to push foreign policy desires based on greed , regardless of the suffering and death of millions of innocent civilians . 
  it 's also this same factor that is the primary * cause of terrorism * . 
  i struggle to find things i hate more than tories, 
  `` weirdly normal '' like tim henman the tennis player lol, 
  pfft i was at war with the aztecs for 4000 years on a civ 3 game once, 
  if you saw someone push a disabled person in a wheelchair down a flight of stairs , would you feel sorry for the person who pushed them ? 
  now imagine you 're in charge of roughly 100,000 wheelchairs ... 
  `` bring back nigel '' - rupert murdoch `` yes , master '' - tories, 
  that was where my parents live , and they voted for snp , both of them haha, 
   first of all , do you do something what can be held against you rest of your life ? 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 i 'm just telling about the policy lol, 
  dude dude ... dude :( it 's called `` internet censorship '' , but it 's more like `` draconian control of everything you do online , logged and held against you for the rest of your life '' also it 's an absolute disaster for tech companies . 
  to be completely honest the stuff theresa may outlined does n't even worry me because it 's so outlandish i am absolutely sure it wont get passed . 
  can confirm : - work in it !, 
  in a vacuum , yes , for the good of them and everyone around them . 
  in reality , no , because it gives wealthier , more powerful interests who control our democracy the excuse to do the same and they would use that power to eradicate all traces of human rights . 
  i 'm not going to argue with you , i do n't have the time . 
  based on 15 years of reading and studying and researching and throughout my years as an activist , i feel at some point you have to stand up for what you believe in with confidence and be open and honest about where you stand and why . 
  do you support a party that gets its power from endless hours and lives of people power ? 
  or do you support the party with a handful of massively wealthy corporate donors and continue to erode basic human rights ? 
  voting tory is a vote for your own oppression , and everyone else 's . 
  that 's why so many people are afraid to even admit it . 
  everyone , including conservative voters , will have to suffer for their ignorance by living in a society with spiralling crime and inequality ?
