  find me one instance in the last 7 years of tory rule where they chose to uphold human rights instead of corporate profits . 
  you vote for a party that has n't introduced child labour * yet * because it 's political suicide , but all evidence suggests they would if they could , then you 've forfeited your right to be treated with respect . 
  voting conservative is behaviour that should be stigmatised and punished, 
  maggie 's burning somewhere in hell comforted by all those short term profits she brought to big corporations, 
  shameful, 
  unfortunately we have first past the post ensuring unhappiness prevails, 
  it 's nhs referendum day, 
  it 's not irrelevant but it does provide an important insight to accompany your facts . 
  unless you do have an opinion afterall ? 
  extra government surveillance/power has led to the arrest of human rights activists in the past , not the detection/prevention of terrorism . 
  in some ways , she is behind it selling # 3bn of weapons to saudi arabia , the main suppliers of isis decimating the police force by cutting tens of thousands of jobs but there 's a lot of stupid people in the uk , they will still vote for her, 
  profits  people, 
  there 's always a method for skirting security protocols . 
  even if these ridiculous proposals are carried out , if someone wants to find like-minded psychopaths they will find a way of achieving it . 
  you drive them underground they become harder to find . 
  funny , all those uk newspapers i saw declaring the inevitable rise of the front national and their `` dominance '' ( 21 % compared to melenchon 's 19 % ) , and yet now they are n't reporting on fn 's miniscule representation in this election . 
  it 's almost as if the newspapers are run by unscrupulous fascist billionaires with insidious agendas . 
  my jizz would fly through the air to romania and fertilise your beautiful garden my eurobro < 3, 
  relevant : [ when nigel farage met julian assange ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/23/when-nigel-farage-met-julian-assange ) personally i am looking forward to seeing this investigation extend to rupert murdoch . 
   why do you all place the cut-off point after 9/11 ? 
  i do n't . 
  you just made that up all by yourself based on assumptions that were generated by your imagination . 
  here are some pre 9/11 examples of western terrorism for you to scoff at and likely ignore : [ american missile strike in 1988 deliberately targets a civilian passenger flight killing 290 people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_air_flight_655 ) [ the united states continued funding saddam hussein whilst knowing he was gassing thousands of his own people , continued to supply hussein with weapons afterwards ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/26/exclusive-cia-files-prove-america-helped-saddam-as-he-gassed-iran/ ) [ the united states dropped more bombs on the country of laos in the 1960s than were dropped during all the allies during wwii ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37286520 ) and america was n't even at war with laos . 
  [ the united states knowingly aided indonesia in their genocide of the people of timor ] ( https://chomsky.info/19990826/ ) causing hundreds of thousands of deaths . 
  [ the united kingdom and united states overthrew the democratically elected prime minister of iran in 1953 and replaced him with a monarch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_iranian_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat )  i did n't see anyone rush to breivik 's defense to state `` well , he felt worried about left wing prominence in government and saw no other way , so the best way to prevent these attacks is to empower the right wing '' anybody rushing to a mass murderers defense is part of the problem . 
  that 's not what i 'm doing . 
  for the second time you 've assumed i 'm defending the terrorists themselves , that 's not what i 'm doing . 
  what i 'm saying is that our foreign policy serves as motivation to those who would be terrorists . 
  curtailing our overseas illegal wars of aggression , reducing drone strikes that have a 98 % civilian murder-rate , would drastically reduce the motivation of terrorists , it seems fairly obvious to me . 
  put yourself in their shoes : let 's assume you 're at a hypothetical mate 's wedding and a series of rockets kills everyone except for you . 
  kills your wife and children and everyone you know . 
  those rockets came from a drone operated by iceland or something , i dunno . 
  what do you suppose is a reasonable response to that happening ? 
  now before you get ahead of yourself again remember - i 'm not saying you would definitely dedicate yourself to becoming a terrorist if a hypothetical icelandic drone strike killed everyone you knew . 
  what i 'm saying is that your likelihood of becoming a terrorist and dedicating your entire life to travelling to iceland and committing an act of terror has just vastly increased . 
  i 'll leave you with this : [ david cameron : britain less safe because of iraq war ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/britain-less-safe-because-of-iraq-war-says-cameron-429223.html ) now go about your day and ignore everything i just wrote . 
  not in the religious sense . 
  `` faith in one another '' is a better way to put it . 
  1 month stop forgetting !, 
  i dunno if the tories are centre-right any more , since they absorbed ukip . 
  they seem to be jumping aboard the trump train to extremism in many ways . 
  i got kinda [ ripped to shreds by reddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6d7uw5/majority_of_britons_think_minorities_threaten_uk/di0qz7e/ ) for expressing these same opinions yesterday . 
  i guess it makes sense that i 'm voting for corbyn !, 
  never forget, 
  corbyn \u2260 blair corbyn 's integrity has seen his party battle from 21 % down in the polls , 4 weeks ago when theresa may called an election she thought would be easy , all the way only to a 5 % deficit with two weeks to go , which is on pace to eclipse the easily debaseable lies of the extreme-right-wing conservative party . 
  i ca n't wait for a fairer society , with policies and decisions based upon empathy and faith instead of the greed and fear of cowards who are too stupid to embrace any other policy other than to lash out . 
  i 'll be out canvassing next week , doing my bit not just for myself but for all the people around me , even those who are n't intelligent enough to know it 's for their own good . 
  you have some fair points there , although they obviously do not apply to all muslims . 
  i would be interested to see how many they do apply to since i do n't think that analysis would be true of really any of the muslim friends i have , or those from a muslim background who are n't bothered with religion any more . 
  maybe since i know plenty of muslims i 'm not so stressed as other people ? 
  a good friend i have at work is from iran . 
  he 's a cancer researcher and a great classical guitarist and he also shares my opinion that all religion is a source of division and is an outdated mode of thinking , he is not muslim although he comes from iran , in fact he refuses to go back in order to avoid military service . 
  he definitely does not deserve to be lumped in with extremists . 
  he 's one of the most thoughtful and intelligent people i know . 
  in a speech from yesterday the leader of the uk 's opposition party echoed my exact sentiments : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40053427, 
  a sense of proportion comes from a sober analysis of cause and effect , not a knee-jerk , simplistic reaction based on fear and without historical perspective .

  notsureifserious.jpg jeremy corbyn echoed my exact sentiments today . 
  my sentiments were echoed by jeremy corbyn today . 
   letting parrallels societies flourish is exactly one lesson of history where we know it did n't go well . 
  the british jewish community has done exactly that for time immemorial . 
  they 've probably `` integrated '' less than the muslim community . 
  there are n't any morons spouting shit about the jewish community though because the mass media have n't whipped them into a frenzy about it , although granted it 's obviously not jewish people who are committing major acts of terrorism of course . 
  as i 've said elsewhere in this thread i think the terrorist threat from muslims , and immigration from muslim nations , would be vastly reduced if the uk stopped bombing muslim nations and stopped bankrolling muslim nation dictators and that exact sentiment is being echoed by jeremy corbyn today : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40053427, 
  / u/unskialz opted for * none at all * it 's not effective, 
  apologies you 're correct , i was getting wound up by a lot of nasty comments on here but yours was not one of them , and i went and responded to a decent comment with outright aggression . 
  it was unwarranted . 
  i think you 've just surrendered your right to a reply my boy . 
  and it 's not because i do n't have an answer for you , it 's because you 're behaving like a cunt . 
  like i said to someone else  global intelligence firm , stratfor , [ writes ] ( https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/europe-not-just-migrant-crisis ) that the crisis in syria , for one instance , was born of a conflict of interests trying to control syria ( american & european vs russian ) . 
   it 's not just my opinion , it 's an objective fact backed up by an american funded intelligence firm . 
  but does the factual article of a billion dollar intelligence firm make a difference to you ? 
   yes , these terrorists are actually freedom fighters killing the 8-yo crusaders of the west . 
  do you honestly believe that 's what i meant ? 
   there goes your `` stop bombing isis '' - rhetoric . 
  global intelligence firm , stratfor , [ writes ] ( https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/europe-not-just-migrant-crisis ) that the crisis in syria , for one instance , was born of a conflict of interests trying to control syria ( american & european vs russian ) . 
  it 's not just my opinion , it 's an objective fact backed up by an american funded intelligence firm whose articles have far more clout than that patronising wankfest of a reply you just gave . 
  in my best yoda : the fuck up , / u/a7 _ audobon should shut, 
   have n't you heard guys ? 
  we have to accept homegrown terrorism because of foreign policy !, 
  if your aim is to intentionally distort what i just wrote , you have succeeded . 
  could you be more specific ? 
   have you considered there are new lessons to learn , as well as the old ? 
  the one major thing i have learned as a fact : mass immigration and instances of domestic terrorism both occur primarily because uk / * western * taxes pay to 1 ) bomb muslim nations and 2 ) bankroll dictators in muslim nations . 
  to drastically reduce both mass immigration and the possibility of terrorism , i suggest we stop turning muslim nations into bomb craters in wars that the united nations have called [ illegal wars of aggression ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legality_of_the_iraq_war#war_of_aggression ) . 
  this is something we can control as citizens but unfortunately it requires work and * the ability to be critical of our own actions * . 
  i make sure i go to at least one protest a year and write to my mp every now and again . 
  what insights do you have to share ? 
  or none at all ? 
  20 years ago if you saw an anti-immigrant story in the newspaper , that newspaper would be reprimanded for forgetting the lessons of history . 
  everybody around me in those days seemed to know that scapegoating immigrants was the no. 1 establishment tactic for pushing a country further to the extreme-right-wing and destroying human rights . 
  [ makes me sick how far we have fallen ] ( https://youtu.be/1wmgghleaga?t=3m34s ), 
  is it not correct though that corbyn 's left-wing policies are more in line with germany and scandinavia than , for instance , the united states which theresa may is following ? 
  what would you class them as ? 
  i 'm genuinely interested , perfectly willing to admit i 'm wrong, 
  corbyn represents ideals close to the socialist democracies of germany and scandinavia . 
  socialist democracies are the strongest , most efficient economies in the world and also present the best living standards for their people . 
  we can see those standards , both social and economic , declining with the rise of of the right-wing and inequality in the uk . 
  what 's so naive and/or idealistic ? 
  i do n't get it .
