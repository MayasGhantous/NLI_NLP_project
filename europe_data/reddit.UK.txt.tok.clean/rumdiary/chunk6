  in fact maybe i understand better than others : socialist democracies do n't enrich the 1 % as much as others . 
  the 1 % own most of the mass media . 
  mum i 'll give you chaucer , but only because i grew up in canterbury, 
  colour :p, 
  le pen somehow sneaks into the job of translator and creates havok, 
  what are now considered extremist left-wing governments built the nhs and free education here in the uk . 
  extremist right-wing governments extolled the virtues of child labour .

  prego, 
  seems quite obvious to everyone else in this thread that you 're confusing the selfless philanthropy of the disenfranchised with the malevolent propaganda efforts of nazis . 
  i do n't have the time to get as in-depth as others have but i thought i 'd add my fuel to the fire . 
  stupid comment is stupid, 
  agreed . 
  what i 'm hoping is that , if things get really bad , scotland may finally leave this abusive relationship . 
  my parents live in scotland . 
  i 'd move there !, 
  can you imagine the crime that 's going to accompany privatised healthcare ? 
  fuck that shit . 
  ( i 'll copy and paste what i just replied to someone else with ) example # 1 : nhs access to free healthcare regardless of your income * should be * a universal human right . 
  free healthcare is the norm for almost all of the `` developed '' world . 
  health is one of the cornerstones of every country 's `` success '' . 
  the united states is one of the only exceptions and it costs [ an average of usd$ 10,000 to give birth to a baby ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31052665 ) in the united states . 
  speaking from personal experience a friend of mine left the united states because it was costing them gbp # 400 a month for insulin , because the insulin was sold for the purposes of making a company a profit . 
  other companies have monopolised certain drugs for certain treatments and price-hiked over 1000 % for profit because good people like you and me * need * these to function . 
  i would argue that destroying universal health care , especially in exchange for personally enriching yourself , is an abuse of human rights . 
  but have the tories personally enriched themselves as well ? 
  jeremy hunt is the health secretary is [ already presiding over the privatisation of the nhs ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jun/30/health.politics?cmp=share_btn_fb ) . 
  this will make companies like bupa even more wealthy than they current are . 
  jeremy hunt 's cousin is director of bupa , her name is virginia bottomley . 
  jeremy hunt 's father was chairman of two private healthcare trusts before retirement . 
  proof needs to be found that jeremy hunt will personally profit from privatising the nhs , but his intimate ties to private healthcare gives you a stab in the right direction . 
  and that 's just healthcare . 
  before tories , were food banks even a thing ? 
  the list is endless .

   name me one instance when the tories have n't trampled on human rights when an opportunity to make profits for big companies existed instead , one which was n't political suicide ( they have n't ushered in child labour yet ) . 
  edit : or just downvote, 
  name me one instance when the tories have n't trampled on human rights when an opportunity to make profits for big companies existed instead , one which was n't political suicide ( they have n't ushered in child labour * yet * ) . 
  it is a good citizen 's duty to hate and defy tories . 
  exactly the kinda shit i 'm worried about how people vote tory and sleep at night is beyond me, 
  what a tory * says * and what a tory * does * are frequently different things . 
  is a ruling like this more or less likely to happen somewhere like the united state or post-brexit uk ? 
  i want to keep it that way though , 
  time to look into that eu citizenship thing, 
  apologies for all caps , that 's just how it copied across : [ `` theresa may opposed the introduction of workers ' rights she 's now promising to protect '' ] ( https://politicalscrapbook.net/2017/05/theresa-may-opposed-the-introduction-of-workers-rights-shes-now-promising-to-protect/#more-63734 ), 
  fair enough , good points . 
  i hope the overton windows moves towards democratic socialism for my sake then . 
  i like democratic socialism because objectively it seems like that 's what creates the strongest most efficient economies and all the best indicators of social justice and standards of living . 
  socialist labour created the nhs and free education whilst the establishment was weak after the war . 
  in fact i see most of the other movements ( neo-liberal , conservative etc. ), 
  as merely different ways that big-businesses/wealthy people have corrupted the natural trend towards socialist democracy . 
  the blairite * faction * within the labour party is well known for being neo-liberal , not socialist , right ? 
  she was referring to accomplishing the feat of moving labour to the centre , away from the left wing . 
  he also privatised a ton of stuff to enrich the 1 % , started the war in iraq and is described , by margaret thatcher , as her `` greatest accomplishment '' . 
  i would regard tony blair as centre-right-wing in action , centre-left-wing in words . 
  2 years, 
  i always vote left , it 's the historically proven correct-thing-to-do . 
  this is the most baldfaced lie i can ever remember seeing . 
  if the tories benefit workers rights i will be absolutely amazed . 
  there 's a place under the railway tracks at alexanderplatz which sells kebab meat inside crispy-outside , soft-inside breaded shells that are gigantic . 
  i scheduled every day i spent in berlin around returning to that shop to buy more , it was that good . 
  in croatia it was like 50p for a litre in some places < 3, 
  find me one human right the tories have protected when an opportunity to profit existed instead , an opportunity to enrich one of the people who payroll the tories . 
  i 'm talking about things that would n't be political suicide if they introduced it , like they have n't made child labour legal yet but they would if they could . 
  find me one example , you wont be able to do so . 
  for instance ; to me it 's fairly obvious that , after starting to privatise the nhs , jeremy hunt will be rewarded with a directorship at bupa or some other private healthcare firm who profits from his legalized theft from the british people of a service integral to the functioning of a fair and decent democracy . 
  virginia bottomley is director of bupa - she 's jeremy hunt 's cousin . 
  jeremy hunt 's father was chairman of two private healthcare trusts . 
  etc.etc.etc.etc . 
  if nothing else the tories are now super-extreme-far-right after amalgamating ukip . 
  tories rely on a [ rigged media system ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9lmqefvugg ) and i would personally feel embarrassed to support them since [ '' ... findings from these studies demonstrate that those with lower mental abilities are more likely to endorse right-wing authoritarian belief systems '' ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b4c3ioc2zkpqz01hdw9tumdadee/view ), 
  the way tories announce a lesser of two evils and then push for the worse one later ... maybe they 'll soon be hunting peasants ? 
  i love the top hat vs the beret on the end panel the cup of tea vs the red wine, 
  maybe gandhi was correct in saying the world should be divided up into endless cantons , 
  i suppose proportional representation means that , even if your party does n't win , your views are at least represented if you vote for it . 
  arguably the swiss participatory democracy is the best system , but alas it 's sorta limited to countries of a maximum of a few million people ... although would still probably work better than fptp . 
  in defense of fptp - it gives us a very specific human being who represents the certain area where you 're voting who you can physically visit and talk to if you arrange it ( although that 's not true for a lot of mps ) . 
  but on a macro-scale it 's absolutely awful at shielding a democracy from the corrupting forces of modern ultra-capitalism . 
  at least that 's my take on it , you 'll find other people with more input . 
  first past the post traditionally gave us two extremes : far-right tories or far-left labour so the majority of centrists end up feeling disenfranchised and pissed off . 
  thatcher 's * `` greatest achievement '' * , tony blair , shifted labour to the centre whilst the tories went further into the right-wing , especially so in recent years as the tories have amalgamated ukip 's fascism . 
  either way you get huge numbers of disenfranchised people and when something like a brexit vote occurs , when a vote tends to matter lot more than usual , you get a protest vote at the system which is not really in anybody 's interest . 
  especially when the far-left and centrists are now genuinely disenfranchised whilst the far-right are simultaneously being goaded into * feeling * disenfranchised by extremist-far-right mass media . 
  as an englishman i pine for the eu because its stronger democratic systems and less-biased media institutions stand up much better against the corrupting influences of excessive capitalism which lead to fascism and societal decay . 
  could you be more specific ?
