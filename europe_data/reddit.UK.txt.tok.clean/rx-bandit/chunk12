  then yesterday , farage had the fucking audacity to go out on the thames with fishermen to decry the damage the eu has done to them when he personally failed to represent and fight for them . 
  [ that was more in reference to the information confirmed in the leaked clinton emails ] ( http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2016/01/06/new-hillary-emails-reveal-true-motive-for-libya-intervention/ ) . 
  the americans , especially , had operatives on the ground the moment protests started in libya and began giving out small munitions . 
  they then backed opposition forces that they knew were associated with extremist salafi groups like al qaeda that were accused of war crimes from early stages . 
  it 's just another example of `` the ends justify the means '' , the ends being the removal of gaddafi . 
  american intrigue removed gaddafi and allowed daesh groups the room to expand . 
  i 'd say libya is a pretty big fuck up . 
  their state entirely collapsed and saw warlords rise up . 
  they have some rule of law now , but did n't their pm get kidnapped last year ? 
  and they also have a problem with daesh affiliates in the country . 
  granted , that cluster fuck was greatly helped by american and french involvement though . 
  yeah exactly , 100 years ago most of the arab peninsula was not developed in the slightest . 
  many were still nomadic . 
  their wealth has appeared very rapidly , thanks to oil , and they have not developed along a natural progression like much of the west did . 
  the need for four male witnesses , from what i have read , is because they treat crimes like adultery very seriously . 
  the requirements to prove adultery has happened are either non-forced confessions from the male and female or 4 male witnesses who observed the penetration ( i think some states now allow forensics and police to stand as one of these witnesses but i 'm not sure on that ) . 
  the legal requirement is so high to ensure that only the truly guilty , ie beyond doubt , are given hadd punishments . 
  i believe in the ottoman empire hadd punishment was rarely given out . 
  there is some what sensible reasoning behind it , but it is seriously flawed as we often see here . 
  if a woman gets raped and accuses a man of it , she 'll never have the four witnesses to prove she was raped and so will be given 80 lashes instead because no man is going to confess when he knows he jutmst has to shut up and the state will let it pass . 
  it would be the same if a man accused a woman of raping him and could n't prove it . 
  he would get 80 lashes and she 'd get off scot free . 
  but we all know rape of a male is rarely reported , even in the west , so i 'd be surprised if it has ever happened in a sharia run state . 
  as others have pointed out , many moroccans are second or third generation and may not have ever even been to morocco . 
  how can you deport someone to a country they 've never been to , and may not even have a passport for ? 
  hell , i 'm a second generation algerian in the uk and have never been and do n't have an algerian passport . 
   the very few muslims among the immigrants were converted to christianity when they arrived in the netherlands . 
  like we should do with the refugees now . 
  and i 'm sure you 'd have a problem with muslims who want to convert everyone to islam . 
  the hypocrisy is pretty ridiculous . 
  most modern islamic terrorists attack purely for terror , not because they think an attack will actually change policy . 
  does that mean theyre not terrorists ? 
  isis do n't give a shit about sweden changing their policy to be nicer to muslims . 
  if anything they 'd like to see them tougher on muslims and persecute them . 
  what did the guys who attacked the jewish shop want to change politically ? 
  or the train attack in belgium ? 
  or the axe attack in germany ? 
  or any other attack ? 
  what did they want to change politically ? 
  oh shit you replied in 30 seconds and entirely ignored the rest of my comment explaining how you were wrong and it 's far more nuanced and complicated . 
  but no , let 's just focus on one bit at the end . 
  it 's not like the issue of radicalisation terrorism requires nuanced , well thought out views that must come to a pragmatic solution . 
  no , let 's just fucking rave about how shit islam is and fart about like a fucking idiot and make sure every muslim who could be radicalised knows we hate them . 
  that 'll do some good wo n't it ? 
  what do you propose then ? 
  have you thought of any good ways to deal with the issue ? 
  kill them all ? 
  deport them ? 
  down voted for saying the quran and it 's hadiths requite context ? 
  i 'm sorry but that is fundamentally incorrect and not how islamic rulings work at all . 
  every ruling is based on every relating verse in the quran and hadiths and the general thinking of the time . 
  so to make a ruling about something , you collate all of the quran verses , find all the hadiths that relate to the topic , figure out which hadiths are the strongest and most reliable . 
  then you interpret them all based on the evidence and then make a ruling . 
  then to actually make a judgement from islamic ruling you look at what the general thinking of the scholars is and make and final ruling based on what the scholar community believes . 
  it 's entirely incorrect to just say the quran and hadiths are not up for interpretation . 
  the quran is the exact word of god , but it still requires interpreting alongside hadiths that have varying meanings and origins . 
  i agree that many rulings are based on outdated principles . 
  there is some wiggle room for modernisation in islam , but not much . 
  slavery is agreed to be illegal now , where it was previously legal but freeing slaves was encouraged . 
  and on the topic of isis . 
  they do some things islamically , some.things they do n't . 
  whichever suites them . 
  for example : 1 . the burning of people is strictly illegal and not an allowed punishment . 
  but they still did it to that jordanian pilot . 
  the killing of non combatants is strictly illegal but we all known they 've twisted the ideas of `` kuffar '' and `` infidel '' to suite their means . 
  where the quran would refer to killing infidels , the context was always during war times and when the infidel was the aggressor . 
  but now anyone not supporting them is an infidel who can be slaughtered at will . 
  drug use is n't permitted but is rife within the caliphate , especially amongst soldiers . 
  there are tonnes of more contradictions that isis are guilty of that i ca n't think of right now . 
  they will use whatever they want to do whatever they want because at the end of the day they are a bunch of violent cunts using the idea of a caliphate to `` gloriously '' ride into battle and act how they please . 
  they are islamic but they do not represent `` true islam '' . 
  mate how the hell have you been so close to that many attacks ?!, 
  that 's crazy but good to know you survived . 
   there 's nothing that pisses me off more than cynical jackasses in an temperature-controlled office half-a world away taking advantage of people getting killed for their short-sighted political bullshit . 
  hear-fucking-hear . 
  reddit , and the world tbh , is full of people who just want to jump on every attack and post some smarmy retort about islam without thinking about anything . 
  something i try to raise awareness of is the motive behind these attacks . 
  what are the motives , what do they aim to get from doing this ? 
  for isis , it 's almost certainly to intensify the hate of muslims in the west and encourage more attacks to push for the eventual apolocalyptical war with `` infidels '' . 
  they literally ** want ** the west to hate muslims , just like this `` religion of peace '' wankers keep pushing , so that the west persecutes and oppresses them to the breaking point . 
  yet if i try to say `` maybe we should n't go on hate sprees of all muslims because we 're playing the part isis want us to '' , i get called a muslim apologist cuck . 
  there 's no fucking winning with them . 
  and if you try to encourage a wider discussion about islamic terrorism , as there is a problem that needs to be addressed , it always devolves into straight up hate that only helps cunts like isis . 
  people are fucking idiots . 
  no wonder i 'm so nihilistic . 
  sorry for the rant . 
  this bugs me so much and with the rise of trump it 's become harder and harder to have a real discussion on reddits main subs . 
  so you 're telling me the blatantly anti-immigration man , who went on a gun rampage trying to kill non-whites , did n't actually want to achieve the political aim of getting immigrants out of sweden ? 
  if those mental gymnastics let you believe the mans not a terrorist then you are deluded . 
  i thought the one in nice was linked to a group somewhere ? 
  the dude may have been nuts but i do recall evidence he had received large amounts of money that he 'd sent to family . 
  either way , i do n't know if the term `` terrorism '' is overused or not , but it fucking bugs me how so many people jump straight on the `` religion of peace '' hate bandwagon without thinking of wider context , or if the dude was just mental . 
  the guy in london the other way was clearly very violent before converting but people still say islam was the reason . 
  terrorism is literally defined as committing violence for political gains/purposes . 
  you 're telling me that targeting non-whites because of your anti-immigration stances does ** not ** qualify as terrorism ? 
  that 's some bullshit right there . 
   a singular attack without backing from a bigger organization will not likely achieve any political gains though . 
  if you 're going to nit pick about whether the attacks achieve any political gains then most `` terrorist attacks '' could arguably not qualify . 
  many islamically motivated attacks have no clear aims bar fuck shit up and kill people . 
  and in the same vein , does that mean non-white people ca n't be racist since they do n't have the wider societal backing to further their oppression ?
