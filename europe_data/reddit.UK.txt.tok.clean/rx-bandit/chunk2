  you 're looking for meaning in something that , for most of them , is pretty meaningless . 
  i 'm sure there are some arseholes there who literally do mean their god is greater , but to most of them it is simply just a phrase in every day language . 
  i 'm not a muslim , or particularly religious . 
  they do . 
  i 'm agnostic and say all of them regularly . 
  phrases like those , and allahu ackbar , have embedded themselves in conversation and are now said even when you 're not religious or are n't using it in any religious context . 
  they 're saying it because it 's something they say habitually . 
  and so the problem you have is the rock throwing and not that they are chanting `` allahu ackbar '' . 
  which is entirely fair enough , stone/bottle throwing is n't acceptable in any situation . 
  not at all . 
  i 'm in work procrastinating and i saw a repeated misunderstanding . 
  half of my family is muslim and i have a few muslim friends and the term is said so often it is pretty much meaningless . 
  you do n't get it . 
  it 's a very common phrase appropriated for everything in the arab world . 
  it 's not connected to anything . 
  you can connect it to violence if you want but the real use of it in arab conversation has no connection , it 's just a phrase . 
  it 's a cultural saying . 
  like an english speaker saying `` fuck me '' in a situation . 
  they could say it when hearing good or bad news , shocking news , whatever . 
  it 's appropriate and no one is actually saying it wanting someone to go and fuck them . 
  they 're not saying it for that purpose . 
  you really do n't understand the use of it in the arab and muslim world . 
  it 's become known in the west as something a terrorist says but in reality it 's used as an exclamation for almost any situation . 
  remember that video of men in syria pulling a baby out of rubble ? 
  they repeated `` allahu ackbar '' through out the video . 
  i 've had muslim friends use it when they 've passed a test , when a family member gives birth . 
  it can be used in literally all situations from peaceful to violent . 
  yep , allahu ackbar is an exclamation that can be used in almost any situation . 
  you pass a test ? 
  suitable . 
  have a near death experience ? 
  suitable . 
  see a friend after a long time ? 
  suitable . 
  it 's more a religious saying that 's permeated into culture . 
  the only people that wold whistle my wife and make her uncomfortable in the uk are white van men / builder types . 
  we 've lived in heavily arab/muslim areas and have never had a problem . 
  yep . 
  as much as countries like iran have been at odds with the west they 've never done any significant damage or anything crazy . 
  shia terrorism appears to be almost entirely political and very localised . 
  and people claiming to be shia are far less likely to commit acts of international terrorism . 
  almost all large attacks on the west have been by sunni muslims , while the closest thing to shia terrorism is hezbollah ( who largely focus on israel ) and sectarian terrorism in muslim countries themselves . 
  yes that is true , i was just reading about it . 
  that 's the dublin treaty right ? 
  germany has revoked themselves from it so refugees can legally travel across europe to get there . 
  but that does lead to the issue that the poorer eastern and mediterranean countries will have to deal with the refugee intake alone , except for financial assistance , which is n't fair in my opinion . 
  i thought that was sarcasm . 
  of course not , but this war could go on for another 1,2,3 , or 4 years . 
  no one knows . 
  they 're not actually allowed to violate any national borders . 
  the well known issue with asylum is there are no legal methods to get into a country so that you can claim asylum . 
  if they want to escape their country they ** have ** to break the law and the world accepts this because if refugees actually followed this law they would never be able to get to safety . 
  because arming rebel ; groups has never back fired ... ever . 
  your attitude is pretty naive . 
  a lot of people do n't want to fight , a lot of people do n't want to fight with any of the groups out there , a lot of people would rather save their family and escape than fight , a lot of people do n't see that there is even anything worth fighting for . 
  i think the last one is very important . 
  a good chunk of the refugees are running from assad controlled areas . 
  the civil war started because he would n't step down , even when millions protested his government . 
  he has bombed the absolute shit out civilian areas killing hundreds of thousands and tortured / maimed a lot of people . 
  many of the people running now do n't see the point in fighting , they tried to beat assad and the country is now an absolute state . 
  they do n't see the point in fighting when the country is the enemy . 
  ** when ** the war is over . 
  god knows when it will end . 
  and currently it looks like assad is the only viable candidate to lead in post civil war syria , so what happens to the millions who have fled from his regime ? 
  i doubt many would want to return even if assad claims he wo n't murder them . 
  i do n't doubt there will be some isis members in with in the refugees , but thousands ? 
  sounds like complete bullshit to me . 
  isis claims there are thousands , but they also say they 're going to invade the vatican and plant a flag on the white house . 
  it 's far more likely there 's a few infiltrating and isis are just exaggerating . 
  perhaps because everyone keeps asking the same question ? 
  but it is still the current legal definition . 
  if you do n't agree with it go campaign for it to be changed . 
  until then you are flat out wrong in calling them economic migrants . 
  [ by definition they are refugees  ( http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/glossary#r ) < a refugee is a person who ` owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group , or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality , and is unable to or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ... ' not wanting to stay in a country and move on does n't make them any less of a refugee , by law . 
  [ there is no mention in refugee law that states a refugee must claim asylum in the first safe country . 
  ] ( http://www.amnesty.org.uk/truth-about-refugees#.vff3bu5enng ) they are legally allowed to claim asylum in any country that they want .

  by law and definition it does n't matter how many countries these people pass through they are refugees because they were forced to flee their home countries for fear of death . 
  choosing not to stay in turkey , greece or germany does not make them any less of a refugee .

  i do n't blame israel for not taking refugees . 
  every neighbour around them hates them with a passion . 
  it would be crazy for them to taken in refugees . 
  saudi arabia is supposed to be part of the muslim ummah and be bending over to help their muslim brothers and sisters . 
  defending their country with who and what ? 
  if they 've run they probably hate assad and isis . 
  if they go back to fight they will have no weapons , support or allies to fight two large enemies . 
  i saw a syrian man commenting on facebook about this . 
  when he was asked why he does n't go and fight for his country he said `` why would i go and fight for my country when my country is the enemy ? '', 
  money is one thing , but helping out a neighbour would mean a lot more . 
  saudi arabia could do that but choose not to and spend money to act like they 're doing something . 
  i do n't see why america would bother . 
  america get a regional ally and use of bases from the saudi 's . 
  saudi arabia gets a powerful ally and not much else ( to my knowledge ) so america would n't have much leverage . 
  probably . 
  it would be an absolute minefield if they were to open their doors .
