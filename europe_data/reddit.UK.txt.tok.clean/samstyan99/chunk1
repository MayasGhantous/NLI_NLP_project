yeah that 's what i 'm saying . 
  the meanings switched , so in english ` dog ' became the general word for the animal , but other languages borrowed the word to mean more specific breeds . 
  ** hound ** used to be the general english term for dog ( shared with ** hund ** in german ) , and ** dog ** meant a ` mastiff ' . 
  around the 16th century ** dog ** became the standard word for ` dog ' in english , but in other languages it still has a more specific meaning : french ** dogue ** , finnish ** doggi ** , russian ** \u0434\u043e\u0433 ** . 
  so some weird etymology switching was going on . 
  cumbrian : ( northern english dialect ) ** mara ** = ` mate ' ( really commonly used ) ** boyo ** ( not as common , used more around carlisle area i think ), 
  in england and wales we use a * - u grades for gcse 's , a-e grades for as levels , and a * - e grades for a2/a-levels . 
  a * , a , b , c are generally considered ` pass ' grades . 
  the grades roughly correspond to : a * - 90 % a - 80 % b - 70 % c - 60 % d - 50 % etc. . . 
  but these can vary a lot . 
  i remember taking a gcse biology exam where i only needed 55 % to get an a. 
  it 's a stupid system and the number system used in literally every other european country makes so much more sense ... 
  welsh is mandatory in secondary school , although i went to a welsh-speaking primary school so was forced to speak it in school between the ages of 4 and 11 . 
  my secondary school classes were a mix of english and welsh , and i had mandatory welsh language classes in school until 16 . 
  we learned french from ages 11 - 14 . 
  then 14 - 16 we could keep going with french or switch to either german or spanish . 
  and i live in north wales ( i think things are different in south wales ), 
  [ ambleside ] ( https://www.visitcumbria.com/wp-content/gallery/ambleside/6-ambleside-4365b.jpg ) is at the head of lake windermere , and at the confluence of two small rivers . 
  i 'd say the ratio 's about right . 
  yeah i know , but you 'd be hard pushed to find someone speaking in a strong cumbrian accent who does n't use at least a bit of dialect . 
  same with scottish - someone with a scottish accent will always use a little dialect , even if it 's just using words like ` wee ' . 
  yeah , i do n't think people from outside of the uk realise how much regional variation we have because the main exposure is on standard american english , or a standard received pronunciation uk accent . 
  if ars spek int proper northun cumbrian dialect nae yan 'd ken a word of what us say !, 
  ~ now there 's some proper northern dialect for you haha, 
  yeah welsh ( my native language ) is exactly the same . 
  the most common replacement for ` yes ' in welsh is ` ydw ' ( it is ) but there are a whole ton of different words that replace yes in different contexts . 
  informally we say ` ia ' and ` na ' for yes and no , but this is definitely an english influence . 
  in regards to the whole scottish thing , i read that people from edinburgh apparently speak the ` best english ' , i.e. 
  they speak the most grammatically correct form of the english language - prescriptively speaking anyway . 
  also , i think the idea of a ` scottish english ' is misleading . 
  scotland has so much accent variation , especially if you include people speaking scots - a scottish dialect of english , and gaelic - a completely seperate scottish language that has no relation to english . 
  scotland has a lot more accent variation than wales does . 
  i do n't think there is only one accent type that can be called ` scottish english ' . 
  i live in cumbria , an english county that borders scotland , and even within the north of my county the accent starts to sound like a weird mix of english and scottish and geordie ( newcastle ) . 
  basically , the uk is a big mess of accents !, 
  i 'm a native welsh speaker , for me the biggest difference is word stress , i naturally stress certain words and syllables differently to an english speaker . 
  when you hear a ` typical ' welsh accent you can kind of hear that the stress is more up-and-down ( ca n't think of a better word to describe it ) . 
  i just think it 's hypocritical that the us has bombed syria in response to assad 's use of chemical weapons , yet will not accept any refugees that are fleeing syria for reasons such as assad 's use of chemical weapons . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eld2awfn9nc ) is awesome , there 's actually a whole bunch of them now but the dutch did the first one ], 
  isis is still definitely the most popular term in england/uk . 
  daesh is more common in france . 
  uhhh struggling . 
  i 'm actually learning dari , not farsi , and there are no resources available for learning online : / i need to speak dari for my job , as well as a few other languages . 
  well if you need someone to help i 'd be happy to struggle through together . 
  i speak english , ( native ) welsh ( fluent , went to a welsh-immersion school ) , french ( near fluent , my dad speaks it ) , and farsi ( conversational , self-taught ) . 
  i can string together a few words in spanish and portuguese but definitely would n't say i * speak * those languages . 
  and studied latin at school , but obviously that 's never going to help me when travelling abroad !, 
  this definitely is n't the norm in the uk though , most of my school friends speak english and welsh ( to varying degrees of fluency ) , but that 's just because of the area where i grew up . 
  i think the majority of people in the uk use non-stick pans , but many still use cast-iron - my family included . 
  i would n't say the whole of the uk either uses one kind or the other , we definitely have a mix of both . 
  haha well the uk is an island , and the only proper neighbour we have is ireland , so i thought i 'd just it as an excuse to share some stereotypes , 
  yeah i think we 're lucky to live in such an old country . 
  like my house was built in the 1600 's , so it 's older than your entire country !, 
  where were you volunteering ? 
  yeah britain has become very americanised , we share a lot of similar views . 
   yeah that does suck - what 's the point of going on a trip to another country if you do n't get to experience the culture ? 
  nah sorry but i have to call bull on that . 
  russia is n't going to invade the baltic states anytime soon . 
  this is just the american media trying to make a news story out of nothing . 
  ok these are just general stereotypes from a british perspective ( please do n't take offense ! ), 
  : ** germans ** - hard-working , industrious - but lacking a sense of humour . 
  ** french ** - rude , arrogant , but also sexy and stylish . 
  parisiens are seen as unfriendly and impolite . 
  also brits love making fun of the french for not putting up more of a fight in ww2 - they have a reputation for surrendering , and we have a whole category of jokes dedicated to this , e.g. 
  * q : what is the most useful thing in the french army ? 
  a : a rearview mirror , so they can see the war . 
  * ** italians ** - lazy , but great food . 
  ** irish ** - fun , friendly people - they drink a lot , and they 're a bit dim . 
  ** swiss ( german-speaking ) ** - cranky , even more so than the germans . 
  ** swedes ** - blonde hair , blue eyes . 
  eco-friendly . 
  a bit uptight and square . 
  high standard of living but everything is very expensive . 
  we generally look up to the scandanavian countries , e.g. 
  finland 's schools , norway 's green energy , sweden 's maturnity care . 
  ** danes ** - friendly and easy-going . 
  danes like their alcohol . 
  ** belgians ** - their political system is a mess . 
  the flemish and the walloons hate each other . 
  the belgians are seen as a bit stupid ( but i think this is more a french stereotype than an english one ) . 
  honestly we do n't really have any strong views about belgium , just that it 's a bit boring i guess . 
  ** scottish ** - rowdy , fight a lot . 
  they do n't like the english . 
  the further north you go in the uk , the more people drink . 
  they swear a lot . 
  bulgaria . 
  great weather , beautiful beaches and mountains , cheap cost of living , cheap to buy a property , not super touristy ( with the exception of maybe sunny beach ) , and lovely people . 
  yeah definitely , but only the us , we do n't learn about ` the americas ' , only america . 
  at least that 's how it is in the uk anyway . 
  for my modern history gcse i had an exam on the cold war , and an exam on 1920 's america/the depression . 
  ouch . 
  that 's got ta hurt . 
  that 's so crazy . 
  the iom is very much a part of the uk , why would they do that ? 
  yeah ... 
  why were n't you eligible ? 
  i 'm 17 , so was n't even allowed to vote . 
  the amount of money that the us spends on elections is ridiculous . 
  in the uk we have laws to stop political parties from spending too much money on campaigns , and god forbid if somebody over spends * cough * tories . 
  `` would you like a cup of tea ? '',
