i can do that with something on roughly the same scale , like the euro or the us dollar . 
  but if i 'm in vietnam for a month i still have to do the maths on each purchase . 
  the mail sells about 8 times what the guardian does , i 'd say it 's a far better example of what is typical ( sadly ) . 
  it 's sort of amazing and depressing at the same time , one poppy for every british ~ ~ casualty ~ ~ death ( ~ 850,000 ) . 
  i ca n't begin to imagine how big it would be if they did the same for all countries ' casualties . 
  my pics from visiting last week [ 1 ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t31.0-8/10733747_557963331016846_8971699503700223741_o.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( https://scontent-a-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10432129_352536868248459_261256040823370489_n.jpg?oh=549e39371affded7b03148fbe1d302f0&amp;oe=54d94f22 ) . 
  reminds me of my french oral exams . 
  i 've still got # 15 of northern irish money from when i visited 3 years ago , i do n't have the balls to try and spend it . 
  now it 's lying next to some francs and pesetas . 
  give them another 10 years and we 'll see . 
  i think you underestimate our politicians . 
  so you 're austria 's scotland ? 
  well nobody pretends it does n't have a strong right-wing bias , i do n't think anyone in the uk buys a newspaper expecting an unbiased analysis of the news . 
  but it has done some good journalism ( the [ mp 's expenses scandal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal ) is probably the best example ) . 
  also it 's the only non-tabloid right wing paper . 
  so if you lean that way but you do n't want to know about kim kardashian the telegraph is your best bet . 
  well i 'm not counting ukip as a significant political party , they do n't have a single mp and are n't likely to get any more than 2 or 3 seats in the next general election . 
  as for the conservatives it 's true that a lot of their members have those opinions , but the party 's official stance is still that the uk should remain in the eu ( but we should try to renegotiate our membership ) . 
  labour do n't want to offer a referendum at all unless popular pressure forces them to , and the lib-dems love the eu . 
  well the eu ( particularly if the uk leaves ) is heavy on regulation of financial services . 
  regardless of whether that 's a good thing or not it does make it harder to build a financial hub . 
  i imagine if the uk left the eu then the city would keep most of its business by having looser regulations and less taxes . 
  please note i 'm not suggesting that this is a good thing , just what i think would happen . 
   i sometimes wonder how strong the ties between british politics and the british press still are . 
  i tend to guess that those bonds are very strong , given how much of a coordinated effort there seems to be against the eu for example . 
   not sure what you mean ? 
  all the major parties in the uk are officially pro-eu membership . 
  i completely disagree , regardless of whether they ought to be respected , the guardian and the telegraph are both very respected in the uk . 
  the times is the only other newspaper that 's taken seriously but it 's dull as shit ( less partisan ) so it gets less attention . 
  i also think that they 're both good newspapers , they 're extremely biased of course but i do n't expect anything else from print media . 
  11 days, 
  technically the most accurate , but it 's not a nice looking flag . 
  i think you 're wrong , us english would much prefer to carry on doing what we already do with northern ireland , ignoring it . 
  any debate about it joining roi or an independent scotland would just cause the troubles to blow up again , everyone 's happier to just stick with the status quo . 
  i think manchester is fairly well liked , at least compared to birmingham/glasgow/hull / liverpool ... 
  seems legit , nice to see the french have finally realised that we are superior . 
  due to be may 2015 . 
  you mean between the mainland and europe ? 
  ^ ^ ^ / s also it would seem sensible to have the london-paris connections going through lille seeing as that already happens . 
  eurostar has metal detectors for passengers and x-rays for luggage just like an airport , but it normally only takes about 15-20 mins . 
  i know , but when i first looked i just saw the uk flair . 
  it 's true it 's not the most [ picturesque location ] ( http://img1.photographersdirect.com/img/5227/wm/pd1071540.jpg ) for it , but i like how it 's a landmark on the a1 , one of the main roads into the north ( the london-edinburgh road ) . 
  nice choices , i would have chosen mostly the same but i 'll put 7 alternatives * [ oxford university ] ( http://riverwayranchcamp.com/files/2012/10/oxford-university5.jpg ) * [ angel of the north ] ( http://andromedababe.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/angel4001.jpg ) * [ forth rail bridge ] ( http://d29d7780s981k0.cloudfront.net/files/cache/81b3f6c6dc49b06df65e42daee4784ff.jpg ) * [ channel tunnel ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02156/channel-tunnel_2156966b.jpg ) ... only half ours but that 's the point i guess . 
  * [ scottish highlands ] ( http://www.inverglenphotography.com/imgs/home/lrg_21596_175740852050a368153d538.jpg ) * [ the shard ] ( http://www.visitbritainsuperblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shard.jpg ) * [ edinburgh castle ] ( http://www.ames.lt/uploads/images/kursai%20uk/edinburgas_1.jpg ) edit : just realised yours were only england , obviously these are for the uk . 
  yeah , i honestly ca n't see us ever using them except in retaliation . 
  that 's why we have trident after all , so we can retaliate even if we 're struck first . 
  i suppose if there was a war using tactical nukes on military targets we might do the same , but nobody wants to risk escalating . 
  well most nuclear powers have something like the uk 's trident submarines so that they can strike back even after being destroyed , which hopefully removes the idea that striking first is in anyway profitable . 
  it has n't been too bad here , it was pissing down all last night but cleared up at about 10am this morning , just been very windy, 
  i 'm near wimbledon so about 30-40 mins from central london on the tube ( metro ) but still very much in london not just the metro area , also it 's a lot more densely populated than it looks in this picture , there are a few blocks of flats to either side just out of the picture as well as the one i 'm living in . 
  why is the uk getting it cheap ? 
  not that i 'm complaining but we 're importing less than germany and not getting it direct from russia so you 'd think we 'd pay more . 
  the ones i regularly get here ( london to manchester ) have free wifi for first class but standard class have to pay ( and it 's shit i 'd rather use 3g ), 
  is it bad that it makes me feel a little patriotic ? 
  is there anywhere in western europe where that is n't true ? 
  or eastern europe for that matter ? 
  indian food for sure [ tikka masala ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken_tikka_masala ) , [ jalfrezi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jalfrezi ) etc. 
  of course they are n't exactly `` british '' but they 're a massive part of our cuisine and have been adapted to the point that they 're probably more british than indian . 
  any pub that describes itself as serving `` traditional british food '' is guaranteed to serve a tikka masala . 
  that 's because it does n't include exports within the eu, 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/muudgm1 ) you go , from wimbledon , london, 
  well you can always unpeg it if you need to , whereas if you 're actually on the euro you ca n't easily change back . 
  depends on your point of view , for a federalist it 's great , but not so much for those against integration . 
  if the ep is allowed to just announce that it 's giving itself the power to choose the commission president ( no treaty change or whatever ) then that suggests the ep is more powerful than the national governments , and it gives legitimacy to the post which is bad if you do n't want the post to have any power . 
  essentially its part of a trend to give more power to the eu vs member states , which is probably seen as a good thing for a lot of people but not the direction the uk wants to head in . 
  it 's a bit ironic because a lot of euroskeptics have complained about a democratic deficit but in reality the last thing they want is to give the eu more legitimacy by making it more democratic . 
  the rest of the uk is n't too bothered either way if scotland leaves , most would rather that they stay for nostalgia 's sake but it 's not something we lose sleep over , so that is n't the most effective threat . 
  i 'd like to think the eu would be able to treat the uk leaving as an amicable separation , we could still cooperate closely without taking part in federalisation . 
  if the eu were to take the path of making an example out of us then that would only confirm that we were right to leave , one of the reasons that i personally am pro-eu is that i trust it more than our national government and eu politics have generally been above that sort of pettiness . 
  we get on fine on the issue of trade , it 's the political union we have problems with . 
  ( of course there are problems on trade too , but they 're not so big as to provoke our exit from the eu ), 
  have you been to india ? 
  i have and i think you 'd be surprised . 
  i met far more indians who mentioned positive things about the uk and our relations than negative things , and the vast majority did n't seem to think that colonialism was an issue . 
  well in all fairness they said the exact same thing about us not joining the euro , but in this case i happen to agree . 
  i 'm no expert but plenty has been said on this topic , e.g. 
  monetary union without fiscal union , economic imbalance between eurozone countries ... edit : just to add i do n't personally think the euro is `` broken '' , but it clearly was at least partially responsible for the crisis . 
  i worked in france as an english language assistant for a year , its decent pay and accommodation was provided , and i did n't need any qualifications ( i did need to be able to speak a decent amount of french ) . 
  in a lot of smaller european countries you could probably do the same without having to know the local language . 
  it could be worth doing a quick tefl course if you want to do this . 
  no they would n't , they can get away with not offering a referendum but cancelling an already scheduled one would be political suicide . 
  i got romanian as my # 1 native language on my first try . 
  apparently i 'm a romanian who 's learnt singaporean english, 
   the uk does n't need to be part of a large trading bloc i think this is a large part of it . 
  we 're still the 6th largest economy and the 6th largest produced of manufactured goods . 
  perhaps unlike slovakia or estonia we can quite easily make our own trade deals and survive fine on our own . 
  most british people like the idea of the eu but we do n't feel that we need it , so we 're able to consider the disadvantages too , which maybe some of the smaller countries are n't able to do . 
  this figure is only if we were cut off from all imports and had to rely on our own resources . 
  i forgot sorry, 
  and greece , lets not forget greece . 
  ireland too, 
  please do n't judge us by what some far right politicians and newspapers have done/said . 
  besides i think anyone who takes the time to look at it can see that immigration has been good for our economy , a cheap workforce always is . 
  the problem is that wages have been suppressed for working class british and the speed of immigration has made people feel like our culture is threatened . 
  it 's 50/50 between viewers and the jury from each country . 
  well ireland have already entered a [ turkey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps3kxgo_gro ) in 2008, 
  i think it was the `` rapid reaction force : so they can decide to do nothing even faster '' part that 's being referenced . 
  i think we 're more anglo-saxon than norman, 
  i can sympathise with ukip 's anti-eu policy ( although i do n't agree with it ) but they 've shown hideous amounts of racism/xenophobia , denying climate change , against gay marriage and generally seem to be stuck in the 1950s if not the 1800s . 
  anyone can get the loan for tuition fees and some living expenses ( not enough to cover them ) .
