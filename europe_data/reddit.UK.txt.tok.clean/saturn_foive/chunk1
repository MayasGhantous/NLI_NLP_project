   you are 41.5 % european , and you scored closest to italy , with a similarity of 54.1 % !, 
   you can have the best chef in the world , fish and chips will still be bland u wot m8 ? 
  [ here 's a helpful guide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnu8xdbsn10 ), 
  glorious empire ... 
  i wish :(, 
  so how come no country has pizza beer and boobs on their flag ? 
  brb , got ta copyright one thing ... 
  ok , enough reddit for you , back to work !, 
   when he raised his arms the danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall , the estonians turned the danes back . 
  attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the danes surged forward again . 
  i 'm pretty sure danes need a lesson on [ correlation does n't imply causation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/correlation_does_not_imply_causation ) , 
  and all together represents ugliness :p ( i fully accept any and all downvotes , but it had to be said ), 
  so the landlocked country is the one with blue , because of the sea ... 
   hah , poles are ridiculous on this sub  victim complex is beyond proportion  inability to see anything your nation has done  your country is a propaganda filled joke no , tell us what you * really * think !, 
  thanks !, 
  people starving and putin destroying evil * western * food . 
  for the motherland . 
  screw mothers , though . 
  w-t-f ? 
  til sweden has a glasgow , 
  stabbing ? 
  did they finally run out of grenades ? 
  any relation to brevik ? 
  so banning encryption is not among the steps ? 
  it would be very interesting to see a map per nobel category . 
  there are wankers everywhere ... 
  nice to see hungary and poland so close  and both are brilliant workers !, 
  i do n't understand the downvotes ... it was created by turkish immigrants in berlin , afaik . 
  they transformed their typical grilled food plate in a fast-food format and that 's when it became so popular . 
  is this an urban legend ? 
  it is clearly outdated , all about cristiano now , 
  i just want to say that you both make good points . 
  please continue , 
  you 'd only need to get hold of one rifle to wipe out all the marines on the plane . 
  of course i 'm assuming that smuggling a clip of ammo is easier than smuggling a whole rifle and a clip of ammo . 
  what if the plane is not * filled * with marines but they are in a small group/alone ? 
  do the rules change then ? 
  is there a minimum marines number to bring the rifles on board ? 
  introducing a gun on board creates a risk . 
  what if someone overpowers you ? 
  what if you fall asleep ? 
  what if you pass out ? 
  for people not used to guns it creates an uneasy feeling . 
  it 's about military here . 
  ar15 are for pussy civilians . 
  not even auto mode , losers . 
  also , mandatory 2 year warranty for private customers . 
  if you read the article , that is actually the only thing the russian and dutch reports agree upon . 
  [ i believe they are referencing the five stages of arguing with a russian , stage four in this case ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kdj7zer.png ), 
  are we saying eastern and * awesome * are somehow contradictory ? 
  because anschluss !, 
  that 's what soviet occupation does to you ... 
  i might be pedantic , you are just wrong  have a nice day !, 
  and , let 's face it , the hijab is a big factor . 
  i would imagine it would be the same for sikh men . 
  it 's just weird for some people . 
  i 'm glad that when you point out the glaring flaws in someone 's statement , you just get called pedantic , since they can not argue with arguments . 
  ca n't convince them ? 
  insult them !, 
  always makes my day . 
  i 'm also glad that wishing someone a nice day is interpreted as rude . 
  are you mad that * i * did n't insult * you * ? 
  sorry , mate !, 
  have a splendid day !, 
   there are literally no eusceptic people in the uk that have their political opinion informed by disdain or hatred of continental european cultures . 
  i 'm glad you know every one of them and speak in the name of `` literally everybody '' . 
  have a nice day , 
   cooperation and trade are fine  incredibly naive and suicidal european asylum policy . 
  we seem to have quite different views about the situation . 
  have a nice day . 
   whilst making all of your native industries and enterprises obsolete how do you `` make something obsolete '' ? 
  if you offer better products for a cheaper price , it means it already was obsolete , just the people did n't have access to an alternative ... 
  dreaming about leaving the eu while speaking french . 
  bravo , mate !, 
  we knew things like these were coming the day after the election . 
  feel free to create a new filter #shitukdoes or something . 
  maybe it 's a new anti-immigration policy : do n't come to the uk , we take your porn and give your money to oil companies !, 
  i think it 's just the end of the uk . 
  not `` may '' , it 100 % would if it opened right now, 
  or just visas . 
  i think quite the opposite . 
  see croatia and slovenia for example . 
  it forces countries to behave and try to be civil to one another . 
  never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups ... 
  that sounds silly . 
  let 's build a moat instead !, 
  yep , those that are n't already in dublin . 
  scotland voted 62 % to remain in the eu . 
  scotland voted 55 % to remain in the uk . 
  it 's not a crazy idea . 
  yes , basing decisions on facts is terrible . 
  much better to base them on who has the best suit or makes funnier comments on the telly . 
  most facts i 've seen from the leave camp were lies , fabrications or distorted numbers . 
  so i can only imagine that they voted on `` gut feeling '' . 
  not on informed decisions . 
  not for long , imho . 
  their fear is catalonia breaking away .
