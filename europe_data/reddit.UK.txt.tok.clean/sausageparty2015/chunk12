  what do you not grasp ? 
  yes but can we not obfuscate the reasons many are moving and pretend like there is n't an issue ? 
  safety of jews in france and anti-semitism is a key factor . 
  can you actually provide some evidence of this ? 
  a screenshot or two will do . 
  although i 've got ta say , i 'm bored of people in here talking about what 's going on in the donald . 
  also can we not pretend like anti-semitism from the muslim community is a non-factor in jews leaving france ? 
  it 's been well established it is . 
  love this content free post / s, 
  tribalism is human nature and those ideologues that are trying to make us impossibly fight the human instinct of feeling more comfortable with our `` own people '' are just pushing people further away . 
   and if those `` coloured '' people speak french natively , were born there , eat french , read french , etc , they are just as french as your white guy milking his cows in normandy or white woman tanning topless in biarritz . 
  well at least you 're not flat out saying that `` if they have the paper they 're french '' which is what some extreme ideologues believe about the worth of actual national identity . 
  i 'm curious though to what extent you are willing to describe someone as french . 
  what is `` eat french '' exactly ? 
  if someone only eats halal , are they not considered french ? 
  if someone speaks french but spends all day watching arabic tv channels and has only read the koran in their life `` french '' ? 
  i feel like trying to take the ethnic component out of our identity as nations/peoples is really against our human nature and frankly it is really * is * quite concerning that a city like london [ no statistics for paris ] is currently less than 50 % white british , there are lots of good reasons for being concerned that do n't involve thinking that white people are genetically superior or because you hate people of other skin colours [ you know , the actual definition of racism ] . 
  england [ and france ] are the home nations of specific ethnic groups that share history/culture/lineages so it 's quite normal to be wary of this changing to the point of non-recognition . 
  i do n't see how the above breakdown makes any sense unless there were a stonking great number of 65 + voting . 
  i 'd say that 's definitely a factor in the south of france . . 
   tight and closed immigration is n't either . 
  much of what joining the eu has entailed is against traditional labour ideology , look how opposed jeremy corbyn has been to the eu in the past ( and dl still is ) . 
  i wonder what the average french school experience is like ? 
  there have been several articles ( including a recent bbc article on one about young supporters of lepen ) that mention , essentially , anti-white/anti-french racism in some french schools . 
  that would be enough to make many young french person say `` fuck it '' and vote for lepen . 
  anyway it 's clearly not anywhere near a majority given all the abstentions and the fact she got under 50 % anyway . 
  large scale immigration is nothing to do with the traditional ideology of the labour party . 
  also sure , immigration is just a `` scapegoat '' target , right . 
  keep trying to convince people , they wo n't listen because they know it 's bogus . 
  they also have a big issue with poor maghrebi integration , a lot of conflict there . 
  they 're falsely identifying a moderate increase in european rightist parties by including brexit under `` far-right surgeee '' . 
  so fed up of east coast us liberals telling me brexit was part of a `` far-right surge '' . 
  did n't you know ? 
  young , handsome politicians can solve all our problems - just look and trudeau and oba ... never mind . 
   it ca n't be that hard to say balanced budgets , fair taxes and reduced immigration . 
  so why do so few eu politicians not say this ? 
  labour are case in point . 
  all they need to do to win a lot of voters is back is to say that will be tough on immigration but they 're practically incapable of it . 
  diane abbot - a second generation immigrant herself - is so rabidly pro-immgration as to discredit the party to many disenfranchised voters [ not to mention how terrible she is with numbers ] . 
  diane abbot 's remarks on immigration are a prime example of labour 's disconnect with their traditional ( brexit voting ) base . 
  many french people think this young , charismatic man genuinely can bring change . 
  we just have to see . 
  britain the only country most concerned about immigration , interesting . 
  also most saudis think their country is on the right track ? 
  well they did give women the `` right '' to study recently i guess . 
  so the countries most worried about violence/crime are ... argentina , peru , mexico and ... sweden . 
  that 's a relief to know some people acknowledge it and not all deflect with `` but chicago is worse '' . 
  this is a really fascinating list , could discuss it for hours . 
  some believe a more authoritarian approach is required towards islamists/extremists in general and that includes me , i accept you may disagree on the subject . 
  also marine lepen is hardly a `` random nutjob '' . 
   okay , but londoners voted against brexit . 
  given that now many londoners are second generation immigrants , it 's hardly surprising is it ? 
   i think the best solutions to those are backed by centrist and liberal parties . 
  it 's easily argued that their lax attitudes have led us into this quagmire in the first place http://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-mayor-all-our-mosques-are-controlled-by-salafists/ shit like the above happened exactly because `` liberal parties '' did n't realise the very basic logic of the paradox of tolerance , tried to discredit those shouting about the problems as `` racist '' even when they came from those very communities , the below article being a prime example . 
  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/a-decade-ago-she-warned-of-radical-islam-in-belgiums-molenbeek/2015/11/18/433c8ce4-8d54-11e5-934c-a369c80822c2_story.html liberal and centrist parties have shown themselves to be inept at addressing issues of extremism and delinquency , this is why over a third of french people have voted for an allegedly `` untouchable '' candidate . 
   right , but the question is why . 
  people are manipulated into voting for these parties because they 're lied to that sharia law is descending on them or something . 
  that is independent of what 's actually happening in reality ; it 's based on dishonest media and politicians . 
  i think you have a poor understanding of the situation in europe . 
  in many places within europe there veritably * are * many areas which have undergone a massive demographic shift and are practically unrecognisable . 
  people do n't feel comfortable that - for example , london can go from being 80 % white british in 1990 to less than 50 % white british in 2016 . 
  entire neighbourhoods change , religious , ethnic , cultural makeup switches . 
  people are not `` racist '' nor are their fears always ill-founded about these changes , good god as if rotherham did n't show that . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31027152 i would recommend reading the above article to see that massive shifts in demographics/religions are n't necessarily good for a country . 
  ask yourself after reading the article - what happens when people with these opinions make up 30 % + of the population ? 
  what will france be like then ? 
  who will these people vote for and how will the country change ? 
  you need to open your mind to some tough issues . 
  he 's the barrack obama of france , he will do nothing of note . 
  ok that 's the usa so kind of irrelevant . 
  do you realise how different the european situation is at the moment ? 
  especially in france . 
  how many people have right-wing nutjobs killed in the last few years in france ? 
  please do n't act like right-wing supporters of fn are as big a threat to france as islamists.f . 
   acting the same way the very terrorists that are targeting us is where in lepen 's manifesto did she say she would massacre a hall full of death metal fans ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  seems like it represents the working class dismantling the star ? 
  which is fairly true and pretty neutral . 
  i do n't see pro or anti here . 
   you talk to them , you fix the issues , and you work together to make the whole community better together . 
  let 's hope that actually happens rather than endless threats of sanctions and fines thrown towards the eastern european members of the bloc as voiciferated by macron himself :-), 
  any party that is elected is liked by a good chunk of the `` populace '' and is doing something they like , the term is so unbelievably redundant . 
  pharmaceuticals manufactured in ireland is ireland 's biggest export check this out http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/irl/all/show/2014/, 
  ugh can we stop labelling every right wing party as `` populist '' already ? 
  both `` fake news '' and `` populism ! '', 
  need to die as overused terms . 
  ok but why make that assumption ? 
  it 's just as likely the company * has * had problems with drivers from these countries and have instituted measures to mitigate this risk . 
  she is n't violent but given the indications she has fallen into a group of anti-fa characters , it appears she is on her way to being an extremist . 
   that christian asylum seekers are systematically targeted is the speculative part . 
  except it is n't ? 
  you have hundreds of people telling the organisation they have received abuse/intimidation because of their religion and it 's actually been pretty widely documented . 
  christian refugees have been victimised for their religion in these refugee homes , same goes for homosexuals . 
  there does n't need to be 10 peer-reviewed studies before something like this becomes an `` incontrovertible fact '' . 
   `` but if the support on the ground is at the same time coupled with the aim of deporting young people from germany to the supposedly safe morocco , then these well-meaning ideas can not be successful , '' she said . 
  `` once again , this shows : what the government labels as fighting the causes of fleeing is guided neither by human rights or in this case the well-being of children , but unfortunately serves only to shut people out . '', 
  do they create these green party members in a lab ? 
  how can they be so deluded ? 
   the rest of the article is investigation respectively speculation by dw . 
  violence against christians in refugee housing is just `` speculation '' ?
