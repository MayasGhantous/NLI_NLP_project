  i just assumed it was american because of orson welles . 
  ah , the beauty of the many accents of the british isles . 
  i 'm in brighton , so to most i have a `` southern '' accent and have been told by my scottish friends we `` all sound the same '' , but if i travel 15 miles along the coast i can hear the difference in accent . 
  i know enough glaswegians to understand what they are saying without subtitles , [ unlike many americans ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/trainspotting-made-easy-for-americans-1349197.html ) . 
  ** france : ** mesrine holy motors jour de fete le belle et la bete le samouri michel gondry films ** germany : ** run lola run ali : fear eats the soul ** poland : ** dekalog series ** czechia : ** little otik ** belgium : ** man bits dog a town called panic ( co-produced in belgium , luxembourg and france ) ** austria : ** the third man ( american film , but filmed in vienna ) ** scotland : ** ( i 'm in england ) trainspotting ** italy : ** the bicycle thieves ** spain : ** viridiana ** ireland : ** the guard those are the only really good foreign european films i can think of right now , but might add to this as i remember more . 
  lynx africa, 
  i guess if you were born and grew up in a country , went to school , have freinds , watch tv , learn the history and culture of that particular country , then skin colour does n't really matter . 
  i have black friends who grew up in london , but parents are from various countries . 
  i 'm sure they would feel a very very british if they traveled to nigeria for the first time . 
  download duolingo and learn the basics in french , german and dutch . 
  if you can say ` hello ' , ` goodbye ' , ` please ' and ` thank you ' in each language and also ` do you speak english ? ', 
  that will be enough to show you 're making an effort , they will see you 're trying and speak english back to you . 
  very nice design . 
  i would pick the netherlands . 
  my family are british , but some of them lived in the amsterdam for my childhood . 
  i would visit every summer and christmas . 
  i feel very comfortable there and like the culture and people . 
  i 've been countless times and amsterdam is the city i know my way round most , after brighton and london, 
  i 'm not particularly proud of a lot of my culture and heritage , but i do n't hate it and myself either . 
  i think it is a very important thing , and we are taught it in school , to question ourselves , culture and heritage , instead of just blindly being proud and patriotic . 
  we seem like we hate where we our from and our culture , but really we are just critical , and without being critical of ourselves how will re ever change to make ourselves better ? 
  i play pool fairly often , at least once a month . 
  i specifically go to play , but a lot of the pubs i drink in have a table so why not . 
  since you asked the question i started to think where else i have played pool in europe and i do n't think i 've been anywhere and not played pool at least once . 
  the pool table is a great place to meet people especially if you 're in a different country on your own and do n't have any friends . 
  guilty . 
  ever since brexit i have felt much more european . 
  not sure how interested you are , the word hearse comes from the early/middle english and norman french word for trailor or wheelbarrow . 
  i guess people would cart their dead loved ones around in a wheelbarrow before being buried and the word hearse just stuck . 
  the first time i met my girlfriends parents , i went round for dinner . 
  we were talking politics and i called david cameron a cunt . 
  i knew what i 'd said was bad , but lucky nobody seemed to even bat an eye lid . 
  it might have been different if i 'd called her parents cunts . 
   i thought europeans were against muslim immigration and did n't like islam yes , some europeans are , but not everyone . 
  it 's probably because that is what you see on the news . 
  we mostly just see bigoted trump supports on the news , but i know that not all americans are like that . 
  does brexit count as history ? 
  yeah man , just use the same car , but drive on the otherside of the road . 
  you 'll have to adjust your mirrors as you 're view is slightly different and adjust your lights so you 're not shining them straight into on coming traffic , otherwise it 's fairly straightforward . 
  [ the lake district , north west england ] ( https://www.hfholidays.co.uk/media/assets/image/asset_files/d6wbbg-32.jpg ), 
  from the uk it 's mainly [ skepta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqog5bky2bc ) , [ casisdead ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma3plqhb-4y ) , [ stormzy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxbzuja69da ) . 
  i love that about the french . 
  they do n't put up with any nonsense , just protest , it 's kinda cool . 
  very interesting . 
  although i would still be cautious since it 's unhealthy and rots the teeth . 
  so your saying you are happy for people to walk around ; threating each other , using racist language , giving children death and rape threats , advocating violence and inciting hatred . 
  you 're not only happy or all of that to happen , but you are also happy to defend whoever says those things as their ` right to free speech ' ? 
  * london * edinburgh * cardiff * paris * berlin * rome * vienna * nicosia * copenhagen * amsterdam * vatican city i 've been to a few other countries in europe , but not the capitals . 
  i have n't drunk `` soda '' at a restaurant since i was a kid . 
  and even then i was only ever allowed a small glass , have you seen what happens to kids when you give them that much sugar ? 
  if you 're thirsty drink water . 
  soda does nothing for you . 
  it has no health benefits , does n't rehydrate you , and just makes you fat . 
  british here , but my grandparents lived in amsterdam for most of my childhood . 
  during the 90 's once or twice a year usually at christmas and in summer i would fly between london and amsterdam on my own . 
  first time i was 6 years old . 
  my mum would drop me off , i would fly by myself , and my grandparents would pick me up at the other end . 
  i have now been to amsterdam so many times that apart from my city ( brighton ) and london it 's the city i know bets in the world . 
  there 's something about the mix of ancient history of the silk road , islam and ex soviet infrastructure that makes it such a strange place to visit . 
  i will no doubt visit at some point in my life . 
  also the fact that they ar n't particularly desirable places for many western tourists makes it all the more interesting . 
  guns , the death penalty and working longer and harder . 
  i hate how much time we get off work in europe . 
  i 've europeans tend to care a little more about what is going on in the world . 
  whereas americans ( not all of them ) are more likely to say something like `` why do you think we care '' , or , `` i simply do n't think about other countries '' . 
  although i have spoken to many americans on reddit , who are very interesting and engaging people . 
  from my experience if an american has traveled outside of the us they tend to be a lot more interesting . 
  samosas , onion bhajis . 
  i do n't really eat sweet stuff , but if it had to be sweet i eat a lot of greek yoghurt with honey and banana . 
  i 've always found the central asian countries like turkmenistan and tajikistan interesting . 
  they seem so far away from the world we live in in europe . 
  i opened a bottle of stella at a bbq the other weekend and my mother immediately said `` who 's got the skunk on them then ? 
  '' , which was funny for all the guest who were n't so well versed in the language of herbs . 
  that 's perfect . 
  that happens in every single town across the country on a saturday night at about half past 11 . 
  does the rain in spain fall mainly on the plain ? 
  chinese food is different in whichever country you are in . 
  it tends to be catered for the local tastebuds . 
  i tried chinese food in america and it was overly sweet and sticky compared to what i was used o in britain . 
  i also tried chinese food in spain and that was totally different as well . 
  for england it 's the [ red rose , three lions and the cross of st george ] ( http://image.slidesharecdn.com/englishtraditions-100309130835-phpapp01-130520130715-phpapp01/95/customs-and-traditions-in-the-uk-4-638.jpg?cb=1369055290 ) unofficially it 's [ drinking tea from a massive sports direct mug ] ( http://assets.noisey.com/content-images/contentimage/46075/tinashe-final-1b.jpg ) . 
  this morning i had [ 2 smoked kippers and 2 poached eggs on granary toast ] ( http://www.throapham-house.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/kipper-and-poached-eggs.jpg ) . 
  it was always townies and trevs when i was growing up . 
  i know there were kevs in some places , but over the last decade or so chav has become the ` correct ' name . 
  scallys were from liverpool if i 'm not mistaken ? 
  i guess the closest we have are chavs . 
  ca n't think of any others . 
  i 'm living in the wrong place . 
  you could mayeb buy a fairly big 4/5 bedroom town house in brighton for that . 
  i 'm moving to scotland . 
  american women are idiots . 
  they will literally sleep with a man because of his accent . 
  i 'm not complaining . 
  i was in copenhagen a few months ago and it was really noticeable how attractive everyone there was . 
  but then again i come from an island of bent and haggard old anglo-saxons . 
  technically yes , but at the same time , i would say it is in europe . 
  why is the turkish flag in the banner at the top of this sub ? 
  why do galatasaray play in the european champions league ? 
  why are there talks at the moment around turkey possibly joining the eu ? 
  my aunt is also turkish and she thinks turkey is in europe .
