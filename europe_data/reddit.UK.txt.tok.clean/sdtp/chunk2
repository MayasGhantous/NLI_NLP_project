   i mean , a few people died that 's a pretty big deal in england hahaha . 
  the variety of environment of america . 
  england is beautiful in its own way , but we do n't really have any wilderness . 
  but it still has a lot of diversity . 
  i did n't realise the diversity of culture was what was being called into question . 
  so show me those comments . 
  and show me those comments in comparison to , you know , the entirety of the comments made by all the other americans on this website . 
  the burden of proof is on you my friend . 
   this website has been taken over by the 30-something americans from their mainstream society proof please . 
  in fact let 's have some evidence on the entirety of that nonsensical rant , else ( gasp ) everyone will think you 're an idiot spouting ( oh no he did n't ! ), 
  your opinion ( of which , by the way , no one cares ) . 
  nononono , it 's the * irish * that are always drunk . 
  russians are just violent . 
  i think that 's the same with pretty much everything hahaha . 
  there are positives and negatives . 
  sorry mate but that guy did nothing wrong . 
  by the looks of things he was having a go at someone for making a sweeping generalisation , and then tried to end the argument by saying ` america is a pretty diverse place , you should come visit sometime ' . 
  he did n't say ` america is well diverse and most of the other countries are n't ' . 
  and it 's true , america * is * pretty diverse . 
  have you been there ? 
  it 's crazy . 
  just in california you can go surfing in the morning , skiing for lunch , go to a huge redwood forest for dinner time , head into a city for a drink before heading out to the desert for a spot of star-seeing to finish off the evening . 
  well , that 's if you can do that all in one day ( hint : you ca n't ) . 
  the way people respond to you is way different depending on where you are , also . 
  florida is quite a different place to new york . 
  vegas is like another planet in comparison , too . 
  i could go on and on and on about the diversity of america but i wo n't . 
  america * is * a diverse place . 
  it 's a very unique country . 
  and just because they all are ignorant as to every other country in the world ( sarcasm ) does n't mean we should be too , 
  i have a lot of time for this . 
  maybe so , but that does n't mean it 's the * only * way we can achieve things . 
  by striving to show how much better we are than other people . 
  it * is * ridiculous . 
  brings a thought to mind :  `` you develop an instant global consciousness , a people orientation , an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world , and a compulsion to do something about it . 
  from out there on the moon , international politics look so petty . 
  you want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say , ` look at that , you son of a bitch . '' - edgar mitchell , apollo 14 astronaut . 
  it just makes me laugh really . 
  all this nonsense . 
  all this fighting , power struggles , arguing over what may or may not be better for them or their business associates and growth and capital and blah blah blah . 
  that stuff * is * important , but it 's way less important than fighting all the time . 
  imagine what we could achieve were we to put aside our differences and work together to improve the quality of life for the entire world . 
  or we could meet up once a year at the biggest boy 's house and argue who has the longest dick . 
  high-five for the small garden crew . 
  our garden at our house now has been completely dug up ( we hired a digger . 
  it was amazing . 
  all my childhood dreams came true . ), 
  and we 're replacing it with patio and hanging grow boxes . 
  all those things are very true . 
  there are a lot of things you ca n't do without a lawn . 
  i live in the uk , but i 've never had a garden big enough for a proper lawn , let alone archery , swimming pool , trampoline or any of those things !, 
  my current garden is about 20ft by 25ft , and my previous garden was just concrete :( maybe i 'm just bitter about it haha . 
  lawns in general just do n't make sense to me . 
  they look nice , and are nice to walk on , but i find a thriving garden of plants and vegetables , or overgrown and wild , just as nice to walk in . 
  and considering that the functionality of a lawn is just for aesthetics , and you 're expending water and energy on something that you 're just going to cut up and probably throw away makes little sense to me hahaha . 
  i guess it 's down to personal preference . 
  yeah , and even satire is ignoring it in favour of the royal baby . 
  all jokes are about how ` some woman on benefits had a baby ' . 
  congratulations to those people for having a baby , they are famous and have had a baby , i would congratulate anyone , now let 's move on to something that is * actually * news . 
  and the media 's influence on people is insane . 
  a friend of mine said , `` i do n't see a problem with it . 
  i think people are making a big deal about it . 
  i do n't mind if they want to track me and see if i watch porn . '', 
  i did n't reply , it 's nonsensical trying to persuade someone to see something that is n't status quo until they can see it for themselves . 
  i seriously worry for the state of the internet and privacy in general all over the world . 
  it is becoming easier and easier for the government ( aka ` the powers that be ' ) to monitor the population , and more and more difficult for the people , the common man , to know the government 's true position . 
  here 's a recent article on wired.com : [ cameron 's proposed filters extend to more than just porn 2013 ] ( http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-07/27/pornwall ) and a very poignant video by a youtube video uploader titled [ privacy is over ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldbbefgpx_m ), 
  ** uk ** our primeminister wants to put automatic filters on the internet so that it protects children from porn . 
  recently revealed that the filters will also block things such as dating websites , alcohol , drugs and tobacco , guns , gambling , and a few others . 
  deadpan swedish train drivers wear skirts not in protest , but because they 're comfier . 
  everyone is not sure if it 's funny or not . 
  thanks for clearing that up , i should n't have been so presumptuous . 
  with regards to other comments made regarding our feeling of separatism from europe , i see it simply as being akin to , say , hawaii and mainland usa . 
  obviously there 's quite some distance in comparison . 
  that said , i agree . 
  i think the eu is a bad idea , but in all honesty i 'm not sure of the alternative . 
  i 'm wary of centralised control , such as the north american alliance for economic development . 
  i hate to be the one to bring up orwell , but it seems a similar path as the three nations of 1984 's global power . 
  i may just be worrying unnecessarily . 
  this pleases me in that i 'm glad it 's not just us  have a happy holiday , 
  i 've been told otherwise , and i 've seen in it my granddad 's persona and that of other older people - so much more willing to stop and chat to strangers . 
  whether this comes with old age or simply the way they 've lived , i do not know . 
  all i know is it deeply saddens me that the train station i wait at in the morning has easily 50-100 people waiting for my train , and it 's totally devoid of conversation :(, 
  thanks , i 'm very grateful . 
  what is a shame is that parents do n't spend enough time trying to be a guide for their kids , a mentor even . 
  my mum runs a preschool and has found that her kids , over the 10 years , have grown more disconnected and despondent . 
  she thinks it 's our connection to ` virtual reality ' - our addiction to the online , and i notice it , too . 
  at the train station , throughout my daily routine - people would far rather leave mostly meaningless comments to people they vaguely know on facebook than have a conversation . 
  people always seem so scared to look at me , let alone talk to me , and that 's what 's most sad . 
  english !, 
  ** customs ** i 'll describe christmas as it was when i was a kid . 
  it was better then . 
  * christmas eve * - we 'd have a christmas eve ` brunch ' ( see : food ) with some family friends . 
  exchange gifts , play board games ( our favourite is one called balderdash - you 're given a random word and you have to make up a definition for the word , then you all vote on which one you think is right . 
  great game ) . 
  when they left , we 'd probably settle down as a family and watch a festive movie or something . 
  we might have a light dinner . 
  before we go to bed , we 'd make sure our stockings were hung and we 'd leave a mince pie out for father christmas and a small glass of sherry , and a bowl of water and some carrots for his reindeer . 
  i later found my dad would deliberately messily eat all of it and leave crumbs behind - tell-tale signs that father christmas has been here . 
  * christmas day * wake up , when everyone 's awake we 'd eat a light breakfast and then open presents .
