maybe the very young and old in those areas , wales particularly , but i ca n't imagine them making up anywhere near 5 % or 3 million people . 
  i think the ` do ... ' prefix to questions is unique to english in the germanic language family , and is speculated to come from celtic languages . 
  and also from pre-celtic ancestors , than any of the groups that have entered since !, 
   grey * wet * socialist utopia http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42514000/gif/_42514699_water_serious_map416x.gif i think the north , at least , will survive . 
  if it makes you feel any better you got the top 4 places in 2001 , and we only got 2 instead . 
  bastards . 
  it boggles the mind that shite lagers are so popular here , especially in pubs where they 're at least as expensive as proper ales . 
  perhaps their quality is at least consistent , like mcdonalds or something . 
  that 's interesting !, 
  i hope that i did n't give the wrong impression , i am genuinely curious about what you think about english grammar , it 's something that it 's helpful to have an outsider 's perspective on to understand it because as a native speaker you 're just a fish unable to see the water . 
  from what i 've heard a lot of english 's inconsistent spelling come from pronunciation changes ( the great vowel shift ) that came after the rough standardisation of spellings in the 15th-16th centuries . 
  i 'm not sure why english was unable to update spellings in the way that other languages have been able to , but it 's interesting to think how the political characteristics of nations might play into the development of languages . 
  i think the rhythmic nature of english and how that leads to unstressed and reduced vowel sounds also makes the spelling seem poor too . 
  and the language bears the scars of centuries of slightly misinformed meddlers due to the lack of updated spellings ; hence ` island ' . 
  i would also say that 'd ' does n't replace ` th ' because they 're different sounds , no matter how much second language speakers might try and convince the world differently :p interestingly ( [ and by ` interestingly ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f68vxkmzt1q ) ) although english does n't have a polite way of addressing people ` you ' does derive from the formal way of addressing people . 
  ` thou ' used to be the informal . 
  but i do n't think that you could argue that we 're actually being incredibly polite bastards by always using the polite form from ~ 1000 years ago . 
  what is it that annoys you about english grammar ? 
  nothing more american than a slice of earth potato pie and ice cream . 
  i 'd say the industrial revolution ; genuinely something that we forged ahead of every other country in the world , and has had a huge role in moulding the modern world . 
  it used to be that hitting ` random article ' on wikipedia would send you a random polish village/town/whatever an unusually high amount of the time . 
  like it used to be 1 in 5 , 1 in 10 times . 
  the best explanation i found was that to find a random article wikipedia used to just produce random strings of text , and the first time one matched an article you got sent to that article . 
  literally just random strings of text . 
  i 've had it up to here with these damn diacritics , coming over here , stealing sounds from hard working latin vowels . 
  it once took me 3 months to work out what a frenchman was saying . 
  * * months . 
   `` throughout our trip , breakfast will rarely be more than bread , cold ham , milk , and coffee . '' the bus was silent for a moment . 
  three things in life are certain ; death , taxes and continental breakfasts being disappointing . 
  as well as our answer for least trustworthy . 
  as the maximum value of the house . 
  i think so , but i 'm not completely certain what is and is n't an ale . 
  typically just not too cold . 
  british beer traditionally comes from casks stored in a beer cellar , so is slightly cooler than room temperature , and does n't taste awful so does n't need to be cold . 
  lagers are served cold . 
  are you asking if brits really do drink warm beer in general ? 
  i 'm not even joking , i did n't bother to bring a jumper or a coat out with me today . 
  to be fair it is 12 degrees and not windy or rainy here at the moment , t-shirt weather for sure . 
  there are elections in the speaker 's constituency , but the main parties tend to not put a candidate to stand against the speaker in . 
  [ these ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buckingham_\\ ( uk_parliament_constituency \\ ) #elections _ in_the_2010s ) are the 2010 election results for the speaker 's constituency , for example . 
  it 's a meme that exists because it strokes the ego of americans . 
  at best you can say that american english has retained the rhotism that has been lost in a lot of english accents , but that 's hardly unique and the accents spoken now in england just retained different features . 
  was ? 
  all we have here is some , er , panzies . 
  from what i remember of mine in the uk ( england , so scotland might be different ) :  how is it taught ? 
  what does it cover ? 
  ( in broad lines ) in primary school it 's taught by the same teacher as everything else , in secondary school there are specialised teachers . 
  the first 10-20 minutes might be spent teaching a skill ( e.g. 
  how to triple jump ) and then the rest of the lesson spent playing that sport . 
  typical sports include ; football , rugby , swimming , gymnastics , basketball , ( field ) hockey , tennis , badminton , track and field , rounders , netball  does it count towards the score/average/whatever for college ? 
  no , unless you choose to take it as a gsce or a level . 
   how much time of it do you have ? 
  two 1 hour lessons a week during secondary school , none in 6th form / college . 
   does it have a theoretical component ? 
  no , unless you choose to take it as a gsce or a level . 
  ireland ? 
   `` war is nothing more than a continuation of political intercourse with the interference of other means . '', 
  rounders champions of the world . 
  there 's going to be trouble in ulster ... 
  i presume the meat would n't be halal/kosher even without the pig , it 's not slaughtered in the right way . 
  `` whisky , on the tires '' . 
  any ideas why ` leididi ' , ` frigid women ' and ` saunas ' for the uk ? 
   why is englands independent party homophobic ? 
  / r/england quality . 
  i 'm glad we have this trap . 
  like [ this ] ( http://www.mapsonline.co.uk/app_assets/thirdpartymodules/zoomify/zoomifywatermarkviewer.swf?zoomifyimagepath=/gallery/zoomify/kali-atn-britishisles ) ? 
  i 'm not sure how accurate it is though . 
  crewe for example is listed as coming from the welsh for weir , but that seems just because it has a transliterated name in welsh that coincidentally has that meaning . 
  wikipedia lists some english words from [ romani ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romany_language#romani_loanwords_in_english ) and some more from [ angloromani ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angloromani_language ) . 
  looking at them i 'm not sure about some of the etymologies but i think at least ; chav , shiv , nark and pal are romani derived and in wide use . 
  i also think `` do n't give me any jib '' is a phrase too , to tell someone not to answer back , so perhaps jib too . 
  if he kept his promises better then he 'd be better off too . 
  not to mention that ` christmas ' is a literally christ 's - mass . 
  i love christmas cake and pudding !, 
  sprouts can die in a hole though , and the cake and pudding have to be moist to be nice . 
   weihnachtsmann oh germans , very practical . 
  not much of one for europe unity , though ? 
  i think i was more surprised that we did better than other western european countries , and curious why . 
  good universities and , er , ` borrowing ' people from other countries seem good reasons . 
  ah , so continuing our own proud tradition from athletics !, 
  any ideas on how the uk managed to that well ? 
  it surprised me . 
  she 's not much of a looker , but i love her . 
  famous too , she 's got her picture on wikipedia . 
  personally , and i think i speak for everyone in saying this , i ca n't wait to marry my duck . 
  to be fair jellied eels are hardly a national dish . 
  also ; chips and gravy . 
  it probably should be ireland ( and depending on how you want to look at it scotland and wales too ) , we all enjoy a good drink and have similar tastes in humour , but there is a * bit * of history between us that gets in the way sometimes . 
  maybe the french in southern england . 
  from the guardian , on syria :  lavrov , clinton and brahimi meet in dublin the plot thickens ... 
  tourist traps have their own logic . 
  i ordered a pizza in sarajevo with the toppings ` pepperoni , cheese and ketchup ' . 
  i assumed that something was lost in translation . 
  no , the sauce was just ketchup . 
  i only have myself to blame . 
  it will benefit british manufacturing exports and makes investment and property in the uk more attractive , which london is quite keen on . 
  the uk is reliant on imports though , and a lower value currency will increase costs . 
  germany is better placed than the uk to avoid the import penalty as it has access to the natural resources of the euro area . 
  i also suspect that very high value added work , such as scientific lenses , also avoids the import penalty as a greater proportion of the final value comes from the labour to produce it than the raw materials . 
  germany has done a better job of retaining and developing these sectors than the uk .
