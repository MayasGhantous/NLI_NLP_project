  this sort of comment appears regularly . 
  corruption is alleged against so many eu states , you 'd think the accession process would be harder . 
  yet it seems more a case of ` accept now , worry later ' . 
  it very much is . 
  that and private prisons . 
  check out the wiki for [ private prisons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/private_prison ) . 
  anglosphere loves them !, 
  i guess the downside to overwhelming cultural similarity is we share all our shitty ideas too . 
   `` oh you mean germany 's cute hat ? '', 
  like scotland is to england , 
   a pro-moscow ukrainian oligarch bought the ukrainian service of euronews , and kyiv decided to revoke its broadcasting license . 
  kiev does n't want a news source viewable across ukraine to all of a sudden start supporting putin . 
  seems logical . 
   if this actually works , the rest will probably follow , we 'll see !, 
  haha , if only . 
  i speak only for my own country , but the mood here is far more that `` prisons are too easy , make them tougher '' . 
  yes i know the research very strongly points towards that being a bad idea , but unfortunately this is the mood we are dealing with . 
  i 'd fully support any renewable energy investments in southern europe . 
  its stable and a great way to invest long-term in their economies . 
  gives a permanent role as we move closer to full union . 
  afaik the geothermal plan from iceland to scotland is prohibitively expensive . 
  a great idea but an insane cost . 
  a cheaper method would be renewable investment in the uk in general . 
  we should be the leader in wind and tide in the eu as it is . 
  the resources are huge here . 
  the most amazing thing here is there is a government department that did n't spend every cent they were given !, 
  building solar plants in the me to power europe would be a very bad idea . 
  its far too unstable . 
  the uae is a mixture of liberal and conservative . 
  for example , it has christian churches , is exceptionally liberal in foreign investment and allows the consumption of alcohol ( in certain areas , i.e. 
  hotels ) . 
  it is of course quite strict in other areas . 
  it is commonly regarded as one of the more liberal middle eastern states , and is certainly considerably more liberal than its neighbours . 
  lebanon without a doubt . 
  israel is too , if we are going by middle eastern countries . 
  algeria and tunisia are , though they 're north african rather than middle eastern . 
  if its muslim countries , then maybe indonesia and bangladesh as well . 
  the uae is very liberal in some areas , very conservative in others . 
  kuwait too . 
  you want to say that iran is more liberal than jordan or israel ( not a muslim country , but certainly middle eastern ) ? 
  its good for sweden that they 're putting values and morals above finance . 
  they 'd be right too , as russian citizens live there overwhelmingly . 
   eighter you threaten him into becoming a double agent and feed the russians false information , or you put him in a position where he ca n't do any damage , but you do n't announce you 've outed him they could make an example of him though , and in doing so inform other would-be traitors that poland does n't fuck around . 
  did the dutch government actually publish that ( i see their logo on it ) . 
  if so , that 's amazing !, 
  our leaders certainly criticise farage , but no way would they do this . 
  its certainly a very difficult problem the eu has got to manoeuvre around . 
  every policy has winners and losers . 
  as the union gets deeper , different nations will see their appetite for further integration diminish . 
  it will be interesting to see if brussels can hold the bloc together through policies nations know do not benefit them . 
   in my country , the highest scale starts at $ 35 000 per year ... no extra scales for 100k + , 250k + , 1m + the very simple solutions to that are to increase the earning level before you pay the top rate , and add some higher rates to account for those earning $ 100k or $ 1m . 
   a flat tax rate with a tax-deductable floor could in principle be fairer , in the sense that everyone pays the same amount yes , but inequality as a whole would dramatically increase through the principle of diminishing marginal utility . 
   on the condition that other tax-deducatables are erased off the books that 's the cause of the problem and is different to an argument about flat vs. progressive . 
  making the tax flat does n't solve anything other than reducing total net takings . 
  just remove the tax deductibles and watch as tax revenue increases . 
   that the british public is so deluded to believe it has more friends in washington than in brussels , berlin or paris at the absolute best , we are viewed equally by washington as in berlin or paris . 
  we are all independent nations serving our own interests . 
   when most countries expect neither to do this themselves silly russia . 
  we got economic imperialism for the 21st century . 
  i think it would depend on how the eu nations respond , as oppose to the usa . 
  if the eu is soft and the attacked have to rely much more on american assistance , the eu would struggle to continue . 
  it would become irrevocable to the east that west europe is only interest in them for their economic benefits and does n't care for them beyond this . 
  ~ ~ the discussion is about a flat rate personal income tax , so unless 99.9 % of the population emigrate as a result of a progressive tax rate , that does n't make sense . ~ ~ edit : i misread your comment . 
  nevertheless , it still does n't make sense because tax revenue is combined for the entire population . 
  in a flat system , that 's 21 % of 1m + 21 % of 1,000 = ** 210210 ** . 
  in a progressive system , it would be 21 % of 1,000 + ( example progressive rate of 21 % and 40 % ) 21 % of the first 20,000 + 40 % of the remaining 980,000 = ** 396410 ** . 
  so in that example a basic progressive system yields an extra ** 186200 ** . 
  the logic would be that prohibition ( or excessively high prices ) creates a black market . 
  the goal has always then been to remove the black market ( e.g. 
  the war on drugs or attempts to stop bootleg alcohol in the usa ) . 
  the black market for cigarettes in the uk is very small . 
  rising cigarette prices therefore correlate well with a reduction in the number of smokers . 
  it is only one reason though . 
  health , the effects of second hand smoking ( particularly from parents to children ) and anti-smoking legislation e.g. 
  smoking bans , must also be included . 
   `` flat '' taxes usually have a progressive effect via basic exemption , government transfers and public services . 
  i would argue the absolute opposite . 
  flat taxes have a regressive effect because of diminishing marginal utility . 
  it massively favours higher earners . 
  it also leads to lower overall tax revenue , because the set rate has to be palatable for lower earners . 
  hence why flat tax rates are at the lower levels of progressive taxing nations . 
  for example , estonia is 21 % , russia is 13 % , bulgaria is 10 % , and lithuania 15 % . 
   actually , please make the whole tax system like in estonia . 
  fuck that . 
  quoting from the link given by / u/taenk , estonia has a nearly flat 21 percent income tax rate . 
  that means ginormous tax cuts for wealthy earners . 
  in short , the freedom to tailor monetary policy specifically . 
  add to that a lack of confidence in the eurozone contrasted with confidence in the uk . 
  ireland is one of 19 nations in the ez . 
  it was also hit harder than the uk , so growth there will be expectedly higher . 
  the reason greece , spain , italy etc. 
  do n't post irish levels is because of their lack of a recovery . 
  i do n't see 1 case in 19 disproving my point entirely . 
  not being in the eurozone certainly benefitted us . 
  coincidentally , the main reason growth has n't been better is because our biggest trading partner ( eurozone ) has been under performing . 
  within the eu administration , english is known to be the first language of every department with the exception of agriculture ( french ) .
