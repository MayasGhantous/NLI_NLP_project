  they should do more , i fully agree . 
  but saudi doing nothing does n't give every other country the right to do nothing . 
  unless you think europe should aim only high enough to equal saudi arabia ? 
  britain leads and europe follows , 
  their lives have been completely devastated by civil wars , isis and whatever other horrors exist around syria and iraq ( just two examples ) , they 've been forced into camps that have `` frequent riots , stonings , and gang attacks '' , not to mention `` unrest , exploitation , child labour and sexual violence '' [ ( link ) ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/11/inside-zaatari-refugee-camp-jordan-syria-uprising-three-years ) . 
  but the sum total of your opinion on this is `` that is too bad '' ? 
  nigel farage actually said the uk should let in syrian refugees , then said they 're markedly different from normal asylum seekers by virtue of being refugees . 
  he then got massively criticised by ukip supporters , who could n't see past ` immigrants ' and subsequently retracted the statement . 
  one of the rare times farage says something that made sense . 
  what is ` their own region ' ? 
  in the case of syrians , we ca n't take care of them in syria obviously . 
  if its neighbouring countries , they are already massively full . 
  lebanon for example had 1,000,000 ** registered ** syrians as of [ one year ago ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-26864485 ) . 
  the actual number was known to be much higher . 
  and that 's just lebanon , and just the syria conflict . 
  jordan has more than [ 2,000,000 registered palestinian refugees ] ( http://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/jordan ) alone . 
  add to that the 688,000 syrian refugees estimated from the article linked in the paragraph about syrians . 
  in the uk it is . 
  even more so if you 're sharing a mistress with the soviet naval attache of the day . 
  [ profumo affair ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/profumo_affair ) . 
  i agree nobody has to accept that crimea is part of russia , but if the sanctions are lifted and relations normalised with russia , there 's not much to make them give crimea back to ukraine . 
  east germany is a large chunk of modern day germany , including half of berlin and the entire surrounding area . 
  crimea is a tiny part of russia and ukraine , with the main importance of a strategically significant military base for russia . 
  fair enough if merkel wishes to make such a claim , but there 's no way germany will maintain or increase sanctions on russia for years or decades solely for this tiny peninsula . 
  athletes tend to comment in the heat of the moment , as zlatan did yesterday . 
  that certainly makes them a little more forgivable than actors or other celebrities , who do n't have that same pressure cooker environment . 
  and politicians are our government , so they should be held to a higher standard . 
  no they did not . 
  there 's also a few other things worth noting . 
  for example : emigration to the usa occurs alongside european crises , which makes the emigrants keen to start a new life and to embrace their new home . 
  the irish emigrated largely during the potato famine . 
  [ here 's a wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_immigration_to_the_united_states#immigration_1790_to_1849 ) on emigration to the usa , and here 's a quote that neatly summarises us emigration  `` bad times and poor conditions in europe drove people out , while land , relatives , freedom , opportunity , and jobs in the us lured them in . '', 
  that 's a good reason to develop an additional american identity shared with fellow emigrants . 
  there is n't really a parallel in europe . 
  lots of east european moved west after 04 , but no way were the conditions in those countries as bad as , for example , ireland in the potato famine . 
  its almost as if poland and the baltics have a history of being dicked on by russia , hence why it dominates their foreign affairs atm ? 
  the effort in criticising greece for not going after money held in switzerland would be better placed offering to unite with greece to collectively press for greek and german funds to be obtained from switzerland together . 
  we could even bring in all 28 member states . 
  everyone gets their overdue taxes from switzerland !, 
  it 'd be nice to be a union for once . 
  that sounds very eu . 
  it would also make a great use for the eurostar , which is perfectly british because our government just sold our stake in it . 
  i would support the establishment of westminster constituencies for the 14 british overseas territories ( with some immediate devolution powers as they are each significantly different to the uk mainland ) , though i bet it would create some interesting political battles in the process . 
  you already have strasbourg . 
  give us something !!, 
  thank you !, 
   that does not mean that they are going to loose the industry . 
  it means other nations will enter the industry . 
  spanish , british , danish , irish and french are some that spring to mind . 
   it will shrink to the sustainable level . 
  that 's debatable . 
  the ` total allowable catch ' quota has been controversial and caused debate between those who set it , and researchers in the fishing industry over it being too high ( thus making fishing unsustainable ) . 
   as far as i know our corner of the north atlantic is the only one with a healthy cod population left . 
  ours is certainly fucked . 
  we had stories suggesting there are fewer than 100 fully grown adult cod left . 
  its also thought that the majority of fines are given to spanish fishermen , that the majority of spain 's fishing occurs in waters that belong to the uk and ireland ( shared through cfp ) . 
   h\u00f6fu\u00f0borgarsv\u00e6\u00f0i\u00f0 how would one go about saying that ? 
  i decided to google it , and pol pot was estimated at 1.7 m deaths , which puts him 7th overall . 
  [ here 's the link . 
  ] ( http://popten.net/2010/05/top-ten-most-evil-dictators-of-all-time-in-order-of-kill-count/ ) of course the debates over total count makes this controversial . 
  [ here 's the list of genocides by death toll page . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_genocides_by_death_toll ), 
   russia this past week withdrew from the conventional arms in europe treaty if you 're going to declare a massive war , surely withdrawing from a treaty is going to make fuck all difference to anything . 
  assuming the war ended and russia lost , its not like anyone 's going to give lesser sentences because they withdrew from a treaty beforehand . 
   he 's killed more people than anyone in the world . 
  i thought mao had that title ? 
  followed by stalin in second . 
  yes , any wc can be compared , that 's fine . 
  its a good reason to do a comparison . 
  but that does not make the conclusions correct , because countries are very different ( e.g. 
  population , size or wealth ) . 
  you are seemingly desperate to reject per capita as a tool , when if you took a moment to consider what it means , your arguments would be stronger instead of being flawed . 
  i am not disagreeing with your view . 
  it is just that the method you have used to get there is wrong . 
  you compared russia , a country with 143 million and lots of slaves , with the eu ( 500 million and few slaves ) . 
  per capita would mean equating the population of russia with that of the eu . 
  you can see how many slaves are estimated to live among 143 million russians . 
  now imagine there were 500 million people living in russia !, 
  the conclusion is that slavery is much more of a problem in russia than you have been suggesting . 
   if we care about one slave we should care about a million . 
  you are the one missing the point . 
  that was literally the first thing i said in my last post . 
  here it is again : `` any amount of slavery , whether one person or thousands of people is an issue that needs to be addressed . '', 
   if slavery is an issue than both qatar and russia should lose the wc . 
  i never said qatar should lose the wc whereas russia should keep it . 
  with regards to russia losing the wc , you 'll notice my very first post said the following : `` its a fair point to argue russia 's involvement in ukraine should mean its stripped of the world cup '' if you believe russia 's foreign policy is worthy of them being stripped of the wc , fair enough . 
  if you believe qatar 's is worthy of them being stripped of it , also fair enough . 
  i 'm not contending that . 
  my sole point of contention is that comparing absolute figures for a country with 143.5 million people against a country with 2.1 million is a very flawed comparison . 
  for comparisons between such entities , per capita is needed . 
   if you do n't care about million slaves than 2 is irrelevant . 
  i have never suggested that two is more important than 1,000,000 . 
  again , i 'll refer you to the first thing i said in my previous post : any amount of slavery , whether one person or thousands of people is an issue that needs to be addressed . 
  any amount of slavery , whether one person or thousands of people is an issue that needs to be addressed . 
   if we are to compare actual slavery without world cup we should compare russia to on per capita to countries with similar population per capita . 
  you 've missed the point of per capita . 
  its there to equalise different populations to make comparisons fair . 
  [ this map ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/10/17/this-map-shows-where-the-worlds-30-million-slaves-live-there-are-60000-in-the-u-s/ ) shows the estimated slave populations in different countries . 
  if you look through the article , it explains it very well . 
  some countries may have more slaves than others ( having a massive population makes this more likely ) , but through per capita we equalise the size of nations to show fairly whose problem is worse on a relative basis .
