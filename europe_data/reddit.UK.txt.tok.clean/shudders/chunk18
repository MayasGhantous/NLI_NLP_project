  in which case make the punishments economic sanctions and things like that . 
  kicking russia permanently out of the g8 means ignoring a major world power at meetings of major world powers . 
  the short-term logic is clear but in the long-term its counterproductive . 
  what is the general feeling behind poland and the euro ? 
  being from the uk i see the advantages of not being in it . 
  does being on the mainland itself , especially bang in the centre like poland is , change anyone 's feelings regarding adoption of the euro ? 
   the end result is an arbitrary censure of the european press and people by foreign companies , without any transparency , oversee or control . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  how do you arrive at a result that completely shifts the blame out of europe ? 
  this is our law . 
  if its not working properly it will be up to us to change it . 
   approaching the fifth year of the eurozone crisis , one detects green shoots that , with proper stewardship , may lead to the emergence of a more resilient and successful union . 
  recent output projections suggest that the worst may be over for giips countries , and recovery may be around the corner . 
  its particularly disappointing that five years in we are still saying `` recovery is around the corner '' for some nations . 
  its not being abused , this is exactly the law . 
  the guy wanted the right to be forgotten and he got it !, 
  its likely not too easy for him given his infamy ( as oppose to the average person ) , but he 's not abusing the policy here by any stretch . 
   i personally think cameron is more pro-eu than he lets on to be honest cameron is much more pro-eu than he lets on . 
  his vociferous opposition is because many tory backbenchers feel threatened by ukip and are thus pushing the conservative party towards a more eurosceptic position . 
  as silly as it sounds , cameron 's eu policy therefore has very little to do with the eu . 
  its all a show for the general election . 
  he 's now on record as very publicly blocking a budget increase and even more publicly attempting to block juncker . 
  shite though europe 's opinion of him now is , in both instances he has won a considerable popularity increase in the uk . 
  from the wiki , [ * denmark and the euro *  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denmark_and_the_euro#consequences_of_a_euro_adoption )  when joining the euro , denmark would abandon the possibility to adopt a different monetary policy from the ecb . 
  if ever an economic crisis were to strike specifically the country it would have to rely only on fiscal policy and labour market reforms . 
  there are many disadvantages of the current danish policy also outlined in that article . 
  there are a couple of other advantages too . 
  what 's the deal then with states that have `` no minimum wage law '' , i.e. 
  the navy blue ones in the link you 've posted ? 
  its still a major inconsistency that the commission is ok with austria and hungary signing these contracts but not bulgaria . 
  if austria and hungary are doing it , then i see no reason why bulgaria should n't . 
  i ca n't see what possible argument could be used against them . 
  so why do n't the commission act to block austria and hungary in the same way they did bulgaria ? 
  what makes them different ? 
   it 's true though - the un and icj have increasingly failed as mediators in the last few decades so we 're back to square one of strong countries doing whatever they want but i still think we should aspire and attempt to improve the framework . 
  the sum of it is that the un and international criminal courts , despite having failures and not being perfect , are the best we have . 
  they should remain in place and we should always be working to improve them . 
  sure . 
  if you know exactly how much counterterrorism operations cost , have a knowledge equivalent to that of aivd on counterterrorism and terrorist threats and are not concerned by the threat of returning jihadis . 
   france , specifically , was in a position to end the war within a couple weeks when germany first attacked poland . 
  that strikes me as a massive assumption . 
  you truly believe that france could 've ended the war within a couple of weeks , thereby making wwii nothing more than a small conflict ? 
   ( not necessarily everyone on a jihad in the middle-east will return with the intention to do harm ) the problem is how much money do you want to save ( i.e. 
  not give to aivd ) on behalf of this gamble ? 
  what deeds do you refer to ? 
  how have you managed to reply to a big long post that begins by discussing why germany wants the uk ** in ** europe , in a thread where the german finance minister says he will keep the uk ** in ** europe , with a one sentence post suggesting germany wants the uk out ? 
  not to mention with no backing whatsoever . 
  i do n't agree with the western betrayal perception . 
  i find it very short-sighted . 
  obviously the circumstances of 1939 and 1945 were terrible for poland , there 's no arguing about that . 
  but in both instances the west could not feasibly push in and liberate poland . 
  they were unprepared in 1939 and 1945 was planned and rejected due to fatigue and being massively outnumbered . 
   what exactly is such action as deemed necessary ? 
  that certainly does seem open to interpretation . 
  though in the event of a nation being invaded , small-scale economic repercussions and travel bans would amount to doing nothing anyway . 
   i 'm just voicing my concerns where you seem to be dead certain . 
  i feel more certain the presence of the article and the alliance in general means russia would never attack . 
  i doubt that its ever been seriously considered . 
  on the other hand , given the history of eastern europe , its also very understandable why they feel worried . 
  by the same token , the ` western betrayal ' ( a historical perception , not absolute fact ) does not imply a guarantee that the west would ignore the east and allow it to be consumed by moscow . 
  of the two perspectives , i would argue the ones that are currently in play ( i.e. 
  the two bullet points ) are much more influential than the perception of precedence in 1939 . 
  the greatest guarantee is the actual fucking guarantee enshrined in nato 's article v. 
  it seems not a week goes by anymore where i do n't come across the ` western betrayal ' wiki page on this subreddit . 
  two differences i can see * the west now , unlike in 1939 , is more than prepared . 
  where franco-british forces were not ready for wwii , nato is by far the world 's largest and most advanced armed forces . 
  * the west benefits from the east far more in 2014 than in 1939 . 
  by that i refer to economic interdependency . 
  there 's no question that west europe 's economy is stronger as a result of increased trade with eastern europe post-1989 . 
   juncker was not on the ballot and he had no legal standing whatsoever in the election by the same token , no uk prime minister is ever on the ballot in our general elections ( except in their own constituency ) . 
  my view is the process by which juncker became commission president is flawed and should be revisited and improved . 
  that being said , these were the rules . 
  juncker played by them and won . 
  any reform can only be implemented for the next election . 
   in the ep as a whole , sceptics have around 10 % of the votes ecr , efdd and the non-attached parties can all be described as eurosceptic ( to very different degrees of course ) . 
  together they have 170 seats , which is just over 22 % of the new parliament . 
  i completely agree its not a number that should dictate the undoing of europe . 
  on the other hand though , nor should it be ignored . 
   a common european market a common european market is one of the oldest and most fundamental goals of the european union . 
   so your corporations have an advantage and can crush the other europeans corporations/people that have to treat their workers better . 
  the uk has campaigned for an end to ` ever closer union ' for all member states . 
  a special set of terms for just the uk is not the ideal end goal . 
  and the comment about workers being treated poorly is out of place . 
  uk workers rights are not bad , nowhere close . 
   monetary the uk wants to ensure it is not forced into the euro as a consequence of remaining in the eu . 
  it also wants to ensure monetary and fiscal policy ( and all connected areas ) do not end up favouring the eurozone over the non-ez members . 
   banking regulations & financial transaction tax you 're being performative . 
  banking and financial services are the uk 's leading industry . 
  unsurprisingly , the uk wants to protect those . 
  conversely , the uk would like to deepen the single market in services . 
  the eu has not wanted to do that as yet . 
  the question then beckons , why not ? 
  this is a europe of integration . 
  so why do n't we integrate financial services ? 
   immigration this is typical unfortunately . 
  people believe the whole foreigners taking our jobs stuff . 
  it will unfortunately be a leading concession our government aims for because its a vote winner . 
   british always remained close to their ethnic anglosphere alliance and never made any concession this is n't a correlation . 
  the uk joined the eu over the commonwealth . 
  the ethnic anglosphere you refer to is now uniformly closer to the usa than it is the uk .
