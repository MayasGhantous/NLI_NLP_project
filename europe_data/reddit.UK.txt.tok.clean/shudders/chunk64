  plenty of scholars and journalists have stated how policy has played into the hands of boomers since their day 1 , and now it needs to change . 
  [ here 's one of them . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21563725 ) the error imo was how much pandering to them was made decades ago . 
  government 's that entered future debt crippling policies to appease this group in the short-term deserve to be vilified for selling out on the future . 
  i do n't blame the boomers themselves , they were n't the policymakers expected to have a knowledge of the consequences of their actions . 
  i agree with all of that tbh . 
  paxman knew not to over engage with brand because it was n't worthwhile . 
  and brand was very honest in saying there are more educated people that can and would ( hopefully ) better portray his view . 
  he seemed a little annoyed that people would n't take him seriously because he 's an actor/comedian , but did very well to at least get the ball rolling . 
  now it should be up to the political scientists / campaigners to undertake serious debate with these viewpoints . 
  i think its being overblown . 
  brand is clearly an intelligent person , but comments suggesting that he owned or destroyed paxman are wrong . 
  when paxman tried to engage brand , brand would resort to hyperbole and avoid serious answers . 
  that said , brand summarised his views very well by saying there are more intelligent people with more complete views that agree with him . 
  if people are interested in what he said , then he has the ball rolling . 
  now other people who dedicate themselves firmly to the same ideology should come forward and push those views even further . 
  then we can see those people properly debate their views with paxman etc. 
  and perhaps something can happen . 
  for a while there was talk of udar merging with tymoshenko 's party ( the second largest ) . 
  if that were done it would allow klitschko to run as the leading pro-european candidate , obviously bettering his chances significantly . 
  out of curiosity , why ? 
  personally i 'd prefer the eu to be quietly successful . 
  being no. 1 means everyone looks to you to intervene in their shit , or everyone hates you for being no. 1 . 
  the prestige is completely outweighed by the responsibility . 
  president ironfist is not a typical name for a western facing leader of a former soviet country . 
  ( dr ironfist is his boxing nickname in case people wondered where that came from ) . 
   why is unemployment a fact of life ? 
  to date the only society to have achieved ( an albeit very controversial ) full employment is the soviet union ( maybe a few other communist societies managed it , though again there 's a lot of controversy over it ) . 
  one of the major reasons for that is by forcing people down certain career paths . 
  the eu or any modern society wo n't do that as it does n't seek to be so dictatorial and it values the individual far more that the ussr ever did . 
  hence people are left to decide what career they want to pursue , which means there will naturally be highs and lows in unemployment numbers . 
   the eu spends ten times more money per cow than per unemployed youth , ( 12.7 $ versus 1.26 $ ) if the powers that be are not solving ( or even coming near ) the unemployment problem , then it is their incompetence that is killing the european dream . 
  unemployment is a fact of life for every society at some point . 
  i 'm all for what you say . 
  though i would happily bet that parliament gets to decide whether parliament gets bonuses or not . 
  i bet that would be the most attended and unanimous decision ever reached in government history . 
  perhaps a simpler metric maybe needed because of what you say . 
  numerous components could make it up , for example the number of hours spent in your constituency talking to voters and explaining policy to them . 
  perhaps bonuses just do n't work for politicians and should be scrapped . 
  the purpose of a bonus is to create an incentive for someone to do their job better . 
  they clearly do not serve this purpose at present , so unless a better way is found then they should n't exist at all . 
  this is particularly acute when its taxpayers money that is awarded to a politician because he 's gone out of his way to turn up at his place of work . 
  i was thinking that . 
  i 'd be happy for bonuses if they do their job well , like any other employee gets , but simply for turning up at brussels , their place of employment ? 
  not in england . 
  there uk and eu students all pay whatever the university 's fees are ( mostly # 9,000 but some are less ) . 
  imagine the outrage if a romanian newspaper had printed a list of all the government benefits in every eu country !, 
  but the upper-class torygraph gets away with it . 
  it depends how they swing it in negotiations . 
  they 've got the benefit of being the first microstate to enter negotiations should they decide to , which is risk free as they are n't committed to anything until they sign the papers at the very end . 
  things like equal veto powers and an disproportionate number of meps could be powerful bargaining chips . 
  a lot of nations are tax havens in their own niche way , the european ones ( not all eu ) are [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.dw.de/the-whos-who-of-european-tax-havens/a-16753202 ) i tend to agree with you , but am interested to see what they do . 
  i 'm sure their government wo n't sign away all the pros of their current status without adequate compensation somewhere along the line . 
  i thought the german unemployment benefit system was significantly stricter than the british one ? 
  this article suggests quite the opposite . 
  a normal printer can print a copy of das kapital . 
  that problem was solved a long time ago my friend . 
  minimum 6 meps per country , which would be a big number considering san marino 's population . 
  it would be very very interesting to see what sort of concessions they gain in return for reducing their number of meps to 1 or 2 . 
  of course you 're right that turkey 's application began in 1953 and thus the eu can claim to be past whether turkey is european , but practically speaking that has n't satisfied either member state politicians or the member state electorate . 
  in july 2013 [ wolfgang schaeuble ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/03/us-germany-turkey-eu-idusbre96217u20130703 ) said turkey was not european and therefore should not be part of the eu . 
  in 2002 [ valery d'estaing ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2420697.stm ) said the same . 
  sure the eu institutions are past the question of whether turkey is european , but the member states themselves are definitely not . 
  you 'd think it would be straightforward given turkey is nowhere near meeting accession requirements , but schaeuble and d'estaing felt the need to make these points nevertheless . 
   the traditional boundaries of europe are at the ural mountains and the bosphorus the problem here is that the ural 's are significantly further east than the bosphorus . 
  i agree that this has been where the europe/asia line has been drawn in the past , but it opens up a lot of problems . 
  all of turkey is west of the [ urals ] ( http://media.web.britannica.com/eb-media/41/89941-004-0962a14f.gif ) , yet the bosphorus is also a europe/asia border ? 
  they have to be considered ` european ' . 
  therein lies the debate . 
  if they can prove they are european / if they are considered european , then they can enter the eu ( provided they meet accession requirements i.e. 
  legal/social reforms etc. ) . 
  morocco once tried to enter but was told it was not [ european . 
  ] ( http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/292567752.html?fmt=abs&amp;fmts=abs:ft&amp;type=current&amp;date=jul%2021,%201987&amp;author=&amp;pub=los%20angeles%20times%20\\ ( pre-1997 % 20fulltext \\ ) & edition = & startpage = & desc = w. % 20europe % 20bloc % 20bars % 20morocco % 20as % 20a % 20member ) obviously that 's straightforward given morocco is on the african plate , but when it comes to nations such as turkey , azerbaijan , ukraine , georgia etc. , things tend to get a bit more tricky and/or controversial . 
  * is turkey european ? 
  why ? 
  why not ? 
  * who decides whether turkey is european ? 
  the eu commission/parliament etc. ? 
  european union citizens ? 
  turkish people ? 
  certainly ukip are anti-eu and not anti-europe , or at least that 's the argument they try and sell . 
  its a tough one because people often equate ` europe ' in a political sense with the eu , despite there being a million good reasons why that should n't be the case . 
  ukip for instance want to remain in nato , and have suggested increasing uk involvement in [ nato . 
  ] ( http://www.ukipbasingstoke.co.uk/ukip-policies/ukip-defence-policy/ ) unsurprisingly , they make that possible through quitting the eu and the frankly idiotic amount of money they think the eu takes from britain . 
  fwiw try not to analyse the numbers behind all this because its ridiculous . 
  just at face value they are against the eu but not europe . 
  i 'm not dutch so was n't raised with zwarte piet or anything like that . 
  perhaps the story does come from going down chimneys . 
  however , on first glance i did n't think that whatsoever . 
  here 's a picture of a [ chimney sweep kid . 
  ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/09/16/article-1312764-0b389e7d000005dc-978_468x618.jpg ) he clearly has charcoal on parts of him , but is not uniformly black like zwarte piet . 
  zwarte piet 's clothes are also oddly clean given he goes down chimneys , yet his skin is covered in charcoal ? 
  secondly , from googling zwarte piet a lot seem to have lips painted on . 
  i do n't know the story/tradition around it , but that also raised suspicions that there maybe more to this than some kid going down chimneys . 
  i 'm not trying to make an argument for or against because i do n't know enough about it . 
  just saying that upon first glance the idea that this is a white kid that 's dirty from going down chimneys does n't seem too strong . 
  he was pretty good at it [ 8 months ago ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzkfpsr8gfs ) . 
  i do n't know if this is the sort of fluency you 'd expect from someone living in germany/austria , though it seems pretty decent . 
  so just before 7 february when the new debt ceiling expires we can have this same conversation again .
