  letting one bank go bust hurts other banks . 
  again , as is hypothesised , one goes , another goes , and ultimately the house of cards collapses . 
  welcome to the party germany !, 
  iraq allegedly cost britain back in 2003 . 
  if the worst of it is being unpopular at eurovision then there 's nothing to worry about !, 
   at the moment it looks like a majority of english will vote for an exit . 
  fwiw there is correlation in [ yougov 's ] ( http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/05/07/eu-referendum-paradox/ ) polls between cameron bringing up the eu in a positive way , which he will in the event of a referendum ( as oppose to farage and his constant barraging ) and voters wanting to stay in . 
  similarly the chance of a ` better deal ' also defeats the ` out ' vote . 
  of course that 's not as concrete as people would like , but there 's a lot more the ` in ' campaign can and will do if a referendum is to happen . 
  there 's simply no reason whatsoever for them to reveal their hand yet . 
  afaik sub-prime mortgages have always been significantly riskier by the very definition of what they are . 
  through cdo 's their true risk level was effectively hidden away , which allowed for them to be sold en masse . 
  the basic logic of giving people a mortgage they ca n't afford stands as proof of that . 
  sure unpredictable events can mess up financial markets , but house prices no longer increasing imo was not that kind of event . 
  eventually prices will stop increasing , that 's a basic fact of our economy . 
  the people being paid right now did not cause the crash , namely the encouraged sub-prime mortgage trading of [ fred goodwin ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/recession/5025115/rbs-traders-hid-toxic-debt.html ) . 
  the people right now are earning a profit for their company and therefore deserve their bonus . 
  [ rbs 1st 1/4 2013 ] ( http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-2319147/rbs-shares-hit-investment-banking-arm-shrinks.html ) posted ib profits of # 294m . 
  that 's a 64 % decrease in profits due to rbs ' ib division being wound up , but that also means profits were 64 % higher in 2012 . 
  certain types of trading and investment are by definition much risker than others . 
  for example , [ junk bonds ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-yield_debt#debt_repackaging_and_subprime_crisis ) can be repackaged into cdo 's , which gives them a higher investment rating . 
  as the link describes , doing this with sub-prime mortgages turned out to be a bad idea ... [ derivatives ] ( http://business.time.com/2013/03/27/why-derivatives-may-be-the-biggest-risk-for-the-global-economy/ ) can also be dangerous . 
  [ the commission themselves ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_financial_transaction_tax#evaluation_and_reception ) expect their ftt to reduce derivative trading by up to 90 % , which you would think would be enough to safeguard europe at least against a repeat performance . 
  the fact that interest rate derivative turnover in london alone was [ $ 1.24 bn ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/currency/7976126/city-of-londons-dominance-of-forex-and-rates-markets-grows.html ) might help explain london 's objection to this . 
  other than to make non-bankers happy ( imo a completely unjustified reason ) i do n't see why this is necessary . 
  if we want to curb [ `` excessive risk taking '' ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20130225ipr06048/html/meps-cap-bankers'-bonuses-and-step-u ) legislate against excessive high risk investment , not the end salary . 
  i 'd love to see a greater than 100 % tax rate be tried on the wealthy in cyprus or greece . 
  all that means is financial centres are less likely to war with one another . 
  imo being the leading power means a certain amount of military responsibility and expectations ( all superpowers have been overwhelmingly active militaristically ) . 
  the eu is neither equipped for that nor is it willing to be so militarily active . 
  aye those poor eu employees receiving no bribes due to high salaries . 
  i can understand it if obama , cameron , or merkel accept bribes , they do n't earn nearly as much as lady ashton , barroso , or van rompuy !, 
  china overtaking the usa ( if and when ) is entirely dependent on a whole number of things , not least what is being taken as a measurement of economy . 
  i will rely on op to provide something that says under 1080 days , but as an alternative , here 's an article this month saying china wo n't do it [ this century . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/10044456/china-may-not-overtake-america-this-century-after-all.html ), 
  but for gross instability ( and whatever other unsavoury consequences you might see ) within europe to happen you would need a willingness for this within germany and amongst the german people . 
  being an economic juggernaught is a pleasant reality for germans with or without the eu . 
  the world is a wholly different place nowadays than between 1900-1945 ( not least germany is 1,000 x more pacifist ) , which makes your worries very unnecessary . 
  between that , far greater economic interdependency ( why would germany go to war given the strength of its economy anyway ) , democratic peace , nato ( irrespective of the eu ) , and if you feel like adding it a nuclear france but not germany , then a europe without the eu wo n't decline into continental warfare . 
   that and europe is potentially fundamentally unstable with an entirely independent germany ... care to explain this in the context of the 21st century and not 20th century nationalism ? 
  as i said , i do n't support this law ( and agree farage could and should diversify to include non-english brits ) . 
  the welsh speaking part of argentina comes under argentine law , so a welsh company employing someone there has nothing to do with british law . 
  that was my first thought . 
  if a majority of europeans supported a usoe then we 'd be a lot closer to it . 
  ask them how much they earn and if the financial crisis and eurozone crisis that has led to austerity throughout the continent has affected their monthly pay packet . 
  / joke , do n't ask that , it wo n't go down too well . 
  thank fuck for that . 
  i 'm glad the bundestag realised the way to stop risky trading is to cap or outlaw risky trading . 
  not the populist rubbish of [ bonus capping , ] ( http://online.wsj.com/article/sb10001424127887324030704578426543854671854.html ) which is a retarded way of stopping risky trading given you can just ban risky trading . 
  i agree that we should n't be insisting people speak english before moving here ( anywhere in the uk ) . 
  other countries do n't do that and neither should we . 
  but if we have to insist on one language being spoken by immigrants , it should be english simply because its the only common language of the entire uk . 
  in wales only [ one third ] ( http://www.north-wales.police.uk/about_us/welsh_language.aspx ) of the police speak welsh , so english is more important if you 're living there . 
  i think its a good thing to allow people to speak their regional language again , and i 'd thank the eu and post-nationalist world for it . 
  because we are n't as nationalist and forceful of a central government and culture then we are more open to people speaking their regional tongue . 
  the british government are n't worried/angry with welsh people speaking welsh because we 've realised it wo n't ruin us . 
  perhaps globalisation helps that because the welsh will benefit from retaining english as well given its global importance . 
  secondly the eu . 
  its all about inclusion and everyone being european , which creates an interesting situation that means the historic nation-state is less important ( being spanish , french , german etc. 
  is less important ) . 
  take catalonia for example . 
  some people there want complete independence from spain , yet those same people also want eu membership , despite spain also being in the eu . 
  the prospect of political union at european level really nullifies the historic issues nations/leaders have had with regionalisation . 
  the policy is that all immigrants to the uk should be able to speak english because english is the only commonly spoken language of the uk . 
  i 'm all for wales teaching children of all backgrounds welsh and the assembly having full welsh correspondence . 
  but an immigrant with full welsh proficiency and zero english abilities will be pissed off to find out that geordies do n't speak welsh when he/she applies for a job in newcastle . 
  so why do n't they ban carafe 's of wine or any wine that is not served from a closed bottle opened at the table ? 
  man 's got to pass some laws to justify [ earning more ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/docs/salary_officials_en.pdf ) money than any european head of state and the president of the united states !, 
  but , toxic oil syndrome ? 
  so your argument is that this law is relevant 32 years after the event because it could happen again ? 
  and from there the british are bribing the eu so they can criticise it ? 
  that does n't mean anything in this instance . 
  the law is there , mep 's and restauranteurs alike voiced their opinion . 
  what does the source have to do with it ? 
  toxic oil syndrome happened in 1981 . 
  either a ) its completely irrelevant , or b ) it has taken the commission 32 years to solve the problem . 
  you can decide . 
  fantastic post . 
  thank you !!!, 
   since the uk has actually been massively increasing its influence to a disproportionate level in the eu bureaucracy ( the fact that barroso did a second term and that ashton was given the high representative position being good examples ) . 
  ashton i 'll grant you . 
  i have read she was appointed in exchange for blair not becoming council president . 
  whilst we 'd all rather have ashton than blair , that 's about as justifiable as her salary . 
  what would be a disproportionate influence given britain is the [ 3rd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_population ) biggest nation ( by population ) in the eu , and accounting for july 2013 projections , the second biggest ? 
  similarly we are one of the largest net contributors to the eu , which should give us a greater influence . 
  similarly , what did britain do to get barroso a second term ? 
  i genuinely do not know the answer to that . 
  my query is on how many things britain has used its veto alone ( i.e. 
  everyone else wanted it , but britain alone vetoed it ) . 
  anything with qmv where britain is the only nation voting against counts for nothing because britain blocked nothing . 
  similarly , suggesting britain alone did something ( e.g. 
  recent budget cuts ) when it was actually a number of states is also not correct . 
  anything where britain acted alone and successfully vetoed something i fully accept . 
  there 's also talk of redefining mep constituency boundaries altogether , but from a federal perspective . 
  cutting across national borders in order to create much more effective and fair representation . 
  at present some of the mep representation differences are ridiculous , though that 's not the eu 's fault in fairness . 
  as you may well imagine this too comes from the most extreme federalists . 
  i think its idiotic fantasy myself , especially coming from such highly remunerated individuals . 
  a certain amount of devolution in light of a federal eu i fully support though . 
  its the best way to make it fairer , though it will take a hell of a lot of convincing !,
