  this makes perfect sense if we assumed germany to be using the eu solely for its own gain ( obviously all the migrants go there thus helping the german economy , whilst the rest of europe with its minimum wages get crippled on labour costs and consequent productivity decline ) . 
  i 'm sure people on here feel that way as it is . 
  * secondly it prevents worker abuse . 
  without a minimum wage competition could lead private sector wages to decrease to an absolute minimum . 
  the converse could be argued of course , that one employer offers a slightly higher wage and duly hires all the most productive staff . 
  that 's great for business , but i believe its a failure of society if that is the case . 
  * thirdly , it can be argued that no minimum wage leads to even greater disparity between workers ( remember all that 99 % / 1 % stuff last year - no minimum wage increases this ) . 
  thus minimum wages increase the quality of life for workers at the bottom ( bad for business , but a good objective for any government ) . 
  there 's a bunch of other reasons . 
  things like paying workers more means more consumption , so it helps the overall economy , and that it discourages people from entering into ` other ' sources of income ( theft , drugs , etc. 
  its the reality of the economic theory behind why a minimum wage is bad ( i 'm not saying this theory is good , just that it is demonstrated ) . 
  for the sake of debate i will follow this up : germany has little unemployment , but many of the workers at the very low end are highly unskilled . 
  germany also has more foreign workers that any other eu nation . 
  * in many cases unless foreigners speak good german they are unlikely to find a well paying job . 
  having a minimum wage would make it impossible for these people to get jobs , because a minimum wage would also raise the standard expected by the employer ( i.e. 
  you 'd pay someone $ 2 per hour if they do n't speak german , you would n't pay them $ 8 - i made up the numbers because i do n't know german wages , but it still makes sense ) . 
  * having a very low paid job is also better than no job at all for the worker because they also receive training and acquire experience . 
  this makes them significantly more employable than non-workers , and continually increases their skills ( leading to promotions and wage rises ) . 
  * upping the minimum wage increases firm labour costs . 
  quite simply , you can employ 100 on $ 1 an hour , but only 50 people on $ 2 an hour . 
  thus no minimum wage means employment will rise . 
  * unemployed people need unemployment benefit . 
  thus its better for the government to have no minimum wage . 
  even if the people work ` minijobs ' that are topped-up with unemployment benefit , this is still cheaper for the government . 
  plus these people make the company they work for more efficient and profitable . 
  therefore it also ultimately increases corporate tax revenue for the german government . 
  i do n't support this argument . 
  i 'd rather there was a minimum wage . 
  but there 's the theory behind this chart ( and german government policy ) . 
  [ here 's the list of minimum wages in europe , maybe it corresponds a little to unemployment too ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_minimum_wage ), 
  i thought it was $ 10bn total . 
  if this $ 5.8 bn unlocks a further $ 10bn from the eu/imf then the graphic is unfair to ireland . 
  ireland 's bailout was $ 85bn including the irish contribution of $ 17.5 . bn . 
  so cyprus ' should say $ 15.8 bn . 
  in the interest of fairness that is . 
  the image shows the total bailout package , including state contributions . 
  i agree with you that it would be better to remove this . 
  cyprus ' bailout is $ 10bn , which includes whatever cyprus ultimately decides to do to source its $ 5.8 bn ( though that might be $ 6.7 bn now for some reason ) . 
  the breaking news bar at the top of the bbc web site says chemical , biological , and nuclear experts have been sent to berezovsky 's home . 
  personally i think its a suicide . 
  either way this story is going to be hanging around for a good while . 
  this bit is shite :  uninsured creditors taking a 40 per cent hair cut . 
  that gets the cypriot authorities some of the way towards the $ 5.8 bn they need , or is that $ 6.7 bn ? 
  considering insured deposits are those under $ 100,000 , [ as stated here , ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-22/cyprus-approves-capital-controls-as-ministers-prepare-to-meet.html ) he questions whether a 40 % haircut on deposits over $ 100,000 would yield $ 6.7 bn . 
  everything i 've read has placed russian deposits alone as totalling $ 20bn - $ 30bn . 
  one assumed the vast majority of these deposits are over $ 100,000 ( otherwise russia would n't care as their money would be insured ) . 
  and 40 % of $ 20bn is $ 8bn , comfortably enough to cover the $ 6.7 bn . 
  and that 's only taking from russian deposits . 
  total deposits are around $ 70bn , and i highly doubt the 1.1 m people in cyprus have an average of $ 36,000 each ( covering the $ 40bn that is n't russian ) , or that russians are the only foreign account holders . 
  it seems like every possibility to criticise the eu is being taken now , regardless of whether its bollocks conjecture or hyperbole . 
  the articles heading could use a little tweaking . 
  europe in this sense means the eurozone . 
  non $ members are n't in eurogroup and hence have no say in the bailout procedure or policy . 
  i ca n't imagine russia deciding to punish a british company in response to the eurozone 's decision to impose a levy in cyprus . 
  it will certainly be interesting though . 
  this is correct . 
  i agree with you , but reminding me of this makes me angry . 
  how much fucking debt did greece manage to get itself in if $ 380bn and about 7 years later its still in ruins ? 
  and how the fuck can a country with only $ 19,342 per capita manage to get so much debt ? 
  they did , but the main source of outrage there was the 6.75 % levy , not the  $ 100,000 . 
  the interesting bit is that by more than doubling the  $ 100,000 levy ( was 9.99 % , now 20 % ) and not taxing the less wealthy accounts , cyprus will probably make more money than it would have with the 9.99 % and 6.75 % ones . 
   they did n't the same as the taliban did n't to al-qaeda up until the invasion of afghanistan then why did you say this :  americans funded the ira as well as training them and supplying them with weapons . 
  moving on , according to the [ wiki entry for al qaeda , which has some citations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-qaeda#refuge_in_afghanistan ) ( and numerous other studies on them ) , their main hq was in afghanistan and had been since 1996 . 
  one of those citations discusses the shared militancy between the two organisations . 
  thus , they were two separate bodies with some strong overlap between them ( i.e. 
  shared militancy ) . 
  the argument for training is actually not so much that the taliban trained al qaeda , but that al qaeda trained a unit of the taliban , [ brigade 055 . 
  ] ( http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,181591,00.html ) more on that can be found in this [ guardian article , ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/27/afghanistan.terrorism6 ) but to provide a couple of choice quotes :  it has been based and trained at rishikor , a former afghan army base outside kabul . 
  that clearly implies the taliban giving legitimacy to al qaeda . 
  and :  it is that part of al-qaida that appears to be exclusively dedicated to the support of the taliban those articles were written in 2001 , so perhaps there 's argument for them being politically motivated etc. 
  ( its perhaps understandable that our journalists made these connections in 2001 , even if you assert , as you are , that there was no real link between the taliban and al qaeda ) . 
  however , documents found after bin laden 's killing in 2012 have since made indisputable links between the heads of both organisations ( bin laden and omar in this case ) .

  i like it , good work . 
  if i were you i 'd consider developing it with regards to interconnectivity . 
  tone down the clusterfuckery of this [ map of railway throughout europe ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/european_railway_map.jpg ) and go from there . 
  amongst other things this shows how northern europe is more of a union than southern europe ( any topical consequences perhaps ? 
  ) , and things like its easier to get from paris to benelux/germany than it is to get to somewhere like bourdeaux ( though this is being constructed atm ) . 
  or perhaps some additional info like this [ map of railway speeds in europe . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/high_speed_railroad_map_europe_2011.svg/640px-high_speed_railroad_map_europe_2011.svg.png ) high speed railways are the newest builds of course , which suggests the future of paris is with its fellow capitals rather than the rest of france . 
  or maybe that the northern nations are upgrading already modern connections with one another rather than developing the possible dated connections with the rest of europe . 
  all these things have implications if we evaluate them . 
  these are only my opinions , but given you seem interested in combining this with the european * union * , i wondered if looking into the union part of it would be of interest to you ? 
  you could always do it for halloween then !, 
  i 'd quite like to read the comments section for exactly this reason . 
  the logic people try and come up with is startling !, 
   straightening out the kinks in the dutch economy this is where the difference is between the netherlands and spain/ireland/greece / cyprus or any of the major crisis countries . 
  there 's only some kinks . 
  the netherlands has a dynamic financial market , it has aaa credit ratings . 
  shit , the majority of the middle-clas pay a 52 % tax rate , and tax evasion is as minimal as a developed nation can expect . 
  the lack of consumer spending is the problem . 
  they wo n't come close to being ` the next euro meltdown ' or whatever people might call it . 
  edit : grammar stuff . 
  that 's because those facts are all substantiated with evidence . 
  what 's easier to understand is baseless opinion expressed with anger . 
  do n't be fooled by all those numbers my friend !, 
  quit using your logic and good reason . 
  quit it now .
