  its also not that easy when viewed from the other perspective . 
  a load of foreign migrants often leads to problems in the host country . 
  the uk is currently having these issues regarding romania , and has/had it with poles ( i.e. 
  some people do n't want them ) . 
  it sucks and it should n't be that way , we are all one eu , we are in it together . 
  but that 's sadly what happens . 
  thats not a remotely fair example . 
  greece can easily be increasing its tax evasion authorities whilst trying the elite tax evaders . 
  its not like it can only do one . 
  i fully agree with that . 
  to clarify , i have the utmost sympathy for the tax paying greeks . 
  they are really being put through hell . 
  and greek gdp is less than $ 5000 . 
  so the hit on the economy still remains . 
  i accept the elite are responsible for more , but it seems like you are discounting the value of tax evasion amongst the average people . 
  sweish tax evasion is minimal by comparison . 
  yet they still feel the need to put out this advertisement . 
  what are you trying to argue ? 
  of course you have money to defraud . 
  not as much , but the principle remains . 
  if you earn enough to pay tax then you earn enough to defraud . 
  sure one man doing it might only cost the state $ 5,000 tax . 
  but if thousands do it then it all adds up . 
  the majority of tax evasion is by the wealthy , we both agree on that . 
  do you have evidence that 80 % of a $ 28bn yearly tax evasion comes from the tiny greek elite ? 
  i believe that elite represents a disproportionate financial figure given their population , but not the extent you argue . 
  and even still , any tax evasion is wrong . 
  swedish tax evasion is minimal by comparison , yet they still advertise this . 
  why are you seemingly contending that its not that worthwhile in greece ? 
  you 're very right that the elite are responsible for more tax evasion than others . 
  in that respect i agree that more needs to be done , whatever that maybe . 
   according to a remarkable presentation that a member of greece 's central bank gave last fall , the gap between what greek taxpayers owed last year and what they paid was about a third of total tax revenue , roughly the size of the country 's budget deficit . 
  the `` shadow economy '' -- business that 's legal but off the books -- is larger in greece than in almost any other european country , accounting for an estimated 27.5 per cent of its g.d.p. 
  ( in the united states , by contrast , that number is closer to nine per cent . ), 
  [ source . ], 
  ( http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2011/07/11/110711ta_talk_surowiecki#ixzz2mq0p2z8w ) until proven otherwise i can only go from this evidence , but i doubt that the tax revenues unpaid by the ultra-wealthy account for 27.5 % gdp . 
   they found that $ 28bn ( # 22.4 bn ) of tax was evaded in 2009 by self-employed people alone . 
   as gdp that year was $ 235bn and the total tax base was just $ 98bn , it is clear that this was a significant sum . 
  at a tax rate of 40 % , it amounted to almost half the country 's budget deficit in 2008 , and 31 % in 2009 . 
   the chief offenders are professionals in medicine , engineering , education , accounting , financial services and law . 
  among the self-employed documented in the report are accountants , dentists , lawyers , doctors , personal tutors and independent financial advisers .

  of course the elite can be found in this group , but so can an awful lot more people . 
  in france tax evasion means volunteering to go to russia ... 
   the sheer scale of greek tax evasion angers the european union and imf officials trying to knock greece 's economy back into shape . 
  one recent study suggested up to $ 30 billion of revenue goes uncollected every year . 
  [ source .

   ms lagarde , now the imf managing director , has said publicly she cares more about village schoolchildren in niger than athenians `` who are trying to escape tax all the time . '' ( same article ) . 
  make what you want of ms lagarde 's statement , but greek tax evasion has caused pretty devastating effects for all of us ( greek taxpayers more than most ) . 
  the greek government should 've ran this advert years ago . 
  this article was eggscellent . 
  ftfy . 
  that was an eggsemplary article . 
  it has improved my eggspertise on this matter substantially . 
  if this man can not decide where he wants to sit in the parliament then he 's really going to struggle with actually being in government . 
  that 's not the reason it facilitates trade . 
  it facilitates trade because the single currency removes exchange rates ( which can dissuade trade depending on what country you 're in ) . 
  a few more ( theoretical ) pros : no exchanging of currency whatsoever , less red tape when transferring large sums across borders , lower interest rates for all ( remember , theoretically good ) , no hedging costs for business . 
  got that from a 1997 bbc article . 
  there 's some ( theoretical ) cons too . 
  in particular check out the first disadvantage .

  boris sums this one up well :  the london mayor said : `` brussels can not control the global market for banking talent . 
  brussels can not set pay for bankers around the world . 
   the most this measure can hope to achieve is a boost for zurich and singapore and new york at the expense of a struggling eu . 
  i 'm pro-eu and all , but this is just populist policy . 
  the vickers plan can be seen as tougher , and its clearly more realistic . 
  if banks now increase basic pay then there will be outrage too . 
  will we then limit private sector basic salaries ? 
  so grillo has a legitimate chance of taking a majority and forming a government composed entirely of m5s ? 
  that 's what i meant regarding grillo . 
  i apologise if it came across differently . 
  i 'm no expert on italian politics , but surely there is zero chance of that . 
  maybe if one of bersani/berlusconi pulls out . 
  and how is the berlusconi media dealing with all this ? 
  will monti stop running and where will his votes go ( likely ) ? 
  * bersani does n't want a vote . 
  * grillo does n't want a bersani coalition . 
  * nobody wants a berlusconi coalition . 
  so / r/europe , who 's going to give ? 
  place your bets . 
  i think berlusconi ends up in government with someone . 
  i get the feeling he would n't care , so long as he 's safe . 
  i 'm also massively confused with grillo 's position . 
  he wants to monitor government , but does n't want to enter it with anyone . 
  he 's surely not hoping to win a majority . 
  is he ? 
   the purpose of this report is to highlight information that will accentuate the magnitude of the black socioeconomic disadvantage within the u.s. 
  in general , black americans are disadvantage across various measures of economic and educational well-being .

  out of curiosity , does a mixed race us president scare you ? 
  do you feel that part of his ancestry makes him genetically susceptible to making bad decisions ? 
  if anyone is planning to comment back on this , its probably worth noting this is a guy that believes black people are genetically and intellectually inferior to the rest of the world .
