  any chance he pulls a berlusconi and very nearly ( possibly still ) returns to office in a few months time ? 
  here 's a guardian article discussing estonia and latvia , two nations that very [ successfully used austerity . 
  ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/08/estonia-latvia-eurozone-champions-austerity ) i guess the complexity is in comparing their situations to greece , italy etc. 
  what makes these nations different in a way that austerity worked for them ? 
  what did latvia/estonia ( government and populace ) do that greece/italy are not ? 
  ( i 'm not refuting zmsz btw , its a very good post . 
  just adding some examples ) . 
  an accountant 's union meeting must be the driest blandest occasion in all history . 
  i struggle to think of anything more mind-numbingly tedious . 
  it is a global thing though . 
  here 's the wiki for the [ iraqi union for accountants and auditors . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_union_of_accountants_and_auditors ), 
  beppe grillo is fast becoming very disliked outside of italy . 
  i guess the problem is silvio berlusconi is also very disliked outside of italy . 
  if the breakup of the euro was beneficial to all then i think we 'd have done it when greece was about to hold a referendum on it . 
  that led to discussion about it , but they wholly predicted bad things for everyone . 
  the euro allows europe to compete at the apex of the world economy like never before . 
  i think the issue is that it was too much too soon . 
  germany initially proposed a more close-knit euro , but of only the stronger economies ( france , gb , nl etc. ) . 
  that would 've been better because those countries were much closer economically and thus could forge a much stronger union together . 
  but that 's not the situation we are in , and we can only beat what 's in front of us . 
  the idea of it being too much too soon i think is evident through attitudes to the eurozone crisis . 
  helping greece requires weakening the german economy . 
  germany is understandably opposed to that . 
  the german-greek bond is not strong enough for that policy . 
  compare that to reunification , which too was achieved by weakening the west german economy . 
  that was done without opposition . 
  and of course it was , we non-germans can only imagine how horrid it must 've been to be separated from your compatriots ( and family ) for so long . 
  the point i 'm trying to make if that whilst european integration is a good concept , europe itself is n't personally close enough to make sacrifices like is proposed for greece . 
  i think reunification is a good opposite example to this because of course the bond amongst germans was close enough for those sacrifices . 
  my guess is that considering their current predicament , yeah the greek people would very much like to be competitive . 
  how we make them competitive is a difficult question . 
  but idly sitting by whilst they go through turmoil is n't the answer . 
  we are in a union after all . 
  you 're right its not a german vs. southern european way . 
  its about a way that 's best for the entire eu . 
  the current way is not the best for the entire eu . 
   we should n't reward failing countries by changing policies to their benefit . 
  we would n't be `` rewarding '' greece . 
  we would be using inflation to help their people move out of the mess they ( the people ) have been innocently put in . 
  and they ca n't just `` bring back their own currency '' as if it were without consequence . 
  do you remember how worried everyone was at the thought of greece leaving the euro ? 
  there 's a reason we tried to keep them in it . 
  a currency union means doing the best for everyone that 's in it . 
  that sucks for a germany that has been establishing itself a great economy . 
  but , it agreed too agreed to currency union , knowing what that entailed . 
  the rules have been changed before . 
  for instance when germany repeatedly increased [ public deficit ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4639097.stm ) in the early 2000s ( as did france ) . 
  the ultimate policy outcome of this was changing the rules of the stability and growth pact .

  you are hoping to see more elections like this ? 
  one that is seen as a threat worldwide ? 
  and regarding the ` banksters ' stuff , yeah banks are at fault a lot . 
  but do n't overlook other agents . 
  the greek government being one :  public sector wages , for example , rose 50 % between 1999 and 2007 - far faster than in most other eurozone countries . 
  the government also ran up big debts paying for the 2004 athens olympics . 
  and while money flowed out of the government 's coffers , its income was hit by widespread tax evasion . 
  so , after years of overspending , its budget deficit - the difference between spending and income - spiralled out of control . 
  moreover , much of the borrowing was concealed , as successive greek governments sought to meet the 3 % - of-gdp cap on borrowing that is required of members of the euro . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13798000 ) for the record , i 'm against austerity . 
  for anyone interested in learning some of the rationale behind the imf 's strong change of heart : [ growth forecast errors and fiscal multipliers . 
  ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp1301.pdf ), 
  there 's a third possibility . 
  the eu ( in terms of integration ) neither significantly progresses nor regresses for a while . 
  basically , certain changes happen , but the rate of integration dramatically reduces in comparison to previous eras . 
  the point of these changes is to stabilise current problems . 
  the eu is here to stay . 
  this crisis is the failure of those that did not regulate the eurozone properly and those who wanted it to be instantly as big as possible . 
  otherwise its been pretty well agreed upon . 
  its better for europe and puts it at the apex . 
  nations are n't keen for federal democracy , its too far . 
  with regards to splitting up , consider the doom mongers that existed when greece was under serious threat of being kicked out . 
  that alone was going to hurt the rest of the eu , never mind total implosion . 
  i 'm pretty sure boris johnson is n't human , and look how well he 's doing !, 
  [ london 's esteemed mayor . 
  ] ( http://alexanderfeather.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boris-yawn1.jpg?w=750 ), 
  its worth noting this is a media review . 
  so the views expressed are more that of each newspaper quoted . 
  i suppose it could be argued that quotes are always selective , so printing multiple quotes saying the same thing is effectively showing your own view ( in this case spiegel 's ) . 
  or it could be that this is an effective summary of the wider german view . 
  if grillo 's planning on hanging around he 'd better learn some governance skills ( same for silvio tbh ) . 
  if there 's one thing italy needs atm its strong government . 
  with three major groups all polling that way , strong leadership will be a bastard to achieve . 
  these hugely disparate countries need to be much closely realigned if the eu is to get back on track . 
  so long as it stays like this germany will continually fund the greek state , either slowly and expensively reawakening it , or keeping it perpetually fucked , and the greek population will continue to suffer as they are . 
  the problem with common economic policy is that all countries are different . 
  a common interest rate is set throughout the eurozone , yet the economies within the eurozone differ massively . 
  so policy is bound to benefit some and hurt others . 
  in the early days of the eurozone interest rates were set at a figure that benefitted ireland , greece , finland and belgium , but hurt germany , france and italy . 
  germany posted [ repeated public deficit levels ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4639097.stm ) that broke eu rules regarding deficit as a % of gdp . 
  you argue that the german government should seek to protect german interests , yet you also argue for a common economic policy to benefit all . 
  if the german government acts solely in its own interests then other parts of europe will suffer as a consequence . 
  inflation would benefit greece but hurt germany . 
  no inflation will hurt greece but benefit germany . 
  here 's a [ bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21496790 ) interviewing four people that chose berlusconi . 
  of course these are only four people out of a country of millions , but i guess its some reasons behind silvio 's success . 
  nice try ireland . 
  we 've all made the mistake of thinking your flag was italy .
