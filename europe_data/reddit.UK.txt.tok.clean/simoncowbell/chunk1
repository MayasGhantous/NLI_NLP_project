i moved just over 100 miles according to google . 
  it was n't across country , and certainly close enough to regularly go back , but that was more to see old friends and hang out with my sister than to visit my parents , to be honest . 
  most people * do * go somewhere else in the country , to be somewhere new , grow up a bit - but mostly because you choose the best university for your course / that you can get into , wherever it is .

  something like [ this ? 
  ] ( http://www.urban75.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/kings-cross-tube-tunnel-07.jpg ), 
  since when have londoners been known for being hospitable ? 
  even londoners think londoners are rude twats . 
  i know am one . 
  up north - quite down south - not so much, 
  kids just play with balls . 
  in terms of organised sports , cricket , rounders and rugby . 
  uncommon . 
  i cant think offhand of hearing an example of any of those . 
  most black people in the uk are of west indian origins originally , and their families have been here for 2 or 3 generations . 
  we use the term british . 
  sorry could n't hear you , too busy enjoying a lovely , lovely kinder egg . 
  is it , ` that 's enough about you , europe . 
  let 's talk about me ' time again ? 
  the interpretation of what is reasonable obviously does have a lot of background to evaluate cases against . 
  the cps ( crown prosecution service ) guidance is here http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/, 
  reasonable and proportionate force . 
  if someone tries to kill you , you kill them back if that 's what 's necessary to stop them . 
  but not if they 're just stealing your television , or if they are not a direct threat . 
  * right * is a funny word to use in this context , as clearly many people do n't have a right if they do n't meet the host countries visa requirements etc. 
  however , if they satisfy such requirements , or have some other over-riding need such as fleeing for their life , then i think so . 
  i do n't think there 's anywhere that has or advocates a policy of * completely * unchecked immigration , though that 's dependent on the employment situation in individual countries . 
  as to the ` many ' people aspect . 
  you have to place that in the context of how much the rabble-rousing-rightwing press , e.g. 
  the daily mail has demonised immigrants . 
  but not just just from the developing world , ( i said this in an answer to something on brexit a couple of days ago , so apologies for repeating myself ) - scare stories about poles , romanians and bulgarians coming over here and both ` stealing our jobs ' and ` living in luxury on unemployment benefits ' at the same time , have been a staple of ukip and aforementioned daily mail . 
   it 's looking more and more like uncontrolled migrant immigration is not only a cultural and safety burden for the member states , but it 's creating an economic and human capital bubble that 's going to pop very soon . 
  meaning that the number of unskilled migrants that will be reliant on state services ( of varying degrees , some but very little assistance , some with a lot ) will overwhelm the services and economic systems of these countries . 
  just no , that 's all scare-mongering daily mail nonsense . 
  nothing is going to pop . 
   would the uk not benefit from leaving the eu to at least have more of say in the number of migrants that immigrate ? 
  that is a large part of the ukip and brexit programme , but it 's not been the recent refugee situation that initially fuelled this , it was the opening of borders to eastern european countries - press reports like the ones discussed here - - http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/mar/17/dailymail-pcc  more non-european immigrants means less jobs for natives and more strain on the social systems , but they ignore this idea when it comes to the eu and the potential for millions of unskilled migrants . 
  no , as i said , scare stories about poles , romanians and bulgarians have been the bread-and-butter of the right-wing gutter press . 
   does this not set the stage for eventual european wars between dissident nationalist groups within countries and across states lines within the eu ? 
  if it all goes tits up , maybe that could happen in a hundred years time , but it 's not something i have any expectation of seeing in my lifetime . 
   is it worse than i thought ? 
  i do n't know how it could be worse than your apocalyptic scenario , short of adding zombies  am i completely bonkers ? 
  just lay off the daily mail , that festering pile of misinformation and paranoia would drive anyone round the bend ,, 
  same as i felt a month ago https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4g27xk/what_are_your_opinions_on_american_military/, 
  crime rates have been falling for 20 years . 
  there has been some suggestion that it 's edged up slightly , by 2 % , [ but that 's generally attributed to cuts in services ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/after-falling-for-nearly-20-years-recorded-crime-rates-are-edging-back-up-again-10314624.html ), 
  it 's not really a thing . 
  people commit suicide in european countries , but it does n't have the traditional tie to ` loss of face ' or ` shame ' that exists in some asian countries . 
  the suicide thing is awful , but in the uk , bosses feeling some sense of shame would be a big improvement - i 'm looking at you [ philip green ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia ), 
  aurstalia is n't a socialist country . 
  class-based - remind me who your head of state is ?

  diy is very popular in the uk . 
  and gardening . 
  and sports - watching or doing - going to the cinema , to gigs , to theatre shows . 
  going to restaurants , bars , cafes , pubs , nightclubs .

  this is what estate agents do in england , wales and northern ireland .

  https://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/estate-agent and this is how to buy or sell your house https://www.gov.uk/buy-sell-your-home/overview, 
  my british take on these writers . 
  i 'd assume americans writers are better known here than in other parts of europe , because of using the same language . 
  twain 's known for tom sawyer and huckleberry finn , but not really for anything else . 
  poe is well known by anyone who has an interest in the horror genre , i 'd say . 
  of the writers you referenced i 'd say he was the best known and most popular and the one most likely to be read for pleasure , not just because it was part of a class . 
  hawthorne - less so , maybe for the scarlet letter , but that is n't well-known . 
  melville is known for moby dick , but that does n't have anything like the interest or importance that it does in the american literary canon . 
  walt whitman - much less well-known . 
  i 'm only vaguely aware that he was a poet and could n't name anything by him . 
  hard to recommend anything like twain without knowing what books by him you like , but other 19th century british authors that are well-read and regarded thomas hardy - ( a favourite of mine ) , george eliot , charlotte bronte, 
  anywhere that sells hair dye . 
  if the usual range in your supermarket does n't satisfy you , trendy cereal cafes with lots of imported options are springing up in hipster areas http://now-here-this.timeout.com/2015/05/14/the-cereal-killer-cafe-has-just-opened-a-second-branch-in-camden/, 
  the military bases in the uk get protested against and the ability of them to be used for military action against targets we have no say in , may be against our interests but which in turn makes the uk a target for retaliation . 
  i believe some have had protests outside every single week since they started . 
  however , the people who live near them generally very much want them to stay . 
  not for any defence reasons , but because they are in out of the way places , with no other industry or trade , and communities around them make money out of them . 
  ( also , the bases are in europe to protect * you * not us , i know there 's a rabble of ` murca types on reddit who do n't get that , they 're strategic bases to act in america 's interest ),

  please americans , stop asking this fucking question !, 
  nobody is as obsessed with you as you are !, 
  slightly surprised it 's getting such a good reception here , i think it 's an awful idea . 
  there 's no mechanism or structure to establish anything like this democratically , and the ability for the big economic powers - obviously germany comes to mind - to steamroller through policies that suit them would have no buffer . 
  europe is n't a country . 
  i 'm like to see more localisation , more devolved authorities , more being decided by the grass roots , not less . 
  the only people i 've heard use the term are bobby jindal , donald trump and steve emmerson, 
  yes , it 's safe , yes it sounds stupid , no you should n't cancel it . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4brc7v/have_a_trip_planned_in_2_months_and_now_family_is/ https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/4brapw/western_europeans_how_do_you_feel_about_the_way/, 
  it would be a very stupid way to behave regardless of whether there 's a criminal charge . 
  in a crowded situation , you could easily mistake an inadvertant nudge for something it 's not . 
  and if you 're punching hard enough to knock them out , you could kill them . 
  but also , i 've lived in london for over 30 years . 
  i 've never had my pocket picked or ever heard of anyone i know having their pocket picked . 
  instead of fantasising about being crocodile dundee , just keep an eye on where your belongings are and use some common sense . 
  i had no idea europe was being portrayed like that .
