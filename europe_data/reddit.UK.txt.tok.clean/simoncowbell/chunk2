  it 's bollocks , but if a load of racist scardey-cat yanks want to belive a load of fairy tales , it ' s their loss . 
  they 're the ones living in ignorance , no skin off my nose . 
  ( on the immigration part , i 'm going to copy and paste a reply i gave to a question on immigration about a week ago in askuk ) to understand immigration to the uk , you have to go back to windrush generation from the caribbean and similar post-war immigration from the indian sub-continent one of the most annoying things about reddit is the way the worldnews crowd and similar , assume that anybody with a brown skin or a name that is n't anglo-saxon , must have come here last year , rather than it 's likely that their grandparents , or even great-grandparents , were the immigrants . 
  even when i was a student , people drank out of glasses first , with a back up of plastic cups for when they ran out . 
  beers are mostly drank from the bottle or can anyway . 
  now i 'm a bit older , definitely glasses , hire them for a big party from your wine merchant - they take them back dirty and they wash them . 
  however , plastic for an all-outdoors party are more acceptable , because of the higher risk of breakages . 
  it 's always been a political football . 
  the nhs is huge ( fifth largest employer in the world ) , has a high profile , is constantly under scrutiny , whilst also being something britain is very proud of . 
  plans for the nhs always form a large part of any election campaign . 
  all the cheeses !, 
  actually i 'm trying to cut down so at this precise moment i only have 2 cheeses in the house - emmantel and port salut . 
  cheddar , obviously , is the standard multi-purpose cheese , being in britain . 
  cheshire and caerphilly are 2 more of my favourite british cheeses . 
  and sage derby - had n't had it for ages but got some a couple of weeks ago - must get some more !, 
  and stilton for a blue cheese . 
  i 'm also very fond of manchego , taleggio , parmesan - ( not in a shaker , have some self-respect ) , camembert - a baked camembert is lovely !, 
  and goat cheeses - we get some nice goat cheese in british supermarkets, 
  that was a really strange poll result . 
  cromwell is pretty much seen as a villain here , the man who banned christmas and obviously hated in ireland . 
  either people who voted for him were taking it as ` someone who influenced the country significantly ' rather than someone they approved of , or the poll was brigaded by hard-line northern ireland orangemen . 
  he is definately not generally seen as a hero, 
  reddit is the worst place to get an idea on the state of racism . 
  stormfront specifically targeted r/europe some time ago , and they set up camp and have been difficult to get rid of . 
  / r / european is a stormfront outpost , pure and simple . 
  and do n't be taken in by it 's name - it 's a racist dogwhistle . 
  it refers to european heritage , meaning ` white ' , it 's a sub about white rights , not europe . 
  the thing about political heroes from past times , is that they tend to also have something unacceptable from outdated attitudes in their background . 
  so winston churchill is a hero in britain for his war-time leadership and speeches , but go back further into his political career and some racist attitudes raise their head . 
  from history other notable figures - in no order whatsoever - are lord nelson , florence nightingale , elizabeth i , charles darwin , nye bevan ( founder of the nhs ) . 
  and of course , our writers , - it 's 400 years since shakespeare 's death this april and there are lots of events this year around that . 
  more specifically the heroes of my home town , london would be charles dickens , the architect christopher wren , joseph bazalgette , ( known for giving london it 's sewers ) , and probably harry beck , who devised the schematic underground map . 
  i do n't eat crumpets , i 've never said ' u wot m8 ' , i do n't adore the queen , there 's nothing wrong with my teeth , i know that the nhs is paid from taxation , nobody took any guns away from me , and there are no no-go sharia law areas . 
  yes , yes , we have fire . 
  in fact we have a night every year when everyone in the country ( slight exaggeration , but pretty much everyone ) does that . 
  strangely enough , it 's commonly known as [ bonfire night ] ( http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/guy/england.htm ), 
  family holidays abroad are quite common these days , so many children go on a trip abroad once a year , maybe to spain , or france , or anywhere with a nice beach really . 
  florida is also a popular holiday destination for british families . 
  in school , in the early years i remember there was often a project to look at different aspects of a country , similar to you - it seemed quite random what country was chosen , i remember japan being one . 
  when the topic of changing the national anthem , or of england having an anthem , ( both of which come up quite often ) , the ` usual suspects ' as alternative anthems are * rule britannia * * jerusalem * ( the william blake poem ) * land of hope and glory * and maybe * i vow to thee my country * * there 'll always be an england * - this one is a bit more modern , as it 's a ww2 song, 
  can we * please * have questions about europe , not endless ` what do you think of this american thing ', 
  i do n't know that many cartoons about cutting throats , or ripping from mothers breasts or blood soaked fields, 
  the french have got this one beat - hands down no contest . 
  they 've got the most rousing , tuneful and scariest anthem in the world . 
  it used to be done by vote , i think it 's gone from one method to the other and back again . 
  we still keep getting nul points :-(, 
  someone asked on askuk not long ago which commonwealth country british people felt was culturally / socially , most like britain and new zealand was the majority answer by a long chalk . 
  ca n't argue with that . 
  here 's that thread https://www.reddit.com/r/askuk/comments/3yoeiy/what_commonwealth_nation_is_most_like_the_uk/, 
  i did n't vote for the party in power , and do n't agree with most of their policies , so not particulalry as an individual . 
  however ,  i 've seen a number of europeans complaining about their democratic representation i 've seen a number of people from every democratic nation do the same - canada , usa , australia , that 's in the nature of democracy , it is it 's strength actually , that we all feel free to criticize and that our opinion is worth something, 
  does n't this get asked every week ? 
  nobody thinks about the usa as much as you think about how people think about the usa . 
   are the political spectrums in europe more to the right or left ? 
  western europe , to the left . 
  quite a lot to the left compared to the usa . 
   how are concepts like nationalism or patriotism viewed in the uk , appropriate for sporting occasions , ( and to put on a bit of a camp show for tourists when there 's a royal shindig on ) , otherwise , deeply embarrassing and a bit distasteful . 
   in contrast to how the european union is viewed we 're a bit ambivalent about that in the uk . 
  but even it 's greatest supporters do n't have a patriotic-type regard for it . 
   given the past various conflicts few years , do you believe the e.u. 
  will last ? 
  yes . 
  i 've never considered tattoos as an american thing . 
  common enough in london , especially in the more hipster areas . 
  some of them look nice . 
  some not so much . 
  it takes all sorts . 
  i 've been an alt country fan for years - son volt , uncle tupelo , bottle rockets , freakwater etc. 
  it gets pretty lonely at times :-(, 
  can we have a bit of a moritorium on the agenda questions , please . 
  this sub is turning into / r/tellmeyouhateimmigrantsiknowyouwanttoreally but as you asked - in the uk the only cases i can think of recently od people actually being prosecuted for refusing to serve gay people in their business , or offer the same service that they do to everyone , have been fundamentalist christians, 
  as a kid - `` cross my heart and hope to die '' - which is very morbid for children , now i stop and think about it . 
  when stormfront is taking over the site , and it is trying to , mods and admins * should * get involved . 
  the racists take over , the non-racists give up and go away . 
   for people to say how they really feel racists should be made to feel very ashamed and embarrassed , not upvoted . 
  well , they do n't , but even so do they go to ask it in askanamerican ? 
  does n't look like it to me . 
  this is supposed to be a sub about europe, 
  reddit has a proplem with racism , it 's been targeted again and again by organised far-right brigades , and the admins are only just making thoroughly inadequate moves against it . 
  if i believed that reddit accurately depicted american racism , then i 'd think that americans went round openly talking about much they hate niggers and kikes . 
  as i work with americans , i know thy 'd be completely outraged by the sort of racism and xenophobia that gets upvoted on reddit , and so would 99 % of the europeans i 've met . 
  `` but that 's enough about europe . 
  tell me about america , askeurope '', 
  there are examples of people who are just organising stuff themselves , not in any of the known big named charities . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2015/aug/14/calais-migrant-how-grassroots-groups-are-helping[1] there are a few links in that article to facebook pages and kickstarter/crowdfunding pages that could give you some people to get in contact with . 
  from there it 's up to you to decide whether they seem like people who know what they 're doing / are trustworthy etc. 
  this is being asked every other day now , try reading some of those threads https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/3h42wx/what_are_your_honest_thoughts_on_immigration/ https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/3irfpb/whats_your_opinion_on_the_refugee_crisis/ https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/38b1i9/why_do_you_have_to_take_mass_numbers_of_immigrants/  the problem is , the only people i see sharing similar values and fears as myself seem to be far-right , racist , neo-nazi , etc. 
  types , and that scares me , yeah , you should probably take a look at yourself . 
  the thing i like about this sub , is that it 's not succumbed to the organised brigading from the far-right that other europe-centric reddit subs have been plagued by . 
  it 's burgundy, 
  your issue is n't ` european people ' - who mostly are n't racist - it 's ` the regulations of the country you arrive in ' . 
  i do n't think your case stands a chance of satisfying the requirements to claim asylum , unless you can prove that you have gone to your police / government for help and they are categorically refusing to help you because of your race , sexual orientation , political opinion or religion . 
  if they specifically say formal , jeans and sneakers wo n't get you through the door . 
  and you should wear a jacket . 
  not always the most cheerful people in the word . 
  yes , it 's 9 words , i 'm british , i 'm being polite . 
  my honest view is that my country is largely responsible for fucking up their countries over hundreds of years , so it ill behoves us to behave like pricks when they want to come over and work and pay taxes and and improve our food . 
  `` but that 's enough about you , europe . 
  tell me what you think about america '', 
  i think part of it , is knowing how to eat it .
