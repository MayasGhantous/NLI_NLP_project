  i 've seen people slathering a thick layer on , then taking a huge bite and grimacing . 
  a little marmite is delicious , a lot is too much of a good thing . 
  no , but i live in london . 
  the appeal of it passes me by , but i do n't have much of a sweet tooth . 
   also , do you regularly eat peanut butter ? 
  not , regularly , no , but occasionally . 
  it 's widely available . 
  when i have toast my spread of choice is a good west country butter , and a smear of marmite ,, 
  why are you asking people in a different continent ? 
  why are you expecting us to know or care ? 
  do n't vote for parties you do n't like , support ones you do , is the only thing anyone can tell you . 
  for fucks sake , try to make a question in askeurope at least * vaguely * about something in europe . 
  no , but i think the problem is that it 's a widely held misconception - hence people with no documents think they 'll be fine in the u.k. . you need a passport or driving licence to rent a flat , get a job , open a bank account , pick up a parcel etc etc etc. 
  sure , there 's a black economy where people duck and dive under the grid - but that 's the same in any european country, 
  `` but that 's enough about you , europe , tell me what you think about me '', 
  there are no true brits either , we 're celtic viking roman french mongrels , we can take a few more nationalities , who gives a fuck maybe we 'll get a generation that does n't burn as soon as the sun comes out . 
  how do you lose a country , leave it in the north sea and forget where you put it ? 
  people who want to come here and work , and make a future are very welcome in my book , wherever they started out from . 
  ignorant vile racist morons like the edl and bnp can get in the fucking sea . 
  [ you.don ` t.say ] ( http://i1124.photobucket.com/albums/l562/nidien200/tumblr_mc23hpcsrd1r3zat8.jpg ) but please do n't let my little sarcasms give you the impression that us yooropeens are n't really grateful to have a couple of americans posting in askeurope to tell us all about our countries . 
  everybody else who replied is * in * europe . 
  and if you read the replies , from the people who actually live in a variety of different countries in europe , you 'll learn that it 's much more nuanced than that . 
  also your spelling is awful - it 's europe , not yurop , the american education system is quite disgraceful, 
  hey . 
  we 've got ourselves an american troll , can we keep him , he 's funny :d, 
  in the u.k. we have a state religion , and bishops sitting in the second chamber , and yet bringing ` god ' into public debate is seen as a bit ` off ' . 
  it 's seen as a very personal thing , and in many ways as slightly suspect . 
  for a politician , being publicly an atheist is a lot less potentially damaging than professing a strong belief in a religious faith . 
  if i had to characterise the religious attitude of the u.k as a whole ( which obviously is a broad generalisation ) , i 'd say it 's agnostic - there 's a distrust of people being publicly vocal about their belief or non-belief . 
  we have god in our national anthem , though nobody really thinks god is protecting the queen , like it when the archbishop of canterbury tells the tories off for not looking after the poor - but keeping voting tories in ( yeah , i do n't know why we keep doing that ) . 
  we like the hymns and carols and the church buildings , as long as nobody * actually * expects us to believe in all the god stuff, 
  we read tom sawyer and huckleberry finn at school , in the uk . 
  i 'd say he was very well known for those 2 books, 
  it 's very bad . 
  i tried to work out where he was coming from , his channel seems to be some kind of homoerotic viking fantasy slash stuff . 
  not my cup of tea , all a bit tom of finland, 
  uk - a niche sport , though probably more popular to play than as a spectator sport . 
  after football , the most popular sports are cricket and rugby, 
  well , i 've got you tagged as a racist , so maybe they mistook you for part of the stormfront brigading that they get a lot of . 
  try sending the mods a message explaining that you 're not . 
  i 've got a degree in history and a phd , and no , nobody has ever been either rude or ignorant enough to either laugh or frown at me because of it . 
  it 's never crossed my mind that anyone would , it 's a respectable academic discipline . 
  surely the uk has more in common with with france culturally than with iceland , and has had for the last thousand years at least . 
  entirely agree with fuchsiamatter , it 's silly , you 're just making arbitrary distinctions based on your own opinion . 
  in the uk - very . 
  most families are 2 car families . 
  it 's less prevalent in major cities , i live in london , and people here really only feel the * need * to have a car after they have children . 
  but you only have to see the amount of traffic ( and the school run traffic ) to see that it 's very common . 
  tourists are often carrying around more money than the average working guy/girl which does make them a target . 
  and they 're also trying to take in lots of things at once , in an unfamiliar place , in a crowd . 
  i live in london , and never give it much thought , but i see tourists doing really stupid stuff - putting bags down then marshalling their friends into a photo , pushing their luggage halfway theough a luggage barrier in the underground then leaving it there as they go to find someone , putting a phone down on a bar and walking away from it . 
  people ( all of us ) get a bit giddy on holiday and do dumb stuff, 
  not do - stand in the way , particularly in tube corridors and on platforms during rush hour . 
  all those people rushing round you are trying to get to / from work , if you block up entrances and exists , they ca n't likewise , stopping dead in groups in the middle of a street . 
  also - why do you need to be dragging a wheeled suitcase around with you * everywhere * - on the way to your hotel - fair enough - but * shopping on oxford st ? 
  * - why ? 
  and - you *** can *** pick them up , in busy places , like the tube again , you do n't have to have them trailing 12 inches behind you tripping up and banging into the shins of everyone whose path you cross . 
  * and breathe *, 
  you know who has a buzzcut in the uk ? 
  every other man who is starting to lose his hair . 
  it 's very , very common . 
  do n't feed the trolls , you 've just brought yourself down to his level . 
  people tip in restaurants in britain . 
  they do it now , i 'm sure they did it in the 1920s . 
  threads on tipping on reddit get very silly , people tip about 10 % in restaurants , however , if it 's already in the service charge people might think it 's covered enough , and you would n't tip if the service was bad . 
  the major difference is that now we have minimum wage laws , so waiting staff have to be paid at least that , you ca n't employ a waiter and tell him that he only gets paid in tips . 
   `` it 's so green !, 
  it 's so green ! '', 
  whilst looking amazed out the window . 
  oh come , you 're just being curmudgeonly , that 's rather sweet !, 
  if you come from somewhere like nevada , i bet it is amazing . 
  being american is n't special . 
  just behave like a normal polite human being . 
  a lot of people on reddit * do n't * say they hate immigration , but you do n't see people posting to say they 're not complaining about a thing . 
  and reddit has been systematically targeted by stormfront to promite racist ideas . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/2wxdut/edward_snowden_writes_an_impromptu_manifesto_on/cova8pg they have an actual programme they call swarmfront . 
  reddit in general is not a good barometer of views on race and immigration . 
  in the uk we have historical links to those places , and frankly , have some - in certain cases , a lot - of responsibility for those places being war-torn . 
  and ` importing ' is such a horrible term - they are n't spare parts being shipped in . 
  yes , it 's where the posters who got banned from / r/europe for being outright nazis went to . 
  the influx outright nazis being a result of being targeted by stormfront http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1w3fnr/seems_we_are_important_enough_for_stormfront_to/, 
  you mean that entire one other post on islam ? 
  i ca n't answer for sweden , i 've never been there and i know better than to trust one sensationalised report . 
  i do know that it 's not true in london , a group of idiots tried it for a week , got reported to the police , arrested and given jail time . 
  but because they put up 5 minutes of youtube video 2 years ago , people ( like you ) keep pointing to it and saying `` aha - a no-go zone where moslem teenagers enforce sharia law '' when it 's `` aha - shortly after that they got 6 month sentences for threatening behaviour '' as for the answers in the thread being anecdotal - yes , they 're accounts from people who are actually living in those places , now . 
  some of the places named are the parts of london known to have a high percentage of moslem residents , and the anecdotes are from people who are in those areas every day saying `` it 's not a no-go zone , i live there , it 's fine '', 
  long thread on this in / r/london tl : dr - no . 
  www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/2t1cfh/londoners_what_is_the_truth_are_there_nogo_zones/  people are protesting too much no , they 're correcting a very stupid , but very dangerous , lie . 
  if americans think the second largest city in the uk is a radical muslim stronghold , next thing you know , they ' l be bombing it . 
  what country ? 
  what city ? 
  in london - they 've stopped in the middle of the street / entrance to the tube . 
  yesterday a group of about 15 italian teenagers had stopped to have a chat on the pavement where a pelican crossing was on a major busy road . 
  just stopped on it . 
  in everybodys way . 
  even stephen fry would get told to fuck off he came up with a line like that . 
  the whole idea is weird . 
  do n't do it , people will think you 're a creep . 
  what exactly to you intend to do with these cards ? 
  memorize them ?
