  show them to people ? 
  whichever it is , what are you going to do when they respond , as you ca n't understand what they say ? 
   `` you are very cute , and if i was younger , spoke the language better , and much , much braver , i would ask you for a kiss . '', 
  there is no country in the world , or any language , where you can say that and not get told to ` fuck off ' - possibly in english or the local equivakent . 
  it 's possible to get hired for low skilled jobs that require no particular knowledge or experience . 
  such jobs will be badly paid and probably not very pleasant - cleaning jobs , basic labouring jobs where you are literally just used to carry and move things etc , basic farm labouring jobs , where you are hand picking crops for hours on end etc, 
  depends what site i 'm on , on reddit , depends what sub i 'm on . 
  i know there are a lot of people on reddit who are n't american , some of my favourite subs have a lot of australians ans canadians posting . 
  tl : dr - i do n't make an assumption . 
  there are quite a few churches in london that have a regular programme of free lunchtime music - st martin-in-the-fields in trafalgar square is probably the best known for this , st. james 's piccadilly has them too , and st olaves in the city, 
  oh lordy - that last night of the proms thing is the cringiest thing . 
  i 've never come across anyone before who did n't just want to disown it entirely :-( (, 
   small pocket knives/pepper spray/baton/tazers ? 
  the last 3 - completely illegal in the uk . 
  as a camper a knife that is appropriate for doing camping-type things will be fine , like a swiss army knife , but anything ` weapon ' like - no . 
  but as user/pfdwxenon says , your whole approach is bizarre , you do n't need weapons , you 're not entering a war zone . 
  it is extremely hard to get a work visa for the uk , it 's really not a viable option unless you already know that you have some way of getting one . 
  are we back to having every second question about america ? 
  i 'm disappointed . 
  that seemed to have stopped for a bit . 
  can somebody start / r/tellmeaboutamerica for these questions , i do n't think they belong in a sub that is supposed to be about europe . 
  you are extremely naive if you think all 50 year olds are executives and managers . 
  you 've never seen a 50 year old janitor , factory worker , manual labourer ? 
  look around , there are a lot of them about . 
  but even on your argument - it 's not that 19 year olds will step into the 50 year old jobs - having people stay in a company at an older age stagnates the whole process of promotion and recruitment within companies , particularly at times of recession and high unemployment when there are n't enough new jobs being created to be filled by those that want them . 
  if the 60 year old does n't retire than the 45 year old under him does n't get promoted , and the 30 year old under him does n't and the 20 year old under him , so the junior job is n't vacant . 
  as for unemployment benefits - i do n't know the system in the netherlands , but i think in many , if not most , parts of europe , there is a correlation between how much you can claim and what taxes / national insurance when you were working , that seems fair to me - a base rate that allows all umemployed people to live decently , and people who have worked and paid taxes , get some of that back when they lose their job . 
  and access to retraining to help them into work . 
   1 ) realizing that there is a bad bridge between school and employer just because there is barely connection between it . 
  i ' l pass on this , i do n't understand it , i do n't know about the german system  2 ) knowing that the pension in some countries in the eu are relatively low if you compare it with the average lifetime of a person in that country causing the country too much money to spend to the people who have retired ( too early ) . 
  we think it 's better to make it higher but i dont know how high and what the best solution about this is . 
  hope i can get some help with this . 
  here in the uk the retirement is being raised - it ; s happening in stages , but as discussed it is intended to be raised to 70 . 
  i do not think this is a good solution . 
  if older people are staying in their jobs longer , it means fewer jobs open for younger people . 
  also , although people are staying healthy for longer , we have not cured all effects of age . 
  do you have relatives in their 60s and 70s ? 
  they get arthritis , their hearing and sight deteriorates , some get dementia . 
  and working for 50 years until you drop - what a grim fucking prospect . 
  do you want that to look forward to ? 
   3 ) noting that its very attractive to stay in the subvention causing eu spending too much money to unemployees . 
  this is really a pain-in-europe-ass problem . 
  but how can you solve it ? 
  the only thing we think is forcing them to find work just giving them very little money . 
  but how much ? 
  we cant let them die and we still mustnt let them benefit from it . 
  force them to find work ? 
  what work ? 
  the number who are ` voluntarily ' unemployed is small compared to the majority who want to work but ca n't get a job . 
  nobody can be sure that their job is secure nowadays - think about how you 'd want to be treated if you could n't get a job straight after leaving education , ot were made redundant from your job . 
  would punishing you help?i think not . 
   4 ) claiming that women are forced to make the decision wether working a full time job or making a family , causing most of them dont want children anymore making the gap between old and young people bigger . 
  to be honest , i dont understand why my team thinks this is a problem and i dont even know this is true or not . 
  besides of that , they can do part time jobs cant they ? 
  i got countered by saying there is little part time job compared with full time ( in a company ) . 
  hope you guys can help me with it and already thanks to people who wan na help me , better affordable child-care would be an all round good thing . 
  i do n't know of any evidence that women are stopping having children because of the lack of it , but there is a tendency to have children later , not necessary a bad thing . 
  the ` no part-time work ' thing is complete rubbish . 
  there are advantages to companies to hire part-time workers - it wo n't be the same in all eu countries , but certainly in the uk employers can take on part time workers who are below the threshold of having to pay things like national insurance for , and do n't have all the employment protection of a full-time worker . 
  depends on where you are coming from . 
  if you 're from canada - you 'll find it quite mild in all those places . 
  if you 're coming from hawaii , yes , you 'll find it very cold . 
   will it be a problem for us to take each city in given the weather no , those are all tourist destinations and people visit and enjoy all those places in the winter . 
  ( okay , london grinds to a halt if it snows , but that 's really only the things that effect people getting to work , central and tourist areas are generally fine , plus we have n't had serious snowfall in december for a couple of decades if not longer ), 
  get over yourself - this question gets asked regularly . 
  the subs called ` askeurope ' , you could ask a question and learn about anything about a different country , but no , you do n't know want to know about anyone else `` what about meee ??!!! '',

  uk - it 's a bit of a mix . 
  we roll out the flags and get all patriotic over a royal event , or a sporting occasion . 
  but most of the time , it 's seen as a bit embarrassing to even admit to * liking * your country . 
  also flag-waving in the most literal sense has been associated with far-right and/or anti-immigration political groups . 
   the uk still has a higher violent crime rate ( per 100,000 people ) than the us actually it does n't , this rubbish keeps being trotted out by people who do n't understand how to interpret comparative statistics . 
  fact in the uk statistics a wide range of offences are counted as violent including threats of violence where no actual assault has taken place . 
  fact in the us statistics a much narrower range of offences are considered as violent crimes which only involve actual assault . 
  fact facts are fun !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  but only if you understand what facts are . 
  actually i was thinking more of the fact that there are around 80 school shooting incidents per year . 
  look , someone came to an askeurope reddit and asked what we think . 
  mostly we think your laws on guns are mad . 
  your replying to every comment with `` only a few children actually get blown to bits '' makes it sound even more mad . 
  in your country , you can have whatever laws you want ; it 's not for anyone else to tell you what you should do . 
  but if you ca n't frame gun laws that keep your children safe , at some point , do n't you start to think that you 're doing something very very wrong ? 
  as for the nra - the most cynical organisation on the planet `` our children are being killed - buy more guns , we can sell more guns - guns for children , guns for teachers buy buy buy !! '', 
  yes , love , you 're too clever for us , nobody took you for a half-arsed troll at all , with your over-obvious thowaway name , no other posts and silly over-worked rant * tousles little troll 's head *, 
  and yet probably has the most diverse ethnic / nationalities mix in europe by far - why do you say that it 's not welcoming ? 
  edit ah - just looked at your past comments , you 're all about the trolling i see . 
  the threads that ask about how things are different across europe , and get people from different countries contributing are a great read - threads like these [ do you think that mandatory military service is a good idea ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/1vdbjy/do_you_think_that_mandatory_military_service_is_a/ ) [ what is one internationally uncommon food from your country that everyone should try ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/1v67h0/what_is_one_internationally_uncommon_food_from/ ) [ how does the healthcare system in your country work ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/1tbbzg/how_does_the_healthcare_system_in_your_country/ ) [ what is your favourite european movie ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/1t75bc/what_is_your_favourite_european_movie/ ) maybe you could borrow a bit of the tactic used in redditdayof and get people to suggest topics for threads like those , and promote upcoming topics in the sidebar . 
  i 'd certainly prefer to see fewer `` but that 's enough about europe , tell me what you think about america '' threads , as i 've said before . 
  maybe add a reminder to the sidebar that this sub is an opportunity to learn about different countries , not just see your own reflection . 
  `` but that 's enough about europe . 
  tell me what you think about america '', 
  we have n't had any here in the uk since the 1960s . 
  occasionally some tory type will call for the return of national service to smarten up the youth / deal with youth unemployment but it 's got no real support . 
  one of the main opponents of the idea is actually the army , who really do n't want a load of untrained unmotivated oiks that they have to babysit for a year or so - there 's just nothing useful for people like that to * do * in the modern british army . 
  can we have fewer questions about america in askeurope , and more actually about europe , please . 
  when immigration is an issue , it 's usually in the context of * mass * immigration , points in history when a large number of people have immigrated , such as when eastern european countries joined the eu and had the right to live and work in western europe .
