  how would you anglicise the spelling of smidir\u00edn\u00ed so i could pronounce it ? 
  ... and they said it * a lot * . 
  thanks for doing the homework !, 
  go on , then . 
  it 's your claim , back it up !, 
  it 's language , just usage . 
  in the uk we use mm or cm , never dm . 
  it leads to strange things , such as an oven i was looking to buy being measured as 550mm wide . 
  there 's your foot . 
  it 's funny , it 's a real proof that the measurements you grow up with impact the way you think . 
  my parents use miles , yards , feet and millimetres . 
  i use miles , metres , cm and mm . 
  we 're a confused lot , us brits . 
  i 'd love to see the statistics on this, 
  [ so you know what to look out for in pubs or corner shops ] ( https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/njawwdywma==/z/xvwaaoswr~lysu9l/$_58.jpg ) . 
  best of all , they come on cardboard hangers [ like this ] ( https://www.britishcornershop.co.uk/img/large/clen1272.jpg ) . 
  yeah we do . 
  those frazzles that are better than frazzles that you normally only get in pubs . 
  so what you are saying is that thanks to post-soviet russia , world dominates you ? 
  the people of / r/keto welcome you . 
  i believe most euro-sceptic britons believe that leaving the eu would n't force us to leave the eea . 
  if we 're part of the eea like iceland , liechtenstein and norway , we could still benefit from the single market . 
  i 'm not sure i buy it myself , but i can see it being allowed for the short-term . 
  the question would be whether the uk would be better off having a smaller influence on the direction the eu takes , especially if its departure makes the eu move further towards federalisation . 
  if the uk did leave , could non-eu nations be excluded from the eea in the future ? 
  then , uk would need to decide whether to rejoin a substantially different eu or go it alone . 
  if the former , it lost the opportunity to shape the organisation it would rejoin . 
  why do i have so many spoons ? 
  scotland have said they 'd want to retain sterling ( gbp ) . 
  exiting from the euro is * hard * though - it ' would n't be easy . 
  planet money did a good bit on what greece would have to do to avoid absolute destruction if they leave the euro - one of which is having to leave immediately , with no prior warning ( else everyone takes their money out . ), 
  an officially-issued national id card ( as in , not a driving licence or a work permit , but a card that is called the swiss national identity card ) will allow you into the uk , i believe . 
  certainly many polish and spanish friends travel on them . 
  that said , if you 've got a passport it 'd probably be easier to use that instead . 
  i think it 's ryanair 's own captcha - i only know because i recently had to go through that myself on their own site . 
  you could try [ flightchecker ] ( http://flightchecker.moneysavingexpert.com/ ) , it might help ? 
  [ flightchecker ] ( http://flightchecker.moneysavingexpert.com/ ) does this - it 's not pretty , but it scrapes and then stores , i think . 
  if you 're willing to just say `` fly from here '' it 'll give you options . 
  aww , are we not allowed in the gang ? 
  but we spent ages learning the secret handshake !, 
  `` must n't grumble '', 
  they 've moved out of victoria , though , have n't they ? 
  i thought they were in holburn now . 
  if scotland was to leave the uk , i do n't believe it would be made to approach the eu to join as an independant nation . 
  scotland is already in the eu - i take your point but i suspect that as the uk is part of the eu , any ` internal divorce ' would have to be treated differently . 
   but i 've never been to any other country where you 'll get a specific glass for each beer we do that even here in the uk these days , but i suspect that 's mostly so you 're carrying a glass with their brand name on it . 
  i do n't think schengen would be a problem ; it is n't for ireland . 
  the euro may crop up , but i do n't think anyone would try to push for that right now . 
  i do n't believe we have those in the uk . 
  no joke , the ukip chap kept calling them ` pink ' when he was campaigning against eu membership . 
  it seems the colour of our passports was a deciding factor for some voters . 
  that 's part of the reason behind the urban legend about how [ berwick-upon-tweed is still at war with russia . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/berwick-upon-tweed#relations_with_russia ), 
  it 's still visible from place names , of course . 
  oh , and we still have your cnut , when are you popping over to get him back ? 
  strong offering . 
  i 'm tempted by a / r/snackexchange except i 'm on a diet ... 
  so obviously i looked up my own name . 
  it looks like it 's illegal , but with no explanation . 
  given it is biblical , i was surprised it is n't supported . 
  isthere an alternative version of simon that is allowed ? 
  * younger years - going out clubbing , feeling slightly let down by the anticlimactic nature of the dj almost forgetting to play the bongs of big ben , shouting `` x happy new year ! '', 
  then getting back to the party ; * older years - watching a semi-funny wrap up of the year 's news or a musical variety show on tv before watching the big clock chime midnight and then more fireworks than as a kid . 
  ... other than that , the only thing we have that you may not are regional , so i can only speak for myself - * [ auld lang syne ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/auld_lang_syne ) - a sing-a-long of an old burns song in [ scots ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/scots_language ) , so a little hard for most of us to understand , or even remember . 
  cross your arms and hold hands with the people nrxt to you whilst doing this . 
  * first footing - it 's lucky if the first person to `` cross the threshold '' ( come in the front door ) is a tall man carrying coal , who wishes you `` health , wealth and happiness for the coming year '' . 
  you cross his palm with silver ( give him 50p ) . 
  when i was little neighbour 's teenagers would run from house to house to first foot . 
  when older and this was dying out , i was shoved outside at 11.58 and had to listen for the bongs . 
  that looks really fun !, 
  i 'll have to look out for those in international markets . 
  what were saucisse 's policies ? 
  [ sorry , i was just playing with you ... :-) ] ( https://youtu.be/hwhyuraau4q?t=1m33s ), 
  so , what , are you saying that the wind goes right through you ? 
  it 's no place for the old . 
  that is , in parts of wales with high welsh speaking numbers the signs are in english and in welsh . 
  in parts of scotland , english and gaelic . 
  actually , mold ( or mould in british english ) means molde or moho !, 
  actually i would call that ` sliced bread ' . 
  i 'd only call it toast if it had been toasted . 
  i 've often felt that paris and its surrounding area being called `` france island '' is kinda a linguistic insult to the rest of you ... 
  remember we have a distinction between a pub and a bar . 
  many/most are restaurants too . 
  from higher end stuff where they do real barbecue ( and sell craft beer ) to tgi friday style places . 
  and think the latter for what a more general american themed bar is like . 
  random americana hanging from the ceiling , stars and stripes on the menu , etc. 
  they are probably as accurate as the british or irish theme pubs abroad are . 
  * twitch *, 
  i was surprised as well . 
  i noticed.it was only in bars , not in pubs , so i did wonder whether it was a promotional thing - perhaps the brewer was giving it away to more stylish venues , or something . 
  budwiser is on tap in a lot of bars in ireland 's cities . 
  coors can be found in american-themed bars in the uk . 
  are they european now , too ? 
  seriously , first israel , then australia ... 
  that 's like , a sip . 
  that does n't count . 
  some big-drinking uncle somewhere just was too drunk to finish filling in the questionnaire and ruined the stats . 
  see , i always assumed it was the viking blood in the northern english that made them talk to strangers . 
  southerners would probably just about be able to muster a ` tut ' under their breath . 
  so if it 's not vikingers , i wonder where their gregariousness comes from .
