only in england and wales . 
  northern ireland has the much more sensible 0845\u00a0600\u00a08000 . 
  scotland goes one better and does n't have one . 
  copyright does not automatically trump freedom of expression . 
  the court said that it would trump it if it met the following three conditions : 1 . 
  copyright protection was prescribed by law ( i.e. 
  there was a legislative backing ) 2 . 
  it must be for one or more legitimate aims . 
  ( it was held that the aim in this instance was legitimate as it protected the article 1 of the 1st protocol 's right to ownership ) 3 . 
  it must be necessary in a democratic society . 
  ( it was held that the aim made it necessary , the punishment was proportionate and there was no pressing social need for the material ) it means that in some circumstances copyright law may not trump freedom of expression but it seems to leave a very limited scope . 
  it also seems to accept the position that copyright is an ownership rights in the same was as physical property rights . 
  it has nothing to do with the us government or their ratings . 
  it is based on independent sources and interviews with people in the area of the strikes . 
  by who ? 
  as far as i am aware they are the most widely accepted source on it . 
  no problem . 
  glad to be of help . 
  sorry [ here 's the bij 's report on drone strikes since they started in 2004 . 
  ] ( http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/ ) there have been 2,600 - 3,400 people killed altogether in pakistan with 470-890 being civilians , so 34 % at most . 
  there have been 370 -1,100 people killed altogether in yemen with 72 - 177 being civilians , so 47 % at most . 
  in iraq there have been 146,800 - 15,800 people killed altogether with 100,000 - 110,000 of them being civilians , so 74 % at most . 
  yeh i think i covered that in the first sentence by distinguishing between early deaths and subsequent deaths , and in my first comment . 
  i am in no way implying that the us caused the huge number of deaths but that the us presence and actions may have provoked the insurgents and terrorists into killing civilians who were seen to be co-operating . 
  [ the wikipedia article gives a pretty decent overview and explains the different causes . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casualties_of_the_iraq_war#total_iraqi_casualties ) for example most were killed by americans early on with more being killed by insurgents later , through reprisal and revenge attacks . 
  around 16,000 iraqi military and police have been killed , 26,000 insurgents have been killed , 4,799 coalition soldiers killed and between 100,000 and 110,000 iraqi citizens killed . 
  the number of iraqi citizens killed is higher than the casualties on either side , either on their own or together . 
  there were far more women and children being killed during the iraq war as a percentage of `` enemy fighters '' being killed . 
  part of that was to do with undefined objectives . 
  part of it was to do with the fact that the enemy fighters actually had something to attack but were fairly inept at it due to their lack of training . 
  and part of it was carrying out reprisals on villages that troops were known to have visited in revenge for `` aiding the enemy '' . 
  compared to an actual invasion the proportion of civilian casualties caused by drones is really very small . 
  i 'm not saying that it is n't . 
  i 'm just pointing out that he is comparing the upside of one country to the downside of another . 
  i 've had plenty of people who have flipped it and compared , for example , the right of westboro baptist church to protest to the apparent overuse of cctv in the uk . 
  it is the same failure of comparing an upside to a downside and making a broad conclusion about it . 
  you 're comparing `` the best '' of one country in europe , not europe as a whole , to the worst in the us . 
  not exactly a fair comparison there . 
  sheep fuckers actually . 
   in the u.s. we have around 90 firearms for every 100 people . 
  i have always wondered where this number comes from . 
  there is no registry of guns owned in the us . 
  there is only data of guns sold in shops . 
  now some of those guns are still owned . 
  some end up in the hands of criminals and are taken out of circulation . 
  and some again are shipped across the border into mexico ( the atf estimates up to 2000 a day ) . 
  is the `` 300 million guns '' total the total number that have ever been sold or does it take into account the guns that are recovered in crime and the estimates of numbers that are smuggled abroad ? 
  please do n't tar the concept of democracy by comparing what we have to it . 
  democracy is n't where complete agreement from both sides is needed before something happens . 
  the cross community support issue prevents us from having anything like a democracy . 
  i 've seen the sun basically every day in northern ireland . 
  it seems like all of europe is currently being drowned except for us . 
  we must be the chosen ones . 
  not all catholics are republicans and not all protestants are unionists . 
  it is just the more common connection . 
  it actually has its roots in the plantation of ireland . 
  the original inhabitants of ireland were mainly catholics . 
  england then sent scottish and english settlers into ulster to plant it in the 1600s and they were mainly protestants . 
  those settlers wanted to remain under english rule while the irish wanted self-determination . 
  the religion and allegiances have really been passed down from generation to generation to the point that the vast majority in the modern day do n't have a clue why they support their side other than its how they were brought up . 
  because mckinnon not being extradited has absolutely nothing to do with whether what he did was illegal or not . 
  it was based instead on the fact that he was seriously ill and a suicide risk if he was sent to the us . 
  in case you had n't noticed the reason gary mckinnon is n't being extradited has nothing to do with whether or not his actions were illegal . 
  he is n't being extradited because he is seriously ill and a suicide risk if he is extradited . 
  he is being stopped on human rights grounds . 
   i do n't know what you mean by ` an expansion ' . 
  are you meaning to say that all the provisions of the maastricht treaty were ` an expansion ' ? 
  what expanded ? 
  the maastricht treaty formed three pillars of the european union : the foreign and security policy pillar , the justice and home affairs policy pillar and the trade pillar . 
  the trade pillar was the european economic community renamed to the european community . 
  so how did it expand ? 
  it took the trade elements that were originally present in the european community and expanded european security and european legal co-operation to it . 
  not at all . 
  the original community was establishing tight trade between european nations . 
  the eec expanded the trade agreements and formed the european court of justice to facilitate disagreements . 
  the eu consolidated the eec into one of its pillars and raised the ecj to facilitate over the two new pillars as well . 
   in many respects , yes : it has different staff , a different management team , and sells completely different products . 
  so if i were to claim ibm has been selling computer services for 100 years i 'd just be wrong . 
  which is why i did n't refer to ibm as a computer service company . 
  it has always been a technology company . 
  the fact that its modern focus is computers does not remove from the fact that it is a technology company . 
   but there 's more to it than that : the eu was constituted by the masstricht treaty and it simply did n't exist before then . 
  it was n't just a renaming . 
  no it was n't just a renaming . 
  it was an expansion . 
  the european economic community was renamed to simply the european community and formed one of the central pillars of the eu . 
  for all intents and purposes the eu can legitimately be seen as the original european coal and steel community that has gone through a number of face lifts because the european coal and steel community is ** still ** a central pillar of the eu . 
  if the eu had formed in isolation from the ec or the ecsc then i would say that it is a different entity . 
  but it did n't . 
  it formed around and expanded upon those organizations . 
  so ibm is a different company now than its inception back in the 1800s because it has expanded its operations ? 
  even though its core is operating under the same principles ? 
  i really do n't understand your objection since the eu ** is ** the european economic community with bells and whistles attached , which in turn ** is ** the european coal and steel community with bells and whistles attached . 
  is your objection really that the eu evolved and did n't remain in its juvenile state ? 
  it is different . 
  it is more expansive . 
  it took what the eec was and merged it into the eu and added more to it . 
  the ec was a fundamental pillar of the eu from 1993 until 2009 when it was merged with another pillar by the lisbon treaty . 
  that is just like how the eec expanded on the european coal and steel community .
