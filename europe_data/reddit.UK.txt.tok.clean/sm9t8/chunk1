and this is why myself any many others do n't like the eu . 
  waving the national flag in celebration that you won an election is a little odd though . 
  i can see why she 'd stop it , even without any fears about nationalism . 
  depends on whether there would be efta reforms as part of the move . 
  that would have been in the middle of the napoleonic wars . 
  at the time denmark ruled iceland , and britain considered denmark 's neutrality `` hostile '' so we went to war with them . 
  i 'm not aware of any specific opportunity to take over iceland , but in 1807 we attacked copenhagen and captured their fleet , so any danish territory would have been pretty much at our mercy . 
  if the french do n't let us use their warships , we can always sink them again . 
  the spanish claim is over the whole territory . 
  it 's just that it 's only the isthmus where their claim holds some water . 
  the isthmus was n't explicitly ceded to britain , but some time after utrecht , there was an understanding that there was british neutral territory extending about 1.2 km from the rock . 
  this does n't appear to have been mentioned in any treaty . 
  after spain 's attempt to capture gibraltar during the american revolutionary war , britain posted sentries in the neutral ground and later began building on it . 
  spain has also occupied and built on about 0.2 km of this ground in franco 's time . 
  going only by treaties the land is probably spain 's . 
  going by historical agreements its something of a demilitarised zone , and going by how long it 's been controlled , it belongs to gibraltar . 
  my own view is that that spain has broken treaties with respect to gibraltar on so many occasions that we should n't hold too much store by them any more . 
  you ca n't break treaties and then demand they 're upheld to the letter . 
  i 'm not a fan of political parties as they have a corrupting effect on politics , and not just in the chamber . 
  they make people to quick to defend people in their party , and to quick to rubbish people in another . 
  they prevent people from voting for good men and women because they 're the wrong party , or lining up behind an odious piece of work because they 're in the right one . 
  political parties do have their upsides , but they are taken far to seriously for my liking . 
  i 'd like to see more politicians changing party allegiance during their terms , and for everyone to get over it and not demand they resign and stand for re-election . 
  i do n't think it 's always wrong for mp 's to vote with their conscience and against the wishes of their constituents . 
  we should elect people on the basis that we believe they are both moral and rational enough to make good decisions , and then judge them on those decisions when it comes to re-election . 
  what 's the point of an elected representative if you ca n't see how they 've voted ? 
  they 'd all claim to be one of the few meps that voted in a way the public liked . 
  a second tier for trade and cooperation is something i whole heartedly support . 
  if we do n't have a treaty to that effect by the time we have referendum i 'm voting to leave . 
  my own proposal would be for the eu to adopt a two tier structure . 
  the single market would belong to both tiers and be run by both tiers , but the rest of the eu would only apply to one tier and be run by that tier . 
  that 's not bad for the eurozone , in fact that 's good . 
  britain would no longer have a say in the vast majority of the eurozone 's business because we would be unaffected by it . 
  this is the sort of change britain really wants . 
  unlike other nations our goal is n't to add to or preserve eu machinery for our own benefit ( e.g the cap , a central bank , and bailout funds ) . 
  we just want less of that machinery to apply to us . 
  a backbencher will submit a bill and call the government 's bluff . 
  sounds inconvenient , ca n't we stay where we are and move the continent instead ? 
  not really . 
  most of us think france is a great country , it 's just a shame its populated by the french . 
  it does n't really matter how we 're treated . 
  the die is cast and we 'll see the true face of the eu . 
  if they seek to punish us , then i think it will be worth the cost of escape . 
  the eu will be going down a shadowy path where it will do * necessary * things for solidarity and the greater good . 
  there are clearly some people here who would repeat the mistakes of the past while claiming the eu exists to prevent them . 
  if the eu offers us a mutually beneficial deal , then it would demonstrate that the eu is what its most optimistic supporters claim it to be . 
  britain does not need to be made to regret its decision by being punished . 
  if the eu is all it 's cracked up to be then in good time it will accomplish great things . 
  i also do n't look in files that i have no right to look at , and realistically for exactly the same reasons as her . 
  do i really belong in 1940s germany ? 
  i do n't disagree with anyone on your list but there still some heavy hitters missing : generals/admirals : * [ john churchill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_churchill,_1st_duke_of_marlborough ) * [ arthur wellesley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arthur_wellesley,_1st_duke_of_wellington ) * [ francis drake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francis_drake ) 20th century scientists : * [ alan turing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alan_turing ) * [ francis crick ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francis_crick ) * [ alexander fleming ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_fleming ) royalty : * [ alfred the great ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfred_the_great ) * [ edward , the black prince ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edward,_the_black_prince ) * [ elizabeth i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elizabeth_i_of_england ), 
  they should get another king ; that worked for them in the past . 
  yes . 
  the ` confidence of parliament ' is tied to the ability of the prime minister to get government bills passed , such as the budget . 
  this means the person most likely to get a commons majority on such issues is offered the role of prime minister . 
  if a party has a majority in the house , then their leader is that person . 
  the first parts of article 50 are :  1 . 
  any member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements . 
  a member state which decides to withdraw shall notify the european council of its intention ... 
  the uk has not made a decision according to its constitutional requirements , and so can not have notified the council . 
  constitutionally the referendum means nothing , and the current government has declared that it will not invoke article 50 , and parliamentary sovereignty means that it will ultimately make the decision . 
  parliament would n't even be bound by a ` binding ' referendum . 
  few british people are demanding he invokes article 50 immediately . 
  much of the remain side are scrambling for a do-over , much of the leave side want a change in government first , and most people do n't want to rush into negotiations while the country is still reeling in shock form the unexpected result . 
  the official government position was to stay in the eu . 
  losing a referendum on such an important part of policy is tantamount to a vote of no confidence . 
  if he 'd campaigned to leave then he should be following through on his promise , but he campaigned to remain and lacks the mandate to lead the country into and through negotiations . 
  and even if changes are made it smacks of tweaking things just enough to get a majority , and fuck anyone who still disagrees . 
  to add to this . 
  in britain we 've had governments sign up to further eu integration in the face of opposition without seeking a mandate . 
  other countries have had referendums that have either been ignored outright or held again . 
  i think the perception that the eu is undemocratic is heavily influenced by the way in which member governments have been pushing it . 
  this has robbed the eu of some of the democratic legitimacy it could otherwise claim . 
   the final conditions of the exit determine the starting point for negotiations regarding the future . 
  so perhaps a good reason to actually have one set of negotiations then ? 
   the uk government still appears to be clueless on how that in in the end is supposed to look like . 
  how is one side meant to know what a deal should look like , when the other side wo n't start negotiations ? 
   one massive issue is simply time . 
  the two year deadline can be extended . 
  and as time is important why waste it ? 
  if the uk agrees to remain participating in and contributing funding towards a bunch of european programs as part of a long term deal , then they do n't need to be negotiated an part of an exit deal . 
  the eu seems to want to do everything twice . 
   the uk letter makes clear that the uk government will push for parallel negotiations on the withdrawal and on the future relationship . 
   this is a very risky approach . 
  to succeed , we need on the contrary to devote the first phase of negotiations exclusively to reaching an agreement on the principles of the exit i do n't see the logic in the eu 's line on this . 
  britain is currently a member of the eu . 
  in 2 years ( or thereabouts ) britain will not be a member of the eu . 
  why not negotiate the future relationship and the steps that will take it there ? 
  why separate the negotiations ? 
  are the on-going rights of eu citizens an exit matter , or a future relationship matter ? 
  what about the border in ireland ? 
  there were diplomatic spats over the isthmus even before the treaty , but you can see [ the location of the mill tower in the middle of the spanish works here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/sortie_of_the_garrison_of_gibraltar.jpg ) . 
  [ and here on this map , and also the location of the devil 's tower ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/plan_de_gibraltar_-_barbi%c3%a9_du_bocage.jpg ) i do n't think the spanish intended to cede the mill tower but it does appear fortified in that drawing of 1727 , perhaps it was fortified by the british after 1713 . 
  that 's probably more offensive to them than us . 
  territories and the colonies before them have/had their own court systems but their highest court is our privy council . 
  these places have ended up a tax havens because they 're not part of england or the uk . 
  some of have been self-governing for centuries . 
  these places have n't needed to implement the same taxation regime as the rest of the developed world , but despite this they have been as or more stable than many developed nations . 
  this makes them very attractive places to live or do business . 
  this is why both british and non-british tax havens tend to follow the same pattern of being small and isolated .
