i backpacked from south to north germany and bought food there a couple of years ago and do n't remember much of a difference . 
  is there one ? 
  as i said every little helps . 
  if i did n't ask i would n't have got so i was n't `` virtue signalling '' i was merely asking if someone who had already clicked the link could do it for me . 
  well that 's the only reason i 'm going on too . 
  you seem to care so much about me not liking that gutter rag . 
  continuing a debate about nothing for hours on end is . 
  why do you even care ? 
  try some more trolling . 
  foiled again by the internet genius who cares so much about a guy not wanting to click on a link to the daily heil . 
  how ever can i match his incomparable wit ? 
  an excuse you conveniently came up with after i had called you out on it . 
  ah yes it was all just a cunning ruse to make me admit that i love the fail and want to give it all my money . 
  `` i made a mistake !? 
  oh no it was just a joke !, 
  i 'm still smart ! '', 
  can you prove that , 
  well give me a few days to hack into their financial records and i 'll show you where my lack of clicking turns up on their books . 
   unless you want me to get the financial records of the fail i ca n't prove it . 
  how ? 
  does n't mean i have to give them more money . 
  this guy seems to think i 'm claiming to have brought the company down single-handedly . 
  even a tiny effect is an effect . 
  unless you want me to get the financial records of the fail i ca n't prove it . 
  at no point did i say i was having a big effect . 
  you are the one moving the goalposts . 
  we 've been over this :  well others have linked the archive ( i have in another thread but it wo n't let me here . ), 
   and i said : `` providing the link to the pics so others ** do n't have to ** click means they get even less . 
   i 'm giving people the option . 
  it 's like you do n't read what i say . 
  i never claimed it was a big effect . 
  you 're clearly very triggered if this is getting to you so much that you keep having to reply . 
  ( good job catching that downvote you missed ), 
  you mean people like me that you called a snowflake ? 
  i wanted to see the photos , did n't want to click , so i asked for a work around . 
  you seem way too worked up about this . 
  many snowflakes make an avalanche , 
  every little helps , 
  well others have linked the archive ( i have in another thread but it wo n't let me here . 
  and i said : `` providing the link to the pics so others ** do n't have to click ** means they get even less . 
  i 'm giving people the option . 
  again : what part of `` not clicking mean they do n't get advertising revenue '' do n't you understand ? 
  i did n't click so they got less money from me . 
  ( nice work downvoting each of my comments as a post them . ), 
  what part of `` not clicking mean they do n't get advertising revenue '' do n't you understand ? 
  not clicking mean they do n't get advertising revenue and providing the link to the pics so others do n't have to click means they get even less . 
  i was sent that but it would n't let me post it . 
  well my act stops them making money but yours does nothing . 
  no plains yet . 
  it is on sea trails . 
  sorry for not helping to fund that hateful rag . 
  as a consumer am i not allowed to decide what i consume ? 
  can you post them to imgur . 
  i do n't want to click on mail links . 
  well this aged well ... 
  i mean do you really want to be trying to do business in libya right now ? 
  [ what about liverpool or rome ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkrpueocuk ) ? 
  and aberdeen . 
  ( no refinery but that is where all the oil companies are based ) . 
  he was known as dunce at school because people thought he was stupid . 
  for records like this it is . 
  aerials/masts etc are not normally counted nor are non free standing structures . 
  yes being more north is a part of it . 
  we get less hot air off of the continent and more cold air from the north/russia . 
  we 're also not as shielded from the atlantic by ireland as the rest of the uk . 
  that 's my guesses anyway . 
  [ everyone and their mums is packin ' round here ! ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amt2rwffs_g ), 
  it says that it is only looking at private gun ownership not military/police etc. 
  just for perspective [ the us has 112.6 and the world average is 10.2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country ) . 
  they problem is it is so arbitrary ( especially since it is 3 removed for every 1 added now ) . 
  why should one regulation being enacted have any impact on others . 
  it 's just a way to get to complete deregulation while making it sound good . 
  merci . 
  this is exactly what i was looking for . 
  it seemed odd that i could n't find it anywhere even as people were talking about who went through . 
  being picky do you have one that also shows ~ ~ the people who were eliminated ~ ~ ( edit : found it ) ? 
  or the number of candidates from each party that have gone through to the next round ? 
  another thing we will lose after brexit . 
  yay !, 
  that 's ( pretty much ) what my uk one looked like about 10-ish years ago . 
  i think it had nhs on it too . 
  i hope we can keep these after brexit :( https://healthcareinspain.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ehic-card-vector.jpg, 
  have you frenchies really not got round to working out postal voting ? 
   \u00af \\ \\ ( \u30c4 ) / \u00af i find bashing people has the opposite effect to the one you want . 
  being more calm about things makes people listen . 
  i mean dictating terms to the eu probably is n't going to go well . 
  it 's still 1 v 27 and even if some support you there will be others pulling in the other direction . 
  why do people keep calling her lapen ? 
  it 's le pen . 
  i could have said she was racist . 
  the guy was asking why the comic was funny and i was just giving a run down of the candidates . 
  many see le pen as bad as she is very right wing and many see her as racist . 
  i 'm a brit so do n't really know the details of what 's going on too much i just said he was  from the traditional centre right party which is right i think . 
  i was n't talking about his personal political views there . 
  some see it as war mongering . 
  britain tried the same and look where that got us . 
  the british at least still have a strong military with nuclear weapons and two aircraft carriers being built ( we did fuck up and get rid of our old ones early ) and the french are similar ; we may not have the scale of the american military but we 're no push overs . 
  some here do n't like the way it ties us to america militarily . 
  i only included the main 5 from the poles .
