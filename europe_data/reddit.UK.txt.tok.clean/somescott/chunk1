or if you have an irish grandparent that 's instant citizenship . 
  this is what i 'll be using if the uk does leave the eu . 
  i would have done it beforehand , but it 's really not `` instant '' which is why it 's only a last resort . 
  there are plenty of ** expensive ** hoops you have to jump through , as well as needing to order original birth , death and marriage certificates for yourself , your parent and grandparent . 
  i think you have a hypersensitive narrative that has been triggered here . 
  i 'm not saying that the refugees come here hoping to enterally sponge off a european government or be `` charity cases '' for life or anything of the sort , that sounds like what you are trying to argue against . 
  i 'm only talking about this specific video where your argument really does n't apply and your initial interpretation ( way back at the start of the comment chain ) was wrong . 
  they 'd take it if it was given in germany or whatever country they are aiming for , and they do take it along with accommodation and support and that is ** not a bad thing ** . 
  i mean seriously if they refused all `` charity '' the refugee crisis would n't be in the news because there would n't be any refugees as they 'd all starve and vanish , i do n't know how you think they are going to provide for themselves with no opportunities to work and nowhere to live . 
  it 's macedonian police offering the food though and from what i 've read macedonia seems to be letting the refugees through now . 
  and i do n't know why you insist on building this strawman , i 'm not saying the migrants are worthless or bad , i 'm saying your idea for why they are refusing the food packages is wrong . 
  that 's completely inaccurate . 
  for one no one there would admit they are a migrant , that would mean deportation , they are all refugees . 
  by the very definition they are essentially charity cases , they 've left everything behind to go to safety , they do n't have anywhere to live never mind a source of income . 
  i assume they are refusing aid because they want to be moved out of macedonia as soon as possible and so are trying not to become established in any way in macedonia and are point blank refusing any help that is n't in the form of transport to the northern border . 
  it 's like saying no if you want to help us , help us get out of here , we do n't want to stay we 're only in transit . 
  that 's not true . 
  the yes camp were very open about how volatile oil prices are and so focussed on developing other areas of the economy and setting up a wealth fund so that when oil prices peaked money would be put aside to cushion the blow when they fell steeply in the future . 
  what was laughed off was the insinuation that oil is a terrible thing , the way the no camp were speaking it sounded as if it was a horrific curse to bestow upon a country . 
   that 's a fair point . 
  well thanks , it can get exhausting discussing this issue as i have found so often debating this issue on reddit people arguing against me accept nothing less than `` unconditional surrender '' and truly believe that any pro-independence suggestion has the intellectual value of something a five year old thought up . 
  personally i think both the yes and no sides had valid points that were at times exaggerated for political purposes and that the reality would have been somewhere in the middle , no windfall or collapse into the north sea . 
   to be honest , i do n't think economics would have determined it anyway hm well the main card the no side played , and they played it to death , was economic threats and risks , that really was the bedrock of their campaign and it worked very well in the climate of economic crisis . 
  i think this is why a second referendum is more likely to succeed , the shock factor of being told that your economy will collapse will have worn off and the financial crisis will be a somewhat more distant memory and people will have seen that countries the size of scotland in europe faired fine . 
   i think the ruk electorate would have been very bitter , and would have forced the ruk to refuse a currency union even if it was in our interest . 
  i think that would have been a shame , i certainly heard it expressed a lot on reddit that people would be happy to somehow throw scotland to the dogs if it voted to leave . . as if that is supposed to make people want to stay in the union , but i 'd like to be a bit optimistic and think during the long process that negotiations would have been any resentment would have worn off and mutually beneficial arrangements found . 
  i do n't pretend to be an expert economist but jim walker is one such person who backed a currency union as well as prof muscatelli who was actually part of creating the no side 's proposals and is principal of glasgow university and nobel prize winning joseph stiglitz . 
  rather than just name dropping i 'm trying to make the point that despite the fact that everyone suddenly turns into an economist when discussing this specific issue and declares that everything the yes camp suggested was insane , it actually had support from some very prominent economists . 
  so as i do n't have any formal education in economics i ca n't really get deep into the technical side of the argument . 
   of course i ignored what you said because like most snp supporters you are an incorrigible liar . 
  ah there we have it , i do n't think i need to say anything else you 've just shown your true colours to anyone who reads this . 
  you 've just completely ignored what i wrote . 
  the idea that there would have been anything that dramatic is ignorant and ridiculous . 
  the most * extreme * option would have been westminster refusing any form of sterling zone and in response scotland refusing * a very small portion * of the national debt it would have otherwise taken . 
  refusing is n't even a perfect word , there is no rule for how much scotland should have taken , it would have been negotiated and in this scenario scotland would have simply demanded a slightly lower sum than it otherwise would have . 
  no a sterling zone is not the euro . 
  scotland and ruk have extremely well aligned economies . 
  and i do n't know exactly how it would have worked out , i believe it would have been a more continue as normal keeping scotland in mind for monetary policy , i imagine not much would have changed given , again , how closely intertwined the economies are . 
   i see it as an indivisible asset it would n't have been divided but shared under a sterling zone , essentially just giving scotland some continued input into sterlings monetary policy . 
  and sterling very much is an asset , the uk has benefited from having such a strong and stable currency which has incidentally in rocky times in it 's past been propped up more than a little by north sea oil . 
  so the principle was that scotland should n't have to abandon sterling yet take on it 's full share of fiscal debt . 
  some people say no sterling is british and if scotland want 's to leave it leaves it behind , well technically the debt is also british . 
  in context this was just a way of outlining the unfairness of westminster 's position . 
  and judging by what many economists were saying and sources from within westminster i believe following a yes vote there probably would have been a sterling zone , if westminster really did stick to it 's guns though i think scotland would have been justified in choosing to take on a slightly smaller share of the debt as a way to offset the costs of being forced to set up it 's own currency . 
  did you read the article ? 
  the only accusation of real substance was that a firm that made a documentary about malaysia for the bbc world news channel had a pr relationship with the malaysian government , the bbc did not know about this pr relationship but ofcom said they should have screened them more thoroughly which the bbc accepted , changed their guidelines and made an on air apology . 
  the rest of the allegations are about documentaries supplied by charities or the un to the bbc for free again aired on bbc world news . 
  this is hardly propaganda in the sense of an inherent ideological bias , it just falls under ofcom 's very strict rules , and by the way the bbc always did make it clear if the documentaries were provided by a charity or the un so people could watch them in context . 
  moreover ofcom does n't say that those documentaries were flawed or biased . 
  so i think it says something positive about the bbcs impartiality when it 's main * scandals * are involving documentaries from the un . 
  really i would be ** extremely ** surprised if the uk voted to leave . 
  i mean think about it , it 's not even going to be a straight yes or no on the current situation , cameron will have some form of a negotiation and all the polls that have asked how will people vote * after * david cameron has achieved a renegotiation show that it always gives a significant boost to the pro-eu side of the vote , even when people have no idea how far reaching that renegotiation is . 
  on top of this the pro-eu side will have the entire formal uk political machine behind it while the eurosceptics will be made up primarily of backbench conservatives , random wealthy businessmen and ukip , essentially the groups in british society least capable of pr . 
  this was a completely valid point , it never would have materialised just like the uk governments opposing bluffs . 
  the point was that * technically * the uk government could refuse any sort of sharing of the bank of england ( which is a uk wide asset despite the name ) , even though many sources within the government said this was just a bluff , which it almost certainly was . 
  people were quite happy about the uk government throwing it 's weight around about refusing to fairly share or divide assets post independence , but as soon as the scottish government mentioned that it too * technically * could simply refuse to take on any of the uk debt , suddenly it 's a scandal ? 
   the nationalists were completely misleading their people . 
  nicola sturgeon explained this herself in your source . 
  `` when the scottish government was projecting an oil price of $ 110 a barrel , the obr was projecting an oil price of $ 100 a barrel and the uk government 's department of energy and climate change was projecting an oil price of upwards of $ 120 . 
  ** everybody 's projections about oil were wrong . 
  ** ''  it 's fairly clear that a large section of the scottish working-class have been misled by these populists if that 's your view then technically the uk wide department of energy and climate change were misleading the public even more . 
   the problem needs to be highlighted . 
  do n't worry , this issue is brought up like clockwork . 
   they 've also been given the spotlight by russian state propaganda channel rt snp and fsb both have three letters , it ca n't be a coincidence !, 
  not that much love for english , there is a tinge of adultery in everyone it to express their love for another language :(, 
  that 's ridiculous , there is ** a lot ** about the second world war and every other subject in history and other subjects that is n't touched on . 
  in fact i was never actually formally taught about ww2 at all , it just depends how the syllabus works . 
  it 's easy to see yourself as the victim of a conspiracy if you try , it 's not often the reality though . 
  i do n't think there is a huge conspiracy to cover up polish involvement and i still do n't think what you 're saying is accurate . 
   no border between ni and the roi is needed , just enforce one from ni to the rest of the uk , there 's already a nice water barrier to help . 
  i 'm sure residents in northern ireland will love having to go through full border control when traveling internally in their own country . 
  i 'm pro-eu and so pro-immigration in that sense , but it really does not help to describe living somewhere and working as a sacrifice . 
  the only people who you would describe as sacrificing for their country are those who die in war or something similar . 
  also i think it 's inaccurate to talk as if poles get a lot of hate in the uk , there will always be some xenophobia to immigrants as there has been for as long as there have been immigrants but poles are not a singled out at least now . 
  plcbcc for short . 
  when brits say eastern europe we do usually think of anything east of the old iron curtain ( minus germany ) . 
  that 's changing though , i 'd say poland , slovenia , croatia and the czech rep. are seen as the most `` western '' of that area , in public perception though the rest are thought quite of stereotypically whether thats accurate or not . 
  the problem is your two parties are such massive gazeboes as big tent parties go . 
  most democrats would fit comfortably somewhere , it 's many republicans who are closer to fringe parties . 
  i think it would be an awful lot harder in the baltics , they are stable eu and nato members . 
  ukraine on the other hand is neither and had just overthrown it 's own government , not to mention that crimea is almost entirely ethnically russian and was only given to ukraine due to internal soviet politics , it really was the lowest of low hanging fruits . 
  just reading that for a second i was confused about why you were talking about expats . 
  that 's how similar we are , i just would n't think of irish people living here or british people in ireland to be expats or immigrants . 
  well we had a general election not too long ago and i voted snp and i 'll be voting for them in the scottish elections next year too . 
  a lot of it boils down to identity . 
  the uk is always referred to as a `` family of nations '' meaning the constituents are nations in their own right , not regions . 
  however , in reality the political structure of the uk does not really represent this , devolution has made great progress but it is still some way off federalism . 
  scottish independence really gained popularity because of the success of the scottish parliament and in particular the success of the snp which are seen to be a very competent in government , in stark contrast to westminster dominated by the conservatives who have a very bad reputation in scotland and labour who have managed to completely disillusion a country that for decades reliably returned a steady stream of labour mps . 
  so really it got to a point where the sense of national identity was there and backed up by a belief that the scottish parliament would do a better job of running everything than westminster was currently doing . 
  of course as it turned out that was n't enough to convince the majority to `` risk '' a yes , the no campaign were very skilled at highlighting risks and uncertainties , regardless of how factual they were . 
  also in the last days of the referendum the westminster parties promised federalism in return for a no vote which made a lot of people more comfortable voting no . 
  however , that promise has not been acted on in full , as was to be expected . 
  the plan in the white paper for independence was to retain the monarch as the head of state , much like canada and australia 's current situation but with a view that it could be changed in the future after independence if there was enough political will to do it . 
  ah thanks . 
  are the independence movements in valencia / the balearics advocating stand alone independence or being part of an independent catalonia ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  out of interest , how widespread is the catalan language ? 
  from what i 've read it seems that in catalonia everyone is bilingual in catalan and castilian , is that true ? 
  or are there significant proportions of the population that can only speak one or the other ? 
  also is there any sentiment in valencia and the balearic islands to join an independent catalonia and if so is that realistically possible ?
