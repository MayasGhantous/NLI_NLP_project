  i was referring to your list of reasons for voting , the one you quoted yourself . 
  please do n't tell me that is what you based your `` british identity '' claim on . 
  reading out three options you choose yourself and limiting people to those options is absolutely worthless when it comes to polling . 
  which by the way shows how polls are not the be all and end all , you know clinton 's focus grouping like this showed her arguments were resonating well in the rust belt right up to election day ? 
  and again , it was a big issue , it featured much , much more in the debates than `` identity '' . 
  and , for the last time , i do not know why you are obsessing over it given that the scottish people democratically elected a party who clearly stated it is a legitimate trigger for a second referendum anyway . 
  stop building strawmen . 
  nothing i said is post-truth . 
  i 'm talking about the campaign , you are basing everything you are saying on one poll . 
  except , actually , your whole `` british identity '' thing does n't even feature in ashcrofts poll . 
  odd . 
  i 'm not talking about focus grouping after the act , which given all that has happened is not the sort of gold standard you seem to think it is . 
  i 'm talking about what was actually campaigned on , what each side actually said and did . 
  not that it matters at this point anyway , the snp were elected on a manifesto that outlines brexit as a legitimate trigger for a second independence referendum , which is why it forms part of the proposals . 
  all of this is entirely up-front and a * whole lot * more democratic than `` mystery brexit '' from may & co. 
  currency and economics definitely , the eu followed that . 
  `` identity '' was one of the weakest aspects , were you even here for the campaign ? 
  both sides played that pretty well by mentioning it as little as is physically possible because they were both aiming for the swing voters who would be put off equally by bravehearts or northern irish style hyper-unionists . 
  it was not a minor issue . 
  i lived through the campaign and can safely say it was one of better together 's favourite talking points . 
  because at the time it worked , it was widely believed that staying in the uk was the `` least risky '' option when it came to eu membership . 
  so you can bet they used it every chance they could . 
  that did n't stop better together campaigning on the platform that voting no was the only way to secure scotland 's eu membership . 
  the yes campaign did bring up the referendum issue , but they were laughed down at every opportunity . 
  this is * precisely * why brexit was put in to the snp manifesto as a trigger for a second independence referendum . 
  lo and behold the snp were elected , they were proven right , a second independence referendum is now on the cards . 
   and the eu was a minor issue at best . 
  it 's been retroactively made out to be a much bigger deal because it offers the independence supporters another go at their referendum . 
  that is just incorrect . 
  it was one of the main issues of the whole campaign , calling it a `` minor issue at best '' is so far from the truth it is easier just to call it a lie . 
  yes . 
  it was an enormous issue which a lot of british redditors on this sub either do n't realise or wilfully ignore . 
  as someone who lived through the campaign , it was 100 % one of the main pillars of the `` better together '' campaign . 
  and you can see why , scotland is the most pro-eu nation of the uk by a long shot so whoever could win the eu argument would win a hefty amount of votes , that has now backfired spectacularly but you 'd be hard pressed to get some people on here to admit that . 
  in what way are brexit * proposals * promises ? 
  they have outlined the three positions they will take . 
  two possibilities that will avoid a second independence referendum with the alternative being an independence referendum . 
  all up front , and entirely in line with the manifesto they were elected on . 
   there 's no way putin would have tried even a fraction of what he 's done if someone like bush was president . 
  yes he would . 
  it 's not about who is president , it 's much wider than that . 
  all these fringe elements have existed for a long time , they 've just been mostly ineffective . 
  it was the financial collapse that acted as a sort of wizard of oz moment for them , the western moderate consensus had failed , big time , and so alternatives could capitalise on that . 
  that is why putin could start really helping them at that point , because beforehand it did n't matter , they would never make any progress . 
  this has only been compounded by the disasters of iraq and afghanistan ( and perhaps more relevantly , libya ) . 
  any sort of foreign intervention is very highly criticised in the west now which has allowed putin to act brasher with less of a fear of a head on collision with the west . 
   the problem is for us it 's 2 shotguns that 's just wrong . 
  which is why i then continued what i said by explaining why even if labour needed snp votes to keep the tories out , that would happen . 
   but now vote for the snp effectively damning the uk to perpetual tory rule . 
  that 's just wrong . 
  first of all , very few times in history has labour actually required scottish mps to hold it 's majority , i believe it 's only happened once or twice . 
  secondly , the snp have been very clear that they want to keep the tories out . 
  they would be unlikely to form a coalition with labour but they * would * enter into an issue by issue confidence and supply agreement where they would vote for the labour pm , hence keeping the tories out if ever labour + snp numbers could achieve that . 
  so what you are saying is just incorrect . 
  not as simple as that . 
  scotland 's eu status played a big part in the independence referendum . 
  `` better together '' spent ** a lot of time ** trying to convince people that remaining in the uk was the only way to secure scottish eu membership . 
  as we can see , that promise has n't quite panned out . 
  along with others , such as `` home rule '' and `` near federalism '' which the smith commission has n't come close to . 
  so scottish voters are entitled to look at the issue of independence again , now that they have seen the reality of the promises that were made in 2014 . 
  this is what happens when the side advocating change has ** no plan at all ** . 
  the eu referendum was a shambles . 
  it should have been handled like the scottish independence referendum . 
  in the independence referendum the side wanting change ( the scottish government ) produced a very extensive white paper detailing exactly what they would do in the event of a yes vote . 
  there was a plan ready to be put in action from day one post referendum . 
  in the case of the eu referendum , the `` leave '' side offered absolutely nothing like this , there was not even an attempt to make a coherent plan , in fact quite the opposite , they tried to be everything to everybody , accepting every interpretation of `` brexit '' you could dream up as long as it involved voting `` leave '' on referendum day . 
  so what we 're seeing here is the result of people voting for the vaguest of vague ideas surrounding an incredibly complex issue . 
   i 'm not even talking about rent , i mean even buying food , gas , a coffee , or a subway ticket to go talk to someone at the agency or the bank - there will be no cash whatsoever . 
  i did n't mention rent ? 
  you were talking about how in a cashless society you 'd be screwed if your bank account was locked . 
  i 'm saying you 're already screwed if your bank account is locked , barely anyone is paid in cash anymore , we get all our physical cash from atms linked to our non-physical bank accounts . 
  as for the fees rising , my atm example was n't focussing on atms , it was showing how fees can be controlled and access ensured successfully in this field . 
  i do n't think it is beyond government to ensure visa and mastercard do n't gouge everyone . 
  i get what you mean but unless you have lots of cash lying around a locked account is going to screw you over anyway , we get cash from atms from our bank accounts . 
  and it would n't be too hard to enforce maximum transaction fees , for example in the uk all bank owned atms are free and you can use them for free regardless of your bank which is n't the case in other countries . 
  but the privacy issue is an important one . 
  i like how the cloud is conducting a pincer movement around the uk and ireland . 
  it 's leading us into a false sense of security with a sunny day , playing with us . 
  coastguards save people from drowning . 
  the ngos sit in or just outside of libyan waters to allow insanely overcrowded unseaworthy boats to hobble over to them , sometimes even fighting off the libyan coastguard in the process . 
  before the ngos showed up boats had to have at least a chance to get to italy , now all they aim for are these ferries , that means the smugglers can crowd even more people onto even worse boats . 
  that is perpetuating the problem , not helping it . 
  yeah but the ferries are fundamentally different . 
  i can understand and support back at the start of the migrant crisis ngos helping those big groups of migrants who became stuck at europes various borders and fences . 
  but this is like if they started blowing holes in the fences and shuttling people across the borders . 
  that is n't helping , that 's perpetuating the problem . 
  and i get that some people will say the ngos are helping because we ca n't let people drown . 
  well no one was letting people drown before , we have coastguards for just that purpose . 
  and the ngos are n't responding to sinking boats , they 're literally sitting in or just outside of libyan waters to allow ridiculously overcrowded and unseaworthy rafts to hobble over to them . 
  that is extremely different from rescuing sinking boats . 
  that is perpetuating the problem . 
  i get that but also pride parades are also about showcasing and celebrating lgbt culture and just having fun , i do n't think they need to only exist to combat discrimination . 
  but also i think people often forget about what lgbt stands for , literally , on the topic of discrimination the t in lgbt still has a long way to go to catch up with the lgb . 
  to be fair i think people underestimate the weather in ireland and the uk sometimes . 
  it 's never exciting but it 's always present , it is pretty much permanently cloudy ( often overcast , so completely cloudy with no sky ) plus a bit of wind and ever present light rain . 
  it can get pretty oppressive , even in summer you can rarely sit outside to do anything . 
  in the uk it is viewed as an entirely geographical term , because it is . 
  no one thinks twice about it just as no one thinks twice about north america or the indian subcontinent . 
  i only learned that some people in ireland have issues with it when i saw it on reddit . 
  most people in the uk have no idea .
