  the uk is very used to these purely geographical terms , for example the shared sea between ireland and great britain ( the island ) is called the irish sea and no even thinks to consider calling it the british and irish sea . 
  and while we 're on that topic people also do n't think they 're great because the island is called * great * britain , although tourism marketing likes to have fun with that . 
  you 're so right , not to mention if you dare step on the roads you 're going to be run over by either a ferrari or a horse and carriage carrying tourists . 
  yeah sure i guess that all sounds alright ... [ oh god no deal 's off ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1nbcywlb-e ), 
   how about the scottish people reject the rule of house windsor , and swear fealty to the house of orange-nassau ? 
  you 'd get to stay in the eu !, 
  ehhhh the [ orangemen ] ( http://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_700,f_auto,ar_3:2,c_fill/http://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4473998.1497334789!/image/image.jpg ) in scotland [ are n't really keen on that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_orange_lodge_of_scotland#opposition_to_scottish_independence ) . 
  maybe we 'll just become belgian instead , it 's basically the same thing right ? 
  if all established geographical terms are at the whim of present day contentiousness then we 're in for a rough time . 
  if the british isles becomes the british and irish isles then the irish sea must become the british and irish sea . 
  its only logical , so i guess it is contentious . 
  ireland is a bad example though . 
  irish citizens are not viewed as `` foreign '' in the uk . 
  even without the eu they have the right to live and work here and vote in all elections . 
  save us from this brexit thing and we 'll hook you up with some sweet sweet h2o . 
  so is the irish sea the british and irish sea ? 
  it just gets a bit too petty when people start trying to revise very old and established geographical terms . 
  winter is coming, 
  obviously not . 
  we need to shadowban him or something , someone call the admins . 
  those are some freaky butcher come serial killer aprons, 
  love the sagrada familia . 
  i 'm not really into art or architecture , i can appreciate a nice looking building but walking into the sagrada is the first time i 've been really `` wowed '' by a building , it 's amazing . 
  clouds , it 's not measuring hours between sunrise and sunset , it 's measuring how much sunlight actually reaches area . 
  it looks like a case of mountains = clouds and mountains also often = borders . 
  honestly darkness is n't the worst . 
  it 's the overcast days ( days when the clouds completely cover the sky ) . 
  unless you sit outside 24/7 you can easily have extended periods of time when you do n't see the blue sky never mind the sun . 
  not to mention it 's probably raining too . 
  a grey dampness just is n't fun . 
  thats the average summer temperature . 
  in winter you definitely can not wear shorts . 
  it does n't get as crazy as canadian winters though , the temp does n't often fall below zero and if it does it will only be a few degrees below zero . 
  france gets them on weekdays , germany on the weekends and whoever holds the rotating presidency gets them on public holidays . 
   snp shot themselves in the foot by making scottish politics about unionism vs independence rather than left vs right . 
  can we not . 
  the snp did not do this , they campaigned on the issues this election and in the recent council election . 
  ruth davidson made it all about unionism vs independence because being the darling of unionism is a huge vote winner , and it worked . 
  seriously , just goggle image [ scottish conservative 2017 leaflets ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=scottish+conservative+2017+leaflets&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjckv-tv8vuahuik8akhwhhcvgq_auibygc&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=748 ) and [ snp 2017 leaflets ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=scottish+conservative+2017+leaflets&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiu4rr4v8vuahwpamakhsqnccsq_auicygc&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=748#tbm=isch&amp;q=snp+2017+leaflets ) . 
  i think the snp has a concrete core of voters in pro-independence voters . 
  this time round the snp has lost most voters who are n't pro-independence . 
  the snp only gets landslides if non independence minded voters also vote for them . 
  i think if the prospect of indyref2 is put to rest then we 'll see a fair number of conservative seats turning back to the snp . 
  there are a lot of voters who voted conservative to try and kill indyref2 who will be fairly horrified when they have to watch the news for 5 years hearing conservative policy after conservative policy being enacted and knowing they made it possible . 
  the scottish conservatives ran on a platform of ** purely ** being anti-indyref2 , many people have n't thought more deeply about it than that . 
  it looks like it 's got angry eyes and wants to eat me . . 
  i like that the tv is facing away from the desk . 
  no distractions during arbeit . 
  parts of the uk really need some sort of flood protection . . but lol that would require infrastructure spending so they 'll just drown . 
  i got that but i do n't really get the joke or who it 's poking fun at . 
  so either it 's a bad joke that needs explaining or it went over my head . 
  i know putting yourself in a position where it is potentially obvious that a joke * whoosed * over your head is an incredibly dangerous thing to do in reddit . 
  but i live life on the edge . 
  okay good . 
  i do n't mind if people do n't like the snp and god knows there are plenty of them on this sub , but i just cant stand when people base what they are saying on incorrect information . 
  it 's pretty tiring and i see it * a lot * . 
  now , for the sake of completeness i have to add that personally i would argue that after 10 years in governance the fact the snp are still maintaining an impressive dominant position in scottish politics is a massive achievement rather than a stagnation . 
  victory is not only found in continued growth , that is literally impossible in any real democracy . 
  oh come on , you started off by saying `` and support for the snp is going down at quite a rapid rate '' , when i challenged that the only example you gave was of the council elections which you said went `` pretty badly '' , when i gave actual evidence proving that they did not go `` pretty badly '' for the snp you 've backtracked into even more vagaries . 
  i do n't expect you to know a great deal about scottish politics if you 're not from scotland , we 're hardly internationally relevant in that way . 
  and even if you do read about some of it in the media i can understand why you might have got the impression that the snp was doing badly - the media has very much focussed on the scottish conservative rise which is fair because that 's a very interesting story , but many people are wrongly assuming it is coming at the detriment of the snp but the truth is that it is actually coming from scottish labour , barely touching the snp if at all . 
  but , i 've shown you the figures , there is no way that you can twist them into anything like a `` rapid decline '' . 
  if you really hate the snp then talk about them stagnating , that 's a negative twist you can actually support with facts that i 've given you for free . 
  no they did n't . 
  they still have by far more councillors than any other party and actually increased their number of councillors from the last election while their share of first preference votes fell by only 0.03 % . 
  they lost overall control of the few councils they had it for , though so did the rest of the parties , now no council has one party in overall control . 
  but the snp did manage to end labour control of glasgow city council , something absolutely unthinkable only a few years ago and until may it remained as scottish labour 's last big outpost . 
  the snp are now the largest party in 16 out of 32 councils , including scotland 's four main cities . 
  how exactly is that doing `` pretty badly '' ? 
  what ? 
   and support for the snp is going down at quite a rapid rate . 
  really ? 
  i must be reading * fake news * in scotland then because i have not seen the snp 's `` rapid decline '' . 
  i 've already addressed that in the rest of the comment thread , immediately after brexit there was an upswing but that has definitely faded away . 
  yeah right after brexit there was an outpouring of support especially in threads like the one showing the scottish mep asking the eu parliament not to abandon scotland but it 's definitely faded away , i think a lot of it has to do with the emigration of strong unionists from / r/unitedkingdom to here . 
  especially if you get threads with an agenda like [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6b90vo/sturgeon_scotland_wants_to_be_eu_member_but/ ) , any goodwill vanishes . 
   no surprises though , the uk is a true democracy , much more than spain has always been . 
  the fact that they allowed you guys to get your referendum is a testament to that . 
  that 's true . 
  now that we 're being denied a second referendum i am getting a sense of how insanely frustrating it must feel like to be denied any referendum at all . 
  i really hope you manage it one way or another soon and not mess it up like we did as i now highly doubt scotland will achieve independence at least for the foreseeable future . 
   when they heard that scotland could ditch the uk and join the eu they were all happy with seccession though . 
  strangely that has not been the case . 
  i ca n't really explain why but it seems that all the animosity against the uk for being a special snowflake and disruptor within the eu has transferred to scotland . 
  a lot of people assume scotland would look for endless opt-outs and essentially be a new uk which they do n't want . 
  and even beyond that this sub just naturally does not seem to support the idea of scottish independence . 
  the strangest thing has happened , since brexit / r/unitedkingdom which used to be insanely opposed to scottish independence as you would expect , has now become much , much more understanding and balanced . 
  you no longer get downvoted there simply for expressing a pro-independence view or upvoted simply for expressing a unionist view . 
  that has led to a lot of the strongly unionist british redditors commenting less in / r/unitedkingdom and a lot more in here as they get a much better reception . 
  the same people who would bash me and others back in 2014 on / r/unitedkingdom i now only see here . 
   anyway , you would n't belive some of the shit i 've had to deal with . 
  i do n't use the term spanish trolls lightly that 's crazy . 
  i have noticed that anti-independence spanish redditers do seem to be especially hardline . 
  the unionist brits that post on here usually come at it from the angle that scotland is too poor or simply unable to function as an independent country . 
  whereas the line taken against catalonia is ( ironically ) more nationalist , catalonia is spain and that is that . 
  much more blood and soil with the constitution being the only `` facts '' or `` evidence '' that they can point to . 
  i thankfully have never had to deal with the things you are talking about , i do n't think the hardline spanish redditers on here are used to having their views properly challenged and so react very badly to it , maybe it has something to do with there being not many pro-independence catalan redditers , especially considering you need a good command of english to debate on here whereas the sub is in our native language . 
  that 's entirely untrue . 
  this sub , or at least the people who tend to comment on scottish independence related posts do not support scottish independence . 
  this sub does not support scottish independence .
