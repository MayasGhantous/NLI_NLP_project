  i really hope this is just a case of this sub not representing the general population because it seems like less of a welcoming prospect trying to join an organisation that holds those views . 
  i 'm sorry the facts seem to upset you so much . 
  but the facts are there is nothing special about not being forced to join the euro , no one is forced to join the euro . 
  sweden is n't forced , poland is n't forced , bulgaria is n't forced , and so on . 
  if ukraine joined tomorrow , they would n't be forced . 
  if scotland ever joins , they wo n't be forced . 
  unless new eu laws are introduced starting the forcing , because right now there is precisely zero forcing . 
  this sub has been shockingly anti scottish independence for a long time . 
  i really do n't know why but part of it is due to the migration of far-right hyper-unionist british posters from / r/unitedkingdom to here . 
  before brexit they posted all their anti-independence rhetoric there and got upvoted to the stratosphere but ever since brexit / r/uk is no longer so instinctively anti scottish independence and they 've all made their way here to get the free karma that weirdly comes from bashing the scottish independence on this sub . 
  they 're almost all hard-brexiteers by the way . 
  i honestly ca n't get my head around why this sub smothers them in karma but is extremely hostile to people arguing for scottish independence in no small part because they feel strongly european and want to remain in the eu . 
  this is n't being special , ** no eu member can be forced to adopt the euro ** and you do n't even need to cook any books to make sure you fail to meet any imaginary entrance criteria . 
  you need to join erm2 before joining the euro . 
  membership of erm2 is ** entirely voluntary ** . 
   because it would be unacceptable ruk voters for an independent scotland to act as a gateway to european immigration into the ruk . 
  that 's odd because theresa may is certainly not advocating a hard border with ireland and obviously neither is jeremy corbyn or tim farron . 
  that 's incorrect for the euro . 
  edit : why am i being downvoted for a fact ? 
  [ it 's clearly explained here ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/euro-area/enlargement-euro-area/introducing-euro/adoption-fixed-euro-conversion-rate/erm-ii-eus-exchange-rate-mechanism_en ) , you have to join erm2 before joining the euro but joining erm2 is ** voluntary ** . 
  this myth about criteria is just confusion , there is criteria you have to achieve while in erm2 to progress to the euro , there is no criteria that upon meeting forces you into erm2 . 
  even saying you are n't forced to meet the entry requirements is misleading . 
  that suggests you have to cook the books or shift around a few figures to make sure you do n't meet them . 
  the very simple facts are that erm2 membership is entirely voluntary and you can not joint the euro without first going through that . 
  theres no `` forcing '' or avoiding involved , it 's a voluntary choice . 
  honestly was such a shameful referendum , it probably should have been seen more as a canary in the mine for the eu referendum . 
  the uk public are shockingly susceptible to base traditionalist arguments . 
  and billboards like these [ ( 1 ) ] ( https://nicktyrone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/av-baby.png ) [ ( 2 ) ] ( http://imgur.com/ycylv ) . 
  it varies form country to country . 
  some allow all citizens to vote regardless of how long they 've been away ( or even if they 've never lived in the country before ) . 
  others put a time limit on it , and some like ireland do n't allow overseas voting at all . 
  i 've already given examples and i 'm only talking about recent britain because that 's the only time we 've been alive . 
  i do n't think our ancient contributions to the planet make a blind bit of difference to how we 've acted within the eu . 
  and i find talking as if it does equally as sickly . 
  no i 'm speaking on how the country has acted as a geo-political entity . 
  i do n't believe everyone in the uk thinks that way , and i know i certainly do n't , but if you look at how the uk as a country has acted in regards to foreign policy and within organisations like the eu it is undeniable unless you want to bury your head in the sand . 
  it 's quicker than writing `` the uk '' , everyone knows what i mean so do n't overreact . 
  outward looking but with a very strong sense of exceptionalism . 
  not in a tacky loud way like the us , but the country is by nature opposed to anything that gets in the way of the special idea of britain . 
  i mean we have been the most extreme special snowflakes within the eu , not to mention barely anyone in the uk would describe themselves as european , so much so that when we say europe like `` britains relationship with europe '' , we are excluding ourselves from the term `` europe '' . 
  both would prefer not to be called british , but as i explained british isles is a geographical term which to me it is overly pedantic to make a huge fuss around . 
  i went into a lot of detail in the rest of the probably overly long comment chain for just a naming issue as to why i thought that . 
  the term we 're discussing is british isles . 
  i knew it was n't delivered seriously but there was a point behind it which if you look at the reply i got from comment op you 'll see they actually did n't know that scottish nationalism was n't focussed on throwing off some idea of english oppression . 
  scottish nationalists do n't think the uk works but only the `` braveheart '' crazies think england is specifically evil . 
  there is no anti-englishness in say the snp , and more than a few english people in scotland are independence supporters . 
  all geographical terms emerge from somewhere . 
  i completely understand why it is not used when referring to the nations jointly , as it 's a geographic not a political term . 
  there are scottish independence supporters who similarly balk at the idea of the island of britain , but the snp does n't make a big deal about it and i think that is the sensible way to go . 
  you obviously feel strongly about it but i just thought i 'd try and explain why it can appear overly pedantic . 
  often when this or similar issues pop up it 's only the most fervent of irish republicans arguing with the most out of touch british nationalists and everyone else just stays away because well the whole thing is so touchy , but i do really think there are a few leafs ireland could take out of scotland 's book just as there are many things scotland would look to adopt , ( or frankly copy if you ever looked over the white paper ) , from ireland if it ever becomes independent . 
  again , i was trying to be as sympathetic as possible , i do n't think it reflects well when the slightest provocation leads to a full blown accusatory lecture . 
  i do n't even know what you mean when you say `` you guys '' . 
  that 's not really the point . 
  an independent scotland would have exactly the same issue , either with the british isles or the `` island of britain '' with people who really should know better mistakingly believing scotland was british . 
  so if scottish nationalists do n't make a fuss about it , i think maybe ireland should take a leaf out of that book . 
  i completely understand the histories are different but some irish people can be particularly touchy about things such as geographical nomenclature to the extent that it can appear overly pedantic and i say this as an entirely sympathetic outsider . 
  you ca n't just make up new terms , the whole point is it 's excessive to politically correct accepted and established geographical terms . 
  the political terms are already corrected . 
  edit : and to people downvoting me for some reason , to directly answer the question `` english island '' is no more possibly insulting to scottish nationalists than `` britain '' the current name of the island . 
  scottish nationalists do not especially hate england . 
  neither is scotland but as i already pointed out scottish nationalists do n't have a problem with the term , it does n't need eliminated . 
  i mean it would be different if it was the `` rule britannia , one sovereign country for all isles '' , but it 's not . 
  just as south america or north america does n't imply ownership by the usa . 
  i think most people do say that . 
  british isles has always been a geographical term to me , i 'd only expect it in a purely geographical not political or national sense , but i do n't think we need to start editing geographical terms or we 'd be busy for a long time . 
  i think thats overly pedantic at this point . 
  i mean even the snp talk about how scotland will always be part of the british isles . 
  also atlantic archipelago sounds ridiculous . 
  really it should just be zante and ayia-napa instead of all of cyprus . 
  that 's a gift to sturgeon . 
  now she can say , we voted for your general election , politics are n't a game , the people should have their say . 
  so now you need to follow through with a scottish referendum as was in the snps manifesto . 
  or is she just playing politics after all ? 
  i already said i entirely understand that and specifically highlighted that i was referring to what the person i had originally replied to was saying , not what you said . 
  to clarify , all i am saying is that there is difference between saying that you want irish citizenship to be retained for those with a stronger connection to ireland , and saying that you do n't want your good reputation to be sullied by scrounging brits nabbing a passport . 
  oh god , some cringe in there . 
  as i 've said already to you , i think you 'll find if you look in the daily mail comments section you 'll find you sound very similar to the commenters there , only with a different subject nation . 
  i think you have more in common with some brits than you would like . 
  i feel like i 'm in the daily mail comments section right now , honestly swap out the subject nation and you sound eerily like the ukippers . 
  and i 've said elsewhere that i completely understand why people would want to limit it to parents , although i think having it to grandparents is beneficial to ireland and would be to scotland , i completely understand why people would prioritise limiting it to people with a stronger direct connection to the country . 
  but you can advocate that without straying into bigoted identity politics . 
  that 's fine if you think citizenship should be restricted to people living in the country , i get that but i explained in another comment why i think it 's actually beneficial for ireland to have this `` generous '' citizenship law which is why scotland planned to copy it if independence passed in 2014 , because the situation is very similar . 
  i get why people prioritise the emotional aspect of having a significantly strong connection for citizenship though , but you can do that without straying into bigoted and cliche poorly veiled jabs at british people as the person i was replying to did . 
  i literally addressed the football fan point in my comment . 
  otherwise it 's not true , scottish , irish , welsh and english people are so similar culturally that there 's nothing differentiating them as tourists . 
  there are just as many rude or horrible scots proportionally as english and the same for the rest . 
  saying otherwise is just bigoted self flattery . 
   do n't care what a hypothetical country plans to do . 
  they plan to do a lot of things . 
  it was in the white paper which is what scotland would have adopted if it became independent , and is almost certainly what will happen if it becomes independent in the next few years . 
  that 's more than a flimsy notion . 
   anyway , the simple matter at hand is that we are being used as an eu passport factory , it 's of no benefit to us , some six million can apply so it 's time to change the laws and cut you plastics off . 
  and you 're the same person who replied to another of my comments saying you 're worried brits with irish passports would tarnish the good reputation ? 
  you 're certainly doing your best to do that right now all on your own . 
  thats starting to sound pretty bigoted . 
  and if we 're honest i really do n't see a difference between british and irish tourists in general other than irish football fans having a particularly good reputation , and i would n't worry about that unless you think these brits are going to be switching football allegiance too ? 
  none . 
  also you ca n't get a postal vote if you 've lived outside of ireland for more than 18 months , so the diaspora ca n't vote for presidents either . 
  it can only go back as far as great grandparent if your parent already completed the foreign births register application before your brith , which narrows down that eligibility astronomically .
