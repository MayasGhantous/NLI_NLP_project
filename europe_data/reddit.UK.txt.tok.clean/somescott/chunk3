  what we 're talking about in relation to ireland is completely different . 
  it 's claiming citizenship through descent , if you have just one irish grandparent you can claim citizenship . 
  however , the processing fee is n't cheap ( though a drop in the ocean compared to your examples ) which is why i said many people will be waiting for the result first . 
  if irish citizenship was open to anyone for the # 231 processing fee i think most of the world would be irish by now . 
  # 231 ( pounds ) for the citizenship alone which is a lot when you consider the fact they let you skip this step if you 're applying through an irish parent , it 's only if you 're applying through an irish grandparent as you need to technically get on the `` foreign births register '' which has no practical meaning or use other than to allow them to charge you the fee . 
  i mean fair enough if they want to make money out of it , but that 's all it 's for . 
  you also need to add in the cost of ordering original documents as you need original birth , marriage and death certificates if applicable for you , the parent and the grandparent . 
  in the uk originals seem to cost # 10 and in ireland its 20 euros plus postage . 
  then the passport is 80 euros on top of that . 
  so the overall cost will definitely be over around # 350 even reaching # 400ish if you 're unlucky enough with the number of certificates you need . 
  and from what i 've heard it can take quite a while to get on the foreign births register too despite the fee . 
  it 's already very expensive . 
  # 231 just for the nationality nevermind the cost of the passport or the cost of ordering the original documents ( you need original birth , marriage and death certificates if applicable for you , the parent and the grandparent ) . 
  yeah i 'm the same just because it 's extremely expensive for something that is essentially a novelty unless we leave . 
  what ? 
  refugees could rock up in ireland and cross into northern ireland right now if they could / wanted to , there is nothing to stop them , except a very choppy sea and large distance . 
  which is why it is n't happening now , nothing would change about this if the uk left the eu . 
  this is completely not the case . 
  i mean better together literally had an official man ( anyone remember jim murphy ? ), 
  just to tour the country and shout at people on high streets from a soap box . 
  also i 'm taking a guess that you might live in glasgow which had an did get lots of yes stickers on lampposts . 
  glasgow was one of the few majority yes areas in scotland , as someone who was in a very strong no area during the referendum i can confirm that better together signs and campaigners were absolutely everywhere . 
  he uses the word `` reformed '' purely because polling consistently shows that when you ask people if they want to stay in the eu and then ask them if they want to stay in a * reformed * eu then you get like an extra 10 point lead for the remain side simply by adding the word reformed even when people have no idea what the reforms are . 
   can confirm and so ~ ~ can ~ ~ * could * my dog . 
  fixed that for you . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i 'm left leaning too and while i think we should accept more genuine refugees i think we should be taking them from the camps as the uk does ( though hopefully in higher numbers ) . 
  that would dissuade so many people from making dangerous crossings and journeys and would also reduce the amount of fake-refugees as they are unlikely to want to spend extended periods of time in camps and are more likely to be found out by the people working there and other residents . 
  what merkel has done is saying we 'll take everyone , as long as you can make it across the med and into germany . 
  that is not everyone , that is everyone strong or rich enough . 
  in the comments when this was posted on / r/unitedkingdom people explained that this may be the case for the majority of less skilled jobs where pay varies less across the country , but for more professional jobs like software development etc the wages in the south are significantly higher to the point where it still makes a difference after housing is factored in . 
   one of the few reasons you 're lugging two tons of metal with you when you drive is because smaller personal vehicles are less safe . 
  no i 'd say it 's mainly that most people at least occasionally use their car for transporting more people and carrying loads like groceries or packages . 
  you can buy really small cars like smart cars today , and they 're perfectly safe , they 're just niche because most people like to at least have the option of having more space . 
   with ai , you also lose all traffic lights , yeah but the principle will still be there , like letting pedestrians cross and traffic traveling in the other direction . 
   100mph without stopping a single time . 
  this will never happen outside of motorways , you still need to be able to stop in time if someone or an obstacle falls onto the road or the car in front of you breaks down or crashes . 
  also this whole grain of sand thing will alleviate traffic but it certainly wont solve it on our roads as you seem to be suggesting . 
  even completely automated subway systems can get congested and they are infinitely more straight forward than some unimaginably massive system we 're talking about here . 
  or if you like just think about people walking in a crowded street , that gets clogged up , or hey even sand it 's self in an hourglass . 
   so , given how inflexible trains are with scheduling , and how you really need a critical number of users before a train journey is even profitable , i do n't really see them as part of the future , i think they 'll be essential unless you want the road system deadlocked with grains of sand 24/7 . 
  if you want to be comfortable in your pod then two of these cars are going to take up about as much space as a regular car and a lot more space on the road network when you consider emptying out public transport . 
  ai can solve a lot of things , but it has limits when it 's physically confined to our antiquated roads . 
  if they could fly , then we 're talking , but until then i think you 're being overly optimistic . 
  and [ ghetto english ] ( https://youtu.be/gfjuwej8yji?t=5s ) . 
  needs to work on the accent but i think we can chalk him up as trilingual . 
   re : trains . 
  i do n't know . 
  it 's hard to know what might be , or what might have been . 
  how would a city like , say , la have evolved if there had n't been such a push towards roadbuilding ? 
  i do n't know what you mean ? 
   just out of interest , why do you think this ? 
  in my view , once there 's enough ai capability in cars and coaches , the fluidity of the road vs. rails really becomes a big bonus ... because trains carry a lot of people in a small space , cars are the least space efficient mode of transport . 
  even with perfect ai cars ( which we 're a long way off from ) you 'd still get horrendous traffic jams just from the sheer number of cars on the road trying to move . 
  a good example of this is actually if you 've ever played games like cityskylines , the cars in that game are obviously ai , they do n't break down , do n't crash , move incredibly fast but then even then traffic is still one of the constant problems in that game , even though you can custom build road systems from scratch to try and be perfect , british cities do n't have that luxury . 
  ai cars are more about convenience and i 'm sure they could optimise road usage to a degree , but really that would be a drop in the ocean compared to what most people seem to imagine . 
  rush hour will still suck , it does n't matter how smart your driver is when no one is moving . 
   it 's really not a certainty that norway 's oil income is best invested by a centralised bureau rather than a market-led group of investors . 
  i took comment op 's point to be more that nationalised oil allowed norway to retain more of the profits and invest them , rather than just tax the companies and spend it all like the uk has . 
   similarly , for rail , it could be argued that rail networks served a purpose when they were first built , but that continued state support in the sector impedes the next generation of transport technology from making an even greater beneficial impact . 
  i think that 's a bit too optimistic . 
  we 're a long way from being able to replace rail and in fact i do n't think we even will , it makes much more sense to move to say self driving trains ( lots of self driving cars instead does n't make sense ) . 
  furthermore , nationalised rail such as in the netherlands and germany and much of europe for that matter are technologically superior to ours ; many more modern trains and high speed rail is taken for granted on major routes . 
  and thirdly , the government hugely subsidises private rail , ticket prices would be unsustainably high without it . 
  it 's not some lean hyper-efficient low cost private sector poster boy , far from it . 
  rail and oil = / = telecoms . 
  yeah , i 'd only support it once the kosovo issue is well and truly defused , and that will take an awful long time considering there does n't seem to be a real appetite for it in serbia . 
  i think a lot of people are missing the point here , yes the threshold is high and it will stop a lot of people being eligible , which is precisely the point . 
  the government desperately wants to reduce non-eea immigration because that 's all it can control . 
  to be fair the uk offers the most to commonwealth citizens . 
  being a british citizen is inconsequential when applying for a visa in any of those countries . 
  yeah but to be fair the uk 's special allowances for commonwealth citizens are rarely if ever replicated anywhere brits would like to emigrate . 
  for example as far as i can tell australia and nz have nothing special to offer british expats . 
  i do n't think it should continue if it 's a one way street . 
  nicola sturgeon ( scottish first minister ) is a pretty good speaker . 
  she sounds like a normal person and is more than capable of sounding angry or passionate when the need arises , this is particularly noticeable when she 's speaking against scottish labour leaders ( the opposition ) who have all been pretty weak speakers . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80ipn7jnooy ) and [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kagqoocsips ) are good examples ( sturgeon is in the pink and red ) . 
  ignore the cringey annotations , the people who make clips of these things tend to be a bit over enthusiastic . 
  and it was virtually untouched by ww2 so it 's not a comparison . 
  no but i think it 's disingenuous to suggest that the eu is just coincidental to the peace and harmony in europe . 
  one of the purposes of the eu was to make war almost impossible and it 's certainly done that . 
  in fact i 'd argue that it 's done that so well that it allows people like yourself to disregard it . 
  it would be a lot easier if the eu was a looser organisation and there were examples of it mitigating serious threats of war between member states , but in reality member states are now so closely linked the idea of conflict erupting between them is just ridiculous . 
  not to mention the positive impact it 's had on non-member states . 
  the slow deescalation of tensions between kosovo and serbia for example and between the former yugoslavs in general is in no small part due to their aspirations for eu membership , more precisely the eu directly telling them they do n't have a chance of joining until they normalise relations . 
  i mean just look at asia , it 's perhaps the prime example of a continent heavily effected by ww2 where conflict is nowhere near as unlikely as in europe and where ww2 still looms heavily over foreign affairs in a way that is unimaginable in today 's europe . 
  ** good : ** the eurozone seems to have survived the crest of the crisis wave . 
  sure there 's still a long way to go and the greece problem is far from solved , but i do n't think it will be fatal which did look possible . 
  ** bad : ** migrant crisis . 
  the eu just ca n't catch a break . 
  as if the credit crunch was n't enough now we 've moved from an economic crisis to one that needs to be addressed more politically / socially . 
  this could n't have really come at a worse time considering we 're seeing a high tide of euroskepticism following the eurozone crisis , because to address it properly we 'll need a lot of bold big-picture unified action which we 're just not seeing . 
  i think this will be extremely prominent in 2016 and i do n't know how it will turn out . 
  ** however : ** just as the eurocrisis brought an end to some unsustainable euro-economic policy ( ala greece for example ) addressing such a huge political issue could be a catalyst to streamlining eu institutions from the bloat they 've accumulated from the relatively easy noughties . 
  everyone always says how the eu needs reforming , maybe we 'll finally see it happen ? 
  well we can can hope anyway . . 
  hm that might be the case if you 're working in a&e or surgery , but in general practice for example most people who come in have vague symptoms they struggle to describe . 
  you need to have a pretty strong command of the language to grasp what they 're trying to describe and there is a danger that you overlook subtle clues and focus on what you can easily understand , that 's always a danger anyway but i imagine it 's only amplified if there is a language barrier . 
  also on another level too so , so many patients actually come in with mental health issues . 
  i do n't think it 's something you can control but i 've always thought patients are less likely to open up to a doctor if they ca n't communicate with them completely fluently .
