  it 's another barrier to what is already an subject most people find embarrassing and difficult to talk about , not to mention how difficult it is for the doctor to show the right level of empathy in response , it 's ridiculously easy to come across as cold if your vocabulary is limited . 
  the language barrier could prove an issue . 
  personally i do n't think i 'd ever be confident practicing medicine in a non-native language , one small misunderstanding could have too serious consequences . 
  yes personally when i was at school i saw just as many girls as boys who had trouble with rules , in fact the very worst were usually girls . 
  i think the feminine narrative is just coming because we 're on reddit , an echo chamber of formerly disruptive boys is likely to make you think that there is a pattern with gender . 
  i 'm not responding to experts , they have not posted in this thread . 
  i 'm summarising what i 've read here , i 'll spell it out . 
   they literally mean more active as in more exercise , p.e whatever . 
  yep that 's fine no one has any problems with that , but i 'm responding to is people are saying here is that [ it 's against `` boy 's nature '' to have to sit down and study in general ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/513a535fced0a0eb45584f1c4b946c4f.png ) , i 'm afraid that 's not something we can get around , no boys or girls or adults for that matter enjoy sitting down and being taught or learning , but it 's what has to be done . 
   no one says that , less homework is whats warranted . 
  again i 'm responding to posters in this thread saying we need to [ get rid of homework entirely . 
  ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/bbe3300ac7eb045a83bb3afee40fa8ae.png )  that 's already happening in countries where they 're putting a greater emphasis on continual assessment , like it is in college . 
  that 's fair enough , although personally as much as i hate doing exams i think they 're definitely here to stay . 
  a qualification is as much about proving your capability to learn and preform as your knowledge , there is a reason a degree in a mainly coursework based course does n't get you into the same jobs as a tough degree with difficult exams . 
   not even going bother with this . 
  why not ? 
  [ this ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/0978c6aee34cca6a6d617a0838e7d6c1.png ) is what i was referring to . 
  so hopefully i 've mapped out what i was talking about , i was responding to this thread , not the considered opinion of experts . 
  when i posted a lot of these comments were more prominent and receiving upvotes which is why i wanted to bring attention to them , i can see why it may have looked like i was building strawmen now that there are more reasonable comments and those ones have been downvoted , or at least not upvoted as much . 
  yes i agree . 
  yes this is what i 'm reading too . 
  i should have expected the downvotes though , reddit is full of people who think the system has tried to hold them back and they 've suffered some injustice by being told off for not doing homework or ignoring a lot of their work . 
  so many armchair educational experts here . 
  apparently to make education work for boys we need to make school much more active ( whatever that means ) , remove most day to day discipline , have no more homework , no or less exams and of course not teach anything that is n't a science because what a pretentious waste of time that is . 
  yes i 'm sure that would all work perfectly . 
  it does n't matter that you found it boring , it 's the education system 's responsibility to provide you with a wide ranging education so obviously everyone is going to have a lot of knowledge they 'll never `` use '' , although i 'm sure we 'd all complain if suddenly 70 % of school leavers had even less common sense knowledge about politics or world religions for example . 
  the same thing goes for degrees , it 's about breadth of knowledge more than anything , as you are well aware you do n't leave university as an expert in the job you end up in and particularly in science much of the knowledge you 've been taught will be outdated pretty quickly . 
  your degree is n't an apprenticeship , it 's as much about proving to potential employers that you are * capable * of learning a broad range of aspects of your subject as anything else . 
  there are a lot of guys trying to make excuses for their disruptive behaviour when they were at school , as if they 'd all now be at top tier universities if only the schooling system accommodated their boisterousness instead of so narrow mindedly enforcing discipline which apparently is now sexist towards males . 
  the truth is there are also plenty of disruptive , rowdy and lazy girls in schools . 
  you have to work hard to get to university , it 's not a god given right . 
  schools can and do help you but you have to take responsibility for your own attitude , male or female . 
  if more females students are doing that right now then it 's not sexism to see it reflected in admissions . 
   you obviously saw and heard what you wanted to , to support your prior held opinion . 
  pot , kettle , black . 
  you obviously saw what you wanted to in my comment . 
  i literally said i was struck by how well reasoned ** both ** sides were . 
  although i support the result i do n't think it is a perfect situation and believe many of the points raised by mps on the other side were very valid , just not enough for me to tip the scales on balance . 
   despite the terror bombings there is a massive difference between terror bombings and the targeted bombings happening in iraq and syria , not just technically but the whole objectives are different . 
   you and those adventurous people who want to try a bit more death and destruction to see if maybe it works a counter-point to this was raised very well in the debate . 
  the liberation of sinjar from is is not a pointless bit of death and destruction , the protection of baghdad from is is not a pointless bit of death and destruction . 
  if there was no western military action against is at all they would have toppled the iraqi government and be in a much more powerful position today and with that have much more resources to devote to their idea of `` jihad '' against the west in the form of terrorist attacks which would be targeted against the west whether we were involved or not because ** that is the core of their ideology ** . 
   you and those in favour should be ashamed , i know your grand and great grand parents would be . 
  this is as bad as the prime minister calling people with your point of view terrorist sympathisers . 
  if you listened to jeremy corbyn 's speech he said abuse like that against either side of the argument is not helpful and should play no part in these debates . 
  it 's small minded , petty and really casts doubt over the quality of your reasoning in general . 
  on one hand it 's the principle , france has asked us to help them , they are our allies . 
  secondly conducting such a large campaign is actually quite a burden on a countries military resources , so purely practically it is a big help to our allies if we help shoulder that burden . 
  and thirdly the raf is very advanced in precision targeting techniques and technology and is equipped with some of the most accurate bombs in the world , so they will certainly have a lot to offer in a targeted bombing campaign . 
  it 's definitely not all down to brute strength and numbers ( like russia can offer ) in this case . 
  exactly . 
  it essentially saved the kurds who are as close to the `` good guys '' as you can get in syria right now . 
  maybe the pm should let a few comments slip that is is n't all that bad and while we 're at it underhandedly slide them the details of iraqi defensive positions around baghdad ? 
  that is if you think making ourselves `` less of a target '' should take priority over targeting is . 
  exactly . 
  it 's very easy to say things like this when you 're on another continent and know there are already airstrikes and international efforts going on against is so in reality it 's fate is largely sealed . 
  these people would have a vastly different opinion however if they were say a jordanian facing an expanding is with no international resistance that had just toppled baghdad . 
  yes exactly . 
  there are a large number of people who will argue against military action in virtually all cases because it is * very * easy to appear moral and as if you have a much more mature insight by doing so ; as it is just as easy to portray anyone who supports military action as a shortsighted warmonger . 
  i listened to most of the debate and was struck by how well reasoned both sides were , but particularly those voting cautiously in favour , hillary benn being a great example and with all due respect to his father i think the son showed an awful lot more developed logic and sense if we 're comparing the speeches . 
  poor northern ireland , bumped into third place by france . 
  i love how it 's obvious you 're a swede because your english is better than everyone else 's , including the natives . 
  yes in regards to having air strikes in syria against isis . 
  not boots on the ground in syria though , we are not capable of trying to invade and solve everything in syria . 
  however , i think we need to send the message that being in an insanely complicated situation is no guaranteed shield if you start targeting nato / the eu , our first priority has to be protecting our own citizens from an organisation or `` state '' that is targeting them . 
  well i suppose we 'll see which of us have interpreted it right soon enough . 
  personally i see it as a lot of people lukewarm on the eu who are turned yes voters by just the fact a `` renegotiation '' has happened , regardless of how extensive it is . 
  we will have a renegotiation and i specifically clarified even when the nature of the renegotiation is n't known , it still regardless swings the vote to yes . 
  the fact is for whatever reason just the knowledge that there has been some sort of `` renegotiation '' is enough to swing a lot of people to yes , the finer points of that will only be understood by a minority of the population who are not going to be swayed by anything anyway . 
  why do you feel spanish ? 
  there is n't a scientific formula to national identity , it 's a mixture of culture , history , language and just opinion . 
  and thanks for the downvote . 
  in the article it explains that people were shouting because this was literally just a trial run for the flag , there was n't a movie set yet and there was no warning . 
  so to anyone watching it looked as if two people had climbed on the building to unfurl the swastika as some sort of neo-nazi protest . 
  there was no movie set in the area at the time , it was literally a trial run for the flag without any warning . 
  to anyone watching it would have looked like two people had climbed on the building and were unfurling the swastika as some sort of neo-nazi protest , i ca n't imagine why people would n't start shouting at them . 
  there does n't need to be a reason `` why '' beyond that the people believe that they should be an independent nation . 
  you fool , clearly an issue of this magnitude should require a unanimous decision , with any spoilt ballots counted as a no just to be on the safe side . 
  i have seriously found added appreciation for how the uk handled things . 
  a few times it was mentioned that some people thought the rest of the uk should get to decide the issue too , but as an aside and it was never seriously considered , nor was having a threshold above 50 % , because both of those are just democratically illogical . 
  i 've been shocked over the past few days to see so many people upvoted for saying the whole of spain should vote on this issue or that no vote should be allowed at all because of the constitution . 
  that 's just insane !, 
  if the constitution had racial segregation in it would we accept that for eternity , because you know , constitutions are infallible and can never be changed ? 
  it 's as if people in this sub have decided that after the fall of communism europe 's borders became divinely perfect and anyone wishing to change them must be an insane foaming at the mouth extremist . 
  so you would have no qualms in a union with france with spain being given autonomy but the national government being in paris ? 
  there is no right or wrong answer to national identity and it is shockingly arrogant to claim that anyone who feels catalan and not spanish is brainwashed or insane . 
  any polls not mentioning a `` renegotiated settlement '' should be ignored . 
  the reality of the referendum will be voting yes for the renegotiated settlement and no to leaving outright . 
  every poll conducted that includes the renegotiated settlement bit shows that it hugely swings the vote to yes , even when people have no idea what that settlement is . 
   i do n't know how you can think this is anything but a massive clusterfuck . 
  did n't you get the memo ? 
  around the 1990s european borders were divinely proclaimed utterly perfect and anyone wishing to change them must be a foaming at the mouth extremist . 
  i would n't try to argue . 
  it 's a cast in stone narrative to say that even entertaining the idea of a referendum in less than 25 years ** no matter what ** is tearing up the results of the past referendum . 
  the reality of course is that the talk of `` once in a generation '' from the pro-independence side was n't a pledge but more of a warning to their supporters , no one could have foreseen the snp surge post-referendum and it was entirely possible that it would have taken the snp a long time to regain the power needed to hold another referendum . 
  it 's a clearly anti-independence non-scot that chose to refer to `` scots '' in that way . 
  talk about a strawman . 
  this is like the universal problem for british students learning a foreign language . 
  coupled with the fact we are taught foreign languages very badly ( it 's all translation , mostly with the help of a dictionary , literally zero spontaneous conversation ) . 
  10/10 would watch .
