  she 's so enthusiastic about everything historical i feel like it 's my favourite thing in the world too , for 60 minutes at least . 
  commissioners are appointed by elected governments . 
  the eu is n't a government , it 's a collection of nation states . 
  you ca n't have everything directly elected until or if the eu becomes one nation state . 
  every hotel i 've been to on the spanish balearic islands has had one , maybe it differs by region . 
   the difference would be that scotland would go from a `` never adopting the euro '' to `` eventually adopt the euro '' right ? 
  yes technically , the same as all the other non-euro members bar denmark . 
  obviously , the term is `` house price '' though and it refers to anything from a bungalow to a top floor flat in a tower . 
   its really not , imagine if this guy had to pay his 3.6 billion pound tax bill . 
  think about all the companies he would have to asset strip to get that , and all of the jobs lost . 
  but he did n't , because inheritance tax never works like that . 
  you 're arguing for scrapping it all together . 
  i 'm not advocating that we enhance it to some quasi-communist form of total redistribution . 
  no , not unless you were raising income tax only exclusively at the top bands , raising it across the board would be incredibly unfair . 
  also we are not in a position to throw tax money away , i 'm perfectly fine with raising the top band of income tax * and * keeping inheritance tax . 
  the truth is , as taxation goes , it is one of the most painless forms of taxation . 
  no one is going to have to penny pinch or economise in any true sense of the word because their 500k + or 1million + windfall is marginally reduced . 
  it 's a very london-centric policy , raising the threshold like that . 
  while 500k may be a very average house price in london , in most other places in the uk it will get you a very nice house . 
  not to mention the fact that 500k is still 500k . 
  i do n't really care if 500k gets you a patch of grass in london , inheriting that completely tax-free is still extremely generous at a time when we 're slashing services low-income people rely on and starving the nhs . 
  i 've already explained that there ** is n't ** an opt out for croatia . 
  there also ** is n't ** an opt out for much older members like sweden , czech republic , poland , bulgaria and romania . 
  the * technical * opt out comes from the eu rules themselves , in that a country is only ever obliged to * eventually * join the euro , which in real terms is entirely meaningless and toothless . 
  there is no special deal for these existing members i have just listed , none at all . 
  for scotland to be put in a different situation the rules would have to ** change ** . 
  which will not happen , at least not until long after scotland joins because with the climate as it is the non-euro members would shower that proposal in vetos before it could ever see the light of day . 
   the problem is she ca n't trigger a second independence referendum , only westminster can technically the scottish parliament can hold an un-binding referendum , but i agree that is extremely undesirable . 
   it simply wo n't happen unless polls start showing 70 + % of scots demanding to leave . 
  wrong . 
  westminster will allow a binding referendum if the scottish parliament calls for one . 
  and no , not necessarily out the good of their hearts , but because they know blocking a referendum is the one single thing they could do to increase support for independence massively , making it all but inevitable . 
  to this end even the leader of the scottish conservative party ( scottish branch of the party in power in the uk ) , while vehemently opposing a referendum and styling herself as a `` nationalist slayer '' has said , publicly , that westminster should never block a referendum the scottish parliament has voted for . 
  equally , the prime minister 's own scottish secretary , while also opposing a referendum as strongly as a person can , has also said , publicly , that westminster should not block a scottish referendum . 
  these statements would not have been allowed to be made if may was planning to block a scottish referendum . 
  and to give her credit i think she is far too canny to even consider blocking one . 
  i mean look at the president , quebec for example . 
  once an independence movement looses two referendums people get completely fed up with it and there is massive pressure for pro-independence parties to drop the issue for a very long time . 
  and this is only magnified in scotland due to the perception that with brexit this should be the high water mark of support for independence . 
  so by winning this referendum may has the best chance she 'll ever have to kill of independence , truly for a generation . 
  if she goes insane and blocks it , support for independence will explode and it will become inevitable . 
  i do n't mean that she 'll have one instantly , i think she 'll use the committee result to have one within this scottish parliament which lasts until may 2021 . 
  all signs are that may will trigger article 50 next year which means we should know the makeup of brexit by 2018 . 
  scotland will then definitely want a referendum very soon after that because if they gain independence before the uk formally leaves the eu then that will make it much easier for scotland and the eu to negotiate scotland 's continued and seamless eu membership . 
  moreover , the snp are really pushing the bounds of the scottish parliament 's electoral system . 
  they have overwhelming support but they have lost their own majority and so with the greens added there is only a pro-independence majority of 3 in the scottish parliament . 
  it is all too possible that the snp and the greens could remain extremely popular up to the next election but still narrowly loose out on a pro-independence majority in 2021 meaning they will be unable to hold a referendum regardless . 
  this is the result of independence being woefully under represented as a view in scottish parliamentary parties , mainly for historical reasons . 
  yes thats all fine , but it is a change from what you were saying before about how there should n't be `` another exception '' for scotland . 
  there would n't need to be an opt-out . 
  sweden , poland , czech republic , croatia , hungary , romania and bulgaria all have no official opt out but are clearly not going to join the euro until their governments choose to . 
  they are all technically * obliged * to join the eurozone at some point , but in reality this is entirely symbolic as there is no time limit . 
  the eu currently has no mechanism to force countries to join the euro , which would be a catastrophic move in any case and doomed to be showered with vetos anyway by the countries listed above . 
  that is the ideal , but the eu is very much an entity of reality . 
  almost everything of consequence is flooded with asterisks and exceptions in the eu . 
  the reality is no country is going to take up the euro until their governments want to . 
  if the eu wanted the euro to be a core principle without compromise it should have taken a hard line from the beginning . 
  there are far too many countries in the eu right now with no realistic prospect of joining the euro soon ( even without an official opt-out ) to start treating the euro as anything other than a completely optional currency at this point . 
  growing the euro will only come by making it more attractive so that countries change their mind and voluntarily wish to join it . 
   they would have to adopt the euro eventually , a demand i have not heard discussed . 
  there are plenty of countries who `` have to adopt the euro eventually '' . 
  the reality is no country will until they want to , it 's not really an important point of discussion but it * will * be a very repeated soundbite from the anti-independence side because the euro has horrific pr here . 
  it is virtually unworkable and impossible . 
  i say this as someone who wants scotland to remain in the eu . 
  what we are seeing right now is a bit of political theatre , not necessarily in a bad way , she is being sincere but i highly doubt anyone involved right now * truly * expects scotland can remain in the eu without independence . 
  sturgeon has a mandate from the scottish parliament to seek any way possible for scotland to remain in the eu , hence statements and meetings like these . 
  she has also established a committee to look at any and all options . 
  sooner or later that committee is going to report back and say the only way for scotland to stay in the eu is to become independent , and then she will trigger a second independence referendum . 
  it 's a long drawn out route to the referendum , but it means she can say that she legitimately and actively explored all other options ( however far fetched they were ) . 
  obviously , unless the government also wants to leave the single market . 
  you ca n't have free trade while also essentially banning companies from purchasing goods from elsewhere in the single market . 
  tariffs are n't the only form of protectionism . 
   the law changes and they have n't registered with the fbr . 
  why would there be an exception or an extension period given to people who have n't bothered registering ? 
  i 've explained this too many times now . 
  that 's not how nationality law works . 
  look at the example you gave of changing jus soli . 
  nationality law says children born in ireland ** after january 2005 ** have to have a resident parent in order to become citizens . 
  children born ** before january 2005 ** on ireland still can request their citizenship regardless , even if it was n't done at the time . 
  that means that a child born to say american tourists in 2004 in ireland can still apply for citizenship in 2050 if they so wished . 
   when exactly did they say that the law wo n't change in the future ? 
  [ the foreign minister said as much in the dail ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-ireland-irish-passport-britons-urged-to-stop-applying-after-eu-referendum-vote-a7107016.html )  hypothetical policy from a hypothetical independent country . 
  you pissed your pants when it mattered . 
  i do n't care about your white paper as it will never come to be . 
  you 're getting a bit hysterical , i 've ignored your other insults . 
  and if you were paying attention to whats happening in scotland you 'd know a second referendum is now virtually inevitable and that it is looking like there could be a yes vote this time round . 
  as for the rest of what you said , i 'm glad the irish government does n't think as you do and neither do most irish people i have met . 
  if anyone is giving ireland a bad name , it 's you right now . 
   if the law changes and they have n't registered with the fbr , then they of course will be cut off . 
  they would no longer qualify . 
  you just ignored what i said ? 
  of course there could be a law change that says that , but that is not how it is usually done , it is not how it has been done in the past and it would go entirely against what the irish government has said regarding the matter ( they have reassured everyone that the policy wo n't change ) . 
  so possible , yes , almost everything is possible , but likely ? 
  definitely not , especially not one that would reach in to the past as you want and would n't simply be applicable for people born from the date onwards . 
   just so we are clear , do you have a dog in this fight ? 
  are you a brit who is using us to retain an eu passport ? 
  the only people who argue that we should keep our generous citizenship by descent policies are those who have benefited from them or are close to someone who has . 
  it 's not very popular policy at present . 
  i do as the law does apply to me , so obviously i 'd personally prefer it stays the same . 
  but i also support scottish independence and the policy set out in the white paper which would see scotland also grant citizenship to people with scottish grandparents , so i come at it from both sides .
