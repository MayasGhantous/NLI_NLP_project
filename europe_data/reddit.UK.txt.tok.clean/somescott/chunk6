  it actually does have a benefit for reasons i have already outlined . 
  i know most people not involved in government will really never think about it that way , and are more likely to just feel salty about people getting passports , but there is a reason why scotland would employ the same citizenship laws and currently shoves so much time , money and effort into harnessing the `` scottish diaspora '' . 
  definitely . 
  native german speakers have told me something that i think sums it up really well . 
  comparatively , as languages go , english is pretty easy to get to a basic level and the fact that english speakers are the most exposed in the world to their language being mangled is just a bonus on top of that . 
  on the other hand , with languages like german , it 's much harder just to get to that basic level because you have all the things you outlined and more , accusative , dative , genders , grammar grammar grammar . 
  the flip side though is that it is extremely hard to be `` truly fluent '' in english . 
  the language just has such a large vocabulary and hence so many synonyms which means while a speaker can be perfectly understandable it will take much more time and effort to reach the point when they will be considered on par with a native speaker . 
  and honestly unless the uk explodes into flames , literally , it 's not going to much higher . 
  the foreign births register ( which you need to apply to to claim citizenship through a grandparent ) , whether through design or coincidence , exploits something extremely effective , people 's laziness . 
  it requires you to source a lot of original documents ( which costs money because you 're going to have to just order them ) , get scans of id ( which your irish granny will invariably not have , her passport * will * have expired 20 years ago ) and a deluge of other documents all tied together with a nice long application form that needs to be witnessed by a credible person and topped off with a not insignificant 270 euro fee . 
  all that means that you really have to put a fair amount of effort into getting the citizenship . 
  i know a few other people who qualify and even said they would apply for it , but all bar none have had their enthusiasm fizzle out to nothing when they discovered all the bureaucracy involved , and i do n't really blame them . 
  so there is no danger of a deluge for the foreseeable future . 
  that 's generally not how changes in nationality law apply when there is the possibility of retrospectively disenfranchising people from citizenship , and they have n't in ireland in the past . 
  if you look at irish nationality law you 'll see everywhere that `` x applies for people born before year '' and it 's the case in britain ( and i expect most other countries ) as well , because nationality law does n't usually reach back in time to disenfranchise people . 
  and the irish government has said as much which makes it even more unlikely that they 'd suddenly retrospectively change the rules . 
  not that ireland would even want to change the rules because in reality the bump in applications is small in real terms and it 's actually pretty beneficial to have a citizenship policy like they do , which is why an independent scotland would do the same . 
  firstly its very unlikely anyone will use the citizenship to actually move to ireland and even if they did then that would n't even necessarily be a bad thing because any reversal of the brain or youth drain from ireland would be pretty welcome . 
  so what does ireland actually get ? 
  they get a whole lot of people who feel more irish than they otherwise would do from just having an irish grandparent , that 's actually extremely helpful when on a large scale and you can see scotland trying to achieve that too in ways it can since citizenship is off limits ( e.g the `` homecoming '' events , global scots initiative and more ) . 
  even if it is tightened up it will only apply to people born after the law change , which makes it entirely useless in this situation . 
  yeah i 'm sort of conflicted with gaelic in scotland too . 
  i think we 've got the right balance , giving it reasonable support and resources and even helping those who want to learn , but not imagining that it will ever explode or anything . 
  i think it would be a really nice thing to know gaelic , but i was n't born into that environment and realistically i 'm never going to try and learn it because , well , i 'd get much more use out of other languages ( which would also be easier to learn ! ) . 
  i 'm also glad that it was never forced on anyone in school because that seems like a huge waste of time to me . 
  but there is a difference with welsh because it has large communities speaking it , there is a tangible benefit to it . 
  i still do n't really think there is much point in say forcing it on pupils in cardiff , but supporting the continued existence of large bilingual communities in the north of wales is good even if only from the point of view that it is much easier to learn a third ( foreign ) language if you are already bilingual from childhood . 
  it actually would be outrageous . 
  scottish political news is , fairly understandably , not reported fully in ruk . 
  the leader of the scottish conservatives has said that while she does n't want indyref2 , westminster should n't block one . 
  indeed even may 's own scottish secretary has said the exact same thing . 
  and this is not because these two people are extremely-deep-cover nationalists , it 's because they know that westminster blocking an independence referendum would make scottish independence truly inevitable , there would be no bigger pr coup imaginable for the pro-independence side . 
  and may knows that too , she wo n't block one . 
  if things ever got that little-england-on-bad-steroids then london would jump ship and the more logical wall would be between scotland and london and the rest of england . 
   leaving the uk will be 10 times more disastrous for scotland than the uk leaving the eu . 
  honestly there are certain people on reddit who i think would still say this even if queen elizabeth herself transformed into spirit form reaped every first born scottish child . 
  a small price to pay for the overwhelming benefits of a truly infallible union , clearly . 
   the uk 's reasons for leaving the eu are based on facts i think one thing almost all political commentators agreed on was that they had never seen an issue debated with * less * facts . 
  so no . 
   to believe that scotland can possibly leave the uk while maintain eu membership is delusional . 
  no , you are delusional . 
  the eu is not a monolith of obsidian . 
  everything is up for negotiation . 
  i 'm really fed up with people smugly announcing that there is one constant in the entire eu and that is apparently that scotland would have a tough time getting back in . 
  absolute rubbish . 
  we 've just seen david cameron renegotiate and the uk will possibly be offered further concessions . 
  and regardless some form of special relationship from outside the eu will likely be negotiated when article 50 is triggered . 
  there is absolutely no reason why scotland can not negotiate entry into the eu in the interm period between a referendum and independence . 
  in fact it is blatantly the most simple and obvious solution . 
  * anything * is possible in the eu if there is political will , and there is no serious political will to pointlessly inconvenience scotland . 
  the only people i have seen advocate that are a very small minority of bitter english people who will now be entirely disenfranchised from the eu anyway . 
  and before you say spain , do n't . 
  spain only cares about unilateral declarations of independence . 
  a scotland gaining independence from a legal referendum is of no interest to them . 
  you can not expect every single voter in an entire country to vote the same way on a serious issue in a truly democratic referendum . 
  scotland is not a nation of clones or north korea . 
  this is what is so hard to explain to people . 
  you 're never going to get anything like 90 % / 10 % in serious referendums . 
  if you did it would be a massive red flag for fraud . 
  the exception being the occasional crazy ones you find popping up in countries like switzerland because of how easy they are to start and the point-proving ones like the referendum in the falklands . 
  we can do analogies too . 
  how about scotland runs out the burning house . 
  national referendums on issues such as this will never be 99 % / 1 % , that only happens in ridiculous referendums like you occasionally see in switzerland because of how easy they are to introduce . 
  the result in scotland is as decisive an endorsement for the eu as it is possible for an entire diverse country to give the eu at this ( very eurosceptic time ) . 
  yeah , merkel seems to have the right idea though and is being reasonable . 
  i imagine article 50 will be triggered when merkel stops being responsive to informal preparations . 
  i think rees-mogg is the honourable option now . 
  we 've voted to screw ourselves over , we may as well take it on the chin and roll with it . 
  ** [ [ britannia intensifies ] ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1378256/images/o-jacob-reesmogg-facebook.jpg ) **, 
   greatly benefit ukip , which i do n't think anyone realistically want to see as the opposition . 
  do n't worry , ukip will never get more than a small handful of mps , if that . 
  the one saving grace of the fptp system is that ukip is screwed over by it about as much as it is possible to be screwed over by an electoral system . 
  seriously , look at the results of the last election . 
  they got 3.88 million votes and only ** 1 mp ** . 
  conversely the lib dems got 2.4 million votes and 8 mps while the snp who are the exact opposites to ukip in the fptp lottery ( and they admit it and want it changed , to their credit ) got 1.45 million votes and ** 56 mps ** . 
  spain already has a work-around they established during the last independence referendum . 
  they have no problem with a legal mutually agreed splitting of a union , as was the case with scotland as they agreed the terms of the referendum with the uk government . 
  this sets no worrying precedent for catalonia as spain just is n't going to agree mutual terms with catalonia for a referendum , they 're just going to deny/refuse to cooperate with any referendum . 
  possible point of contention avoided , in their eyes at least . 
  i 'm sure spain would probably rather scotland did n't become independent nonetheless , but they know trying to cause problems for a newly independent scotland would do themselves more harm than good and probably be counterproductive . 
  it would suddenly bring an awful lot of attention to the catalonian question and scrutiny to how spain deals with it , which is something spain really does n't want . 
  also just thought you 'd like to see , i 've been reading an article on the first minister going to brussels and this is what we 're hearing right now ,  schulz said he would welcome and listen to the first minister . 
  asked whether scotland could hope for either continued eu membership or special status , he said : `` it is absolutely a domestic issue for the uk . 
  everything that concerns the internal debate has to happen within the framework of institutions within the uk . '' that is exactly the same weak vague talk we had last time , it needs to change and soon if independence is to stand a chance . 
  thank you !, 
  it did n't last time which was extremely damaging to the independence campaign . 
  that would work too but i was thinking that a statement from juncker would be more concentrated and less showy than outpourings of support from every european leader . 
  as nice as that would be i understand there has to be a balance between supporting scotland 's position and not wanting to alienate and overly insult the rest of the uk which would still be a very important partner for the eu . 
  but either way works , as long as the people of scotland are sufficiently assured of their continued eu membership before an independence vote . 
  anything less and there is a very good chance that it will fail . 
  if you have the time to help i 'd suggest possibly contacting your elected representatives ? 
  what scotland really needs is firm assurances and commitments of continued membership upon independence from the likes of juncker . 
  but every positive statement from prominent european politicians along the way * really * helps . 
  it 's really nice seeing this positive sentiment here and in person in europe , but during the last referendum there was a stoney silence from virtually all people of power in the eu and it 's nation states . 
  that was n't enough then and it would be extremely damaging if it happened again this time , when we could be voting in no small part for independence as a means to remain in the eu . 
  seriously i hope the snp just bite the bullet and campaign that they 'll seek to use the euro . 
  the only problem is there are ** an awful lot ** of people in scotland ( like the rest of the uk ) who think the euro is literally a worthless , awful , cursed , decrepit joke of a currency and that adopting it is akin to wilfully demolishing your entire economy . 
  that will be hard to overcome , but i think it 's possible , especially now that the pound has lost some of it 's almost mythical sheen and is n't viewed as some infallible god-like currency now that we 've all seen how it can nose dive like the best of them . 
  pls send help .
