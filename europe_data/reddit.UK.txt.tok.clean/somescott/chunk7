   you would get that membership right now , that is pretty much guaranteed with this referendum that 's just your word . 
  all the good will in the world means nothing unless juncker or someone of similar stature actually says it . 
  they do n't need to make a big song and a dance about it , just a simple statement that scotland will be given at least the opportunity for seamless membership ( e.g negotiations with that intention prior to formal independence ) . 
  anything less than that and the anti-independence side will jump on it , just as they did last time . 
  without that absolute assurance scotland risks being a newly independent nation shut out of both unions in a turbulent time . 
  even if that is only for a few years , can you think of anything more economically turbulent ? 
  no previous anti-independence voters are going to be convinced by that , and even worse some previous pro-independence supporters may become disillusioned . 
  why put in so much effort and have so much faith in an organisation that cant even be bothered to assure that a nation that is ** already a member ** wont be forced out into the cold when it tries desperately and risks a hell of a lot just to avoid leaving . 
  speedy accession is n't enough . 
  scotland needs assurances that they 'll have at least the opportunity of automatic accession ( e.g an agreement that there will be negotiations with scotland after a yes vote and before formal independence with a view of continuing membership seamlessly ) . 
  anything else is frankly very unattractive . 
  be a newly independent nation forced out of the eu for two , maybe three , more ? 
  years before eventually being allowed back in . 
  i can think of nothing more excessively disruptive and economically damaging . 
  if the eu is serious about helping scotland it needs to walk the walk , not just talk the talk . 
  and sadly i 'm not confident of that happening . 
  deep down i feel merkel is too pragmatic and steeped in real politik to waste much thought on a * potential * nation of 5 million when there is a brexit to negotiate . 
  scotland is not , or more properly , would not be , just another candidate country . 
  it is a country that has been a part of and engaged with the eu positively for decades and one that has just voted overwhelmingly to continue that in one of the most eurosceptic climates we have ever experienced . 
  if all that was ignored for the sake of due process ( which , lets be honest , is n't exactly gospel in the eu ) then scotland would definitely feel let down and would not vote for independence . 
  there is no logic to the previous anti-independence voters , who need to be convinced , in leaving the uk just to be met with a shut door from the eu while the bureaucracy churns away for some years before it * eventually * decides to open , that is not how scotland wants to or should be treated . 
  we need public assurances of this by someone like juncker ** before ** a vote on independence . 
  the yes side will loose again if we ca n't be sure of automatic or vastly accelerated eu membership . 
  no previous `` no '' voters will be convinced to switch sides if the threat of being left out in the cold from not only the uk but the eu too is a possibility , even if it is only for a few years , that could do enough damage . 
  the eu can do a lot . 
  it is likely the only way for scotland to remain in the eu will be through a successful independence referendum . 
  to win that independence referendum the yes side ** needs ** clarity and certainty from the eu . 
  not like last time when there were vague whispers but nothing concrete out of fear of upsetting westminster . 
  we need juncker to say that upon independence scotland will be granted continued / automatic eu membership or at the very least a very accelerated ascension . 
  we also need assurances that no one ( looking at you , spain ) is going to entertain the possibility of vetoing scotland 's membership . 
  the yes campaign will not win if we just get stoney silence from the eu leadership again . 
  we can not campaign for independence in no small part to retain eu membership while not being assured of that very membership and risking entering into some non-membership limbo . 
  honestly a lot of the reduced turn out in comparison to the rest of the uk ( lets not forget the turnout was very respectable in its own right and still very high ) can be put down to people assuming remain was a done deal . 
  there was precious little public campaigning in scotland . 
  i never saw a leave campaigner or even a leave poster . 
  every single party in the scottish parliament supported eu membership so there was no prospect of having a televised debate or debate of any kind between them , they all agreed . 
  add to this the fact all the bookies and most of the polls showed remain would have a comfortable victory , there was absolutely no sense in scotland that we were at any risk of leaving the eu . 
  by all means let westminster block it . 
  i can think of few things that would boost support for independence more than a eurosceptic right wing conservative trying to block a referendum by a scottish government elected with the largest popular mandate in western europe . 
  if they do actually try and block it , they 'll soon cave , they 'll have to . 
  did you even live in scotland ? 
  i can assure you as someone who lived through the campaign and watched every debate , the eu was definitely one of the three or so pillars of the campaign . 
  scotland is the most pro-eu part of the uk as we have just witnessed , both sides desperately wanted to appeal to that , and it turns out the pro-independence camp were absolutely right . 
  actually it is quite onerous , you need originals of everything you said ( aka you need to order and pay for them , i hope ireland actually has a record of my ancient rural gran 's birth certificate ... ) . 
  on top of that you need three proofs of address for you and your parent which is n't so bad but also need a notarized copy of a current passport or drivers license for you , your parent and grandparent . 
  my grandparent does n't drive and if she even still has a passport it will be at least a decade out of date . 
  i 'm going to have to call the consulate and see if they have a way around that . 
  sadly i do n't think my families suggestion of taking a picture of her with her 9 children and bagillion grandchildren and daring the embassy to say she 's not irish would fly ... 
  an independent scotland may take on similar citizenship law to ireland . 
  so the best case scenario would be the possibility of a scottish passport if you have a parent or grandparent born in scotland . 
  otherwise no luck . 
  not most , all but one . 
  i 'm assuming you do n't live in scotland because all of the traditional media is pretty fiercely anti-snp and anti-independence , it 's part of what made the rise of the snp and the close-ness of the referendum so surprising , they did it all against an extremely hostile media that obviously has significantly more reach than / r/scotland which was at the time an even smaller sub than it is now . 
  also if we 're talking about subs , expressing any pro-independence view on / r/unitedkingdom was just as bad , if not worse , than being a unionist in / r/scotland . 
  as someone who has debated and discussed the issue countless times , even i got absolutely exhausted and completely worn down trying to represent the alternate view there . 
   just reading scottish media smacked of vitriol for people voting ` no ' . 
  honestly ? 
  you 're getting to the stage where it sounds like you are making things up . 
  scottish media was ** overwhelmingly ** pro-union . 
  just look at [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_endorsements_in_the_scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#newspapers ) . 
  there was * one * newspaper that endorsed independence , the herald . 
  the rest endorsed the union . 
   going around scotland you would see ` yes ' plastered everywhere , not so much ` no ' . 
  paid adverts for ` no ' were defaced as well . 
  again entirely depends where you were , i saw more no posters than yes . 
   with the scottish referendum , the ` yes ' supporters were very loud and aggressive to people voting ` no ' , and consequently the ` no ' vote was the ` shy vote ' meaning it was underrepresented in the polls . 
  that 's an extremely blinkered view , both sides had their loud components but overall it was an extremely surprisingly civil campaign for such an emotive and important issue . 
  it also entirely depended on where you lived , i 'd say there was as much of a shy yes vote than a shy no vote . 
  for example where i lived some ( not most , i 'm not doing the tarring everyone with the same brush ) would call you delusional and stupid if you said you were voting yes . 
   another point is that the older folk were voting ` no ' in the scottish referendum - a group that is generally underrepresented in polling . 
  the older folk are in support of leaving the eu this time around , so possibly this might be a cause of inaccuracy in the polls . 
  that 's an interesting point actually . 
   whilst i could be very wrong , i do n't think that we will see a similar effect to what we saw in the scottish independence vote . 
  i think we will largely but it would be very interesting if we did n't , it would be a massive political upset , for example no book makers are predicting leave and never have . 
  undecideds !, 
  in a referendum like this , leave needs a lead of more than one or two points above remain to be indicating a path to victory . 
  the undecideds who vote largely vote for the status-quo , we 've seen this even in the scottish referendum where the actual result was n't as close as the polls were predicting . 
  i think the result will be close now though , but a peak of a lead of 2 points is simply not enough to overcome the weight of the undecideds . 
   might cause a few riots and potentially terrorist action but those would only turn public opinion against them . 
  dear god it would n't get to that stage . 
  if david cameron denied another independence referendum after brexit , essentially forcing us to leave the eu , that would be a huge boost to the independence movement . 
  can you think of anything more likely to convince people to vote yes to independence than david cameron saying you are not allowed to vote on it ? 
  after that all the independence camp would have to do is bide their time before westminster eventually caves in . 
  the snp is far too dominant a force in scottish politics to allow the issue to be ignored or swept under the rug by westminster if this scenario was to pan out . 
  this is a special case . 
  during the independence referendum there were a couple of main pillars of the debate , one was definitely eu membership . 
  a big part of the `` better together '' campaign was that an independent scotland might not get eu membership for some time and that delay or even ridiculous rumours of a veto would be extremely costly and risky . 
  so if in fact it turns out that after voting no to independence in no small part to avoid endangering our eu membership but are dragged out nevertheless against the will of the scottish people a couple of years later , then it is entirely legitimate to want another independence referendum . 
  they vote enough to give remain a boost of at least few points from what the opinion polls say , and they 're almost all predicting a remain win anyway . 
  just look at the bookies , they 're generally predicting an 80 % chance remain wins , that 's a lot . 
  i would be * extremely * surprised if leave won . 
  if i was a gambling person i would definitely put money on remain but there would n't be much of a return anyway . 
  no , not really . 
  pay attention to the undecideds . 
  if we start seeing clear `` out '' wins with low undecided figures then it 's time to pay attention . 
  the undecideds end up voting mostly to remain and you can see that in the polls , the few ones with low undecided figures show remain victories . 
  queenception . 
  also i love imagining how excited that photographer must have been when he realised the queen was going to walk past it and he could get that shot . 
  i thought i was clear i do n't think plumbers are necessarily more `` stupid '' than gender studies majors . 
  what i said is some people are more interested in politics than others and we 've reached a stage where people who are n't interested in politics feel safe enough to not bother to really fully understand the power of their vote .
