  there is no fear of a bad change spurring them on to really look into it , lots of people assume comfortable centrism is now a fact of life . 
  at no point did i say a lack of education means someone is stupid . 
  those are obviously extreme examples and i do n't think it 's as simple as the whole stupid people stupid vote and smart people smart vote . 
  i think it comes down more to interest . 
  i 'd say , on balance , if you compare a group of gender studies majors and a group of plubmbers , the gender studies major are probably going to spend more time considering their vote and have a better understanding of just how potentially powerful that vote is . 
  it 's not so much that some people are stupid , it 's just that this long period of stability and centrist governments has lead people who are n't naturally interested in politics to assume that nothing bad will happen if they vote for a far-right candidate and their comfortable centrist world will continue in perpetuity regardless . 
  i suppose that is right but it still shows that people are n't engaging fully and properly with politics . 
  political parties generally take some time to evolve . 
  the question of immigration has only recently exploded and it 's easy for people to latch on to , deciding you 're `` against immigration '' is a lot easier than discussing taxation , social security etc. 
  so people are voting for the most obvious anti-immigration choice , and completely ignoring every other issue . 
  and i still say this is a choice of ignorance because i simply do not believe that even a majority of these voters would like an fpo governed country , i do not think they would be happy if the rest of their policies were implemented . 
  people simply assume that their relatively comfortable , stable , centrist governments are somehow divinely guaranteed to continue forever and so voting for a far-right candidate as a single issue voter will just `` shake up '' the system and `` wake up '' politicians . 
  i do n't believe they have any idea just how powerful their vote is , and that if enough people do the same as them austria or any other democratic european country could end up with a far-right government with consequences they never even bothered to consider . 
  people are n't being ignored . 
  i struggle to properly explain this phenomenon but i do not believe people in austria or most other fully democratic european nations can * at all * claim they are ignored . 
  they can join whatever political party they want , they can vote for whoever they want ( and there are a lot of options ) or if they feel that their views are sufficiently unique enough to not be represented properly by the vast array of parties already available to them , they can with some effort create their own . 
  it seems to me that it 's become fashionable in a way to be `` disillusioned with politics '' . 
  but really that just betrays a lack of effort to educate yourself or keep on top of it . 
  more broadly people are deciding they do n't like immigrants and are voting for the people with the loudest most simplistic message possible that fits in with that , especially if those people tell them it 's okay to be `` disillusioned with politics '' , it 's not you 're fault , do n't bother putting any effort in , just vote for us . 
  this is what we end up with , or almost end up with in this case . 
  well obviously . 
  english is the de facto universal language . 
  to change that you 'd have to change curriculums in schools across europe and wait a generation or more until those new language x knowing students become the meps of tomorrow . 
  definitely satire . 
  but i think it illustrates really well how ideologically opposed westminster is to * actual * federalism , even after we were promised the moon if we voted no last time . 
  it 's very telling that provinces in canada have more federal power over the whole than scotland , a nation , in a self styled family/union of * nations * . 
  the issue i was talking about is depression being the sole reason for the assisted suicide rather than accompanying a terminal illness . 
  i did n't say it did, 
  you need to control for mental illness which is entirely controllable with medication . 
  i do n't think there are many places that include depression but i believe either in belgium or the netherlands or both it is possible . 
  but only if your depression is severe and deemed incurable with current treatment . 
  it 's obviously a very contentious issue , but there is no need to cut off your nose to spite your face , you can have legislation excluding mental illness and leave that debate to continue . 
  missed an opportunity there to have a saltire on the door as rose letting go of the * union * jack . 
  i 've had a glance and it 's certainly seems less extreme than it was , but lets not pretend it 's not solidly right wing when it counts . 
  on the nhs thread most of the top comments were talking about how the nhs needs to move to a different model of funding , with some complaints about public sector pensions thrown in . 
  i mean it now looks like you can post a centre or even left of centre viewpoint without being annihilated , but politics is more than brexit and that sub is definitely not neutral . 
  not that thats a bad thing , all subs will always have a slant , i 'm just trying to explain this to people who inexplicably believe / r/ukpolitics is somehow the only impartial and neutral place on reddit . 
  in general yes but as you can probably recognise from the names of the commenters with british flags here , there has been another about turn . 
  the more rightwing posters in / r/unitedkingdom , the people who were most determined in their anti-independence posting in 2014 , have weirdly collected here . 
  so i actually get more uninformed hate in / r/europe than / r/unitedkingdom , which is a strange experience . 
  and really i do n't mind the hate as much as the uninformed hate . 
  thankfully as a side effect of suddenly becoming pro-indy / r/unitedkingdom has mostly educated itself about the most basic anti-independence myths . 
  not so the case from british posters here . 
  i ptsd from simply seeing the word `` spain '' from the amount of times i was told spain would veto scotland 's eu membership `` just because '' in 2014 , now i only hear that in / r/europe from british posters . 
  but worst of all is the rightwing brits posting here with ** absolutely zero self awareness ** . 
  i 'll admit that / r/unitedkingdom is firmly centre left , and now recently pro-indy . 
  / r/scotland is extremely pro-snp . 
  and so on . 
  yet these people are touting / r/ukpolitics as some unique bastion of perfect neutrality when it is perfectly obvious that it is actually a tory echochamber , a mirror image of / r/unitedkingdom . 
  the level of doublethink is frightening . 
  subs developing into echochambers is normal and will always happen , but not having the self awareness to recognise that is shocking and all to evident in this thread . 
  significant ? 
  you can find the crazies anywhere . 
  if you think there are a * significant * number of extreme scottish nationalists then england must be virtually national socialist in your eyes with the number of immigrant hating ukip/leave people . 
  or maybe you 're just projecting an opinion into facts you wish into existence ? 
  no the sub still likes to mock the nus , i think thats a pretty universal thing regardless of political orientation . 
  as an independence supporter i 'm surprised by the sudden about turn too , i think it will tone down eventually , it 's mostly part of the broader reaction against brexit . 
  however , i 'm also thinking it might be some sort of ying-yang universe balancing mechanism for the absolute toxic vitriol anyone posting a pro-independence viewpoint in that sub had to face in 2014 . 
  i tried always to represent the independence viewpoint in that sub because most other people who tried understandably gave up , and normally i can debate until the cows come home . 
  but seriously i was as close to exhausted as you can get from the internet by all the ( mainly ) poorly informed hatred that came my way . 
  so i 'll take this perhaps excessive welcoming for pro-independence views over extreme hatred any day . 
  yes , as a centre-left person i 'm the first to admit that / r/unitedkingdom is definitely generally a centre-left echo chamber . 
  it had a wobble when corbyn was in vogue , perhaps tilting a little more left , but now it 's firmly back to centre-left . 
  i do n't think it 's necessarily a bad thing , subs naturally develop that way , it 's just human nature as you can see all across reddit . 
  i 'm sure there are a million reasons why but it 's stupid to stand on an imaginary moral high ground and degrade it . 
  however , i am pretty terrified by the level of doublethink required by regular / r/ukpolitics posters now saying here that / r/ukpolitics is somehow a bastion of diversity . 
  the lack of self awareness is frightening . 
   and varied political debate and discussion to / r/ukpolitics . 
   and varied political debate  ** varied ** what . 
  that sub is just missing one letter , it 's more accurately called / r/ukipolitics . 
  i 'll happily grant you that / r/unitedkingdom is definitely firmly centre-left and you wont have be received very well promoting conservative ideas . 
  but for gods sake , do n't delude yourself into thinking / r/ukpolitics is anything other than the right wing mirror image of / r/unitedkingdom . 
  there is nothing especially balanced about either of them . 
  i ship muncker . 
  i actually swear we need some sort of sidebar to educate people on this . 
  i see it in every single thread that mentions scotland , someone will claim with excessive confidence that they know spain will veto scotland . 
  i would n't even try on here , there is a dedicated contingent of hyper-unionist brits . 
  they also say the same incorrect things over an over again , you can play bingo in any thread that mentions scotland , just look for `` scotland will have to join the euro '' or `` spain will block scotland '' or '' [ insert some variant of how scotland 's economy will explode then implode then settle as an irradiated pile of dust - surprise bonus point if oil revenue is mentioned - automatic win if the commenter claims the snp base their entire economy on oil ] '' . 
  it 's an odd state of affairs where / r/europe is more hostile to even the idea of scottish independence than / r/unitedkingdom now . 
  yeah , from my experience they 're just held in halls attached to the churches that are also used for things like scouts . 
  it 's not as if you need to march down the aisle and cast your vote on the altar . 
   i guess the idea is make referendums over and over until they get 51 % to back a declaration of independence . 
  considering they have n't been allowed even one proper binding referendum , that 's a bit rich . 
  technically true , but realistically no . 
  spain is a nation talking to a region with a very strict constitution against succession . 
  the uk is a union ( or a family , if you 're better together ) of nations . 
  it 's an important distinction , and it 's why none of the parties in the scottish parliament , * including * the scottish conservatives ** & unionists ** think westminster should never fully block a scottish referendum . 
  it would be hugely counter productive , it would increase support for independence and result in massive political pressure on westminster . 
  the uk government would have to back down . 
  not technically , but you need to see the reality here . 
  just like technically the uk government could impose a 100 % tax rate and crush any protests with force . 
  while in reality they u-turn on a modest rise in national insurance because of political pressure . 
  same to you . 
   as for currency you will have to join the euro to join the eu . 
  in a non-debatey way i thought you might want to know that 's false though . 
  there is a technical obligation to eventually join the euro , but that 's purely symbolic as first you must join the exchange rate mechanism ( erm ) for some years to ease the transition . 
  and joining the erm is entirely voluntary . 
  this is why sweden can say , as it has , that it will not join the euro without the approval of it 's citizens via a referendum . 
  because joining the euro is entirely voluntary , even without an official `` opt-out '' . 
  the uk 's `` opt-out '' was purely symbolic .
