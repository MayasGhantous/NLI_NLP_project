  you say this as if it 's a certainty , i 'm not entirely sure why scotland could n't have its own currency , just a scottish pound . 
  to the extent they agree to cede certain powers to the feds , sure . 
  ca n't have a federation without federal power , but you can maintain huge amounts of domestic autonomy while being part of a federation . 
  you have to understand that currently we have a fair amount , but as an independent nation within the eu we would have much , much more domestic control than we currently do . 
  outside of the eu , sure , we 'd have more , but then it brings big benefits too . 
   however if we ca n't trust the populace to be as informed as the politicians then the populace is in no position to vote on which politician can best make the decisions . 
  what do you prefer , to have heart surgery performed by a random guy on the street , or to have heart surgery performed by a surgeon who was recommended by a random guy on the street ? 
  i know which i 'd pick . 
  i agree it 's not ideal , and it horrifies me that random people i meet who 're barely literate and get all of their political opinions from the sun have exactly the same power as myself , but then how does one change that without disenfranchisement ( education , obviously , but it 's easier said than done ) ? 
  technocracy is tempting , but i think it could be effected just by a culture change , rather than requiring china style single party rule . 
  i mean , i get angry every time a non-economist is put as chancellor , if we all did that , then maybe we 'd start to see decent people in the position rather than men who have history degrees and worked at department stores before becoming it . 
  anyway , i wo n't turn this into a rant about how i 'd perfect the uk 's system of government because we 're still too fucking backward to get rid of fptp , let alone make any really serious changes . 
   since when are we comparing to germany ? 
  since i brought them in as an example of long term wealth transfer with the aim of decreasing wealth disparity and encourage growth , which is exactly what we 're talking about here whether you accept it or not . 
   i am not aware that sweden joined up with corsica firstly , corsica is not a country , it is a region of france . 
  secondly , you should be rather embarrassed if you 're not aware that sweden joined with france , because it was done in 1995 when sweden acceded . 
  the maastricht treaty was signed in '92 as well , so it 's not even like you can claim you joined a different organisation ( eec , or ecsc , etc. ), 
   or that the eu is a single country . 
  it 's not , it 's a supranational organisation for the time being . 
   not the bailout money , apart from the one from the imf and the eu . 
  i do n't care if the eurozone countries want to transfer debt to their taxpayers . 
  i think it 's stupid and not really efficient the way it has been handled , but it is not my problem . 
  the fact that eu money however is used for a not efficient bank save is my problem . 
  i 'm sorry i do n't fully understand what you 're saying here , you appear to support the idea of bailouts but only within the eurozone , would that be accurate ? 
  in that case you do realise all the money was coming from national governments agreeing on a voluntary basis , right ? 
  the eu budget nothing compared to the bailouts and would never be sufficient to bail out a bank . 
   link 1 [ response to this . 
  ] ( http://www.jonworth.eu/sick-of-eu-doesnt-sign-off-books-therefore-corrupteviluselessnasty-delete-as-applicable/ )  this is a study how organised crime misuse eu funds . 
  that has particularely ( as far as i 've understood ) been the case of southern italy and corsica . 
  i am not asking you to read the report , it is a credible proof at least . 
  sure , organised criminals defraud the eu , so what ? 
  whats your point ? 
  they also defraud national governments , and since as that no doubt credible report states , the european court of auditors reports ** 3 cases ** per year to the anti-fraud office . 
  something to work on ? 
  sure , as it is for all governments , but an argument against the eu ? 
  goodness no . 
   `` a number of countries in southern europe -- greece , italy , portugal and spain -- are shown to have serious deficits in public sector accountability and deep-rooted problems of inefficiency , malpractice and corruption , which are neither sufficiently controlled nor sanctioned . '', 
  so here you have an actually valid point at last . 
  but here 's my retort : we can work on that , we can help them improve , and moreover we * need * to help them improve because we * need * the eu if we want to maintain our wealth , maintain our security , and maintain our influence in the world . 
  in short , it 's worth putting up with having to help countries fix their corruption in order to maintain the eu . 
   well , the evidence is that they have been on the receiving end for decades . 
  again , you 're simplifying and conflating . 
  france has been on the receiving end of the cap for decades , but that 's intentional . 
  poland currently receives 6 billion euro a year , and estonia was receiving ** forty times ** the amount that spain was in 2009 , the height of the recession . 
  to act like structural investment 15 years ago to build highways in italy or greece should have immediately gotten them to some imaginary point where they would be as productive as denmark is just silly . 
  the eu budget is tiny compared with national budgets , and any sort of investment , be it in agricultural subsidies ( the majority of which go to france ) or structural investment ( the majority of which has generally and still is going to post-soviet countries ) , is not going to raise gdp growth to 10 % just with the wave of a magic wand . 
   why ca n't southern italy be estonia ? 
  or greece ? 
  because italy and greece as both highly developed countries , and estonia was n't in ' 91 . 
  seriously , are you that unfamiliar with economics that you do n't understand that it 's far easier to increase growth rates with limited investment in developing or poorly developed countries than it is in highly developed countries ? 
  estonia does have ( imo ) better economic policy than say italy or greece , but that does n't mean i 'm going to say `` oh well fuck it then '' - italy and spain are two very large , very powerful economies which generate huge amounts of wealth and are vital to the eu , a few reported occurrences of corruption in france or italy and a slowly improving but nonetheless problematic tendency toward corruption and inefficiency should n't dent a much larger move toward a european federation . 
  i disagree , i mean while scotland may well leave the united kingdom that 's largely just to increase independent domestic policy rather than anything else . 
  a federation would be perfect for scotland , and there are a number of us who would seek to maintain the uk but in a federation so as to keep scotland in the uk while enabling scotland to pursue the independent domestic policies which many scots seek to pursue . 
  if scotland does become independent then one of the first things it will do is apply for eu membership and it 'll probably rapidly adopt the euro , so long as spain does n't fuck it up for us because it 's insecure . 
   politicians are no more or less capable of making an informed decision than the rest of the populace . 
  i beg to differ on capability , but even if we were to accept that , the fact is that politicians * do * make informed decisions because its their job to be informed , some do that better than others sure , but that 's their job , it 's what they do every day . 
  does franz the plumber spend all day making sure he 's informed ? 
  no , he spends all day fixing toilets and installing pipes , because that 's his job . 
  the idea that they 're equally informed , or even * could * be equally informed and maintain their different jobs is preposterous . 
  i do n't think you 're even objecting to the idea of representative democracy , i reckon you just do n't like the way it 's currently executed , and you know what ? 
  neither do i. 
  but that does n't mean it 's inferior to direct democracy , not by a long shot . 
   greece , southern italy , and corsica has been on the receiving end since forever , so long that we can start talking about perment transfers . 
  germany is * still * transferring wealth to the east . 
  it takes a long time to build up an economy and a country , and the wealth we 're transferring has been paltry by comparison with what germany has been sending east for the last 20 years . 
   where have the money gone ? 
  which money , the cap money , the bailout money , the infrastructure money ? 
   i can say with certainty that they have not been used efficient , and i think in a lot of cases , they have just gone to someones pocket . 
  do you have evidence to support these beliefs or do you just think it ? 
   there is one thing aiding regions in a way that they learn to help themselves , but that has clearly not been the case here again , that 's an opinion which is easy to throw out but meaningless without reasoning or evidence . 
  as is , i 'm sorry to say , everything you say after it . 
  indeed so . 
  that 's the precise problem - there 's a reason we elect politicians , they 're there to be experts on politics . 
  when you want open heart surgery d'you trust the one surgeon or d'you just ask 100 people which option would be best ? 
  obvious answer is obvious . 
  same with politics , do we trust that the guy who does it all day every day for the last 20 years probably has the best idea , or do we just ask another random 100 people ? 
  to me , obvious answer again . 
  one of the best parts , at least . 
  we help other countries to get rich so we can get richer . 
  please to be educating yourself . 
  scotland could do just fine out of the eu , although would probably rather be in it . 
  catalonia i 'm not so sure about . 
  at a few million people in each state , both would be quite well suited to becoming small eu states , but that 's way in the future . 
  as i said further up i think cybertroll really overplayed and over-conflated the various independence movements going on around the eu , while some , like the scottish one , actually have a serious chance of gaining independence within a few years , others such as flanders , basque , or even ( realistically ) catalonia , just are n't happening anytime in the near future . 
   this is certainly the viewpoint of the pro-eu world . 
  oh come on , it 's a reality . 
  we 're an island nation of 60 million people and the 8th largest economy in the world and that 's relatively rapidly going further and further down compared with other countries . 
  now you can take the position that we do n't * need * to be relevant in the world and we can just stay out of things and live our lives , but if you want to try and claim that the uk can remain an important world force without being in the eu then you 've got some very big gaps to jump . 
  keep trying if you desire , i think your chances of preventing the eu going federal are very very small , but by all means if you desire to try then do . 
  unless the eu collapses then yes , federation is inevitable . 
   we have a recent surge of independentism in catalonia and scotland sorry but i 've got to take issue with this because they 're very different things . 
  catalonia is much more like northern ireland than scotland , where independence could actually occur in the next few years . 
  it 's not even like either situation is recent , they 've both existed for a fairly long time , it 's just that in scotland we 're actually going to have a referendum on the issue in a couple of years which may well pass , i ca n't see spain letting go of catalonia any time soon . 
  agreed , people seem to view dd as just an * obviously * better system and i think the real drawbacks behind it just are n't considered often enough . 
  100 regions of 5 million , unified into 10 bodies of approximately 40-60 million people . 
  or by small states do you mean hundreds of thousands of people ? 
  realistically for healthcare , abortion , and euthanasia it basically has to be done federally because of ease of movement within our states . 
  people already just hop the border for abortion ( ireland to uk ) and euthanasia ( france to switzerland ) , and i 'm sure health tourism is n't that difficult because i keep hearing about it going on - might as well have federally administered health care - think of the cost savings and negotiation power of a national heath service which serves half a billion people !, 
  * i * do n't like the idea of politicians losing power to people . 
  switzerland has some great aspects , i mean from what i understand cantons are basically autonomous entities within the nation running how they want to within a national system and i think that 's a great idea , but the direct democracy aspect i have issues with , i trust you 're aware enough of the minaret ban to understand why .
