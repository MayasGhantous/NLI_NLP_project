  great , fantastic . 
  in so many ways czech has been the shining star of post-communist countries , as someone who has no connection to it besides having a few friends from there and it being in the eu , i can happily ( and no doubt quite vacuously ) say that i 'm really proud of how much that country has achieved in the last 20 years . 
  boris johnson, 
  russia does n't want to join the eu , and the eu wo n't have russia , if it 's sensible . 
  capital of prussia , yes . 
  a great defeat to be able to inflict upon the germans that the russians were able to claim it as their own . 
  yeah , such a shame that it 's completely impossible to have smoking restaurants and pubs * at the same time * as having other , separate , non-smoking restaurants and pubs , is n't it ? 
  how likely is is that ms. brad\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1 will die in a car crash or similar ? 
  this * is * news if it is the case . 
  hehe , i am * not * a nice guy . 
  i do n't go around worrying about everyone i wo n't meet , but i do concern myself with shitheads like the ones who made and published this picture . 
  i 'm not defending them , i 'm attacking a newspaper which thinks childish 19th century racist imagery is socially acceptable in this day and age . 
  well , i guess i care . 
  i want the world to be better than that , and i want people to not be racist shit heads . 
  i 'd say this makes me sad to be human , but really it just makes me sad that there are people stupid and insensitive enough out there to think this is valid or funny . 
  it 's equating black people with monkeys , a time honoured comparison drawn by racists across the globe . 
  the point being , that the newspaper is dealing in the explicitly racist terminology and imagery of the past ( well , the past in most places ... ), 
  this paper was n't making fun of the few guys who had a fight though , it was making fun of black people . 
  it was drawing the comparison between black people and monkeys , and that 's fucking racist . 
  eastern europe is racist enough without people actually justifying cuntish actions like this . 
  jesus , no . 
  do you not understand that making the implication `` black people = monkeys '' is completely racist ? 
  joking or otherwise , it is . 
  there 's an issue ? 
  sure . 
  some black guys got in a fight . 
  the response ? 
  ukrainian newspaper makes the pictorial equivalent of saying `` niggers = monkeys '' . 
  the picture is racist against all black people who ever lived though , so if she 's not she 's being wilfully obtuse , and if she is she 's being racist . 
  seriously ? 
  you 're saying that calling all black people is ok because a few people had a fight ? 
  i 'm quite disappointed because i actually thought you were ok . 
  if you get rid of the people you 'd get rid of the religion , sure , but note too that you can get rid of the religion without getting rid of the people . 
  we 're getting rid of christianity fairly rapidly in the eu , but that does n't mean we 're going to stop having the people who were or would have been christian . 
  at a very much slower rate . 
  1/3 muslim university students think [ killing for religion ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1340599/wikileaks-1-3-british-muslim-students-killing-islam-40-want-sharia-law.html ) is justified . 
  40 % of british muslims [ want sharia ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/poll-reveals-40pc-of-muslims-want-sharia-law-in-uk.html ) in at least parts of the uk . 
  20 % of british muslims have sympathy for the suicide bombers who killed dozens of innocent people in london . 
  also this : [ `` almost one in four british muslims believe that last year 's 7/7 attacks on london were justified because of british support for the u.s.-led war on terror . 
  '' ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/14/opinion/main1893879.shtml&amp;date=2011-04-06 ) [ here 's a poll which shows that 1/4 british muslims believe suicide bombings are justified ] ( http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf#page=60 ) [ 5 % of british muslims would n't report planned terrorist acts if they knew they were going to happen ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/?id=1956912005 ) [ 25 % believe that that muslims have no obligation to report terrorists to the police ] ( http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/reviews/2004/guardian%20muslims%20poll%20nov%2004/guardian%20muslims%20nov04.asp ) [ oh and 37 % believe jews in britain are a `` legitimate target '' for killing . 
  ] ( http://www.populuslimited.com/pdf/2006_02_07_times.pdf ) this is n't backward goat fuckers from mountainous tribal regions of pakistan i 'm talking about , this is modern `` integrated '' muslim people on the streets of the uk who go to tescos and work at the council or the shop down the road . 
  seriously , this horseshit about islam being no worse than any other religion is just that , complete horse shit . 
  islam is objectively worse for the simple reason that it 's believers actually believe . 
  a moderate muslim would be a fundamentalist christian , the depth of belief differs to such an extent , and frankly i 'm bloody tired of apologists defending criticism of this death cult which is fundamentally incompatable with modern democratic free countries as `` racism '' . 
  i wo n't deny that some members are racist , but this applies to virtually any group of people on the planet . 
  i stated that their ideology is anti-racist , and you 've done nothing to disprove that , 
  for those who 're willing to invest 5 hours into what is , ultimately , only a comparatively brief introduction into the entire region and it 's politics at the time , i can very highly reccommend '' [ the death of yugoslavia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6mblimhjwi ) '' , an old bbc documentary which won numerous awards . 
  since it 's free and available at the youtube link above , i 'd encourage anyone interested in the subject to watch it . 
   religion doesnt make someone good or evil . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't actually agree with you , i do tend to subscribe to the idea that left alone good men will do good and evil men evil , but religion can make a good man do evil . 
  regardless , i also think that to attribute all acts committed by a person who subscribes to a religion to that religion is foolish . 
  clearly some acts are religiously motivated , and some terrible acts have been done in the name of religion - but i detest the way henious acts are chalked up and a score kept of acts committed by people and of what religion or irreligion they belong to as if all acts committed by anyone with faith can be attributed to the faith . 
  hitler was quite a superstitious man , but i do n't blame the genocide he oversaw on paganism . 
  i agree with the assessment but not the reasoning . 
  i would argue that the reason the serbs took so much more blame ( besides the fact that they intentionally sheltered war criminals for as long as possible after the war ) is that milosevic was intentionally stirring up that hatred before the war , and people were going along with him doing that . 
  the serbian leadership orchestrated ethnic violence which other ethnicities took to like ducks to water . 
  umm , you 're supporting my point , you realise ? 
   ethnocentrism is just bigotry repackaged in an easily digestible term . 
  i disagree . 
   are you really trying to justify that this is n't racism ? 
  i 'm not `` trying '' to justify , i 'm stating that it is n't . 
  it 's stupid to conflate objection to culture with objection to skin colour . 
   so it 's valid to discriminate based on religion from your point of view ? 
  yes , why on earth would n't it be ? 
  no that 's fine , i was n't irritated or anything , just clarifying , 
  no , sorry , i * am * against religion , and especially islam which is a fucking terrible excuse for killing trees . 
  i 'm fine with muslim moderates precisely because they ignore the nasty parts of islam because they do n't really believe nearly as much as fundies . 
  but it 's the religion i oppose . 
  in response to your response you just deleted : quote from edl leadership on wikipedia , from a book on the subject :  the edl is a `` multi-ethnic , multi-religious movement and we are proud of that '' . 
  you continued :  something is known by the public you think it 's known because you assume and believe , and because it 's easy to write off those who protest against islam as racists because most muslims are brown . 
  it 's indicative of the sort of small minded actual racism practised by the `` anti-racism '' groups that they take criticism of islam for criticism of brown people , as if only brown people can be muslim . 
   however being islamophobic is indeed cultural racism what a retarded term . 
  firstly , ethnocentrism covers the concept perfectly well , and secondly , to call ethnocentrism racism is ridiculous . 
  racism is discrimination based upon colour or `` race '' , to discriminate based upon something people choose to partake in is perfectly valid , and you do it all the time . 
  as does everyone . 
   use of the word racism usually includes hatred against religions nowadays . 
  among complete fucking morons , i agree . 
  please provide your evidence for disagreeing , and also please do explain what you mean by their `` unpleasant '' history . 
  this is very complicated . 
  the simple answer is yes , but the complicated part is - were muslims targeted because they were bosniaks , or were bosniaks targeted because they were muslims ? 
  they 'd lived as ethnically and to an extent culturally different peoples for so long that at least as an outsider who 's studied this ( bloody complex ) war quite a bit , it 's hard to dissociate one part from the other . 
  largely i 'd say that you could n't call this a religious conflict in the way that the crusades were . 
  the wars were n't by people seeking really to spread religion or even get rid of other religions , imo - they were done to get rid of people , to move people out of land , and to claim more land for specific ethnicities ( predominantly serbs ) . 
  i 'd say the balkan wars of the 90 's were mostly political and ethnic , but i suppose to count ethnicity which came to be defined * because * of religion and not count in the religion would be a bit short sighted . 
  tl ; dr - it 's complicated . 
  ignoring the fact that your own source admits that mao `` may '' have been an atheist , you might want to consider the fact that it does n't actually impact upon my point in the slightest . 
  the point being , that there are plenty of bad people of every religious or irreligious persuasion , but that just because someone holds beliefs about religion does n't necessitate that every act they carry out is done because of those beliefs or for those beliefs . 
  also , fwiw , wikipedia holds stalin as a militant atheist and mao as having no religion . 
  as an atheist i do n't give a fuck that they were atheists , because that does n't necessitate that their crimes were atheist crimes . 
  tbh much of the modern `` anti-racism '' movement within europe just tars all who oppose islam as racist nazis . 
  it 's an easy slur to throw around , and i think the iq within the groups is roughly as low as it is within many of the anti-racist groups like edl etc. 
  - which is to say fucking low . 
   why are you against islam ? 
  no culture is superior to another , we 're all equal and every culture should be respected , that 's a joke , right ? 
  you 're telling me that cultures which practise female genital mutilation , look up to those who can afford a young boy to rape on a regular basis , stone women to death if * they 're * raped , and think that any woman who does n't wear a giant black sheet is a whore - is equal to all others ? 
  seriously , you 're going to make that claim ? 
  on the working conclusion that the above is sarcam , do n't bother answering . 
  do n't know about the other groups , but edl ( the organising group ) ideology is explicitly anti-racist , and they 've had internal battles when kicking out subgroups found to be racist . 
   this counter-jihad group is also anti-homosexual and want woman to stay at home ( well anti-feminist ) . 
  i think we all can agree that we , as a majority , should show them that we do not accept their ignorance and racism .
