  it 's not fucking racism to oppose islam . 
  from a practical sense though , it * is * a few years now since we had our last crusade , and in europe increasingly a good deal of us are n't even christian anymore , europe is entering a post-religious stage in its existence . 
  the exception being islam . 
  muslims are , by and large , rather fundamentalist about things , and so there is good reason to discriminate ( as in , to distinguish between ) a dying religion which is paid lip service , and a thriving religion which is followed by many to the letter . 
  and stalin and mao were both atheists . 
  not all crimes committed by people of a religious stance are religious crimes . 
  feminism is n't about men though , it 's about women . 
  this is why i call myself an egalitarian , not a feminist and an mra . 
  yeah , there 's a definite split between the latin and germanic countries , i just happen to prefer the latin way of doing things despite being a brit . 
  i think it 's just all about your daily cycle . 
  some people wake at 6 , eat at 6.30 , and so i understand that if they only eat a light lunch they need food in the late afternoon . 
  me , unless i 'm constrained by day to day life , i like to eat breakfast around 11am , and so tend to eat lunch around 3-4pm ( if i eat it ) and then dinner comes around 8-10pm . 
  i grew up eating dinner between 8-9 pm . 
  these days i 'll sometimes eat between 9 and 10pm . 
  1830 is crazy early for dinner to me . 
   i suppose ethnocentrism kinda gets put under the umbrella of racism because by judging another culture by your culture 's standards , the implicit judgement is that your culture is better than the other and brings up the ghosts of imperialism . 
  it 's kind of absurd to call that racism though . 
  i judge plenty of other cultures as inferior to my own for practises which are culturally acceptable in them ( female circumcision , the pashtun practise of bacha baz , i could go on ) . 
  that said , i think it 's the height of stupidity to assume that because someone is black or white you know things about them . 
  to judge a person by their culture seems quite obviously a functional thing to do , while to judge someone by the colour of their skin is stupid . 
  oh sorry , i was n't sure about the meaning so googled it and the definition i found was rubbish . 
  looked up a better one , and yes , it clearly is . 
  ( not sure why you got downvoted for that but it was n't me ) . 
  not sure why on earth ethnocentrism would be counted as racism . 
  i 'm ethnocentric and tbh i 'm perfectly happy with that , but i 'm not racist . 
  not talking about ethnocentrism , talking about discriminating between cultures , which is racist so long as one is an idiot , but not otherwise . 
   because it is a threat to the freedom of speech itself . 
  if enough people believe in it , eventually this freedom will be annulled . 
  again , * says you * . 
  this is the whole point . 
  once you start allowing any person or group of people to prohibit freedom of speech , you no longer have it . 
   let us assume that free speech is one universal right that should never be abolished . 
  that is a very big assumption , but i will say that i support freedom of speech a fundamental human right . 
   but , letting someone to talk about annulation of freedom of speech - letting `` propaganda '' exist - is potentially like prohibiting free speech itself . 
  prohibiting free speech is the only thing that is like prohibiting freedom of speech . 
  talking about it is ** not ** the same thing , and should never be treated as such . 
  one involves force , the other does not . 
   so , free speech might lead its to self-destruction . 
  if you want to have rights , you have to accept that things can go wrong . 
   so why would anyone be allowed to put at risk the one universal right ? 
  they 're allowed to * talk * about doing anything , because talking and expressing has does n't actually do anything , it 's transfer of thought or ideas , nothing more . 
  if you want to start saying certain ideas are fundamentally dangerous then well done , you 're into thought-crime land . 
   if you want it to exist forever , you have to prohibit anti-free speech propaganda . 
  no , you do n't , you just need to be prepared to fight when ever anyone tries to take it away from you . 
  we do n't stop fights by cutting off every babies arms at birth , we prevent them by fighting back when they happen . 
  why do you believe it doesnt ' apply to opposition to freedom of speech ? 
   from your urge to defend free speech , you are defending those who are anti free-speech . 
  i 'm defending their ** right ** to express themselves how they want , even if that takes the form of opposition to freedom of expression as it does in your case . 
  i defend your right to say the things you say , even though i profoundly disagree with you . 
   you can keep your emotions at home , i 'm just arguing . 
  very badly . 
   you are right that banning symbols and expression of any idea is technically a violation of free speech - like banning racist speech - but in this case it 's not even about that , it 's the fact that you are destroying this fundamental right by applying it to commies . 
  `` it 's good for most people but not the people i do n't like so let 's make an exception for them '' you.just.don ` t.get.it . 
   please expand . 
  not much more to it . 
  we do n't have freedom of speech because there are people in this country who decide what we can and can not say and make laws about that . 
   why ? 
  because i support freedom of speech ? 
  that 's pretty simple . 
   i could also say i have the freedom of doing whatever i want right , freedom is the right to do whatever you want so long as it does n't impact upon another 's right to do the same . 
  that 's a fairly robust defintion i tend to stick by . 
  you kill me ? 
  you take away my right to do as i please . 
  you put a hammer and sickle on your car ? 
  no impact on me . 
  now i know it might not leave us in a perfect world , where slander and harassment are legal ( not necessarily socially permissable though !, 
  ) , but that 's the price of freedom and i would gladly accept it . 
  what 's your point ? 
  urgh , jesus , what are you george bush ? 
  by arguing for the ** right ** to do something i 'm not neccessarily supporting anything or everything done under that right . 
   free speech are you seriously going to argue for freedom of speech while arguing that symbols you do n't like should be banned ? 
   well , it 's worth reminding , that even freedom of speech and expression is actually a qualified right ( at least in the uk , ca n't speak for other countries as i do n't know ) , which government can interfere with , if it deems necessary . 
  they call it that , but really in the uk it 's just a right which is taken away , we do n't have freedom of speech here . 
   furthermore , in some situations such as bullying/harrasment/racism , in my opinion it is justifiable , do n't you think ? 
  no , never . 
  mao and his folk . 
  it being `` ok '' is not the same as it being legal . 
  since when did so many of us turn into people who think that everything which is undesirable to us personally should be illegal ?!? 
  we toss away the very freedoms these symbols stand against !, 
  you do n't want to ? 
  no problem you want to forbid it outright ? 
  problem . 
  people have the right to express themselves in any way they please , even when they express stupid or malign things . 
   and it is promoting something perhaps , you ca n't really say that without knowing motivations . 
   something that is harmful to the society and any innocent human when applied . 
  in your opinion . 
   an idea of crime and support for it . 
  i do n't see how prohibiting the promotion of crime is bad . 
  were they not banned , commies could wander around freely and gather supporters . 
  are you ok with that ? 
  jesus christ yes !, 
  do you hold ** any ** desire to live in a free democratic country or not ? 
   would you be ok with the kkk members wondering around in their clothes gathering racist people ? 
  again , yes . 
   can you tell my why the reasons are bad , apart from the fact that you feel it 's `` ridicoulous '' ? 
  because it requires society to prohibit what is essentially an utterly harmless form of expression which should be protected under any country 's freedom of expression laws . 
  seriously , banning symbols is what the guys you 're hating on did , not what mature free democratic nations do . 
  i still maintain it 's ridiculous to ban symbols . 
  hear hear !, 
  the ban everything which offends me crowd are on the rise though , unfortunately :( you things are getting retarded when american liberties are starting to seem more and more appealing over everything we 've got here .
