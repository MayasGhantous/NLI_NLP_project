   those symbols are offensive to every self-respecting human and they can do no good whatsoever . 
  oh come on , you tell him not to be a child and then you talk about being offended !?!, 
  i would desire to carry neither but banning stuff in case someone 's feelings get hurt by it is truly infantile .

  the [ view ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rclb8.jpg ) [ out ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pbf8l.jpg ) of my garden growing up . 
  ( crappy teenage sunset photos they may be , but we got the odd hill up here aye ? ), 
  i 'm not sure what you 're getting at there ... 
  `` no you ca n't say one thing is bad because another thing someone else did is bad ! '', 
  i ca n't help but just feel , serbia really did a lot of bad shit in that region , and to think you can do that bad shit and then not have stuff like the kosovo secession pulled on you and supported by the internationals is just kind of blissfully blind . 
  reap what you sow ... 
  no , they were n't , because they knew the missile shield could at most stop 1 or 2 missiles , not the few thousand they have ready to go . 
  russia * claimed * to be worried about this , but it was just an excuse to kick up a big fuss over the issue and flex some political muscle . 
  what their real goal was , as per usual with russia , is hard to decipher . 
   well , it is an attack on them . 
  that 's utterly ridiculous . 
  it 's not an attack on gunmen if i wear armour . 
  it 's not an attack on a robber if i double lock my front door or buy a gate . 
  reducing anyone 's ability to attack you does not constitute an attack upon anyone . 
  ( this all , by the way , ignores the fact that the missile shield does n't actually interfere with russia 's ability to end the world , should it choose . ), 
  obvious troll is obvious . 
  they 're not the friendliest nation to anyone . 
  let 's not forget that this is a nation who took the suggested setting up of a missile * defence * shield as an attack upon their nation . 
  russia as a state is insane and dangerous . 
  i find figures which suggest the disparity is roughly a factor of 8 , not 10 , but sure , why not . 
  i already said elsewhere that manufacturing ! = exports . 
  that said , what people care about is that we 're either making shit , or processing shit to make it better that other people are buying . 
  refining oil or producing drugs may not be counted into manufacturing , what it 's what most people mean by these things . 
  we have no heavy industry left basically though and this tends to be the core of all `` manufacturing '' - hence china now outdoing the us on that front . 
  ah right yes , fair enough . 
  umm , whut ? 
  you linked an identical image . 
  here 's the [ us version ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/united_states_export_treemap.png ) of what i posted further up . 
  while it does n't tell you what they manufacture , it does tell you what they export , which in a way is more interesting . 
  well , you 've got to do something with the 0.31 % of `` insulated '' - whatever that is ( my monies on us being the world 's no. 1 producer of fleshlights ) . 
  never been to certain parts of london i see ... 
  indeed . 
  i 'm suspecting that this category includes all vehicles of size lower than a car or motorbike , so snowmobiles , golf carts , mobility scooters . 
  6.7 % of exports is still surprisingly high ( it 's 33 billion dollars ) but there 'll be some little thing in that category which it would never strike you as being everywhere ( like mobility scooters , say ) which will massively push up the exports . 
  overall though there is no big export , our exports are massively diversified , which is great . 
   while i do agree we do n't make anything you can agree if you want but it 's not true . 
  we export half a trillion dollars worth of goods per year and are the 10th largest exporter in the world despite being a services orientated country .

  sorry mate , but it has n't . 
  still a very commonly used term here in the uk . 
  that 'd be east then . 
  umm , brit here , the french are quite protectionist yes , but then so is the us . 
  us on the other hand ... shit ... i do n't even know if we have any companies left anymore ... 
   europe may be a financial disaster and a faded military force typical for u.s. newspapers . 
  we 've got the * biggest economy in the world * and the second best funded military forces in the world ( as a combination ) and they talk as if we 're nearly dead . 
  i know the hyperbole goes both ways , but for the wp to publish stuff with an opening line as plainly wrong as this is disappointing . 
  would you care to make a mature point or shall we just go with sound bytes from here on out ? 
  i 've got a few if you 're into that ? 
  i would say the [ outlook ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=world:earth&amp;idim=country:ee&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) is fantastic . 
  estonia does seem to be doing pretty well . 
  if you think right wingers in / r/europe are prevalent you must : a ) be extremely left wing and b ) not go to many other subs that / r/communism and / r/pyongyang, 
  czech republic has very similar gun laws to the more gun-liberal parts of the us . 
  plenty of eu countries have similar gun laws to the us . 
  anti gun people do n't seem to get , gun crime in america is n't a problem of guns , it 's a problem of * americans * with guns . 
  there are plenty of guns here in europe and far fewer shootings and massacres ( although they happen , there was a mass shooting in the uk just 2 years ago ) . 
  i 'm not sure i understand your point . 
  that 's not strictly true , there are many union agreements and state regulations which result in an effective minimum wage in most of germany . 
   and yes , you sounded bigoted , saying only the superior populations should have modern economies with modern industries oh grow up a little . 
  i did n't say that any more than i said that africans should stick to subsistence farming - but i 'm not going to pretend like kenya can become the financial capital of the world just because everyone moves to a city . 
  i 'm not saying that only `` superior populations '' * should * have modern economies , i 'm saying that countries like greece * do n't * have the economy they 've acted like they do , and that they 've wanted to have . 
  they simply do n't , and pretending otherwise wo n't change anything . 
  greece has stopped producing as much , imports way more , and is n't particularly great at the services industries besides tourism and shipping management . 
  there 's an obvious problem there which needs to be solved by the sort of lower tech agricultural production which greeks can easily achieve at this point in time . 
   certainly do n't allow them to rent ( unless the market crashes brutally ) , and is definitely not enough for privatized health or education which will lead to bigger class differences and potential clashes . 
  let 's not be dramatic now , greek people were doing just fine in the 80 's and 90 's . 
  sure , they might not have had the luxury lives they had in the 2000 's , but we all saw where going down that route lead them . 
  greece will be just fine , but it 's going to have to accept that it 's got a mediocre economy and after acting like it was denmark or sweden for a decade or two it 's going to have to pay a lot of money out of its mediocre earnings to pay off that debt , which is going to make things tight , but that 's the situation they 're in . 
   maybe a crashing 800 $ a month is a fortune for a western country and people just need to get used to eating 2 meals at best a day . 
  again , just being ridiculous , i know plenty of people in the uk who live on that per month - ok so you ca n't go to cafes and you buy clothing once a year , but so the fuck what , life on minimum wage is tough - but you do n't automatically deserve luxury just because you happened to be born in europe . 
   it certainly were n't the fisherman who wanted to quit , i heard them year after year as they got shafted . 
  did you ? 
  that 's true to an extent , but the eu was doing precisely what needed to be done there . 
  if you think fishermen up in the uk were n't complaining as * they * got `` shafted '' then you 're mistaken . 
  everyone did in their minds , because overfishing was rampant and the common fisheries policy was a requirement to working toward sustainable fishing . 
  nevertheless , greece had a considerably more agrarian economy , and that worked for them . 
  they were n't rich , but they had a functioning economy - now they do n't . 
   we will turn into paradises following the model of latvia , with a third of the educated youth gone , 23 % gdp loss and no social services , all to pay for your high horse . 
  privatised social services is different than no social services . 
  as for the fate of latvia , look to estonia . 
  they suffered a similar collapse in terms of magnitude , but through strict austerity they have already recovered to 2007 levels of income , and are predicted to achieve 25 % growth of the economy by 2016 . 
  latvia 's recovery has been slower , but they 're likely to return to 2007 levels of income in mid-2013 . 
  brain drain is inevitable in the modern eu , but educated people follow the money and the growth , and the baltic countries are going to be somewhere to go in the near future . 
   do you even realize how bigoted you sound ? 
   it will eventually get taken from you anyway because the neo-liberal agenda is completely catastrophic and will spare no one . 
  yes , the sky is indeed falling in . 
   and that 's if revolutions and wars do n't start happening and the eu and the euro holds , which is more and more likely by the minute . 
  revolutions ? 
  d'you have any idea how ridiculous you sound ? 
   my main argument is that the crisis would have happened even if greek politicians played by the rules . 
  possibly , but if the politicians and the people had both played by the rules , the crisis would have been much much less deep . 
   but what does that prove about the average greek person ? 
  the greek `` black market '' - that is business which is carried out without being taxed , has been around 1/3rd of the total economic activity of greece . 
  this is insane , and i think to try and pretend that many average greeks were n't complicit in this is just to delude oneself . 
   why should i blame one and absolve the other ? 
  i do n't say absolve , but what i do say is that the issue is bigger than just borrowed money .
