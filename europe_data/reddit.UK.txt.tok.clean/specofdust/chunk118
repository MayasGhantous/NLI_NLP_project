  sources within the fbi described the eu as being approximately 4000 km tall and of a heavily built frame , and described the eu as probably unarmed , but advised that anyone who encounters the eu should definitely shoot to kill , before draping the body in a us flag *, 
  never quite sure in here , especially not with roma . 
  negative , british atheist who abhors israel checking in . 
  i just think the idea that stereotypes are a necessary outcome of group behavior is a retarded concept . 
  tell that to the jews , 
  they 're a spy agency , of course there 's other stuff which was shredded and kept quiet . 
  i would be deeply unsurprised . 
  right but the point i 'm making is that those do n't appear to function particularly well , from what i 've read , and even if i did i do n't really see the point in making individuals carry them . 
  so essentially if you cross the line then you should n't drive , fair enough . 
  i still do n't think it 's going to be an effective scheme though , people wo n't use them properly , people wo n't use them at all , and people will ignore the results . 
  i just do n't see this being anything other than an # 11 tax for motorists who get caught . 
  of course not , i just dislike the idea of having an # 11 tourist tax . 
  quite so - what i 've read suggests that the colour change between road legal and road illegal is much more fine than that though , as chemical breathalysers are n't particularly great ( hence why police use fancy expensive ones ) . 
  further to that , having one in the car seems unlikely to stop anyone who 's drunk enough to get behind the wheel getting behind the wheel . 
  link to example ? 
  and how is someone going to judge whether they 're slightly over the limit or slightly under it ? 
  the colour differences are minor , and the idea that people who we know have had alcohol should be trusted to judge is absurd . 
  i 'm talking about crystal based breathalysers , what are you talking about ? 
  tough question . 
  allowing for a very low bac would cover those who 're boozed up from the night before etc. 
  - still , it 's preferable to people using crappy breathalysers . 
  this is kind of stupid and just inconvenient . 
  the cheap ones are useless , and no-one will buy the expensive ones . 
  it would be much wiser just to make any consumption of alcohol illegal before driving . 
  i completely agree . 
  right now i feel like our nation states are the like the most serene republic of venice - powerful for what we are but weak compared to our ottoman , austrian , french , and spanish neighbours by virtue of their large size and our small . 
  would not the people of venice have said of italian unification that the genoese were markedly different in culture and tongue , and that one would inevitably subsidise the other upon their unification ? 
  the advert is terrible , but i 'm equally irritated by the fact that the eu is making adverts pushed at any single race/creed/religion or gender . 
  sience is ** not ** a girl thing , science is a human thing . 
  this is fantastic news and is exactly the sort of thing we need the eu for . 
  no other entity has the clout to apply such fines , and since most individual countries would give much much lower fines microsoft could safely ignore them . 
  it 's only by taking a serious percentage of their profits that any legal entity or organisation will ever get these massive corporations to alter their behaviour . 
   only elected candidates can be appointed as a minister as a mechanism to avoid fraud , or as a mechanism to avoid leaders picking their teams ? 
  personally i do agree with the us system of having unelected ministers picked by an elected president - it seems strange to me that for technocratic positions a leader should be forced to pick from the sum total of people who 're electable and lucky , rather than absolutely everyone . 
  i was saying that you have a point , that it is indeed romance language and not a `` romantic '' language . 
  i was also agreeing that the finnish language is fascinating , because the finno-urgic languages are . 
  point ^, 
  born in england , raised in scotland . 
  i 'm scottish , i 'm british . 
  some may consider me english too . 
  i grew up with a sort of nested set of nationalities vested in me . 
  for this reason , i find it very easy to identify as a european , and i feel that applies as logically as calling myself a brit . 
   why on earth are both of you being downvoted ? 
  people do n't like the factual statement 's they making . 
  this is reddit . 
  if people do n't like facts , they down vote them . 
  what is the problem ? 
  hmm ? 
  edit : complaining without stating why . 
  strange . 
  let 's try communism again !, 
  our species probably have enough people to survive another 3 or 4 tries !, 
  more specifically , it 's brythonic . 
  shenpen , if you have serbians by your side there 's a good chance you 're already * in * a war . 
  not 100 % . 
  just because it 's the torygraph does n't mean they ca n't take the piss from time to time . 
  thar be slavic . 
   legenda awesome . 
  i love how we live in a place where we all know just enough of the various languages so that if someone throws out a word which could be in multiple languages but clearly has its root in latin , we can all understand . 
  that 'd be `` legend '' in english , fyi . 
  china is nowhere near cool , but in this case it seems like incompetence as opposed to malevolence or a lack of morals . 
  totaly down to the cashier , the general problem is that cashier 's tend not to be too knowledgeable about the law and about what is and is n't legally equal to british id - and if they refuse a sale a manager will almost always back them up just because most shops prefer the manager to back up bad decisions against selling alcohol just to always be playing it safe . 
  it sucks , it really really sucks and i 'm horrified that there is n't more outrage about it . 
  lem me guess , morrisons or sainsbury 's ? 
  those supermarkets both have horrendous policies about id . 
  officially all they accept is a uk drivers license or a uk passport . 
  i 've seen a german girl get turned away despite having an id card ** and ** a german passport when trying to buy a bottle of wine with a week 's worth of shopping . 
  it 's absolutely absurd , racist , and terrible . 
  i wish my government would bitch slap them for these policies , because they should be fined # 10,000 per time they turn down valid id just because it 's from a different eu nation . 
  finns taking something from swedes ? 
  that makes a nice change xd . 
  and it 's still the best feta i can afford . 
  my supermarket ( uk ) has feta from greece , and i 'm sure it tastes godly , but at # 3 per block , it 's about # 1.20 more than the patros level stuff , and # 2 more than generic supermarket feta ( which is tasteless ) . 
  downvotes ? 
  seriously r/europe ? 
  jesus christ guys , the guy answered the question about what he takes for granted in his country . 
  just because most of you do n't * like * gun ownership does n't mean you need to downvote him . 
  you disappoint me r/europe . 
  i think this is basically available anywhere if you desire to pay twice as much as everyone else for your food . 
  ... for now . 
  i have not . 
  i have been to the united states ( 8 of them ) and experienced a good queueing etiquette , i would be surprised if it 's ingrained to the same extent anywhere but blighty though . 
  edit : not sure why someone downvoted you there . 
  seems quite rude . 
  queueing . 
  in the uk there are strict rules about queuing , everyone who is n't fresh off the boat knows them , and they are followed rigorously . 
  the uk has such a strong queuing ethos that we even have things like `` the invisible queue '' , the queue where there is no physical queue , but everyone keeps an eye on whose turn is next and who came after them . 
  i can safely say that with queuing it is n't just `` might not be so '' but rather , that no other country i 've been to lives up to my expectations for queuing . 
  here 's a map of northern europe from [ 1601 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/septentrionales.jpg ) . 
  here 's a ( bad ) map of northern europe from [ 1482 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/cosmographia_northern_europe_1482.jpg ) here 's a satellite photo of northern europe from [ 2010 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/satellite_image_of_northern_europe.png ) . 
  here 's a [ map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/europe_subregion_map_un_geoschme.svg ) with the un divisions of europe . 
  so ... face it , you are very wrong . 
  bah , first it describes the uk as being west european ( we 're north ) then it describes england as `` britain '' . 
  for an article about maps the author is n't too clued up on basic geography . 
  in 50 years time they 'll find themselves having gone from madame durand and monsieur roux to misses davies and old man roberts , a nice middle class couple with a couple of kids in a nice expensive public school and a daughter who goes horse riding twice a week . 
  britain - you 're either us , or yet to be us . 
  of course , i 'm happy to try in more moderate cases . 
  there are , i 'm realising though , plenty of people out there who do not live in a rational world . 
  i can not generally argue them out of their irrational positions with rational argument , because in general the confirmation bias is so strong that anything i say is either immediately written off as propaganda or misinformation , or is twisted and incorporated . 
   besides , it 's not like it would serve us much good to hate them back , it would be much better if they at least allowed us to try and change their minds ( and that 's much easier to do if you do n't just assume they 're idiots ) .
