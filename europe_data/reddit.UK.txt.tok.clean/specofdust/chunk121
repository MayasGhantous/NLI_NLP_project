  my memory of driving in canada was that it was a miles country . 
  ** k ** ilometers ** p ** er ** h ** our  while km/h would have been scientifically correct a few years back , if you want to be properly scientific these days you 'd need to say km h ^ -1 , so frankly neither us nor you lot are obeying the scientific rules properly . 
  i agree the british tendency to say kph is a bit weird , but it just rolls of the tongue more easily than km/h . 
  edit : how the hell does that goes downvotes ? 
  i answer the question and give some background and you guys downvote me ? 
  people downvote for the strangest things ... 
  i go to finland quite a bit , unfortunately because their language is n't either romantic or germanic in it 's origins , i 've got virtually nothing on 'em . 
  it 's just my experience that when i travel in parts of the eu everyone just speaks english when i 'm around ( english speaker ) . 
  native languages aside from english are often `` secret talk '' or used to purposely not include the english speakers . 
  capability to speak english is so high in so many places that while on a day to day basis sure , they speak their own language , when foreigners are about ( from anywhere ) english becomes the default lingua and native language becomes secret family language . 
  as an english speaker you 'll already have that experience in many places . 
  the germans are very pally with the russians . 
  ca n't offend dear old putin . 
  the iss . 
  i do n't like apples . 
  they clearly are comparable , as many have compared the two in this thread , with differing opinions as the outcomes . 
  turks propagating the story of a genocide ? 
  never thought that 'd happen ... 
   communism is a socioeconomic model for the redistribution of wealth . 
  it has been co-opted by dictators , but there 's nothing it that requires a dictatorship . 
  not in the written theory , but the practise makes it virtually inevitable . 
   in fact , there 's nothing in it that requires any abrogation of your rights at all , except the unfettered ability to own property ( some would say the right to exploit other ) . 
  that 's a pretty big right , there . 
   unfortunately , in its incarnations up until now things have gone quite wrong . 
  i do n't think we can blame its incarnations any more . 
  communism fails because it virtually entails dictators . 
  it 's happened almost every , single , time . 
  the horrors that have followed are greater , if not outright worse , than those ever seen on earth before . 
  to say that they are different in theory and therefore should not be equivocated is fine , if we 're talking in theory . 
  but i 'm talking in practise , and in practise communism has turned out to be bloody horrific in the 20th century , and there are no grand examples , with a few almost acceptable ones being the best straws one can grasp at . 
  ultimately , both ideologies have lead to the death of millions in the 20th century , and for this reason i think it a massive double standard or ignorance that we are so offended by the flag of one , but not of the other . 
  i do n't care if communists in west europe never got the power they required to do horrible things ( and i know they lacked the intentions to ) , they followed an ideology that has always lead that way , and for that reason , it seems just as abhorrent as the far rightists to me . 
  fair enough , 
  well i do n't agree , i mean i think both extremes are bad . 
  i just think that to object so vocally and to act like it 's such a horrible thing when the neo-nazi 's get in , but not bat an eyelid at a party with a hammer and sickle on their insignia entering parliament , is really just myopic and historically ignorant . 
  that 's a bit like saying neo-nazism is ok so long as you 're not neo-hitlerist . 
  i 'm sure one could find extreme right regiemes which have done ok in terms of running their countries , but by and large both sides of extremists have committed horrible atrocities when in government , and it strikes me as a horrible double standard that people shout and scream if the rightists get in , but do n't blink an eyelid at communists gaining a great amount of power . 
  i say this as a centrist by the way , not an extremist of one side or the other . 
  well , we hate nazi 's because of nazi germany , and the comparable system to that on the extreme other side is the ussr . 
  the crimes of the ussr were horrific also , yet the hammer and sickle does n't seem to get the same hatred as the swastika . 
  i do n't understand why . 
  just a quick thought . 
  there 's been a lot of outrage at the fact that neo-nazi 's have entered the greek parliament . 
  why is there not similar outrage that a professed communist party have entered the parliament ? 
  this is incorrect . 
  the uk national debt as of q3 2011 is 85.2 % . 
  i do n't think your analogy is apt , as it misses the scale of what you 're suggesting . 
  you 're talking about germany and other northern countries purposefully doing something that would have resulted in their economies going downhill into recession , as opposed to just being a little depressed , purely to help out a country which has utterly screwed itself . 
  it 's just not going to happen . 
  you 're not going to convince germans or dutch people to accept a declining standard of living in order to make life easier for the greeks who 've essentially been profligate and avoiding taxes for decades . 
  i ca n't see any fair argument for why they should , either . 
   because the harm on the other countries would have been much , much smaller than what greece has suffered . 
  maybe so , but why would they take this harm upon themselves to pay for the mess of the greek people ? 
   also , maybe overall even the strong economies would have benefited from having more economic growth in the eu . 
  recessions in greece , italy and spain are not good for the german economy . 
  i beg to differ . 
  this recession has proved rather good for the german economy . 
  hardly . 
   instead , the eu could have devalued the euro , which would have allowed greece to solve the budget deficit problem without salary cuts or tax hikes . 
  possibly could have , but then that would harm other countries . 
  why should other countries suffer for greece 's poor management of their own finances for the past decade or two ? 
   the last bit `` so you wouldnt starve '' implies that this money was given directly to help the greek people . 
  no , that is saying that your government would n't have had the money to pay for the day to day runnings of a state without the eu bailout . 
  your country would have collapsed without it . 
  such as ? 
  seriously , do you actually think the eu or imf just doling out hundreds of billions to the greek population would solve anything ? 
  of course it gets passed to the government , it 's insane to suggest things should be otherwise . 
  your government did n't fail to bring austerity to greece , it has been coming , it has been developing . 
  the greek people have opposed it at most opportunities , but it 's been coming along regardless . 
  many people , many greeks argue that austerity has failed . 
  this is being argued because they do not like it . 
  austerity was never supposed to fix all the problems in 6 months . 
  that is impossible , it will take years . 
  nevertheless , greek austerity is a process of adjusting the greek people to living within their means , and it is one that will continue one way or another . 
  you 're saying your government squandered hundreds of billions of euro 's , and you 're pissed at the eu ? 
  interesting . 
  do you also get annoyed at farmers if a restaurant prepares your food poorly ? 
  yeah man , so sorry . 
  it was truly terrible of us to loan you hundreds of billions of euros so you would n't starve . 
  really terrible . 
  what awful people we all are . 
  well , they work . 
  it 's an extreme country . 
  it seems like it 's going to either go far right again or far left . 
  revolution or military coup does n't seem so incredible anymore . 
   here in britain we just eliminated the bnp i 'm not sure why people say this . 
  sure , they were voted out in local elections because they 're a fringe party , but they were hardly ever a major force anyway . 
  their biggest achievement politically stands , they have 2.8 % of the british seats in the european parliament . 
   admitting that , are you seriously that ignorant of your historical government 's role in the famine ? 
  i understand their actions during the famine , aye . 
   and why do feel the need to react so defensively when you obviously share no responsibility for something that occurred over a century ago ? 
   so yeah , british guns and conquerors might have planted the seed for english to become the lingua franca , but hollywood and american pop culture is what helped it grow into what it is today . 
  do n't forget the socialist education systems in europe which have added an extra 250 millinon speakers to the world population . 
  i 'm from the uk . 
  i speak english . 
  i was never seriously taught any other language in school . 
  i have friends who speak 3-5 languages fluently , often they also speak some other languages to a very basic level . 
  oh but i 'm british , we 're responsible for just about every atrocity ever commited . 
  we had concentration camps before the germans dontcha know ? 
  i myself manned one back in my boer hunting days .
