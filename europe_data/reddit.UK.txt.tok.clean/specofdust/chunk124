   `` democracy '' for you . 
  for the rest of us , it 's direct democracy that really matters . 
  the `` rest of us '' ? 
  i would encourage you to be more careful in your claiming of support from all of the people who are n't me . 
  it 's so over-confident as to be obviously false . 
  direct democracy is in action in one country , switzerland . 
  the last notable thing it was enacted for there was to ban minarets so muslims could n't have any sort of obvious presence in their country . 
  this sort of tyranny of the majority action is precisely why so many political thinkers oppose direct democracy . 
   but i am impressed . 
  i thought neo-liberals were aware of only one political system . 
  brutal corporate dictatorship . 
  firstly , i 'm not neo-liberal . 
  while there are aspects of classical and neo liberal ideology which i support ( free trade and markets , globalisation , free enterprise ) , my economic politics reside slightly left of centre , and i think there are plenty of issues which should necessarily lie within the state 's purview ( healthcare , rail transport , police services , airports , postal services , electricity transport and delivery , and a host of other regulatory bodies ) . 
  secondly , can you please stop being so obnoxiously rude and condescending to me please ? 
  you act as if because i differ in my beliefs from you that that necessitates my ignorance of political or economic systems - for surely if i knew what you knew i would agree with you . 
  that sort of arrogance in one 's beliefs is , quite frankly , very teenage . 
   can you sell your liver ? 
  according your syllogism you do n't own your liver . 
  i can think of no deontologically moral reason that i should not be able to sell my liver - and i 'm not sure i follow you in your saying that i do not own my liver , but do feel free to explain further . 
   from enron to bp to banks to all kinds of corruption cases . 
  there have been numerous journal articles on the subject and a ton of comprehensive studies . 
  you seem to think this is an indictment of business - it is not , it is an indictment of human kind . 
  have a look at [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/world_map_index_of_perception_of_corruption_2010.svg/1000px-world_map_index_of_perception_of_corruption_2010.svg.png ) map of public sector corruption perception . 
  you 'll note that nearly the entire world 's public sector is perceived as being extremely corrupt by the people who it supposedly serves . 
  interesting also to note is that the vast majority of countries which are in blue or yellow on that map are very highly globalised free market or mixed economy countries . 
  corruption is a problem stemming from humans being human , not from corporations existing . 
  its presence in corporations like enron or bp or banks is inevitable - these were/are huge organisation with tens or hundreds of thousands of employees . 
  there are countries where one can not function on a day to day basis without paying bribes , and organisations like bp can go years without a single case of corruption - if anything that speaks to me quite remarkably of the culture behind corruption , as opposed to the corporate/public sector divide so normally picked upon . 
   btw , i was always wondered about people like you . 
  people like me ? 
  i am curious , what do you mean by that ? 
  people who hold different beliefs than you ? 
   have you actually worked in a corporate environment ( at a high enough position to see deals taking place ) or done any sort of business ? 
  nope . 
  i 'm currently a student once again . 
  i 'm curious what a different answer to this question would have meant to you . 
   i can understand you holding your views if you are rich . 
  which views are you specifically talking about here ? 
  i have a feeling you are making far too many assumptions about me . 
   but it recently occurred to me that there are people that favour free market policies even though they themselves do n't benefit directly ( and had little experience with any market ) as i said , i favour a mixture of free markets in certain areas with government control in others . 
  i 'm a strong proponent of universal healthcare and nationally owned power delivery companies , but i also favour free trade and open markets for one simple reason : they work . 
   in a very indirect manner , the same way that we have a `` democracy '' . 
  please familiarise yourself with political systems . 
  we have a representative democracy . 
  sneeringly putting the term `` democracy '' in brackets does not earn you respect , it makes you look oblivious . 
   plus , in my model , you ca n't sell it . 
  if you ca n't sell it , you do n't own it . 
  you and the rest of the neo-liberals are as religious as the pope . 
  another baseless assertion ( two , actually ) . 
  you make a claim and then fail to provide any evidence whatsoever - do not be surprised if people do not listen to you . 
  if you want to convince people , show them evidence . 
  otherwise you may as well not bother making the claim , or in your case , implication . 
   news items isolated cases of corruption exist everywhere . 
  in some places corruption is more common than others . 
  if you want to use the data to make a point go ahead , but do n't try to make a point without reference to any , because you are no-one to me , and i will not trust you at face value . 
   where do you get your history from ? 
  people starved in argentine during imf reign . 
  and obviously they will starve again if they fall in bed with imf or the bankers . 
  they 're already in bed with bankers , because they have banks . 
  lets face it , the crises of the 2000 region was caused by a variety of factors , and only one of them can really be pinned upon purely economics ( the peso being pegged to the usd ) . 
  the other reasons , the usual reasons an economy goes down the toilet , were due to bad government . 
  the downvotes say no , but the lack of response says '' ` cos it is !!!, 
  i do n't normally agree with you , but on this front , hell yes . 
  i 'd be all for eu sanctions on argentina . 
   this is way i am advocating for a model that makes every citizen a shareholder of resources , without a right to sell it ( like you ca n't sell your liver ) . 
  you 're advocating for something which already exists . 
  citizens ** are ** shareholders , they just were n't in direct control . 
  every citizen was a shareholder , but that does n't mean you ca n't have an executive board ( the government ) . 
  in this case , the government sold the oil rights to repsol and consequently each citizen benefited to the tune of approximately $ 400 . 
   it 's not so much that i like the state . 
  it 's that i think most private business are like 10000 times more corrupt . 
  ok well go ahead pulling numbers out of thin air if you like . 
  i 'm a scientist , and i require evidence before i believe things , not just hear-say taken on trust . 
   that 's a good thing , right ? 
  that depends on whether you think the argentine economy crashing again and people starving on the streets is a good thing or not . 
   it 's the same as water or air . 
  it 's unrelated to how much work you did . 
  except that oil just does n't magically come from a few miles underground to sitting in our fuel tanks , does it ? 
  ypf pay taxation , and repsol paid $ 15 billion for the ability to extract oil from those oilfields , not for a few oil rigs . 
  the state claims ownership of offshore natural resources , given that , the state has the power to exploit them , or to sell them to others . 
   true . 
  that was a mistake ( i think there were allegations that kirchner was bribed as well ) . 
  everyone does mistakes . 
  yes , people talk about allegations but no-one has ever produced any sort of proof in discussions i 've had . 
  frankly i just take this as a left-wing statist defence . 
   there you are . 
  she 's spot on . 
  if she pushes a bit more , and stops the falkland populist nonsense , i might even begin to like her . 
  argentina defaulted in 2001 . 
  if she keeps going like this , argentina will default again . 
  the only way she 's carried on this far is by looting an extra 5 % of her gdp or so every few years , but that can only go on for so long before she runs out of things to loot and , consequently , runs out of money . 
  by this point the economy is going to be doing naturally worse anyway , since argentina has just stuck a big red light at their front door as a sign to say `` do not invest in us '' . 
   ( it belongs to everyone ) why does it belong to everyone ? 
  what work did everyone do to get oil out of the ground ? 
   argentina can start claiming back what was theirs . 
  argentina ** sold ** what was theirs . 
  if they wanted it back they should have payed what it is worth , not just stolen it . 
  they 're using their power as a state to both keep the money from selling it , and keeping the item itself . 
   ( kirchner of course will never do the next step , she 's just a populist ) oh kirchner will keep looting anything of value in her country until there is nothing left to loot . 
  why is that treason ?
