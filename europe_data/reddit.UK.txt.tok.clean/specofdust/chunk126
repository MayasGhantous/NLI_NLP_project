  51 % of the population speaks english as either a first or additional language . 
  when i 'm in finland basically everyone speaks it , i 'm surprised if someone ca n't . 
  in germany , especially among young people , it seems to be pretty much universal to have high quality to perfect quality english . 
  edit : i suppose to add context , my girlfriend is finnish , my best friend is ukrainian , his girlfriend is estonian . 
  i live in a very european place in the uk ( aberdeen , believe it or not ) . 
  i travel a good bit between scotland and finland , and holiday throughout europe . 
  i guess i just feel there 's a strong linkage between the uk and other eu countries in a way which does n't exist between other countries to the same extent . 
  i stayed the night once . 
  it 's one of two places in the world i 've sworn never to go back to , the other being a town which was notable only for being an adjunct to a concentration camp in ww2 . 
  `` relatively ** unknown ** places to see in europe '' and you mention the no . 
  1 tourist destination on the planet ? 
  interesting ... 
  stay out of venlo ... never again ... never again ... 
  extra points for calling it `` brug-ge '' ( hard g ) not `` bruige '' ( bruise with a g ), 
   maybe i just need to travel more , but you 're all just foreigners to me . 
  and no offence to you , but i think you do  i travel about a bit in europe , and when you sit in whatever european city having a chat with random people you 've just met from 3-4 different countries over coffee , it 's easy to feel like part of one big european family . 
  to contrast this as another scot : all three equally . 
  because co2 emissions do n't just affect the eu , that 's why it applies to the entire trip . 
  other countries seem to be conveniently forgetting that we 're destroying the planet . 
  we really should consider , y' know , not ? 
  we ca n't . 
  them big and rich , us small and only slightly to moderately more rich than any single one . 
  there 's 3 of them and only 1 of us . 
  maybe we should get the germans on it . . they 've a good record of enforcing their rules xd, 
  let me guess , these poor little developing countries are going to use their using their absolutely massive economic power to block our attempts at ** saving the fucking planet ** , but we should n't expect more , because they 're poor little developing countries ? 
  seriously , humans deserve to wipe themselves out . 
  edit : apologies for the angry pessimism , it 's just we ca n't completely go this climate change work alone , and far from at least just doing what they could easily manage , other power blocs are actively blocking anything which might cost them a penny in the short term . 
  tragedy of commons , thou art writ large . 
  because the us , china , india , and hk will push against it and we ca n't beat them on a ftt , hell we probably ca n't even beat them down on imposing an carbon tax on flights in ** our ** airspace . 
  sounds familiar if you reverse the north south thing to me . 
  spoken too soon my good man , spoken too soon . 
  ms. brooks is having some laughy happy conversations in a police cell now . 
   til ... how can anyone be a refugee from europe ? 
  because we stick them in jail ? 
  now they 'll go to australia as refugees from canada . 
   copyright law by making available copyright material . 
  it was classed as `` making it available '' even if not done directly by the ruling in the rock & overton case which had decided that pointing to something was sufficient enough to class it as making available . 
  he lost the google argument because he vetted who went on the site and what links could be posted . 
  then we have two problems in this case . 
  broken copyright law and a broken extradition treaty to the us . 
  i swear this country becomes more utilitarian every day . 
  it 's a worry . 
  judges really do need to read some fucking ethics . 
  what law of ours has this chap broken ? 
  thank fuck for that . 
  i 'll eat gm crops if i like , thanks very much denmark . 
  the sooner we stop considering these guys our best buddies and start considering the us to be a partner when it suits * us * , the better . 
  they 've been taking advantage of us for 70 years now , and it should bloody well stop . 
  depends on whose measurements you trust . 
  gdp is a really flakey thing . 
  i 've heard measures that put the uk ahead in raw terms , ones that put the uk ahead in per cap but not raw terms , and ones that show what the above graph shows . 
  the important question is , who is harmed more by totalitarianism like this from the chinese government , us , or them ? 
  we do n't get money . 
  they do n't get the best product ( when that 's an eu one ) . 
  it basically does . 
  it 's marriage in all but name . 
  not any more we do n't , hence the 50 % youth unemployment rate and the empty towns . 
  we 're poor now after iceland lost our money and people stopped banking as much xd, 
  lets face it though , these are not real countries in anything but a technical sense . 
  they 're comparatively large estates with private laws as a byproduct of clever riding of politics by aristocratic families over the last few centuries . 
  the vatican , well that 's just obvious . 
  god needs his own country . 
  well if you want to take the geographical definition of europe we 've also got parts of kazakhstan and russia which are both effective dictatorships , so we 've got three of 'em . 
  personally i think the idea of `` europe '' is becoming more and more a political one . 
  when people talk of europe these days , rarely do they refer to countries like belarus . 
  the term has become short hand for eu + swiss + norway + iceland, 
  finnish drunks is where it 's at . 
  i 've had encounters with two , one pointed at a church and told me it was full of witches and lesbians ( was n't sure if that was criticism or endorsement ) , the other complemented the way i was dressed that day . 
  in britain they just mumble something about wanting 20p for the bus while standing outside the off license . 
  why are you guys downvoting this ? 
  the chap is spot on . 
  jesus / r/europe , you upvote a whole load of nonsense calling the us fascist ( right wing , sure , fascist ? 
  get out ) , and downvote a guy with a perfectly rational point . 
  it was . 
  there is no franc left that anyone 's going to give a shit about except for chf . 
  it 's a dictatorship , pure and simple . 
  but just as in ussr days , there 's nothing much we can do . 
  it might as well be behind an iron curtain , since the russians are so supportive of any despot so long as the despot will be * their * despot . 
  for any others who wondered : sen = special educational needs, 
  indeed he did . 
  my problem is , the number of people in favour of this should be proportional to the number of people who complain about the west lothian question , which is lots . 
  there is an obvious solution to the problem of england being governed by uk government but the rest of the uk not being , and that 's to either dissolve all the other national parliaments , or introduce regional parliaments across the uk . 
  agreed . 
  this kind of sucks hard . 
  not too difficult , but no-one seems to have thought about it . 
  13 states . 
  10 in england , scotland , wales , and ni . 
  done . 
  it would n't be required . 
  you could have a monarchist federation fairly easily . 
  personally i 'm all for a federal uk , and think it 's the only thing that 'll hold us together ( except , perhaps , national autonomy + stronger eu ) . 
  well , no sorry , you 're asking for the answer and i 'm giving it to you . 
  you 're saying greeks ca n't be made to pay tax , i 'm saying they can . 
  all tax collecting power is ultimately derived from the right to use force against the citizenry . 
  i 'm just saying that if the greek people wo n't give their tax without the use of that force , then it can indeed be used . 
  try it . 
  we 've upgraded our navy since the last time you lot invaded :d, 
  of course you 're correct , greece could be considered the kernel of europe . 
  yet , kiev could just as justifiably be considered the kernel of russia . 
  why are you downvoting this people !?!,
