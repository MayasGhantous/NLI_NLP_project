  do a job that pays more . 
  seems unfair to me . 
  gender informs on risk , why should n't insurance companies be allowed to take account of this ? 
  well , maybe that 's something to get campaigning about eh ? 
  the solution to the problem is obvious , increased devolution of the uk , or the abolition of devolution in the uk . 
  since the latter seems unlikely , it would appear that either the former is the solution , or a solution is not sought . 
  the solution to the west lothian question was devolution in england , and the english people who were asked turned it down . 
  you can hardly blame us for a problem when a solution was turned down . 
  so you 're english ? 
  why do you think alex salmond does have a say in your matters ? 
  further to that , why is it so horrific that a member of a uk parliament would have any influence whatsoever in regions they do n't preside over ? 
  why not ? 
  i mean , lets face it , compared with westminster politicians he 's actually pretty surprisingly good . 
  spot on . 
  it 's the only thing that 's going to save the damn euro at this stage , and it could be done . 
  germany is really cutting off it 's nose to spite its face here . 
  51 % speak english , and we 're all european . 
  certainly getting there . 
  edit : this is factually correct you stupid fuck . 
  edit 3 : so much stupid i stop counting now . 
  unfortunately , having previously colonised your little patch of land , scotland would be unlikely to join together in anything but a master/slave relationship :d . have fun with your southern neighbours though !, 
  edit : heh , always trust the colonies to get uppity when they 're reminded of their place !, 
  yeah ok , i was just seeking clarification that 's all . 
  i agree that it is , although i think it 's quite clear that an independent scotland would strive for higher levels of socialism than we currently enact , and hence overall tax rates would need to take the 10 % jump to go from just under 40 % to just under 50 % as per all of the nordic countries . 
  edit : also , stuff has gotten a fair bit more expensive in the last few years relative to income etc. 
  we 're still not at finnish levels , but it 's not like it was back in '06 where food was ridiculously cheap and most people were living the good life . 
  there 's always some kind of union , political or otherwise . 
  gradual unification seems inevitable so long as we continue to maintain multi million and billion person nation states, 
  hard to be sure . 
  just floating speculative thinking . 
  i think it 's becoming clear that smaller nations in europe essentially benefit by ganging together on many issues . 
  you mean scotland lacks industry , or that scotland lacks the desire for high levels of taxation ? 
  that said , if the eu does collapse in on itself , the idea of an independent scotland as part of some sort of northern union seems likely if scotland goes it alone . 
  the nordics are already integrated heavily with each other , no reason that could n't extend to scotland and ireland on a long enough time scale . 
  it 's ok buddy , i hear us jocks are to become part of norway or some such business . 
   a tax that does not burden 96 % of the economy , only the 4 % of the most excessive and useless gamblers ? 
  reading fail . 
  it will affect the entire united kingdom , but hardly affect any other eu countries . 
  that 's the point . 
  and those `` most excessive and useless gamblers '' are what makes the difference between the uk being a marginally wealthy eu country a la portugal or poland , and what we are , which is a very high income country . 
  the mose excessive and useless gamblers you so much malign earn us 10 % of our entire national income . 
   besides , was the tax even on the table ? 
  a financial transactions tax has been on the table for a while , i 'm fairly certain the french wanted that inserted into a financial treaty . 
  while i was in favour of uk participation in a new treaty and in general in more actively supporting the euro , the financial tax was a tax on london , proposed and supported because popular sentiment supports it , not because it makes sense or will raise meaningful amounts of money in euro saving terms , and because it has basically no effect on 96 % of the countries in the eu . 
  it was a stupid thing to even suggest , because the uk will not accept a tax like that being imposed on an eu basis , and the other eu countries ** must ** have known that by suggesting it the uk would walk away from the table , so i wish they would n't . 
   something has to act as a counterweight to the continuous power grab that we 're witnessing from europe . 
  right , so we shout `` no ! '', 
  every few months , and every time we do we 're seen and more and more stuck in the mud , people give up on us . 
  we build resentment , we lose political clout . 
  the uk does n't make suggestions other than vetoing ideas , that 's my whole damn problem . 
  we just poo poo anything other than the status quo . 
  there 's a difference between being constructive and being obstructive . 
  an eu interest can be in everyone 's national interest , like for instance now , if we do n't get the eu wide economy back on track we 're all in a lot of trouble . 
  in this case , the national aims of a country may present themselves as being being different than what 's best for the eu as a whole , yet if the eu as a whole does badly , in the long term the advantage found by chasing national benefit may be lost . 
  or to put it simply , what 's the point in making sure no-one 's stealing from your cabin , if the whole ship 's sinking . 
  we do n't advocate though , we respond . 
  we 've never even tried to take a leading role , or even an active role within the eu . 
  it 's just something which exists to us , and sometimes it tries to change and we object , and that 's about all there is to it . 
  you do n't have to sign up to everything to take an active role , you can just do more than constantly look out for yourself , which is all britain does in the eu . 
  it makes sure that nothing being passed is detrimental to it , and if it is , it complains . 
  we do n't do anything besides that - we contribute no intellectual or cultural qualities . 
   i 'm saying there is nothing that we , in britain can do to prevent the eurozone collapsing . 
  i disagree . 
  this should be a partnership of nations . 
  britain seems to take the view that it should let what other countries do happen , unless it is n't great for us , in which case we complain . 
  the french are putting pressure upon germany to do the one thing that will solve this crisis , printing money , we could be doing the same . 
  instead we 're solely focussed on looking out for number 1 . 
  we should be allied with the french right now , and yet the french and germans are both opposed to us . 
  we 're handling this in an utterly awful manner . 
   the germans signed up for the euro on the understanding that there would be no money printing yes , but there has to be . 
  everyone knows it , it 's just the german people wo n't accept it because they 're as economically clueless as every plebian population , and merkel is far too pathetic a leader to just push ahead and do it anyway . 
  that 's where we , as the third biggest economy in the eu , come in . 
  look at the effect france have , and their gdp is not so massively different than ours . 
  britain could form the crucial counterbalance to the usual german populism . 
  but instead we 're stuck with this island nation mentality of not getting involved unless it benefits us , and not inputting unless there 's something which might be a negative . 
  put simply , we add nothing . 
  we 're not constructive - we 're the negative nancy of the eu . 
   none . 
  what difference can we make to it now ? 
  none . 
  that 's so utterly defeatist . 
  we are completely and utterly fucked if the euro goes down . 
  i mean , we 're already hitting 1930 's style recession , if the euro goes down we 're talking multiples of that . 
  life as we know it would be over . 
  britain has economic power . 
  our political power is massively reduced by a virtual policy of non-participation , but our economic power remains and we can use that to aid the french in their push for realistic and beneficial reform of the eurozone and the eu in order to save the euro and gradually improve the eu economy . 
  whether we like the eu or not is at this stage irrelevant . 
  our fate is tied to it whether we go fully federal or withdraw even more . 
  what 's important for now is that we ** try ** to use what weight we have to improve matters , to prevent the eurozone collapsing ( we ** can ** do something about this ! ), 
  - not because it benefits some grand anti-sovereign eu bureaucrat goal , but rather because if we do not , we 're going to see a decline in quality of life to a standard not experienced for several generations . 
  so to sum up , your opinion is that we 're all fucked anyway and there 's nothing we can do about it so why bother trying ? 
   piss right off . 
  to say that the uk has not participated or done anything in the eu is , to put it bluntly , fucking lunatic . 
  you seem to have confused ` doing things ' with ` following germany / france ' . 
  check out rates of participation in general eu organisations . 
  the brits are a dying breed . 
  also seriously , when do we ever do anything in the eu that is n't objecting to something someone else proposes ? 
  all we do is drag our heels . 
   so we 're not allowed to point out when something is a bad idea ? 
  wow , talk about a union of yes men !,
