  you ca n't just desire it to be a certain way , you must make it that way . 
  sometimes that means creating value . 
   you are not aware of level of corruption there , yes it is the same as in africa . 
  africa is not one country , some areas are far worse than others . 
  greek corruption is bad , very bad . 
  so is italy 's , so is romania and bulgaria and all the other old soviet countries . 
  this does n't mean all of these countries should completely stop reforming or changing or creating policy until it 's fixed . 
  fixing corruption takes a very long time and is extremely hard ( which is why the vast majority of the planet is extremely corrupt , with only a handful of countries enjoying low corruption levels . 
   economics is about incentives not about insulting others who do n't behave on ways you think is right . 
  they can behave any way they want to , but if they refuse to do business just because they 're going to be taxed then they 're idiots . 
  taxation is inevitable , you have to pay it . 
  if 10 % of your tax money is being skimmed off the top by corrupt officials , that 's a reason to combat corruption , not a reason to stop paying taxes . 
   and you assume that they have huge piles of money hidden in their homes ( accumulated over years of not paying taxes ) and that now they are being able to pay those higher taxes . 
  no , i do not , i 'm quite aware that greece has n't been saving money up . 
  however they are now going to have to deal with the taxation levels they have ( still below the eu average , i might point out ) , because they 're completely broke . 
   almost their whole system is based on a huge public sector and austerity measures will cause huge poverty and more unemployment . 
  probably , yes . 
  but at this point the choice is not between no poverty and full employment against poverty and unemployment . 
  it 's between one option which results in less poverty and higher employment , and another option which in the long term will result in far more poverty and far higher unemployment . 
  the above article has flaws . 
  for instance it compares us growth to scandinavian , ignoring quite a lot of factors , and also ignoring that the simple reason the scandinavians can afford to have the welfare states they do is because they have extremely high levels of taxation ( which they actually pay ) . 
  greece can not afford to provide the level of public services it has been providing for a long time now , without ** massively ** increasing taxation . 
   how are they going to make as much money possible and pay debt off without reducing corruption ? 
  i agree , the corrupt culture needs to change , but corruption levels are n't going to change in the short term . 
  the idea that a country like greece should stay as it is and not reform until it 's gotten anywhere noticably less corrupt as a country is ludicrous . 
  elimination of corruption is a very long term task , and the greek economic problems are going to get far far worse if they just ignore them and refuse to reform for the next 25 years . 
   they would rather close down their businesses than pay taxes . 
  then they are idiots . 
   tax reduction or stimulation are actually part of every economic reform . 
  that would only be when taxes are high in the first place , which they were not ( and in fact , still are n't particularly ) . 
  the greeks started out a few years ago with a low levels of taxation , high levels of tax evasion , high levels of public spending , low levels of public revenue . 
  they 're not getting out of that mess unless they actually start collecting significant revenue . 
   especially because government is corrupt and taxes might not even end up in paying off debt but in politicians pockets . 
  to the extent you 're suggesting , no . 
  it 's greece , not equatorial guinea . 
   corrupt government even if it pays debt and forces people to pay taxes is no good . 
  that 's ridiculous , corruption always exists . 
  you can reduce it , but it 's never going to 100 % stop . 
  if you think that shouting about corruption reform ( something which is long term , requires reformation of social norms and beliefs , and a serious long term change in political systems ) is better for greece right now than making as much money as possible , paying taxes , and and paying debt off , then i think you must lack you are focussing excessively on politics , and not nearly enough on economics . 
  yes but with regards to large scale tax evasion that 's irrelevant . 
  i 'm not saying that the greek governments of the last 30 or so years have been good , they 've been fairly terrible it seems . 
  that does n't detract from the fact that large scale tax evasion has been the norm across greece and that 's one reason why it 's in such a sorry state now . 
  well , neither did the majority of greeks apparently - look where that ended up  whether you like your current government or not , it 's generally a good idea that people pay taxes . 
  the solution to corrupt government is not to stop paying taxes , the solution is new government . 
  not paying taxes and corrupt government ended up where greece is right now , which is a pretty shitty place . 
   ordinary greeks were not even aware how much indebted they are . 
  i 'm sure the 60 % or so of the greek population who do n't pay taxes could add 2 and 2 together and figure out that if they receive lots of services , and pay no taxes , that the country probably is n't doing too good . 
  yes , and now we 're suing the entire country in international courts , have seized their uk based assets , and they 're not getting into the eu any time soon . 
  iceland saying `` no '' to the loan repayments deal does n't actually mean they wo n't pay , they will probably pay the money eventually , but they will pay much more in the mean time by being international pariahs on the financial stage . 
   but that is not exactly democratic representative democracy ! = direct democracy . 
  people are stupid and selfish , they will vote for lower taxes for themselves and higher taxes for everyone else . 
  you would quickly end up with the state equivalent of a tragedy of commons if you actually let people have referendums on specific fiscal policies . 
  no they did n't deserve one , because the outcome would be inevitable . 
  you do n't tell a 5 year old they can borrow $ 1000 and then ask them if they want to pay it back . 
  of course they do n't want to , but that 's not how the world works . 
  an italian living in france . 
  we truly would all be screwed if he gained any power . 
  turned on the tv one morning while on holiday in france , shampoo advert on whatever random channel i 'd turned on ... nothing interesting until bam !, 
  uncovered , glorious breasts on the chick who was just casually shampooing away , on tv at 10am . 
  ** that 's ** why ( some ) european advertising is so much better . 
   i think the eu needs to be more open . 
  curious , what does this mean ? 
  i hear it a lot , and while i 'm not alleging ignorance on your individual part , many of the people who complain about the eu not being open enough do n't strike me as having even a basic knowledge of the eu institutions which run the union . 
  i 'm all for serious reform of the eu where problems exist , but i think an awful lot of people who basically know nothing about the eu make complaints that it 's bureaucratic/undemocratic/not open enough without actually having a clue . 
  once again , i 'm not asserting this is you , but i am deeply curious what you mean by `` more open '' . 
  guardian/icm poll published on the 24th shows 49 % want to leave , 40 % want to remain . 
  70 % of the british public want a vote on it . 
  truly democracy is a scary mistress . 
  i consider myself to be british first and foremost , and i will answer a very strong `` no '' to this . 
  i do n't have a great deal of faith in westminster government , in fact i do n't have much faith in any government , which is why i 'm actually a supporter of spreading the burden of government between multiple layers and regions . 
  for this reason , i support the notion ( nae , dream ) of a european federation . 
  the question of whether the uk will get involved properly , or leave entirely , is one that i do n't feel anyone can answer at this stage . 
  however i think one thing is fairly likely and certain , and that is that scotland ( my country of origin ) will leave the uk and rejoin the eu if the uk splits from the eu . 
  ultimately , us scots seem to quite like the eu , and honestly i think given the political situation which exists at the moment , if the uk were to pull out of the eu any time soon , then scotland would very quickly have a referendum on independence and rejoin the eu as a sovereign nation with the stated goal of desired federalism . 
   sorry but this is horrible logic . 
  if you abstain from voting for protesting reasons then obviously you do have reason to complain . 
  well not really , in a participatory democracy such as exists in greece , your ability to control the system rests with your ability to vote , to campaign , to be involved . 
  if you choose to not be involved and then are annoyed , then that 's basically just tough shit . 
   yep , i 'm gon na vote for my plumber and he will be the next president . 
  just like that . 
  gee , you obviously do n't live in a fantasy world . 
  do you have any idea how the major parties get financed ? 
  so stop fucking voting for them . 
  convince your neighbours and your friends and your family and your colleagues that all the major parties are as shit as you think they are , and get them to do the same . 
  that 's how democracy works , you convince enough people that option x is shit and option y is better , and then option y wins out . 
   and people vote for them because there are no other options . 
  that 's such a childish get out . 
  no other options meaning the other options are really ** god damn hard ** is what you mean . 
  i agree with what you 're really saying , the other options are really god damn hard , but * really fundamentally * changing the political system of the us would take far more than one person and huge commitment of time and work , but it can be done . 
  changing the system for 320 million people is n't going to be easy , but if you care about doing it you have to be like ron paul or gary johnson or some other politician who 's never going to win but keeps on trying year after year after year . 
  those guys do n't bitch and whine about how impossible it is to change the system , they just bloody well try to change it . 
  i ca n't say i agree with their politics , but at least they 're fucking doing something , what the hell are you doing ? 
   let me know when you wake up from your coma and realize how the world works . 
   if voting changed anything , they 'd make it illegal . 
  haha !, 
  yes !, 
  high-larious !, 
  let me wake you up from your coma and and realise how the world works : things change if you get off your fucking ass and actually do something . 
  the world was made by man , and it can be unmade and remade by man . 
  thinking you as an individual have no power is the first mistake to make .
