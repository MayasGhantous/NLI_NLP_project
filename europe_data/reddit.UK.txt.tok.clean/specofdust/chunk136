  the idea that the germans would bankroll the greeks just so the greeks could pay back * french * banks before they collapse is just ... weird . 
  this also ignores the fact that even german and french exposure to greek debt is only about 45 % of the amount that the eu has bailed greece out for already . 
  that is to say , if the germans and french were truly worried about their banks , it 'd be cheaper just to give the money to the banks than to bail out greece just for it to collapse later on . 
  so i suppose what i 'm saying is , is that if the germans ( and others ) are truly bailing out greece just to ensure banks get their money back , they 're doing it in a round about way which is adding $ 100 billion or so onto the bill . 
  hence this course of action seems unlikely due to it 's extreme insanity and it seems much more likely that they actually ** are ** trying to save the greek economy , whether you will accept it or not as a country . 
  i wish there was more general awareness of these sorts of figures in greece , because i feel like if people understood that the money the eu has spent on greece is already rapidly approaching the amount greece owes the entire world , then they would understand that the eu is actually trying to save their economy , and not just bail out its own banks which it already could have done , far more cheaply , far more simply , and without having people start hating them for helping them . 
  these guys are seriously lucky they 're not getting shot . 
  paint and rocks can be dealt with by tear gas and truncheons , but molotov cocktails can and do seriously harm . 
  that said , clearly there are lots of people at the protest so there 's bound to be the odd fucktard who wants to fight . 
   according to the [ 1 ] latest polls ( unfortunately it is in jpgs in greek , but there is a [ 2 ] pdf also in greek in the same page ) pasok would lose by a [ 3 ] wide margin . 
  right , but new democracy would be re-elected ? 
  this is n't specific to greeks , but parties in power are always less popular when there 's not an election coming up . 
  how would collapsing the current government and getting nd back in be productive ? 
  ( i 'm sure i do n't need to remind you that their leader was the most recent to commit fraud the eu and lie to your entire country ) . 
  we have political terms for a reason , to give people a decent chance to make a difference before they 're judged , because in general a population is more impatient than reality demands for serious political change . 
  to that end , i would say attempting to collapse the government , ** especially ** when it would quite obviously either result in nd or ( maybe , just maybe ) pasok getting back in , seems utterly pointless and kind of unproductive in democratic terms . 
   another interesting question is `` do you thing think the country is headed in the correct direction ? '', 
  [ 4 ] 85 % say no . 
  really though , not many people in europe ( or much of the world ) are going to feel their country is headed in the right direction . 
  i think people tend to be fairly downbeat about the world , it seems to be in our nature . 
  we complain constantly , we bemoan our violent unsocial world when all the actual evidence says we 're living in the most peaceful century of the entirity of human history , and are far more socially aware and active than ever before . 
  i 'm not saying people are stupid or anything , just that i think it 's easy to lose perspective of what we 've gained , and all that good progress that 's made every single year , while focussing on the problems of the moment . 
  it 's part of what makes humanity so productive and active , but it 's not great for perspective . 
   ... but i totally disagree with this . 
  it is not preventing a collapse of the greek economy but it postpones it until it has covered its ass . 
  in fact the austerity has caused a greater depression than expected in the greek economy this year . 
  the current policy has been far from beneficial for greeks . 
  it 's prevented it so far though , has n't it ? 
  the goal is to prevent the collapse , and so far , it 's worked . 
  as someone or other further up said earlier on , it 's because the eu is loaning greece money that public sector workers are still getting paid . 
  that seems pretty beneficial to me . 
  the long term prospects for greece if it collapses are very , very poor . 
  the chances of preventing a default may be low , but even if they 're 10 % it 's worth it , because the effects of a greek default would be ... unpleasant . 
  edit : as for the downvotes , i appreciate your sentiment pmksb98 , but there 's a portion of / r/europe who seem to hate me for stating facts , and suggesting that austerity measures and bailouts may be the way forward . 
  yeah but it made me smile when i read your post and thought of it so i put it out there . 
  cheapness of joke acknowledged though , and i 'm enjoying the discussion too , 
  that 'll save germany a few bob . 
   one of the goals of the protest is to cause the fall of the current government , by putting pressure on enough government mps in order for them to not vote the current austerity bill . 
  so people are not protesting to their government , but against it . 
  how democratic is that though ? 
  would pasok win an election if one were held now ? 
  i do n't know the numbers , but i 'm not willing to assume out of hand that just because there are protests that they would n't . 
  if they would win , then it 's not exactly very participatory in the democratic process to try to fell the government . 
  if the protesters are trying to cause the fall of the current government , who do they have lined up to replace them ? 
  who * is * going to fix the problems ? 
  what candidates have been considered for which positions ? 
  you see my point ? 
  there 's no point shooting the old guy if you have no-one to replace him . 
   i understand that you might be content with your life , and see these protests as pointless , or with not enough momentum to change things . 
  i see them as unfocussed , at times violent and childish , and depressing . 
   you should wonder , however , why despite of the popular opposition , european governments continue to direct funds at greece . 
  because it benefits us , obviously . 
  greece would n't get hundreds of billions out of generosity , and it 's a curious person that would think it should . 
  people accuse the eu of covering it 's own ass by bailing out greece , you 're damn right it 's covering it 's ass !, 
  incidentally , it 's also preventing a total collapse of the greek economy , which is beneficial for the greeks . 
  the germans probably could change the policy , as for what it would take ? 
  a lot of stupidity . 
  no , these protests are about getting * someone else * to fix it . 
  that 's the stupid thing about a lot of the protests going on these days , people are protesting * to * their government , * about * their government . 
  you want to fix things , start working on creating new governments to vote in , selecting people , having run offs , actually taking part in democracy instead of just being angry ( do stay angry , it 's just , it 's got to be directed productively ) . 
  so fix it . 
  so vote in politicians who 'll change the law . 
  the only reason it has any effect though is because people trust s&p and moody 's etc. 
  to give useful information . 
  if their information was political bs then the markets would n't trust them , and their information would be meaningless and have no effect upon the market . 
  credit ratings agencies tell the world what is already true , they do not make something true by announcing it to the world as fact . 
  moody 's have downgraded something which was worth the same yesterday as it is today , it just was n't worth as much yesterday as people thought it was yesterday . 
  not necessarily . 
  however if they are upon actual inspection as opposed to just speculation , it would most likely be wise to punish them at a later opportunity , given that they are actually fixing the economy right now . 
  indeed , but as minister for foreign affairs he probably would n't have been acting like a chancellor . 
  as pm he 's doing a pretty bloody good job , and it seems like it 's him and his cabinet which uncovered the whole mess in the first place . 
  that said , i agree with walkereu 's suggestion that eu teams take over economic control of greece for the time being . 
  they do n't actually have to do what he tells them . 
  he can order `` his '' ( meaning , the ones from his party ) mp 's around because they 're part of this party , and if they 're seen to be mp 's which do n't vote with the party they risk a much harder time being promoted within the party , or even expulsion if they do it enough . 
  it 's yet another argument against party politics imo , but no-one seems to ever consider that we could have politics without parties . 
  says the daily mail . 
  they 're not the same people though . 
  just because they 're from the same party , does n't make them the same people . 
  papandreou is actually doing a rather good job of sorting shit out . 
   the average greek is very much innocent in this case . . their country is falling apart all around them and they do n't even understand why . . while all the `` elites '' who caused this problem seem to be trying to shift blame elsewhere to protect their position/power/income . 
  that 's not strictly true . 
  do n't get me wrong , i think the guys who were running the show for the last couple of decades up to papandreou should be given hefty jail terms , along with their entire executive cabinets , but the greek people live in a democracy , and therefore have to accept some of the blame . 
  they elected irresponsible politicians in an environment in which ultimately has the ability to stand for election . 
  whether responsibility is accepted or not though , the greek people will be paying for it i suppose . 
  i completely agree , although i do understand the anger , i think it 's simply a lack of belief/understanding in macroeconomics , as seefor says . 
  regardless , it 's an apparently unpopular point of view judging from the number of downvotes myself and others get for saying it . 
  you and the rest of europe . 
  i think ultimately it 's important to look at what the greek government is doing , not what a minority ( or even majority ) of greek people are saying . 
  so far , the greek government seems to be making pretty impressive progess . 
  they started out from a really shitty position , but they seem to be doing well at making the right choices , so kudos to them . 
   this small groups of violent protesters have you seen the videos ? 
  this was not some small group of rioters , there were plainly a fairly large number . 
  additionally , the idea that a small group of rioters is likely to cause over $ 2m of damage seems fairly absurd . 
   so they seem to be rather shady to me . 
  they seem shady to you because you want to imagine them that way . 
  this is what i am saying discredits the cause , people need to accept that people on all sides of the political spectrum can be violent assholes . 
  like i said in some other thread , the left is going to have a seriously hard time convincing anyone of their beliefs until they take care of the violence which occurs so often at protests themselves , by actively helping the police to arrest those who are violent . 
  but it used to be different . 
  cheese and onion was green , salt and vinegar was blue . 
  walkers screwed everything up a few years ago .
