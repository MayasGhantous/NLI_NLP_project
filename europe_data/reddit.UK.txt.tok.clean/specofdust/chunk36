  secondly , this : < http://strangemaps.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/blond_hair_map1.jpg&gt and this : < http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_h6xw_a4tyus/syjoxaynh_i/aaaaaaaaalg/nlsujc6dfny/s400/blue_eyes_map2.jpg&gt; then there 's the fact that about 80 % of swedes are not of a `` foreign background '' ( sweden 's national stat collection seems a bit iffy on collecting colour stats ) . 
  so , we 've got overwhelmingly white , we 've got very blue eyed , we 've got lots of blondes . 
  so , that 's how i know . 
  right , i get that , and it 's a touching article , but still , it 's ridiculous to call that an `` oudated '' stereotype , it 's still completely accurate . 
   we swedes who do not fit the outdated blond , blue-eyed stereotype of what a true swede should look like . 
  wot ? 
  that 's precisely what most swedes look like . 
  that 's the stereotype and it 's still accurate . 
  you hitler you !, 
  always jokin ... 
  i see your reasoning on the latter ( not sure i agree , but i see it ) - what do you claim is misogynist about the party though ? 
  i now strongly suspect you 've never tasted any real decent cheddar . 
  i too eat sticky glue paste as a child ... 
  potato . 
  how on earth could you consider it otherwise ? 
  this is a remarkably well put point edit : oh noes , a cybernat got me ... 
  i 'd have to say `` meh '' to both . 
  i would largely say no to multiculture though . 
  being 1 council * candidate * out of about 1800 who * put themselves forward * for it is in no way `` climbing the ranks '' . 
  not annulling them , just going forward that all legal partnerships between couples have their rights and responsibilities founded in civil partnership legislation . 
   even if the rights and responsibilities are equal , giving separate names implies difference . 
  well as i say i would make the divide between religious and non-religious , perfectly happy for myself to only have a civ partnership available . 
  that would be a difference indeed , between the religious and non-religious . 
   first of all , a religious history does not mean it is appropriate in today 's more secular society . 
  no , but it means a lot to them still , a lot more than to anyone else ( in a genuine sense ) . 
  it costs us nothing to let them keep their word . 
   and what about gay couples who would like to be ` married ' ? 
  well , they can get a civil partnership . 
  if it 's about the religion , take it up with god but `` he '' does n't like gays very much going by the books i 've read . 
  if it 's about the word , well , then it 's just pettiness and a desire to deny the religious something which means a lot to them and nothing much to anyone else . 
  well are n't you a rude one . 
   highlighted in comments like ` pe stops you being gay ' that was the commentary of one councillor candidate , hardly ukip policy any more than the odd racist tory makes them racist , ken ? 
   `` equal but separate '' is not equal . 
  i 'd largely agree , but i do n't really see the point of quibbling over it if it , so long as the legal rights are the same for both , what 's the fuss if it 's marriage or civil partnership ? 
   water fountains for whites only and blacks only in 1950s america - not equality . 
  that was n't equal because blacks got massively inferior services than whites did . 
  if blacks had had identical services , then yes , it would have been equal . 
   and besides that , how can the church , or indeed any one religion , claim ownership of all marriage ? 
  because religion has essentially owned the concept for at least a millennia . 
  i 'm not religious , but i 'd be happy to have religion owning it completely , and all of us who are n't wanting religious marriages just get civil partnerships . 
  i 'd have no issue with that for myself . 
  can you elaborate on that please ? 
  they would seem to be the same thing , i 'm not sure what you mean by the difference . 
  and here we go again ... 
  anyone who votes for a party which promises immigration reform is instantly xenophobic . 
  does everything have to start and end with shouty name calling ? 
   i understand that some of these votes are out of protest , but the ones that are serious ... do they genuinely believe banning gay marriage as a good thing ? 
  they want all of the rights attached to marriage to be available to gay couples , the only thing they 're really not into is giving the term `` marriage '' to gay couples . 
  not * such * a big deal . 
  how is that xenophobic in any way ? 
  because of their social policies ? 
  all music would then be legally downloadable , right ? 
  in the uk the numbers of muslims who would n't report a terrorist act they knew would occur are in the double digit percentages ( that 's from the guardian a while back iirc ) . 
  the beliefs are actually pretty fucking terrible . 
   http://www.pewforum.org/muslim/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-infographic.aspx pretty awful frankly . 
  the first h there is not necessary . 
  a poor man surrounded by millionaires is still poor . 
  pot meet kettle . 
  what utter morons . 
  get rid of free publicly accessible data which benefits anyone who cares to use it , impinges upon privacy no more than any old joe driving the street would , and for no better reason than petty `` i do n't like google '' bullshit . 
  idiots . 
  idiots all of them !, 
  why would it be on bbc.co.uk ? 
  that 's not a news website . 
  also - people visit that ? 
  it 's front centre on news.bbc.co.uk, 
  why do we give a fuck about adopting russian kids ? 
  i mean obviously if we can raise kids in a developed country it 's preferable to them growing up in a developing country , but still , it 's their right to refuse us this as they do with anything else that suits their needs . 
  instead of pandering and whining we should just tell them they 're welcome to make any changes to national law which they desire to . 
  the wto should bitchslap the french and remind them that they 've agreed to play in a global community . 
  just the standard french bullshit i know , but still , gets annoying . 
   first off , it 's not hostage , it 's blocking them inside the building that 's essentially the same thing . 
  if the men are n't free to leave then that 's the same as a hostage situation . 
  ah it 's sunday mate , everyone deserves a day of blarghawargha . 
  just pin , not pin number - since you know what the initialism stands for i wo n't bother to expand on that , 
  it 's completely a culture thing . 
  actually ... [ there ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dj-ka2whhlo/unzr8agpvqi/aaaaaaaafh4/f6rrtvn7q6i/s1600/screen+shot+2012-12-22+at++saturday,+december+22,+9.26+pm.png ) [ is ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/asylumapplicants.jpg ) [ an argument to be made ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/uk_net_migration.png ) edit : sorry , that 2nd image is asyum applications by year , third is overall legal immigration . 
   statistically yes , they are . 
  for a variety of reasons . 
  right . 
  and statistically speaking , they also commit more crime . 
  sorted ? 
   i ca n't believe we were literally the last bastion in europe against racism in the largest war ever fought , and people are coming out with this kind of shit . 
  we fought to guarantee the independence of ourselves , and others , and to stop the slaughter of others in their homelands . 
  if i hear my neighbour beating his wife and i kick his door down and stop him , that does n't mean i have a duty to let her live in my flat afterwards . 
  also tbh given the whole british empire thing in the 1950 's it 's hardly accurate to say we were fighting racism in that war . 
   however , that is not a free pass to start blaming poverty on the amount of melanin in somebody 's skin . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  i do n't think there are many out there who still do this , sure there are probably still * some * bioracists out there still but most people are discriminating on grounds of culture ( not something i 'd call racism but something i fully accept that the left especially will term `` racism '' ) . 
  hence you 'll find people 's attitudes to a fully britishised guy whos granny came from trinidad and their attitudes towards a somali who immigrated 2 years ago will be radically different . 
  you saying non-whites are poorer ? 
  yeah , no-one honestly believes that 's a coincidence . 
  i 've spent a good few months in your place , pretty decent indeed !, 
  i enjoyed the whole getting drunk in a sauna before playing in the freezing cold thing , a whole new twist on getting drunk . 
  you lot definitely have the same attitude to drink as us though ( it 's * always * appropriate ) - i 've met people who think it 's odd to go for an early lunch at 11am and have a few beers with it . 
  you lot are to the nordic countries as the scots are to the uk . 
  to be downvoted in this place is no loss , 
  no of course not , there are 320 million americans afterall . 
  absolutely . 
  still , does n't help with the whole england = uk misconception .
