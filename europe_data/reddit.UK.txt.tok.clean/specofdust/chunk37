  i 'm not the one who made a thread to whine about some intern in a foreign country getting some flags wrong , 
  i do n't watch the thing , lacking a tv an ' all . 
  an accurate enough synonym , but yes you have a point . 
  yes , i 'm familiar with the subreddit and the name also annoys me there since it 's clearly in use a british sub , not the english one . 
  however if you 're going to go on about how a tv channel are getting thing 's wrong , you would do well to get things right yourself . 
  britain 's bbc . 
  if you 're going to complain about misrepresentation ... do it accurately , 
  that 's kind of insane . 
  i never said there were n't any stupid britons . 
  that is indeed how it would appear from your previous post . 
  do n't pay much attention to what the denizens of this subreddit think , they 're mostly a bunch of retards . 
  as for britain being `` european '' or not , we are , and short of an act of god to physically move our landmass we shall continue to be so for a few million years or so . 
  whether we 're part of the eu is another issue , but i guess as a canadian you did n't pick up on the difference between the two yet ... 
  at a stretch and with effort you can * maybe * claim to be * half * of the thing that everyone else in this subreddit was naturally born to be quite completely . 
  you must be so proud , you 're almost in a category with another half billion people  edit : [ as we say in the uk ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akbyg4jb5uc ), 
  born in canada , raised in canada , happened to have a parent who gave enough of a shit to teach their native language , and got a polish passport by right of parentage to make schengen easy . 
  i got you figured out canuck !, 
  canadian . 
  you 're in / r/europe , we do n't give a shit about your `` heritage '' . 
  you 're canadian , and yanks are american . 
  not half irish-half-polish-half-imaginary american . 
  western forces are more than capable of fighting a proper big war , that 's the shit we excel at . 
  coin on the other hand needs a lot of work before we 're as good as we need to be at it . 
  the west is more than prepared to take on russia and china for the time being , if it comes to it . 
  i mean , defence spending of over a trillion usd ( that 's about 1 out of every 70 dollars the * entire world * generates ) , 3.5 million troops , the most advanced technology in the world ( by quite some margin ) . 
  we 're good . 
  so many cunts in this thread ... 
  that 's because you 're canadian -_-, 
  i did n't say otherwise , i just think it 's kind of borderline entertaining that mo4gv9eywmpmw3xr is n't happy about people using the word `` kurwa '' liberally , when a great number of poles under the age of 40 seem to feel the requirement to use it in every single sentence in public , as if everyone does n't know they 're saying the polish offence-level-equivalent of `` fuck '' constantly . 
  silence prisoner ... 
  it 's a standard refrain that we `` deserve '' or `` must accept '' mass immigration because the british empire existed ( as if every other country was n't trying but just failing to build an empire ) . 
  to hell with all that though . 
  i actually kind of agree with farage on immigration , i just disagree with him on the eu . 
  imo if we just made extra-eu immigration very difficult we 'd do well . 
  not like we ca n't get enough take-away workers from the eu if we 're short of them ( which we 're not ) . 
  she 's no jeremy paxman that 's for sure . 
  i would think poles living in the uk would be aware that we * all * know what kurwa means by now . 
  poland can not into west ? 
  do n't about half your citizenry do so ? 
  natch dude , we 're in europe  real traditions tend to be a millennia or two old . 
  i guess because people use `` england '' when they mean the uk , and it kind of relegates your existence to a province of englandshire , which is n't the nicest feeling in the world . 
  also it 's fucking retarded and any adult in the western world should know better . 
   many foreigners who learn that they 're talking with a pole will start repeating kurwa every few words - i know they do that in good intentions , but it 's a really offensive word and i would prefer they would n't do that . 
  then why do i hear it constantly in my local supermarket ? 
  might as well be tbh . 
  god damnit . 
  fuck these cunts . 
  sincerely , a scientist . 
  i see no difference between nato and the eu in military terms . 
  you would be bound by either one to fight for your fellow members if they are attacked . 
  i never said it was european , i said it was the only eu defence force in existence , it 's the only group capable of defending the eu in a serious shooting war . 
  it 's not purely european , but that does not mean it is not the case that it 's the only group which seriously protects the eu . 
  that is the case . 
  it may not be a primarily military alliance , but common defence is part of the lisbon treaty - it 's an alliance , and sweden is not neutral . 
  iran is no worse to rely on than russia , however the nabucco opens up all the stans in a russia free manner , and that 's worth it immensely . 
  germany is insane getting into bed with the russians in the way it is . 
  quite so my friend . 
  my bad , just did a quick ole ' check of the wackapedia to check declaration of war dates . 
  should have checked against invasion dates . 
  we were still incredibly close to being occupied and invaded . 
  most of the world had given up on us by early 1940 . 
  denmark and norway both did it . 
  benelux too . 
  my country jumped into two world wars based on , essentially , doing what was right . 
  i must say i 've a fairly keen sense of awareness that sometimes the right thing to do is the thing which must be done even if it seems unlikely to succeed . 
  it depresses me somewhat that anyone in europe would not feel this way , given what our continent has been through . 
  right yes , war is over forever and we 're entering a golden dawn of peace and prosperity which will never end . 
  you call my lot conspiracy theorists because we find war in the next half century conceivable . 
  we call you lot idiots . 
  so instead they did healthy business with the nazis for the bulk of the war selling lots of iron and getting rich and fat while the wehrmacht trains rolled through the country off to move troops between norway or finland or denmark . 
  plenty of countries entered ww2 with no hope of winning in the short term - sometimes you do what 's right even if hope seems all but lost . 
  in france they shaved the heads of women who collaborated with the nazis . 
  if they 'd done that in sweden it would have been a nation of skinheads . 
  well yes of course that 's practically a tautology to say such a thing it 's so evident . 
  perhaps i was n't clear enough but what i meant to say is that in terms of supplying a decent chunk of any nation 's oil supply , we 're yet to see how fracking will get on . 
  the stuff you take up can be largely crap , requires a lot of new tech to be developed to improve the process , requires a lot of processing by us chemists . 
  it 's still very complicated and there are still lots of problems . 
  i know mate , all of them should be ashamed too . 
  they 're in a mutual defence alliance and yet only two countries in the entire thing are actually fulfilling their obligations . 
  the reason i feel especially aggrieved about sweden is this claim of neutrality . 
  it 's like a situation where two friends are bullied , and one sticks up for the other in a pinch , but the other just looks away and hopes nobody notices them . 
  we will see , as someone with an interested ( and some academic edumakashun ) in oil recovery , fracking is absolutely not without its problems . 
  smart things are often cowardly . 
  it does not make them right . 
  well , as part of nato every nation must defend all of europe because it takes only a matter of minutes to traverse sweden and be in norwegian territory , and so forth . 
  it 's just irritating that countries like sweden and ireland still claim to actually be neutral . 
  they 're not , they ca n't be , and if they 're just too cheap to actually pay for their defence they should have the guts to actually admit that . 
  of course it is , just because it 's * also * the force which defends the us and canada ( and , realistically , a great many other countries ) does n't mean it 's not also the only semi-unified force capable of any serious defence of the eu . 
   not sure if you 've heard of this concept called national sovereignty . 
  yeah there was some memo about it a few years ago . 
  still though , sweden is dependent on nato for any serious defence , and yet spends a mere 1.23 % or so if it 's gdp on funding its own defence . 
  it 's like living in a neighbourhood which has a neighbourhood watch , not taking part , saying that you 'll take care of it yourself , but doing so by looking out your window once a month to see if there 's any murderers about . 
  and the idiot germans went right for it instead of getting in on the nabucco . 
  true to an extent , 450 in afghan , not much really , but not surprisingly low or anything . 
  the french were never really interested in afghan , and the germans always stuck to the safe parts where no combat would happen . 
  i agree sweden helped out in libya , but still , this whole neutrality bullshit has to end . 
  sweden ** ca n't ** be neutral as it 's part of the eu , same with austria and ireland . 
  eu countries should be nato countries , since for the time being , nato ** is ** the eu defence force . 
   the response from sweden was very poor , but given the extremely low chance of an attack it does n't make economic sense to keep fighters ready for instant take-off 24/7 . 
  right , so they stay out of the alliances with this ridiculous notion of `` independent armed neutrality '' knowing full well they 're not capable of defending themselves from more than an invasion by iceland , relying essentially entirely upon the eu and natos inevitable involvement in any major war to keep them safe .
