  so what ? 
  the idea that proximity should have any bearing on sovereignty is ridiculous . 
   this looks utter bs for an outsider . 
  if britain is the only country in the world which contains people who understand the right of self-determination then i am most happy that we are a nuclear armed nation . 
   it looks like uk trying to grasp the leftover of the empire . 
  but of course it 's not because we would quite happily give up any territory we own outside of the uk ( or even within it , as my own country may be leaving shortly ) if that is what the people of that place want . 
   it just does n't make sense geographically , politically or common-sensely . 
  geography is childish , if proximity earns territory than germany should own france . 
  the politics is clear , the people of the island desire to remain british . 
  as for the `` sense '' of it , it seems perfectly common sensical to me to respect the wishes of the people on the island . 
  you appear to support argentina 's colonial desires though . 
  strong military is good for maintaining western dominance of the world , which is absolutely an imperative for the 21st century . 
  we must strive for both . 
  and fuck the argentinians if they think they 're having a drop of the stuff in our territory . 
  i 'm going to enjoy watching us get wealthier still as they miss out on the 50 % of revenues we offered them as an act of good faith . 
  hand them back to whom ? 
  there was no-one on the falklands before it was colonised , and when it was , argentina did not exist , it was , ironically , a spanish colony . 
   citations are a measure of how many other scientists are referring to your work and are therefore a good indicator of its scientific value . 
  a good indicator , but not perfect . 
  citations correlate often with the fame of an author , or who they 've worked with . 
  i worry that the uk is riding on the wave of 1960 's era successes and scientific champions . 
   uk researchers generate more articles per researcher , more citations per researcher , and more usage per article authored than any other nation . 
  no offence , but as someone considering staying in academia long term , that attitude seriously worries me . 
  scientific research is as you admit very hard to quantify , but i think we need to be ** extremely ** wary of adopting the us approach of more articles = better , more overall citations = better . 
  many of the greatest scientific works to come out of britain came after scientists were allowed 3-5 years of pottering about and just gradually working on things and figuring them out . 
  i really worry that an adoption of the us model of `` publish or perish '' could be extremely damaging to our research as a country . 
  1.7 % compared with france 's 2.2 and germany 's 2.8 . 
  not to mention the nordics which are over 3 % , with the exception of norway which is doing pretty well even with low percentages , because their gdp is massive for their population . 
  it 's not good enough , we 're a service based economy with our manufacturing sector based purely in high tech , and most of our new development in our economy coming from high tech and highly advanced knowledge . 
  our r&d spending should be twice what it is . 
  are we really that efficient ? 
  i do n't understand what on earth would make us so , or why we would have such an advantage when we 're spending 1-2 % less of our gdp on research than so many other countries . 
  to maintain global military dominance ? 
  nail on the head with number 1 there . 
  as a brit i desire to maintain nato not just because all the eu spending is still dwarfed by us spending and military force , but because i trust nato to take action on issues , while i do n't trust a germany dominated eu at all . 
  so what you 're saying is you want to pull out of a military alliance to form a new one , which is essentially the same , but just getting rid of over 70 % of the military spending , and most of the power available to that alliance , by excluding a few countries ?? 
  seems crazy to me . 
  i 'm not entirely sure how the uk manages to be so bright when our r&d as a % of our gdp is now considerably lower than most similar developed nations . 
  you can also make out the faroes , and iceland , quite clearly . 
  it 's a security council . 
  other european countries dont have the sorts of militaries that we do , so it makes sense that the uk and fr are on it and other countries still not . 
  france and germany have a baby . 
  switzerland is born . 
  my advice ? 
  do n't eat your clothing before you wash it . 
   national pride is a national interest . 
  absolutely , ** national ** . 
  france can pay the $ 200 million themselves if they care so much about this horseshit . 
   no , the ftt is a tax on transactions . 
  just because coincidentally a lot of financial services are concentrated in london does not mean that this tax is designed to hit the uk . 
  there 's also a tax on alcohol , but you do n't hear france or italy whine that their wineries are being targeted . 
  we all produce alcohol , not just france and italy . 
   sweden was n't a center so the costs to relocate the transactions were practically nihil . 
  and still that 's the one example we have , a miserable failure . 
  you 're talking about the destruction of parts of the financial industry here , not just the fear that a few companies * might * leave . 
   all taxes are bad for business , it 's time to distribute the burden rather than letting workers pay almost all taxes and financials almost nothing . 
  financial institutions pay plenty already , we 're not going to start destroying their business model just because the plebs around europe hate them for not making enough money the last few years . 
   which they brought upon themselves . 
  rent is tax on economic activity . 
  `` down with bankers '' bullshit again . 
  the fsi contributes about 10 % of uk economic output , we 're not letting that be damaged . 
  the parliament moving twice per year otoh contributes very little to the french economy , and is literally just related to french concern with the size of their collective dicks . 
  you 're obviously interested in turning this into a discussion about the ftt , but there is no comparison between the two , and the parliament moving to strasbourg for half the year is a fucking joke , and i 'm tired of it being done with my money , as are most europeans . 
  france is just going to have to grow the fuck up about this . 
   it 's been accepted policy to distribute european institutions over countries , so that in itself is n't strange . 
  except in this case it 's costing us a large sum of money for no tangible benefit . 
   what is strange is that you ca n't see that the french unwillingness to let go of strasbourg is akin to the british unwillingness to allow financial transaction taxation not akin at all . 
  the french gain national pride from this , not much more . 
  we 're all paying $ 200 million to keep the french collective dick hard . 
  the ftt is essentially a tax on london , and has been tried out in sweden before ( failed massively ) and will not happen . 
  it 's bad for business , it 's a tax which predominantly affects the uk , and the whole thing is riding off a collective hatred for financial institutions right now . 
   ( but that france should probably host a major institution as well ) why ? 
  why do the french require this dick massage so badly ? 
  spain does n't whine , italy does n't whine , the uk does n't whine that there is n't a major eu institution based in any of these three countries . 
  why is it france * has * to have something important in its country just to feel part of the whole bloody thing ? 
  we 're spending a couple of hundred million a year on maintaining the french ego , and that 's frankly a complete piss take . 
  it 's fucking outrageous !, 
  do n't confuse low calorie with healthy . 
  a nip of scots would be more appropriate . 
   the fact that this proposal has men indignantly shaking in their boots on the continent it 's not about that . 
  i do n't mind competing , and in fact i 'm capitalist to the extent that i 'm ok with not getting a job if i think someone more suited for that job than i am got it . 
  what would irritate me would be knowing that someone who was less suited to that job got it because i happened to be born male . 
  as for the stock market thing , there are plenty of oil , shipping , mining , and security companies on the stock market . 
  fair enough . 
  you have tried i shall grant you that and you 've made a decent go of it . 
  ultimately i 'm fundamentally opposed to measures such as this , not just as an attack on the free market , but also as , essentially , an attack on men . 
  now if we 're to see quotas in every industry then i 'd disagree with that for being ridiculous , but at least it would be fair , in a messed up stupid way . 
  but as it is , it 's just the boardroom . 
  not the dangerous jobs . 
  not the low paid jobs . 
  not the jobs which have no dignity , no respect . 
  not the jobs where you get shot , or where you get spat on , or where you risk having your vital organs crushed . 
  for some reason the only place where the unequal gender balance needs to be fixed is in the high paying , high flying , highly desirably corporate boardroom . 
  i wonder why that is , eh ? 
  sure it does . 
  so mining firms will be hiring huge numbers of women soon then yeah ? 
  here 's the thing , as i said , two candidates will never be equal . 
  this law is asking companies to take two people who 're approximately equal , and then instead of deciding on other relevent factors , to make a decision based on gender . 
  it 's completely sexist , will be hugely selectively applied , and ultimately , is just really really lame . 
  candidates are never going to be exactly equal though , and this is clearly an attempt to slowly make companies reach the 40 % level .
