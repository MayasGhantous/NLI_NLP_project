  you germans and your compound words . 
  people have gone mental for scandinavian tv the last few years in the uk , i know sweden is only part of that but things like wallander and girl with a dragon tattoo have been very popular here . 
  i think it 's because we find scandinavian culture different enough to be interesting but similiar enough to not be jarring . 
  yeah i have seen british/european people say stuff like that , not sure about 99 times out of 100 but some do push that line . 
  it 's probably more ignorance than deception , most people are from cities or big towns and wo n't know about rural life . 
  there 's 2 million guns in the uk alone . 
  mostly shotguns and old rifles owned by farmers and people in rural areas but organised gangs and drug dealers have handguns , sub machine guns , etc. 
  the picture the nra for example paint of the uk being a completely gun free zone is a load of bollocks . 
  most people that live in cities and towns wo n't ever see a gun but they 're fairly common in the countryside . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but is n't this guy a sufi ? 
  in which case the nutty sunnis/salafists wo n't be interested in a word out of his mouth anyway ? 
  i like braquo ... 
  farage would glass the cunt . 
  sorry mate the anglo-dutch wars post is still fresh in my mind . 
  anglo-portuguese alliance still going fuckin strong . 
  strokes cat , twirls moustache ... 
  no one likes us , we do n't care . 
  winner gets the elgin marbles ... 
  i 'm roasting mate . 
  had to go up in the loft for ten minutes to get something , nearly suffocated . 
  i ca n't cope with this heat . 
  prick = penis , bum = arse !, 
  that sentence would have a very different meaning in england . 
  surely then if england is forced to stay in the eu against her will by voters from scotland ( or wales/ni ) then england should get a referendum on independence from the uk ? 
  exactly . 
  see the secondary migration of tens of thousands of somalians from the netherlands to the uk . 
  cheers for that lads :\\ it 's why i support the tories ramping up the rhetoric , we need to be seen as less of a soft touch for immigrants looking to take the piss . 
  if we make it clear you 're not getting an easy ride here hopefully the piss takers and trouble makers will all fuck off to sweden or somewhere instead . 
   though they would all accept the label british that 's just not true , lots of welsh and english people also reject the british label and identify solely as welsh or english . 
  what happened to wales ? 
  i think you missed a comma . 
  i bloody hope so , anyway . 
   most of the troublemakers were born and grew up as uk citizens . 
  that means that uk shares part of the blame for what they turned out to be . 
  most were born to people that were allowed in , this is my point . 
  if anjem choudary 's parents were n't given citizenship , there would be no anjem choudary in the uk working against us from within . 
  we 've invited a fifth column into our midst . 
  the only blame on the uk is for letting islamist lunatics in in the first place and for being far too soft on them . 
  we did n't fail someone like jihadi john ( who was n't even born here ) , he failed himself and his parents failed him by indoctrinating him into such a dangerous ideology . 
  which is why you should be extremely careful who you let into your country , and who you give citizenship to . 
  you do n't have to be such a swede about it m8 . 
  it 'd drive me insane to have to listen to that shite all day , fair play for sticking it out . 
  to me it is a sign of a decadent , complacent culture that is dying on it 's arse . 
  that level of self loathing and prioritising the needs of the out-group is very unhealthy . 
  long term it is tantamount to cultural suicide . 
  ha , it 's funny cos i had initially written a longer post with something very similar and then deleted it to keep it brief . 
  you 're spot on . 
  somehow , a significant number of people in the west have had their natural in-group bias and out-group hostility reversed . 
  they have been conditioned to despise their own people , their own history , their own culture . 
  they only see the negatives . 
  yet when it comes to the `` other '' , whoever that may be , they see only the positives , look the other way when they do wrong , make excuses for them , etc. 
  there are plenty of people like this on the uk subreddit , and this one . 
  i ca n't say i 've ever met anyone like it in real life so fuck knows where they live . 
  something has gone very wrong in our universities for starters . 
  it is a mental sickness and it needs to be ruthlessly confronted and eradicated . 
  the uk , sweden and germany are the worst culprits for these attitudes . 
  poland , czech republic , hungary , denmark , the baltics etc. 
  seem to have their heads screwed on . 
  your idiotic policies would lead to another hitler taking power . 
  people would n't just roll over . 
  they 'd vote for anyone who promised to stop it , by any means necessary . 
  thank fuck that barely anyone thinks like you in this country . 
   why any european would prefer their government to give their own resources to immigrants instead of their own people and their own children baffles me . 
  decades of propaganda and brainwashing . 
  that 's what it takes for so many people to go against basic human nature . 
  just saw your flair . 
  are you voting for trump mate or just having a laugh ? 
  lots of people think it 's a very big deal , and are very angry and worried about it . 
  it 's a large part of why parties like ukip , fn , pvv , sd , dpp , fpo , afd , etc. 
  are all on the rise . 
  fair question . 
  see below . 
  oh i 've got sources for days bruv . 
  read on my dutch friend , you might learn something ... ** multiple simultaneous attacks ** http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/628051/terror-streets-isis-unleash-co-ordinated-wave-attacks-european-cities  ** isis militants are set to launch a `` series of coordinated attacks across european cities '' ** in a plan to replicate paris terror on the streets of other countries . 
   ** the terror blitz will be happen `` all at once '' ** according to a former propaganda mastermind of the islamic state group . 
   he told german intelligence officers that senior isis commanders asked him , along with other fighters , if he would `` bring jihad back to their homeland '' . 
   he then detailed a plan to carry out a europe-wide terror attack . 
   he said : ** '' they want something that happens everywhere at the same time . 
  ** http://www.ibtimes.com/isis-europe-2016-more-paris-style-sleeper-cellattacks-eu-expected-defense-experts-2310618  `` the next attack is likely to be bigger , '' former french intelligence official claude moniquet , head of the european strategic intelligence and security center in brussels , told politico . 
  ** `` the type of attack that intelligence and security agencies are preparing for now is a coordinated attack in multiple sites , in several major cities -- two to four . '' ** http://www.politico.eu/article/eu-eyes-isil-sleepers-for-next-major-attack-terrorism-isis-paris-bataclan-counter-terrorism-islamic-state-european-strategic-intelligence-and-security-center-syria-iraq-war/  their working scenario resembles the paris tragedy , but on a vaster scale -- with ** commando teams attacking soft targets in several countries at once ** , according to terrorism experts in france , britain and the united states who were briefed on non-public discussions . 
  ** war of attrition , long term threat , paris and brussels a smokescreen for bigger plots ** http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/03/brussels-attacks-eu-terror-problem-worse-160323082251601.html  tuesday 's deadly terrorist attacks in brussels are yet another reminder that the scourge of ** terrorism in europe is a long-term problem that may very well get worse before it gets better . 
  **  without doubt , ** the eu is faced with the reality that a long-term threat from terrorist attacks ** inside its borders is an issue it will have to deal with from a security standpoint , as well as socially and politically . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/25/isis-plans-export-chaos-europe-paris-brussels  in what marked a critical phase in the group 's evolution , there was to be a ** new focus on exporting chaos to europe ** , the assembled men were told . 
  and up to 200 militants were in place across the continent ready to receive orders . 
   senior leaders said they were ** turning their focus to european capitals ** , and had dispatched foreign fighters back to their homelands to ** prepare attack plans . 
  and wait . 
  **  instead , the group now had the capacity to take the fight to the heart of its enemy . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/29/isil-using-lone-wolf-attackers-in-europe-as-smoke-screen-for-lar/  ** isil is flooding europe with low-level , unsophisticated attack plans to swamp intelligence agencies while larger atrocities are secretly plotted ** , a senior counter-terrorism judge has warned . 
  ** bigger attacks , incl . 
  soft targets ** http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/07/isis-planning-enormous-and-spectacular-attacks-uk-counter-terrorism-chief-warns  rowley , who leads on counter-terrorism for scotland yard , told a media briefing on monday that the nature of the threat from isis , which he calls daesh , was changing . 
  `` in recent months we 've seen a broadening of that , much more plans to attack western lifestyle . 
  going from that narrow focus on police and military as symbols of the state to something much broader . 
  and you see ** a terrorist group which has big ambitions for enormous and spectacular attacks , not just the types that we 've seen foiled to date . 
  ** ''  previously , isis had been thought to be trying to incite individuals to stage small-scale attacks , possibly using knives or vehicles . 
  it had been hoped that tougher laws had made the planning and execution of larger-scale `` spectaculars '' next to impossible . 
   but after the paris attack and alleged plotting in europe , rowley and other ** counter-terrorism chiefs fear that isis has the capability and intent to stage a mass-casualty attack in the west . 
  ** ** nuclear sites ** http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/504803/evil-islamic-state-isis-isil-daesh-nuclear-warfare-chilling-report-warns  now it 's thought isis lone wolf attacks could be a smokescreen distracting security services from plans for an apocalyptic atrocity in europe . 
   it follows reports that ** belgian brothers ibrahim and khalid el bakraoui -- two of brussels suicide bombers -- filmed a top nuclear official at a flanders facility . 
  **  authorities in belgium have also confirmed that the ** paris attack terrorists filmed a nuclear power plant boss ** using a camera hidden in the bushes outside his home . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/11/drones-terrorist-attacks-security-thinktank  it lists a range of potential targets including foreign embassies , ** nuclear power stations ** , a g7 summit or the prime minister 's car .
