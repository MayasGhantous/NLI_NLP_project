  ** worse threat since the aftermath of iraq ** http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/britain-facing-worse-terror-threats-6015845  ** britain is facing worse terror threats than 10 years ago ** , warns ex-counter terrorism boss  the threat from isis is very different to that posed by al qaeda at the time of the 7/7 bombings , warns peter clarke , former head of scotland yard 's counter terrorism command  at the moment we are arresting one person for terror related crimes every day . 
  that 's the highest rate at any point in 15 years apart from the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and 7/7 . 
  ** football stadiums ** http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/terrorists-planned-three-bombs-german-stadium-hanover  ** terrorists planned to detonate three bombs inside the stadium during a friendly international football match ** in hanover last week , an attack that was thwarted by cancelling the match at the last minute , according to a security official . 
  http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/593187/islamic-state-isis-drones-bomb-crowds-football-festivals-britain  islamic state ( isis ) are plotting to use toy drones to bomb major events like ** football matches ** and music festivals in britain , it emerged today . 
   colonel richard kemp , who has advised the government on terrorism , told the mirror : `` there is a genuine threat from islamists wishing to deliver high explosives by drone to crowded areas . 
  the effects could be devastating . '', 
  my arse must be pretty bloody big to have pulled all that out of it , eh ? 
  this is what they are known to be planning . 
  multiple attacks in multiple capitals on the same day . 
  paris and brussels were just the opening salvo , probing for weaknesses . 
  this is going to be a war of attrition , they are going to attack us in dribs and drabs for months if not years . 
  security services thought they had a handle on things before isis got big , the spectacular plots by al-qaeda were drying up and it was just small fry nutters with a knife they had to worry about . 
  now islamist terror is back in a big way in the west . 
  they are going for planes , nuclear sites , football stadiums , government and military targets , you name it . 
  things are going to get a lot worse before they get better so everybody had better buckle up . 
  if the moderates can be converted that easily then they 're not moderates . 
   surprisingly , the uk has always been the biggest proponent of further expansion eastwards . 
  and now they 're the ones most complaining about immigrants . 
  that 's because the first group were politicians , and the second group are the actual people that have to live with the decisions that the first group make . 
  the british people never wanted all this immigration , even when you go back to the 60 's the polling had a big majority wanting less immigration . 
  the french have never been invested in the european project . 
  they still think they have an empire . 
  they are holding the eu back , and once they leave further integration can begin . 
   all of the paris guys were eu citizens , not refugees . 
  two were iraqi refugees . 
  yeah mate i saw a documentary on the bbc about gu\u00e9delon , it was fascinating . 
  got nothing but respect for the people working on that , my skills just about extend to putting up a shelf !, 
  hope you get the chance to do it . 
   i might even do some form of `` apprenticeship '' at a castle under construction ( it 's a volunteering project , think a bit like reenactment . 
  would this be at gu\u00e9delon castle by any chance ? 
  that 's an egregious slur on one of africa 's finest nations . 
  the welsh are just as eurosceptic as the english , if not more . 
  oh good . 
  at least now we know juncker 's reddit account . 
  also a bbc series now . 
  worth a watch . 
  if there was no eu then greece and italy would have been forced to defend their borders . 
  italy were actually doing push backs to africa until the echr stuck their noses in and fined them 15 grand for each migrant . 
  with no eu , no way for migrants to go all the way from turkey to northern europe , no welcome mat by germany and sweden , nowhere near as many people would have made the journey in the first place . 
  they 're not running from something , they 're running towards something . 
  i have a feeling this comment will be to this referendum as `` have you been watching too much braveheart ? '', 
  was to the scottish referendum . 
  this idea that europe can not defend our borders and therefore we have no choice but to accept tens of millions of illegal immigrants from the shitholes of the planet is absolute nonsense . 
  we have the money , the technology and the military might to do so . 
  we just do n't have the political will at the moment . 
  if and when it becomes an existential crisis for europe then people will very quickly change their tunes and be willing to elect leaders that do have the political will to act . 
  leaders that will make hard choices and do ` bad ' things - tear up treaties , sanction force against illegal immigrants and put europeans first . 
  if the natives of the americas and oceania had had the ability to stop europeans from colonising and genociding them then they obviously would have . 
  to say that we are similarly impotent is patently ridiculous . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'm sure you 're right that project fear will kick in , i suspect it might backfire a bit like it did in scotland though . 
  especially if people like merkel and juncker wade in . 
   meanwhile , police have arrested four syrians , aged between 14 and 21 , over the suspected gang rape of two teenage girls in the southern german town of weil am rhein on new year 's eve , according to german media . 
   `` of the 31 suspects whose names are known , 18 have asylum seeker status , '' interior ministry spokesman tobias plate told reporters on friday , citing federal police figures . 
   the suspects include nine algerians , eight moroccans , four syrians , five iranians , two germans and one each from iraq , serbia and the us , he said . 
  you 're misinformed . 
  the ones with fake passports bearing the names ` ahmad al-mohammed ' and 'm al-mahmod ' were not believed to be french citizens . 
  they came in with the migrants from turkey to leros . 
  they look like iraqis to me but who knows . 
  not true . 
  we have 20k somalians with dutch citizenship in the uk , 20k indians with portuguese citizenship , many nigerians with german citizenship , etc. 
  if sweden and germany decide to give citizenship to all these migrants there 's nothing we can do to prevent them from coming here if we 're in the eu . 
   at the moment the polling is about 50/50 but it will change when it gets closer to the date and people actually think about the costs & benefits in the scottish referendum no started out the year with a 15-20 % lead but on the day only had a 10 % lead . 
  out of interest why do you expect the numbers to break the other way in this referendum ? 
  the bbc does allow comments . 
  the ` posters with eu flags are statistically more likely to be utter twats ' observation is looking bang on the money . 
   immigration is n't a new phenomenon , and it 's certainly not affected the uk at least in any meaningful way . 
  you must be having a fucking laugh . 
   what 's your problem with england ? 
  he 's french . 
  https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/12/09/brits-oppose-muslim-policy-pockets-approval the petition got 500k signatures yeah but so did the one calling to shut our borders completely . 
  the mainstream narrative in the media and from politicians is that trump 's comments were divisive , bigoted , reprehensible , etc. 
  but as yougov shows lots of people agree with the sentiments . 
  i 'm not a fan of trump and i ca n't see him winning . 
  i expect it 'll be hillary although i do n't like her either and i 'm not sure how she 's polling at the moment . 
   i do n't know anyone in britain who agrees with trump , it 's just nutters and fruitcakes , but this thread would fucking love him . 
  how many people have you actually asked ? 
  according to yougov 25 % of people in the uk agree with trump . 
  we also have 20k indians with portuguese citizenship here . 
   `` germany will help all people who are looking for protection from wars and persecution , '' she said , adding that it is just as important to return people who came for economic reasons to germany . 
  jesus , she 's still repeating this line . 
  does merkel not realise how many people in the world qualify under those terms ? 
  does she not realise her words are a green light to them to make the journey ? 
  what you 're describing is n't a european phenomenon . 
  it 's a human one . 
  the second gen is the most radical . 
  until the third gen. 
  this whole thing has reminded me of this scene in austin powers , with the eu and various leaders being the security guard : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qllugilkqms, 
  plurality . 
  do n't say that , the french will start launching the fuckers over the channel at us . 
  that 's in egypt bruv . 
  we need a `` shake it all about '' campaign . 
  i 'm just laughing thinking how fucking mental the uk would be going if we were facing 1.5 million migrants in one year . 
  godspeed germany . 
  and what happens to all these afghans , pakistanis , iranians , etc. 
  that tear up their passports , get rumbled pretending to be syrian , but wo n't tell you where they 're from ? 
  how easy is it to deport them ? 
  it 'd better be pretty quick and easy for germany 's sake . 
   they 're incapable of playing well with others https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_wars,
