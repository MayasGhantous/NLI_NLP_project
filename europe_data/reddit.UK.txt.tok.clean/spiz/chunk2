  the second problem is that malta is selling citizenship to any country in the eu without any requirement for residence . 
  so in the worst case scenario if i 'm a shady russian mobster and things are n't going so well for me , i could buy maltese citizenship and flee to london , paris , berlin or even lillehammer without ever seeing malta . 
  there 's some mention of a clause to keep names secret , not sure what that 's about . 
  not * everywhere * in the uk is exactly like that . 
  glasgow on a saturday night is worse . 
  when alastair darling said , during the debate , that the price of oil is volatile and can drop unpredictably , and is not a good basis for government finances , salmond basically laughed him off . 
  we knew predictions are a stab in the dark and that 's why salmond fiscal stance made no sense . 
  garibaldi `` conquered '' italy in the 19th century starting off with about 1000 men , did n't he ? 
  it 's not quite 25 , but it 's not very many . 
  it 's a good start . 
  if unemployment continues to fall and the labour market begins to lose all its slack , the quality of jobs on offer will increase . 
  it 's what we saw here in the u.k. . now salaries are finally rising consistently above inflation . 
  in the u.k. the head of state is only limited to a single term . 
  ^ / joke . 
  that 's the thing about the south , if it 's not ` ndrangheta territory , you can write it off as camorra , sacra corona unita or cosa nostra territory . 
  the mafias extensive and are a bit of a problem . 
  it 's ok . you 're still well ahead in the car-burning league . 
  i have to assume the italians were on strike as the data was collected . 
  beppe grillo always calls for that . 
  along with not paying italy 's debt . 
  he 's just a crazy populist and people seem to vote for him out of dissatisfaction with politicians in general . 
  but the bottle wo n't say champagne unless it * is * champagne . 
  edit : in any case , we certainly distinguish between champagne , cava , prosecco , asti and so on . 
  if we want to use a generic term ( like in a supermarket ) they 're referred to as `` sparkling wines '' . 
  i 'd also be * very * surprised if either the french or the italians referred to spumante as champagne . 
  the punic wars and the common cold , mostly . 
  i think / u/deratatouille was making a making a pun on the acronym : eurozone votes for eurozone laws is the same acronym as evel , the conservatives ' english votes for english laws plan that the snp disagree with . 
  well , the eu will make the document public `` soon after '' negotiations are complete . 
  this information is available on the eu ttip faq website . 
  after that , the process of ratification will take several months to even start . 
  then it will have to be voted on in all the national parliaments , the eu and the us . 
  all in all , the process could take a couple of years according to a letter by the house of commons to the house of lords asking about this . 
  the document would be publicly available throughout all of this . 
  the action of entering the country needs to be judged for its legality . 
  at the point that a person has entered the country , we do n't know if he has done so legally or not . 
  some rulings are easy ( e.g. 
  they have a visa ) , others are more complex and take time to assess . 
  if the person is deemed to be a refugee , then entering will have been legal . 
  if they are found not to be refugees , then they will have entered the country illegally and should be deported . 
  refugees can not have entered illegally . 
  that 's why they 're refugees . 
  they 'll have arrived in a country with an unclear legal status . 
  then they ask for asylum . 
  the request is processed . 
  if they are found to satisfy criteria , they are awarded refugee status and are allowed into the country . 
  they would be illegal if they 're ** not ** refugees and do n't have a visa/residence permit . 
  the increase in regulation of banks in the u.k. is quite remarkable and this is seen in the huge loss on productivity of the financial services sector . 
  not all of this drop is accounted for by the bubble . 
  also in the u.k. investment and retail branches of banks should be separate within the company . 
  the eu on the other hand has a kind of banking union in place with the ecb overseeing central banks - some of which ( i 'm looking at the bank of italy in particular ) were doing quite little in terms of oversight until now . 
  banking in europe has changed although they have n't implement your pet policy the way you 'd like . 
  and we can study in their free higher education system . 
  fair ? 
  ultimately , if * really * bothers you , you can look into education abroad . 
  there are places where you can get free university tuition in english ( including sweden , denmark and malta if you like the sun ) bypass student loans entirely . 
  it never hurts to broaden your horizons and experience living in different places . 
  he 's quite right about that . 
  the funny bit is countries like italy and spain borrowed at over 4.5 % to lend to greece at an interest rate of effectively < 1 % ( on their loans to greece ) . 
  i 've seen this too many times over the last few days , so i 'd really like to point out that it the adjective related to economy is *** economic *** . 
  economical means cheap/inexpensive , and is something quite different . 
  an `` economical newspaper '' would be pretty cheap - i suppose at $ 2.90 it 's not too bad , but i do n't think that was the point . 
   you could flash a few hundreds and the girls would look at you differently . 
  ** now they snicker ** ...  i was 16 . suggests you were 16 the most recent time you did it . 
  i was being cheeky . 
  that means ... you were flashing francs and drachmas * as an embryo * ? 
  except that for greece interest rates were cut along with extension of loan maturities . 
  this resulted in savings of some $ 50b over 35 years according some german-sounding chap on the radio . 
  that was n't an ad hominem . 
  it was a metaphor . 
  yeah , but if i want to fly , jumping off a building is n't going to help no matter how much i want it to . 
  the difference is the ec existed when algeria became independent  otherwise , i suppose it 's the us ' loss . 
  think of all the paid healthcare , sick leave and maternity leave they could have had !, 
  algeria was considered part of france - if my history serves it was fairly well integrated and not some random colony . 
  the algerian war of independence ended in 1962 ( ? 
  ) , separating it from france . 
  i believe it was part of the ec until then . 
  fair enough !, 
  my original point is that it was part of the eu as part of denmark and the left by popular vote . 
  it 's the only territory to do this so far . 
  op seems to have forgotten this wrinkle in eu history . 
  it 's part of denmark !, 
  greenland is a self-governing part of denmark . 
  it left the community while remaining part of denmark in the 80s . 
  i suppose if you wanted to stretch it , algeria left a predecessor to the eu too , but that was a little different . 
  actually greenland left the eu !, 
  not an entire country but certainly a huge landmass with inhabitants ( although not very many ) . 
  oh yeah , definitely . 
  he * could * sort it all out in 24 hours !, 
   the propaganda from both sides implies as much . 
  but that 's my point !, 
  you ca n't have a serious , honest referendum on implications !, 
  i 'd consider myself to have an above average knowledge of the situation ( i read about this more than i should ) and i could n't possibly tell you what the hell the outcome of either vote would be . 
  if i were greek i 'd probably vote `` yes '' because tsipras says `` no '' and i do n't like him , but that 's not grounds on which to decide the future of a nation !, 
  the real problem is that if they wanted a referendum they would have to have behaved differently from the start and announced their intention to hold one a couple of months ago at least . 
  then they could *** actually *** publish a final proposal and people would know what they are voting for . 
  today , the people voting `` yes '' and voting for nothing . 
  there is no deal . 
  i 'm not sure you understand the difference between extending the bailout or negotiating a new one . 
  under the old agreement , you only needed approval in a handful of parliaments and if the proposal was acceptable to the german bundestag , it would 've probably gone through the others . 
  with a new bailout , all 18 other ez member parliaments will have to vote .
