  that narrows the concessions that the various heads of government can make while appeasing their parliaments and their electorates . 
  this means that the old agreement is completely off the table and they may not get an offer as good as that in the next lot of negotiations - they 'll need to start completely from scratch . 
  on a related note , how do you think muscat will fare if the opposition decide to attack him for wasting taxpayer 's money when malta itself floats in and out of excessive deficit procedures and has a rising debt load ? 
  honestly curious here , as i have no feel for the political situation in malta . 
  it 's going to be difficult to get a deal past many parliaments , including germany , slovakia , finland and the netherlands . 
  you ca n't take it for granted that electorates in the baltics ( and consequently their parliaments ) will support a new deal either . 
  the reason we all should is that these people are essentially stateless . 
  they ca n't go back home , because it 's too dangerous for them and they need a new home . 
  though an imperfect system they ask for asylum in europe . 
  they 're already here so fixing the system is something to discuss for the future , but these people are here . 
  we 've lumbered italy with a legal framework for how it needs to deal with these migrants and consequently italy ca n't do what it pleases . 
  it stands to reason that if we want to uphold human rights then we need to help italy . 
  it 's hardly fair to care about human rights so long as italy is the only country to uphold them . 
  if we do n't help italy uphold the rules we make then , i believe we lose the moral right to ensure they follow them . 
  so frankly if they just gave them all a schengen visa i do n't see how it would be justified for anyone to complain . 
  we do n't want that now , do we ? 
  but the government is n't asking that are they ? 
  but they say the referendum has nothing to do with leaving the euro !, 
  i 'm on my phone so i 'll give you a source for the law thing later . 
  yes actually . 
  they should 've said no alone and took responsibility . 
  that 's what they were elected for and their mandate allowed that . 
  what they really should have done though is set a deadline by which is no agreement was reached , a referendum would be . 
  that way everyone would know about it a couple of months ahead and could be informed by the time the referendum came about . 
  it would also mean the creditors are treated more fairly because they could shape their offer to meet the referendum . 
  the last proposal was made during the week and is n't the one the referendum is about . 
  also that offer is n't on the table so it can not be accepted . 
  in any case the economic damage over the past week is bound to make that proposal irrelevant , so it would n't make sense to adopt it now , would it ? 
  how on earth can the question in a referendum be immaterial ? 
  if you 're expected to answer something that 's not the question that just adds to the ambiguity . 
  that means the electorate can not make an informed decision because they do n't know what to be informed about and what the answers mean . 
  your reply only confirms what a travesty this referendum is . 
  of course their is risk to the european project but that 's a different topic from the legitimacy of this vote . 
  that 's a cop out and you know it . 
  first of all , this referendum is a fraud - the question asks people to accept an offer that does n't exist ( and that after the carnage of this week is probably inadequate anyway ) . 
  secondly , a fair outcome is only possible if the electorate are well-informed . 
  this is not possible if the questions and its implications are not clear . 
  in any case , issue is immensely complex and voting ` no ' involves navigating completely uncharted waters . 
  to make things worse , the greek people have had a week to decide . 
  to compound even this , the situation has arisen because the government forced through legislation ( directly not even through parliament ) that changes important aspects of referendum law . 
  the perversion of democracy in this instance is utterly grotesque . 
  in the uk , deposits are only guaranteed up to # 80,000 . 
  if your bank goes bust , anything above that can be lost . 
  in cyprus , deposits went to stabilise the bank of cyprus . 
  of course , you probably should n't just be sitting on that much money in the bank , but that 's a different matter altogether . 
  the situation was quite different . 
  cyprus suffered from the financial crisis , then a couple of unfortunate events ( gas explosion ) , then the bank of cyprus lost lots of money invested in greece . 
  the state needed a bailout as a result . 
  reforms were necessary to correct , but cyprus ' economy is different and suffered differently . 
  its starting point was n't as bad as greece 's . 
  capital controls in cyprus are more lax ( withdrawal limited were never as low as $ 60 ) and bailout was quite small , because it 's a small country . 
   in the order of 50 % unless they promise to cover inflation as well , you 'd probably lose money . 
   arguably yes , but it 's hard to square their position domestically with what the epp stands for . 
  it was hard to square the position with david davies ' supporters - and cameron needed them to win . 
  that 's why he promised them he 'd leave the epp . 
  being in the pes does n't really hurt labour ( except of course in the eu election when they asked schulz not to come , because they wanted to keep the eu stuff out of it ) . 
  however , i take your point regarding politics in ni . 
  regarding the epp there still is n't much they can do if there is n't a party here that will affiliate with them . 
  it certainly does n't mean there are n't centre-right europhiles in the uk though . 
  we have the biggest debate on reforming the eu coming up , with pretty much everyone wanting some kind of change , and the tories ca n't influence the epp . 
  far better to stay in an influential group and try to affect change from within it than to sit alone on the sidelines . 
   same result though , literally no-one in the uk could vote for junker or the epp ( and i think the uk was not alone in that . . ) which sort of makes any notion of representation in the presidency a bit of a joke . . ni voters can not vote for the main uk parties . 
  ( i really do wonder if i 'm walking into this ... ) does that make representative democracy in the uk a joke ? 
  incidentally , of course , the situation with juncker was unfortunate . 
  i 'd have quite liked to vote for the epp , but was robbed of this opportunity because of the conservatives ' silly infighting over europe . 
  you 'd have thought they 'd have got their shit together since major ... 
  it 's pointless . 
  the majority of people appear strongly against giving greece more of their hardearned money , so an opposition party would just look out of touch . 
  the snp can afford to play this because it plays to their narrative of `` heartless tories '' in scotland . 
  it wo n't win them many favours in england - but they do n't care about that . 
  everyone who voted for parties affiliated to the epp in the last eu elections . 
  the epp won a relative majority and is the largest party in the ep , so the put forward juncker as president of the commission . 
   are n't the ** majority ** of the eu citizens against syriza getting away with it 's demands die linke got 8.6 % of the national vote , so they most certainly do n't speak for everybody in europe . 
  at this point , frankly , i would be surprised if anyone feels that they can trust and work with tsipras . 
  the man 's erratic , manipulative and seems to lack basic decency . 
  if he loves greece he should step aside and let someone more competent stand in . 
  he 's struggling to get sympathy on reddit , where the demographic is largely young/centre-left . 
  what do you think that says about his wider appeal ? 
  yeah ... that scotland impartiality thing was overplayed by the nationalists . 
  you always feel neutral sources are against you - that 's what makes them neutral . 
  as a ` no ' voter , i was also pretty annoyed at the bbc , but we won , so i got over it quite quickly . 
  i was much less annoyed with the coverage in the ft and economist ... 
  actually german economists tend to be ordoliberal . 
  which makes sense since neoliberal anglo-saxon economies want to deal with greece differently ( make everything go away quickly , even by paying off greece so that it stabilizes markets ), 
  it 's a shame the german finance ministry does n't have any economists in it . 
  but krugman said no . 
  oops . 
  even though i know it , i ca n't make myself say nai = yes :d, 
  it 's not helped by the fact that ~ ~ nai ~ ~ \u03bf\u03c7\u03b9 / no is above ~ ~ \u03bf\u03c7\u03b9 ~ ~ nai/yes . 
  incidentally , [ this bbc article has other odd referendum ballot sheets ( clearly tsipras is not in good company ) ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33311422 ) . 
  edit : oops . 
  they can promise the repairman that he can keep all the drachmas he finds in the money-printer 's paper jam . 
  that way everyone 's happy . 
  it 's ok , because they can print more drachmas to pay for the printing of drachmas with more drachmas . 
  well ... til . 
  here ( obviously ) we tend to use surnames . 
  if i came across an article where cameron was referred to as david , i 'd assume they were being contemptuous :d, 
  i think the hellenic republic has found the only font worse that both comic sans and papyrus ** combined ** . 
  [ i 'm hoping to find out what it is ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/identifythisfont/comments/3bo54d/you_knew_this_was_coming_what_font_did_greece_use/ ) , you know , for science . 
  you are now the one with most to lose if greece does not default .
