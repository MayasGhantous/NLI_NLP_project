  there 's clearly two fonts in the body of the letter . 
  they must have used ** tw ** o typewr ** it ** ^ ers . 
  there are various mechanisms for transfers depending on regional wealth through things like the eu regional development fund and money directed to countries that meet objective 1 status and the like . 
  is it a thing in ireland to refer to your head of government by his first name ? 
  or is the author just on first name terms with him ? 
  he probably wo n't even send out the postcards . 
  greece * had * a primary surplus . 
  i 'm not so convinced that 's the case any more . 
  it 's just the telegraph , but to be fair to them , they 've been saying something like this would happen for as long as i can remember ( about 15 years ) . 
  i do n't like it , but they going to gloat a bit . 
   blame your government for accepting to bailout ~ ~ some private banks ~ ~ the greek government ...  of course , the goverment lost during next electrions . 
  it would seem they did blame their government . 
  few points : * reducing exposure to toxic greek assets could have been achieved in other ways - such as by directly bailing out banks . 
  * there 's also that fact that banks exposed to greek debt did indeed suffer big losses when greece 's debt was slashed . 
  losses were substantial enough that were one of the reasons that the bank of cyprus collapsed - bringing a country to its knees . 
  * because of low interest rates and long debt maturity , greece spends less on servicing debt that italy . 
  do you think italy should default ? 
  * should italy and portugal borrow money at 2.38 % and 3.02 % respectively to lend it greece at < 1 % ? 
  and then not see any of it ? 
  this money is n't smoke and mirrors - it can be used on other things : why not spend it on paying down portuguese debt ? 
  or improving infrastructure in southern italy ( where youth unemployment is about 60 % and they could use the jobs ) ? 
  that 's because german ordoliberalism is a different outlook to anything in our anglo-saxon part of the world . 
  from our standpoint , the situation is a little insane too . 
  however , it is , worth noting that although the us has a more integrated fiscal set up , as a matter of policy it still does not bail out failing states . 
   podemos would easily win the spanish general election in december if this were to happen , for example . 
  i think you seriously underestimate the difficulties facing greece and her people . 
  nothing anyone can do will make anything better by the end of the year . 
  in fact , no matter the outcome , we can expect the situation to deteriorate between now and december . 
  if we 're all lucky the situation wo n't turn into a humanitarian disaster . 
  but on a side note , i wish i shared your bubbly optimism . 
  am i supposed to be impressed by the big number ? 
  greece 's debt repayments are lower as a percentage of gdp than the uk or italy ( and far less than japan ) . 
  if these countries can afford them , so can greece . 
  the trick is in the effective interest rates and in the debt maturity . 
  the interest on greek debt is essentially 0.9 % if you consider that interest on ecb and eu loans is given back to the greek government and the debt matures in 35 years . 
  even if you think of it in household terms - a normal mortgage is far less affordable than greek debt . 
  of course , the dynamics are different : greece has the potential to grow its tax base over 35 years more than an individual can grow their income . 
  i notice you missed out hms duncan ... 
  turns out the catapult was really fucking expensive . 
  ... yeah ... 
  i do n't really know how that works either . 
  obviously the reforms are unpleasant and do hit relatively hard . 
  the problem is that whereas most countries have funded their welfare state with increasing productivity and then perhaps borrowing a bit , greece funded a lot of it through borrowing . 
  as if that 's not enough , the greek government has lost a lot of it income from taxation because of the smaller economy . 
  the truth is it could never afford its government expenditure , but this inflated its gdp , so since the borrowing was withdrawn , the system crumbled . 
  the crux of the problem is that greece ca n't afford to spend as much as it does . 
  it also ca n't borrow alone , so needs other states to borrow for it ( e.g. 
  you borrow money from the bank to give it to your brother who has a bad credit rating and ca n't do it himself ) . 
  greece needs to find a new way to work itself out of economic ruin . 
  some policies to do this are just counterintuitive : if you make it impossible to fire people in a job , then no one is going to hire people in an economic crisis and so , unemployment stays high . 
  therefore making it easy to fire people , makes it easy to hire them in these uncertain times . 
  other policies are just unpleasant : greece spends more on pensions as a proportion of gdp than most countries . 
  however you look at this , this needs to be sorted . 
  most countries have undergone significant pension reform , when their systems were under less stress . 
  the result is that greece * has * dragged its feet on a number of reforms , because they are politically difficult . 
  the fact that greece 's gdp has declined , of course , related to government spending , but is a secondary thing . 
  it could n't be sustained without sustaining government expenditure , but government spending was boosted by borrowing and never by generating `` real '' wealth . 
  as a result , the borrowing was unsustainable , and so , no one was willing to foot the bill for greece . 
  in practice , the cuts resulted in a steeper drop in gdp than expected , but ultimately the idea is to provide greece with a sustainable government and a foundation for growth . 
  those last objectives were being met . 
  edit : deleted a random extra word . 
  basically greece 's government spends a lot more than it earns . 
  if greece does n't cut its expenditure we need to give it a lot of money to make up the shortfall . 
  if greece cuts its expenditure we need less money to bridge the gap . 
  once the greek government is solvent , has more sensible expenses , a more modern labour market and has figured out how to collect tax , the foundations will be there for a solid recovery . 
  well , democracy needs to be respected in all countries . 
  so the greek demand , means an extension to the bailout . 
  this needs to approved in a handful of eu national parliaments - among them germany . 
  if the bailout expires before an extension is reached , then it is approval for a new deal is needed is all counties ' parliaments . 
  if tsipras wanted a referendum in good faith he 'd have set the deadline earlier . 
  at least that way the greek people would have time to get informed about the eurogroup proposal . 
   i would rather have a couple of years of economic collapse and then maybe a chance of good recovery that 's delusional . 
  the disaster at hand will scar greece for decades . 
  they did n't under new democracy when things were going almost according to plan . 
  now that shit has hit the fan , it 's looking even less rosy . 
  default is n't a short term thing . 
  it can take decades to recover from . 
  argentina is often looked at a something of a relative success after its default in 2005 . 
  in absolute terms , it 's not doing too great . 
  * and * argentina could borrow in ny bond markets in the meantime - an option i doubt would be open to greece . 
  monetary policy is a tool , not the be-all and end-all of economic success . 
  even if they 're given an opportunity to start from scratch , the underlying problems are all still there . 
  using the drachma will not help greece unless it reforms . 
  my main concern in the setting of a default is the welfare of the greek people . 
  of course , if you have inflation of 200 % , the value of pensions is decimated by more than what the imf want , and is going to result in far more hardship . 
  i really doubt that china will spend the huge amounts of money needed to keep greece afloat at the cost of antagonising its major trading partners and gaining nothing itself . 
  i do n't understand why some people think there is a long line of creditors ready to give greece loads of free money . 
   he is a very honest politician he lied about what was possible and what he could achieve . 
  he used this deceit to convince a suffering populace to vote him into power . 
  the problem is if greece defaults , the ecb ca n't support their banks or government . 
  they also would be even less likely to get more loans . 
  that means the government wo n't have money to pay its employee , welfare recipients and pensioners . 
  if that happens they have 2 options . 
  either not pay anyone or pay in a new currency . 
  the latter would push them out of the euro zone . 
   so europe and the imf forced greece to take the money so the european banks would n't collapse , taking all the economy with them . 
  there will have been other ways of handling the issue , such as bailing out banks directly ( as indeed countries like spain and cyprus had to do ) . 
  making the money go through greece and arranging a debt haircut helped greece by saving it from default . 
   so to say , greece was already sick , but the banks were the enablers of its sickness .
