  western european associations * could * sustain an entire football ecosystem . 
  more interestingly still , it could hoover up all global talent and deprive fifa-affiliated institutions of it . 
  you could offer players like messi ( who has spanish citizenship ) the opportunity to play for spain in the euros . 
  in this new world , argentina would n't be a consideration , because it exists is a sort of parallel football reality . 
  you could rope in a few like-minded associations , like the us , canada and australia too . 
  i would n't be upset if it played out this way . 
  a boycott would mean not going . 
  not participating does n't involve a huge amount of preparation in and of itself , but presumably they need to discuss contingencies like what happens if fifa bans countries that boycott 2018 from future world cups . 
  you would n't organise a competing tournament - it would be a very bold move because if it does n't attract more viewership than the world cup , you look stupid . 
  you do n't really need a unanimous decision between 54 associations . 
  if england , germany , italy , spain and france want to pull out that would be huge and turn 2018 into a second rate tournament . 
  between them , these countries have won 11 titles in the 20 editions of the tournament ( 5 of the 7 since 1990 ) and of the remaining 9 , brazil won 5 , and argentina and uruguay won 2 each . 
  if england , germany , italy , spain and france did want to pull out , they would , of course get support from other countries . 
  i can imagine the netherlands , belgium , denmark , sweden and norway joining in ( they 're not terrible huge fans of corruption ) . 
  such a deterioration in the situation may well force uefas hand as it may lead to a schism . 
  although we like to point out uefa is where the money is , it 's only half true . 
  most of the money is in western europe . 
  good god man , are you trying to start a war ? 
  you be calling scots british next ( lpt : in this case , technically correct is ** not ** the best kind of correct ), 
  many people alive today in commonwealth countries were born in under british rule and so were born as british subjects . 
  if they 're not british citizens today it 's because they chose their new nationality when their country became independent ( if they did n't they 'd need visas to stay there ) . 
  it 's not some distant thing - this wound down gradually within the last 60 years or so . 
  that 's in addition to farmers that were concerned about loss of crops . 
  the difficulty is that banks at the time were looking wobbly . 
  you could n't let them fail , because credit would dry up more , investment would fall more and we 'd all be even more screwed . 
  if they needed bailed out that would fall on the government , which may have led them to bankrupcy - like cyprus . 
  spain was teetering on the edge at the time and was stretched to the limit . 
  the sensible outcome as a result was to let creditors lose * some * money ( because they made the bad investment after all ) , but for states to help out to stem the contagion . 
  today the banking system in the eu is safer and similar problems are less likely to arise . 
  you 're of course ignoring the fact that private banks took a large haircut on greek debt and sustained huge losses as a result . 
  one of the reasons cyprus tanked was the exposure of its banks to greek debt that had to be written off . 
  then the government had to step in , but because of the way things panned out , they did n't have enough cash to cover the shortfall . 
  the headline rate of 175 % does n't enter into it . 
  most of that debt is at * very * low interest rates ( < 1 % ) and is payable over 35 years , with the ecb giving interest payments back to greece on its share of the debt in the first few years . 
  these repayment terms are really quite generous - so much so that greece spends less on interest than countries like italy ( which borrowed money at higher interest rates than what it lends to greece ) . 
  also , once economic growth returns , the headline figure will collapse and it wo n't remain 175 % . 
  the number that matters is the interest rates stipulated in the repayment plan . 
  the idea that greece can simply * take * money from poorer countries like , say , malta and not pay it back is laughable and they are perfectly within their rights to not want to give any . 
  it 's not moralising : you want money from someone , you take it on their terms , more so when those terms are exceedingly generous . 
   imo we should have a levy on tv for public service broadcasts out of interest , how would this work ? 
  i meant per household/account/whatever - with a worldwide operation , i 'm sure netfix expenses are more than the bbc , but netflix benefits from an economy of scale . 
  what i mean is the licence fee costs me # 145 per annum when netflix costs me # 84 per annum ( i can pay # 72 if i do n't mind sd and 1 device at a time ) . 
  the bbc world service is relatively cheap ( all of radio is a fraction of the expense compared to tv ) . 
  my other point is that the licence fee needs a rethink . 
  in what world does it make sense that i can watch iplayer for free ( without paying the licence fee ) , but i need to pay it to watch sky sports ? 
  if i give up live sport ( which , apart from wimbledon , i almost never watch on the bbc ) , i could legally enjoy all the same bbc offerings i do now without paying the licence fee . 
  how is that fair ? 
  the bbc is more expensive than netflix . 
  a standard netflix subscription ( not the cheapest one ) is # 6.99 - that 's # 84 per year . 
  the bbc licence is # 145 . 
  for much less , netflix are releasing many high quality tv series like daredevil , better call saul , house of cards and orange is the new black . 
  i personally enjoy lillyhammer too - i do n't know why . 
  it 's also a bizarre fee because i can watch iplayer without paying the licence fee . 
  in fact i pay it only to watch live sport on nowtv . 
  so i only pay the bbc actually to watch its competitor . 
  the present set of loans are over 35 years and have an interest of < 1 % . 
  ecb loans are arranged so that interest payments on the capital amount are sent back to greece . 
  it 's not a coincidence that greece spends far less on interest payments than countries like italy and the uk . 
   toughest shit on earth really ? 
  i suppose the old lada 's were pretty tough but do you have any examples ? 
  you have military parades in * france * ? 
  wtf ? 
  thanks for the correction . 
  i think i heard the combing in the context for actual support for the languages . 
  like here we get bbc alba in gaelic - does rai transmit in local languages ? 
  yeah , but not as an official italian language . 
  here , where the government promotes gaelic , we get gaelic translations of things and bbc alba ( in gaelic ) . 
  the rugby on it is hilarious . 
  since almost no one who does n't live on an island speaks gaelic fluently , the commentators keep having to speak to the pundits in english . 
  that 's despite the fact that * no one * in scotland speaks gaelic and not english . 
  there are even gaelic translations for train station names in areas that have n't spoken gaelic for hundreds of years if ever . 
  that said i 'm not too sure about the trentino-alto adige ( s\u00fcdtirol ) region and if that has any specific legislation since it 's a little more autonomous . 
  given your flair , you may know a little more about it than me . 
  -- edit : minor point - `` is recognising '' is in the present continuous tense and we use that for things that are happening literally right now . 
  so your sentence says that the italian government is * starting * to recognise german as an official language as we speak ( e.g. 
  is they 're in the process of passing a law ) . 
  the correct tense to use would be the present simple which we use to talk about habitual things ( ** `` italy recognises the german language '' ** ) , scheduled things ( `` i go to work every day '' ) and stories . 
  the one thing we do n't use it for is talking about the present ( lol ) - so erm ... the tense of a verb \u2260 the time the action happens in . 
  obviously , this is n't terribly important because what matters is getting yourself understood - which you did . 
  as far as i know , italy does n't recognise any languages other than italian ( of the tuscan variety ) . 
  otherwise you 've got about 6-7 million venetian speakers , almost 6 million neapolitan speakers and about 2.5 million lombard speakers . 
  to do the maths - that 's about 15.5 ( more than galician , basque and catalan ) . 
  yet , these regions do n't kick up as much of a fuss . 
  why ? 
  because language here is being used as a tool to promote a divisive nationalism . 
  language is there to unite and not split and i abhor the abuse of language in this way . 
  incidentally , i think france adopts a similar stance to languages that are n't french . 
  with all our pro-eu wanking up here , you 'd hope the snp would actually come out as pro-eu if it mattered . 
  it would sure as hell look bad if they voted with ukip on the eu , and came out as more europsceptic than the tories . 
  i have a very poor impression of the snp ( apart from abolishing tolls on the bridges , i 'm not sure they 've ever done anything i agree with ) , but in this regard , you , sir , surpass even me . 
  cities skylines definitely looks good !, 
  that 's some money if gladly send finland 's way !, 
  nokia sold off their phone making division to microsoft so although they made great phones , they do n't make any anymore :( it was a funny story - they appointed this microsoft guy as ceo . 
  at the time a few people had thought it was dodgy and that he would tank the company and sell it to microsoft at a cheap price . 
  i thought these people were `` tinfoil hat-crazy '' conspiracy theorists . 
  but then that 's exactly how it panned out . 
  now i do n't know what to believe . 
  but you do n't make good phones any more :( what am i supposed to do ? 
  set up my own mobile network provider out of nokia equipment on tall wooden towers ? 
  to be fair , there 's room to improve standards on both sides of the atlantic ... unless you like undocumented horse meat in your beef .
