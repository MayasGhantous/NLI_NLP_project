  i 'm sitting in an air b&b in barcelona right now , waiting to move into the new flat which we found a week ago . 
  i might not count , since i * am * a british citizen , but since i currently reside in spain , i 'll just post the ones i did . 
  [ theresa may telling the eu ] ( http://imgur.com/btj2c1c ) what she wants the new relationship to be . 
  and a more [ general statement ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vsftynb.jpg ) of her policy positions on brexit . 
  shop on amazon.co.uk for electrical goods the day after may invokes article 50 . 
  you 'll get a shitload of bargains . 
  http://filmon.com is your friend . 
  live streaming of free-to-air channels , including bbc1 . 
  featuring peter cook , who founded private eye , whose editor is a team captain on hignfy . 
  its satire all the way down . 
  i was born in england but have family in scotland - so went there often . 
  we used to holiday in wales every year , but i have ever been to northern ireland . 
  when we used to go to wales ( the 1980s ) , we knew a farming family whose grandfather did not speak any english at all - only welsh . 
  he had never gone to england . 
  i doubt he had ever gone to a city of any sort , anywhere . 
  my wife just got a job here in barcelona , which involves speaking german . 
  there are similar jobs for english speakers . 
  many employers offer free lessons in spanish and catalan ( and my wife 's employers do indeed offer this ) . 
  day to day life would be * possible * without spanish but very difficult , and you 'd meet lots of blocks at banks and other places . 
  you can get by with just english in many places in mallorca ( santa ponsa , magaluf , palma ) , because there are so many tourists and ex-pats that businesses always hire english and german speakers . 
   we excel in the sports that they have invented you could just have said : `` we are not british '' . 
  that covers the same ground , more or less . 
  warwick castle in the uk is the best-preserved castle of its type and they put on [ jousting tournaments ] ( https://www.warwick-castle.com/explore/daily-shows-and-activities.aspx ) there in summer . 
  a bit out of the way , but [ bede 's world ] ( http://www.bedesworld.co.uk/ ) near jarrow recreates a 9th century british village ( complete with animals ) . 
  it 's a small exhibition and hard to get to , but worth it if you 're in the area . 
  not too far away in wallsend , they have a [ reconstructed roman fort ] ( https://segedunumromanfort.org.uk/ ) . 
  `` wallsend '' is so named because it is the end of hadrian 's wall , and there are lots of museums and ruins to the west of there . 
  but if you can go anywhere in europe , and imperial rome is your period , then [ pompeii is a must-see ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pompeii ) and you ca n't swing a cat in italy without bashing at least three ancient monuments . 
  rome itself is glorious to behold . 
  i made that into [ a thing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hidnuzg.jpg ), 
  under uk law , if anything goes wrong with a product , the credit card company have to refund you if the vendor wo n't . 
  any nonsense from a vendor and you just phone the card company . 
  the benefits of a credit card are massive ; but to be fair , these are funded by the high interest rates which some people are silly enough to pay when they do n't make sure their balance is zero at the end of the month . 
  and we 've all forgotten from time to time and seen the interest go on the bill . 
  yeah . 
  my ( german ) wife is horrified by the thought of getting a mortgage . 
  she wo n't hear of it . 
  i 've explained that it 's cheaper than rent and you get to own the house after 25 years . 
  but she wo n't have it . 
  i could n't even sway her with all the insurance options that you can get to make it cast iron safe . 
  `` if there 's insurance available for it , then the risk is unacceptable and we just should n't do the thing , '' said no german ever . 
  except when talking about mortgages . 
  is it not a refundable deposit ? 
  and may is like : `` i mean , we can still be friends , right ? 
  and snuggle ? 
  and have all the sex we want , with all those positions we demanded and that you contorted into ? 
  right ? 
  but you ca n't have your friends over any more because this is my flat now , not ours . 
  because we 've split up . 
  you may appreciate [ hoff the record ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfdhyjscr7m ) the hoff does , at least , [ have a sense of humour ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htwhypplnws ) . 
  yeah . 
  extending the music career of david hasselhoff was pretty bad , you guys . 
  and some of them are already obsessively wearing said grubby garment with huge pride , alas . 
  thanks for highlighting that . 
  to be clear , i do n't mean office supplies or little stuff . 
  i mean things like trains and tanks and enough tarmac to create a new motorway . 
  the nhs can also negotiate better prices on artificial hip joints and medicines when committing to a minimum spend . 
  it does n't have to stock everything centrally as long as the sum of the orders from all hospitals meets the minimum . 
  these sorts of economies of scale make sense . 
  paperclips do not : it just results in paperclip burocracy . 
  they * did * [ elect a monkey ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1965569.stm ) to be mayor , though . 
  i lived ( briefly ) in hartlepool . 
  it is a very , very odd place . 
  i was not at all surprised when they elected h'angus . 
  i am not entirely surprised that their wee experiment in democracy resulted in failure , either . 
  ** edit ** just because it 's fun to tell , i shall add the story of why hartlepool fc have a monkey as a mascot . 
  legend has it that , during the napoleonic wars , a french ship was wrecked . 
  the sole survivor was a monkey , dressed up in french uniform . 
  the good people of hartlepool did their civic duty at once . 
  they put the monkey on trial for being a french spy , found it guilty , and hung it . 
  this tale has been used ever since to illustrate the stupidity of people from hartlepool . 
  but , the way hartlepudlians tell it is a little different . 
  as my friend explained it to me : `` the law of salvage means you can take anything from a shipwreck . 
  as long as there are no survivors . 
  the monkey was a survivor . 
  the law does n't specify the * species * of survivor . 
  it had to die , and die all legal , like . 
  we 're * not * fucking stupid . 
  we are murdering , thieving bastards . '', 
  for national infrastructure like healthcare , big roads , railways , education etc i want centralised control . 
  one policy , one huge budget with massive bargaining power for cheaper deals . 
  for stuff which varies between regions , local government . 
  rubbish collection , laying water pipes , repairing small local roads , etc. 
  even policing falls into that category . 
  this is much the system that we do have in the uk , except that railways are private . 
  the drawback is that the centralised government can * really * mess things up , as the tories are doing now , to the nhs . 
  very important , this . 
  i do n't remember when american express was last widely accepted . 
  note that credit cards can charge for foreign transactions . 
  mine charges 2 % but my debit card charges only 1 % . 
  it might be worth picking up some currency before you fly ( from a bank , not at the airport ) . 
  traveller 's cheques too ( if they still exist ) . 
  yes . 
  and airb & b is also good . 
  and cheaper . 
  and you might meet locals . 
  dutch is soft compared to german , 
  sometimes . 
  my wife is german and we play `` spot the german '' when out and about . 
  i 'm sure we miss some but the fashion and the way they walk can be quite distinctive .
