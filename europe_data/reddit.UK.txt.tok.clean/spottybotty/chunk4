  some brits are equally obvious . 
  i was once in greece with my mother . 
  we were trying to work out which language the young ladies next to us were talking . 
  we were certain it was eastern european but could n't place it . 
  far too harsh for dutch , not german . 
  certainly was n't polish . 
  then i caught a word . 
  they were from ~ ~ yorkshire ~ ~ newcastle . 
  so ... no , we ca n't always tell that they 're speaking the same bloody language as us . 
  it is viewed with huge concern . 
  the threat of ttip was used as a `` leave '' argument in the brexit vote . 
  those who do n't understand how negotiations work think it 's secret and menacing . 
  those who know how negotiations work know that the eu can not possibly agree to it in its current form . 
  ironically , now the uk is leaving the eu , we can only dream of getting a deal as good as ttip . 
  trump is also openly racist , sexist , and islamaphobic . 
  any politician who seems to even like him is going to take a personal hit . 
  it would be fascinating to see how it got dealt with . 
  this is already happening in places . 
  i keep up in / r/enoughtrumpspam, 
  the `` west '' was the other side to the `` east '' in the cold war . 
  hence australia and south africa are in the `` west '' . 
  so is south korea . 
  but north korea is in the `` east '' . 
  unallied countries were the `` third world '' . 
  while each group do share ( by and large ) some characteristics , it was their political stance which was the only common factor . 
  after the cold war , the terms blurred a great deal . 
  i 'm not sure that there is an agreed definition for `` the west '' any more . 
  there is no more `` eastern bloc '' . 
  and `` third world '' seems to now mean poorer nations . 
  not at all . 
  in mallorca there are english-speaking builders , doctors , accountants . . pretty much everything that is needed to support a community of about 16,000 british people . 
  gibraltar is * entirely * english-speaking , of course . 
  the east and south of spain have about 150,000 british people living there , and they have a huge demand for english-speaking services . 
  it * helps * to speak spanish . 
  but it is absolutely not essential , if you only target english-speaking employers . 
  of course * many * of the english-speaking jobs in mallorca are seasonal tourist jobs , but there are enough people there to support most services you 'd find in any small british town . 
  the same goes for german-speakers too . 
  my mother-in-law has lived on the island for 17 years and never learned any spanish . 
  there are many similar british residents . 
  it is quite possible to get a job and then learn spanish as you go - though such jobs are in very high demand . 
  my wife was offered just such a job a couple of months ago ( call centre work for a travel firm ) ; but we decided that we did n't want to stay on mallorca . 
  we did n't see any good reasons being advocated , though . 
  the leave campaign kept talking about immigration and turkish membership as two of the main factors . 
  not everyone who voted to leave is a xenophobe , but it played a huge role in the campaign . 
  / r/brexit is an odd place . 
  it seems to have little activity and some threads are purely remainers and others appear to be pure leavers . 
  many posts are to opinion pieces or blog posts . 
  i mod / r/brealism , which was created just after the vote because there was nothing for sensible , fact-based discussion . 
  the white rose and groups like that ? 
  the plots to assassinate as well , i guess . 
  what of opposition under kaiser wilhelm ? 
  also large parts of spain , and gibraltar have big english-speaking communities . 
  many people there have never learned spanish . 
  there are many such places in london . 
  manchester has a few fetish/specialist clubs and events too . 
  most big cities will have one or two , i think . 
  if you 're not in a city , then i guess it 's [ fetlife ] ( https://fetlife.com ) if you want to meet people with similar interests . 
  london has a [ lot of events ] ( http://www.londonfetishscene.com/index.php?cmd=mktcalendar ) , though . 
  pretty much any of them , as i recall . 
  one had to arrive in costume ( any sort of costume as long as it was fetish ) . 
  one guy was walking around wearing just a pair of [ cowboy chaps ] ( http://www.leather4sure.com/design/pimg/i49b3d2e65bdb459c6e3a2eca2970cfec.jpg ) . 
  i instantly dubbed him `` tripod '' because that cock was fucking massive . 
  there was a wooden cross which people could be tied to . 
  i saw one lady being whipped by her partner . 
  there was a curtained off area which you could only go into if you wanted to have sex . 
  i did n't go in because i had nobody to go in with ( and singles were not allowed in by themselves ) . 
  it was a [ torture garden ] ( http://torturegarden.com/gallery ) ( nsfw ) night iirc . 
  i think that [ this was the venue ] ( http://www.urban75.org/blog/brixton-mass-and-babalou-nightclubs-closed-premises-repossessed/ ) ( sfw ) . 
  bet that you lot do n't act as spoiled as us , though . 
  we just threw our toys out of the pram completely . 
  we have many such places in the uk . 
  last month i ate in a pizza place which was a converted church . 
  in london i went to a fetish club which had once been a church . 
  my friends live in a flat in one . 
  very oddly shaped rooms but lovely . 
  well ... a * little * adultery . 
  every now and then . 
  so i hear . 
  you 're welcome , 
  edinburgh is not as pricey as central london , but it 's expensive by scottish standards ( and british standards ) . 
  [ rightmove ] ( http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-to-rent/edinburgh/2-bed-flats.html ) is the best site to check for properties in the uk . 
  a brief glimpse shows me that a 2-bed flat in central edinburgh can be rented for about # 1,000 per month . 
  which is very cheap by london standards . 
  you can get cheaper rents further out , of course . 
  they have a mobile application too . 
  if you like an area you are in , fire it up and ask to see properties near to you right now . 
  that 's very handy for getting to know prices while you wander around the city . 
  the last place i lived in london was about 10 miles out of the centre ( london is * huge * - that was only zone 4 , and there are 6 zones ) , and i paid # 1,000 per month . 
  before that , a one-bed in central london would have cost me # 1,400 per month . 
  areas can be tricky in british cities , and edinburgh is no exception . 
  you want to make sure you have good bus services nearby , because that 's the main public transport ( there is no subway or metro here ) . 
  also , some areas can be very dodgy ( crime etc ) . 
  if a property looks cheap , there is a reason for that . 
  edinburgh has high crime compared to some other places in the uk , and it 'll be a lot worse in cheaper areas . 
  you will also find those areas to be much more likely to be homophobic . 
  you 'll almost certainly have no issues at all in nicer areas . 
  i 'd suggest renting an airb & b for a fortnight or a month , and looking around yourselves , so you can get to know the city . 
  as for accents , edinburgh has a very gentle accent . 
  a few words are different to english words , but you pick them up easily enough . 
  my german wife struggled when she arrived in the uk ( with * all * the regional accents - we have many ) but after a year she understood them all .
