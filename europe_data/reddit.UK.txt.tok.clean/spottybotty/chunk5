  no worries  the city may well suit you , if that 's how you feel . 
  the pavements are not all in good repair , though , so puddles in winter are to be expected ( i have a wheelchair and some pavements are too rough for me to go down in it ) . 
  glasgow is better in that regard . 
  snow will also be left where it is , i think . 
  roads get cleared , though . 
  i guess the other thing to note is scottish culture . 
  if you 're not used to high levels of sarcasm and irony , you might think that everyone is stupid and/or hates you . 
  in very few countries do best friends refer to each other as `` you cunt '' by way of affection . 
  it 's all in the tone of voice and context between `` best friends '' cunt and `` we are about to commence violence '' cunt . 
  i would recommend popping over to / r/edinburgh and having a lurk ( or even asking a question ) . 
  it 's a friendly sub - but , again , can be * heavy * on the irony . 
  the buses are quite good here ( aside from needing the exact money or a card which is awkward to put more money on ) . 
  the aurora can be seen , but i have n't been lucky enough to see it while i have been here ( a year ) . 
  it was big the other night , but we had 100 % cloud cover . 
  what else - oh yeah , rents are expensive in edinburgh , compared to other cities . 
  and landlords are a bit famous for being awful . 
  your experience may differ . 
  i am not renting , so i do n't have those issues : but i hear about them a lot , in / r/edinburgh . 
  i do n't know the gay scene here , but i would be amazed if there were any problems like prejudice etc. 
  it 's a very cosmopolitan city . 
  if people keep switching to english for me ( even the girl in the supermarket , last time i was there ) , i 'll be stuck in a monoligual hell which will be bad if i want to start working . 
  give me the german words i am obviously searching for , if you want to be nice . 
  but i will understand if you are in a hurry and thus need to switch to english . 
  offer to do work for somebody in exchange for payment . 
  begin to work . 
  you are now in business as a `` sole trader '' . 
  you 'll have to do your taxes etc at the end of the financial year , and look after your vat ( sales tax ) . 
  if you want more , a `` limited company '' protects you from any debts associated with the business . 
  the company can go bankrupt and you can walk away . 
  a ltd company can be set up in 5-10 minutes online . 
  you just need to pay a small fee and think of a unique company name . 
  [ the full process ] ( https://www.gov.uk/limited-company-formation/overview ) sounds a bit daunting , but it can all be automated because it 's so straightforward , and one template can basically be used for 99 % of cases - just fill in the company name , owner 's name and file it . 
  [ this company will do it all for # 10 ] ( https://www.1stformations.co.uk/ ) ( found randomly on google ) . 
  i * think * a limited company also needs its own bank account . 
  those carry small fees , sometimes , but are easy to set up once the business is registered . 
  a limited company requires a bit more book-keeping , but it 's not complex at all . 
  when i ran one , i paid an accountant to do it , but i had a big income and did n't want to risk getting in trouble . 
  especially because i was paying less tax than somebody with an equivalent gross salary ( it was into 6 figures so a salary would have been subject to 40 % tax * and * national insurance contributions ) . 
  it all had to be above board and professional with no errors whatsoever . 
  i was an employee of the company , and earned minimum wage . 
  the rest of the cash was kept by the company . 
  if i needed more money , i held a shareholder meeting and voted on whether or not to pay a dividend . 
  i was the only shareholder , so it was always agreed unanimously . 
  one paid less ( and fewer ) taxes on share dividends , and that is how i paid less tax overall . 
  this system is designed to encourage people to set up small businesses , essentially . 
  it needs to be quick , easy , and have an incentive . 
  ** edit ** spelling and clarity . 
  added bank account details . 
  i live in edinburgh . 
  it is beautiful , has much culture , and the people are friendly . 
  i 'm leaving because i ca n't stand it here . 
  the problem is the weather . 
  it does n't bother everyone , but i would urge you to give it a trial run * in winter * before settling . 
  the lack of daylight really bothers me . 
  in august this year we had maybe 7-10 days which were sunny . 
  that 's the best month of the year , weather-wise . 
  in january the sun rise about 10am and set about 4pm . 
  it was cloudy almost every day from january to june . 
  edinburgh is also expensive and quite small . 
  if the weather does n't bother you , then glasgow might be a better bet . 
  a little further south manchester is a huge gay city . 
  all sorts of lgbt events . 
  london is even better . 
  personally , i do not . 
  or coffee . 
  love the taste but it plays hell with the old waterworks . 
  i would if i could . 
  the country is literally named after rome , so it 's not all that surprising that there are cultural ties . 
  roman-like . 
  oh those are fabulous . 
  my german wife likes them too , but is always distracted because she can understand the original words too . 
  british citizens have lived there for centuries . 
  but they voted to remain in the eu by . . 95 % i think . 
  they might be more minded to rejoin spain in a few years . 
  it 's certainly possible . 
  i wo n't watch a dubbed movie . 
  the actors were hired for their talent . 
  they delivered a role according to the director 's vision . 
  that was physical and verbal , joined together . 
  dubbing removes part of the performance and makes it disjointed . 
  and it feels disjointed and fake . 
  if i am watching a great performance and reading subtitles , i sometimes forget i am reading the subtitles . 
  but it does depend on being a fast reader , able to see the lines and then refocus on the actors before they speak . 
  `` das boot '' springs to minds , and `` die untergang '' ( `` downfall '' ) . 
  i will seriously refuse to buy a dubbed movie . 
  if there 's no subtitled version , it 's not getting bought . 
  end of story . 
  rome . 
  history drips off every street corner . 
  as for the food ... 
  but i am moving to barcelona in a few weeks . 
  only spent a week there earlier this summer , but it 's already a contender . 
  yes , good points . 
  if you want to go world war 2 , then pg wodehouse should [ have an dishonuorable mention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p._g._wodehouse#second_world_war:_internment_and_broadcasts ) . 
  probably the best user of the english language to have ever lived , his reputation was somewhat sullied by his broadcasts for the nazis . 
  such a shame . 
  if you 've not read any wodehouse , i would urge you to . 
  who else can start a book like this ? 
   into the face of the young man who sat on the terrace of the hotel magnifique at cannes there had crept a look of furtive shame , the shifty hangdog look which announces that an englishman is about to speak french . 
  technically , i guess it would be [ oliver cromwell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oliver_cromwell ) .
