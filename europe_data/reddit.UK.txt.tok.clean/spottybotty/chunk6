  he led the army which defeated the head of state ( charles i ) and went on to execute him . 
  so technically , he was a traitor - but a successful one . 
  it could be further argued that - having won the civil wars for parliament , [ he betrayed * them * as well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oliver_cromwell#return_to_england_and_dissolution_of_the_rump_parliament:_1651.e2.80.9353 ) , since he marched soldiers into the building and dissolved the parliament . 
  he later assumed absolute power [ as a dictator ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_protectorate ) , thus betraying the original reasons for the civil wars in the first place . 
  and , by the way , also betraying everyone under his rule at the same time ( since they had just got rid of absolute dictators ) . 
  so bad was his rule , that the son of charles i was invited back to be king again after cromwell died . 
  looking at it from that perspective , cromwell betrayed : * his head of state ( the king ) * his parliament * everyone in his entire country so yeah , i 'd give it to cromwell . 
  and that 's even before we start to talk about his genocide of the irish and scottish peoples . 
  actually , it 's a bit more nuanced in english . 
  it means a collaberator with an enemy occupying force . 
  to me , it also brings to mind a slimy `` yes-man '' who will do anything to please his puppeteers . 
  so very much like the original guy . 
  i speak schoolboy french . 
  enough to get directions to places and order food at a cafe . 
  i was once approached in london by a family , talking broken english in a french accent , who appeared to want help . 
  i ventured , and the father 's face lit up with relief . 
  i replied , because it was in fact true - that was my destination , and we were no more than 200 metres away . 
  `` allez avec moi , '' i said , breaking the french language in several different ways simultaneously . 
  and we allezed up tottenham court road and to the museum . 
  i left them at the door , as i had urgent business , and i bounded off at high speed through the museum , day-dreaming of their return to france and of the tales they would tell their friends of the helpful englishman who had , against all probability , managed to learn enough french at school to get them - in person - to their destination . 
  it was only after five minutes that i realised what i had done wrong . 
  i had , using my natural london instinct of taking the shortest route , entered the museum through the back door . 
  none of the signs which i passed on my way to the front door ( which was where i had been heading all along ) were particularly helpful . 
  i had just left a french family , speaking no english , at the back door of one of the largest museums in london , with no helpful signs , and hardly anyone passing by to help them . 
  sometimes i wonder if they are still there . 
  clear blue skies in summer ? 
  maybe in england . 
  i 'm in scotland . 
  i saw the sun . . yesterday i think . 
  and a week ago . 
  it is august . 
  everything i have heard about the books i like - so it 's odd that i do n't like the actual books !, 
  i heard that tolkien was a linguist , and he went and created all the languages first , so that he could write believable dialog for the different races . 
  i also heard that he was basically a bit jealous of the folklore of the scandannavian countries and decided to write one for british people . 
  i * think * that where my aversion comes from is that when i was a teenager ( in the 80s ) lots of people were trying to imitate tolkien . 
  i read a couple of books like that . 
  they were awful . 
  but they used the same sort of language . 
  when i tried to read tolkien , i could n't help but think of those awful books and those sad people who used the language styles and sneered at people who did n't get the references . 
  interesting . 
  i have never read tolkien , though i have tried to a couple of times . 
  i ca n't get into him - which is weird because i * can * read david gemmell without any problems . 
  my mother , however , loves him . 
  different strokes !, 
  what turned me was going to look around the globe on london . 
  me and my friend looked at each other , groaned , and said : `` this is ace . 
  we have to come and see some fucking shakespeare here now , do n't we ? 
  booked two cheap tickets . 
  laughed our arses off . 
  best comedy i 've ever seen done live , and i did n't catch half the words . 
  i realised later that shakespeare was ruined for me by actors and teachers taking it too seriously at school . 
  imagine `` red dwarf '' or `` little britain '' performed onstage , but without the gags . 
  yeah . 
  macbeth is still a pile of shit , though . 
  i did n't scroll far enough back . 
  it was like watching a * nc convention and i think i triggered . 
  i was dating an american woman when this show was airing in the uk . 
  i 'll always remember what she told me :  i have no idea what they are saying . 
  none . 
  then one night i go out after work and i get drunk . 
  not normal drunk - like , as drunk as you can be and still be alive . 
  i come home , switch on the tv and i * understand every word * . 
  what the ** fuck ** is that about ? 
  i have no more of an answer today than i did back then . 
  i 'll let [ a scottish philosopher ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrmcxa1ybec ) answer that . 
  i ca n't say it any better than he does . 
   my mother had bigger tits and they say romance is dead, 
  oh , to add to my previous comment about # 35,000 minimum wage for uk immigrants - if you 're studying in the uk now , have a check and see if you can transfer within the eu while the uk remains a member . 
  you may have rights which could disappear soon . 
  i have no idea if it 's possible , but you never know . 
  you 'll have a much better chance of staying in the eu in 2 years if you 're already in an eu country . 
  germany ( for example ) has numerous masters courses in english . 
  you can learn german as you go , if you study there . 
  so if you 're not committed to the eu yet , then check out the other countries . 
  you can pick up a second language * and * do post grad work ( in english ) . 
  not sure if that all made sense , due to drinking . 
  you , sir , are going to find your future engagement ring at a very cheap price . 
  ** edit ** in case that 's a genuine question : silver is a precious metal , and shines very nicely . 
  gold is more valuable - just . 
  grey is somewhere between black and white . 
  it is the colour you see when you wake up after drinking too much whiskey when visiting the north of scotland . 
  actually , it is the colour you see when visiting scotland - period . 
  source : i live in scotland and have window nearby . 
  it is the height of summer . 
  hurrah . 
  i 'm going back to the early 80s in an english public school here , but i recall macbeth ( oh dear * god * , it took me 20 years to enjoy shakespeare after that - why oh why did they choose * that * depressing shitehawk of a play ? ) . 
  we also did a bit of chaucer ( with a dictionary to understand the naughty bits ) . 
  something about enshrining a chap 's testicles in pig shit and still swearing they were the relic of a saint , if i recall correctly . 
  that was temporarily slightly interesting . 
  we also read owen and sassoon . 
  i loved those poems . 
  i wish we had read harper lee and orwell . 
  i would have had a * very * different view if , instead of thomas `` how boring can i make this soap opera '' hardy we had been given some oscar wilde . 
  i have three favourite users of modern english , and they are : wilde , churchill , fry - in that order . 
  it 's odd , because as a child , i devoured books . 
  just not in school . 
  the books we got in school seemed to be insufferably dull . 
  yet outside of school , i read for pleasure . 
  i could do it for hours . 
  i do remember `` lord of the flies '' .
