i am convinced this is why a lot of americans supported the ira to some extent , because they were genuinely unaware that the republic is a thing that exists . 
  as an englishman , the only place i 've been to which is greener than england is ireland . 
  it 's positively verdant , and one of the most beautiful parts of these islands or europe as a whole . 
  and * i * do n't think you did come late . 
  the usa provided absolutely vital material support to the uk in our time of need and you will always have my sincere gratitude for that . 
  it was a lot to ask americans to fight the axis without actually having been attacked first . 
  but the general perception here is that britain fought alone after the battle of france and dunkirk , and we kind of did until the ussr and usa entered the war , only assisted by free forces from the continent and our empire . 
  i imagine the author like [ this ] ( https://vimeo.com/72381722 ) . 
  it 's hard with any itinerary in europe . 
  europe is compact , but most of these cities are at least two or three hours by tgv/ice/thalys / railjet or whatever . 
  if i had to pare it down to five hub cities then it would be brussels , cologne , vienna , geneva and milan . 
  you can get to li\u00e8ge , lille or antwerp quickly from brussels . 
  cologne is in the heart of the rhineland and it 's easy to get to d\u00fcsseldorf or frankfurt from it . 
  you could get to salzburg , linz or graz easily from vienna , but frankly vienna is more than enough for five days . 
  geneva is close to lyon and dijon in france if you tire of the city , and milan is again big enough that you can find five days worth of things to do , but turin is within easy reach . 
  in the uk the war is seen as a struggle by a lone bastion of democracy against nazi tyranny and oppression , and a time of great suffering in our cities , particularly coventry and london , during the battle of britain , followed by the eventual triumph of the empire and the usa , who were welcome , but a little late to the party . 
  russia does factor into it but not as much as it should . 
  even a lot of britain 's own battles like burma and italy are forgotten . 
  unless it 's north africa , normandy or the home front , nobody cares that much sadly . 
  flight to brussels , then li\u00e8ge , cologne , frankfurt , munich , vienna , salzburg , z\u00fcrich , geneva , milan , florence , rome , and fly back from fiumicino ? 
  i reckon that gives you 4 days in belgium , 6 in germany , 5 in austria , 4 in switzerland and 6 in italy and a day spare . 
  just be prepared for early and late trains or consider sleeper services where you can if you want to maximise usable time . 
  ireland for sure . 
  i mean we have so much in common , more even than with australia or new zealand . 
  and the irish sense of humour is the only one that is similar to ours . 
  oh , and tea . 
  love you ireland !, 
  of non-anglosphere nations , the netherlands is probably the most similar in terms of attitudes , and are also fucking awesome . 
  dutch also sounds like english to me , but with an alternative dictionary . 
  * ** uk ** - england is my home and native land , i 've visited scotland a few times but have shamefully never been to wales or norn iron . 
  * ** ireland ** - my grandfather was born and raised in killaloe on lough derg near limerick so i 've spent time in the southwest , and i 've done some fieldwork in connemara . 
  * ** france ** - my dad worked on the channel tunnel and consequently we visited a lot when i was a kid , plus holidays to paris and the c\u00f4te d'opale . 
  * ** spain ** - i studied spanish in school and visited barcelona for a week on a school trip , then almer\u00eda when i was at university for fieldwork . 
  * ** the netherlands ** - only visited amsterdam whilst travelling , and loved it !, 
  * ** belgium ** - visited brussels after amsterdam and loved it more than i thought i would . 
  great country and i look forward to coming back !, 
  * ** germany ** - visited cologne after brussels and did n't like it too much , but i 'm headed to dresden soon and then nuremburg which are hopefully better . 
  * ** austria ** - fuck me vienna is * legit * . 
  best city in europe !, 
  * ** czech republic ** - currently in prague and going to start exploring tomorrow , but it looks awesome . 
  brno is a bit crap , maybe that 's just me as a privileged western pigdog . 
  nice people everywhere , however . 
  * ** greece ** - visited athens , rhodes and santorini on a cruise . 
  was n't impressed by athens , but the islands are truly beautiful . 
  * ** cyprus ** - visited nicosia briefly , but most of my time here has been spent in transit . 
  * ** turkey ** - visited kusadasi and ephesus for a day on a cruise , both of which were awesome . 
  portugal , malta and finland are next on my list , after i get a job to pay for it . 
  wales is my next stop in the uk . 
  it 's small , warm , sunny and they speak english . 
  and everybody loves malta , right ? 
  italians are too busy living la dolce vita to want to go online . 
  i know what you mean . 
  i would quite happily live next to heathrow since i could look at a380s and b747s all day . 
  more than a few , sadly . 
  i 'm not belgian but i did visit for the first time recently , and you guys have a lot to be proud of . 
  i 'm proud of my country in the same way a lot of english and british people are , but i am not proud of the political elite and system that has governed since the 1980s . 
  i love our landscape , food , language , history and the tradition of tolerance and liberalism we have historically espoused . 
  i love the quiet english village as much as the busy heart of london . 
  i am proud and grateful to be kentish , english , british and european all at the same time . 
  i just wish we could force the changes we need in parliament like getting rid of fptp and becoming a federal state , and move a little further away from the usa on foreign policy matters . 
  still , it 's pretty great to be born an englishman . 
  you do n't bring regimes in from the cold by continuing to freeze them out . 
  we 've seen that with burma , cuba and now iran under obama 's presidency . 
  engagement and diplomacy always leads to the most productive solutions . 
  visiting prague for the first time in a few days , looking forward to a spot of debauchery !, 
  dibs on normandy and brittany !, 
  they 're ours anyway , the french are just caretakers . 
  i 'm currently in brussels for a few days and it 's lovely up here . 
  there 's some rain at the moment , but the temperature for the past two days has been mid teens at night and mid twenties in the day . 
  absolutely spiffing . 
  i 'm hoping that the heatwave dies down by the time i get to vienna in five days , though . 
  whoa , slow down there buddy , i do n't like it either but we ca n't actually do too much to these territories . 
  if we interfere with their internal government then it could alienate them as well and force them into declaring independence , at which point we have no influence any more . 
  it could also damage our reputation in the territories that behave themselves , like the falklands . 
  the government could do more to stop this , but it 's a little more complex than just saying that they are banned from being a tax haven any more . 
  channel islands , man , bermuda , caymans and british virgin islands are not in the eu . 
  the only british territory that is is gibraltar . 
  as a geographer by qualification , this is an accurate depiction of geography lectures . 
  such a good film . 
  everything comes together perfectly , and vidal is one of the most terrifying villains i can remember from cinema . 
  do n't see what ed miliband has to do with an irish patrol vessel or the migrant crisis , mate . 
  vive le france !, 
  apparently euboea is less associated with southern europe than the rest of greece !, 
  time to restore the pale , lads . 
  at the moment i would still vote to stay , but i am deeply disturbed by the lack of respect for greek sovereignty . 
  i could conceivably vote to leave now , not out of agreement with ukip , but because i want no part for my country in a bloc that was hell bent on breaking the will of a member state . 
  being in arrears means that you have missed a payment of your debt to a creditor . 
  it 's not a good place to be in for any individual , company or state since you still have the rest of the debt to pay off in addition to late payments . 
  a state default is an admission that it will not be able to repay it 's existing debt . 
  so is cyprus . 
  in any case , there is only a eurasian continent , so europe is whatever we say it is . 
  yay !, 
  out of interest , what city would you consider best showcases life in the netherlands ? 
  genuinely curious , as i 've shamefully never been !, 
  san marino , do you want to join the commonwealth ? 
  you can have australia 's place . 
  france still beating us by one vote . 
  please , someone , help us out !, 
  russian invasions of portugal and georgia confirmed ? 
  nigella you scrumptious tart , you .
