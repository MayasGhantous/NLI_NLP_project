  not for long . 
  global warming is a russian conspiracy confirmed ? 
  [ u wot m8 ?

  two thousand out of half a billion ? 
  they had best be some air jordans if they 're only going to shell out for a hundred soldiers . 
  i 'm no student of african history , but if you want an example of how large african states might have developed , look to [ kongo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_kongo ) , which was definitely the most significant sub-saharan state to survive most of the colonial period . 
  the kongolese nobility were very keen to adopt portuguese customs , culture and christianity , but kept existing power structures in place . 
  things would deteriorate later as some ( the merchants and settlers in kongo were generally opposed ) portuguese wanted more resources and slaves and tried to exert influence over the region from their colony in angola , but kongo was independent until the end of the nineteenth century . 
  the cost of changing over to right-hand drive would be ** astronomical ** for the uk , less so for the others , but pointless given that all left-hand drive nations in europe are islands and it 's easy enough to change sides at the other end of the ferry or the channel tunnel . 
  the cost of changing languages is negligible , at least in financial terms , and would lead to a more integrated and competitive europe . 
  he 's not proposing that every individual be schooled in english , just that the eu conducts it 's business in english . 
  it 's always bugged me that spain is n't on utc . 
  i can understand france , since they 're french ^ hon ^ hon ^ hon but spain , what did we ever do to you that you reject our glorious anglo time ? 
  no party in this election is irrelevant . 
  any government will be a coalition or a minority , and so counting on small parties is going to be absolutely crucial for passing legislation . 
  using modern nuclear weapons on any significant scale would be the end of civilisation on earth with or without a retaliatory strike . 
  the most populous part of russia would periodically be under threat from fallout being blown across from europe by prevailing winds , contaminating most of russia 's arable land . 
  the soil thrown up in the blasts would also stay in the atmosphere for a long time as in the krakatoa eruption , lowering global temperatures to the point where you 'd at the very least see massive crop failures in the few remaining fertile parts of the world , and maybe a new ice age . 
  1:55 loomynarty confirmed !, 
  it 's beautiful , but it 's not in europe !, 
  baikal is several thousand kilometres east of the urals . 
  constantinos ix aliv in hagia sophia, 
  fair play , i 'll confess i read the title and not the article . 
  still , how many times must we say no to this sort of crap before the government stops trying to implement it ? 
  our government can be authoritarian without becoming putinesque . 
  in most other western democracies legislation like this would be easily challenged in the courts as being unconstitutional , but our constitution is n't codified and is very poorly understood by the general public , and to boot our state institutions are very old and powerful . 
  not only will it happen if the executive wants it to , but they will easily be able to sell it to the public given the apparent sympathy for most of the press for anti-terrorism legislation . 
  and the next dozen similar pieces of legislation after that . 
  deep frying ? 
  well we 're actually a colonial hive mind . 
  they do n't call her the queen for noth -- your will be done , majesty . 
  brittany was actually settled by people from what is now cornwall , so the name was transferred from the islands to the peninsula rather than the other way around . 
  there 's a dispute * in ireland * over the name , but in every major language , and in english outside of ireland , the islands are called the british isles . 
  the dispute is a purely artificial one . 
  if you 've got a problem with the name , blame the greeks and romans . 
  the state was named a few thousand years after the islands . 
  skoda ( and seat and audi ) are part of volkswagen . 
  they use the same engines and chassis in a lot of models , so they 're already implicated as well . 
  running a chain shop or supermarket is a huge responsibility . 
  managers are being given charge of a share of a multi-million pound business and a large number of employees , and must be on call 24/7 in case of a break-in or fire . 
  they also share the overwhelming portion of legal responsibility in the uk in the event that anything happens on the premises , even if it 's not their fault or happens on a deputy manager 's watch . 
  i 've worked with my fair share of both good retail managers and bad ones , and most more than deserve a # 50k salary . 
  eva green is objectively the best frenchwoman . 
  or french anything . 
  fuck me , that was in * 2002 * ? 
  i feel ancient . 
  until quite recently , the royal navy had the most ships and highest tonnage in europe , but the sdsr ( strategic defence and security review ) that the coalition government implemented led to pretty heavy cuts across the armed forces . 
  now it 's all about having fewer , but more capable ships , centred around the two new carriers that will be delivered in the next few years . 
  the government has actually backtracked from some of the sdsr policies on the carriers , and is now fairly likely to commit to a full air wing for both of them . 
  the six type 45 destroyers replaced more than a dozen type 42 destroyers , but a single one could adequately defend an entire battle group from most conceivable aerial threats . 
  we 're moving from a dozen trafalgar and swiftsture nuclear attack submarines to seven astute class submarines which are much more capable . 
  probably the only renewal programme that wo n't see a reduction in the number of vessels compared to the present is for the new ssbns to replace the vanguard class . 
  they will probably stay at four due to it being a conservative manifesto policy in order to guarantee that a submarine can always be at sea . 
  the royal navy . 
  oh look , problems with europe ? 
  must just be perfidious anglos hamming it up again !, 
  hon hon hon !, 
  you can not seriously suggest that the euro has been a successful project . 
  nice idea but implemented * terribly * . 
  and now millions of people pay the price with austerity in southern europe because of it . 
  we 're certainly a central economy , even if we are n't central in a geographic sense . 
  just relocate the government to funchal . 
  boom , problem solved . 
  you can pay me later . 
  you can have them back , old bean . 
  this whole fleg thing is getting out of hand again . 
  turkey hosts nearly two million , and jordan and lebanon host hundreds of thousands . 
  this is all the more impressive considering that they lack the per capita wealth of the gulf states , and jordan and lebanon already host tens of thousands of palestinians . 
  wow , think i 'm going to be sick . 
  i knew about that stupid clock , but i did n't know they blew this up to put it there . 
  sierre leone is n't british territory . 
  the uk ended the sierra leonean civil war in the early 2000s . 
  that made a hell of a lot of sense . 
  i know , i 'm saying that some british people watch rt and believe it . 
  an emergency issue now , but one that has been boiling predictably for * years * . 
  we 've had at least three years of warnings about the humanitarian crisis in the mediterranean and no effective european policy was enacted despite political will being stronger , and the eu response to syria has been extremely muted . 
  it was left to member states to deal with the problem until mare nostrum ended . 
  the eu let this turn into an emergency through weak leadership . 
  heh , ok , whatever you say . 
   let 's not forget who the only country in europe was to sign up with the americans to lay the groundwork for isis and syria 's civil war . 
  pull the other one , mate . 
  the polish government was * gagging * for it to cement their alliance with the usa , and was on the ground in the invasion from the beginning . 
  let 's just go ahead and list some of the other european countries that took forces into iraq after the invasion , shall we ? 
  * spain * italy * czech republic * denmark * latvia * hungary * netherlands * norway * portugal * iceland * lithuania * romania * estonia * bulgaria * slovakia that 's most of the eea right there , and i 'm not counting the other nations like ukraine that remain outside of most european institutions that also got involved . 
  but nope , evil brits were warmongering , let 's ignore the rest !, 
  must be about the anglo disposition to violence , right ? 
  nice if you ignore the fact that the war was ** extremely ** unpopular here to the point where a million people marched in london in a bid to stop it , the biggest protest ever in british history , and several prominent and extremely well respected ministers resigned from the cabinet and destroyed their careers because they were that opposed to it . 
  let 's also ignore the fact that we 've ploughed almost a billion pounds of aid into syria since the conflict started in 2011 , more than germany or any other nation except the united states . 
  it 's nice circlejerking about perfidious albion , eh ? 
  i was being sarcastic . 
  there is no gibraltar issue as far as the british government is concerned , and spain has no leverage on the matter . 
  leaving the eu wo n't change those fundamental facts . 
  nice to know what a mod of this sub thinks of my home country . 
  i guarantee you would n't say the same about any other nation in the eu , am i right ? 
  unilever and royal dutch shell might be problematic , but they 'd probably prioritise one country over maintaining a major corporate presence in both . 
  then again , they both existed before the uk entered the eu , so maybe not . 
  having militarised the mexican border , it 's obvious that you do n't get any more illegal immigrants , right ? 
  the `` east '' never stopped , and channels like rt do a good job of sowing just enough credible news reporting amidst the fud that some people , mostly from the left or conspiracy theorists , see it as a viable independent alternative rather than a laughable putin mouthpiece . 
  i really do n't have a problem in fighting fire with fire .
