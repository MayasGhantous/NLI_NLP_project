  the humanitarian crisis is now , it must be dealt with now . 
  failing to deal with it will only make it worse . 
  there may be limits to how many people we can accept , but given how reticent most countries have been to accept even a handful of migrants it makes no sense to say that time is now . 
  if , as predicted and as you say europe 's population stagnates or even falls , then surely we could also really use some of those arrivals who choose to stay in europe once syria is back on it 's feet ? 
  the anti-refugee rhetoric really pisses me off . 
  i 'm against opening the door to illegal economic migrants from africa , but syrians and iraqis are not illegal , and they are not migrants . 
  they are ** refugees ** fleeing a terrible civil war that has included terror bombing , chemical weapons , a rising islamist threat seizing a third of the nation , hundreds of thousands dead , the history of their nation obliterated by fanatics and artillery , and a loss of infrastructure that will set their nation back by two decades . 
  fix calais , yes . 
  build camps in africa to process future migrants , sure . 
  attack people smugglers , fine . 
  but let 's not let the anti-illegal stuff get in the way of acting like decent human beings . 
  can you imagine if we had turned away bosnians fleeing genocide two decades ago ? 
  it would be criminal , scandalous and might bring down a government or two . 
  now we just blink and go along with the line that * others * are here to take what 's * ours * . 
  this selfish attitude is not what europe is about . 
  it also genuinely sickens me that basically every nation in eastern europe has bluntly refused to do even the slightest thing to help and actively refuses to do so , and unfairly increases the burden on the western members . 
  without exception , these nations have benefited hugely from the right to migrate simply by virtue of joining the eu , and their citizens have by and large have been welcomed in the uk , ireland , germany and the other wealthy states . 
  now , they refuse like pathetic cowards to do their part in a crisis that engulfs the continent . 
  eu membership brings with it a share of responsibility . 
  we 're not guaranteeing your defence and subsisiding your economies so that you can slack off when the going gets tough . 
  ** man the fuck up ** and act like a civilised society . 
  and just to dispel any notions of hypocrisy , i 'm all for the royal navy being sent to help in a big way with the rescue effort , and more than that i expect my government to offer sanctuary to it 's fair share of refugees . 
  anything less is inhuman and immoral . 
  brussels . 
  everyone was super friendly and there 's a real charm to the city centre . 
  i ca n't wait to go back !, 
  vienna is probably the most beautiful though . 
  my jaw was on the floor for a lot of my time there . 
  hapsburgs really knew how to build an imperial capital !, 
  a very close second . 
  [ dover castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dover_castle ) it has a special place in english history as the guardian of the channel and the first point of defence against invasions from the continent . 
  it sits on top of the white cliffs of dover , which also means that you have an amazing view of france and the channel on a summer 's day . 
  it 's been occupied more or less continuously since at least the roman era , with an intact roman lighthouse still standing today inside the walls . 
  it hosts an original , although heavily restored , saxon church , and other structures from throughout the last millennium . 
  a norman keep and walls , newer fortifications from the napoleonic era , and well as a huge labyrinth of tunnels from wwii . 
  it 's definitely one of the best castles in england and you should totally go if you 're in kent . 
  yeah , i was in new zealand last month and i did n't realise how big a deal cook was for both them and you aussies . 
  the maritime museum in auckland is practically a shrine to the man . 
  from a british perspective , i think that from the discoveries of cook to the establishment of responsible government in the colonies , australian history * is * british history . 
  as the federation took shape and constitutional links were severed , that history diverged into two different narratives . 
  christ , you 're a bit bitter mate . 
   you mean , the thing that is fucking the planet and all non-human species on earth today ? 
  great . 
  the industrial revolution means that you are , today , living like a king compared with the agricultural labourers of the 18th century . 
  to dismiss the benefits it has brought you personally and humanity as a whole is insane . 
  you are almost certainly alive today only because the industrial revolution happened . 
  modern medicine , telecommunications , mass transportation , high-yield agriculture , and more only exist because of it . 
   the end of slavery is not particularly due to the british empire . 
  the idea belongs more to the enlightenment philosophers . 
  well first of all many of those philosophers were british , and secondly how many ships did they contribute towards stopping the slave trade once banned in parliament ? 
  the royal navy had a significant role in shutting down the west african slave trade for good . 
  i 'm not for a minute saying that britain unilaterally ended slavery everywhere , but it was the most significant abolitionist force on the world stage right up until the last big slaveholders like the usa and brazil abolished the practice and the issue became an irrelevancy . 
   very unfair . 
  you ca n't compare with france and portugal . 
  you litteraly destroyed the native population of 2 continents ( north america + oceania ) , obviously you encountered less problems after this . 
  i also note that according to you , independance wars in usa never happened ... actually , the british crown maintained good relations with the tribes right up until the end of the war of independence , it was the american government that committed genocide against the native americans for the most part , although the canadian expansion was n't much less bloody but as a dominion , canada had autonomy in domestic affairs . 
  i wo n't even try and justify what was done in australia . 
  but i 'm talking about the old world colonies being disposed of after wwii . 
  france got dragged into indochina and algeria and lost badly , with hundreds of thousands of people dying needlessly . 
  britain did n't have any experience like that , and we have n't had to constantly prop up or intervene in our former territories to make them viable states unlike france . 
  paris acts like it 's rule never really ended when it comes to francophone africa . 
   just precise that this is a good point for you . 
  i barely see how it can be considered as an universal `` good '' point . 
  the development of a global lingua franca is a great thing for humanity . 
  i freely admit my bias as a native english speaker , but i think it 's wonderful that we have , for the first time , a truly global language that billions understand to some extent and which is growing in use every year . 
  i suspect you would n't be whinging if french were dominant . 
  good stuff : * the empire funded the industrial revolution in the uk , leading to the biggest improvement in quality of life in europe ever , and which is * still * changing the world today . 
  * the empire was , throughout most of the 19th century , a powerful force committed to dismantling the institution of slavery in a huge part of the world , not just in british territories but , through our naval power and trade hegemony , the territories of other nations as well . 
  * the voyages of great explorers like cook , shackleton and scott were borne from the needs of the empire to secure our naval dominance and/or press claims on new territory . 
  * we built a lot of useful stuff like the railways in india and burma . 
  * the empire wound down fairly peacefully , we did n't get into colonial wars unlike france and portugal , and a good chunk of the successor states have maintained a great tradition of democracy in their own right . 
  * the english language spread to so much of the world that it started the process of becoming a lingua franca , being finished during the hegemony of the usa . 
  bad stuff : * slavery was a core part of the empire in the new world , and cities like liverpool and bristol built their wealth off of the back of dead africans during the 1600s and 1700s . 
  * lots of expansionist wars that made no sense , like the boer war , and led to the deaths of thousands . 
  * we definitely messed up in a few territories when we left , like the raj and rhodesia . 
  * some pretty nasty stuff came from the imperial days like a fondness of eugenics , paternalistic colonial attitudes towards africa , the development of concentration camps and so on . 
  * the irish famine , which i 'm glad our nations have moved past but will remain a blotch on history for a long time . 
  * i do n't think that there was anything systemic about a lot of the atrocities that were committed in the colonies during the empire , but they still happened , like famines in india that were entirely preventable . 
  * we siphoned huge amounts of capital and resources away from most imperial territories , particularly in india . 
  * the opium wars . 
  christ , it 's a miracle that british people can even travel to china without being lynched in the streets after what we did there . 
  indeed , and the two problems are linked . 
  if you want to reduce migration to europe then controlling climate change and environmental damage is absolutely non-negotiable . 
  if you think countries like mali and niger are struggling now , wait until the sahara consumes their limited fertile land in the middle of the century . 
  it 's going to be a clusterfuck . 
  because the authoritarian left-wing parties are n't in any danger of winning anything on a european scale , but support for the authoritarian populist right , far-right and neofascist parties across europe has been growing . 
  syriza , podemos and their ilk are fairly liberal anti-austerity social democrats , and no real threat to democracy . 
  if it was a resurgent communist movement , i would be as opposed to that as i am to authoritarians on the right , and i would n't object to growing support for more liberal , laissez-faire conservatism and libertarianism , just disagree with it . 
  there was this [ little jaunt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii ) we all had a couple years back where some right-wing folks disagreed with the rest of the continent . 
  the migrants present a problem in and of themselves due to needing so many resources , overwhelming the poor border states , the possibility for terrorist infiltration , conflation between economic migrants and refugees , etc. , but they do not pose an existential threat to the eu or europe . 
  however , the resurgence of exclusionary and even violent nationalism as a result of this wave of migration threatens the eu , which is often associated with migration , and could lead to many more problems on top of that . 
  civil liberties are already being eroded under many democratic governments in europe , so it 's not much of a stretch to claim that some new form of fascism could take hold in some european countries if this crisis continues unabated for the rest of the decade , as it could well do . 
  [ ok  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hcspsc8t0m ), 
  granting a visa is n't a matter of criminal law , and the assumption of innocence does n't apply . 
  if there 's any suspicion that they are involved in terrorism , why take the risk ? 
  especially in the schengen area where you could endanger the lives of people not just in your own country , but much of europe . 
  we have a completely legal authority to issue or deny visas to non-eea citizens , so why not exercise that power and discriminate against those who would be a threat ? 
  it 's a highly secure fixed link , it 's basically impossible for someone to get through the tunnel undetected , and there 's one small , obvious exit with lots of traffic and security . 
  people walking through the tunnel might add one or two people , if that , to annual totals of illegal immigrants . 
  if you think that the channel tunnel is a security risk you are * insane * .
