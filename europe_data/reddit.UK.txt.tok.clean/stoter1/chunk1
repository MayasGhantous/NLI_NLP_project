oil 's a volatile commodity anyway , you northumbrians would be mad to even want it . 
  and yous lesser scotlanders get hull !, 
  haivers fae the colony again !, 
  greater scotland would clearly be the celtic union . 
  northland would clearly be lesser scotland , like lesser poland or the lesser antilles . 
  lesser scotland . 
  hoho !, 
  how many popes is he ? 
  yeah , but they 've got 2.27 popes per square kilometre . 
  you need that many police when things get so weird . 
  the celtic-words are interesting !, 
  i did n't realize that would be well knows . 
  any examples ? 
  an interesting west-coast scandinavian link is [ somerled ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/somerled ) , particularly the genetic links in people who are macdougalls , macalisters and macdonalds !, 
  oh , the north of scotland do have a strong image of themselves being norse . 
  they even have their own cruciform flags . 
  the western isles too . 
  there are a lot of sandy haired folk in the west who have a vague idea their ancestors are viking . 
  my family too . 
  given 90 % of icelanders have scottish and irish genetics i wonder if anyone from iceland looks to scotland or ireland and consider themselves kin . 
  could you slow down and speak more clearly please ? 
  how about scottish or irish ? 
  thanks for elaborating !, 
  over 90 % of the population are descended from scottish and irish thralls . 
  to celebrate i 'll have macaroni for dinner instead of penne !, 
  i doubt you ever butchered anyone . 
  the blue is n't pantone 300 . 
  that 's the saltire 's blue . 
  let 's just say it 's `` welsh blue '' on the butcher 's apron . 
  except when talking about your fanny-pack ... 
  mr or mrs mcglumpher . 
  irish , usa/canadian , polish , indian , pakistani , japanese & ` oriental ' .

  in each of the three indigenous languages : scots . 
  scottish . 
  ( or scotsman/scotswoman ), 
  tastefully obscure . 
  it 'd be a bit crass to give it the name of your own country . 
  one could imagine , were the usa to be compelled to come up with a new anthem today it 'd be called : #america !, 
  haha , aye , that 's a pure shocker !, 
  texas , i guess . 
  the battle of stirling bridge . 
  some australian guy made a film about it and forgot to remember to put the bridge in . 
  haha , was that it ?!? 
  he looks like he 'd get on well with our prince edward . 
  there was the norwegian campaign . 
  jerusalem is nice though . 
  mind , there 's [ the freedom come all ye ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1btp49cwr8 ) tae !, 
  that 's what i was thinking . 
  is n't he visiting the king ? 
  sadly we do n't go in for overlords , you 've got to talk about politics all the time every day and twice on thursdays . 
  stop listening to the southrons , the ne is lovely and i 've had some great holidays over at blackpool on the other side too !,

  [ visit scotland ] ( https://www.visitscotland.com/ ) !, 
  let 's get there asap !, 
  we 're already building a [ space port ] ( http://www.spaceportscotland.org/index.asp ) and it could be ready by [ 2019 ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland-leading-race-to-host-uk-s-first-spaceport-1-3990738 ) . 
  kirk and sulu , along with our mps are [ backing it ] ( http://uk.askmen.com/video/news_house/scottish-space-port-endorsed-by-james-t-kirk-and-sulu.html ) !, 
  that 's somewhat comforting to know . 
  i guess england is aware that before 1066 they were partly , then wholly part of denmark . 
  for us scots , and irish , it was norway we got jiggy with ... 
  thanks !, 
  sorry if i 'd misled you , i thought my being slightly tongue in cheek initially had been clear . 
  i do think rome had been incapable of doing it , but more due to it being spread all too thinly . 
  latterly , when rome could not pay tribute , there were pictish invasions that were part of the depredations across the whole western empire . 
  thanks for the article !, 
  there are arguments , in the books i linked to and in others that the german limes and the scottish walls were signs of the death of rome . 
  that it was either at its limit of expansion or had given up the political make up to allow it to expand further . 
  that empires with imperial centres have a size limit based upon technology and communications limits , or that they fail to have sufficient internal organisation to maintain themselves . 
  under this theory the mere decision that somewhere is not worth conquering means that the empire is incapable of conquering it . 
  the whole might of the empire focused could have conquered scotland , but it could n't focus that might , so it 's castles in the sky to say it could have , because it did n't because it was incapable of doing so . 
  one source is : [ this ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/caledonia-pictland-scotland-edinburgh-history/dp/0748612327/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1495621770&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=from+caledonia+to+pictland+scotland+to+795 ) and the 1st edition of [ this ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/iron-age-northern-britain-settlers/dp/1138126314/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1495621882&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=iron+age+scotland ) . 
  purely from an economic assessment of building and maintaining the wall you can see that they were n't leaving the area alone . 
  it was a strategic means to control scotland and an economic decision . 
  rome could not afford to conquer scotland . 
  if it reallocated its ample resource to do so , rome would have fallen . 
  that seems to have been the decision at the time . 
  rome was overstretched and could not conquer scotland without potentially losing areas far more vital to its continuation . 
  it could n't have conquered scotland . 
  you see ? 
  a little , more for your historiography . 
  there were campaigns of conquest , which did not bring what is now scotland into the empire . 
  being more serious , the walls were built precisely because scotland was economically valuable to rome . 
  there are coin hordes in scotland ( and ireland ) through the whole period of occupation of what is now england/wales . 
  what about the [ kingdom of the isles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_the_isles ) ? 
  or [ other bits of scotland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_scotland ) ? 
  then why did they build and maintain two massive walls over hundreds of years ? 
  they failed to conquer what is now scotland . 
  roman apologists in 2017 . 
  mad . 
  the survivors of [ doggerland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doggerland ), 
  it 's amazing that these places all predate the pyramids too !, 
   their language did anyway . 
  only so far as ethnonyms . 
  pritainia is odd in that it survived rome without winding up with a latinate language . 
  however germani , like scotti , seems to be a brythonic celtic word that was latinized . 
  so likely to be the self-name from almost 1000 years before deutsch , or albanach , emerged !, 
  in scots ( germanic language ) the word for germany , during the hre , was * dutchland * . 
  havers !, 
  they fell back from the antonine wall after eight years of its completion .
