  and then they retook it and abandoned it almost immediately . 
  you can attribute this either to the attacks of the brigantes and caledones or to the instabilities in rome or other parts of the empire , either way the empire was in no state to capture these territories . 
  and that 's why we call you germans and not allans or deutsch !, 
  screw the imperial scum !, 
  success , evidently . 
  we 're still here ... 
  the mighty roman empire found us so unconquerable they built a massive wall that stands to this day . 
  ( and they paid for it . 
  also the inspiration for george r.r. ), 
  it 's horrific . 
  if it hits 23 celsius in scotland everyone gets heat exhaustion !, 
  to read that they took wooly jumpers and the like for trade is woeful and then to hear of the first colonists starving of hunger , at first hunting giant tortoises and then being to weak to even catch them . 
  but to have our own king , william of orange , to order the dutch and english not to help them and ultimately to let the spanish lay siege and take the colony still reads like a massive betrayal . 
  scotland 's border used to go roughly from preston to middlesbrough . 
  might have that back ... panama , nova scotia , new jersey and that bit of carolina could be fun to have too !, 
  ( the loss of all this led to the union with england , the rich scots were offered compensation for panama in exchange for signing the acts of union 1707 . ), 
  you should look at it as [ the wars of the three kingdoms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wars_of_the_three_kingdoms ) to get the scottish and irish perspectives too !, 
  and you all used to be so out-going too !, 
  until peter the great ... 
  oh , leanne , say `` the valleys '' again ... 
  dublin , because with brexit , and with my hope scotland will return to the eu , i 'd like it to maintain english as the main language . 
  enough isolationism is promoted in the uk without us being cut off further by a language barrier . 
  they 're bloody everywhere . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2013/aug/12/glasgow-vegan-capital-of-britain they should go back to vegania . 
  seriously though , as a committed omnivore , having so many vegan restaurants in town is a treat . 
  tonnes of ace chefs and the food can be a delight * * ^ when ^ taken ^ as ^ part ^ of ^ a ^ balanced ^ diet . 
  nordic history . 
  scotland , england , ireland and wales shared in the history for hundreds of years too . 
  i 'm surprised there are n't stronger links and that more is n't made of north sea/atlantic culture . 
  i thought that 's what hungary was !, 
  i thought it was this sense : http://dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/hale or this : http://grammarist.com/usage/hail-hale/ rather than hail . 
  every day a school day . 
  pace yourself ... 
  like [ this ] ( http://www.tuffgnarl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cadbury.jpg ) ? 
  in scots we have : wabsteid - website ( appeared 1 year after website , as far as i can tell ) stoor-sooker - a vacuum cleaner whirlygig - helicopter, 
  that sounds , in translation , like something the doctor would prescribe . 
  is that the same in german ? 
  i hale from the [ best educated country in europe ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/scotland-is-best-educated-country-in-europe-1-3435273 ) , we value it but that makes it hard to stand out in interview . 
  most call centre folk and baristas have multiple degrees and work for minimum wage . 
  i 'm considering the states to get regular work . 
  invite everyone round to our place . 
  start drinking all the ale , lager , mead , tonic wine , whisky and gin . 
  black out ( again ) . 
  wake up three days later and wait until the lawyer gives us the answer over an irn bru . 
  the best way to make any decisions . 
  why should you defend yourself in a fight , i mean it 's only a genetic fluke that you 're you and not some hairy arsed orangutan in some sheik 's private zoo ? 
  someone who does n't wash . a soap-dodger . 
  my grandfather was too young to go to war , but worked in the clyde shipyards . 
  he lived in renfrewshire on the south bank of the clyde , he watched helplessly for two nights as the luftwaffe bombed the yards and the industrial town of clydebank on the north bank over two nights killing about 700 people , some he knew , and destroying the whole town . 
  only 7 houses were not hit and 35,000 people were made homeless . 
  my other grandfather , who i did not know , was one of the homeless , who walked over the hills as part of the refugee group of tens of thousands who went to glasgow . 
  it 's quite a constant that people in scotland and england try to remind scottish people that they were complicit in the british empire . 
  `` the english lead it , but the scottish ran it '' they say . 
  though the irish , aussies , kiwis , welsh , south africans and many indians were also highly complicit i 've never heard anyone try to put post-colonial guilt on them . 
  swiss , surely ? 
  glasgow - blacknecks , violent edinburgh - snobs , loads of non-scots aberdeen - like their sheep , do anything for american cash dundee - den of thieves perthshire - teuchters oban - posh teuchters highlands - big easy going alkies dumfries - tory farmers fife - inbred england - posh bossy eejits that join all the committees and ca n't take a joke . 
  wales - aberdonians with funny accents . 
  northern ireland - family ireland - family and good lads . 
  did you see that councillor , i think in northumbria , who was elected by drawing straws ? 
  the coin-flip get used on occasion too !, 
  tbf our non-electronic systems are massively open to abuse . 
  i mean i just cleared up myself on the register as i was on 2 rolls , and i did n't have to prove i was myself at that council election there . 
  the postal vote system is also notorious . 
  the whole thing needs to be tightened , but that way id cards lie . 
  if trustworthy , an e-voting system would be good . 
  but it is n't trustworthy at all . 
  it 's only provenance that recommends our current system . 
  you should include that above . 
  i find it interesting we 've the three : fptp , stv and mixed member proportional representation with fptp and modified d'hondt list system to elect our representatives . 
  i 'd only seen that in burgeoning democracies in africa . 
  saying that , there 's little to stop voting multiple times in scotland . 
  there 's nothing to even identify you as a legal voter or that it 's you who 's voting . 
  i love your estonia-card system . 
  i wish we trusted our government so . 
  if you go with spain !, 
  ( actually as english folk get all offended very easily , there 's nothing inherently wrong with them , but a post independence reunion on a more equitable footing would be far better than the current unbalanced system . ), 
  we 're already [ scotireland ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/scotireland ) for all intents and purposes . 
  we need to give london to russia for 50 years . 
  thanks for the interest !, 
  it 's a [ scots word ] ( http://dsl.ac.uk/entry/dost/crak_v ) going back at least to the 15th c . it went into scottish gaelic and irish and ulster scots . 
  it 's also the root of the american racial term `` cracker '' , it was used as an insult for common folk from [ 1509 ] ( http://dsl.ac.uk/entry/dost/crakkar ) in scotland , and then in the colonies by the masters against the scots indentured servants which was picked up by the slaves . 
  but american and english philologists ideologically favour the `` whip-cracker '' folk etymology which has no textual evidence , because of traditional biases against scots . 
  it 's tiresome . 
  they do n't roll their rs , they keep saying they 're not a celtic people when we all know they 're just a bunch of welsh people pretending they 're saxons after about 20 actual saxons beat some of them up , and their mixed up belief that they 're the chosen people of jerusalem or something robs them entirely of having any good craic . 
  it 's doing a hell of a little for * you * either !, 
  nice try pompeo !,

  the [ scottish wildcat ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/scottish_wildcat_%26_kitten.jpg ) subspecies is under high threat here , due to interbreeding with the domestic cat . 
  they 're spreading !, 
  i 've never bought one in sobriety , i generally eat reasonably healthily like many scots , but indulge this kind of food on occasion . 
  it 's a battered and deep fried pizza . 
  search `` munchy box '' for a favourite scottish post-pub snack !, 
  no bother . 
  here 's a bonus , the pizza crunch : http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3022/2775199531_188bdf2cf7_z.jpg, 
  like a hamburger made of pork and chinese or bbq sauce , this is its [ innards ] ( http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/52/a6/2e/greasy-king-rib-soggy.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hwacd5ysugs/u8qzeqnh6oi/aaaaaaaaagi/vuegk3r1-i4/s1600/wp_20140719_16_23_50_pro.jpg ) is its healthy state . 
  apparently it 's a northern irish , scottish and northern english thing .
