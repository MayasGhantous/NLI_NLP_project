  no co-op ?!, 
  amazing considering it even occasionally [ makes up the government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/co-operative_party ) tescos is all though , especially since it [ invaded denmark ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0psyirxieyc ), 
  funnily enough , a lot of folk in paisley . 
  that bucks a few stereotypes . 
  you 've got to visit it , jist tae gowp . 
  i was working wi the outlander folk in the western highlands and mentioned it to them and they set their driver on a 70 mile round trip for their lunches !, 
  hollywood . 
  no , still trying to [ ditch the aristocracy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/69maxt/what_role_do_your_aristocracy_play_in_your_country/ ) . 
  deep fried anything , including : * pizza * pies * chocolate bars * haggis * king ribs * hamburgers * fritters all with chips . 
  if you 're in glasgow smothered in grated cheese . 
  often on a roll . 
  a favourite of mine is a macaroni pie . 
  most of out sweeties are almost pure sugar : tablet , coconut ice , macaroon , soor plooms , grannie sookers . 
  ireland . 
  or iceland . 
  or norway . 
  i have come across a handful of irish royalists ( from the republic ) i find it astounding that people would want that lot back . 
  is that yer anglo-irish lot ? 
  did they not continue in france and still hold the titles ? 
  like prince philip of greece in the uk ? 
  so it 's just the royal family left ? 
  wow !, 
  is it just the royal family who are part of the state ? 
  what would a typical title be ? 
  what privileges do they get if they pay for them ? 
  it 's an incredible affront to consider our country a democracy . 
  i was wondering ... you get the odd king of scotland popping up every now and again . 
  but no , it 's elizabeth i of scotland . 
  wow , the princess has her own youtube channel !, 
  does she lay any claim on croatia ? 
  or even visit ? 
  i was there . 
  glory days !, 
  jamaica might be nice . 
  3.9 on my first night in a new flat in [ manchester ] ( http://www.earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/research/manchester_sequence.html ) i thought it was my new flatmates jumping about in the middle of the night . 
  my clock radio bounced along the bedside cabinet . 
  in scotland you 've island names for girls : iona , islay . 
  harris and lewis for boys too , now i think on it . 
  with f1 cars being known as the world 's best billboards it seems ludicrous to be charging a subscription for people to be looking at the billboards . 
  i 'm so conflicted about the pay to view , if the sport proves to be super competitive again i may , may , may subscribe seeing it 's the only sport i make sure i have to see , but i think you 're right it 'll nosedive . 
  i 've hear that . 
  the current world champion driver and team are german yet the interest is falling away . 
  odd . 
  is it all football there ? 
  it 's hard not to be a fan of wee max !, 
  rain , rain , snow , sleet , rain . 
  unless it 's summer and that day is nice . 
  they 're just extensions of the normal outside territorial gangs , because we tend not to put people away for like 257 years . 
  they maintain the social groupings they have outside . 
  or england ... 
  [ really ? 
  ] ( http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1586852/ukip-leader-paul-nuttall.jpg ), 
  nah , just looking for decent patter . 
  you misunderstand scottish nationalism ... 
  who 's upset ?!, 
  that 's the laziest banter going !, 
  so , it 's not immature ? 
  and , yep , when you look at the narrow minded reasons given , it does . 
  really , brexiteer ? 
  yep , rednecks fuck shit up for everybody . 
  i fear using anything other than that from your fisher-price bundle of nasty words would sail over that malformed redneck lump you call a head quicker than your father jumped the privet hedge upon finding he 'd put baby you inside his sister 's belly . 
  imagine thinking a scot has run out of insults , ya redneck !, 
  hahahahahahaha !, 
  so the problem is the trade unionists ? 
  so is a world view based upon stereotypes ... 
  thatcher won , eh ? 
  sounds like her propaganda . 
  you could use those arguments easily against westminster . 
  in the uk it 's south of the border , for sure . 
  yep , here you go . 
  as i understand it it came in through the monks from ireland and scotland who went into charlemagne 's service and columbanus . 
  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=rich edit : seems to be differentiating between rich , from ri , and rice . 
  different from what i have read . 
  if you come across anything let me know !, 
  from gaelic : ric - english - bishop ** ric ** - scots - king ** ric ** ( kingdom ) - most germanic - reich from scots some words that changed their meanings like : glamour ( a spell ) , weird ( fateful ), 
  hill - ** billies ** . 
  is it not convention to name an archipelago after the largest isle ? 
  what do you think the logic behind this is ? 
  i pretty much always say `` these isles '' to avoid the imperial connotation . 
  how about real haggis then ? 
  kinder surprise eggs . 
  i did n't say it was a secret . 
  do they really , though ? 
  do they really ? 
  the argument could be made that the prejudice against eastern europe caused brexit . 
  our current pm 's department were so terrified of ** eastern europeans ** coming to the uk that they [ advertised ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/27/uk-immigration-romania-bulgaria-ministers ) in romania and bulgaria that the uk is a horrible country and they should n't want to come here . 
  ( in spite of the massive push to buy holiday homes on the black see in the 2000 's . 
  i had a bulgarian estate agent on my road in manchester , england ! ), 
  i 've been party to ` pub debates ' about whether or not poles are eastern europeans or not . 
  meaning are they to be trusted ? 
  i have been asking that question for a while irl . 
  due to the nature of my work i can count friends an acquaintances from just about every european country yet i have never met a belarusian . 
  they seem to only exist in the eurovision qualifiers ... 
  that 's what we 're supposed to think , but they do have a large influence , [ vetoing bills ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/14/secret-papers-royals-veto-bills ) for example . 
  but we 're not supposed to know about that . 
  the monarch does [ veto bills ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/14/secret-papers-royals-veto-bills ) . 
   they also reveal the power has been used to torpedo proposed legislation relating to decisions about the country going to war . 
  they also reign supreme in the [ duchy of lancaster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_lancaster ) and the [ duchy of cornwall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_cornwall ) . 
  but we 're not supposed to know about these things . 
  we 're the original stereotypes , after the english decided to call what we thought of as food , drink , clothes , music etc.
