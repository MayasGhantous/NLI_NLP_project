  my experience of speaking with english friends is that none of this kind of thing need ever be considered on their part . 
  i hope that gives a wee bit of insight . 
  i do n't quite get what you 're saying there , care to elaborate ? 
  i suppose it 's at least partly because it 's ever present , every concession is on the smaller nation 's side . 
  scots are always the `` other '' to the english/british norm . 
  as a scot you 're not able to go a day without being made aware of this . 
  yeah , that whole two generation jacobite period was great ... 
  that argument seems strange considering the extent of bribery of scottish parliamentarians and placement of spies such a daniel defoe . 
  all being one sided . 
  i think the union was far more important to english foreign policy than it has been spun . 
  even the abandonment of `` england '' for `` great britain '' suggests it was very much to the advantage of english aristos and merchants . 
  i 'm sure it was to the advantage of the wealthy on both sides though . 
   scottish-forced ? 
  good surname !, 
  it is quite common where i grew up . 
  :d i was just saying i 'll need to get some vinegar in too . 
  i should be able to get some ham hocks ( common enough in scotland ) . 
  thanks , i 'll try it out , if i can get the greens !, 
  how do you cook them with ham ? 
  fried , boiled ? 
  i did n't know the leaves were edible !, 
  nice !,

  it 's a running joke on the newspaper in the link , its name is often misspelled deliberately after it misspelled its own name : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_guardian#references_in_popular_culture, 
  nice !, 
  parts of the dancing look familiar too : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzablewe9fe, 
  i know quite a few [ flemings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clan_fleming ) . 
  that 's very long lasting !, 
  there 's a [ romantic story ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbbzyfs33hi ) behind that !, 
  that 's an old old clan !, 
  haha , grand !, 
  you know there 's still a one o'clock cannon in edinburgh . 
  edinburgh on the baltic !, 
  it looks nice . 
  i remember seeing a book of burns translated into russian when i was young and being amazed someone scottish would be put into russian . 
  i look forward to reading some mikhail lermontov !, 
  that 's brilliant , thanks !, 
  that 's magic !, 
  flag buds :d, 
  gerard butler brought them back after filming 300 . 
  this . 
  and places like the cowal peninsula too , up until the [ battle of largs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_largs ) leading up to the treaty of perth . 
  the gudraian is just trying to sell papers , it is that simple , 
  partly , yes . 
  hibernia predates * scotti * and it seems that scots was the name for the sea raiders or pirates of the irish sea . 
  their territory probably includes bits of argyll in scotland . 
  people from the north of ireland did invade argyll in the 5th century , but the people there may well have already been scots . 
  caledonia , pictavia , and alba were the names for scotland before it was scotland . 
  it looks like the people who were to become the english may have named scotland !, 
  best answer yet , 
  you 're talking about new turnips , or english turnips , those horrible wee white things . 
  turnips are big and purple . 
  but what we do with them !, 
  ( do n't tell the english but their [ northumbrian pipes ] ( https://youtu.be/hiumwskhsgk?t=1m23s ) are beautiful ! ), 
  merci !, 
  nice song !, 
  i assure you your prejudice is wrong . 
  you subscribe to that ? 
  merci !, 
  were the 1707 act to cut all english trade off from those countries that were scottish enemies it would look isolationist to an english perspective . 
  the french , dutch and baltic trade that the east of scotland had done for centuries was over , glasgow benefited by having the trade with the american colonies recognised and buying into the slave trade after a while . 
  trade shifted to being within what was formerly the english empire . 
  not at all !, 
  we just think you 're mental . 
  xxx , 
   luxembourgs military does not match in size nations like the united states or russia but ... from luxembourg 's wikipedia article , i suspect we share a pride and confidence in national character too !, 
  a contentious monarch , to say the least . 
  certainly his supporters were amongst the most anti-european in the brexit debate . 
  which is quite ironic given william ii 's ( as he 's known in scottish genealogies ) interest in european politics . 
  the parades are n't the most popular things in the west of scotland for those who do n't take part . 
  he 's still celebrated daily in glasgow with many parades each weekend for at least half of the year ... 
  merci !, 
  haha , by what fraction are you scottish ?!, 
  not asking you for your name , but would i recognise it as scottish if i saw it written down or has it dutch ( or more ) spelling conventions that make it look dutch ? 
  i 've more of the galgael herritage , the norwegians who settled the west of scotland and took on the gaelic language and laws . 
  i 'm a big fan of the [ shetland flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/shetland_flag.jpg/800px-shetland_flag.jpg ) , one feels there should be something similar from the western isles , argyll , and galloway . 
  i 'll have a wee [ fraoch ] ( http://www.williamsbrosbrew.com/beer/fraoch ) tae calm us noo . 
  so no finlayson no nokia , or tom ?!, 
  ( he 's kent as `` tam o finnlan '' in scotland  ), 
   konigsberg he was trying leave but he had to cross each bridge once and only once ... 
  i do n't know even what that first one is . 
  is is some sort of kitchen implement ? 
  hows about the old latin for irish being * scotti * though ? 
  that 's astounding , some good ones in the thread . 
  bloody huns :p, 
  the welsh , 
  that 's amazing !, 
  i read kant after hume and at times it 's almost like he 's writing directly to hume !, 
  i do n't know what you mean with that [ last point ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2cjrvr9zvw ) there ... 
  there 's something familiar about those [ toories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pom-pom#toorie ) on your hats and shoes too !, 
  awesome !, 
  alex ferguson , good govan man !, 
  there 's a trade link between scotland and sweden that if not true makes a good story . 
  the root vegetable known as a `` swede '' in england is known merely as a turnip in scotland . 
  what they in england call a turnip is n't really eaten in scotland . 
  supposedly it 's due to the baltic trade . 
  it 's also the traditional vegetable eaten with haggis and potatoes . 
  in scots is a `` neep '' or a `` tumshie '' , so the old joke when someone says `` i 'm a swede '' in scotland the reply is : `` no , in scotland you 're a neep / tumshie / turnip . '', 
  great facts , until that last one there ... , 
  as the saying goes : copper wire was invented when two scotsmen were fighting over a penny .
