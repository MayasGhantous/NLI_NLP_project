yeah , watching this again this afternoon , i wonder how the opinions in the statistics shown in the video are actually made . 
  china 's media is controlled by the state - their perception can be controlled to a large extent . 
  yeah , but my point is people * do n't * do this as much as i would like - political action on an individual level is not something that comes to the forefront of every joe and sally and hans and grete with a day job , because they barely have the time to formulate a worthy opinion regarding it , nevermind take action . 
  they would rather just listen to the media , or sign a petition , or join a mass strike . 
  like a herd . 
  i think a system of direct democracy like in some parts of switzerland might work well , but i do n't know much about that at all . 
  with today 's technology , it 's also possible for mps to gauge public opinion in an extremely fine-grained manner . 
  but [ the voice of the people is not the voice of god ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-public-wrong-about-nearly-everything-survey-shows-8697821.html ) ( [ via ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1hxyyo/british_public_wrong_about_nearly_everything/ ) ) , and such a system would require that the public is actually informed properly in the first place , because their entire political opinion is built from what information they perceive . 
  in fact , it can be argued that a * demo * cracy where * demos * is uninformed is a flawed system entirely . 
  i have n't had a proper real-life conversation with anyone outside of my family about eu-level politics . 
  ^ ( edited for 22 mins after posting ), 
   is it such a bad thing to have many different systems ? 
  no , certainly not . 
  i think it 's a very good thing . 
  it gives us as individuals the choice of which system to live under . 
  edit : granted we have freedom of movement from whatever country we originally live in . 
  i think that western systems should get more of a balance between democracy and `` selected rule '' - like the house of lords is currently and how the us senate used to be - where people are ** selected by competence ** , not by how good they are at speeches . 
  and also , the democratic part needs to be far more fluid and convenient for people to participate in - like he says there , our systems in the west are `` elect and regret '' . 
  people should understand what they are voting for , it should n't be * complicated * . 
  the house of lords in the uk is the right idea . 
  but i have a problem with the people in there , especially those put there because their ancestors were there , not because they are actually qualified . 
  not to mention bishops . 
  ^ edit : very recently , there have been calls from the lib dems to make the lords partially or fully democratic . 
  i do n't think that 's the right idea - i think the selection process needs to be changed . 
  ^ / e [ how the house of lords fits into the system ] ( https://ourgoverningprinciples.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/uk-fusion-of-powers.jpg ) is good despite the selection process being bad . 
  except for how the lords have less power than the commons these days . 
  the european system ( the ec ) also strikes the right idea , but i do n't think it fits in the system the same way as the house of lords does . 
  ^ edit : probably the most striking difference is that the executive of the uk sits in the elected house , not the appointed one . 
  ^ / e one can argue , though , that all these systems do not allow for ^ edit easy ^ / e political reform - there is no single body to manage ^ edit and review ^ / e political reform exclusively ^ edit and without influence of the political system itself ^ / e . 
  ah , i think whatever i watched mentioned al qaeda as well . 
  whatever i watched cited [ this letter ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/30/world/africa/31kidnap-docviewer2.html ) . 
  i quote from it ( page 5 ) :  thanks to allah , most of the battle costs , if not all , were paid from through the spoils . 
  amost half the spoils came from hostages . 
  kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil , which i may describe as a profitable trade and precious treasure . 
  ~ ~ i ca n't find the original video in my internet history , i guess i watched it on my phone . ~ ~ ^ ^ edit2 : [ found it ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2015/08/cost-living-150804111240145.html ) - [ and here 's a higher quality video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjw9bteb-7e ) ~ ~ ^ ^ edit : in case anyone watched it and have the link , and want to bother looking for it : ~ ~ ~ ~ it was from a canadian news agency , it was around 20 to 30 minutes long , and it involved an interview with a released french hostage ( released by isil , who i think was kidnapped/held with james foley ) , another interview with [ a finnish couple kidnapped in yemen and released after a ransom was paid ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/ny_times_multi-million_dollar_ransom_paid_for_finnish_hostages/7384213 ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure the canadian company that produced the film also [ nearly ? ], 
  lost one of its journalists to kidnapping . ~ ~, 
  no , to give them money would mean that isil gets more funding to kidnap more people . 
  ~ ~ kidnappings are their top source for income right now ~ ~ ( ~ ~ will get a source when i am at my pc to search my internet history ~ ~ [ found it ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2015/08/cost-living-150804111240145.html ) - [ and here 's a higher quality video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjw9bteb-7e ) ) . 
  he is already dead , in my eyes . 
  if norway pays , more innocent people die . 
  edit :  raise money to save this man life once you see that they use this money to just kidnap and kill more innocent people , and expand themselves , then you will see that you actually just meant `` raise money to kill more people '' . 
  i also feel sorry for this guy , but he should have simply not travelled there . 
  there is nothing good that can be done for him now , apart from a rescue attempt . 
  neither does france , [ and magically their citizens came out okay ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjw9bteb-7e ) . 
  they just pay through shady third parties . 
  ^ ^ edited ^ ^ for ^ ^ link, 
  tl ; dr : the article says the negative reactions to migrants are driven by racism and western hypocrisy , and europe 's past refugee crises did n't end in society being harmed . 
  at least that is what i could make out from the wandering drivel . 
  [ it 's right side up poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monaco#/media/file:flag_of_monaco.svg ) . 
  to clarify , a princip ** al ** is a person which leads ( principal teacher = = hauptlehrer i think ) , and a princip ** le ** is a certain fixed value on which all actions are based ( prinzip or grundsatz ) . 
   that does indeed make them economical immigrants ; they are not terrible humans because of it . 
  yes , but everybody else , including people like me , has to go through the normal visa and migration systems to get here . 
  do they get a free pass because they are * former * refugees ? 
  edit : it 's not so much about what kind of human beings they are , but more about treating everybody the same before the law - treating economic migrants as economic migrants , and refugees as refugees . 
  thank you , / u/czokletmuss , for bringing the mods to account and so helping to improve the quality of this subreddit for all its subscribers . 
  there 's an eu way of correcting things ? 
  i agree with the quoted statement , the majority of britons do n't want to see this , despite the votes . 
  the majority of britons are more left than the parties they vote for are . 
  http://journalismfrommars.co.uk/2015/01/26/how-far-is-public-opinion-from-the-political-centre-ground/  the polls and surveys do n't show that the population is either right or wrong , but they do show that on a lot of major issues , the political `` centre ground '' may be far to the right of the population . 
  edited because i read your quote wrong . 
  edit2 : our party system no longer serves us . 
  that 's hilarious . 
  do you know where the official response is ^ edit if there is any yet ? 
  else , do you know where one will appear when they do make an official response ? 
  ^ / edit i can understand a bit of dutch but ca n't speak/type enough to search for where it is . 
   when most eurosceptics talk about the eu they are n't thinking about regulations but immigration . 
  i disagree , or at least i wish this was n't the case . 
  when i think about the eu , i think about how they have the power to make laws over us ( admittedly we do have a large input into those laws and get a lot of exceptions ) which erodes sovereignty . 
  i 'm an immigrant and i think immigration is good for this country . 
  i 'm just against the concept of continental voters having influence over the laws governing us ( and vice versa , by principle ) . 
  another thing that makes it hard for me to find a voice with the rest of the eurosceptics is how they bang on with climate change scepticism as well , which is really ~ ~ sad ~ ~ upsetting . 
  in all , i 'm still formulating my opinion on the eu . 
  i believe the eu has made a net benefit to people in the uk and europe so far . 
  i 'm just against the concept in principle , and seriously doubt this benefit will last forever . 
  when i look at america , i see * less * democracy after their union . 
  edit : also , states ' power in the us decreases over time , in favour of central government ( federal ) power . 
  ** online ** : the guardian , ars technica , bbc news , reddit ( / r/unitedkingdom , / r/europe , / r/news , / r/worldnews , a few others ) , a few other sites at whim , word of mouth . 
  if i get linked to a specific story on one site , i tend to go to that site 's homepage to see what other news they are reporting . 
  i 'm originally from south africa , so i also used to look at news24 and beeld , but over time that country 's issues have become less and less relevant to me , so in the end i only read beeld ( now called netwerk24 ) to keep up my afrikaans vocabulary . 
  ** tv ** : bbc news , al jazeera english , euronews . 
  i do n't like ads on broadcast television/radio , so it would be mostly state-sponsored news channels like that . 
  ** radio ** : bbc radio 2 when i 'm in the car . 
  again with the ads on most other services . 
  no you do n't , stop lying . 
   gauck still needs to sign it ... which he just might not . 
  how often does he not sign an act that was passed ? 
  and burritos . 
  england lacks burritos . 
  if they do this , none of them can expect a life in politics ever again . 
   commission , parliament , president of commission , president of council more like : `` ein volk , ein reich , welcher f\u00fcrher ? '', 
  filthy british degenerate here . 
  ~ ~ we ~ ~ people i know also tend not to care that much , unless it is implied by the ~ ~ owner 's ~ ~ occupier 's behaviour . 
  and that was even before brexit . 
   `` oooh , a worm ! '', 
  `` oh goddammit , another human . 
  put me back quicker please . '', 
  well , english is a greek dialect . 
  it 's not a very funny joke . 
  but the joke is that they messed up the countries .
