  plus a bunch of other parties entering such upyd and pacma . 
  pure pr would make the situation even worse . 
  used to use those at school , they 're just not much good compared to the other ones though . 
  nah we do that in england . 
  those meal times are way earlier than in spain actually . 
  2.30 and 10 from experience . 
  no shit , pointing out that they could have it worse .

  ciudadanos would never support a government which was also in bed with a catalan nationalist party though , their whole reason for existence to be spanish nationalist/anti-catalan nationalist , and have said no parties should have agreements with nationalist parties . 
  equally they said they wo n't support a government which relies on podemos . 
  it 's not gerrymandering , and look at the uk , 4 million votes per seat for ukip vs less than 30k for snp . 
  the catalan nationalists gain from chaos , they wo n't support anyone . 
  the worse spain looks , the more people will support secession . 
  spain has 17 autonomous communities , you ca n't really include all of them . 
  nah they 're not doing that anymore . 
  redrawing yes , but not reducing . 
   that assumes that immigration is n't intrinsically part of britain , which is of course just denying reality . 
  urban areas , particularly london , birmingham , and yorkshire ( e.g. 
  bradford ) , have *** always *** been places of high immigration . 
  if by always you mean , ` for the last few decades ' , i agree , but it 's a strange use of the word . 
  intrinsically means ` belonging to a thing by its very nature ' . 
  unless you have a very poor grasp on the history of our country , then immigration as we see it today in britain is not and never has been an intrinsic characteristic . 
  movement of people has always happened , but as it is now , where at the last census 37 % of people were foreign and less than half white british ( * in london , bollocks missed that out ) ? 
  this is very much a modern , unprecedented phenomenon . 
  as john cleese said : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxm1mqbgxcm, 
  can i have evidence for that ? 
  a bit spurious to base that just on patterns of voting for ukip . 
  a bit silly to pretend that people who do n't live in areas with high numbers of immigrants have n't been affected . 
  barking and dagenham in london for example , went from 80 % white british in 2001 to being minority white british in 2011 . 
  most have gone to much whiter areas in essex and kent . 
  massive numbers of white people have left the cities as they saw their communities change too quickly , and a lot of them have negative feelings about immigration . 
  not really , people refer to the welsh , irish , scots , manx , cornish and bretons as celts regularly .

  they do exist !, 
  i think there are elements within comprom\u00eds and m\u00e9s that are catalanist ( pa\u00efsos catalans and all that ) , but it 's not official policy and i agree that this map is nonsense . 
  it 's a nonsense map . 
  i think this map should be restricted to movements where ** outright separatist ** movements have parliamentary representation . 
  as far as spain is concerned only catalona and the basque country , galicia . 
  elements of parties in valencia and the balearic islands are pancatalanist , and elements of the bng in galicia are pro-independence too , so at a stretch those could be included too . 
  i say this as a majority of these movements are a joke , case in point the only one from england - cornwall - is n't really a movement at all , and do n't deserve to be on this map . 
  2/21 living in the west midlands , chart checks out for me . 
  nice revisionism there . 
   `` those who believe in concepts of the caliphate and the apocalypse -- so much part of daesh [ isis ] propaganda -- stretch deep into parts of muslim societies , '' blair said . 
  `` a belief in innate hostility between islam and the west is not the preserve of the few . '' not quite the same as support for isis , it just means they share some of the same ideology . 
  the point is right though , these ideas are far from being marginal and out-there , they 're held by huge numbers of muslims - and that is one of the reasons they have been successful in attracting so many foreign fighters . 
  if they 're from kosovo or albania they 're not refugees . 
  from that list you 'll only find refugees from a few countries . 
  did better than my countrymen on everything but guessing the number of fatties . 
  number 1 ranking at the end . 
  this is n't the basque country , this is catalonia . 
  [ the last poll done in the basque autonomous community ( euskadi ) found only 22 % want independence ] ( http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2014/12/19/paisvasco/1418991866_549275.html ) . 
  [ in catalonia that 's higher ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20151202/30539747175/independencia-ceo.html ) , 46.6 % for , 48.2 % against . 
   the start of a process to unilaterally break away from spain not really true , the pro-independence coalition jxs have been saying all along they want it to be negotiated , a unilateral severing of ties was always a last resort and something they could n't have done given the results of their ` plebiscite ' ( only 48 % voted for pro-independence parties ) . 
  the cup , a smaller left-wing pro-indie outfit , has said , before and after , that 50 % + was needed to make a unilateral move . 
  something tells me there are plenty of cdc ( conservative catalan party ) deputies in the jxs coalition . 
  not least mas ( the leader ) himself , that would never support unilateral independence . 
  it 's really just a bargaining position from which to secure recognition of catalonia as a nation with a right to decide . 
  with elections coming up the three largest spanish parties ( psoe , pp and c 's ) have all categorically stated they will not accept the right to self-determination or catalonia as a nation . 
  only podemos - the ` spanish syriza ' - defends spain as plurinational and calls for a referendum , but they 'll get no more than 20 % of the vote and will have no way of realising what is only a peripheral aim in any case . 
  then there 's the fact that the cup and jxs ca n't agree , so we may end up with new elections in a couple of months . 
  people are ignorant and proud of it . 
  i know students at my uni who before the election last year did n't even know the difference between left and right wing , or what communism was . 
  this is at a good russell group uni . 
  ask them about the latest kardashian bullshit or x factor , then you 've got a convo . 
  most people are pretty fucking stupid . 
  that 's from the gross , not the net figure . 
  most students go home . 
   would you be ok to have cat and dog breeding and slaughtering facilities in europe to accomodate people whose culture allows to eat them ? 
  yes , but then i 'm a vegetarian so i do n't see any logic in discriminating between eating different animals . 
  either it 's okay to eat none or all . 
  can i have a source for that claim ? 
  what history i 've read on the matter says you 're full of shit . 
  ' [ we cover bomb attacks in beirut too but you show less interest ] ( http://blogs.channel4.com/lindsey-hilsum-on-international-affairs/cover-bomb-attacks-beirut-viewer-show-interest/5646 ) ', 
  when you grow up with all your female family members and indeed all adult women in your community wearing the hijab , that amounts to a massive pressure to conform . 
  just as we all have pressure to conform in various ways . 
  muslim girls grow up expecting that 's what they 'll wear , it seems normal to them , there is no debate . 
  that 's what i mean when i mean there is no real choice . 
  i think it 's obvious why it 's a rejection of western values such as gender equality . 
  ` choice ' - how much do you really have when there 's overwhelming societal pressure and you 've been doing it since your mum placed one on you when you turned 10 . 
  coerced or not it 's a rejection of our culture and values . 
  they live in northern cyprus though . 
  unilaterally , they would be accepted by almost no one - same as with catalonia . 
  an agreed independence and neither will have any issues . 
  it 's got absolutely to gerrymandering , it 's done by province , ca n't gerrymander that . 
  catalonia 's electoral system is no different from the rest of system in giving more weight to rural areas , pretending this is some evil nationalist ploy is bullshit . 
  look at what 's happened to occitan , which in the middle of the 19th century by over 30 % of people in france . 
  it 's now almost dead . 
  it 's entirely possible that catalan would have gone the same way - just look at the ill health of catalan in rosell\u00f3 . 
  this suggests that 44 % of people in the republic want to be part of the uk , which simply can not be true . 
  transvestites are n't necessarily transgender . 
  is it though ? 
  i never really see ni as really being the same country , it 's a part of ireland we control . 
  been having a lot of john terry-defending debates with mates in the past few days , think i 'm just a bit weary of unfounded tabloid nonsense - and tone is harder to convey through text . 
  allegations from an unnamed source , published by someone with an axe to grind , say he put his member in a dead pig 's mouth . 
  why so many people swallow whatever shit is published i will never know . 
  that guy 's fucking nuts . 
  he thinks evolution is satanic , the big bang is a ` fairy-tale ' and that prison turns men gay . 
  just unbelievable that so many people in america vote for complete and utter cretins . 
  rights should n't be up for a vote .
