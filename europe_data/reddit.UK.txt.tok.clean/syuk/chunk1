the eu moves so slowly it is ridiculous no doubt it is all part of a grand plan but it looks like greek people are not being looked out for or given any considerations . 
  i did n't know about tatchell - [ here is a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2lr1wnp52w ) of it , in belgium . 
  no longer un , its u seless . 
  burner phone , internet hosted sms gate ? 
  nice idea , i like them . 
  the one for piran ( # 6 ) would make me nervous of shark . . 
  it is people living in areas where there is not much for them to do , but that does not excuse the vandalism and attack of the police . 
  i honestly thought this was a ` the onion ' piece when i saw it on twitter earlier . 
  why do you say ` self delusion ' is becoming an issue ? 
  are you from belgium . 
  did you see what one of their mps said about the economic benefits they could look forward to ? 
  no surprise that poland has assessed the risk and decided it would be too dangerous to accept the `` refugees '' . 
  i wonder how many of these monster lurk in calais ` jungle ' camp . 
  in 2009 it was said that 81 % of somalis in the uk do n't work or contribute to the economy . 
  55 declared no go zones !, 
  is this the story that was here a few weeks ago that some people discounted ? 
  is molenbeek an extremist bridgehead in europe ? 
  i like the orchestration of [ this version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbwovfy-rxu ) . 
  maybe we 'll hear in a month or two . 
  ask troops to risk their lives whilst they see hundreds of thousands of fit , military aged men running from the war zone leaving their kids and elderly behind ? 
  it is an invasion , and anyone with any sense will do well to call the bluff . 
  [ fuck brussels !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ozedztx3wuw?t=71 ) , no meddling in the break fast . 
  they sacrifice their reputation for efficiency here but retain their well loved sense of humour / s, 
  the migrants know they can act almost with impunity and they will be protected or face little repercussion , life would be better where they are no matter what now . 
   290,000 immigrated for work , but 41 % did not have a definite job to go to . 
  [ link ] ( http://order-order.com/2016/02/25/migration-figures-everything-you-need-to-know/ ), 
  indeed , germany wants to remove 200k migrants but 179k do n't want to go . 
  i was hoping some other nations would also want to leave . 
  it is economic migrants not asylum seekers that cause the concern . 
  i really do think cameron did try to get a realistic deal , and it is sad to see people belittling the effort . 
  on the other hand it is sad to see him not say ` fuck it ' and get behind campaigning for us leaving the eu after he sees what he has got . 
  it seems like people in the eu are benefiting from our contributions but do n't appreciate us at all , very disheartening to read some of the feeling even in this thread . 
  not many complain about russia nowadays . 
  in kent , england it was alleged that this was happening , [ and the publisher of the story was investigated ] ( http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/ipso-complaint-upheld--adult-33340/ ) . 
  is this just another ` con trick ' by the governments ? 
  what good is it for them to create such a big mess . 
  this is not just a local news story , as it points to how the system may be being exploited :  `` ms mezher was stabbed at the ** centre for refugee children ** aged between 14 and 17 ''  * it will add to growing suspicions that a large portion of the 35,000 unaccompanied refugee minors who claimed asylum in the country last year have lied about their age , claiming to be under-18 in order to take advantage of more generous asylum rules . 
  were the stories about using microwave ovens also a fantasy ? 
  i remember reading about that years ago on / . 
  got any links to the kind of foods there will be ? 
   schulz imagined a scenario where a german working in london in 2017 received less benefits than her british colleague , while that colleague 's son in berlin enjoyed the same welfare arrangement as germans . 
  i think the whole notion of benefits is going to be just too big of a headache to administer properly . 
  time to pay people $ 10 an hour to wave signs again . 
  because they are not stable country , they do n't give a shit about peoples rights or they are just holding out for more . 
  europe is in this fight with its hands tied behind its back , less civilised and progressive people will just take the piss . 
  this [ article ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ro&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ro&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=www.gandul.info%2fstiri%2frevolta-intr-un-orasel-din-satu-mare-cand-s-a-aflat-ca-aici-va-fi-un-centru-de-refugiati-o-sa-recurgem-la-violenta-15001001&amp;edit-text= ) says they are trying to make place for dozens of refugee in ardud ( ? 
  in my limited experience we can easily take the piss and get on alright , in some places consumerism is seen as an american thing , litigious society , credit , personal responsibility maybe these aspects are different in other parts of eu and even ireland . 
   and that is why we have public media channels that do n't depend on company money . 
  we have a good one , the bbc . 
  ^ ^ ha ^ ^ ha, 
  eu wanted people to agree to help disperse the first group and then be able to come back and say ` how about 2000 more , how about these kids ' and use the press to pressurise it . 
  it is a death sentence for whoever takes them , thanks to merkel who did zero screening and encourage them to come . 
  it is good for polan to take this stance and i hope other nations say the same . 
  it is mind boggling , the eu leaders must be smoking crack . 
  good on this people , they must be horrified to see the damage these clowns are doing to what once were stable places . 
   you know , i would n't bet on it . 
  what makes you think that ? 
  from some of the stuff i 've seen on tv the refugees in the camps are going to school and preparing for life in places like the uk . 
  damn , those are some pretty tight standards . 
  my opinion : there is nothing ` fair ' about plans to distribute millions of ` refugees ' to the detriment of a nations stability , heritage , prospects and security . 
  it is a choice of each nation to decide , not up to eu to try and strongarm anybody . 
  how do they know so much about this ? 
   first , these were opportunistic , organised crimes organised opportunities ? 
  what does this mean . 
  the existing laws are not capable of handling this , in most european countries . 
  i am interested in how the police will deal with people who have seen ( and some will have committed ) heinous crimes against each other . 
  still ongoing . 
  it was a while ago but [ if you believe in an independent britain come with me and i will give you back your country ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/468183.stm ) . 
  ^ when ^ he ^ was ^ mr ^ hague . 
  i would hope not , but when things get left to worsen it is harder to sort it out . 
  i think the french and uk if necessary should start reducing the size of the camp and not permit any new residents to move in . 
  they should be sent back to their point of arrival if they do n't ` accept ' imo . 
  do n't they have to make the errors more visible nowadays and not hide them away . 
  impossible to do that with the volume and the pressure from the media and the left . 
  there 's a message in there . 
  what is the deming craft ? 
  there was a post a few months ago about how some countries are selecting and screening their asylum seekers , not just welcoming everybody . 
  how do the people who do n't have papers later bring their families ? 
  the whole thing is naive as shit . 
  housing programs in rural areas for african migrants could revitalise zones with little economic activity , but it will take time . 
  that pay safe card is interesting . 
  [ here is a video of some activists in calais ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mja9rfniihy ) . 
  he was being sarcastic , lets hope the russians detected it . 
   the public listened to this man we do n't listen to experts !, 
  i will laugh when the dangerous fantasy equates to german army keeping peace in france and french army keeping peace in sweden , italian army keep peace in belgium etc etc. 
  i honestly believe he wants to just destroy the country , david cameron might have been right when he labelled him a threat to our national security . 
  deutsche -7.77 % it 's a black hole , october will be interesting . 
  telegraph has been disappointing for a while now , . 
  not many papers in the uk seem to tell it straight or avoid clickbait nowadays . 
   free healthcare and free housing neither of these are free , someone else is footing the bill for them . 
   the uk has more to lose , so when the eu is not perfectly satisfied with the outcome of the negotiation , they will just say : `` we ca n't reach a compromise , so we will not have an agreement in these matters . '', 
  look what that attitude has led to !, 
  you hope russia will make concessions , heh . 
  the eu reaches its expiry date if it must be spiteful to uk after so long . 
  ha have you seen jeremy kyle programme in america ? 
  nice to think they csn improve peoples lives . 
  the best thing the working class can do is to avoid television and the media , comparison is the death of happiness amirite, 
  the uk does n't need any low skilled migrants , we have 3 million odd unemployed . 
  this a good idea imho .
