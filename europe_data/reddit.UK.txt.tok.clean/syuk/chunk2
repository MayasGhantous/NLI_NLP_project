  if it is against the rules , how has it got to have such a well known silly sounding name ? 
  it is good to see people having fun and making friends with the help of the pokemon . 
  [ the gravy train ] ( http://images.crestock.com/30000-39999/30423-xs.jpg ) has left the station . 
  ah right , my mistake . 
  the nuke system is mirv so it probably wo n't be defeated by russian defence . 
  we are n't leaving all the alliances we have behind , unless relations really degrade due to pettiness . 
   patronising drivel that should be the guardians tagline . 
  it should herald some kind of reconsideration regarding immigration policy if nearly 70 % of a particular group ca n't or do n't work , but instead lets invite thousands more . 
  one such gang was busted earlier today , so lets hope there is more to come . 
  sorry i was making a lame joke - stepon over vs jumpan over, 
  people who voted leave probably have never been within 5 foot of an ` immigrant ' . 
  her sister jumpanova is hurdles world champ . 
  ha ha , i hope your attitude is the one the negotiators take . 
  what a happy gang the eu is !, 
  reported by an eye witness - https://www.youtube.com/embed/omjjibtbgl4, 
  it 's done to lessen public panic and deflect criticism of the government and the ss / police who are no doubt worked too hard already . 
  france has also got 7k illegal immigrants in ` the jungle ' . 
  i get the idea that if they stopped ` saving face ' and admitted the problem they would have to admit it was unsolvable now . 
  horrendous , people like this wo n't be happy until there is civil war or worse in europe . 
  if they are subsidised = paid for by taxpayer.once big companies employ them probably claim it against tax as well . 
  it ca n't be neccesary in some places with high unemployment . 
  cheap labour ? 
  i was under the impression that asylum seekers could n't work and that many migrants come for welfare and if they work at all then it is in the black economy - therefore contributing nothing to pensions and civil service .

  not a particular fan of jeremy hunt , but the current situation with the bma , junior docs and the nhs is nothing new at all and all politic . 
  there is some discussion in [ here ] ( http://www.mickfortune.com/blogs/paul/health-policy/just-what-was-the-bma-opposing-in-1948/ ) about the bma written in 2012 , political activism and the funding of doctors and other ahp . 
   `` there is a new kind of perpetrator , who is rapidly radicalized and skips the usual steps between discovering extremism and committing an attack , '' he said , calling the new phenomenon `` turbo-radicalization . '', 
  could n't they just already be ` radical ' before they arrived ? 
  i 've got some romance fic ? 
  firing acid out of water pistols ? 
  i agree , it could have been set in stone , but the opinion polls were / are worthless and no one ever learns . 
  there are so many of them now that they just help form opinions rather than reflect them . 
  anyway , lets remember what dc said [ back in may ] ( https://twitter.com/david_cameron/status/732562392131997697 ) . 
  how do you know that the majority of people under 40 voted remain ? 
  if it was 60 % then people would want it to be 70 % , 80 % if they did n't get the outcome they wanted . 
  i have a big feeling that russia will not be hosting the world cup , and they know that . 
  lots of english hooligans have travel orders banning them from going to the tournament . 
  from some of the comments it looks as though it is the ` normal ' fans facing down prepared russian hooligans with weapons , gum shields , gloves etc. 
  that 's a cool paint job , reminds me of star wars somehow . 
  this sounds ominous . . 
  i saw this on twitter earlier , the pictures of the scene are a bit depressing . 
  it said that armed chechens had ` ambushed ' the yazidis . 
  lots of nikes and fancy looking handbags , lively music and bright coloured fabrics . 
   regrexit -- aka brexit regret -- is a real thing . 
  no it is n't , and the last thing we need is new buzzwords . 
  it 's a done deal - ** now get on with it ** . 
  high speed train . 
  if this is true , then it shows how contaminated the waters must be in the eu if they would not take it . 
  another reputable newspaper reveals the diplomats also rejected egg mayonaisse sandwiches , fearing they were being plied with poisonous danish insectieggs and german butter substitute . 
  always ` ex ' or ` former ' criticising , is it new ? 
  this is never going to stop is it ? 
  replace our payment to the budget ? 
  the other side of our press will telling folk in the morning about how there is a plot for the german and dutch to kill or render us senseless with poison egg . 
  one good things about these egg , i can enjoy egg and soldiers again instead of egg and soldier ants - and if i rub them on my dog he wo n't have the flea for a while either . 
  i 'd have nothing against eating horsemeat , but the mislabelling and the supposed standards are what concerns me in that particular incident . 
  the insectieggs are a fairly concerning thing though , because it has slipped under the radar during the ` chlorine chicken ' ree-ing by loud elements of our leftist , anti-american media and is probably much more of a realistic concern . 
  it involves a chemical that is not supposed to be used anywhere near the production of food for human consumption , how long has it been used etc - there is now a criminal investigations to find out . 
  more tripe from the independent . 
  seems like the only bad imports we really have to worry about are some belgian insectieggs and some eu ponysagne . 
  they are the taking the piss , every penny must be itemised and accounted for . 
  the longer this goes on , and the more articles like this then the more bad feeling . 
  he does n't speak for everyone , it is impossible to generalise like this anyway . 
  i do n't speak for everyone either but it was fear of what the eu will force members to become for me , which is what will happen to poland , brexit is the circuit-breaker . 
  the big picture is when the workers do n't have any rights and although a lot of money changes hands an ever decreasing amount goes to public services because its in the grey economy . 
  it has been there for 2000 years ffs , london how long as well . 
  this will be one of the better things to come out of the process . 
  and if when the cap gets cut . 
  i hate these ` articles ' with their ` could ' and ` maybe ' doom mongering , if there is increased animosity during this then you can lay the blame at the medias door .

  thought it rang a bell . 
  every nation has problems , but a solution can not be to import hundreds of thousands of folks for whom there is little opportunity , at great societal and financial expense . 
  they will soon have access to france nukes . 
  not just that , people also accuse of being racis or bigoted too . 
  they take the boat back to be used again !, 
  i 'm glad we are getting out of the eu , its clear its leaders act without a thought for the people in cases like this . 
  thank you . 
  when will this ever end ? 
  i think was partly ` in secret ' trial , the first i heard of it was today .

  [ how the eurobarometer blurs the line between research and propaganda ] ( http://www.mpifg.de/pu/mpifg_dp/dp15-6.pdf ) . 
  [ pdf warning ]  this paper reviews eurobarometer surveys from 1995 to 2010 and shows how eurobarometer selects and frames questions in ways that systematically produce `` integrationist '' outcomes . 
  did the figures ever get updated about where the migrants are coming from ? 
  it was around 2 % syria a few weeks ago . 
  it is the popular fashion to put ` despite brexit ' at the end of reports concerning the uk . 
  nice infographic m8, 
  with russias help maybe . . 
  have you got any evidence that it is benefiting the industrialists ?

  similar offers on television here in england , was tempted . 
  people look for offence in everything , even if it has nothing to do with them at all , it gets them a few clicks . 
  sad, 
  this is the kind of tough actions eu needs . 
   islamic or african where you live why not both ? 
  more anti-uk bile from the guardian . 
  england riots the perpetrators were punished pretty quickly and soundly , going along with unrest is just as bad as directly instigating it so lots of people -  clink, 
  does it mention family reunification too ?
