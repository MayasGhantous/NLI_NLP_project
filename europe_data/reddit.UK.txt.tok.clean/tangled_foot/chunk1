tories do n't have a majority , they wo n't get anything like that through . 
  the lib dems would never back this , if they did , it would be the end of the party , most of their mps are heavily pro europe . 
  labour would not back it on principle . 
  no way this will happen under this government . 
  yup , also , more flexible working schedules , having a generation of kids brought up by their child minders and nannies sounds like a pretty bad idea to me . 
  the fact that 50 % of the population work from graduation to retirement , and of the other 50 % ~ 75 % will take at least ( and it really is * at least * ) 6 months out of their primary paid employment to have kids * has * to be a huge factor . 
  pregnancy , that 's the cause . 
  damn , i should be a government advisor or something . 
  i 'd consider banning an item of religious clothing pretty damn right wing , even if your socialist politicians still support it . 
  countries that do n't have armed police . 
  republic of ireland 3 . 
  new zealand 4 . 
  cook islands 5 . 
  falkland islands 7 . 
  iceland, 
  i do think we kind of have a complex about it , but its just ingrained into who we are , aside from special events ( of which , to be fair , there have been a shit load of recently ) we are exceptionally un patriotic , more so than any country i have ever been to . 
  you never see union flags on people 's houses , and people will constantly go on about how other countries are better than the uk , i think this stems from the fact that we spent the last 500 years going on about how we 're the best country in the world and repressing people and now we 're a bit embarrassed about it . 
  we know that actually we 're pretty fucking awesome , but we 'll never go on about it to people from other countries . 
  yeah , the way it was reported in the british media was that he got as far as he did because people were so disillusioned with the other options that they either did a protest vote , or did n't vote at all , then , when they realised there was actually a chance he could get to power everyone knew that would be a disaster and actually voted against him . 
  ah , ah , here you are , acting all socialist and shit , but you 're forgetting one thing !, 
  you banned burqas in public buildings !, 
  that 's pretty fucking right wing !!, 
  there is no * way * the uk would do that . 
  so , the national front , guns and banning burqas ... basically mitt romney :p, 
  thatcher . 
  but he still got to the second round !, 
  no one that right wing would get close to being pm in the uk . 
  yeah , i agree , and who cares about who has more extremists if they 're not getting into power anyway !, 
  ok , then , so guns and the national front being a legitimate political party , we 'll leave it at that . 
  oh maybe , i guess if you 're coming at it from a workers point of view its socialist , if you 're coming at it from a religious point of view its right-wing . 
  all i know , is its really annoying !, 
   i 'd be interested in what makes you think france has been more right-wing than the uk ? 
  yes , me too ?!, 
  the only way i can think of that france is more right-wing than the uk is that your police carry guns , oh and lots more stuff shuts on a sunday . 
  - hardly great markers of a right wing society . 
  maybe he means that there are more people who would like france to be even further right , i.e. 
  le pen nearly got elected , he 's more right wing than anyone who has been a contender for pm in the uk in my lifetime . 
  the national front are more right-wing than any major british party . 
  he 's right in some ways , we are a small island , we used to have a massive empire , we do n't any more , but that is n't really something british people give a shit about , in fact most people are quite embarrassed that we went around invading and exploiting people . 
  interestingly do n't think i 've every bought anything that was built in the usa , actually , i lie , i bought an american apparel t-shirt that was . 
  but that 's the point right ? 
  as financial centres and some of the worlds largest economies we do n't need to , we move money around and make a load off that and we design things that other people build . 
  you will have used loads of stuff that was designed in the uk . 
  its just not built there . 
  i do n't think he did it deliberately , that would be stupid , even for him . 
  however that is one way of interpreting those words , and the british press hate the republicans so he should have at least made sure there was no way his words could have been mis-represented . 
  add to this that most people are not proud of the empire , its not hard to see how people could interpret it as ` you used to be dicks and invade other countries , now you 're just a little island that builds nothing ' . 
  he should have just said , ` you 're going to do a great olympics , your country is lovely ' , and leave it at that . 
  its true , but generally its not a good idea to come to england and talk about how great we were at repressing people , that goes down quite badly , most people are not proud of the empire , but you know , while we 're at it , look at all this cool shit we built off money from the slave trade too !, 
  its all about the tenses , it may not even be deliberate , but he 's saying england used to be great , now it does nothing and is small . 
  ` england ** is ** small and does nothing ' , ` england ** was ** big and ruled everything ' . 
  the man 's a fucking retard ,, 
  that 's why i wrote all that  also , its that they 're deep and they spend a lot of time underground . 
  the victoria line is deep and never goes above ground . 
  the northern and circle lines get a long way out of the city centre before they do , on the underground you can tell when a train is arriving not because you can see it , but because you can feel the warm air being pushed out into the station as it moves towards you along the tunnel . 
  the trains run , the underground does n't . 
  problem is there is basically nothing lu can do about it . 
  i shall explain . . basically , the london underground is really really old , not the trains and things , they 're all quite new , but the system itself is the oldest subway on earth . 
  there are two ways to build a subway , one is ` cut and cover ' this is the most common , new way , its the one employed by most subways in the world , you dig up a road ( cut ) , lay a train track , and cover it over with the road again ( cover ) . 
  parts of the london underground were built like this ( circle and district lines particularly ) , these have no problem with temperatures , they 're only a foot or so below the ground , they have air conditioning and everything like other subways . 
  however , many of london 's lines are deep tunnels , hampstead station for example is 60m underground , these are the old tunnels , they are the ones with issues , at that depth ventilation is a massive problem and a lot of stations only use lifts , so its not even as if air can get up where the escalators are . 
  they ca n't put air con in the trains , because that would heat up the platforms too much , in 2006 it was 47c on the northern line , that 's against eu working regulations hot , not to mention how humid it gets down there , they ca n't just stop the underground though , the entire city would be screwed , so they just put police everywhere and handed out water bottles , there were still lots of stories about people passing out though . 
  will be interesting to see what they do , if we get another heat wave . 
  edit : an additional point based on one of your later posts , no one in the uk ( or indeed the rest of northern europe ) has air conditioning in their homes , so heat waves can result in more deaths , particularly for the elderly who ca n't get outside easily . 
  also , you need to take relative humidity into account , i can go to southern spain and walk around in 38c heat and be hot , but ok , however due to the dry climate you would experience the same level of heat in about 32 in the uk . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.campology.ca/campologist_talk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/heatindex.gif ) is a chart to explain . 
  wow , just wow . 
  its ok , orangered, 
  i 'm kind of biased , for me any city where you 're less than an hour from some of the worlds best skiing * and * surfing would have to be incredibly horrible for me to think its anything other than heaven . 
  well i always thought it must be that , but churchill in canada is exactly the same and that is only at the same latitude as the shetland isles , they do have snow 9 months of the year like the arctic and its damn remote . 
  so i 'm not sure . 
  really ? 
  are you american ? 
  the only people i 've ever met who think vancouver is anything other than amazing are americans , and i 'm 99 % positive its because they 're jealous . 
  vancouver is astoundingly awesome , yes there is poverty , yes there are drugs , but its hardly a ` huge problem ' . 
  and it has arguably the best location of any western city on earth . 
  add to that the low crime rate and fantastic standard of living enjoyed by the majority of people who live there . 
  i 've spent a fair bit of time there , and i 've travelled long term all over north america and europe , and the only place i 've ever been/lived that has made me massively think about permanently moving abroad ( i 'm from the uk ) is vancouver . 
  also , i know loads of people who live there and without exception they love it , one guy recently moved there with his wife i called him up a month or so after he moved in and he answered the phone with ` mate , i think i 've hit the fucking jackpot ' . 
  best city on earth i tell you . 
  pretty much the whole of the arctic is like this . 
  this final is going to be soooo boring . 
  i agree with a lot of the points you made in your later post however , there is no way being queen would n't be anything other than fucking awesome . 
  you can travel the world in your private jet , money is literally no object , no matter what the level of excess , in fact , having the best of everything is expected . 
  everyone would want to speak to you , you command the respect of everyone despite none of them actually knowing what you do . 
  when you want privacy you retreat to you huge estates in the countryside where you are the only people for mile around . 
  and if you get tired of being waited on hand and foot , you can always ask your waiters to stop and leave you alone , because you 're the queen , and to be honest , you can do whatever you want in private , its just that the few days of the year when you appear on camera you have to smile occasionally and wave into the distance . 
  being queen would be awesome , anyone who thinks otherwise , is just being ridiculous . 
  northern island is the same as the uk was pre-2005 off licenses are pretty unrestricted but late licenses for pubs are hard to get . 
  there is a lot wrong with drinking culture in the uk , but one thing i really like about it is that there is an off license opposite me open 24/7 and it always sells beer , so even when all the bars shut at 2am , you can still get pissed in a park ... hmm , england . 
  i do n't think its as much of a minority as you think , its just those people are quite quiet about it . 
  i do n't know if you know bruxelles well , but when i lived in london i used to be on the permanent watch for cheap tickets there on the eurostar . 
  i 'd mainly go to sit around , smoke in bars , brush up on my french and drink awesome beer - i 've been 5 or 6 times . 
  best frites i 've ever had were at [ this place ] ( http://g.co/maps/jdctm ) , its awesome because the frites are excellent and the cafe/bar across the street have a great beer selection and you can eat and drink away from loud americans and their whipped cream covered waffles . 
  i found it completely by accident when i was wandering back from the parc du cinquantenaire with some germans who were equally lost , i remember sitting in that courtyard till 2 in the morning talking for hours about how belgium is the best country in europe and i still think it is ( but i 'm sure you knew that already ) . 
  if all scotland breaks free i 'd be quite up for waiting a couple of years , until they 've run themselves into poverty , then england takes them over soft power style . 
  then because we 're no longer under the illusion of being friends we can remove all their industry , bring all the good stuff south of the boarder , and leave scotland to rot . 
  because lets be honest here , if scotland could do that to the rest of the uk , they would . 
  either that , or we just march on edinburgh and take over the country by force . 
  you ca n't spend hundreds of years being propped up by your southern neighbours , and expect things to go smoothly when you decide to cut and run .
