wait , an alcoholic ? 
  my opinion of him has just risen slightly . 
  there are few people who would * want * to be seen endorsing or supporting trump , regardless of * your * belief in him . 
  he may be an elected us president -- but 5 , 10 , 15 years down the line ... or even when you wake up the next day , you would regret it - as eventually that picture will be used against you ( e.g. 
  `` look !, 
  he shook hands with trump ! '' ), 
  there is a reason so many people look awkward or bored when they shake his hand , and i would n't do it myself either . 
  he should be behind bars . 
  how does trident belong to the us , exactly ? 
  not to mention they are built in scotland , serviced in scotland , and it would n't pan out like for an example how thatcher pressured the us & france for the exocet missiles , there is no way the us could use the nuclear weaponry from trident . 
  iirc having a chance at launching is down to the decision of the acting commander in joint decison with the queen , * depending * on the notes left on that vessel within the sealed container . 
  the us has it 's own nuclear facilities though , but it has those in other nations . 
   we dont want refugees in our countries . 
  we have seen recent terrorists attacks related to islam and we dont want to risk those . 
  this is the fact noone can change , but we dont oppose helping refugees . 
  the real refugees . 
  attacks against nations have been happening for a `` while '' , and some of the more recent attacks were fully preventable if french intel was n't broken . 
  various attacks were predicted from usa/uk intel that were handled poorly . 
  worrying about them * now * is insanity . 
  the time to worry about them is long gone , now is the time for damage prevention and control . 
  some of which is inevitable . 
  that 's not to say we should give up helping these people , but that we need to focus on other methods , and also remember to put ourselves first -- as our values are not always shared by others and will be taken advantage of . 
   i ca n't believe that you are advocating for letting humans drown if you had the chance to help them , just because you do n't want them and even receive upvotes for that . 
  he did n't mention , or even hint at letting people drown . 
  you are making some form of assumption here . 
  there were other ways to deal with the crisis , and while the methods the eu have taken have likely saved more lives ( initially ) , it will obviously be causing serious issues down the line , and the result of those issues could not just ruin the eu but entire nations depending on how these issues are dealt with . 
  there 's also the fact that we are partially to blame for the increase in the first place . 
  the rise of people smuggling will naturally occur when you make it both attractive and easier , and then cut the costs in half for the smugglers themselves . 
  north korea is to this day at a state of war , and has been at a state of war for over half a century . 
  because germany said so . 
  ^ / s joking aside , personally i think these matters should be dealt with either in the host nation , or the nearest place possible to the host nation . 
  the moment we detracted from that method was the moment it made it more attractive to make the journey in the first place , which then opened an entirely different can of worms , ultimately causing a rise in the far right ( the far right will * always * exist as a result of fear ) . 
   i do n't think its possible to be more ridiculous then this . 
  initially after cameron resigned , multiple comments were made in this sub that seemed to support the idea of `` trading '' immigrants . 
  they were heavily upvoted , and the general idea seemed to be that immigrants should be shipped like cattle into the uk as a form of punishment . 
  so you can be sure that a fair amount of people absolutely would base action from spite/anger against the uk , and economic sanctions are only the beginning of what some people * really * want . 
  if this can not be integrated with current computer systems , it could have a hidden cost , and that cost could be in the billions . 
  otherwise go for it . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of the current system anyway . 
  i have been a witness to attacks against migrants myself ( against eastern europeans anyway ) so it 's not like i 'm ignorant to the issue . 
  you have to bear in mind there are many factors to this . 
   immigration is just an easy way to get that ball rolling . 
  so the colour and origin ? 
  not really important . 
  i disagree . 
  colour and origin absolutely are important . 
  you will ** always ** have a subset of any population that is against immigration due to human nature ( e.g. 
  overactive amygdala causing fear ) , regardless of colour/origin . 
  it becomes a problem when it becomes statistically biased against a specific colour/origin . 
  to ignore it may as well be admitting defeat and letting them win -- and makes us just as bad for not bothering to understand * the real issues * . 
  in this instance , it became relevant when the polish community were on the increase , and then the bnp would specifically target them in newsletters and such . 
  that 's precisely why you have increased violence against eastern europeans . 
  it 's not like 48 % of the british woke up one morning and thought `` fuck all immigrants ! '' . 
  it 's a complex series of events that have had * decades * to grow . 
  well that 's even worse , surely ? 
  edit : to elaborate , it is useless saying `` less than a third '' of the tories wanted to leave , when a shitload of them had already left . 
   this is not how reality works . 
  if the uk `` succeeds '' in curtailing immigration , its economy will take a large hit : all the working bits of the economy depends on the free movement of labour . 
  to be fair , i 'm not sure if even the most hardcore `` brexiters '' actually care about reducing immigration as a whole -- just ones of a specific colour/origin . 
  i seem to remember even farage blabbering on about bringing over more australians/americans or whatever , something along the lines of that anyway . 
   than what is the solution ? 
  again , let them drown ? 
  that is the solution of a coward !, 
  it needed two world wars for us to realize the necessity of basic human rights , and now we should stop them because we are the superior continent , that should impose its will about life and death on other 's ? 
  that has nothing to do with strength , but is the actions of cowards and whimps that take the easy route . 
  this has nothing to do with cowardice , and everything to do with plain common sense . 
  some nations believe that aid camps in the origin nation are a better idea than forcing them to make such a perilous journey in the first place . 
  as for the present situation regarding the sheer number of people attempting to cross the sea -- it would n't have panned out this way in the if we did not make it seem so attractive in the first place . 
  in the long run -- there is no great solution . 
  the thing you can be sure of is that many people , including those in your own nation will not share your values , let alone their wealth . 
  there 's also the issue that the weight of all of this can not be measured in money or values alone . 
  you will naturally increase the growth of the far right over time , and the outcome of that could be far worse . 
  with all the salt being passed about it would n't surprise me . 
  the uk would have had a much better chance of remaining as well . 
  there is no way leave would have had a 4 % advantage if it were not for the fact in the weeks and months before the vote it was a german leader on british tv screens appearing like she was dictating british immigration * while looking incompetent * . 
  it merely reinforced the idea of `` the germans are telling us what to do '' in many , and allowed british media to play on it . 
  farage already had his fans , many others were indecisive and this is often the argument i see . 
   i feel sometimes unwelcome here in the uk ... may i ask where , and why ? 
   some of your newspapers actually fueled islamism in france . 
  not doubting this , but the ramifications of the french ignoring british intel constantly was just as bad if not worse . 
  your nation was warned of various attacks and yet the information was not handled properly at all . 
  you can not blame us for increased attacks on your nation when we were actively ignored while trying to prevent them , or being roadblocked by the poor intelligence network that existed and continues to cause issues . 
  you have to also bear in mind brexit absolutely would not have happened if it were not for fear of immigrants -- and merkel was on every tv network announcing her plans for * increasing immigration * ** before the vote ** . 
  if she had left it until after i honestly believe brexit would have been impossible . 
  brexit happened because of fear , and for most it was merely a protest vote . 
  the petition to have another referendum was started by a leave voter for christ sakes . 
  now a lot of people will say `` lol idiot ur blaming brexit on the eu ?? '' . 
  except thats not what i 'm saying at all , i 'm saying it ** influenced it ** , and drunks like farage took advantage of the situation to make it even worse . 
  merkel has likely achieved more in terms of growing the far right than farage did in his * entire career * , as farage was a man of drunken words and merkel was a woman taking action . 
  was n't the argument by the leave campaign that they want to ( presumably ) reduce trade with the eu and increase in other ( commonwealth/us/china ) places ? 
  ** edit ** : i am not saying anyone wanted less trade with the eu * specifically * , hence the ( presumably ) . 
  it would be a side effect of trading with other nations . 
  i should have worded that better but i 'm on medication and a little out of it as it is from 3 solid days of excruciating back and chest pain . 
  i 've met enough coked up psychopaths , have witnessed and documented violence , and i have stood in court as a witness for crimes that most people would have nightmares about , and have seen both the faces of those that have passed , and those that have killed . 
  at this point i 'm starting to think i 've met enough people for one lifetime -- although i 'm still very much in active treatment for some of the fucked up shit from the past . 
   so yeah -- i imagine my opinion is going to be different , however the idea we 're going to all be fine and dandy as a species with a wonderful world government in 100 years is imo delusional and even dangerous -- and if people actually have this belief then i would argue * they need to go out and see some really grim parts of the world * to gain a more realistic opinion . 
   you are categorically wrong . 
  humans tend to only be violent in times of stress . 
  fighting over resource and such like , we do n't fight simply due to it being human nature . 
  we are a social species , we have to be able to get along .
