  we have killed each other * as sport * for thousands of years , people literally brag about killing people in the year 2016 because [ insert religion/belief/other here ] . 
  i do not believe the idea we only fight over resources alone . 
  we fight for entertainment and for various reasons as a species that are beyond this conversation . 
  short of purging half the planet of those with varying beliefs -- you will never have a world government that accepts * and represents the people * for the entire human species . 
  we are just too varied . 
  ** i 'm not disputing the idea we have to be able to get along and are a social species at all ** ( as i said , '' ... infact i would argue it is human nature to eventually destroy your neighbor , ** if ** your survival depends on it '' ) but we only do so up until the moment it suits * us * . 
  to take a basic example , in this very sub alone people are hoping for the destruction of the uk for example , and want suffering for the individuals within it ( see many of the comments on this sub ) . 
  how can a global government or even peace possibly exist when people have a * desire * to see suffering ? 
  it can not . 
  i 'm being * slightly * pessimistic . 
  if i were actually being pessimistic , i 'd have gotten more into how entire pedophile rings exist , slavery rings , how your government does n't give a single shit about any of them ( or does , depending on the nations requirements at the time ) , and how these things exist today , ** and always will exist and always have existed ** . 
  the world changing does n't somehow magically make the world a less violent , more collaborative place . 
  if anything change creates divide -- and division creates even more violence due to fundamental parts of the human mind that ** are n't changing ** . 
  holy shit your not joking ? 
  first of all i sure as hell hope the entire globe never has a singular government . 
  it 'd be an absolute nightmare and would drag the world to its knees due to the opposing forces within -- all the while giving others * even more power * !, 
  secondly , and i hate to sound negative -- but short of some form of technological and biological innovation that removes violence , jealousy , all the way down to modulating adrenaline , among other innovations that we may be unable to possibly predict ... the world will always have a desire to destroy itself . 
  humans would , if left to their own devices , wipe each other from the planet given the chance , and possibly will if we do not leave soon enough . 
  10,000 years ago we had people killing each other for bear skins , today we have people killing each other for iphones and virtual pokemon . 
  human beings will never fully collaborate with each other as one being -- infact i would argue it is human nature to eventually destroy your neighbor , if your survival needs require it . 
  that 's not to say we should n't try and get along as a species . 
  just do n't be surprised if in a hundred years we are not fighting over * barrels of oil * , but over * barrels of water * . 
  ** edit ** : just to clarify , i 'd love global peace but not a singular government . 
  also ... 
  within moments of writing this post a terrorist attack happened in belgium ( three police officers stabbed ) and a woman was beaten to death over pokemon go ( another case ) . 
  instead of sweeping violence under the rug , admit it exists and maybe in time the human species will actually get somewhere . 
  we have differences . 
  we are human . 
  * instead of this endless belief that the next generation will have peace . 
  how will a british person be prevented from gaining a sim in the eu , or does op actually mean the uk ? 
  ... and if the uk already has it , why not just say `` except the uk '' or leave it out entirely as it has no relevance , other than circlejerking ? 
  there 's a difference between making a substance fully illegal , and making it illegal to buy for a certain age range . 
  however it is still not ideal . 
  the ultimate way to deal with such an issue is to make it incredibly undesirable to do . 
  like bleach . 
  the uk has n't even left yet , and the eu wants to kick out another member ? 
  as if the growing divide and the rise of the far right was n't bad enough . 
  i fail to understand how a wall will have any positive impact . 
  you climb in trucks earlier ( as most already do ? 
  ) , and the rest are pushed towards using floatation devices or people smugglers , that will then also have the effect of distributing the problem , no ? 
  six teenagers `` in a gang '' have been arrested in connection . 
  hopefully that `` gang '' will be dealt with , but this article does little aside from providing speculation . 
  gang crime exists , and likely will always exist . 
  people in gangs have a tendancy towards being racist . 
  statistically you 're more likely to be attacked for being pakistani , but we will not be reporting on a single one of those cases in this sub that has happened this week because reasons . 
  my comment was unfortunately deleted by the mods for linking to rt. 
   i 'm not the one claiming they said anything either way . 
   for you to say `` according to russia '' you need a source . 
  it 's no use saying '' * well * , according to russia ... ... find me a source that proves otherwise ! '', 
   but yeah , rt reports on civilian deaths and they are partially state owned ...  there are hundreds of links ** from rt alone ** available , largely anti-us based but yeah ...  here is one of * hundreds * .

  that 's precisely why i used rt. 
  its the closest you will get and theres absolutely nothing but your own opinion backing your own claim . 
  until then it 's not `` according to russia '' if they havent even said anything , and asking for sources that prove otherwise would be worthless as it is you making the claim .

  source ? 
  i mean i know putin and his clan get up to some mischief but i 'm calling non-offensive bullshit .

    merkels open door policy is what led to brexit imo . 
   yes , sure . 
  did it ever occur to you or your countrymen that the story of `` millions getting eu citizenship and coming to the uk '' was an even bigger lie than the 350 mil for the nhs ? 
  absolutely , lies from every side . 
  however the majority of people do not understand trade deals and other issues and voted on the fear of immigration . 
  once merkel decided to keep the ball running we were obviously fucked . 
  nobody wanted to vote remain knowing we were actively being ignored . 
   the uk might have voted for brexit because a significant portion of britons believes in fantasies . 
  it is a bit rich to blame merkel for appearing in that fantasy . 
  no it is not . 
  the vote was swayed by a very small percentage . 
  it 'd have been absurdly easy to win/remain if it were not for the immigration fears that were justified . 
  farage already had his voters . 
  merkel managed to shift the votes of many in the leading weeks alone , and if people are unable to realize that merkels decisions are a direct cause of the rise of the far right -- then they are blinded . 
  merkels open door policy is what led to brexit imo . 
  months before the vote , allowing millions of immigrants to flow . 
  ** knowing ** that integration problems would exist and i presume knowing that it 'd cause a change of opinion but perhaps not quite enough to sway the vote . 
  people here feared the choices the eu were making and wanted to curtail it and suspend it temporarily . 
  instead at that exact time , merkel did not admit the issues . 
  she kept on with her plan , but in doing so it solidified brexit . 
  it allowed fear to win due to uncertainty . 
  the worst part is , the uk authorities were the ones catching a lot of extremists and warning other nations of impending attacks . 
  but everyone of us was just presumed to be racist ( i was actually a remain voter that may well regret it someday ) . 
  it will be interesting to see how security evolves in the eu as a result of it all , as afaik france is only just starting to share intelligence efficiently . 
  before that warnings were made that could have prevented attacks in the eu but were ignored . 
  there is no way in hell brexit would have had majority if it were not for merkels actions and i blame merkel and the decisions made by the eu in the months leading up to the vote , as it did more damage than farage managed to do in * his entire career * . 
  that would presume the scottish want freedom of movement and do not fear it instead . 
  because regular terrorist attacks by islamic extremists could n't possibly have any influence on people with regards to a perception of future stability !, 
  especially when those people are being told `` tough shit '' by a woman trying to save face , actively ignoring the advice of her own people and of the intelligence services !, 
  british intelligence agencies would often be ignored and any calls for limiting the flow of immigration or merely suggesting that integration would be an issue were just met with `` you 're all racists '' even though the far-right groups emerging around the eu as a result of merkel 's instabilities make groups like the edl seem left wing in comparison . 
  meanwhile merkel is still determined to ignore the clear warnings prevented with regards to security and integration , the far right will continue to grow and grow as well after each attack . 
  it is a recipe for disaster . 
  mail it directly to the cunts door . 
  with a side order of democracy .
