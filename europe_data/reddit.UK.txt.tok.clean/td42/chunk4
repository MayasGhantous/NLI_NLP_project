  the difference was the nationality rarely played a role in the headline . 
  i have no doubt an in increase would have occurred , and anyone resposible for such attacks should be punished ... but please dont blame or accuse us all . 
  some of us love you and fight * for * you . 
  only a complete fucking dipshit would ever attack a polish person for being polish . 
  end of story . 
  * edit : * plymouth ? 
  do n't judge a house by its garbage can . 
  nations do not have friends , they have interests that change over time . 
  internet and reddit . 
  nothing could possibly go wrong . 
   it 's not just that , there 's also trump being a buffoon ~ ~ and handing the fake check . ~ ~ ... would have been fine . 
  freedom is being dispatched to turkey as we speak !, 
  i 'm not surprised about that . 
  although i am confused as to why nations * outside * the eu will have more access than us despite contributing less . 
  wait until skynet becomes self aware ... we wo n't need galileo !, 
  / s ^ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/skynet_ ( satellite ), 
  if you are going to put this down to `` we have been invaded by other subs '' when one of the most tolerant nations just left ... 
  i 'd say you were wrong/blind . 
  for the record i do n't think muslims should be banned at all , as it would achieve nothing aside from giving more power to extremist propaganda . 
  the most intolerable nations are still present in the eu and , shockingly to many , the uk was one of the most tolerable . 
  it should wake people up to some of the crimes that happen in poland/bulgaria towards blacks and asians . 
  it wo n't though , and people will still have this strange view that the uk is racist , meanwhile denying the unfolding nightmare of attempting to integrate migrants many of which do n't stand a chance into places that are far more intolerable . 
  you would be very surprised considering some of the comments i have heard regarding how `` they '' ( non-white ) are treated in ** some parts ** of bulgaria/romania/poland . 
  of course ... people will just deny it is happening , state that the uk is racist , define me as a racist and then blindly continue to think this violence does not exist in these countries . 
  we 're out now . 
  nothing i can do about it , but the eu needs to wake up if they think we are the only violent or most racist place otherwise there is going to be more and more increased incidents and people will act surprised just as they did when brexit/trump won . 
  uh , an anti-british sentiment has always existed in the eu . 
  it has only grown over time . 
  reflect over some of the comments regarding `` shipping migrants '' as `` punishment '' before brexit happened on this very sub if you want to see some of the darker/stranger shit . 
  not to mention the constant `` britain always wants x/y/z , even though they already have concessions for a/b '' which are in literally every thread regarding brexit , and always existed before brexit -- ** which you yourself ** have just mentioned . 
  we were never `` just one of the 28 nations of the eu '' , and * that 's the problem . 
  * we were always on the fringe of the eu often causing shit . 
  pretty much anyone on this sub will explain how we wanted more , and how we wanted out-out 's , how we slowed down eu progression -- ** and they are right ** , but they did n't just start caring because of brexit . 
  i 'm not saying we were hated before brexit like we seem to be now , but we always treated the eu differently , we expected different treatment , and for that the eu ** rightfully ** treated us differently and for that eu citizens have a reason to have a dislike of the uk . 
  let 's not pretend this began with brexit . 
  because it absolutely did not . 
  unfortunately however it is the people left fighting to keep the eu that end up getting bitched at and insulted , as the leave voters left this sub a long time ago . 
  remain voters like me are stuck with it the same as americans are stuck with trump . 
  it 's not really news if it 's been obviously on the horizon . 
  is a range ok ? 
  12 hours to 8 years . 
  the man is so unpredictable anything could happen . 
  the umbrella corporation, 
  i do n't think the majority of the eu * want * us to suffer . 
  however ultimately it is a requirement , regardless of desire . 
  both sides lose in brexit , but one must ultimately lose more . 
    europeans insulting brexit supporters  you surely mean the other way around right ? 
  because us europeans did n't care one bit about british politics untill we start noticing insults against poles and all the bs that followed . 
  the bnp ran with anti-polish propaganda . 
  nobody in britain listens or cares for the bnp , and i do n't think ukip ever ran with anything against polish * specifically * afaik . 
  there 's been a lot of news regarding increased attacks against people of all nationalities post-brexit , and as the polish far outnumber any other migrant nationality it can be expected they will receive the most problems . 
  one thing for sure however is that we brits were always viewed as love/hate by the majority of the eu way before brexit . 
  the idea we were not insulted until poles were attacked is a joke . 
  people were insulted for being british long , long , long before brexit . 
  if it 's of any comfort , every right wing attack i have personally witnessed in the uk had nothing to do with nationality . 
  when you 're actually dealing with violent people usually it 's because they were `` foreign '' , there 's no care for specific nationality , ** unless ** it is a targeted , organized attack ... which is n't the usual mo for bnp/ukip fans . 
  a simple statement like this could have probably swayed the results of brexit . 
  3-5 years ago some of the top headlines were , * for example * [ `` uk seeks to lead the world in providing aid to syria '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1lnr54/in_lieu_of_military_intervention_britain_vows_to/ ) ( others exist regarding libya , i 'm on mobile at the moment so would rather not go dig up loads of past links . . ) today we are all mocked/defined as racists for a ridiculous referendum that should have never happened , of which the results would have been very different if simple statements like this were used . 
  instead they are used * after * we leave to presumably prevent other nations from thinking the same thing . 
  all of which are 100 % impossible according to the majority of opinions on this sub , which leads me to wonder why bother with so little so late . . why bother with this specific action now ? 
  it seems so small now and yet if this were flooding murdoch 's papers before brexit it 'd have been very different * and * had an actual point to it . 
  ca n't believe this is upvoted . 
  the us is not an enemy because they have a shitty leader who is mainly just a broken mouthpiece in office for a short while ( comparatively ) . 
  i disagree with pretty much everything op / trump believes but is n't what happened in ukraine evidence that nato is n't the solution for the modern world ? 
  people in this sub have been adamant that the french and netherlands will be fine , and that the rise of the right can not happen under any circumstances . 
  so if professional redditors are to be trusted , nothing can go wrong . 
  ... yet i feel like i 'm watching trump/brexit again , both of which were deemed impossible . 
  so as an eu federalist is this your attitude to convince the scottish ( who were largely remain anyway ! ), 
  to join if they get independence ? 
  christ . 
  if that 's the case we really are all fucked , be it the uk or any eu state . 
  nations do not have `` friends '' they have interests that change over time . 
  if a true eu federalist such as yourself views the world in this way , then it does n't exactly inspire hope or competence in the eu ... 
  indeed . 
  i was under the impression gb invaded every nation possible at some point or another . 
  ... but according to farage , poland invaded us !, 
  anyone have a mobile friendly video link ? 
  given you can get around this with a car it is pointless . 
  the only situation this would have use is the uk , but we were already doing it , people complained about it , our concerns were ignored , and 54 % of our people were then defined as racists after a protest vote . 
  fighting 2016 and coming out with only a cold merely proves she is , for the most part ... immortal . 
   people 's fear of immigrants is starting to threaten the eu and european unity . 
  fear * started * that * five years * ago . 
  brexit , and to some extent trump are both examples of it . 
  it 's not * starting * to threaten the eu . 
  it * is and has been * for years . 
  the somewhat justified fear is made worse for an already split populace by juncker . 
  i voted remain , mentioned exactly this risk before and after brexit , and pointed out the ** glaringly obvious ** risks . 
  `` racist leave voter bla bla '' , and a shitload of downvotes to go with it . 
  people seem to think attacking both sides was a good thing . 
  then trump won in the us . 
  some people want to live in a bubble of safety . 
  that is all fine up until the point it becomes damaging , and it would seem to me that 's exactly what is happening . 
  one sided i make it out to be ? 
  ... you are intepretting something wrong here , as i would argue my nation has always been causing issues in the eu . 
  it was still stronger with us , and ultimately i think that balance was good , and pushing for reform would have been even better . 
  i am not glad at all !, 
  i voted remain with the idea of reform . 
  i do n't get the benefits of trump or brexit anymore than you do . 
  both are ... insanity for the most part . 
  imo a uk in the eu was a much better idea , and would have made a stronger eu .
