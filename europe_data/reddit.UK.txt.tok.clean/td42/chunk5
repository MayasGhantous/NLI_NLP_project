  now we will all have to deal with a weaker eu , and in my case a weaker uk . 
  however i should point out most of the brexit voters i know personally were doing it in `` protest '' , which makes sense considering it was an * advisory * referendum . 
  that 's just my personal experience though . 
  now , chances are i 'm going to be insulted for knowing brexiters as a result of even saying this -- and so the cycle of needless hate continues . 
  i fully understand why people in the eu would be angry , but as that anger continues it just alienates people - brexit and trump are a prime example . 
  i imagine most actual brits have left this sub entirely . 
  i pointed out the eu was in danger in the future * just yesterday * , and that all of this was obvious as hell . 
  the replies ? 
  `` we 're glad you are leaving '' . 
  people do not want rational discussion , especially considering you are often blankly hated in this sub if you are british/american because of brexit/trump . 
  i voted remain specifically for eu reform . 
  ( and common sense ) we ( both sides ) were screaming for reform . 
  instead you had silly stunts like merkel on every tabloid with headlines like `` merkel invites another 2m immigrants ! '', 
  * after * cologne and * before * the vote . 
  i mean jesus christ , what were people expecting ? 
  anyone putting any argument across was branded , put into a box , and ignored . 
  the left caused brexit and trump to ultimately win . 
  both were small margins that could have been avoided . 
  if people in the eu are only starting to question this ** now ** -- then we are ** fucked ** and it is merely showing how the common man was simply ignored -- and perhaps france will soon be lost as a result , and with it , the eu itself down the line . 
  meanwhile , after trump and brexit shit like a fucking [ * marshall plan for africa * ] ( http://mobile.reuters.com/article/iduskbn1361kn?il=0 ) is proposed which we do not have money for in the first place !, 
  this will surely convince the french !, 
  which one , america , uk , or the eu ? 
  they 're all in a bit of a sticky situation right now . 
  if a french leader said something like this * before * brexit and appeared to be attempting to address the issue , there 's a good chance the uk would still be in the eu . 
  some in europe are far worse than farage already . 
  they 're just not in the media , and this sub tends to ignore them . 
  yeah , this is something people would say `` oh , it 's just farage again '' . . if the french leader is only saying this now then it is not a good sign . 
  this assumes logic . 
  a lot of people hate the queen for illogical reasons . 
  `` fuck the queen , stealing everyone 's money , greedy bitch has never worked a day ! '', 
  ironically those people tend to have done much less work and are happy to hold a special brew all day . 
   i definitely wouldnt want my clients and/or day job to know my reddit account  im not misleading anyone keep telling yourself that . 
  you 're literally misleading yourself if you honestly believe that you have to keep everything you do a secret while at the same time believing that you 're not misleading anyone . 
   im trying to inspire them by bragging in their face ... which works how ? 
  even if you 're telling the truth , nobody has a clue you 're even bragging because you refuse to actually tell anyone in the first place . 
  given the figures you have thrown out , you 're certainly not `` rich '' by any means either , so it seems strange to brag about wealth when you 're still miles away from it . 
  you went from making $ 5 a day , to writing code for millions of users within 2-3 years . . while regularly posting to t_d ? 
  i 'd say i was impressed , however i have a feeling you 're deliberately misleading people here . 
  as a developer myself i would n't brag about my clients visitor numbers or the money i make through them ... it 's not a solid strategy in the long run . 
  assuming any of your clients actually exist , and assuming your users are not infact just hits they deserve to know your position as you apparently have a huge sway in the industry . 
  why not share some of your clients here if they actually exist ? 
   do majority of arm appliances run android ? 
  the majority of android devices use arm . 
  the number of devices running arm is insane and far outnumbers x86 . 
   american processor covers very well x64 . 
  x86 implies x86-64 in this context . 
  there 's no such thing as `` x64 '' , and the market of x86 ( with or without x86-64 / amd64 still pales in comparison to the number of arm based devices ... ) regardless these comparisons are silly . 
  you have to remember that the american people did not want trump , and the mistakes that trump is making are in some ways perhaps required to fix the broken system they have . 
  ** however ** , that said , i certainly would n't want to be * relying * on american companies right now as we really have no idea what will enter trumps head next week . 
  for the time being it makes absolute sense to avoid * relying * on american services/products , i do n't want to have to raise prices for my clients or something because of some dumb shit trump could pull at any moment . 
  europe has already been avoiding a lot of american things for a while anyway -- not out of `` fuck ignorant america '' but more due to the laws and regulations that america often refuses to comply with . 
  if people think boycotting will help to bring down trump , then more the power to them i guess , as he certainly does n't respond to anything else . 
  ... neither do the americans . 
  trump lost the vote and became president because of a broken political system . 
  all of these comparisons are silly , it 'd make more sense to give the romans credit and just thank them for everything . 
  there 's no such thing as `` american keyboard '' , every single component is likely made in asia , and even the language used on the keyboard itself is quite literally `` american * english * '' . 
  statistically speaking it is n't going to be an `` american '' processor as the american market mainly covers x86 , and x86 is a shrinking market . 
  arm based appliances far outnumber x86 devices and no , arm is n't american . 
  i 'm not boycotting american products myself and know many great people in the us -- but some of these suggestions are silly . 
   flown by plane ? 
  after boeing 's dreamliner failures and the rising sales of airbus aircraft i 'm confused . 
  how are planes * american * ? 
   food ? 
  most people actively avoid american food due to lack of directives that ensure safe food . 
  it 's why the eu has laws against american chicken and many other items . 
   clothes ? 
  who buys `` american made clothing '' ? 
  it 's mostly made in asia . 
   when did you use gps the last time ? 
  even american phones ( made in asia ... ) use galileo ( or glonass ) now , which is european . 
  gps itself relied on equipment made around the world anyway . 
  sony / nintendo are the first thing anyone would think and neither are american ...  pornography ? 
  europeans hate american accents ... they 're not exactly lining up for american porn . 
  even americans hate american porn . . 
  ... i already avoid all of these because they 're privacy whores . 
   qwerty keyboard is also invented in us qwerty is latin . 
  the language on the keyboard is quite literally `` american ** english ** '' . 
  a qwerty keyboard is literally the polar opposite of anything the us could possibly , in any stretch of imagination could invent . 
   internet was invented in us and majority of websites ( including reddit ) are american using this logic , the entirety of the web was invented in britain due to timbl being british ... 
  the internet is n't a singular product and can not be labelled as such . 
   x86 architecture was also invented in us . 
  99 % of processor manufactures are intel and amd that are american not sure if it was deliberately confusing , but arm is more popular than x86 . 
  x86 probably is n't even near 35 % let alone 99 % of all processors ... 
  arm is n't american either . 
  it 's a british firm . 
    german linux distro   does anyone besides german gov uses them ? 
  suse is pretty big and it 's certainly far more than just the german government using it . 
  if we 're talking about the most popular however , ubuntu is the most popular cloud and desktop distribution . 
  again ... canonical is a british company . 
  not american . 
  iirc redhat is already having issues to to the new migration crap trump is imposing so i 'd fully imagine those employees would end up in the hands of suse/canonical . 
  source for when we expanded our airspace ? 
  yeah it 's silly . 
  i lived my life in fear after diagnosed with gad/ptsd and saw some horrible things in the years leading up to it . 
  managed to document some things along the way , including the resulting illness . 
  the fear from those things eventually paralyzed me in itself . 
  the types of people that `` fear '' this are going to be entirely useless once shit * really hits the fucking * fan . 
  the people that fear this have likely never experienced any violence at all !, 
  fear will either motivate you or it 'll eventually just break you . 
  i 've documented violent incidents and was eventually diagnosed with gad/ptsd .
