i have been living in the uk for some years and i notice that the names of the streets are pretty dull . 
  they do n't name any european figure or place , or british personalities either . 
  yes , they do . 
  myabe you just recognise the people they 're named after - loads are named after major figures from the past , politicians , royalty , writers etc - e.g - and this is just one city https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_eponymous_roads_in_london and after european places - denmark hill , poland street , trafalgar square , portugal street we have great street names that are descriptive of the history of the place - again just a few from london ( because it 's where i know ) white hart lane hanging sword alley bleeding heart lane king 's bench walk savage gardens puddle dock tin pan alley appletree yard blue boar court seething lane three cranes lane lambs conduit street, 
  i grew up in dorset - [ which looks like this ] ( http://www.travelwessex.com/images/400x299xdorset-countryside.jpg.pagespeed.ic.3eohf4yody.jpg ) the archetypal ` chocolate box ` countryside part of britain is [ the cotswolds ] ( http://www.recoco.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/cotswolds-property-search.jpg ) which is a mix of quaint little villages and lush green countryside . 
  other well-known countryside areas are the [ new forest ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/5f/40/aa/new-forest.jpg ) , with it 's indigenous ponies , and the [ lake district ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/keswick_panorama_-_oct_2009.jpg/570px-keswick_panorama_-_oct_2009.jpg ) , a favourite area for hiking . 
  we think of britain as being quite built up , but in fact [ that 's a tiny proportion of the country ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18623096 ), 
  london, 
  there are youtube videos where it looks like religious police are attacking people etcetc . 
  the thing is , a 10 minutes youtube video from 4years ago does n't tell you what the context is , or what happened next . 
  there 's a youtube clip that gets posted repeatedly of 3 young men in east london supposedly acting as a muslim patrol . 
  but here 's the context - they did it for a couple of weeks before getting arrested for harrassment . 
  and here 's what happened next - they served jail time - https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/06/muslim-vigilantes-jailed-sharia-law-attacks-london when people who live there [ tell you there are no sharia-law zones ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3w00yv/redditor_makes_a_dare_to_walk_in_woolwich_uk_with/ ) , do n't believe 5 minutes of contextless youtube clips over them . 
  sweden is n't becoming increasingly violent  according to the swedish national council for crime prevention ( br\u00e5 ) , lethal violence ( murder , manslaughter and assault that results in death ) totaled 112 victims in 2015 . 
  that 's up by 25 ( a sizable increase ) from 2014 , but it 's about the same as the number in 2007 , which was 111 victims . 
  `` in a long-term perspective , ever since the 1990 's when br\u00e5 started the measurements , the trend shows that lethal violence is declining , '' as for the specific issue of rape , there was a 13 percent one-year increase in the number of reported rapes , which totaled 6,560 in 2016 , according to preliminary numbers from the swedish national council for crime prevention . 
  but that total is slightly lower than reported rapes in 2014 and about the same as the number in 2011 . http://www.factcheck.org/2017/02/trump-exaggerates-swedish-crime/ europe is n't violent , as global levels of violence go . 
  it does n't have the rate of school-shootings , or the shooting by police of unarmed people that other places in the western world has . 
  r/askuk is a thing for questions specific to the united kingdom . 
  the bbc is the best source for news . 
  the guardian is a decent broadsheet , with a left-of-centre bias . 
  the telegraph is a decent broadsheet with a right-of-centre bias . 
  avoid the daily mail at all costs , it 's worked very hard and very efficiently to get itself a ton-load of web traffic and particularly an american audience , but it is in no way , shape , or form a reliable source of information . 
  td : dr - every country does . 
  we even have it in london - there 's north vs south of the river narrative that 's the source of bants . 
  mustard here is a condiment , like [ this ] ( http://www.colmans.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/05/colmans-mustard-jar-72dpi.jpg ) you could n't use it as a spread , you use a smear as a flavouring , spread it like butter or mayo and you would n't be able to see your sandwich for your eyes watering . 
  not the sort of range you 'd see in every supermarket , but the big superstores look like that . 
  other nut butters like almond , cashew etc are becoming more popular , i can get those at my local supermarkets . 
  do n't know all those other things , but we have things that you perhaps do n't like marmite , vegemite , gentlemans relish , lemon curd , lime curd etc, 
  you should see what we get told over here about what 's happening in the usa - apparently they voted in a climate denier , who openly lies , gets his spokespeople to present lies as ` alternative facts ' , gets support from the kkk and does n't condemn them , is taking away the limited access to universal healthcare that working people had - i mean does that sound like somewhere you 'd want to live ? 
  actually , you * do * have the freedom to purchase a firearm , not all types of firearms , but you can buy a rifle or shotgun , [ you just need to get a licence and pass some basic checks ] ( https://www.gov.uk/shotgun-and-firearm-certificates ) . 
   as i mean it 's europe everyone is white the stupidity hurts, 
  very big , top olympic athletes are very well-known and well-loved , the bbc broadcasts hours and hours of events - on tv , and on the internet . 
  the paralmpics get a good following too . 
  they 're also huge in the usa , btw . 
  just because * you * only use it as wank material , does n't mean everyone else is only interested in what they can fap to . 
  [ the sex pistols - anarchy in the uk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbmws6jf5dc ) [ the clash - white riot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivg3is7bm1w ) [ the damned - new rose ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtfyuqvqx-0 ) [ buzzcocks - boredom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoyiq8qsozk ) [ xray spex - oh bondage !, 
  up yours !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fymobdoqcrg ), 
  you mean like all the ` bad teeth ' , ` sharia law ' , `` u wot m8 , i will hook in the gabber '' ` all brits are arrogant and worship the empire ' crap british posters get on reddit ? 
  roll your eyes and sigh heavily . 
  or everyone could just ignore the obvious troll, 
  we just make it up as we go along . 
  the real answer is that there re 25 documents that make up the constitution ( yes , i just checked in wikipedia ) , the earliest of which is the magna carta . 
  so , that sets the tone i guess  no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned , or be disseised of his freehold , or liberties , or free customs , or be outlawed , or exiled , or any other wise destroyed ; nor will we not pass upon him , nor condemn him , but by lawful judgment of his peers , or by the law of the land . 
  we will sell to no man , we will not deny or defer to any man either justice or right, 
  they do still happen , but i only know that because ` miss great britain ' was recently in the tabloids for being `` stripped of her title '' for having sex ( apparently ) on a reality tv programme . 
  it 's its own subculture , i think , they go on but rarely gets mass publicity unless there is a scandal, 
  there are comparatively few places on reddit to talk about europe . 
  the few there are do n't want to talk about america . 
  in the post you linked to , you said * nothing * about finland , just tried to change the subject to be about americans and american diversity . 
   i shared an american viewpoint on americans in a sub about europe , in a comment thread about finland . 
  european subs are about europe , not about america . 
  why is that so hard for you to understand ? 
  i do n't go into the new york sub and post about the buses in bournemouth . 
  i do n't go into the adelaide sub and post about the weather in cardiff . 
  i do n't go into the kindle sub and post about my iphone . 
  if you do n't want downvotes , learn about context . 
  coming to a sub about europe and posting `` you have to tell me about america , stop talking about europe '' is very annoying and happens frequently . 
  you did it there in a post about finland , and you 've started a post here about america . 
  if you 're really as interested in europe as you say , why have you never asked a question here about europe ? 
  a module on american history may be taught at a level ( ages 16 - 18 to be examined at age 18 ) , but it 's at the discretion of the school , it 's one module that the major examiners may include on the syllabus amongst 3 or 4 others . 
  reader , i married him . 
  ** better ** insist that european subs have to talk about america every day films / movies start wars jazz rap junk food ** worse ** poiicing guns politics health care parental leave and benefits workers rights, 
  http://css2.open.ac.uk/fafcalculator/elsewhere.aspx  financial support outside of the uk , republic of ireland or continental europe  we can not offer any financial support to students who live outside of the uk , republic of ireland or continental europe . 
  you may be eligible for support in your country of residence , and should contact your relevant government department for further information . 
  i read french quite well , but speak it abysmally :( i 've just signed up for an italian course , so i 'm looking forward to that . 
  the treatment of ireland and india and the whole empire building on the subjugation of other nations thing . 
  europeans think a lot less about american anything than americans seem to think . 
  and i 've nver seen or heard a reference to sjws outside of reddit . 
  in the real world where i live , being against islamaphobia , racism , bigotry , homophobia , sexual violence , and violence in general is seen as a * good * thing . 
  trump supporters , now , they 're fucking terrifying . 
  you 're always ` told ' ( i.e. 
  it says on packaging ) to wash fruit and veg , and at home i always rinse them under the tap , as others have said . 
  but when i buy an apple when i 'm out to eat - i just eat it . 
  it 's only kids that have dinner then , really . 
  most people are at work until 5 or more likely 5.30 , and then commute , so would n't even be home by 6 . 
  most ( all ? ), 
  countries have their racist idiot groups . 
  we 've got britain first and the english defence league who are nasty , stupid and often violent . 
  but they do n't define the country , they 're an ignorant minority . 
  european redditors do n't constantly go into american subreddits to insist they have to talk about france . 
  yellow roses . 
  we had big rose bushes with yellow roses in the garden of the house we lived in when i was a child . 
  whenever i see a yellow rose bush i remember being on the swing in the back garden looking down on the yellow flowers, 
  you 're just being a snob . 
  in the london sub we get a regular stream of people asking for `` the secret places that only locals know about , not where all the other tourists who are n't as discriminating as me go '' and it always gets a flood of sarcastic replies, 
  two weeks in barcelona is a true european experience . 
  it 's a place with a lot of culture and rich european atmosphere . 
  a place you 've never heard of does n't have more intrinsic value than one you have . 
  the vast majority of europeans have a longer list of `` other amazing places and people which europe '' that they * have n't * visited , than that they have . 
  as other posters have said , you 'd need a couple of lifetimes . 
  enjoying 2 weeks in paris , or in barcelona - these are enjoyable and educational things to do , not things to turn your nose up at . 
  who cares ? 
  it 's not a test , have a trip to a couple of places in europe , enjoy yourself , have some fun , it 's not an endurance sport . 
  you 'll get more out of it by picking one or two places and spending a week or more there , than trying to get from one city to another , one country to another just to tick off more boxes . 
  wtf !, 
  it 's not nationalist to call scotland a country . 
  * everybody * in the uk regards scotland as a country . 
  edit - also , so does wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scotland,
