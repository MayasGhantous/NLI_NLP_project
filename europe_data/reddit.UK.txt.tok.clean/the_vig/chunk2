  why would anyone do that ? 
  it assumes that the american south is a go-to benchmark that everyone understands . 
  outside of the usa , it is n't . 
  none of them * need * to understood , but we have very healthy teeth as a nation , due to having free nhs dental treatment up the the age of 18 ; it does n't rain all the time and we have beautiful clear blue skies in summer ; and the queen does n't make the laws and we do n't worship her . 
  and yet you 've adopted the nordic persona of troll . 
  i mean , have some self-awareness . 
  well , a lot of the bexit campaign was argued on immigration policy , and that won . 
  however , ukip has been campaigning for years against immigration * from eu countries * - very little to with `` the migrant crisis '' , lots to do with scare stories in the yellow press on romanians , poles and / or bulgarians coming over here [ taking our jobs ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2307216/britons-likely-job-east-european-migrants-findings-contrast-countries-high-immigration.html ) , [ causing a crime wave ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3615016/number-romanian-crime-suspects-arrested-surged-80-areas-18-000-nationwide.html ) . 
  apparently . 
  as to syrian refugees - it seems britain has taken in [ just over 4,000 ] ( https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-many-syrian-refugees-are-there-uk/ ) . 
  hardly a flood . 
   what part seems odd to you ? 
  that you 've heard a lot of people asking about the way americans end their calls . 
  of all the things i have never thought about or heard of ... umm ... that 's one of them . 
  they 've * all * got lovely bottoms,

  i think most europeans have at some time on reddit found themselves arguing with a teenager ( in their bedroom in somewhere like ohio who has never been outside of their hometown , let alone thir state , and certainly not outside of the usa ) , about whether or not said european is living next to a sharia law no-go zone . 
  i point you to this classic , whereby a londoner was challenged to go to woolwich openly carrying a wine bottle . 
  londoner accepted the challenge of doing something anybody would do coming back from the off licence ( liquor store ) without a second thought . 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3w00yv/redditor_makes_a_dare_to_walk_in_woolwich_uk_with/ i also often suspect the internet is making people more stupid . 
  some idiot watches 5 minutes of contextless youtube video , made 5 years ago , and thinks that 's what happens all day every day all the time . 
  ( i 'm thinking here of the clip of a so-called muslim patrol that gets trotted out when this comes up , without the context of it being 3 teenagers who tried it for a week , then got arrested for harrassment and 6 months in jail . ), 
  boringly self-obsessed, 
  one word ; rugby, 
  when i was at school we did quite a lot on the slave trade . 
  largely due to being in an area that benefited from it a lot financially . 
  the local museum does a lot on it , and a lot with schools on it . 
  this was n't exactly what we did , but this is the sort of thing they do now - https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/m-shed/learning/discover-bristol-transatlantic-slave-trade/, 
  boris johnson, 
  no , you were being told that those people * are * europeans . 
  that 's not what ` melting pot ' means , it 's actually the opposite . 
  there are 2 models of how societies treat and accept immigrants , one is the ` melting pot ' model the other is multi-culturalism . 
  the melting pot expects immigrants and the local population to become more alike , the more extreme and individual aspects of incoming culture to be smoothed out , but aspects of it to rub off on the local population . 
  multi-culturalism is when incoming people are free and able to keep their own identity and religion within their new country , and it becomes another strand of culture within that new country . 
  it 's a bit hard to address whether you think european countries should be doing one thing , when you 're actually describing the other . 
  yes , we have ice , we had [ ice houses in the 17th century ] ( http://www.parlington.co.uk/structures.lasso?process=3&amp;subprocess=struct6 ) since then we have freezers and if your freezer is n't big enough to do sufficient ice for a party , you can buy bags of ice cubes in the supermarket . 
  if it did n't taste of anything to you , did `` put more in '' not present itself as an obvious solution ?

  do you have any questions about europe that * are n't * thinly disguised rants about the usa ? 
  yes . 
  well kind of . 
  guns for sport and pest control are allowed and nobody disputes that but there is no lobby to increase gun ownership , suggesting it is a guaranteed vote loser . 
  in fact , after the dunblane tragedy , there was a successful popular movement to restrict gun ownership more than the officially appointed government committee proposals https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snowdrop_campaign, 
  england is a country that 's quite * embarrassed * by nationalism . 
  i found myself getting defensive and had to stop and think `` is it an insult ? 
  why do i feel insulted by it ? '', 
   the most nativist and nationalist not just in europe but also within the uk scotland had a referendum to leave the uk , and the scottish national party holds all but 3 of the scottish commons seats . 
  then there 's plaid cymru - the welsh national party , not as strong in the house of commons , but has a significant presence in welsh politics . 
  there is no comparable english party . 
  how on earth does that make england the most nationalist part of the uk ? 
  edit - nativism is such an unused concept in england , i had to look up what it means . 
  england is not a nativist country at all . 
  based on one person 's response , that has n't got an upvote ? 
  nowhere in the original question did ` high skilled legal migrants ' get mentioned . 
  he did n't specify skills , or that they would be legal . 
  specifying that immigrants have to have particular skills , is the most common way of * limiting * immigration . 
  but let 's look at your scenario , not the one that was originally posed . 
   if an indian vet comes to france and is better than me why should i be pissed ? 
  because you have n't got a job . 
  and if he 's coming from a country where the average annual income is 3000 euro , he 'll be delighted to get a job for 30,000 euro . 
  except that being used to a european standard of living , and a european career scale , * you * expect to be paid 60,000 euro for that job . 
  so an influx of indian vets drives down wages in your sector . 
  in reality , this does n't happen with vets . 
  in fact for many jobs in the medical field , there is a shortage that * is * made up with people from developing countries . 
  but for unskilled labour , it 's a genuine problem . 
  add a high-ish unemployment rate into the mix . 
  if you 've already got too many people chasing too few jobs , you 're not going to be keen on allowing in a whole load from other countries . 
  no personal experience of the armed forces , but i will just add that the united kingdom abolished conscription more than 50 years ago ; ( known as national service ) . 
  the last conscriptions were in 1960 , and by 1963 , all conscriptees had left the services . 
  yes, 
  it would be a case of high treason , and frankly we 'd follow the well established british constitutional procedure of making it up as we go along . 
  charles i was charged with treason , that 's a precedent . 
  get up , toast for breakfast . 
  go to work on the london underground , look at spreadsheets , get a sandwich for lunch . 
  eat it as my desk usually . 
  more spreadsheets ( i 'm looking at spreadsheets now - look - there they are ! ), 
  finish work at 6ish . 
  maybe go to a nearby pub with work friends for a quick drink and a gossip . 
  go home on the tube . 
  get home , cook dinner , last night it was chicken breasts cooked in a spicy sauce with tomatoes and peppers served with potato wedges . 
  watch some telly an some netflix , go to bed . 
  okay , it was a quiet tuesday , so not very interesting . 
  for going out there 's the ubiquitous pub , i 'm surrounded by restaurants of any number types of cuisine , probrably go out to eat most weeks at least once , but t gets expensive . 
  i 'd rather eat out less often and do it properly when we do , than do it more often and not order what i really want . 
  there 's an arts centre down the road from me that puts on comedy shows quite often that 's handy for me - they 've got ricky gervais doing a ` work in progress ' thing this week , which i did consider , but i 'm not really a fan so have n't bothered . 
   do you drive a car , a bicycle , or just public transportation ? 
  public transport  do you feel relatively safe travelling around in your city ? 
  i feel completely safe  do kids play outside a lot or do they tend to stay indoors more ? 
  in general in london kids play in parks , which there are a lot of , or their own gardens . 
  not outside in the streets because of traffic . 
  if it was that easy , it would have been happening all the time . 
  but nothing like that has happened in britain since the war of the roses , when the succession was argued and fought over anyway , and henry vi was killed in the tower in 1471 , and possibly the princes in the tower in 1483 if you believe richard iii killed them . 
  but it would always have been an act of treason to murder the reigning monarch , and punishable by death . 
  as the death penalty is not used in the u.k. and was repealed for treason in the 1990s , the punishment now is life imprisonment . 
  child support is not something to punish parents .
