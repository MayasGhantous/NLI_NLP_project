paywall . 
  so i 'm going to have to guess . 
  ^ ^ immigration ? 
  probably loads . 
  we build * really * good weapons . 
  like , the best . 
  but they were * his * missiles . 
  if a political leader in the uk had said something as fatuous as `` we 're mindful of our ties to russia '' after it had killed 189 of our citizens , they 'd be out on their arse in less than a week . 
  as it is , this mark rutte guy comes of as really weak . 
  do n't you understand ? 
  all this warmongering wo n't get you anywhere . 
  when a rogue nation starts invading and the tanks start rolling across the border all you need to do is look them square in the eyes and tell them firmly , `` do n't invade me . '', 
  does this mean we have to cancel the invasion plans ? 
  that withdrawal will kill ya ... 
  that article 's sad . 
  we should n't be allowing these countries to be such intolerable places to live and we should n't be then forcing people to live in them . 
  i 'm confused . 
  once they 're in this enclave , how do they then travel into spain and the rest of europe ? 
  surely the spanish police are watching the ports and airports . 
  i 'd have thought getting into melilla would be something of a hollow victory . 
  i think the idea is that everyone deserves a decent childhood and if afterwards they go through hell or die young then that 's too bad but at least they got the best part of life . 
  if a child dies then it strikes people as a great cosmic unfairness as opposed to just poor luck . 
  and there was me thinking that belgium is a boring country . 
  i 'm in favour of that , if only because it 'll make [ the map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/european_union_main_map.svg ) tidier to look at . 
  i can tell this map is absurd because greece has let fyro macedonia in to the eu . 
  well you should expect that . 
  historically we english have always been a bunch of bastards . 
  i do n't know much about germany but i bet there are a lot of germans who 'd get antsy about that . 
  you ca n't change a language without a load of grammar ~ ~ nazis ~ ~ junkers jumping down your throat . 
  what i do n't get is when they invent a new word like ` blog ' or ` usp port ' who gets to choose which gender it is and on what grounds ? 
  i prefer `` drizzle '' or `` dismal '', 
  the most interesting men in the world . 
  technically kazakhstan is european too , you know . 
  ( well , partially ) . 
  we 've offered them herring and fermented shark meat !, 
  what else do they want ? 
  we 're all out of ideas !, 
  atlantic-pacific union ? 
  oceanic union ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f43dqnmowi0 ), 
  it would allow us to keep pissing off the middle east . 
  is n't that we wan na do ? 
  also i 'm pretty sure the israelis are done with being bossed around by uppity , self-important europeans . 
  that sounds like it 'll step on the un 's toes . 
  pingu star alliance ftw . 
  we could let australia and new zealand join and then go around picking on the african countries for lunch money . 
  yeah , i 'm surprised how closely this fits all my stereotypes . 
  what was the intent behind posting this again ? 
  he will literally destroy the united kingdom ^ ofgreatbritainandnorthernireland, 
  it 's what makes nigel farage so dangerous . 
  apart from boris , he 's the only political figure who is actually worth paying attention to . 
   i 'm not really big on the idea of war , and with that comes my thought process that i do n't really envisage a conflict that i 'd support involvement in where the uk would be involved but france ( for example ) would n't . 
  what about defending a non-european territory such as the falklands or really any british overseas territory ? 
  the idea is not completely outlandish , thr falklands conflict was not that long ago . 
  would n't there be an issue with using a pan-european force to defend exclusively british overseas interests ? 
  and what language would the commanders give their orders in ? 
  i question how ukraine could achieve 4 . without first accomplishing 3 . 
  voting in a referendum automatically legitimizes it . 
  it 's pretty clear they do n't want to do that . 
  you 've got to admit , there 's a refreshing honesty to that ballot . 
  `` we 're not even going to pretend that we 're unbiased . '', 
  i only read the daily mail but i 'm pretty sure the romanians killed diana , raised house-prices , stole benefits and are instituting sharia law . 
  bloody hell , that 's the population of norwich . 
  i do n't want to say iceland is inconsequential but really * norwich * ? 
  `` hey do you want to wear this hat ? '', 
  `` no , thank you . 
  i do not want to wear that hat . '', 
  * makes them wear the hat anyway . 
  * `` ok now give the hat back . '', 
  `` no , it 's my hat . 
  get your own . '', 
  people forget that for a brief few months in 1917 , there was actually a chance for russia to become a democracy . 
  thank you for the contribution robert malthus . 
  swiss neutrality is a joke is n't it ? 
  they 're just offsetting the cost of an effective defensive military to their more powerful neighbours . 
  truth is , they 'd be fucked without nato . 
  in your face america !, 
  all you 've got is a fence , we 've got a moat . 
  we 'll be your cuba . 
  - britain . 
  when you 're young it feels that way . 
  we 'll probably need to keep it if we lose our favourite hat in september . 
  bnp means something slightly different in britain . 
  what the hell is up with luxembourg ? 
  i suppose we 're lucky the swiss have n't banned the free movement of subatomic particles either . 
  overly attached east germany . 
  [ guitars . 
  swiss guitars . 
  ] ( http://www.guitareuroshop.com/catalog/images/miniguitars/bfoot-miniguitar2.jpg ), 
   i wish there was a good metaphor to describe how the swiss are boring tunnels through the alps to deal with all this transit traffic . 
  i hope it 's not because we smell or something . 
  well yes , but it 's not * actually * true , it 's just a nice story . 
  otherwise japan with its aging population would n't now be in such a quandary . 
  if you guys wanted us to learn your language , you should n't have taken the time to learn ours . 
  no wonder britain is so euroskeptic . 
  all the europhiles have already emigrated . 
  the question is moot . 
  the jews would n't have accepted anywhere but israel . 
  if you 'd have tried to give them east prussia , they 'd have looked at you like : `` da fuq is this shit ? '', 
  so you 're saying in this hypothetical , iceland should stay british ?
