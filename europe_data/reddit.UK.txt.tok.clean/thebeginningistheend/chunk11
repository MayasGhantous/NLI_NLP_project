  especially his suicidal support of unilateral disarmament . 
  as well as his shaky understanding of economics . 
  but fundamentally i do n't like him because he is a weak and feckless leader of the party . 
  he is not remotely a credible future prime minister . 
  he ca n't get along with anyone . 
  he will lead labour to its worst defeat , possibly ever . 
  and he is so morally lax he 'll probably blame everyone for that defeat except himself . 
  why the confusion ? 
  that makes perfect sense, 
  i blame jeremy corbyn , he is a thick weak doddering old man who should n't be running a bingo hall let alone her majesty 's opposition .

   i 'm beginning to wonder if the steretype of the `` little englander '' does n't have merit to it . 
  ya think ? 
  in the real world if someone sprays someone else with a hose they 're fair game to have their teeth kicked in . 
  well , i saw a bunch of angry fishermen and their weaselly hypocritical backer hose down a bunch of young people for disagreeing with them . 
  if they had any true conviction about their pro-immigrant stance i would n't be calling them spineless . 
  as it is they act duplicitous like a guilty dog trying to hide the fact it just barfed behind the sofa . 
   geldof  establishment must have missed that cabinet appointment . 
  me three but i subscribe to / r/cyberpunk , so tbh my taste is probably pretty tacky, 
  well , a lot of very bad shit has been going down with muslim immigrant populations in the west in the last twenty years . 
  can you really blame them ? 
   many have a legitimate claim to asylum * some * have a legitimate claim to asylum . 
  and they are perfectly free to make their case at any european embassy on any continent in the world . 
  no reason they have to do it in person . 
   well , our galactic leader tayibion erdorg will give citizenship to syrians in here for arabizing us more . 
  there 's always a bigger fish . 
  [ not just because of cheap labour . 
  our landmass literally has a bloody moat . 
  all you need is a functioning shore-monitoring system and a polite but firm coastguard to turn human smuggling boats back . 
  the problem has always just been a refusal to collaborate and the absence of any political will by our spineless elites . 
  we could just veto it you know . 
  we 'll never go * hungary * again !, 
  it shows the sheer power of concentrated memery . 
  i think the decorum is to start passive aggressively tidying up around them until they take the hint . 
  he really is an awful horrible no-good labour leader . 
  meanwhile the great russian orca looms off the starboard bow and the massive kraken known as `` impeding financial crisis '' lurks in the stygian depths directly beneath . 
  i 'm british . 
  what do you think the prime minister is ? 
  no , the guy is the absolute fucking worst . 
  in an open and democratic eu this guy would be managing a supermarket . 
  the fact that he even managed to become president of luxembourg is a stinging indictment of luxembourg 's democracy . 
  hate on farage all you like , i certainly do , but at least he does n't treat the european public with open contempt . 
  ** on greece 's economic meltdown in 2011 ** `` when it becomes serious , you have to lie '' ** on eu monetary policy ** `` i 'm ready to be insulted as being insufficiently democratic , but i want to be serious ... 
  i am for secret , dark debates '' ** on british calls for a referendum over lisbon treaty ** `` of course there will be transfers of sovereignty . 
  but would i be intelligent to draw the attention of public opinion to this fact ? , '' ** on french referendum over eu constitution ** `` if it 's a yes , we will say ` on we go ' , and if it 's a no we will say ` we continue ' , '' ** on the introduction of the euro ** `` we decide on something , leave it lying around , and wait and see what happens . 
  if no one kicks up a fuss , because most people do n't understand what has been decided , we continue step by step until there is no turning back . '', 
  ** on eurozone economic policy and democracy ** `` we all know what to do , we just do n't know how to get re-elected after we 've done it '' * prime ministers must stop listening so much to their voters and instead act as `` full time europeans '' , according to jean-claude juncker . 
  elected leaders are making life `` difficult '' because they spend too much time thinking about what they can get out of eu and kowtowing to public opinion , rather than working on `` historic '' projects such as the euro , he said . 
  * * the british people will be treated as `` deserters '' following a vote to leave the european union , jean-claude juncker has warned . 
  in his greatest intervention in the referendum contest , the president of the european commission said that the uk would face `` consquences '' and be treated as a `` third country '' following a break with the eu . 
  the remarks were denounced as `` intimidation '' by leave campaigners . 
  `` i 'm sure the deserters will not be welcomed with open arms , '' mr juncker , a lifelong european federalist , told le monde . 
  yep , but democratisation has to be pushed through , or it shall end up being the cross the eu is nailed to . 
  how about by eu institutions actively engaging with the public rather than sneering down at them from their ivory tower ? 
  forget farage , geert and le pen : jean claude-juncker has always been the single best advertisement for the eurosceptic parties . 
  `` sovereignty '' is whoever possesses the nuclear launch codes . 
  everything else is just words and words are wind . 
  yes, 
  here are the bare facts of the british electorate : 30 % are tweedy xenophobic bastards . 
  30 % are guardian-reading soft-headed lefties 30 % are so ignorant they do n't even know there 's a referendum happening 10 % are flaky economically-illiterate credulous morons who are as likely to vote based off of the headline of the sun on the day in the question as any of the actual facts . 
  this is why we will unfortunately be coming out . 
  normally i would agree with you . 
  but voting brexit is so financially irresponsible that it really just damns them even further in my eyes . 
  not only are they going to push us into an artificial recession but not even they will be better off from it . 
  ffs it 's like they 're taking their cues directly from the comments section of the guardian website . 
  life becomes so much easier when you do n't have to think through your arguments logically . 
  wait , so france feels important now ? 
  the 120 days of sodom ? 
  [ maybe this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhood00snju ), 
  stay in england for a good old fashioned british seaside holiday . 
  ] ( http://www.moodiereport.com/martin/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/rain.jpg ) it 's your moral duty as a soggy patriot . 
  it 's not really the moral hypocrisy i do n't understand as the actual foolhardiness of the venture . 
  we all remember that time when osama bin targaryen flew hijacked dragons into the two towers . 
  the eleventh of michaelmas , never forget . 
  basically if your local underground station is overground then you 're a pleb . 
  a comment beating up a strawman beating up a strawman beating up a strawman . 
  we have reached peak recursion . 
  ok then i 'll define it for you : the human spirit is that part of yourself which can not be nourished by mountain dew and cheetos alone . 
  do n't act deliberately obtuse . 
  it 's unbecoming . 
  yes , keynes did say something along these lines . 
  but law of diminishing returns means if you kept on redistributing wealth it would very quickly start to become a net drag on the economy rather than a boon . 
  i do n't think we should ever implement it . 
  it 's fundamentally antithetical to the human spirit . 
  necessity causes discomfort but it also drives adventurism , curiosity , industry , temperance and wisdom . 
  yes i believe society does have a basic responsibility to care for everyone . 
  but that should n't just extend to physical care , but also helping people discover their own strength of character . 
  young people for instance , should never be given free money . 
  make them volunteer , help out in the community , develop their own skills , make them work for their income . 
  anything . 
  and what exactly do you about the people too vulnerable and mentally incapable to be left in charge of their own finances ? 
  people only seem to support basic income for ideological reasons . 
  they must realise it would be terrible for the economy . 
  this is the sultan of all butthurt tantrums . 
  what a twat, 
  hopefully this will be the straw on the camel 's back that destroys that odious eu-turkey agreement . 
  [ not .
