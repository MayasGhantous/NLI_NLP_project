  [ ending the ` europe \u00e0 la carte ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqasvlglely ) it 's pretty much a succinct roadmap to fixing all of the current eu 's problems for the foreseeable future . 
  but it 'll never *** ever *** happen . 
  because of the entrenched special interests who gridlock all progress for their own ends . 
  this is the real cancer eating at the heart of the european project . 
  greed and self-interest . 
  with one of the primary agents of this stagnation being the national governments who always *** always *** put their short-term interests first . 
  roadblocking all conceivable progress in the name of expediency . 
  fair enough . 
  it would be a monroe in reverse then . 
  exactly like the chinese . 
  they stay in their fucking lane . 
  their militarism is exclusively in their backyard . 
  continental neutrality . 
  it could be a new thing . 
  you leave my continent alone , i 'll leave your continent alone . 
  people do n't want an active , interventionist military superpower . 
  they just want iran and russia and isis to fuck off and leave them the hell alone . 
  a border-guard superpower . 
  a guarded city-on-a-hill . 
  build a wall through istanbul and make the middle-east pay for it . 
  that 's all . 
  even if they pull it off the seabed it 's not like they can put it in giant bag of rice and reuse it . 
  not worth the trouble i imagine . 
  this is not / r/subredditdrama , get this circlejerk out of this sub . 
  1914 , 1939 , 1940 and 1941 beg to differ . 
  [ `` the economic interdependence between industrial countries meant that war would be economically harmful to all the countries involved . 
  moreover , if a conquering power confiscated property in the territory it seized , `` the incentive to produce [ of the local population ] would be sapped and the conquered area be rendered worthless . 
  thus , the conquering power had to leave property in the hands of the local population while incurring the costs of conquest and occupation . 
  '' [ 3 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_great_illusion ) - the great illusion , 1909, 
  identity-politics is a hell of a drug . 
  it 's also painfully obvious that any plan of ambitious wealth redistribution ca n't work alongside mass immigration . 
  imagine the economic disaster policies such as universal basic income and open borders would happen in conjunction with each other . 
  you 'd literally been handing cash to people walking in through the front door . 
  the right and libertarian fringe are much more consistent on this issue . 
  also the safety considerations of levees holding back billions of gallons of seawater to protect millions of people in the reclaimed areas . 
  what sort of failsafe could you possibly rely on to prevent a catastrophic failure ? 
  greatest engineering project accomplished in human history just to reclaim several hundred square miles of briny inhospitable marshland . 
  no thanks . 
  good . 
  someone needs to be picking up the slack for western civilisation . 
  making us the white walkers presumably . 
  let 's all go back to our shit-stained rocks and stay there . 
  the old testament has already been reinterpreted . 
  thousands of years ago by the new testament . 
  which is why it 's okay for christian to eat pork and shellfish . 
  the problem of the qur ` an is there is no equivalent of the new testament that tells you to forget all that bullshit that came before . 
  in fact within the qur ` an it tells you that there can never be anything that follows after , the qur ` an is the final and definitive set of rules set by god until the end of time . 
  the kurdish population of kirkuk is approximately 48.2 % so do n't count on it . 
  right of conquest ? 
  that 's democratic . 
  so who gets kirkuk ? 
  they have a lot to lose as previous iraq-kurd wars can attest . 
   would n't it be nice to have an ally in the region that is n't israel or saudi arabia ? 
  i mean there 's the nato member right next door . 
  these people seem awfully insecure about their god . 
  i think you underestimate how good syrians have gotten at killing terrorists . 
  i 'd personally buy him a first class ticket so long as he ripped up his passport when he got there . 
  you should just reorganise the states rather than the flag to make sure they always add up to 13 . 
  here are some suggestions : * state of greater dakota * the ( non-racist ) state of dixie * cascadia * great plains state of kansabraskayoming * puerto rico, 
  and they shall call it ... the eurozone . 
  since 1815, 
   what a ficticious scenario like east thrace seceding would look like in what universe would that ever happen ? 
  you just need to claim you 're gay . 
  that 's it . 
  that 's a great film full of polish war heroes . 
  they all get shot in the back of the head and buried in a mass grave . 
  but that 's history for you . 
  ones not managed , controlled or imposed by the state . 
  why does moldova even want transnistria ? 
  it 's a godofsaken shithole populated by poor angry russian commies . 
  cut them loose like a bad smell . 
  because natural communities are an enemy of collectivist statism . 
  ouch . 
  really ouch . 
  who set this to music ? 
  yes . 
  yes all that is true . 
  remind me when un starts enforcing any of this . 
  seized in war . 
  live every other country ever made . 
  it 's not a land grab if you already own the land . 
  separatists gon na separate, 
  have we tried asking the human traffickers * nicely * to stop ? 
  that 's a red card for badthink . 
  check your privilege comrade . 
  well stop being so poor then . 
   however , russia does sell weaponry to both armenia and azerbaijan . 
  that 's how you never go out of business . 
  why would armenians ever be fighting on the shore of the eastern black sea ? 
  they 're a landlocked caucuses nation . 
   not that saudi arabia is any better . 
  armenian ? 
  armenians were part of this exercise ? 
  not only that , i have some bad news : the call was coming from inside the house . 
  what england and wales can do though is declare independence from the uk . 
  it 's a really thought-provoking article . 
  it 's really asking the question : have western values gone too far ? 
  and that 's fair enough , every ideology taken to its extremes becomes toxic . 
  and no one is pulling for more of the welfare state .
