  they 're not fans of the buffet model of international relations . 
  the above poster was making the point that though they appreciated trade with the eu they did n't want to participate in the political project . 
  that sounds a lot like a switzerland-style deal to me . 
  meanwhile there 's no kind of exit from the single market which would n't hamper trade in some form or another . 
  i assumed norwegians with their export-focused economy and extensive ties to their fellow nordic countries would want to avoid that . 
  leaving the eea and leaving the single market are not synonymous . 
  you can leave the eea without being dumped into some ignominious hard-wto-norwexit . 
  i assume that 's what the norwegians against eea membership mean as cutting off 84 % of your export industry sounds a lot like economic suicide otherwise . 
  switzerland has not severed its bilaterals because it has not enacted any restrictions on freedom of movement . 
  just like norway . 
  if norway left the eea then it would be in exact same situation as switzerland would be if it severed its bilaterally-negotiated deals with the eu . 
  in all respects the two situations would be identical . 
  sure but if norway imposes movement and work restrictions on non-nordic eu citizens then the eu can and will respond . 
  this is precisely the problem switzerland encountered when they had a referendum on restricting inward migration from the eu and the swiss government 's response was to shelve the entire referendum result because they had no way to carry it out without being unceremoniously dumped out of the single market and beaching the entire swiss economy . 
   dropping out of eea or schengen will not change much in terms of fom within the nordics . 
  technically correct . 
  in order for norway to leave the eea and schengen without compromising fom it would have to : 1 . 
  allow the eu to set up passport checks at the swedish and finnish borders . 
  negotiate single market membership via a series of bilateral treaties * a la * switzerland which would have the cumulative effect of effectively remaining part of the eea . 
  but that would all be a lot of running in place just to stand still . 
   if other nordic countries drop out or the eu dissapers if it does n't though norway is up shit-creek without a paddle . 
  that 's what we call a * high risk , mediocre reward * strategy . 
  how do norwegians square their strong euroscepticism with their close relations with the other nordic countries ? 
  are people really ok with the prospect of needing a visa to work in stockholm , helsinki or copenhagen ? 
  buh muh ** sovereignty !, 
  ** muh ** freedom !, 
   it 's win , win . 
  until your populace says : `` i 'm tired of the eu holding our government back !, 
  it 's time to ** leave ** ! '', 
  `` he 's the roose bolton to our cersei lannister . '', 
   how a hypothetical ideal mfa spokesperson should have handled it how about `` we 're sorry chechnya is so shitty , we know too . '', 
  it 's the green goblin . 
  plus , the only real purpose for aircraft carriers these days are national dick-waving contests anyway . 
  the one true god is zeus and apollo is his messenger . 
  t h i c c c c c, 
  i want them here but only if they eventually go back again . 
  `` refuge '' is supposed to be a temporary state of affairs . 
  not a stepping-stone to permanent migration . 
  it 's not a conspiracy theory that isis used the migration crisis to plant operatives in western europe . 
   but thats a matter of political will and resolve . 
  it 's all part of the same depressing stew . 
  europe has no resolve . 
  it has no will to protect itself . 
  its woeful defence spending is nothing but the most obvious symptom of that . 
  it 's why autocrats like putin and erdogan feel entitled to peel chunks off europe when they feel like it like a slow-roasted hog , it 's why europe has this unfair stereotype as a weak and effeminate declining power , why radical islamists both at home and abroad become ever bolder and more ambitious with each passing year . 
  weakness and complacency oozes out of europe 's pores . 
  china does n't need to project power . 
  neither does europe . 
  it just needs to do the bare minimum to protect its own territory and defend its own people . 
  we live in the time of pax americana : liberal global free trade backed up by western institutions such as wto , imf , world bank and the un and protected by american military supremacy . 
  forget russia , europe was brought to its knees by a few thousand unarmed refugees marching across the border with outstretched hands . 
  the migrant crisis exposed the eu as weak , spineless and vacillating . 
  is it any wonder erdogan was so quick to take advantage with his crappy blackmail threats ? 
  if erdogan can do it , so can putin , or the next autocrat in algeria , libya or egypt . 
  just pack a few thousand penniless migrants into wooden fishing-boats and watch the europeans absolutely lose their shit . 
  maybe a threat like that ca n't level the great cities of europe , but you know what ? 
  it nearly put a fascist lunatic into the \u00c9lys\u00e9e palace . 
  russia does n't even need to use their military . 
  just by virtue of its existence they apply political pressure to their regions of interest , like a choke-collar wrapped around eastern europe 's neck . 
  after ww2 a soviet soldier never stepped on finland 's soil but the ussr still wielded enormous influence on finland 's foreign policy for decades by virtue of fear and veiled threat alone . 
  russia has never been the out and out villain in situations like this . 
  more the vaguely threatening sociopathic friend you always have to super nice and generous to . 
  like joe pesci in goodfellas or begbie in trainspotting . 
  china is a bad example to use . 
  they are heavily investing in their military at the moment , they 've built up the third most impressive nuclear deterrent in the world , they aggressively defend their border security and they 're basically assholes when it comes to contesting the south china sea . 
  they are absolutely not a toothless superpower . 
  well , they wo n't . 
  most of europe is hopelessly inured to this warped co-dependent relationship they have with america . 
  it lets them delude themselves that the world is made of nothing but sunshine and rainbows and armies are for fascists and dummies while it gives the us another good excuse to retain its vastly inflated military budget to serve its military-industrial complex . 
  this will all end poorly though . 
   `` civilian superpower '' i prefer the term : `` toothless superpower . '', 
  it 's more accurate . 
  this whole situation is farcical . 
  europe is the region with all the national security threats on its borders : russia , a stronger iran , isis , russia , an unstable north africa , erdogan 's rogue turkish sultanate , russia , the modern migrant crisis , russia and russia . 
  the us meanwhile only has to contend with el chapo and a few bad hombres . 
  europe should be begging the us to stay invested in europe and should be the hawkish one when it comes to defence spending . 
  but they 're not , they 're bizarrely complacent about almost everything to do with national security . 
  like a gaggle of dodos curious about the big wooden floating hills on the horizon . 
  as if they would ever marry an infidel woman . 
  they want a nice muslim girl to wed and then a white mistress or two on the side . 
  must be their fiery hellenic blood . 
   literally no religion gets attacked more than islam yes there 's a reason for that . 
  holy fuck , what a shitty comparison . 
  why do you think they 're called * roman * ians ? 
  because their entire culture and language is ultimately italian-derived . 
  no we wo n't stop bombing isis . 
  because we 're not sniveling cowards who will let ourselves brought to our knees by these murderous cunts . 
  yes but they have to struggle under the monumental burden of occasionally being called racist on twitter . 
  superior british organisation skills . 
  let 's be honest . 
  being neutral in europe these days is just convenient . 
  no defence commitments , no military entanglements , it 's the classic free-rider principle . 
  this shit is the real reason we ended up voting to leave . 
  this is really turning out to be the year of elections is n't it . 
  i did n't ask for motive i asked for evidence . 
  he 's said that . 
  i do n't buy it . 
  what evidence has there ever been that the us would extradite him ? 
  so why did he then ? 
  how can you be a turk if you ca n't speak turkish ?
