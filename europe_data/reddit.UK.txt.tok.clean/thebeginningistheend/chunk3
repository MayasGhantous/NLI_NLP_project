  i agree . 
  if you wish to censor nazi ideology then that means to some extent you fear it . 
  which means you believe it has some form of validity and rigor . 
  the appropriate response is not to get angry but to roll your eyes and laugh in its face . 
  a university is an arena of debate in which fascism is woefully under equipped to deal with . 
  anyway , universities are n't designed to teach you what to think , but instead * how * to think and the facts for you to interpret . 
  indoctrination , censorship and personal attacks are the weapons of the enemy . 
  yeah , stamp on their human rights !, 
  that 'll show those brownshirt bastards the meaning of tolerance !, 
  i think they want to draw a distinction between an amicable bilateral separation and what would happen in the event of an independent catalonia , a unilateral secession . 
  spain has said they wo n't , however .

  as soon as greece quits whinging . 
  and in the end , is n't that what really matters ? 
  this is why yanukovych will win . 
  eu is weak . 
  russia is stronk . 
  presumably that 's the neo-nazi party . 
  yes !, 
  ukraine is just the start . 
  soon there will be an east european spring . 
  from the cold waters of the baltic to the shores of the black sea , the people will gather in the streets and overthrow that evil authoritarian empire that controls them , the european union !, 
  i certainly hope not . 
  can you think of any civil war in recent years which has n't ended up being protracted and bloody ? 
  anyway the international community will be compelled to intervene before it got to that point . 
  [ america is the hero the world needs right now but not the one it deserves . 
  so we 'll blame him because he can take it . 
  a watchful protector ... or something .

  i know i should be horrified . 
  but it seems really futuristic . 
  this is n't some 80s soviet bloc nation using primitive loudspeaker technology , this is 21st century authoritarianism !, 
  what 's next police truncheons which act as wifi hotspots ? 
  riot shields with built in lcd tvs ? 
  tear gas equipped with radioactive tracers so the police can hunt you down like a dog all the quicker ? 
  this is n't 1984 anymore , this is 2084 . 
  can i ask , why exactly did russia cede so much of its territory to the ukraine in the first place ? 
  admittedly this was during the days of the ussr , but as a direct result of that , it meant russia lost a lot of its territory in 1992 . 
  sorry guys , our bad . 
  you can watch porn in britain . 
  it 's just illegal . 
  makes it more exciting !, 
  i always imagined the stereotype of eastern europeans to be either something like [ this ] ( http://cdn.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/niko-bellic.jpg ) or like [ this ] ( http://cdn.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/niko-bellic.jpg ), 
  it 's not so much that putin hates gays as much as he has a cold disdain for all things not-putin . 
  i 'm sorry what does kebab problem mean ? 
  this is the reason why i 've lost every game of risk i 've ever played . 
  well , what could we have done ? 
  just go without an empire ? 
  do n't be absurd . 
  even belgium had an empire . 
  man , russia sure are a bunch of jerks . 
  britain has some of the smallest houses and highest population densities in europe . 
  [ i googled . 
  do n't know what you 're complaining about .

  clearly a reference to the austro-prussian war of 1866 . 
  that 's the status-quo . 
  all i 'm saying is that it 's bad . 
  i think every country has an event they call `` night of the long knives . '',

  if europe is so proactive , then why do so few countries meet the minimum 2 % goal of nato ? 
  what about the two-tier solution ? 
  this is the problem with nato . 
  america feels pissed off because they feel like they 're subsidising the defense of europe . 
  europe feels pissed off because they feel like america is leading them by the nose . 
  the european union should be perfectly big and rich to take care of itself . 
  but for some reason , the political will simply is n't there to do that . 
  it 's almost a codependent relationship at this point . 
  we 're more prepared to give up bournemouth . 
  `` uk is the only european nation with any relevant military might * that actually matters * '' better ? 
  why would britain even need to be involved in this decision anyway ? 
  after all , wo n't this just involve the continental countries ? 
  it 's not like we were ever seriously going to join up and give up the desiccated remants of our once glorious imperial might . 
  we need them to protect the many worthless rocks that we own from the argies . 
  a few weeks ago they found an unexploded ww2 bomb buried a few streets away from our house in london . 
  they had to call in the bomb squad as it was still dangerous after nearly seventy years . 
  that 's quality german craftsmanship for you .

  he dun goofed now . 
  yes , but the greens are idiots .

  / r/lithuaniaspheres, 
  well , hold on there , let 's not go crazy now . 
  your sources are weak . 
  founded on a shaky understanding of the international system at the time . 
  poland , estonia , latvia and lithuania were n't just a bunch of arseholes . 
  they were independent nations who had separate governments who would have dearly loved to have bent over to the soviets in the same manner as the finnish government . 
  only they did n't get the chance , they were annexed by the soviet empire against their will by an entity with no respect for international law using a completely over-whelming military force . 
  so , what 's the version of history where finland 's continued independence was completely unconnected with twentieth-century american foreign policy ? 
  you kicked the ussr 's arse in the winter war so hard that after world war 2 it just completely respected finland 's border for the next 44 years ? 
  the soviets rolled their tanks all the way to the 38th parallel in east asia . 
  to the carpathian mountains in the south . 
  to the river elbe in the west . 
  to the baltic sea in the north . 
  they spent the cold war aggressively spreading their ideology across the world without any respect to national borders . 
  dude , the soviets did not give a fuck . 
  you know , when we brits say : `` if it were n't for the americans we 'd all be speaking russian right now '' we 're being amusingly droll . 
  but for the finns , that is actually literally true . 
  transnistria is the last remnant of the soviet union .
