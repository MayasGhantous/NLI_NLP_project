  my inner freedom lover says `` yes ! '', 
  my inner cartographer says `` no ! '', 
  personally i think it 's only fair that countries unwilling to take in more refugees should compensate by giving more aid to the syrian refugee camps in lebanon and turkey . 
  `` boots on the ground '' is a concept which is basically dead for a generation . 
  is joke . 
  immigrants do n't procrastinate . 
  you 'd better put your head down matey .

  i thought we were talking about europe ? 
  that 's not a reasonable claim you 're making . 
  that 's just a bottom-of-the-barrel ukip platitude . 
  then it should n't keep having the same currency . 
  that 's a recipe for trouble .

  i hope climate change was up there too . 
  that 's really the wrong attitude to take . 
  the eu should be a `` broad tent . '',

  so many things wrong with that sentence i do n't even know where to begin . 
   it is funny you do n't understand sarcasm so do n't even try . 
   of all people this does n't work at all , you just confused colonialism and neocolonialism . 
  which is fucking ironic as it was france that pioneered neocolonialism , the us and the uk just trailed behind . 
   does n't understand neocolonialism i do tho . 
  that 's not neocolonialism . 
   neo-imperialism is the geopolitical practice of using capitalism , business globalization , and cultural imperialism to influence a country . 
  ok , you linked the article professor bahatost . 
  what country is being influenced ? 
  not even close . 
  they do need help . 
  we should build lots of cheap foxconn-style factories in morocco and tunisia and pay them to make our iphones . 
  boom , no more relying on china and no more unemployed illegals . 
  two birds one stone .

  of course not . 
  border controls of any kind are evil , fascist , racist and have no place in our great european utopia . 
  stopping migrants ' freedom of movement is literally raping their civil liberties .

  jmisep just make it someone else 's problem . 
  ... and that super monobrow on the left . 
  2-3 % is a lot of people . 
  it 's simple logic . 
  immigrant a wants to enter europe , he applies legally , gets rejected . 
  stuck at home . 
  immigrant b wants to enter europe , he illegally crosses borders and once he arrives he applies for bogus refugee status . 
  he is deported years later or maybe never . 
  meanwhile his presence causes a reaction against further immigration and ruins immigrant a 's best hopes of getting a work visa . 
  do you think all the immigrants following after are going to follow immigrant a or immigrant b 's example ? 
  i 'm not against immigration . 
  just illegal immigration . 
  illegal immigration kills immigrants .

  please stop applying reason and logic to a situation which clearly calls for a knee-jerk , emotional reaction . 
   throw lots of money at the second-strongest land power in europe to keep them fighting the strongest land power in europe that is what preserving the balance of power is . 
  take that damn potato out of your mouth . 
  if `` perfidious albion '' is a slur which accuses us of acting to preserve the balance of power in europe , of preventing a single imperialistic hegemony to flourish in europe and keeping to a strict policy of realpolitik in europe then by all means call us `` perfidious albion . '', 
  and why do n't you call it `` perfidious eu '' while you 're at it , as they were built with the same principles . 
  hey , who switched the light off ? 
  oh , it 's back on now .

  the french just super-turbo surrendered to the danes prison-bitch style and hoped that would magically just turn them french . 
  we consistently beat the shit out of the french for a century , then we get one shitty king and the french win a couple of battles led by a psycho schizophrenic teenager and now suddenly it 's all `` oh , you lost the hundred years war . '',

  good question : what 's the difference between western europe and north africa and is it justifiable to treat both areas as culturally , politically , economically and geographically homogenous blocs with no respect paid to international borders within those areas ? 
  in regards to this ** one ** issue , i would say yes , it would be appropriate to do so . 
  there 's lots of reasons why , but for the moment i 'm just going to stick to using these four maps as reference .

  what if you fitted the border are with passive motion sensors to get a picture of how often there are illegal crossings ? 
  that would be an extremely useful thing to know .
