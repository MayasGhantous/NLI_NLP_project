  news at 10 : algerian man deported to tunisia !, 
  literally worst thing ever !, 
  `` how will i ever get back home ? '', 
  asks man who must have literally never heard of buses . 
  how did they get into europe ? 
  by boat ? 
  then they came from north africa . 
  it 's not difficult . 
  the simple fact is that if you do n't disincentive illegal immigration then you 're encouraging it . 
  allowing illegal immigrants into europe is a massive injustice to legal migrants who played by the rules . 
  [ russia 's masterplan . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eusguhhmyfk ), 
  ok , how i would fix ukraine ... 
  i would partition the country and split it between its neighbours . 
  [ i 'm going off this map . 
  ] ( http://russianwomenblog.hotrussianbrides.com/image.axd?picture=2012%2f12%2fukraine_oblasts_map.jpg ) i would give : * all oblasts east of the dnieper to russia . 
  ( soon to be czechoslovakia again . ), 
  * lyiv goes to poland . 
  * kiev goes to belarus . 
  * the rest of the country is divided between them . 
  ukraine is different though . 
  it 's always going to have hideous borders . 
  it 's the ugliest shaped country in europe . 
  it looks like a big-nosed blobfish taking a bite outta moldova with a little crimean scrotum hanging out the bottom . 
  right , because what ukraine needs right now are even ** more ** militant russian separatists . 
  not so bad . 
  [ depends on the fish . 
  is it weird that i support this just because i think it would make for a better looking border ? 
  i already copywrited this sentiment so you 're going to have to send me $ 65 or you 'll be hearing from my lawyer . 
  i meant bad political decisions eventually lead to economic crises and bad economic decisions eventually lead to political crises . 
  either way , cars are going to end up turned upside down and set on fire . 
  and today germans and greeks alike learned that politics and economics eventually boil down to the same thing . 
  it 's like cortez burning his boats if cortez was in his boat at the time . 
  in the ocean . 
  with sharks . 
  those things mean the same thing . 
  on the bright side twenty years down the line this will make a great / r/cringe post . 
  man is a wolf to man . 
  so , you 're saying we should start selling them opium ? 
  if he wanted peace he could have just stayed on elba . 
  i have n't clicked the link and i already know that 's a firefly reference . 
  you have been banned from / r/unitedkingdom . 
  the uk gets a discount but the money is taken out of the benefits the eu gives the uk . 
  the germans do n't lose a dime . 
  i suppose if you 're a french farmer you might be pissed off that we do n't pay into the common agricultural policy . 
  but the cap is a big pile of shit . 
  not when it 's about us . 
  it 's only okay to make fun of ** other ** countries . 
  bloody racist sausage eaters , we should bomb them back to the treaty of vienna . 
  do you wan na bet ? 
  gcse is a bloody doss though . 
  i had a similar experience when in conversation with a fellow from newcastle . 
  do n't worry , nobody in the uk even counts irish votes . 
  we throw them in the bin and decide seats by throwing random letters at a board until it comes up with one that 's a ni party . 
  remind me again , what did you guys do with the cathars ? 
  i said *** ideally *** . 
  i mean ideally , you should be walking every day . 
  clearly the problem is not that the nazis were racist , but that they were the wrong type of racist . 
  yeah but 50 years down the line swedes will make the best curries . 
  i just got the double meaning to that . 
  nothing wrong with it ? 
  speaking socially , economically and politically i would disagree with you . 
  it leads to unofficial apartheid and ghettoisation . 
  intergration is vital for any country with high net immigration . 
  communism was just the excuse a small number of russian mobster intelligensia used to rule most of eastern europe and asia . 
  those nazi czechs must have had pretty good aim to shoot all the way to the soviet border . 
  i would n't say so . 
  france declared war on germany because it was terrified of hitler . 
  the other countries tried to stay neutral because they were terrified by hitler . 
  the only difference was that france was a larger country and the rest were n't . 
  this comment gets dumber the more i think about it . 
  this is about heathrow not the entire us mainland . 
  i 'm sure this argument would go down a treat in the hague . 
  `` it was n't me your honour !, 
  t'was the sea , that treacherous mistress than no-man can hope to tame ! '', 
  i 've heard they 've really got a deficiency of heavy vehicles and planes at the moment . 
  if it was n't for russia no one would give a shit about belarus . 
  do n't forget to bring your friends !, 
  i 've heard poland is really on the up . 
  would you like some tea , father ? 
  ireland is like that one boy at school who hated your fucking guts for the whole year for that one thing you did on the first day back that you do n't even remember anymore . 
  every country needs two aircraft carriers . 
  are you even trying europe ? 
  of course i 'd expect a *** german *** to say that . 
  well ... it 's sorta their fault . 
  boo him !, 
  boo him , i say !, 
  i know my own people and i tell you , britain would collapse in a fortnight . 
  which one 's that ? 
  flair up dude . 
  no sense of humor . 
  finn confirmed . 
  to be fair , the fact that they 're wearing matching ties is a bit goofy . 
  maybe that 's why they changed it ? 
  `` sure , we can get rid of hitler , but what then ? 
  what if he 's replaced by someone worse , who shoots lasers out of his eyes and eats aryan babies for breakfast ! '', 
  someone 's definitely been watching `` the bridge '' . 
  do n't you mean code-name : `` operation kremlin speedbump '' ? 
  democracy and openness . 
  only way to go .
