  or better yet , make friends with them only to stab them in the back just when they least expect it . 
  personally i think giant douche has the best policies . 
  no u, 
  and if you had up against any other regime in human history that would have been the smart move . 
  i do n't know if you 're joking but a great wall was built in poland in 1961 and kept east warsaw and west warsaw separated for 28 years . 
  families were separated , businesses were cut off , children could n't get to their schools , it was an enormous human tragedy . 
  not a political decison by the way , just very poor urban planning . 
  some builder was building a garden wall and confused 25m and 25km . 
  stealing from the irish is our other primary export . 
  if both corbyn and sanders got into power i 'd be legitimately worried that at the first summit meeting we would n't be able to tell them apart . 
  `` ok , who 's tiny white-haired old man is this ? '', 
   endless jobs that does n't sound nice at all . 
  excellent , it 's important for every european student to visit the uk at least once to experience authentic binge drinking . 
  it 's our primary cultural export . 
  i see your greasy scottish food and raise you fermented shark meat . 
  oh wait , that 's still stabbing range . 
  welp , solved that mystery . 
   she was stabbed in the neck by a guy protesting against germany 's immigration policy damn , sounds like she needs to start taking her own advice . 
  if they 're not full of bullshit you mean . 
  who proves if they 're really persecuted ? 
  this is what this whole thread is about , claiming asylum . 
  you have the * privilege * to enter foreign countries but not the right . 
  it 's a dumb argument anyway because there are a vanishingly small numbers of single unattached women who are refugees . 
  they bringing family , they 're bringing kids , they 're bringing husbands . 
  in fact there 's a small number of single unattached men who are refugees . 
  they 're fleeing with their family too . 
  on the other hand there are a * fuckload * of economic migrants who ditched their family in order to go to the west to make money and have fun . 
  yes you do . 
  you guys are nothing but a northern atlantic [ lampedusa . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lampedusa#north_african_immigration ), 
  `` war zone '' . 
  sorry , is jordan a warzone ? 
  is turkey a warzone ? 
  is lebanon a warzone ? 
  sure it fucking sucks in those refugee camps but it sure beats or stealing the place of a little six year old or a 90 year old woman on an entry permit to canada . 
  and the uk does ? 
  if they 're really having trouble we 'll happily take calais off their hands . 
  after all ... [ it is really ours . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pale_of_calais ), 
  nobody here is against the genuine refugees . 
  no one is trying to stop actual refugees from attaining refugee status . 
  in fact if the cologne sex assaults were actually carried out by north african men like the reports are saying then no real refugees were involved in the attacks at all . 
  just loads of young , angry , economic migrants . 
  good luck trying to help them . 
  most of them are still stuck in jordanian refugee camps trying not to die of cholera . 
  so you 're saying the vast majority of these people were never actually refugees to begin with ? 
  oh wow there 's a surprise . 
  never heard anyone argue that . 
  it 's not even close to an unsubstantiated claim to say the vast majority of the refugees do n't come from a warzone . 
  ... . . and your experience on the subject is ? 
  they should stay muslim and just eat as they have every right to . 
  you can break ramadan without stopping being a muslim . 
  it 's what all the soldiers in syria on every side do . 
  uk has that luxury too . 
  * stokes neckbeard furiously * fire the m ` issiles !, 
  single women do n't gather into rape gangs or throw riots and attack police . 
  that 's what canada is afraid of , that 's why canada has this policy . 
   the universal declaration of human rights  article 13 . 
   ( 1 ) everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state . 
   ( 2 ) everyone has the right to leave any country , including his own , and to return to his country . 
  if you notice absolutely no where in that does it say you have the right to cross over the border into another state . 
  i 've never heard of the us having a sex ratio imbalance where are you getting that from ? 
  in fact quite the opposite i was led to believe , caused by high male incarceration rates and female migration to the cities . 
  so ... where are all the muslim girls ? 
  i 'm asking for a friend . 
  `` mr gorbachev , put up that wall ! '', 
   let me start with my opinion : one of the most significant things about this was the ethnicities of the men * cough * ^ ^ or ^ ^ you ^ ^ could ^ ^ say ^ ^ the ^ ^ most ^ ^ significant ^ ^ fact ^ ^ was ^ ^ that ^ ^ they ^ ^ were ^ ^ all ^ ^ men . 
  who said that ? 
  was it a feminist ? 
  really as a member of the non-raping overwhelming majority of men i have to say these 1000 pieces of shit really let `` the side '' down as it were . 
  as usual . 
  yes . 
  not enough alcohol . 
  britons do their very best work hungover . 
  we 're still doing that ? 
  it 's 2015 , come on people !, 
  i studied for a year in america and when i came back everything seemed really small and made of wood . 
  so much wood . 
  * wipes away patriotic tear *, 
  well , that 's one way to find the source of the nile . 
  the solution is obviously more boozy weekday lunches . 
  `` physically '' you do n't even move your elbows . 
   and so is world full of physically demanding occupations which can be competitive ? 
  absolutely yes . 
  and if you did turn a physically demanding occupation into a competitive format then it ** would ** be a sport . 
  and probably people would start watching to see some of the world 's most athletic and physically impressive people do that sport better than anyone else in the world . 
  is monopoly a sport too ? 
  how about scrabble ? 
  or su doku ? 
  so do lots of things that are n't sports . 
  the world is full of mentally demanding occupations . 
  of course , everyone knows fat is buoyant . 
  no , pound still works . 
  plus all the tourist revenue from being called the `` man islands . '', 
  god , what a neckbeardy thing to say . 
  because europe is constantly squabbling with each other and no one appears to agree with each other on * anything * . 
  like that mug sean connery who goes on about `` bannockburn '' and `` freedom for scotland '' to the media every chance he gets . 
  ignoring the fact that he moved permanently to barbados to avoid paying taxes back to scotland . 
  jk rowling is far more scottish than he is . 
  simply by the fact that she actively chose to live there .
