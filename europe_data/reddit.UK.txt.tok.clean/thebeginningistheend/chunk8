  maybe you just went to a crap school . 
  [ clearly did n't understand . 
  i was talking about this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/it%27s_the_economy,_stupid ), 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  ask bill clinton . 
  should have invested in a g20 then and not in a country the size of a small city . 
  yeah , americans/australians ... those guys ... . definitely . 
  [ like this guy ? 
  ... and anyone who recognises chess as a sport must also recognise checkers , backgammon , tic-tac-toe , tiddlywinks , jenga and candyland as sports as well , or else you 're just being inconsistent . 
  [ how dare you not recognise these fine men as athletes , sir . 
  how dare you , they 're in prime physical condition !, 
  handball ? 
  oh you mean land water-polo . 
  * do n't say genocide do n't say genocide do n't say genocide . 
  * dammit !, 
  both those sports are n't that popular in most of europe though . 
  that 's like saying there 's no such thing as the world 's second tallest person . 
  ice hockey or field hockey ? 
  `` welcome to britain , you 'll never leave ! '', 
  did you know factories are n't even allowed to send in small children to unclog the large machinery anymore ? 
  shocking !, 
  how about you go to war with russia and the rest of the free world will see how you do . 
  australia was being supported by uranus ? 
  that makes sense . 
  if you call that bloody participating !, 
  [ germany leads to lay off the weed . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol - ), 
  that 's exactly what happened . 
  by essentially glorifying it . 
  truffaut was right . 
  guilty . 
  you got ta admit it , things worked much better when we owned it . 
  everyone 's so keen to kick out the british . 
  but no clue how to get along once we 're no longer around to take all the blame . 
  edit : haters \u2193, 
  you do n't win a quarter of the globe by believing * no * means * no * . 
  we would n't have had to invade if you guys had just invited us . 
  if i recall he helped found hogwarts and built the chamber of secrets . 
  at least not without a helping hand . 
  depends if we 're in italy or not . 
  do n't worry , they 'll never get that past the daily mail anyway . 
  that poor jesus . 
   apart from the issue of cheating on his first wife . 
  he cheated on diana . 
  tiny fucking houses that people are pathetically grateful just to afford . 
  this is dumb . 
  why not just join nato ? 
  returning ? 
  so we already made a mistake the first time and now we 're expected to repeat it ? 
  ffs . 
  that looks like it would be an absolute bitch to administrate . 
  internal politics has an unfortunate tendency to spill out into external politics . 
  i say we compromise and turn it into disney world byzantium . 
  with orthodox christian , islamic , ottoman and crusade themed rollercoaster rides . 
  also nearby a gallipoli-themed water park . 
  we 're not great britain , we 're the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland . 
  i think you mean 93 and and 64 years respectively . 
  sorry to break it to you but the uk will break up long before the eu ever does . 
  like absolutely every political decision made out of bad faith and spite rather than logic and clear sense it 'll inevitably end up blowing up in your own face . 
   i 'm having a hard time to understand the british behavior because at this rate they are just going to infuriate what used to be their closest ( on geography ) allies and their most important business partners . 
  because this time you 're not dealing with the british people , you 're dealing with the hard-right wing of the hard-right conservative party . 
  a thick-as-pigshit group of antiquated mps suddenly empowered by the critical mass of stupidity that was the referendum vote . 
  if they were n't so thick they would n't be there in the first place . 
  a brexitexit , if you will . 
  / r/hailcorporate, 
  oh jeez someone break out the accordion . 
   liftwaffle [ ... ] ( http://images1.dallasobserver.com/imager/u/745xauto/7030165/luftwaffle_danzettwoch.jpg ), 
  purely defensive ? 
  what if iran invades kuwait ? 
  what if north korea nukes seoul ? 
  what if there 's another rwandan mass genocide ? 
  what if cyprus has a civil war ? 
  how can you be 100 % defensive without abdicating some form of responsibility for global stability ? 
  still beats the cold war . 
  [ if you google the date you find this interesting turkish movie on the subject .

  it 's fascinating how close the roots of the ottoman empire are to the old city of constantinople . 
  it was always an empire built around that key strategic point of the turkish straits . 
  what could be more european than a religion invented by a native levantine derived from an older religion invented by a mesopotamian and refined by refugees from egypt ? 
  a lexiteer is the epitome of the term : `` useful idiot '', 
  i think you broke him . 
  his biggest mistake was the # 3 labour vote . 
   i hope very much that the people elected to power in your country do n't share your view . 
  i see you 're not that familiar with the conservative party . 
  of course . 
  japan 's economy is as large as it is brittle . 
  they do n't like nasty surprises . 
  basically sums it up really . 
  itt : `` we have to be weak because being strong is too hard , you idiot !! 1 ! 1 !! '', 
  my only obligations are those that are defined in law . 
  democracy is nothing but a system we act within and are constrained by . 
  there 's no greater meaning to it than that . 
  who says ? 
  the uk does n't have civil wars , we have politics . 
  and both are alike in that it takes more than one side to declare a truce . 
  succeeding in getting a free trade deal with australia is like boasting because you convinced your grandma to show up to your birthday party . 
   if you did n't want to decide things like this in a referendum then you should n't have had a referendum on it , consider it lesson learned . 
  sorry , do you think i 'm david cameron or something ?
