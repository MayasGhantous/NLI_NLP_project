why does barack obama insist on going against the us congress ? 
  what the euroskeptics are saying is its under the influence of the eu and for a greater european project rather than for the portugese , and that that is a point of concern . 
  similar to how bernie sanders is now tearing down against the corporate . 
  thank you to all but especially / u/uyth for having this discussion as many of the points you brought up explaining what you have observed in portugal i can not be familiar with myself , and will take that into consideration . 
  *** i ca n't respond to anyone now because i keep getting downvoted . 
  * sigh * i 'll just read and chat about it to some other people . 
  i am trying to explain to you the euroskeptic position . 
  what you said about barack obama is n't relvant at all . 
  instead it would be like barack obama having the opportunity to choose whether the house was republican regardless of the people 's choice . 
  yes the house governs together but you are selecting one side as the leader . 
   president by the way is the only election in portugal which is direct , personal , electing the person and just that person and requiring 50 % +1 of the votes . 
  this is true . 
  your president is democratic , so was this other election , are you saying the people are sometime 's more right ? 
  if this ballot is democratic . 
  if it is true to democracy then the portugese have casted more votes for the left bloc and the president shoud have respected that . 
  that is the euroskeptic view . 
  some argue that this is part of a more major crisis of the eu meddling in a nation 's democracy , and point to what happens in italy ad greece , and even fer a political elite . 
   and no , there is no majority parliamentary democratic group yet , not yet , because they have committed to nothing and presented . 
  that 's like looking at the situation through a rolled up newspaper , obviously there will be . 
  i am trying to say i do not see the counterpoint so please explain . 
  i speak to some in portugal who are not at all okay with the president 's decision , but i suppose it would matter less if your political party stands to benefit . 
  again the issue being brought about of antidemocracy is the tendency towards the eu at the cost of the choice of the electorate . 
   so what are you thinking the eu would do with him after a brexit ? 
  employ him for charity ? 
  he lost in his constituency so of course he would be out of a job . 
  so effectively what you 're saying is : - nigel farage became an eu parlaiment member to reign in the big bucks - nigel farage saw that the british people had n't had a referendum on the eu in 40 years and saw his chance to secure a big shot position if they exit the eu - he creates a party , runs for pm and speaks out in the eu parliament and yells at them about leaving while raking in cash , because he knows when he leaves he wo n't need dirty yuropean money , the british people will think him a hero and literally throw money at him ( though he has no position in parliament and his party will literally dissolve into irrelevancy if it does pass ) - sometimes the eu said something farage did n't agree with , so he called them out on it on several interviews and in person , getting fined a couple times , all in the name of money !, 
  - rather than stay in the eu parliament with what he has publicly stated as a much larger salary than needed , he decides to call out the president - ensures british referendum to exit , so that he no longer is the head of his party in the eu , his party in britain , and loses relevancy in british news . 
  it was a 20-year plan but it was worth it !, 
  the left bloc is euroskeptic and they got a majority , that is the issue here , and that 's before twisting . 
  i did n't call it undemocratic i called the president 's antidemocratic , as that is what it is . 
  how can a governing body be * selected * to represent the people and ** not ** represent a majority . 
   everyone who advocates an eu that is only a loose trade agreement seems to do their best to ignore that i mean you use the term loose , but other than that an organisation of trade and economic coopertion is what it was advertised as , at least in the uk , and what was voted on . 
  the eu evolved to be far different . 
  again , this may sound fine to you as i 'm sure it does to majority of the belgians , but the majority of british seem hold a different view to what this partnershp should be . 
  here is part of the reason why farage wants the eu to break up : [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ucyjnrcgu )  it 's to destroy it , because they dread european cohesion if they ca n't dominate it . 
  woah , where did you pull this one from ? 
  i would prefer if you explained so that i do n't go around spreading more of my brainwashed political views . 
  yes he 's getting paid by the eu , that 's why he wants the brits to leave : so he can lose his job . 
  ok everything maks sense now . 
  let me explain my logic on democracy , and maybe you can see where my euroskepticism originates : if i am to call something democratic , then it should be representative of a majority by a free and fair election . 
  if the primary governing body is to be called democratic , then it should be the majority democratic group within the government hich is representative of the people . 
  euroskeptics hold the view that the pro-eu decision by the president is antidemocratic , since it is against the choice of the people . 
  some euroskeptics say it is due to the behaviour of a political elite who stand to benefit , others say it was caused by pressure from the eu , either way this is what is causing the outrage , and not whether or not it was legal . 
   portuguese holding a radically different opinion ? 
  on what , the constitution ? 
  on the fact that this has more to do with pro-eu motives . 
  i suppose yes ? 
  i disagree with him being a xenophobe , i sleep with a picture of mussolini . 
  that is all . 
  i 'm not calling it illegal , all that is being said is : ( quoted from above comment )  the issue being brought about by nigel farage here pertaining to euroskepticism is that rather that the fact that their seems to be this extremely strong push for pro-eu at the expense of the electorate is a good reason to be euroskeptic . 
  you 're being pedantic , we both know it is the president 's choice ; the issue being brought about by nigel farage here pertaining to euroskepticism is that rather that the fact that their seems to be this extremely strong push for pro-eu at the expense of the electorate is a good reason to be euroskeptic . 
   i 'm sorry , but his stance is not saying anything about an alternative . 
  in that video he did not explicitly state an alterntive , no , however he has stated that he would be ok with an eu not of political union , but one of `` trade and economic cooperation '' . 
  do you need a source or have you heard the line before ? 
  what he 's saying is that the choice of the president was surely influenced by his pro-eu tendencies rather than anything a democratic nation would go by . 
  i did n't say coup , farage did n't say coup , but i have talked to portugese who seem to hold a radically different view to you . 
  actually he preceded the french xenophobes by quite a bit . 
  again , as an immigrant minority i disagree with him being a xenophobe , however if you can link me to a video where he is one i will better understand your opinion . 
  ok there is a ton of anti-nigel farage bias in that comment and so let me address your concerns :  he is not productive in any committee he sits in . 
  i guess but that 's not what he was voted in for by the british people imo . 
  ( also several europoliticians do n't actually participate in their respective committees )  yet he cashes in the cheques . 
  yeah , including calling out eu parliament members on several occasions and being fined for it . 
  [ remember this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dranqfntngo )  complaining about money wasted by brussels in some of those speeches is hilarious . 
  the fact that their spending was n't transparent for a period of time did n't concern you ? 
   if he were sincere in stopping the uk from being a part of the european union he would be more active in the uk . 
  he spends the least time in brussels of any europarliament party leader , furthermore if he is voted in to represent as part of the parliament clearly he should not ` waste taxpayers money ' by avoiding it completely , after all that is the true reason he is voted in  sorry mate , but he the use of ` european empire ' is fucking ludicrous ?????? 
  that 's the term used by the president of the comission [ video here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ralocq9ue )  also i hope the uk stays and this clown finds the last bit of decency in his closet and stops wasting not just yours but my money as well again he is n't wasting your money , its the british who pay for him . 
  he 's doing exactly what we voted him in for , as our euroskeptic polls clearly show . 
  that is insanity , one coalition represents a larger portion of the electorate . 
  in a democratic society they are clearly the true winners . 
   xenophobic politicians like nigel farage well while i do not totally agree with you ( from an objective point of view of a minority immigrant ) about him being a xenophobe , at least you took the time to realise the outrage that is portugal 's political situation . 
  ( honestly he is n't you should look up a few videos about him on youtube . 
  i do n't really want to diverge too much into farage 's politics anymore though ), 
   this is what 's wrong with nigel farage , he wishes to forsake the eu but gives nothing but things that clearly have n't worked as an alternative . 
  actually that is n't quite true : [ here is his true position ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lleffiygcro ) not that i want to get into ukip politics , but he has said countless times , what he wishes for from the eu is for trade and basic regulations , and not more of a superstate ( exactly as you have put it right there ) . 
  angela merkel ** said ** the eu 's position on alot of things the british object to ( like free movement ) is non-negotiable , now where does that leave us ? 
  agreed , though it is alot better than in the past , at least we have the opportunity to ask for a nation state through a referendum . 
  i also think britain should move towards becoming a federalised state . 
  let me explain ; i have n't run into a single belgian person who even considers euroskepticism and are especially adamant about the sucess of the project . 
  my best guess is the sucess of the eu is directly tied to the importance of belgium . 
  simply look at your own comment , you completely avoid addressing the fact that what 's happening in portugal is an outrage , then go on to say that a democratically elected member of the parliament should stop wasting taxpayers money by bringing up a perfectly valid point.which is strange seeing as he is essentially the * only * opposition leader in the entirety of the european parliament to the idea of the european empire . 
  also when you look at the polls for brexit it does n't at all look like he is wasting british taxpayer 's money , seeing as more of them agree with him at this moment . 
  you do n't seem to understand what happened . 
  its a coalition government , read more here : http://www.euractiv.com/sections/elections/political-crisis-boiling-portugal-318846, 
  if you were from any country other than belgium i suppose i would take this comment alot more seriously . 
  edit : and i do n't mean to be rude, 
  transcript : as this migrant crisis begins to overwhelm the european union , and yes it is an existential crisis , perhaps we should ask ourselves what really is the true nature of this project ? 
  because i 've heard a lot today about rights , well what about democratic rights ? 
  because i think what we are seeing is an increasingly authoritarian european union that crushes democratic rights and then actually crows about it . 
  every single time there is a crisis , it is national democracy that loses . 
  we saw back in 2011 the italian prime minister berlusconi sounding eurosceptic , removed and replaced by a puppet prime minister . 
  we saw exactly the same happen in greece in 2011 , mr papandreou threatened a referendum on euro membership , there was a coup against him , he was replaced by a puppet . 
  in this migrant crisis we 've seen four countries , led by the strongest hungary , making it clear they want no part of eu migrant quotas , only to find themselves crushed through eu trickery and made to accept the very thing they said no to . 
  and i never forget seeing the greek prime minister mr tspiras sitting just over there having won a general election and then come to this house to be told that the manifesto was unacceptable and it must be ditched . 
  well i think all of this has reached a new low this week with portugal . 
  virtually unremarked upon by the media and yet for those who do n't know there is now , following a general election , a left wing majority with a socialist plan for portugal , and yet the president of portugal , mr silva , is refusing them office on the grounds that they represent anti-european forces and is allowing the minority conservative pro-eu prime minister to stay in place . 
  this is the modern day implementation of the brezhnev doctrine . 
  this is exactly what happened to states living inside the ussr . 
  what is been made clear here with greece and indeed with portugal is that a country only has democratic rights if it 's in favour of the project .
