` bad ' in a manner of speaking . 
  overpopulation is a major problem globally . 
  i 'm glad it 's not real , the orange and green clash horribly . 
  it 's a shame people are n't taught what political ideologies entail . 
  only someone totally clueless could think the ddr was communist . 
  edit : communism is stateless . 
  the ddr was totalitarian . 
  the two are mutually exclusive . 
  depends on the animal surely . 
   elect her to be the queen of scotland bit beside the point of a hereditary monarchy surely . 
  personally i 'm disappointed that scotland is n't going republican . 
  i suppose the yes campaign does n't want to scare anyone off with too much radicalism . 
  i 'd be a bit disappointed if cassetteboy is doing work for sky news now . 
  i 'm not welsh , i just live here . 
  i actually am german . 
  a bit like ` we tortured some folks ' then ? 
  he makes it sounds so banal . 
  good . 
  let 's build a wall . 
  fuck russia , everything it does and everything it stands for . 
  it 's a good question i 'm not really educated enough on the topic to answer . 
  as i understand it , \u00fe is used to pronounce the softer ` th ' as in , ` father ' and \u00f0 is the shorter , harder ` voiced ' ` th ' as in ` the ' . 
  i ca n't speak with any authority though ; i do n't study linguistics , i just sometimes wish i do . 
  do n't be thrown off by the eth ( the letter which looks like a d with a stroke through it ) icelandic is one of the only languages which still uses it , but lots of others used to , including english . 
  it just means the ` th ' sound in ` them ' . 
  it 's like the ` dd ' digraph in welsh , which means the same thing . 
  as mentioned in another thread on this topic , this does n't mean much because of the gini coefficient difference between the two countries . 
  that is , the averages are skewed because of the gigantic wealth of a small number of people . 
  there are major cost of living differences between the uk and us too , healthcare most notably . 
  the statistics in the article might be technically correct , but they 're not very insightful . 
  the spectator is a right-wing , free market capitalist publication which is usually very simpering towards the us anyway . 
  you should try nepalese seafood , and the stuff they catch off the coast of chad is delicious too . 
  if someone does n't sell t-shirts which have ` irish national stud ' printed on them , they 're missing out on an opportunity to make a lot of money from douchebags . 
  those do n't really work . 
  see : ` greek-style salad cheese ', 
  i 'm so sick of fucking putin and russia . 
  it 's like a country run by some pathetic fps multiplayer infant troll . 
  yes , i understand that thanks . 
  because the ussr and its associated states were what ` second world ' meant . 
  the name was essentially created to describe russia . 
  moreover , third world meant unaffiliated/neutral states . 
  russia is of course anything but neutral . 
   you are turning into 3rd world kinda ironically . 
  really ? 
  it does n't look deco to me . 
  it is ( like most icons of stalinist architecture ) heavily drawn from neoclassicism , and deco was in no small part specifically a reaction against neoclassical/beaux arts architecture . 
  not really , no . 
  it 's american imperialism like invading our subreddits which is the source of internationally broadly-held contempt of the us !, 
  this is a european subreddit !, 
  talk about american trains elsewhere , like on the 90 % of subs with overwhelmingly us content !, 
  it also looks incredibly swish . 
  i was going to say the same thing . 
  i 'd recognise algorithmically generated difference clouds anywhere . 
  i really like the lyrics . 
  it has to be one of the most optimistic and egalitarian anthems i 've ever heard . 
  the anthem of russia is the same melody , though the lyrics have been altered . 
  presumably to erase references to the will of the people , freedom , etc. 
  i have a soft spot for [ the internationale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8emx7y16vo ) not a fan of the red flag though . 
  god save the queen is indeed awful , particularly given that barely anyone here believes in god . 
  personally i do n't support the monarchy either , so i would never sing it . 
  it also makes me think of funerals . 
  [ jerusalem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkaj4b0xymi ) is a beautiful hymn , but again in this day and age i think the religious content make it irrelevant . 
  [ see also this rave classic ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwtsdjapcsi ) [ hen wlad fy nhadau ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welsh_national_anthem ) is pretty nice and lacks religious content , but i do n't think many people know the words given that even in wales not that many people speak welsh . 
  i do n't know if the sentiment really resonates with people . 
  and i suppose it 's a bit slow-paced . 
  i 'm not welsh , i just live here , so take this with a pinch of salt . 
  i really like le marseillaise . 
  i know , i 'm a traitor . 
  [ this gets me every time ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm-e2h1chjm ) . 
  though it 's not european , i also have a soft spot for [ a bit of sousa . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mrn9chmray ) like being at the circus . 
  unhateably cheesy . 
  [ ca n't there be just * one * part of reddit ? 
  ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/42988144.jpg ), 
  i 've always found that pretty disturbing as a fetish . 
  ca n't be pleasant for the baby . 
  which people are these ? 
  i 'm not a person apparently . 
  i did n't think the five star people bought into this sort of nonsense really . 
  maybe i should pay more attention to italian politics ... 
  it looks as though europe * has * turned heavily right . 
  i know some young people whose first language is welsh . 
  it still happens !, 
  most of the songs are mediocre , always . 
  the remainders are batshit insane . 
  those are the ones i watch for . 
  what , one evening a year , as an excuse for a piss-up ? 
  you must take your time extremely seriously , only you 're wasting precious seconds wasting your time commenting on a reddit post about something you profess active disinterest in . 
  [ that 's what they want you to think !, 
  ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ffeszslyzyc/tgjau0rszxi/aaaaaaaabxs/wwaw0n7m0hq/s1600/adolfsalmond.jpg ), 
  they should 've stuck with the trifle . 
  trifle is delicious . 
  no , but it certainly gives them an advantage amongst companies of their type . 
  tesla 's advantage is that they have elon musk 's billions to work with . 
  or that any internal combustion car carries around a large quantity of extremely inflammable liquid at any time , and car accidents quite often involve fire . 
  so whenever religious people commit atrocities it 's the fault of a ` sensationalist media ' ? 
  how convenient for your narrative . 
  anyone who says ` people 's personal religions do n't do any harm ' should read a newspaper . 
  people do n't ` keep personal ' the religious prerogative to evangelize , and castigate outsiders , and interfere with supposed ` sins ' . 
  in the uk 36 anglican priests , the lords spiritual , * vote on our legislation .
