  i have grand plans . 
  i 'll have to do something to keep myself sane for three years at any rate . 
  any suggestions ? 
  well , small world indeed !, 
  i will be a first year , yeah , but i 'm a few years late going to uni , and have lived independently for a couple of years already , so i hopefully will be able to find my feet okay . 
  pretty scary though , leeds is pretty much all i 've ever known . 
  i 'm not op but i 'd consider having  england flags plastered across the front of their house an overt nationalist display . 
  and i know many people who would feel very uncomfortable with such a display , with the england flag particularly . 
  i dunno , there 's a strong working class and unionist tradition in wales . 
  i think that wales , scotland and the north of england have more in common with each-other socially , culturally and economically than with the south of england . 
  hey , i 'm a yorkshireman who is about to move to aberystwyth !, 
  is welsh nationalism really a problem ? 
  i mean , do really take it seriously to the point where it starts to become ` racist ' ( by which i mean discriminative against people from another country , not actually of different racial makeup ) ? 
  gib is like if the bnp took over ibiza . 
  i like [ this flag ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/e/es-catco.gif ), 
  obviously syria is n't a member of nato , i 'm not a * complete * moron . 
  but i think it 's likely that sooner or later an embassy will get conveniently bombed or someone will get abducted or * something * will happen to a country with whom we are in a treaty that they can call ` an attack ' . 
  if britain does not send troops to syria for the duration of this conflict i will buy a hat to eat . 
  there is a complicated enough web of treaties that at some point someone will claim that something-or-other constitutes an attack and we will be compelled to respond militarily . 
  nato compels countries to engage in defending an attacked member . 
  there are a myriad of other treaties with similar stipulations . 
  in as much as being a signatory is the wilful decision of a sovereign nation , they can still be drawn into conflicts with no particular national benefit . 
  they will keep on having votes until they get the result they want . 
  that is if we are n't brought into the conflict some other way first . 
  give it a few weeks . 
  i know , but i did n't say anything to imply that so i thought i 'd be pedantic about it . 
  i reckon a member of nato will conveniently find itself under something it considers a form of attack . 
  it 's hard to rewrite the history of events that have n't come to pass yet . 
  yep . 
  the vote in the commons will prove to be utterly meaningless when the uk is inevitably dragged into the conflict anyway . 
  it will probably be something to do with nato again . 
  ah , fair enough . 
  i suppose that 's nicer for him . 
  i knew it looked wrong !, 
  technical team final report : after careful investigation it is the finding of this team that the on-board microwave had accidentally been set to 800w rather than the 600w mandated for the macaroni cheese ready meal food provision . 
  poor monsieur guillotin . 
  executed with his own invention . 
  of course . 
  idiot mistake , i forgot russia is n't in the eu, 
  if it was based on population , smaller countries would find it extremely difficult to protect their interests . 
  we 'd just be being pushed around by russia . 
  i was only joking !, 
  definitely . 
  the downvotes i 'm getting on that post amuse me profoundly . 
  surely people are n't taking it seriously ? 
  i do n't really have anything to say in response , but i did want to point out that i like your username . 
  it 's a brilliant film that hits rather close to home with the way the country is going . 
  i suspect that demonyms have a lot to do with it . 
  that is , ` britain ' makes more sense because the demonym for people from the uk is british . 
  i think that english people are often reluctant to call themselves english , particularly because of the far-right connotations ( edl , etc ) . 
  i am english * technically * but i would always introduce myself as british rather than english . 
  that said , i 'll be moving to wales soon hopefully !, 
  maybe i can become an honorary welshman . 
   our politicians do n't campaign on putting the united back into the kingdom ( though i have this horrible suspicion they will now ) . 
  if scotland becomes independent , ( i secretly hope it does , but know it wo n't ) , northern england and wales should go with it and form a new union . 
  fuck westminster , we have far more in common with each-other than we do with the south . 
  it might only cost a few hundred pounds to get a basic system installed , but seriously , it would n't get used the vast majority of the time . 
  i ca n't speak for everyone but i use the radiators in my house all the time . 
  almost definitely .

  the world war i memorial industry is apparently how we recovered from the great depression . 
  keynesian economics in action . 
  that was truly hilarious . 
  i laughed my yorkshireman arse off , between bouts of retching . 
  i really do n't understand why people find the whole thing so confusing . 
  i mean , everyone has managed to get to grips with what to call holland . 
  i might take to calling the american revolutionary war ` france 's revenge ' . 
  it 's not a case of tap designs , it 's to do with modern hot water systems . 
  houses used to ( and older/un-renovated ones often still do ) have hot water tanks in an upstairs cupboard or attic which heat water for a couple of hours a day and then keep it warm like a flask . 
  these tanks , according to folk legend , were often discovered to contain dead , boiled frogs and pigeons and other such horrors . 
  these stories are dubious because the tanks are usually sealed apart from the water inlet and outlet pipes , leaving no aperture large enough for animal incursions . 
  modern and renovated houses have boilers which heat water as and when it is required , directly from the cold water mains . 
  not only does that mean it is potable , it also means you never ` run out of hot water ' , a major inconvenience in houses with hot water tank systems , and the cause of perpetual terror for most people over the age of 60 . 
  only the very wealthy have it , because for the vast majority of british houses , for the vast majority of the year , it 's completely unnecessary . 
  also it 'd be too expensive for our exorbitant electricity costs to cope with . 
  you must be a blast at anthropogenic global warming denial meetings . 
  well , budapest does n't have an r in it . 
  so i wo n't get confused,
