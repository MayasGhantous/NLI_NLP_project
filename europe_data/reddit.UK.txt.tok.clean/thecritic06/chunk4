  bucha ** r ** est for ** r ** omania . 
  that 's how i 'll remember it . 
  spectacular derp on my behalf . 
  it 's really right-wing . 
  i would like to see ~ ~ bucharest ~ ~ * budapest * at some point , but i dared n't go . 
  low denomination banknotes are a terrible idea and there 's a reason they are globally going the way of the dodo . 
  let 's not have any more , not even so that you can grope women . 
  they have , and they dismissed it for security reasons , because it would require cashiers to know what the euro banknotes for every european country looked like so they did n't accept fakes and refuse genuine ones . 
  when i saw the proposed churchill # 5 banknote i was horrified by how badly it looked but assumed it was a preliminary design . 
  but if this austen banknote is in precisely the same , hideous style , i 'm beginning to worry . 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  i think the millions upon millions of deaths would have made rather a difference had they not happened . 
  not to mention the billions of dollars of debt incurred by various european countries , and the foundation of the council of europe ( which precipitated the eu ), 
  there 's a partouze in mon pantalons and you 're all , appropriately , invited . 
  it does n't always translate well to the written word . 
  only to morons with a contempt for the definitions of words . 
  you clearly do n't understand what fascism means . 
  fascist ? 
  i 'm not sure you could be much more wrong . 
  it 'd probably have resulted in a resignation amongst scandal in the uk or us . 
  the anthony wiener scandal comes to mind . 
  this time next week : the cash for eeeuughhhhhhhs scandal . 
  the people are n't horrible ? 
  i could n't have told you that from looking at parliament !, 
  nope . 
  legoland windsor attracts more visitors than windsor castle . 
  the most popular tourist destination in the world , the louvre , is an ex-monarchical palace . 
  it and versaille both see more visitors than buckingham palace . 
  if i recall correctly , the king of italy abdicated after a referendum , leaving the country a republic . 
  a decorator who accepts cash still might declare their income . 
  it 's not inherently illegal because they were paid in cash . 
  this rescue from a dystopian future hellscape is part-financed by the european development fund . 
  i 'm not proud of the uk 's policy on this issue , it 's just that the tone of your previous post implied that asylum is not already offered to people on the basis of sexuality , which is false . 
  you also claimed that `` everyone would be claiming asylum by non-hetero orientation '' which is also false , because not all asylum seekers to the uk apply on those grounds . 
  i do n't really know what you mean . 
  i 've been injured on demonstrations before . 
  well , it 's a quote from a wikipedia article . 
  i just love the idea of a ` socialist ' state-owned gay bar . 
  i like to think there were giant rainbow hammer-and-compasses . 
  to maintain stability , you need a population refresh rate of one child on average for each adult . 
  i 'm not saying some children would n't be born and/or adopted , but i fear the sheer volume of births required would be an issue in a society where most people are not predisposed towards conceiving . 
  i 'm lgbt myself , by the way . 
   towards the end of the 1980s however , just before the collapse of the iron curtain , the east german government opened a state-owned gay disco in berlin . 
  those ten years were pretty interesting apparently . 
  i fear a nation of lgbt people might have difficulty maintaining a healthy population . 
  in the uk , we already accept people for asylum on the grounds of sexuality , and we 're hardly inundated with gay ugandans . 
  no-one ever seems to answer the ` what about infertile heterosexuals ' question . 
  and that 's a shame , because the level of cognitive dissonance required to maintain the viewpoint would be a sight to behold . 
  what 's wrong with people hating your opinions ? 
  opinions are n't precious cut crystal trinkets that must be kept only in a gallery environment where they are protected and respected . 
  opinions are like home-made submarines . 
  they are by virtue of their purpose constantly under pressure from every quarter , and if you ca n't see where the leaks are and patch them up , they are doomed . 
  everyone 's opinions ought to be under constant scrutiny . 
  it does n't mean people dislike you as a person for disagreeing with them . 
  it 's about rigour , integrity and factuality . 
  most people on reddit , at this stage , recognise that opposition to lgbt rights is a submarine which will never resist the water pressure of scrutiny , no matter what ideas and tenets and opinions are used to patch the many , many holes . 
  who are you to insist on one very narrow definition of this ` institution ' when it has had [ so many definitions before ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_fj9nut_l9k/t2cvh59u2ai/aaaaaaaabxc/rfuq7qakxuk/s1600/biblical_marriage_chart.jpg ) ? 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  i think meaningful debate about every topic under the sun happens on reddit happens every day . 
  sure , the unpopular side might get downvoted , but what difference does it make ? 
  the conversations are still being had . 
  or is a pacifist along the lines of ghandi 's philosophy of protest . 
  a lot of them certainly seem to be . 
  few countries in the world are going actively backwards in civil rights terms , but russia is managing to do it . 
  what exactly was rosa parks expecting when she refused to move ? 
  what exactly was emily davison expecting when she ran towards a racehorse running at full tilt ? 
  what exactly was maximilian kolbe expecting when he volunteered to be executed in someone else 's place ? 
  it is n't about defending oneself from harm , it 's about making a point . 
  i 'm not saying this protester will be glad to have been photographed being assaulted , but you ca n't advance a civil rights struggle without self-sacrifice . 
  hitler lost , mr ' 88 ' . 
  well bonjour there . 
  damnit , caught red handed . 
  i went to rabble-rouse at an extremist demo and was dismayed , nay , * aghast * at the extremism i saw !, 
  seriously . 
  anyone who talks to anjem choudary for a ` muslim opinion ' loses all credibility instantaneously . 
  this crap is n't remotely representative of the national picture . 
  * hard to find - somewhere near the icy pole . 
  * cold people . 
  * hot elks ( a horny horde in every fjord ) . 
  * swedish chef * death playing chess - somewhat obsure reference to film unfortunately only ~ 0.1 % of non-swedes have seen . 
  * girl with the dragon tattoo * green to our planet - recycling is in their hearts . 
  * ikea ( went worldwide , difficult to assemble ) * h&m * some quite famous artists/scientists * gay marriage ---------------------- swedes : * strict and structured * seldom vent * do n't show emotion , never whine * difficult to please * like queueing * proper , polite and private * do n't talk on trains . 
  * suspicious of friendly strangers * supernaturally strong red-headed infants * descended from vikings * men do n't have titties , can raise kids * girls have balls ( ? 
  ---------------------------- diet : * horse meatballs * lingonberries ( available in ikea outlets europe-wide ) * dairy digestion issues - ( widespread lactose intolerance ? ), 
  * gravad lax and dill * aquavit * crayfish * salty licorice -------------------------- music : * carola * waterloo * diggi-loo ( no-one remembers ) * euphoria ( last year ) * ace of base ------------------------- * must n't take themselves too seriously . 
  okay , i 'll admit it , my sweden knowledge is patchy at best and ~ ~ mostly ~ ~ entirely derived from one source . 
  ` free speech ' is a magical , fictional ideal in a fantasy world where words do n't have ramifications . 
  that is to say , not this world . 
  the crime ` incitement to commit a criminal act ' is surely prosecuting ` free speech ' , but everyone understands that saying certain things is irresponsible and worthless if not damaging . 
  hate speech is very similar to incitement to commit criminal acts , just a more dilute form . 
  we ca n't pretend that hate speech does n't have real-world consequences to people 's lives . 
  you ca n't argue that a gay married couple would * inevitably * raise ` fucked up kids ' without being homophobic because the ` gay ' part is literally ** the only difference ** to everyone else . 
  paycheck late ? 
  burn a car !, 
  burn a car !, 
  cat pissed on your carpet ? 
  burn a car !, 
  it 's the french way . 
  yeah . 
  i do n't speak german but i recognized a few words and phrases that clearly had n't been included in the subtitles .
