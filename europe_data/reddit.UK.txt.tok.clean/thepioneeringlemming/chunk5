  it was n't really the naval issue which was the main problem , the issue was the combination of the german army and navy . 
  britain 's days were also limited in that continental empires were fast catching up with seaborne ones , and were in the process of/and now have overtaken them entirely . 
  it was only a matter of time , which never happened in germant 's case due to two world wars , instead it was the americans . 
  how would an eu army be any different to nato ? 
  there are already eu battlegroups . 
  it just seems like pointless double hatting and also too insular . 
  like great eu army , but will poland care about some island dispute somewhere which threatens the trade of only one other eu nation ? 
  would eu nations be willing to wage war in order to defend another eu nation ? 
  like with the rise of extreme politics what if one eu nation did something idiotic and got itself into a war , would anyone want to support them ? 
  nato is enough of a tie down as it is . 
  since the end of the cold war , and even including recent events the threat level to eu has massively decreased . 
  russia although scary is n't stupid enough to go to war and would n't win any war because of the huge force disparity between it and nato . 
  the communist bloc no longer exists . 
  so it seems like a pretty pointless endeavour . 
  there 'd be massive arguments between all the nations , france will want everyone to have french tanks , germany will want german tanks ect . 
  france will want the official language to be french , germany will want it german . 
  no one would want american kit , because they want to support their own industries . 
  at its heart the eu is incredibly protectionist , it would n't work too well , you can barely get french people to buy german cars , let alone their government start buying german military vehicles at the expense of their own industry ect . 
  the us could probably half its surface fleet and still be able to retain it , and nato 's wider position within the world with forces to spare . 
  i would n't say exagerrated , the issue was that germany had a much more powerful army than britain ( and france , and even britain and france together it was still a close run thing at times ) , but if the growth of the german navy had been allowed to continue to a point where it could match , or at least realistically contest rn supremacy britain 's position would be compromised . 
  but as a international body different flags would help a lot considering things like the name of an institution ca n't really be changed , some confusion is unavoidable . 
  but the same flag seems to cement any sort of confusion `` its all europe '' . 
  luxembourg and the netherlands flag are similar but not identical , even if you did n't know which one was which if you put them next to each other you can see they are different . 
  not a specific link just all the brexit propaganda . 
  ask an average joe on the street `` what is the difference between the council of europe , the european union and the european council '' and they willl have no idea what you are talking about . 
  it almost pythonesque `` peoples front of judea '' `` popular peoples front of judea '' `` peoples popular front of jueda '' , a logo and name change would be no bad thing . 
  the stars do n't even mean anything , they are just there . 
   `` it features a circle of 12 gold stars on a blue background . 
  they stand for the ideals of unity , solidarity and harmony among the peoples of europe . 
  the number of stars has nothing to do with the number of member countries , though the circle is a symbol of unity . '', 
  ( https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/symbols/flag_en ) also how does this mean anything , the concil of europe ( not to be confused with the european council ) uses the same flag how about a golden circle , or maybe like an outline of europe , or the euro symbol , a big e , anything but meaningless stars . 
  maybe a combination of common european flag designs , maybe put an actual constellation like nz and aus do , that would be pretty cool actucally , esa could steal that flag . 
  anyway back to original point , leaving the eu was also spun as leaving the echr and just about anything else , just listen to anything farage says euro-sceptics often stuck everything non-uk which they did n't like into `` eu '' . 
  they hate all pan european institutions so lump them all into one . 
  at one point a tenuous claim that russia was affecting british laws because of its position in the council of europe ( not to be confused with the european council ) , was widely being publicised as a reason to leave `` europe '' which many would take to mean european union . 
  the brexit vote for one thing , anything eu related was thrown into one big lump, 
  they should probably change the flag ( and anthem ) , the coe ( of echr fame ) and eu ( of 28 member states ) share the same one and it causes no end of confusion . 
  english can into latin, 
  yeah i know you could do that i was just saying that stabbing would probably be more effective , unless you had an actual hammer . 
  i doubt you 'd be able to really pierce armour with a sword hilt as you could a hammer . 
  the man in the video did n't seem to be wearing any protection under his helmet which would n't be a good idea , and we know medieval knights did wear padding under their helmets ( and indeed the rest of their armour ), 
  not really like a hammer , they had hammers for that you can stab people though through gaps in the armour , or knock them off guard and stab them with rondel dagger , they had daggers to penetrate armour , maybe not full plate but certainly eye slits , joins between plates that sort of thing, 
  idk i have been on the internet too long , where everyone is 1/124th irish and therefore has to support the ira whilst drinking guinness of course ( a drink who moved its hq in the 1930 's from the republic of ireland to london and forbade employees marrying catholics until the 1960 's , but ya know your wan na be ira people do n't care about things like history ) its easy for people outside the uk to go around singing the praises of ni paramilitaries ( of any sort ) , but they are n't the ones getting blown up . 
  belgium does n't have one ... is it because it 's a non-country ? 
  they are pretend irish , i am pretty sure i am more irish than americans calling themselves irish , and i do n't call myself irish because i was n't born there , was n't schooled there and do n't live there, 
  how does luxembourg get so much they have loads of money . . at least they would if they were honest in their tax returns, 
  when it comes to castles on jersey , this is one down three to do . 
  i will do the other three later , elizabeth castle , grosnez castle and the finally fort regent ( yes its a fort , but its a biggun ) . 
  we have a fairly decent cpc ( castles per capita ) here , of 1 per 25,000, 
  mont orgueil caslte was originally constructed in the early 13th century to combat raids from france during the period . 
  the castle was taken on only one occassion in 1461 and they held it for seven years , however in 1373 there was a close call where the french were able to take the outer walls and surround the keep however , with the prospect of an english relief force they withdrew . 
  during the tudor period the castle was greatly strengthened , this can be seen today . 
  with the advent of cannon the castle had come in range of the ajacent hill . 
  to attempt to combat this the western walls ( the side we can see in the photo ) were greatly reinforced with their thickness and height being increased dramatically . 
  the keep too was greatly enlarged and strengthened into the large tower we see today . 
  it bears many simularities in its design to other tudor fortifications such as that of deal of walmer . 
  in spite of these improvements the height of the hill was still greater than the top of the keep , meaning in any engagement forces on the hill would be able to shoot down at the castle . 
  due to this weakness new modifications to the castle largely ceased . 
  during the age of elizabeth i the new castle was constructed by sir walter raleigh on a tidal island off st. helier , the islands population centre . 
  mont orgeuil began to decay as a fortress and residence of the governor , in the 17th century it was used as a prison . 
  during the english civil war the castle once again found a use as a fortification . 
  in 1643 the royalists under sir philippe de carteret lost the island and were forced to retreat to their strongholds . 
  sir philippe went to elizabeth castle but his wife anne , and their son ( also philippe ) held mont orgeuil for the crown . 
  an almost year long seige began , however the royalists were kept supplied by george carteret ( he had dropped the ` de ' , nephew of sir philippe ) . 
  it seems there was very little actual fighting during the period of parliamentary rule , several skirmishes were made , and siege works dug , however the primary focus was always elizabeth castle as it controlled the town . 
  in late 1643 george landed near mont orgueil and rallied the local people to him , by this point they were getting a bit fed up with parliament who had been busy changing the nature of the religion in ways they disliked , and also trying to get them to fight people . 
  it was a relatively bloodless uprising , the parliamentarian ring leaders were forced to flee on a small boat . 
  after several years of peace under the rule of george carteret , in 1651 a large parliamentarian force led by col. heane landed on the island . 
  eager not to make the mistake of his predeccessors he had brought heavy artillery with him , and also decided not to punish the royalists too harshly . 
  they defeated the militia 's in st. ouen 's bay and marched on mont orgueil . 
  with the prospect of getting bombarded from the adjacent hill by such weapons the royalists surrendered on favourable terms , and were allowed the freedom to go to elizabeth castle , the last royalist stronghold . 
  in late 1651 elizabeth castle succumbed to parliamentarian bombardment , a heavy mortar shell hit a building in which powder and supplies were stored , forcing the royalists to surrender ( again on very generous terms ) . 
  in the 1920 's the castle was opened to the public . 
  during the second world war the castle once again found use as a fortification . 
  the germans made limited modifications to the old fortress , these can be seen today by the smaller towers atop the keep , which were used for observation . 
  with the end of hostilities , the castle was once again open to the public . 
  it 's called that because every time an army tried to invade they stumbled across this an exclaimed `` what a b * tch '', 
  uh another modern border map ... why not just draw blobs on a blank map to show actual control , then overlay today 's borders . 
  for greater accuracy and a semblance of academic value, 
  up the barbarians whoop !, 
  whoop !, 
  saxons sack !, 
  franks forever !, 
  horrible huns, 
  is it popular in norway ? 
  in the uk its unpopular with the armed forces , the government and probably also the people at large . 
  it was a political hot potato even in ww1 , they held back conscripting anyone until 1916 because they thought it was anti-liberal , so yeah not popular . 
  i always thought the swedish had conscription ? 
  when did they get rid of it , or am i just wrong, 
  there are lots of things an airforce is used for other than shooting stuff down like if an identified aircraft enters your airspace , you ca n't just shoot it down it could be anything, 
  is this crs , from what i can gather the eu still has n't given any ** clear ** guidance on what exactly we need to do . 
  it took them a year to decide on a definition of a `` fund '' . 
  i mean really . 
  its almost 8 years since they first proposed the legislation and it still hasnt been implemented fully yet . 
  we had some people come in and tell us about the rules we would have to follow , they said there were a lot of questions not yet answered by the commission , and the whole crs project was years behind schedule ... 
  i guess thats how the eu rolls . 
  for some reason they seem to be playing their cards close to their chest ... but it makes no sense we have to comply with the legislation so why be so cagey about telling us what we have to do ** exactly ** , i think they eu held question and answer sessions , but you ca n't ask a question or get an answer any time you want , you have to get in a queue . 
  fatca is pretty clear cut , crs is n't . 
  atm it just seems each country is generally trying to do the same thing , but with no real guidance from the top . 
  why do some countries have lots more divisions in them but entirety of england and wales are the same colour .
