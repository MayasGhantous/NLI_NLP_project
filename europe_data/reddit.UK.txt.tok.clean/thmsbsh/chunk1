who 's for an independent london ? 
  with a decent bit of social democracy it could support its 7 millions residents with a proper welfare state without having to keep bailing out wales , scotland and liverpool . 
  or it 'd descend into a dystopian nightmare with boris at its helm . 
  also , bloody poles , coming over here , bringing their cured meats and delicious strong beers , fixing our toilets , etc etc, 
  quite . 
  ** monocle * \\*, 
  * breaking : * obama declares war on schnitzel, 
  clearly been on reddit too long when i thought this was a reference to / r/malefashionadvice, 
  we 're definitely going to have to stay in the eu now if it 'll piss off the french . 
  yeah , in my head they 're semi-legal establishments in the abandoned tunnels of the underground , 
  hopefully if it does comes to pass , there 'll be a market in public and anonymous unrestricted internet access * cyberpunk dreams *, 
  no but they certainly were . 
  a true godwin tends to use hitler/the holocaust where it is n't appropriate . 
  in a discussion on romany oppression , i 'd say it 's not derailing . 
  except all the people in england/wales/ni who do n't want to leave the eu . 
  do n't believe the propaganda , it 's a vocal minority of eurosceptic politicians who base their support off of a population who do n't actually understand what the eu is for . 
  does n't stop it being fun though . 
  got ta reclaim `` i 'm not racist but '' from the racists . 
  perhaps i 'm overstating it . 
  he 's modelling the economy on the nordic countries ( self-reliance with regards to energy etc , strong social policy ) and keeps trying to be bros with them . 
  alex salmond 's pushing for scotland to be considered a nordic country . 
  the dick . 
  i guess / u/replicasex is referring to l'acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise -- those guys really hate ` le sandwich ' . 
  you 're familiar with the idea of secular judaism though ? 
  america 's got loads of non-believing jews , but loads will still avoid pork etc. 
  i guess it 's the false modesty of knowing that , to be quite honest , you 're definitely in the top 10 cultures anyway . 
  probably 5 . 
  also odd that france disagreed so much . 
  but they might be disagreeing in a certain way : they all believe their people * are * perfect , 
  save the animes, 
  probably because russia . 
  and ignorance . 
  also , when it 's cold it 's * very * cold , no ? 
  i think the uk must have the most consistently average weather in the the world . 
  if you presume that `` eastern europe '' means `` poor , cold and prone to eating cabbages '' as it sadly does in the popular english imagination , that 's probably about right ? 
  see , i 've never tried it but i 'd quite like to ? 
  pie and mash and eel liquor , too . 
  such a clich\u00e9 , but proper fish and chips on a beach . 
  nothing better . 
  also , a selection of cold cuts . 
  pork pie , gammon , cheddar cheese , piccalilli , branston pickle , and mashed potato . 
  i always thought the `` no word for yes '' thing was an urban myth !, 
  since it 's translated into irish english quite idiosyncratically . 
  `` will you have a cup of tea ? '', 
  `` i will '', 
  i always like to discover english words that do n't translate well to other languages -- `` awkward '' is one of them . 
  seriously , try explaining the concept of awkwardness to a french , italian or spanish speaker . 
  they just do n't have the concept . 
  what jokes do they tell in kerry ? 
  what would you consider to be a `` fair share '' ? 
  i think our national dislike of france and germany is quite distinct , now that i think about it . 
  broadly , we quite like * france * ^ ( yay croissants and wine ) , but we we hate the french ^ ( garlic-stinkin woman-stealing cheese eaters ) ; we hate * germany * ^ ( two world wars and one world cup ) but think that germans are alright people , really ^ ( reliable , efficient , beer-drinkers ) . 
  although personally , i love all you guys xxx, 
  that actually ... makes a lot of sense ? 
  this makes me so happy , because it 's how we feel about you !, 
  the thing that really brings us together is our mutual hatred of germany . 
  useful tip : anyone who claims not to be a racist is probably quite racist . 
  well , just over 20 % if we 're talking metro area , which in a conversation about gun ownership i 'd say would be the relevant metric . 
  as an ignorant londoner , i stand corrected . 
  apparently france is 22 % outside of urban areas , i 'd have thought the difference was more pronounced . 
  there 's what , 5 million people in scotland ? 
  how many of them have a gun ? 
  rural areas -- * really * rural areas -- do n't count for much in the uk . 
  and we do n't have any wild boars as far as i 'm aware . 
  our biggest predator is the badger . 
  [ it 's really awful ] ( http://www.royalmint.com/newonepoundcoin ), 
  the free movement of people destroying our economy yet again, 
  those 60 english longbowmen made all the difference * tips bascinet *, 
  most brits are kind of chill with the polish now . 
  they 're just big dudes who like to drink a lot , eat cabbage , and provide incredible value for money in the construction trade . 
  hey !, 
  some of us like the eu !, 
  * britain can not into europe *, 
  oh goddammit , i ca n't see an american write china without hearing it in [ trump 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdrfe9i8_hs ) voice . 
  he 's got to me ; _ ;, 
  we 've also both got monarchies , beer and ... naval heritage ? 
  plus you know you invaded like 1600 years ago or something . 
  if britain leaves the eu , i 'm moving to denmark . 
  ... i may need need to think this one through . 
  they also do n't use any of it themselves . 
  lovely fjords . 
  well if you 're the type of person who never leaves their home , then no wonder you 're sour about living in london . 
  but that 's not a problem with the * city * . 
  because despite it being technically the country that i was born in , i do n't feel part of an exclusively english heritage . 
  much the same way that someone who was born in wales may claim to be welsh , and not british . 
  they were born in the uk , for sure , but they do n't * feel * british . 
  this attitude is shown at it 's highest extent in norn ireland , thus showing the problems that arise from nationalism . 
  firstly , it 's my hometown . 
  i was born and raised here . 
  secondly , because it 's the greatest city on earth . 
  now of course that 's hyperbole . 
  but there 's nowhere else like it . 
  every night of every week there 's something to do . 
  too much , in fact . 
  there 's no way anyone could go to every concert , every art gallery , every restaurant and every pub . 
  some nights i cycle home along the river thames and i almost cry when i see how beautiful the city really is , and i feel so lucky to be a part of it . 
  because it 's bigger than me . 
  than any of us . 
  frankly though , i do n't mind when people complain about london 's dirt and high rents . 
  because it keeps those people out of our city .
