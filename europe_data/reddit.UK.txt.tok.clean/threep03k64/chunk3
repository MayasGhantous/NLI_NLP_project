  show westminster how it is done and put a bit of pressure on the bastard politicians who seem intent on gutting anything in the uk that might actually be a source of pride . 
  well for a start scotland is actually a viable country . 
  before i started noticing your posts on / r/europe the british-french mocking really seemed to be a one-sided affair and i was under the impression the french had moved on from that shit . 
  i suppose not . 
  in reality my knowledge of star trek is pretty limited , i never got into it . 
  just googled the ferengi though :  like most of their culture , their religion is also based on the principles of capitalism ... ... perhaps a little . 
  well , that is n't exactly the best article to link to , though this appeared in some newspapers yesterday i think and all it leads me to wonder is that the fuck the police actually spend their time doing . 
  i barely see them out and about ( certainly not outside of their car ) . 
  we 've been hearing for a long time that crime levels are actually decreasing . 
  and i was the victim of a crime and the police thought they could handle that shit over the phone i think i 'd just fucking hang up . 
  that also has the bonus of people inevitably just shorting it to ` the federation ' . 
  and you have experience with a german invasion as well but how about we move on from 1939 . 
   the nato 2 % limit is a joke with small countries . 
  it shows goodwill . 
  why should the major nato countries agree to defend the minor countries if the can not meet the 2 % threshold ? 
  the life of castro absolutely fascinates me and i have read with interest his biography and a lot of the articles he wrote that are posted on * granma * ( which i enjoyed even acknowledging the bias ) . 
  but the cold war is over now . 
  there 's no longer any reason to be spouting any bullshit about the supposedly anti-imperialistic virtues of the soviet union or china , and there is certainly no ideological ( only economic ) reason for castro to now be defending the actions of post-soviet russia as though russia is n't just now doing something that 60 years ago would have probably had castro picking up a gun . 
  the nations of nato are far from perfect ( some of their actions in the kosovo war springs to mind ) , but the current actions of russia only legitimise the fears of the eastern european countries that led to the eastern nato expansion . 
  that 's absolutely beautiful . 
  a bit of a shame about the billboard though . 
  birmingham is fine . 
  i live there , and am just finishing my studies at university of birmingham . 
  i 've encountered loads of foreign students studying here and those i speak to seem to have had a wonderful time . 
  well my first problem with your post is that you are writing as if the french population got together and had a referendum on whether to continue with the sale of the ships to russia . 
  i also think it is a bit hard to call chamberlain a great fool . 
  naive maybe , but he lived in an era when the people just did not want war . 
  i think military integration is unlikely without germany pulling its weight and i 'd love to see greater cooperation between france and the uk with germany as it could really be the foundation for even greater integration ( that could stop any reliance on the us ) . 
  i suppose ultimately though it is for the german people to decide . 
  well , the us is part of nato so it has a commitment to defend the nato states in europe , which i have no problem with . 
  my concern is that nato seems to be dominated by the us and i would like to see greater european cooperation ( using the eu as a framework ) so there is less reliance on the us . 
  in short i think there should be an alliance , not reliance . 
  it 's not the same without the communism . 
  it was the ideological differences that really sold the cold war the first time around . 
  i think / u/executivemonkey has it correct ; if nato is shown to be useless then it calls into question the strength of every american alliance . 
  the alliances with south korea , japan , and taiwan lose credibility , and that gives freer reign to russia and china . 
  if nato were to go to war with russia it would n't be because the major nato nations care so much for estonia ( again , sorry estonians ) , it would be because to not react would be an invitation for a whole lot of instability in the world . 
  uk - yes . 
   does the uk even have classes discussing the european union ? 
  ooh , i 'm curious about this . 
  i 've studied the eu only because i have studied law ( which i have long believed should be a compulsory subject ) . 
  do other eu countries teach about the eu outside of law ? 
  tl ; dr if france does n't enact structural reform it will remain economically weak , which disrupts the balance of power in europe and will lead to a german dominated eu . 
  the uk is still active in the global politics but being a small country ( in comparison to the us , china etc ) that is n't going to last forever , which is why i think greater commitment should be given to greater political and military integration within the eu . 
  still being active in global politics , and with a seat at the security council , i feel that the uk ( alongside france ) * should * be able to lead the way . 
  i appreciate this would be a bloody miracle at this point . 
  having said that i still think there is a place for the uk to question integration . 
  i 'm all for an eventual federal eu myself but i think if it is ever going to happen there * should * be countries that question the direction the eu is taking because it ensures constant discussion on what powers the eu actually have . 
  i would just like the uk to do this in a more cooperative way than currently seems to be done . 
  i never got round to that . 
  i obsessively moved on to wanting to be able to name very country in the world instead . 
  which i managed to do eventually , though i 've probably forgotten at least a quarter of them now . 
   to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power . 
  it 's a black square . 
  that people think it has beauty or emotional power is a joke . 
   it makes no difference if it 's one person or 7 billion that can appreciate it . 
  6.9 billion people could call that black square art and i 'd still disagree . 
  if other people look at that black square and call it art , then it is art . 
  to them . 
  to me it 's a black square . 
  and why is that ? 
  ** nato charter article 5 ** - * the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that , if such an armed attack occurs , each of them , in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by article 51 of the charter of the united nations , will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith , individually and in concert with the other parties , such action as it deems necessary , including the use of armed force , to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area . 
  * or , from the start of the charter : * ... they are determined to safeguard the freedom , common heritage and civilisation of * ** their ** * peoples ... * not to mention that within the nato charter is a confirmation that they intend to comply with their un obligations , which really precludes military action against russia over ukraine . 
   given the danger of washington pushing europe into war with russia , one can be glad that so many europeans see through the perfidious propaganda lies spread by the mainstream media . 
  i ca n't really say i agree with this . 
  i do n't really see how washington has attempted to push europe into war . 
  that aside , america does not frighten me . 
  i am also glad that america is an ally . 
  * however * , i would like it to be an alliance on more equal terms and that is one of the reasons i am all for greater political and military integration within the eu . 
  america is an ally , but it has its own interests and i think it is time for the nations of europe ( through the eu ) to step out of the shadow of the us a little more . 
  no thanks . 
  i think i would be more inclined to consider this line of reasoning if it was a non-nato eu country that was attacked ( on the basis of the greater economic links and ideals of greater cooperation and the ever closer union ) but it is not the place of nato to pit itself against russia over a non-nato nation . 
  putting idealistic views of the ideals of nato aside , nato is a military alliance designed to protect nato nations . 
  it is not an international police force . 
  i find it amusing that people can try to argue along the lines of ` who are you to determine what art is ' and determine what is art and tell me i am wrong . 
  that is n't art . 
  it 's a black square with a lot of pretentious writing accompanying the image . 
  and why the fuck would i feel the need to do that ? 
  yes , but the echr does allow a margin of appreciation that allows for slightly different interpretations dependant upon the ( circumstances of the ) country . 
  when i read the linked article my immediate thought was that if this did ever go to the echr i could n't see this * not * being a breach , but in reality , who knows . 
   please elaborate . 
  what is there to elaborate on ? 
  i would not consider something such as a painting that consists of nothing but a grey square to be art . 
  people can label whatever they want as art and under normal circumstances i wo n't care , but the second the word ` art ' has legal relevance i 'm less inclined to accept the viewpoint that anything can be considered art . 
  this is not to say i agree with this ` artist ' being sentenced however , because that is clearly ridiculous . 
   under article 10 , which gets more protection , political , or artistic ? 
  i studied this earlier in the year and from what i can remember political expression is given more freedom , whereas artistic expression is more limited . 
  a lot of the echr jurisprudence however puts focus on the manner in which views are expressed rather than just the view that is expressed . 
  it also occurs to me however that when i studied this my focus was more on case law about the protection of religion ( not ethnicity ) . 
   what about modernist paintings that are a grey square , is that art ? 
  no  but if you get into deciding if someone can be held liable based on whether or not it is `` art , '' then it is so vague it is insane . 
  from a human rights perspective it actually is relevant whether this is art because article 10 ( freedom of expression ) gives various levels of protection dependant upon the type of expression ( with a distinction made between artistic and political expression for example ) . 
  141/141 but that 's only because this type of thing has been posted on / r/europe in the past and i felt the need to learn after a pretty poor result . 
  i do n't spend a huge amount of time on it but i 'd certainly say it is friendly . 
  there 's been some great posts in the last few months from immigrants and tourists giving their perspective of the uk , which were great to read . 
  / r/unitedkingdom is fine . 
   the reaction from most people elsewhere in the uk has been to ignore the whole thing because independence is a question for the scots . 
  from the perspective of an englishman ( who has followed the debate quite closely ) i feel the discussion has been done to death to be honest . 
  i 'm all for discussing the big events ( such as the debate ) but i feel a lot of the big questions ( nuclear weapons , currency union , eu etc ) are n't going to get an answer unless scotland votes for independence so the debate goes round in circles . 
  not to mention that a huge amount of articles on it at the moment are complete fluff .
