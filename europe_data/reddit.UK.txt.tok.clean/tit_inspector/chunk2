  for literally thousands of years europe was plagued with war and conquest due to `` increased competition '' and self interest . 
  it took two apocalyptic world wars starting in europe to make leaders realise that working together was for the greater good . 
  and the reason they have come to know each other so well in the past half century is because of the eu and it 's predecessors opening borders and trade !, 
  you mean like world war 1 & 2 ? 
  sounds like a great plan !, 
  i think you need to read up a bit on the history of the eu and - how and why it came to be . 
  google it - neither is considered `` correct '' . 
  one is british english ( maths ) and the other american english ( math ) . 
  do you want to start another war ? 
  go directly to america and leave your passport , picture of the queen and union jack with the american tsa who will return the items to the uk where they will be burned and the ashes scattered on cursed ground . 
  and change your flair . 
  you ca n't be allowed to continue this abominable behaviour under our flag . 
  you are a heretic and a scoundrel . 
  did you vote yes or no ? 
   math \\* twitch \\*, 
  i do n't think turkey cares about eu membership anymore . 
  in your post you sounded disappointed we had n't done better . 
  i was apologising for our inadequacy . 
  germany has a woeful military capability . 
  i do n't follow ? 
  he 's probably talking about the one in qatar ( 2022 ) . 
  which was rife with allegations of corruption and bribes . 
  sorry to disappoint you . 
  you can only post 1 link for a story . 
  if its a choice between a respected , unbiased news source and one that 's a well known propaganda machine for a state then its better to go with the unbiased one . 
  i 'm not suggesting to censor rt. 
  feel free to read it , link to it . 
  the op chose not to as his primary source for the story probably because it has a reputation for propaganda . 
  just because it tells ther truth sometimes does n't make it an overall good news source to read . 
  because it 's a propaganda mouthpiece for the russian government . 
  we heard about that over here in the uk . 
  we get all the gory details when germans go mad . 
  like that josef fritzl case . 
  you germans create some seriously crazy people . 
  but russia is a dictatorship . 
  you 've had the same guy ( putin ) running the country for years . 
  you hate gays - which is a very backward viewpoint . 
  you invade other countries with impunity . 
  according to a video i saw of a parody russian music video you 're people still live in villages like borats - e.g. 
  washing your clothes in a river and dressing like gypsies . 
  or they live in moscow - which is one of the most backward 2nd world capitals in the world . 
  china is far more relevant than you because it has a bigger economy , bigger population and a bigger army than you . 
  russia is nothing but a huge wasteland from moscow to the east and it 'd be good for the entire eastern part to be invaded , civilised and industrialised by the chinese . 
  hell - even the mongolians could do a better job with eastern russia than the russians . 
  not guinness ? 
  do cans of guinness still have the little widgets in ? 
  its been many years since i had one . 
  i prefer my translation . 
  do n't you dare link me to the french you non-country grotbag !!, 
   rammstein i love them but i have no idea what they 're singing . 
  which one of these is you ? 
  what does it say in the queen 's english ? 
  danes are more english than german . 
  they 're ours . 
  he said : `` b\u00f6rk , b\u00f6rk b\u00f6rkb\u00f6rk , bork '', 
  according to wikipedia it looks like you ca n't please any of the irish :  ** many irish republicans , and other opponents of partition , avoid calling the state ireland ** . 
  they see it as reinforcing partition and fuelling the perception that ` ireland ' and ` irishness ' are restricted to the republic ( see partitionism ) . 
  ** instead , they often refer to the state as the 26 counties ** ( with northern ireland as the six counties or 6 counties ) and sometimes as the free state ( a reference to the pre-1937 state ) . 
  `` svenskere '' i do n't know which of the nordic languages you 're speaking ( because they 're basically the same anyway ) but i swear i can almost make out what you 're saying : without using a translator it sounds like : * `` we have the best language , some of also in norway . 
  ` swedish ' '' *, 
  you did well for a bosnian speaking english . 
  it worked . 
  same in the uk . 
  no my child . 
  the long summer has passed , and now ... winter is coming, 
  yes but then the uk allowed russia to occupy and install a puppet government into poland . 
  our obligation was only partially fulfilled . 
  when the much bigger , redder enemy rolled it 's tanks into poland we were n't so keen to declare war then . 
  europe needs russia 's gas . 
  you need a real life mikael blomkvist and lisbeth salander . 
  yeeesssss, 
   pieter de crem peter 's cream . 
  what does the croatian text say in the facebook post ? 
  i said it depends where in wales you are . 
  in the north west its over 60 % . 
  parts of west and south west wales are 30-50 % [ map link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:welsh2011w.png ) . 
  source : en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welsh_language it 's also taught in many schools as the first language : `` in 2008/09 , 22 per cent of classes in maintained primary schools used ** welsh as the sole or main medium of instruction ** '' . 
  ** `` lessons in the language itself are compulsory for all pupils until the age of 16 '' ** - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_wales all road and building signs are bilingual ( [ example ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:wales.cardiff.slow.jpg ) ) . 
  i 'd be really grateful if you could stop trying to teach me about my own country . 
  its very patronising . 
   he 's being a little slippery that 's ar ' dave for ya ' . 
   very highely valued ( like plastic bags ) what ? 
  really ? 
  europa universalis iii is insanely complicated . 
  after 2hrs i just could n't get into it . 
  is vermont the socialist state that wants to secede and is full of pine trees ? 
  that 's all i think i know about vermont . 
  it sounds nice - especially the trees and socialism . 
  you did so well ( way better than me ) but then spelt `` canadian '' wrong . 
  i only realised washington and washington d.c. were different in my mid-20 's . 
  i am not a smart man . 
  why on earth do some italians still like him and keep him in power ? 
  he 's more of an international embarrassment than george w bush was for america . 
  zis vud never have happened in de farterland !, 
  you want our rock do n't you ? 
  have you seen the size of the main spanish navy ship responsible for previous aggression - compared to ours ? 
  we have 2 of [ these ` bad boys ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scimitar-class_patrol_vessel ) protecting gibraltar ( 24 ton ) . 
  spain [ sent one of these ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serviola_class_patrol_boat ) ( 1200 tons ) . 
  we could barely board a dinghy with our boats nevermind a fully armed spanish patrol boat . 
  we 've fallen a long way since the glory days of the royal navy ruling the seas .
