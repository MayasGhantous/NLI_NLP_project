  easy mate , we do n't need statistics/facts when a spaniard talks about anybody being wrecked after yesterday . 
  `` england-not all that great imo , but as always they 'll be 12 players for england on the field , with the referee . '', 
  :o . . see you on saturday . 
  `` the cockney accent will disappear from london 's streets within 30 years '' good, 
  do n't forget the fighting in the pacific for a few years against the japanese . 
  they are things of beauty if your drunk . 
  '' we shall combine the baked beans and the sauerkraut into the most formidable culinary weapon that has ever existed . '', 
  well , i may be up for being ruled by germans if we get this in return . 
  pretty good here in europe , healthcare and all that . . hows it going there ? 
  tell that to your government , we certainly do n't you to protect us here in the u.k so you 'll only find me cheering if nothing else than for the reason of not seeing internet showboat words of ` protection ' . 
  i think he/she is saying for the u.k to put troops in romania as a protection from russia and take the lead in what could possibly be a joint european military venture to make sure the russians do n't invade . 
  fair point tbh we probably should have sent troops to eastern europe even if the russians would n't invade just to make it clear that we would support them in the very unlikely event of an invasion . 
  i was fine with what you said until `` a stable europe ? 
  keeping russia at bay ? '', 
  the e.u has kept a stable europe and russia is not a threat to most of europe nor can be a threat to the larger nations let alone the e.u together . 
  russias military budget alone is smaller than just the u.k 's and frances together by a a third , seriously i do n't know how often i have to explain this to americans but russia is not as big of threat as they think and there are plenty of nations in europe capable of slapping the shit out of russia if it came to it . 
  yeah but your not getting the two super carriers that we are . 
  better tech you say ? 
  well that is difficult to say as the u.k co-develops tech or buys it 's tech from the usa . 
  as for submarines , have you seen the trident missle submarines that the u.k uses to hold it 's nuclear weapons . 
  not to mention the brand new type 45 destroyers . 
  as for strategic positioning , in what way is italy strategically positioned , if you mean to dominate the med i should remind you gibraltar guards the only entrance into that sea other than through egypt . 
  not to mention with overseas terroritys around the world that can be used for military bases . 
  i do not see how italy can be better placed . 
  it may not be the imperial era ( thank god ) , but the royal navy still outclasses the italian navy . 
  from what i hear what is a bastard anyway who i would n't want to know . 
  [ oh but yes . 
  i knew you were going to link it but it really is n't true , they used a messed up way of measuring it . 
  nah that 's lie , nowhere near that . 
  70 % is what farage said , which is a load of bollocks i might add . 
  we do trade with canada what on earth are you talking about ? 
  we trade with every country . 
  the e.u may put tarrifs or taxes on certain products of other countries to give other e.u countries the edge but that is it , most other countries do the same as well . 
  hence import tax , nobody is bring it up because it 's not fucking true like most of ukip bullshit figures they come up with . 
  edit : it actually blows my mind you thought the e.u stops us from trading with other countries like canada . 
  11 days ago . . 
  he said 70 ~ of new laws come from the e.u, 
  china is the second biggest economy not japan ... 
  depends , scotland to southern england can take a long time depending on the trains you get ( over 11 hours sometimes ) and what time and day you get them at . 
  as it 's a sunday i would expect it to take longer as there are less trains . 
  our trains suck as well . 
  honestly i do n't think we really care that much , it 's just fun for alot of people here to make jokes about germany because of the world wars so you see alot of press attention when it comes to football ( we love to take the piss and the germans are an easy target pretty much ) . 
  plus you have a good team so it 's a nice benchmark to set yourself . 
  especially in football ( although this has worked in our favour recently ) . 
  there 's something about beating the germans and french that makes it more satisfying . 
  cleanse the unclean, 
  i agree , definitely more international feeling at my university than a national one , which is good because we get more talent and it 's nice to meet people from everywhere all over the world . 
  i imagine the recent stuff with ukip over here in the u.k will probably make us seem less welcoming of immigrants though . 
  that was my thinking as well , much more talent to choose from with students and professors . 
  canterbury christ church university , apparently . 
  never heard of it before . 
  they could n't reach northern england ( several ports ) let alone scotland ( plenty more ports ) from northern france , bombing was not very accurate back then . 
  i mean as in they they had a hard time hitting cities forget ships , all you would have to do is park the rn next to shore with a bunch of flak cannons aiming at the sky to keep the german air force high in the air , to be accurate that means you have to go low , which means your screwed if it 's near shore and they have defenses . 
  this is why in operation overlord we could n't just the shit out of the coast and walk right in . 
  the problem is trying to to get your troops past the rn to the british coast in the first place , even with air superiority it was a long shot . 
  it 's more difficult to accumalate losses when your fighting in aircraft manned with a few pilots rather than infantry because the rn was to powerful for an invasion to be plausible without total air supremacy . 
  also that figure is a load of bollocks , 2 million japanese soldiers dead ( commonwealth/china/u . s ) 4 million chinese soldiers dead as well , 400k commonwealth soldiers dead , 400k u.s soldiers dead . 
  5 million german soldiers dead , 10 million soviets dead . 
  6.8 million soldiers not dead on the eastern front , lets say 4 million german dead on the eastern front out of 5 million , and 10 million soviet soldiers 14 million on the eastern vs 6.8 million in the pacific , africa and western front . 
  how is that 7/8 ? 
  [ wiki page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties#human_losses_by_country ), 
  yeah they played it all out in war games , no idea what hitler was thinking . 
  guess he figured he may of had a chance with air supremacy but even then it was unlikely any invasion would work . 
  i was just gunna post that , good job . 
  foods pretty good up here in manchester as well , got ta love the curry mile . 
  i will leave for australia tomorrow . 
  indeed , got ta love colonial india . 
  indeed . 
  person who i commented on, 
  except in football ... then it 's those dastardly germans we care about , who actually care about the dutch . 
  you guys wonder why we get so annoyed with the rest of you at e.u summits it 's because you all give us the cold shoulder . 
  thus we send another once proud briton off to the cruel deserts of australia , we shall never again speak of nogdam . 
  no worries , we 'll stick an englishman at the head of a colonial army and wallah it 's now an english army . 
  `` the french are very self critical , very negative about the future , and quite unpatriotic '' that sounds an awful lot lik ... 
  i mean ha silly french of course your negative about the future your french . 
  i would say it is as well, 
  i did n't say i believed in god . 
  saying god bless you or bless you in the u.k is n't akin to any religous meaning most of the time . 
  not respecting other peoples oints of views is also a little childish . 
  bless you , read up on them . 
  as in it 's not really that muslim and were not really that christian . 
  also islam and christianity are far more alike than different . 
  it 's 90 % muslim in the same way the u.k is 60 % christian . 
  it 's not saudi arabia . 
  i do n't think you know much about turkey ... 
  pfizer is n't coming to the u.k , the u.k company they wanted to buy rejected their offer because they said it was to low and to make it sound better to the u.k government they said they would move their hq here and preserve jobs . 
  their offer was rejected [ see here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27250795 ), 
  tbh turkey was quite secular before the shit kicked off so i would n't have minded if they joined the e.u. 
  german ... guess the germans are right i am a island german . 
  [ maybe ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj882qyzr-m ), 
  it 's how they hide from the moose and bears, 
  i 'll send the queen to formlise it all , welcome back into the fold . 
  well ... they do n't have nuclear weapons . 
  then we can build a united nati ... nevermind . 
  if you accept becoming a dominion again ... but think about the name ... 
  the ** dominion ** of canada or if you prefer . . just ** the dominion **, 
  you elect a member of parliment who speaks on your behalf , that is how the system works because they are supposed to be much more informed about the decisions that are taking place so we can all get along with our day . 
  the reason for a parliment is so we elect people to make these decisions for us , hence why we vote for them . 
  also known as a stupid idea , we were already bankcrupt from fighting the japs and itialins and germans, 
  we sacrificed our empire to help the rest of europe and you could argue you as well unless you really think you really think the usa could have handled nazi germany , japanese empire and the itialian empire on the usas own ?
