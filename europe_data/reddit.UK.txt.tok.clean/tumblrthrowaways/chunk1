it 's the more secretive powerful ones . 
  how are you gon na squeal on your mates if they 've all seen you sticking your dick in a dead pig ? 
  trust me , if the us gets involved in europe we sure as hell will as well . 
  we actually do n't , but people smugglers probably do n't tell them that . 
  roughly $ 200 in the uk per month ( unless you 're pregnant or have a young child with you ) , vs $ 343.50 in france . 
  shh , do n't tell them or they 'll keep badgering about an eu army !, 
  a few of them would . 
  cameron and rutte are in love . 
  do n't tell anyone . 
  also they 've discussed a shared want for eu reform a few times since both countries wanted out of the eu top up charge in december . 
  [ yet ... ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/radicalised-muslims-in-uk-more-likely-to-be-wellheeled-9754062.html ), 
  i certainly learned about parts of it , the raj and slave trade and ireland especially . 
  maybe it was around a commonwealth games though , that tended to get it discussed . 
  i dunno , where i work i have to serve a hell of a lot of white zinfandel . 
  never underestimate the 30 + ladies . 
  to be fair , you already tried for independence , which i 'm assuming is why you were n't included . 
  seriously though , cornwall ? 
  it 's the uk 's poorest region . 
  good luck to them if they give it a go , but ... 
  scotland/wales/ni wo n't be happy about the flag they used . 
  they already did one for ni anyway . 
  it 's got dots on that map . 
  it 's not like we could have one of these pictures anyway , no point , 
  white cheshire is my favourite . 
  add in that a lot of clegg 's popularity came from student areas and you 're spot on . 
  students liked clegg and the lib dems , but a pledge was n't kept that had very visible consequences for that demographic . 
  she apparently [ did n't like thatcherism because it was n't very caring towards the poor . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/queens-politics-revealed-1355324.html ) i assume she 'd be a bit displeased with what cameron 's doing in general as a result . 
  we beat the french !, 
  that 's how you get punched , not a remain vote . 
  yeah , of course they 're gon na kick out a net contributor, 
  you 're probably great to have on a night out, 
  says the dane . 
  bristol , y u so wavey ? 
  hills though . 
  so many fucking hills . 
  liverpool, 
  the next one 's called gertrude . 
  beautiful . 
  the people are crap down there though , 
  this is fucking terrifying when you 're walking around in the dark . 
  also , the architect has been forced to apologise . 
  he 's still allowed to design more shit though lol, 
  here 's the one in [ london ] ( https://twitter.com/mattleys/status/665536183829716992 ) , from twitter . 
  as children , their wives ca n't legally consent to sex . 
  i wish we were able to focus more on subjects we 're into right from the beginning , maybe have an option block where you 're able to pick which subject to do more of once a week . 
  if you like languages , you use that option block to choose to have extra lessons in a language focused at a higher level of learning , or another one you do n't learn ( for example , because i was in a certain half of the year , i did n't have a chance to learn french at all during high school , while the other half of the year did n't get a chance to learn german ) . 
  if you like science , you use that to have extra science lessons focused at a higher level . 
  and so on and so forth . 
  it seems silly that when we have an education system that ultimately leads to a high level of knowledge in a narrow field , we do n't give kids the chance to play around with specialising before year 10 when they 've picked their gcse options . 
  this is exactly what he wants , and people do n't realise it . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11658810/david-camerons-has-finally-confirmed-that-he-is-pro-european-and-wants-us-to-stay-in.html ) what he 's actually asked for is n't what 's at the core of euroscepticism in the uk . 
  there 's nothing about migration , nothing about benefits , on just one thing about vetos about to get a ukip voter going because he knows merkel will laugh in his face on those . 
  he 's gone for 4 things that he thinks he might get 2 of ( the two statements , rather than any power , most likely ) so he can come back home and say he was a great success and have nice catchy soundbites about europe listening to us . 
  `` you know that thing that you 've always refused to do even as a member ? 
  you 'll do that despite immigration being a major discussion point in your internal politics . '', 
  bloody hell , no wonder we like you denmark . 
  he forgets that you guys kinda have america as well now thanks to the kardashians . 
  i 'm in one of the safest labour constituencies in the country . 
  my mp can literally do whatever she wants and she 'll get in , especially with ukip imploding right now . 
  of all of the countries to come from while commenting on this ... 
  the route from warrington to leicester is the backbone of this country . 
  france . 
  only logical option there is in honesty . 
  [ was this the song ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4kbcm-ls8y ), 
  i think this is the difference , aldi is far more organised than lidl from my experience . 
  i was lazy and used 2011 stats, 
  36 of them . 
  lots of them are in his shadow cabinet . 
  margaret beckett , neil coyle and jo cox ( before her death ) have said they regret it . 
  clive efford resigned from his shadow cabinet . 
  frank field said he ca n't win a ge and did it to force the party to face its ` deficit denial ' . 
  louise haigh and sadiq khan campaigned for owen smith . 
  [ here 's him calling them his friends ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgj1phewifq ) . 
  essentially . 
  yeah , an advantage of the collies is that they do n't need to touch the sheep to herd them ( they use their eyes ) , and they 're able to work alone . 
  no bears , no wolves , no lynxes in the uk , so the oes can lumber around on dulux adverts happily while the collies do the work . 
  they 're able to take care of foxes and other dogs . 
  because having an eu army on our doorstep once we 're out is not in our best interests . 
  so while we 're in , we 'll delay it as long as possible . 
  ` we 're still paying the entrance fee and subsidising poorer members for now ', 
  this is the [ old english sheepdog ] ( http://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/gallery/old-english-sheepdog-dog-breed-pictures/size-10.jpg ) but we typically use [ border collies ] ( http://www.zastavki.com/pictures/originals/2013/animals___dogs_border_collie_standing_on_a_snowbank_051012_.jpg ) these days, 
  sure it would . 
  but would that be putting it up for a lot of countries to 2 % , or bringing down everyone 's to germany 's 1.2 % since they 're the most powerful in the entire bloc ? 
  that 'll make a massive difference to the strength of an eu army and willingness to join . 
  who 's a bigger target for people who might want a war , greece or germany ? 
  depends on income !, 
  certainly not as much as the us . 
  twice a week maybe myself ? 
  weekly big shop to fill the fridge freezer and cupboard , things like bread/milk two extra times a week . 
  yes . 
  chilled ready meals are fairly popular , frozen slightly less ( although iceland specialises in cheap frozen stuff ) . 
  in general , the poorer the family , the more reliant they are on them . 
  depends . 
  homemade is cheap , but sometimes it can be cheaper to get a prepared version of certain meals . 
  certain vegetables are more expensive than others , things we do n't have to import ( eg . 
  potatoes ) are cheap . 
  aldi and lidl are cheap for fruit veg but they are n't stellar quality unless you buy them the day they come in . 
  your bread is really sweet , your fruits are massive but are n't as strong tasting , massive portions eating out and i was expected to take stuff home with me .
