  i 'm not particularly confident in her , and i do n't approve of where we 're going , but i 'm more confident in her than i was in july 2016 back when i thought we 'd be completely fucked within the year . 
  so lee kuan yew of singapore . 
  he turned singapore into a police state , there 's still no real opposition in government , locked people up without trial , silenced the media etc. 
  however , the right to free speech and expression is protected in singapore , it 's the happiest asian country , has an exceptionally functional health and social care system , plenty of his laws were progressive ( abortion legal in 1970 ) and it 's the most open economy in the world , which he took from a third world british colony to one of the most developed countries in the world . 
  good on them . 
  we should follow them . 
  obviously if there 's genuine concerns about the childs health ( eg . 
  immunosuppressed , anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine ingredient ) then those children neednt be vaccinated . 
  but if everyone else is vaccinated , herd immunity will be high enough to offer them secondary protection anyway . 
  why are you buying materials if you 're not preparing to defend anyone lol look at the mainlander using slurs . 
  so civilised , us brits just ca n't compete . 
  ca n't wait until our papers have scandals breaking about the meme facebook pages that mps liked in their teens and never gave up, 
  what do you think an eu army is meant to be for ? 
  it 's pre-emptive defense . 
  imagine if ireland got invaded by some country outside of the eu and nato . 
  the uk would mobilise to defend them - this is partly why we have such a large army . 
  it benefits us to stop whoever 's invading ireland because we share a land border with them ( at least for now ) , we 're probably next on the list of who 's getting invaded if they 're trying it with ireland , there 's a lot of common identity , and we trade with them a hell of a lot . 
  those same benefits of allyship are n't present for someone from spain if russia starts invading estonia , and a ` european ' identity is still niche , as prevalent as it is on this sub . 
  because most of the eu 's population do n't want more federalisation . 
  what 's going to motivate a bulgarian to go to war and risk his life for the honour of germany ? 
  in wartime people join the forces to protect their family and country . 
  not for a land they have no tangible connection to . 
  how is him winning eurovision a victory against that evil music industry ? 
  he 's said it in the context of a music competition that he won . 
  stop trying to protect your precious eurovision winner . 
  he 's been a knob . 
  we 've been like this since well before 1997 . 
  we sent katrina and the waves . 
  we 'd send my lovely horse . 
  ireland has more wins in the contest than anyone else and the uk has multiple wins lol, 
  [ have one from 1965 then !,

  yeah ? 
  they 're a band made up of boys . 
  look at [ the marketing of the time ] ( https://jonmwessel.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/beatles-lunch-box.jpg ) . 
  look at [ the audience at their concerts ] ( http://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/longform/stories/beatles1964/img/beatles_concert_crowd.jpg ) . 
  they were a boyband . 
  yeah i was so proud of katrina and the waves back in 1997 and that was the only year eurovision meant anything / s there 's a reason we do n't send any of our popular artists despite being the only eurovision country dominating the music industry worldwide . 
  one of the best songs eurovision has ever produced . 
  erik saade 's ` popular ' was fortunately not quite popular enough . 
  and plenty of eurovision competitors were never in . 
  imagine coming on a sockpuppet account with a total of 2 posts , one 3 years ago and one 5 years ago purely to make a joke that is n't really relevant . 
  sad . 
  that it 's not really russians hacking everything , it 's truly azerbaijan ? 
  favourite european country , we should join a union with them, 
  12 points, 
  he was talking about his competitors by saying that him winning was a victory for real music . 
  he was a knob with that , because it heavily implies that others winning would n't be . 
  there 's no grace in his win . 
  hope he only listens to music from composers that were n't popular or paid well when they were alive !, 
  i love eurovision , but i hate denigrating your competitors and proclaiming that you 're ` real ' and they are n't . 
  also , i thought his song was a load of boring shite . 
  1988 is hardly recent, 
  he got us nowhere this year either . 
  no points from you lads :'(, 
  it 's the international version of going onto x factor and proclaiming that you 're the savior of music if you win . 
  he is no better than anybody who used that platform before him . 
  [ best battle ever ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_swally ), 
  we should have given all the non eu countries our points . 
  12 + 3 + 2 + 1 - australia 10 - moldova 8 - armenia 7 - norway 6 - belarus 5 - azerbaijan 4 - ukraine, 
  `` oh , these awful boybands and mainstream music are polluting music !, 
  i listen to real artists , like the beatles and kiss , who were neither boybands nor mainstream at any point ! '', 
  ours was actually alright really . 
  she 's the girl who lost a sing off to jedward on x factor so you can take pride in that, 
  that by being there , he 's as much fast food music as [ this bloke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vghwfiavqja ) . 
  he 'll be forgotten in a month . 
  it 's eurovision , so it pretty much is, 
  ireland did n't do shit for us this year . 
  we 're not really too far behind . 
  next year we 'll send harry styles , you lot send westlife and australia can send kylie . 
  we 'll see who 's laughing then . 
  `` a victory for real music '' he said as he stood on the eurovision stage sometimes i wonder if only ireland and the uk realise the truth about eurovision, 
  thanks !, 
  it 's me , but i 'm put at a slight advantage by living close to liverpool . 
  that back of the throat chchchhchchch is a staple there anyway !, 
  prove it . 
  traditionally , us brits just shout the word ` squirrel ' increasingly loudly until somehow they suddenly understand , [ but i gave it a go for the germans ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s0ndeiaawsoj ), 
  you 're also a hero, 
  you 're a hero, 
  fucking hell , we 're getting sun lads !, 
  we 're getting sun !, 
  [ it 's all getting a bit political ] ( http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_630_noupscale/591079ce1400001417f8bc58.png ), 
  i 've not said a word about the eu27 , and i 've already said i voted remain . 
  i 've said that the eu as an institution is at risk if the uk is successful post-brexit . 
  nobody has ever left the eu before , but holding the eu as something so sacred that it should never be left is absurd . 
  if people are genuinely unhappy , then we should leave . 
  the eu is no divine being . 
  we have no demonstratable evidence that the eu is all that makes the uk successful - so lets see how it goes . 
  we can be the pilot study . 
  stuff like this is why there is a kneejerk against the eu . 
  europhiles like yourself would rather denigrate a country and antagonise potential future partners than continue a working relationship , as you 've shown by saying you 'd rather wto rules despite it being bad for both parties . 
  you 're winning nobody over . 
  i voted remain , actually . 
  but the doomsday predictions that were brought on by brexit have n't happened . 
  leaving a free trade union might be a success . 
  unless you 're holding onto a crystal ball there , we genuinely do n't know . 
  moving further from the eu , trading with brics and increased financial clearing with other countries might be a good thing for us . 
  do i think the likelihood of that is high ? 
  i 'm reckoning that we remain the same as we are now with a few years of wages staying stagnant . 
  but if it turns out that we do well you ca n't pretend that other countries wo n't be questioning their membership too .
