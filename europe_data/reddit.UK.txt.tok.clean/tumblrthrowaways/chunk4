  downwards wage pressure . 
  increased demands on local services , such as schools , getting a family doctor and getting appointments , getting a dentist . 
  rising house prices leading to them being unable to buy a home , even though they have a job . 
  increased costs to the nhs due to a demand for translators at the tune of around # 100m a year according to some sources . 
  i love that we 're holding everyone hostage and being spoiled princesses when it 's everyone else 's politicians deciding this, 
   are not the conditions the same for everyone ? 
  someone unfamiliar with the uk may be less likely to know the uk channels to go through if their working conditions are not what they need to be under eu law . 
  no going through the proper channels = no change . 
   42 children in his class fucking yikes . 
  [ i wonder what that could mean ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuwnmcsydwq ), 
  worth noting that it 's been [ pretty stable for the past few weeks , if low ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=usd&amp;view=1m ) . 
  we 've not had another sudden drop like the headline suggests . 
  the picture they used at the top of this article cracks me up . 
  cameron looks so confused by his hands . 
  so with this logic , [ if we destroy ukip we do n't brexit ? 
  do you really think expanding the euro would go down well ? 
  i prefer to surf on horsea , since it 's about 40cm long . 
  that [ history of japan video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5ly4mz15o ) is my main source of knowledge, 
  look how big we are, 
  how did we take a step in taking control of the eu ? 
  i thought we did the reverse ... 
  the last rte/bbc cross border survey put support for a united ireland if it meant taxes had to be raised at [ 31 % for roi and 11 % for ni ( page 156 ) ] ( http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/tv/nolanshow/rte_bbc_ni_cross_border_survey.pdf ) . 
  the percentage may have jumped since brexit , but i do n't think it will have been enough for either of them to have a majority . 
  with east/west germany , this would have been higher . 
  because it took 15 years for germany to get sustainable levels of growth after that . 
  and because [ ni 's tax deficit is about a third of their total fiscal output ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/northern-ireland-is-officially-one-of-uks-costliest-regions-as-fiscal-deficit-hits-9bn-30152040.html ) - westminster covers this right now but if there was reunification it 'd be down to ireland . 
  oh god , this is asking for trouble ( s ) . 
  they think that people ( correctly ) saying that random eu politicians do n't get a say on when article 50 gets invoked is us wanting ` special treatment ' . 
  they want us to do it now , before the civil service has finished planning out an eu exit and figured out what we actually want out of it . 
  almost like they forget what happened to the economy when we last made a big move on europe with no plan ... 
  it comes under that . 
  you 're not fans of the deal we had or us being unwilling to compromise on certain things , so you 're not going to be sad we 're leaving . 
  we wanted different things out of the eu . 
  i say this as someone who voted remain . 
  it did n't seem like we were getting what the majority of voters wanted out of the eu , so now we 're leaving . 
  it 's business , not an attack on the eu itself like some of our voters and some people on the continent think . 
  it 's going to cause a massive amount of people to flee the country if erdogan continues . 
  when people are banging on and on about immigration and asylum , the threat of that would push leave higher . 
  and do you really think the casual voter understands our veto rights ? 
  any mention of an eu army is political suicide in this country . 
  if hollande had been banging on about it last month , then leave would have been higher . 
  sorry you 're having a shitty time . 
  i doubt you 're going to change the minds of people who say these things and upvote them . 
  for whatever reason , they see brexit as a slight against them personally and that 's where it comes from . 
  alternatively , they just were n't a fan of the uk anyway , which is fine . 
  there 's plenty of countries i 'm no fan of . 
  we do n't need any goodwill . 
  nor will asking for it bring us any . 
  we need mutual benefits with the eu - we have things they 'll want from us in an exit agreement , and they have things we want from them . 
  however well those things align will determine what deal comes up . 
  charity is n't going to be something on offer , nor should we expect it , and we should give none in return . 
  additionally , keep in mind that nobody on / r/europe is involved in these negotiations anyway . 
  what they think does n't matter . 
  they can yell and yell on reddit about how they think their future eu army should invade the uk and how donald trump is going to bend to merkel 's will and publicly fuck nigel farage on telly , but they have n't got a say , no matter how much they 'd like to have one . 
  on this issue we 100 % get to be . 
  when to submit article 50 is a uk decision , nobody elses . 
  merkel agrees with us . 
  thanks , changing my answer now, 
  because she 's going to live forever to keep charles out , you ungrateful swine . 
  besides , she was alright in her younger days . 
  yes 6 . 
  yes - medical . 
  medical . 
  i voted remain , but i expect the leave percentage would be higher were the referendum done today instead of last month . 
  especially with turkey and the terror attacks . 
  god help us if an eu army had been mentioned earlier . 
  because we 'd be a member of nato ( who actually spends enough on defence ! ), 
  under attack . 
  shocking , i know . 
  the 52 did n't say anything about a time . 
  and actually , [ 95 % of leave voters are happy with their decision . 
  ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/new-brexit-survey-reveals-how-8441926 ), 
  who said it 's time to deliver ? 
  the french ? 
  it 's pissing off the french , and you know we absolutely * live * for that . 
  we still have n't enacted article 50 . 
  still our business , 
  there 's no point starting them with him , [ considering he 's unlikely to be there in a year . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election,_2017 ), 
  they complain about the uk 's eu membership because it 's unequal to everyone else 's , but they ca n't see why people are annoyed about the inequality in nato financing . 
  considering how / r/europe is very upset that we do n't buy into all the shit bits of the eu and get benefits back regardless , they get very annoyed when it 's suggested that people might not want a military alliance where everyone does n't put the same level of financing in . 
  the explanation is `` we do n't want to do it yet , and it 's up to us . '', 
  polonaise and mazurka are studied part of the royal academy of dance ballet syllabus under the character section ( alternatively you can pick russian or hungarian dances ) . 
  when i studied it under that , they really emphasised clicking heels . 
  rad has just had fun with the theme i think lol examples of the syllabus : * [ mazurka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj3uzuok8xi ) * [ polonaise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbta4jf9diy ), 
  fair play , i remembered this being a sticking point particularly for the uk when an eu army was brought up and france and greece being the other two mentioned . 
  good luck to estonia , greece and poland with it then , since they seem to be committing to their defence budgets . 
  i personally would n't want to be in an army with countries who have reduced theirs ( eg . 
  belgium , from the nato report ) , and so far have n't acted on their promises to raise it . 
  ballet class lied to me about a polonaise lol, 
  you do n't go to a foreign country where the rhetoric is ` these foreigns telling us what to do ! ', 
  and then tell them what to do . 
  it was a stupid political move . 
  especially when you ca n't hold onto your threat . 
  he 's gone in november . 
  we need to appreciate that france is wanting to do this with a [ bunch of countries who refuse to meet their nato spending target ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/jul/08/uk-defence-spending-to-be-kept-at-2-of-gdp ) . 
  i hope if they go ahead then they 'll ensure france does n't get taken for a ride with this . 
  i 'm happy to hand them over , they 're bloody expensive to keep . 
  it 's them you have to convince , 
  have a look at their post history , they 're always like this .
