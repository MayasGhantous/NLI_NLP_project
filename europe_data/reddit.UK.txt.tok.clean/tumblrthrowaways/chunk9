  so we were n't bottom . 
   laugh in french honhonhon, 
  [ charles salvador ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_salvador ) did it for marriage . 
  [ teaboos eat our culture the fuck up ] ( http://captainchancey.tumblr.com/post/123573940250/quirkybrittany-i-want-to-study-at-a-british ), 
  i ca n't believe she assumed our gender , the fucking shitord, 
  well he was a brit ... 
  i 'd be interested to see a graph of that versus tobacco taxation rates . 
  i know we have the highest rates in the eu ( # 4.16 + 16.5 % of retail price per pack of 20 + paying vat of 20 % ) and i 'd expect the scandinavians have high rates too . 
  or your shits are just boring . 
  wtf i love the church now, 
  tariff free waifus for all !, 
  thanks , glad to see charles and camilla getting giggly at inuit performers did n't offend you all too much canada, 
  red white and blue graphs, 
  not the worst billboard vandalism i 've seen , but [ not the best ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01563/cameron_1563312c.jpg ), 
  that 's not what they 're sold it as . 
  they 're told that a parcelforce owner driver makes around # 35-40k annually . 
  but they 're not told when they go for it that they have to fork out # 250 if they 're off sick for a day , that they 're going to have to pay for fuel/insurance/upkeep , the route they get is key to how they 'll earn ( highly populated , small area = lots of drops per hour , if they get somewhere rural it 's much harder to earn ) , they have to pay out for the franchise etc etc etc. 
  income vs expenses is why the wage rockets down . 
  she locked her sister in the tower of london only to be [ succeeded by her ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/darnley_stage_3.jpg/800px-darnley_stage_3.jpg ), 
  we all stand in a row and have a piss . 
  girls use union jack printed she wees, 
  lol no it wo n't, 
  english speaking 2 . 
  you lads like europe more than us 3 . 
  liz would n't want us on here, 
  ouija boards need to have a cup big enough for a rich tea biscuit to be fully dipped in if you want to communicate with a british ghost . 
  the eu has them . 
  however , the cladding used was fine under eu regs - but not under german internal regs , and apparently not in the uk at the height they were used . 
  he 'll aim them through the window towards juncker 's office, 
  david davis is going to make loud fart noises throughout . 
  neither are in a majority government . 
  tories have to go with the dup who want soft brexit . 
  if that breaks down , the only other people who can keep them in power are pro remain . 
  but the poll says it is . 
  soft brexit  hard brexit  remain . 
  53 % said they 'd like there to be another referendum though . 
  yeah , voters are n't quite that thick . 
  also , leaving in some form is now more popular than it was during the referendum . 
  we 'd go from a result that supports soft brexit to a more extreme one that supports a hard one purely out of spite for that political shitshow . 
  ukip 's as good as gone . 
  yes . 
  that 's literally what i 'm saying . 
  we ca n't stay in the eu because the majority of voters went with leave . 
  but we can make it soft . 
  because people are n't happy with the current situation . 
  i voted remain , but i know that we ca n't just ignore 52 % of voters . 
  eea access is the compromise . 
  no need to commit to ever closer union , fisheries protected , shit like that . 
  however we single market access . 
  there 's the caveat that we 're probably going to be paying the same amount for less say , and that we 'll need to keep freedom of movement , but it represents a 52/48 split better than remaining in the eu or hard brexit . 
  different methods . 
  yougov 's did a seat by seat analysis . 
  do n't forget that we also have disabled mps who have been campaigners in the past . 
  lots of the mansion owners do n't have uk voting rights . 
  we did n't want to give may a landslide because she 's shit and could n't be bothered turning up to anything . 
  she went straight for hard brexit on the back of a 52/48 result . 
  as much as i hate the dup , their soft brexit stance is a bit more representative than what she was going to do herself . 
  you must be earning over # 18600 per year to bring over your spouse . 
  for a spouse and one child this rises to # 22400 , and # 2400 for each additional child from then on . 
  this must be for a minimum of 6 months before you can bring them - so op would need to move over here , earn their money for 6 months , then bring spouse over . 
  through the eu route , op can move to france/spain/etc , bring their wife when they come , work for 3 months and then they can move to the uk together . 
  no , she called it because she had a 20 point lead and got greedy . 
  the level on which the conservatives won back parts of scotland was n't really predicted at all . 
  uncertainty is scary innit, 
  considering how proud scotland was of having less tories than pandas , she 's smashed it . 
  england has had a fairly big swing towards labour and they 've taken a lot of tory safe seats dup and uup will be the final deciders , ruth smashing it in scotland is what 's tipped the balance, 
  depends . 
  front benchers do n't , but theres multiple rebels ( corbyn was one , good examples now are dennis skinner and jacob rees-mogg ), 
  scots and ni are going to ensure a tory government lol, 
  yep . 
  student constituency , corbs is offering free tuition fees while clegg gave them 9k fees . 
  stock markets are reacting to a shock . 
  they were told it 'd be a tory landslide and it has n't been . 
  [ well actually ... ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/uk-general-election-2017/ ), 
  that was her mo , but she did n't actually do it . 
  she 's slashed police numbers and she 's actually fairly pro-immigration . 
  remember , she was pro remain . 
  her opponent was a thinly veiled leave voter . 
  because she cut police numbers every single year as home secretary . 
  also , the attacker was reported by his community during her time as home secretary . 
  fuck all was done . 
  amber rudd was saying back at the beginning of the month that she refused to rule out cutting numbers further . 
   i hope they 're being paid well !, 
  who 's gon na tell this one ... 
  you do n't . 
  if you make 100k as in your example : * # 11500 tax free * # 33500 at 20 % - # 6700 in tax * remaining # 55000 at 40 % - # 22000 in tax overall that 's # 28700 in income tax , or 28.7 % ni comes out to # 5520.32 so your total take home is # 65,779.68 . 
  keeping nearly 66 % of your salary . 
  a two speed europe , joint border control and less sitting on their laurels . 
  those countries who want to federalise more should go for it . 
  but those who do n't ( they 're there , denmark is like us and would n't accept the euro ever , netherlands , plenty of eastern states ) should be able to go for an economic union which was what most signed up for in the first place . 
  if the eu referendum had been run in summer 2015 then leave would have won by a larger margin . 
  the approach taken to it was a shambles . 
  we were criticized for our stance of taking refugees directly from camps and focusing on the neediest . 
  meanwhile , you had merkel inviting people to take a punt on their lives , get on a rickety boat across the mediterranean and walk through numerous countries to get to germany . 
  additionally , plenty of people treat the eu as too big to fail . 
  brexit blindsided them . 
  how dare a country have the audacity to vote to leave !, 
  that 's got to stop . 
  the eu needs to actively promote itself , why it 's beneficial and engage with citizens . 
  because she 's triggered article 50 and none of the predictions about immediate economic collapse as soon as that happened came true .
