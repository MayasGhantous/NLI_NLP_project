uk here ( english ) . 
  everyone else speaks english . 
  being monolingual is almost required . 
  that said , i flit between languages like nobodies business . 
  strongest in norwegian , some phrases in bulgarian , even less phrases in french and german ( despite having school qualification in french too ) . 
  learnt some hiragana , katakana and kanji at home/in japan and learnt the korean alphabet last week for a laugh . 
  also interested in esperanto . 
  struggling to find a language i like because i ca n't begin to describe my hatred for grammatical case and grammatical gender . 
  such stupid concepts . 
  is this your honest viewpoint ? 
  they left a war-torn country where they feared for their safety . 
  they are passing ** through ** safe countries . 
  they ca n't be that scared . 
   thank you uk for harry potter , your humor , losing on penalties , etc humour *  germany : thank you for having an oddly attractive language that i find impossible to learn . 
  norway : thank you for having such a beautiful language that i 'm horribly butchering as i learn it . 
  i need to visit your stunning beauty soon , and hope to find a fair temptress to marry and become enveloped in your land . 
  had a quick try of this - think i still prefer bulgarian ; it has more of a european touch to it 's grammar . 
  ah yea , i had n't considered environmental factors . 
  i do n't walk in the uk as i 'd be drenched in rain !, 
  as you probably walk at ~ 4mph , you 'd probably be equal in time by just walking ? 
  in bulgarian ( a slavic language ) the gender is almost always decided by the last letter of the noun . 
  if it ends in a consonant , it 's probably a masculine word ; ends in - a or - ya ( the backwards r ) , it 's probably feminine ; if it ends in another vowel like - i or - o then it 's probably neuter . 
  so some other languages have it easier ( at least for deciding gender , i 'm disregarding the complexities of the rest of the language ) . 
  i hate grammatical gender and case ( der  den ) . 
  pain in the arse when trying to learn another language and seems relatively pointless ( probably biased as a native english speaker where gender and case is all but abolished ) . 
  are you in northern norway ? 
  i 'm going through the norwegian course on duolingo and some self-teaching with other resources and i 'm yet to deal with book as a feminine noun . 
  most of the resources suggest that lumping masculine and feminine nouns together as `` common '' gender seems to be accepted now ( as someone pointed out below for swedish ) and i honestly ca n't recall book being taught as feminine , even if the rule is ignored . 
  i 've always seen `` en bok '' . 
  however , i have a friend in northern norway ( near mo i rana ) and she gets so annoyed if i say sengen instead of senga . 
  i tried learning bulgarian a few times . 
  i found it to be quite difficult grammatically , but at least the writing/pronunciation matches and grammatical genders are easy to deduce , unlike the arbitrarily assigned ones in other romance languages . 
  just like david cameron was . 
  oh , that 's right , we do n't elect pms directly . 
  well i 'm a native english speaker who 's ( attempting ) learning norwegian , if you want to start a casual language exchange ? 
  i 'm also well aware of the privileged position i 'm in as a native english speaker . 
  i do n't really have to learn another language , as english is a huge second language for people all over the world . 
  this means i can , generally , communicate with a lot more people and not have to learn their language . 
  for example , my learning of norwegian is almost entirely redundant - there 's only about 5m people in norway , a good majority of which speak excellent english , so my `` return on investment '' is very low . 
  that said , i know a couple of `` nicety '' phrases in other languages ( such as arabic to speak to the local shopkeepers ) - it 's great seeing the smiles on people 's faces when you try to say a few phrases in their native language, 
  i do n't like to hear it any more than i would have any other killing . 
  i 'd still prefer , if i can use that word , that we were dealing in cases of single incidents of a lone psychopath , rather than hearing about repeated or coordinated attacks based on a flawed , fundamentalist view . 
  i think it 's single-figure percentage for the armed divisions of each police force , even in london . 
  in general , no . 
  we do allow the possession of firearms but it involves licenses and is strictly regulated - you 'll typically find a lot of farmers and their mums have guns . 
  i 'm aware there 's a `` black market '' though so people * can * get hold of them if they had a huge desire . 
  i 'm hoping this is just a domestic incident , involving the garden-variety nutter . 
  i saw talk of more than a few tory and labour mps splitting to form a new centrist party . 
  i doubt this would happen but certainly could be an interesting development . 
  i 've begun converting myself completely to metric . 
  my car is set to km , i know my height in metres , i now weigh myself in kg etc. 
  i do n't drink so the lack of pints does n't bother me at all . 
  might be moving to usa in a couple of years though , so all my glorious work will be undone . 
  i despise that we do n't use km and m for distances , it 's absolutely barmy . 
  almost as barmy as me moving to usa in a couple of years and going back to completely imperial . 
  apart from metric for guns . 
  i wanted to intentionally say `` can i learn to bulgarian ? '' . 
  i guess it does n't quite translate , 
  i hope my limited bulgarian is funny here . 
  the law states an eu member ca n't negotiate deals with other eu members . 
  so yes , even after article 50 , we 're an eu member so therefore ca n't negotiate until we 've exited . 
  meantime means the same as meanwhile : `` in the intervening time period '' . 
  it 's referring to the time after brexit but before an eu-uk deal . 
  did you even read the article ? 
  it 's against the law for us to start making trade deals until we 've left . 
  it 'd be great , but if the laws are taken at face value it 's illegal for us to negotiate trade until we 've exited . 
  can see us being made an example of , so we 'll get a pretty rough deal . 
  according to the article , it 's actually against eu law for us to negotiate our deals before leaving the eu . 
  so yea , we 're pretty fooked . 
  if our future prime minister does actually invoke article 50 , we 'll be made an example of , for sure . 
  we ** ca n't ** start any trade negotiations in the two-year period after article 50 , regardless of the disentanglement taking two years or more . 
  watch `` the thick of it '', 
  esperanto , then ? 
  737 for ryanair , 
  1 month `` hat devouring '', 
   he 's going to damage his party massively no matter what . 
  in the worst-case scenario , he 's also going to be the pm when the uk breaks up when scotland try to secede again . 
  i believe it 's the same in bulgarian too ( \u0432\u0438 vs \u0412\u0438 - in written language , of course ) . 
  if it 's plural , it 's lowercase and if it 's formal singular then it 's capitalised . 
  den hele spr\u00e5k  i need immersion to actually learn it . 
  i 'm only learning to read and write , i 've never actually spoken norwegian to a native - i 'm scared as hell of it because i know my accent will be terrible . 
  norway . 
  beautiful people , beautiful land , beautiful language . 
  i 'm trying to learn norwegian so `` gim me som ' dat ` mersion '' . 
  fecking glagoli  there 's a few extra aspects/tenses that i found extremely confusing . 
  i 'm happy enough that each person has a different form ( gavorya , gavorish etc ) as it 's the same in german . 
  the almost-free word order and the insane amount of rules for creating the plural forms of nouns was confusing too . 
  ( i 've been spoilt in english and norwegian on this front ), 
  as a native english speaker , learning most other languages is pain when only introducing grammatical gender ( edin , edna , edno in bulgarian ) , let alone cases too . 
  i started with german , but found the cases ( der hund  den hund etc ) too much on top of arbitrarily assigned grammatical gender . 
  i then started a little bulgarian , and whilst that was much easier with just grammatical gender ( mostly determined by the final letter of the noun ) i found other aspects of the language too difficult . 
  i 've now moved on to norwegian . 
  and whilst is has grammatical gender ( either 2 or 3 depending on who you 're talking to ) , it does n't have case except for personal pronouns like in english , and grammatical structure is also very similar to english . 
  it 's `` sitting '' much nicer in my head . 
  the issue i 've had with both bulgarian and norwegian is lack of materials and teachers . 
  with bulgarian i had only a booklet and a native bulgarian fianc\u00e9e , and i 'm at a similar quandary with norwegian - i only have a booklet and duolingo . 
  i 've looked at resources like hellotalk and italki but due to the lack of speakers , there are n't many teachers of either of these languages , only 8 teachers of norwegian and 4 of bulgarian . 
  however , if i go back to german there 's like 155 , and if i switch to japanese ( i know a little ) then there 's 124 . 
  pretty much, 
  i do not drink , so no , i was eventually un-tarred from this brit brush,
