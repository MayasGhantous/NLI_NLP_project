  they simply saw a large number of people who did n't look like them entering the country and this was a big change for them , and it 's a human survival instinct to fear change . 
  it does n't justify racism , do n't get me wrong , but it serves to explain it . 
  nevertheless , this is where the link between talking about immigration and being racist comes from . 
  and because of this , if you talk about immigration , you are racist . 
  as i said before , this is complicated by * actual * racists talking about immigration , but if you approach with an open mind it 's not actually difficult to tell them apart . 
  so along comes the european union , and its strange policy of simultaneously having free movement of people , and an eastward expansionist policy into the former communist countries , at a time where the population is n't particularly low ( like , say , just after a world war ) , and there 's a massive differential in wealth , living standards and pay not just between the established middle class of britain ( britain being a notoriously class-ridden society with a huge rich-poor gap ) and the working class , but also between the working class of britain and the working classes of eastern europe . 
  this sparks a rising anti-immigration sentiment amongst the working classes ( of which i 'm not a member ) who not only are being shafted by the rich in their country , but their place is also being taken at the bottom by immigrants . 
  rightly or wrongly , this is going to create tension . 
  but because talking about immigration is taboo in the political sphere , nobody is willing to do anything about it , and the eu carries on as normal . 
  parties like the bnp , or pseudo-organizations like the edl show up , harnessing this anti-immigration sentiment to their own ends . 
  and this are actual proper racist groups , reinforcing the idea that talking about immigration is something only racists do . 
  anti-fascist groups campaign against them , and rightly so ( although said anti-fascist groups are not beyond criticism themselves ) . 
  next comes ukip . 
  it 's already a more respectable face of the anti-immigration movement in british politics ( like i said before , it 's not hard to tell the difference between racists and non-racists who are concerned about immigration if you just pay attention , so few people are willing to though ) . 
  but it campaigns on the platform of immigration . 
  i think ukip play themselves too much into a hole by not expanding their philosophy more publically - right now all they talk about is immigration and how racist they are n't because of all the black candidates they have ( which has never really been convincing ) . 
  this is the main reason why i would n't vote for them , given that the rest of their policies are n't to be taken seriously ( this is n't a comment , the leader said this though i paraphrase ) . 
  note that while ukip is not a racist party , it is as the most anti-immigration almost-mainstream party ( the bnp and edl having since collapsed ) , it is going to attract racists . 
  and ukip have n't done a good enough job of vetting their candidates historically . 
  this is a major mistake on ukip 's part and i ca n't defend that . 
  nevertheless , the press * has * disproportionately focused on ukip 's ne'er - do-well candidates and not any of the main three parties ' , of which there are plenty and worse . 
  anyway , because ukip talks about immigration people assume it 's a racist party and people brand it as fascist without really paying attention , because they perceive it as the next in a long line of racist groups campaigning against immigration . 
  two things are different : firstly , it does n't want to discriminate on the grounds of race , it merely does n't think that immigration from several countries much poorer than britain should be totally outside the control of the government . 
  it favours more immigration from the commonwealth , which happens to be largely non-white , which is restricted because we are in the eu . 
  but nevertheless anti-fascist groups and the press ( who have an interest in staying in favour with the established parties , who would have thought ? ), 
  are happy to portray ukip in a terrible light . 
  this only serves to further polarize views since nobody reads a newspaper and changes their mind , they merely use the media to reinforce the views they already hold . 
  it makes the anti-ukip crowd more anti-ukip and the pro-ukip crowd more pro-ukip . 
  as someone who sits on the fence with ukip , it 's fascinating to watch . 
  anyway , what i 'm trying to say is , ukip is portrayed as racist because that 's the only way the left knows how to deal with it . 
  the thing about ukip is that nobody knows how to stop them - it 's probably just going to burn itself out once the economy recovers . 
  on top of perceived racism , they also have a bunch of old libertarian policies from their 2010 manifesto , which as one of many very small parties in 2010 was n't really a serious document but they keep having it thrown at them with quotes about the ridiculous policies they have . 
  while i do recognize that ukip should have probably put more thought into it , people do n't seem to realize that ( i ) they have no way of actually implementing them ever so it 's not relevant what policies they have , and ( ii ) people vote for outlook and philosophy not concrete policy , which is notoriously easy to change in politics . 
  tl ; dr ukip is the most recent in a succession of british parties and groups which campaign against immigration and have historically been racist groups . 
  ukip is not a racist party , but it is treated as such because of this . 
  they also have a bunch of silly policies from their 2010 manifesto which they probably would n't have if they 'd anticipated their surge in support since then . 
  i 'm not an old conservative cave man , but the way ukip is spoken about on reddit is as destructive and hateful as users want to portray ukip to be . 
  source ? 
  what 's spain 's grade point average ? 
  not as a percentage of gdp ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/platypus  there is no universally agreed plural of `` platypus '' in the english language . 
  scientists generally use `` platypuses '' or simply `` platypus '' . 
  colloquially , the term `` platypi '' is also used for the plural , although this is technically incorrect and a form of pseudo-latin ; [ 6 ] the correct greek plural would be `` platypodes '' so i tend to go with platypuses , or platypodes ( see : octopodes ) , but not platypi . 
  also , relating to the op :  early british settlers called it by many names , such as ** `` watermole '' ** , ** `` duckbill '' ** , and `` duckmole '' . 
  `` khud ulmaa '' ( watermole ) in/around syria and utkonos / kachkodziob / others ( duck beak = duck bill ) in eastern europe . 
   i have a great deal of faith in the strength of the pro-european arguments but why did n't nick clegg say any of them ? 
  sounds like there 's a flaw somewhere else in the system , then , because he should n't be able to do that anyway . 
  i do sort of prefer the idea of not having a 20 year rule , though . 
  i get the sentiment , but i do n't understand why it follows that just because you have authority means you need to be held more accountable in front of the law ? 
  that sounds quite messy , there should either be a 20 year rule or not , surely ? 
  well the country did n't say it . 
  is it ever the song they vote for ? 
  i think that 's what he means . 
  sure , but when it 's not required / worth having / wanted , i do n't see the need to just post `` no '' on a discussion board , but maybe it 's just me . 
  i mean , i get the need to voice one 's opinion , but i do n't think just voicing the conclusion you 've reached is really helpful or interesting . 
  but do you not find that a kind of closed minded attitude ? 
  i do n't think i would vote ukip because i 'm not a libertarian , and i think the party still has some detoxifying to do before i can feel comfortable doing so , but when i listened to what they have to say i think they might have a point about the eu . 
  and it 's the eu argument that defines ukip * really * , although it 's a bit too immigration-focused for me . 
  but yeah , i used to think that ukip was full of fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists , and while it 's undoubted there is an element of that in the party , i do n't think it 's constituted of idiots , and it 's dismissive and closed-minded to think so . 
  of course , if you 're very anti-ukip , and you have a rational argument for being so , that 's great . 
  but just `` no , they 're idiots '' is * so * 2010 . 
  the debate has moved on since then . 
  would you say the conservatives are weakly pro ? 
  i would have said weakly anti . 
  it 's worth being fond of . 
  pretty high standards of debate here . 
  and of those who are interested , how many are only interested in them because they serve as a proxy for national politics , rather than knowing or caring about the role of the european parliament and the eu as a whole ? 
  they all look like something out of the 70s or something !, 
  yes , but a tv debate is made for a wider audience , who are n't necessarily going to be used to listening to people talk about complicated subjects through a live translation by someone who is n't necessarily very good ( this euronews debate did n't seem to have a very high production value ) . 
  whenever i watch european parliament debates , i feel like proper flow of the debate is spoiled by the reality of a live translation environment . 
  it 's fine when they 're in the parliament , because everyone listening is , realistically , going to be used to it . 
  rarely if ever do i watch things which are live translated , it will either be dubbed or subtitled ( or , realistically , just made in english ) . 
  someone mentioned somewhere else that europeans are used to watching things in multiple languages , but i do n't think things that tend to be live translated . 
  when aiming at a wide audience , different rules apply , i did n't think that live translation would help the debate . 
  however , i see now that making them all do it in english does give otherwise competent participants a disadvantage which is far more detrimental to the debate than problems with the flow due to live translation . 
  i thought it would be better for the flow of the debate for everybody to speak the same language , but now i think i was wrong and they should be able to use their own . 
  the flow was pretty stale as it was anyway . 
  i only know one person who accepts payment in angular momentum , and that 's my husband . 
  who complains about that ? 
  that 's right , right-centrist \\ subset right wing . 
  yeah , it 's popular to disapprove of pmqs . 
  well in fairness that is when it 's most noticeable . 
  they 're all the same ? 
  this 'll be really good if the banks should ever fail !, 
   if england actually took the scottish nationalists seriously they would do just that , but they cant even be asked with the current outlook . 
  erm , i do n't think that those of us in england would take kindly to that either . 
  plenty of us have family and friends in scotland . 
  i 'd be against unreasonable and unneighbourly measures for political reasons - just because we did n't want them to be independent . 
  and i think most people i know would be too . 
  personally i was shocked when it turned out rebellious_boa was spying on everyone . 
  they were calling obama an ass . 
  have you prepared for the overwhelming victory of the vladimir putin party in this may 's elections ? 
   that 's not true though . 
  the netherlands is more urbanized than the uk , and belgium even more urbanized than the netherlands . 
  oh , that 's not what i was saying . 
  the uk 's population is concentrated in points , cities . 
  the netherlands ' is less concentrated in single spots * because * it 's more urbanized . 
  because our population is more concentrated in cities , whereas nl and belgium are relatively small to start with . 
  that was me with your mother . 
  clearly you 've never tried our indian or chinese food .
