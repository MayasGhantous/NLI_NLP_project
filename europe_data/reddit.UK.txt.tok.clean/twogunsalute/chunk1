indian, 
  do n't know any blind people , wheelchair users , gypsies ( irish travellers or roma ) , transgender people where did you go to uni ? 
  i am so triggered right now, 
  do n't get upset, 
  eastern europeans stand out . 
  the men do n't really bother with their appearance . 
  they dress for comfort not style so tend to wear tshirts , joggers/tracksuit bottoms , ill fitting jeans and the clothes are low quality . 
  they have short hair ( often buzzed short ) and do n't tend to be in good shape . 
  the women wear quite a bit of makeup and pluck their eyebrows thin and again they tend to wear cheap clothes . 
  men and women smoke ( a lot of ) cigarettes whereas locals smoke rollies or vape . 
  living in the suburbs , food shopping in waitrose/m & s , driving a merc/bmw/audi , favourite shops are john lewis , cath kidston , joules , whistles , boden and jack wills for the teens , skiing holidays, 
  16 ( not including my home country of course ) . 
  only 5 were in europe , or 6 if you include turkey in europe . 
  within europe i liked france the most and italy the least . 
  could n't pick a singular favourite for a non-european country i visited but least liked was definitely egypt . 
  you can find it in most big supermarkets but it 's not massively popular . 
  i actually have a bottle and i do n't get the big deal , it 's ok but nothing special, 
  mass effect trilogy honourable mention to fallout new vegas, 
  breakfast - oats with soy/almond milk , fruit 2nd breakfast - eggs maybe with toast lunch - meat with veg dinner - meat with veg snacks - nuts , peanut butter sandwich , shakes , fruit, 
  what kind of microwave meals do italians eat ? 
  is `` peng '' like `` bang '' in german ? 
  in the uk `` peng '' is slang for good . 
   but it is in my area . 
  north east ? 
  you do n't have house parties in germany ? 
  most frequently shop at aldi and then lidl occasionally pop into iceland to pick up meat or frozen vegetables and rarely ( like once every few months ) go sains/tesco for items i ca n't get at any of the above, 
  how different is mexican and us coke ? 
  and how do they both compare to coke in europe ? 
  yes , back in 2014, 
  not popular , many people probably do n't even know they exist . 
  only seem to be found in health food shops ( eg holland & barrett ) and chinese/asian supermarkets . 
  personally i 've only ever had it once ( one of the japanese drinks ) and it was not unpleasant, 
  some republicans are just big on the whole head-chopping of monarchs thing . 
  all the other stuff is kinda secondary, 
  the only people i 've heard praising cromwell are republicans, 
  if money was no object then brighton or i 'd try london for a year or so . 
  otherwise belfast seems like an interesting place or bournemouth because i 've heard nice things about it . 
  either the north east of england eg middlesbrough , sunderland , hartlepool etc or scotland because it 's too far away and the money would annoy me, 
  do n't really get it in the uk . 
  i remember trying some when i was little and seeming to like it but have never had it since, 
  personally i like mayo , ketchup and chilli sauces garyjm covered pretty much all the condiments from the uk but there 's also salad cream and branston pickle ( goes great with cheese sandwiches ), 
  45g of oats , 10g of dried fruit , drizzle of maple syrup , 100ml of soy milk and a banana, 
  private outdoor pool in the uk ? 
  lol no between the crap weather and tiny gardens only the very wealthy might have them . 
  everyone else just goes to local council swimming pools . 
  what was his recent statement ? 
  various irish people ( eg graham norton ) and lots from outside of europe ( eg anish kapoor , kevin pietersen , mo farah etc ) . 
  for just europe , raymond blanc ( franc ) , bruno toniolo ( italy ) , gino d'acampo ( italy ) , stelios from easyjet ( greece/cyprus ) , and lots of sportspeople/footballers, 
  even you did n't name a city from your own country !, 
  paris , venice and not sure of a 3rd ( i need to visit more places ), 
  visit stoke, 
  no , we have tea but we do n't have sun, 
  dumb question but how do you even cut that ? 
  do you have to knock it on it 's side and slice it or do you just pick out individual balls ? 
  i thought song of the sea was beautiful, 
  maybe i 'm just a cultural philistine but i do n't get why people went so nuts over the kings speech . 
  it was ok but i was n't blown away by it . 
  sort of . 
  i can easily tell eastern europeans apart from brits based on their clothes/hair . 
  american tourists can stand out too . 
  what 's a bundesliga haircut ? 
   i mean i count maybe five cities in the world that contain anywhere close to that much beauty . 
  which 5 ? 
  probably because europeans think the british are basically americans ? 
  i do n't * think * we have them in the uk - if we have i 've never noticed !, 
  - but if we did i imagine we 'll have one when the queen dies . 
  90s or 60s maybe ? 
  i meant the 90s were uneventful for the uk, 
  ditto for britain i guess the 90s were kinda uneventful,

  never heard of it and and had to google her . 
  i do n't think pippi longstocking is popular in the uk . 
  lots of people like to think their shit does n't stink . 
  people in / r/askeurope think europe is the pinnacle of human civilisation and people in / r/askanamerican think it 's america . 
  i really like / r/askanamerican ( and america/americans generally ) but they can be just as delusional as any other . 
  not seen anyone wear them for years now though . 
  maybe you guys should swap lives parent trap-style, 
  get to da choppa !, 
  georgia - that war with russia armenia - genocide ( and something like they were one of the earliest civilizations to adopt christianity ) azerbaijan - conflict with armenia basically not a lot, 
  i ca n't think of any films/tv shows about the norman conquest, 
  have you read/watched the pillars of the earth ? 
  that was easy, 
  a very popular tourist destination for brits , particularly younger brits ( 20s-30s ) personally i 'm not a big gambler so it 's not at the top of my travel to-do list but it would still be interesting to have a look . 
  ( also fallout and csi ), 
   luvsit . 
  so it looks you get every show we get apart from our news, 
  yeah bbc4 and more4 have shown a few foreign language shows in the past eg borgen , spiral , the killing , deutschland 83 etc. 
  and now more 4 are showing quite a few foreign language shows as part of walter presents eg spin , black widow , the swingers etc, 
  oh wow i ca n't believe shite like embarassing bodies gets aired abroad !, 
  a prolapse in every episode, 
  good friday , easter monday , christmas day and boxing day . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  new years day is a bank holiday but i 've never considered it to be a religious holiday though . 
  hardly ever see them walking around . 
  occasionally see police cars driving around . 
  i live in a city of ~ 350,000 but do n't get into the city centre much, 
  yeah of course . 
  and most people will use them . 
  even after 2am in city centre branches they are absolutely heaving and everyone just drunkenly crowds around the touchscreens to order . 
  you only go up front to order if you have cash .
