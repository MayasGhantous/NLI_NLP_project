  and there are various smaller redevelopment plans in cities across the country eg cardiff , dundee , coventry they might not all be `` mega '' projects but they 're big for the uk and automatically cost billions because everything is too damn expensive here, 
  176cm or 5 ' 9 '' and that is supposed to be the average height for men in the uk . 
  people insist on telling me that i 'm taller than 176cm though for some reason so maybe i look taller . 
  wish i actually was taller though , 6ft would be nice . 
  every day of course varies whether i shower in the morning or at night . 
  sometimes i go twice a day if i shower in the morning but then go gym later on . 
  surprised that there are people replying here who * do n't * bathe daily . 
  edit : lol at getting downvoted by the dirty smelly buggers here, 
  why is it declining ? 
  and why does kazan seem to be growing ? 
  how is hollandais pronounced ? 
  like the sauce ? 
  they 're not going to have a ramadan section if it 's not going to sell . 
  i 've regularly seen seasonal sections for ramadan / eid / chinese new year / diwali / hanukkah etc in supermarkets in cities across the country, 
  in my local big tesco , the world food section has indian/south asian , chinese/east asian eg japanese , korean etc , caribbean , polish/eastern european , american , jewish/kosher . 
   i think you are overestimating , or over-exaggerating , how many french-algerians you met . 
  i was in paris just last year , and i met very few french-algerians , compared to french-french . 
  depends on which part of paris op was in though i guess . 
  australia 2 . 
  maybe somewhere in s/se asia like singapore or india, 
  can i ask why so many are so supportive of trudeau ? 
  what has he actually done so far ? 
  seems to have managed ireland well through its economic problems . 
  how many immigrants do you have and where are they from ? 
  aw i like the french, 
  i think the uk is a great place to live ( sure there are problems but lots of places have problems ) and i live in cardiff which is a great little city, 
  `` just '' south like wigston or like lutterworth ? 
   it 's more of a mindset that takes hold of people . 
  like people are insular ? 
  or living in the past , unwilling to adapt to now ? 
  france . 
  charlemagne , richelieu , cathars , huguenots , napoleon , algeria , it 's an incredible history . 
  russia and turkey are also fascinating . 
  we could kill a part of ourselves . 
  like norwich . 
  fuck france - les cousins dangereux marry netherlands - kinda already did it with the glorious revolution kill iceland - because they ca n't decide if they are a real country or a supermarket, 
  how is milton keynes orwellian ? 
  i thought le havre was supposed to have lots of interesting architecture * because * it was rebuilt after the war . 
  it 's a unesco world heritage site . 
  did cumbernauld look good when it was first built though ? 
  i was under the impression it was hated from the get-go, 
  apart from the ancient greeks , who are the more modern day greeks you would list ? 
  where is the north/south divide in italy ? 
  do you not wear joggers/trackies/shorts ? 
  which war ? 
  why are n't they delivered straight to your address ? 
  why do you need to pick them up from a post office ? 
  union jack is a great flag , one of the best in the world imo . 
  england 's flag is boring . 
  i 'd be ok with it changing but to what ? 
  i do n't think there are any other contenders, 
  she 's ok . not great but i do n't think she 's evil incarnate as some on reddit think . 
  why will he be worse ? 
  not at all really . 
  print media is woeful . 
  every knows the tabloids are terrible but once respected publications like the guardian and the telegraph have really declined in standards over the past decade . 
  some sections of the broadcast media are n't too bad eg pm on radio 4 but by and large i 'm very mistrusting of all news now . 
  i 'm pretty much in love with him .

  big bananaman fan ? 
  all british my previous job when i used to work in a restaurant we had irish , spanish , portuguese , korean , south african , russian, 
  american psycho by bret easton ellis midnight 's children and the satanic verses by salman rushdie interpreter of maladies by jhumpa lahiri the curious incident of the dog in the night time by mark haddon breakfast at tiffany 's by truman capote what are your favourites op ? 
  have you been watching the tv show ? 
   japs dat axis nah but seriously where would the vietnamese and japanese come on ops list there ? 
  lol ikr ? 
  not that many turks in the uk ( compared to other immigrant groups ) and they are concentrated in london so there is n't really a widespread perception of them beyond kebab shops . 
  does germany not have many asian migrants ? 
  chinese , indian , korean etc ? 
  i used to volunteer in a community centre where asylum seekers/refugees would come to socialise , get help etc. 
  i helped teach english in a conversation club . 
  they were all men ( never saw any female refugees there but maybe they went on different days/times ) and were from the middle east/africa . 
  many of them told stories of travelling across europe via greece , italy , france to come to the uk which i found interesting . 
  i tried to ask why they wanted to come to britain but never really got an answer and i did n't want to press them . 
  i often hear the argument that they come to britain because they speak english but that was n't the case here . 
  i even met a few french speakers from africa so why they did n't want to go to france idk . 
  they ca n't do anything while their asylum application is pending so it 's a pretty miserable existence with little to do and with no money and poor accommodation . 
  i think we ( society/government ) should do more for asylum seekers/refugees . 
  fifa because i like kitkat and i 'm english so fuck football generally, 
  yeah i would have said fa cup final . 
  maybe grand national after that because everyone puts a bet on . 
  not very . 
  [ according to wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_jews ) the uk has one of the biggest jewish populations in europe with over a quarter of a million . 
  but most jews live in london and the south east . 
  they used to live more spread across the country ( most cities will have synagogues ) but not so much now so unless you live in the south east/manchester/birmingham / leeds you 're not going to meet many jews . 
  ah yeh love me some cheesy chips, 
  [ idk why but i would have gone with this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upkb9z4l7em ), 
   it does n't even live here .
