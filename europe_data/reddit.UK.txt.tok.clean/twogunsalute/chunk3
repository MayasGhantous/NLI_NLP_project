  i 've tried evening classes for french and german before . 
  i do n't really like german but figured i should try it after doing german in school but it was impossible for me . 
  did n't make much headway in french but at least i can get the gist of things when reading it . 
  it seems pretty pointless to me . 
  everyone knows it 's soy milk , everyone calls it soy milk , even my store receipt will say soy milk , but the wording on the package is different . 
  we also have `` greek style salad cheese '' which i find quite funny . 
  yeah i have n't really thought about it but i 'm pretty sure the actual packaging will often say something like `` soy drink '' or `` alternative to milk '', 
  do n't you get soy milk in germany ? 
  it 's a substitute for dairy milk made from soybeans https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soy_milk, 
  a smoothie, 
  is pate for breakfast common in your country ? 
  oats with dried fruit , honey and soy milk, 
  coffee in the morning , tea for the rest of the day, 
  not much . 
  yay for being lactose sensitive, 
  side question : does anyone know how long the state of emergency is going to last for ? 
  i think the european subreddits have abandoned schulz and gone back to liking merkel again now, 
  it 's not * every * national election , it 's only recently because brexit set the cat amongst the pigeons so people are skittish . 
  after merkel wins later this year people will have calmed down by then . 
  i do n't know if you can allow salman rushdie because he 's british/indian but if so midnights children and satanic verses . 
  otherwise the curious incident of the dog in the night time by mark haddon ( and honorary mention to white teeth by zadie smith ), 
  what else are you going to call something you eat if you do n't call it `` food '' ? 
  is chocolate food for you or something else ? 
  junk food is usually defined as processed food with a low nutritional content . 
  aw poor orkneys and shetlands being abandoned like that !, 
  so many . 
  korea , mexico , south africa , sri lanka , morocco , fiji ... 
  which 7 ? 
  why hong kong of all places ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  pretty much used to it tbh, 
  is catalan very different from spanish ? 
  or is it mutually intelligible and quite easy to learn the other language ? 
  more middle aged than old old, 
  the wedding planner, 
  my favourite shops from the uk are asos ( the 1 year next day delivery for # 10 does not help my bank balance ) , river island , topman . 
  ( non uk but european shops i like are h&m , primark and zara ) most popular depend on age range . 
  topman/topshop for younger people , next and m&s for older people, 
  never heard of it, 
  i like interesting tattoos , do n't like generic ones . 
  a lot of tattoos just look bad ( either bad design or poorly done ) imo . 
  tattoos are pretty common in the uk , seems like every other person under the age of 30 has one now . 
  definitely have to keep czech republic , hungary and spain if only for the porn, 
  the us does n't have contactless pay ? 
  i find that hard to believe, 
  in the uk - joe bloggs or john smith not heard of a female version though but i would assume it would be jane, 
  / r/comics ( big fan of channelate and mr lovenstein ) and grace and frankie on netflix, 
  tbf nearly all of those questions about america/americans come from this op in particular, 
  it must be really bad in denmark if you envy anything about the uk 's housing market, 
  i do n't know how it works in germany but in the uk you can not renew a book you have already borrowed if someone else has requested it . 
  papercuts by colin bateman, 
  kinda hoping for melenchon vs le pen second round just for the drama, 
  pretty much everyday . 
  do n't eat out or get takeaways/ready meals much because it 's too expensive . 
  and i need to watch my macros . 
  people talk about racism between english and scots . 
  yes of course . 
  turkey ( the asian side ) , egypt , israel , india , thailand , singapore , malaysia , cambodia , hong kong . 
  i 've been renewing the same library book for several months now . 
  does that count as reading ? 
  cloudberry does n't look as magical as i imagined it to be, 
  there 's only so much raclette one can have, 
  my teeth are naturally healthy so democracy + dental tourism, 
   humor you disgust me, 
  late 19th century . 
  technology was really transforming the world - electric lighting , telegraphy , railways etc the world was smaller than ever but with still clearly distinct cultures and customs and clothes . 
  ` pedal ' ? 
  from the mids but have lived in the north west and wales . 
  never had it myself ( do n't have lamb or hot cross buns either ) but i 've * heard * of it . 
  * cough * ^ / r/shittyfoodporn * cough *, 
  yeah women love them, 
  in the uk : [ hot cross buns ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_608/recipes/mary_berrys_hot_cross_65003_16x9.jpg ) - a sweet bun with currants and cinammon marked with a cross on top , traditionally eaten on good friday but people have it just whenever now [ roast lamb ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pa9y6fu.jpg ) - for lunch on easter sunday , or sometimes roast ham [ simnel cake ] ( https://loveincorporated.blob.core.windows.net/contentimages/main/simnelcakeedited.jpg ) - a fruit cake with marzipan or almond paste and apricot jam usually had at tea on easter sunday . 
  it 's topped with 11 or 12 balls of marzipan to represent the apostles . 
  and of course , [ chocolate eggs !,

  personally i 'm a big fan of mini eggs, 
  what social media do people use in poland and germany then ? 
  is it a generational divide ? 
  in the uk , under 30s use twitter , insta and snapchat and many do n't even have facebook at all whereas older people only use facebook . 
  what country do you live in ? 
  do people use instagram , snapchat in your country ? 
  not met many russians but the only common thread has been that the guys were very homophobic, 
  what are those negative stereotypes ? 
   what is your opinion of your military ? 
  ok i guess , i do n't think about it too much . 
  i do wish they would stop being sent all around the world , i 'm opposed to military intervention ( i kind of hate blair for this ) . 
  helping with humanitarian crises and natural disasters is fine . 
   do you know any soldiers ? 
  what made them join ? 
  it 's a good career path and provides opportunities they would n't get elsewhere  do you think the allocated budget is about right ? 
  i suppose meeting nato 's 2 % target is fair  if shit hit the fan and there is war on your country 's soil , do you trust your army would do its job ? 
  yes so what was so interesting about your conversation with the german marine ? 
  in wales as part of the welsh baccalaureate ( aka welsh bac ) there is a volunteering portion . 
  secondary school students have to do 10hrs of volunteering work and college students do 30hrs and then they do a report on it . 
  i have mixed feelings about it . 
  it takes time away from other studies and activities and the final report they need to do is stupidly long and is just before exams . 
  but i also think it 's good to get kids out of their comfort zone and it 's great for the community . 
  totally opposed . 
  people complain when they intervene and when they do n't intervene so better to go with option that does n't put american lives at risk and wastes their money . 
  ( i 'm similarly opposed to the uk intervening anywhere around the world . ),
