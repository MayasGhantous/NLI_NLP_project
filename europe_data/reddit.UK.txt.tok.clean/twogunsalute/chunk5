  what is coffee like in korean coffeehouses ? 
  is it similar to in other coffeeshops in america or is there anything that makes it specifically korean ? 
  how do you mean ? 
  that 's more of a shelbyville thing personally i think it 's weird and only hear of it from pakistani people . 
  i need to start weaning myself of / r/europe ( like i did with / r/unitedkingdom ) , it gets pretty tiresome, 
  what are korean coffeehouses like ? 
  and what are chinese bakeries like ? 
  lots of red bean paste ? 
  still not really a cafe * culture * , there are just lots of coffee shops around . 
  sure people go for coffee and get coffee to go but it 's not as ingrained in our culture as going to the pub or having tea at home . 
  it 's the same way how there are lots of gyms around but we would n't be described as having a gym culture . 
  instead of going for a coffee and get a table outside and talk you go for a pint and get a table inside and talk ( and maybe watch football on tv/play pool or darts/have a pub quiz ), 
  that 's more a `` caff '' culture than * caf\u00e9 * culture, 
  do n't have one . 
  we have a pub culture . 
  why do they teach history of medicine anyway ? 
  we did it too but i never really understood the importance of it . 
  seems like an odd topic instead of something like empire or ww1, 
  20th century northern ireland - gerrymandering , good friday agreement etc do n't remember learning much about the actual violence though like terrorist attacks or bloody sunday which is kind of weird now i think about it . 
  though maybe my memory is just hazy but also i never really paid much attention , i just pretended to do work in history class, 
  people do n't really * talk * a lot about a colour scheme but of course the decor will all match . 
  pub i most often go to is the albany - [ sunny !,

  ] ( https://www.sabrain.com/media/4059/albany_h.png ) ca n't find any interior photos though cafes i usually go to a chain like coffee # 1 - [ exterior ] ( http://www.coffee1.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_0210.jpg ) [ interior ] ( http://www.coffee1.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/albany-23.jpg ) but sometimes end up at made - [ exterior ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/30/3a/65/cardiff-made.jpg ) [ interior ] ( http://www.jomec.co.uk/altcardiff/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dsc_0435.jpg ), 
  which flags do you find threatening ? 
  is n't nandos south african ? 
  apparently portugal just broke into the top 5 most common foreign nationalities in the uk in 2015 with 219,000 , just behind romania : https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/bulletins/ukpopulationbycountryofbirthandnationality/august2016, 
  only ever met one portuguese immigrant . 
  he was nice enough but kept talking about how all the guys back home use prostitutes all the time . 
  it was a little weird how often he would mention it tbh . 
  generally speaking i do n't think the uk is a very popular destination for portuguese migrants . 
  pretty much anything from a boulangerie in france ( though there 's a lot of foods with foreign origins that i cook or eat here and love but they are nothing like the authentic food eg pasta i eat or make is nothing like pasta in italy . ), 
  worked during the cold war , it 's outdated now, 
  possibly . 
  but it 's hard to say . 
  the labour candidate had his own fair share of gaffes so maybe if ukip had someone competent they could have stolen it ( does n't look like ukip have anyone competent at all though ! ), 
  but then again if the tories actually campaigned they could have taken stoke too , they were only a few votes behind nuttall . 
  in england - the north and midlands . 
  these were big manufacturing areas where each city had a different speciality - eg sheffield steel , stoke ceramics , leicester textiles etc. 
  the bigger cities like manchester , liverpool , newcastle etc have had a lot of investment and managed to reinvent themselves with new industries , usually services like media , tourism , finance , it etc. 
  the smaller towns and cities eg stoke , sunderland , wolverhampton , hartlepool etc are really struggling , maybe even dying , with little to look forward to . 
  regarding politics , these areas are all solidly labour however there is a bit of a backlash in the poorer places . 
  this is part due to unpopularity of jeremy corbyn and also the fact that labour have been voted in for decades but little has changed for the better . 
  there was actually a by-election in one such area yesterday - copeland in cumbria has been labour for decades but voted tory for the first since the 1930s !, 
  but there was another by-election in a similar area in stoke but labour held that one so maybe you ca n't read too much from the copeland result . 
  * germany 's federal system and voting system * germany 's education system with distinct schools for vocational education and higher education * netherlands ' cycling infrastructure * spain/france/germany 's high speed rail * switzerland 's transport infrastructure * whatever the heck sweden is doing with it 's recycling, 
  wales . 
  gets overlooked by international tourists who mostly go london , scotland and the odd town in england like york or bath . 
  twinings beg to differ https://www.twinings.co.uk/tea/english-breakfast, 
  first things first , just tumble out of bed and stumble to the kitchen . 
  pour myself a cup of ambition . 
  and yawn and stretch and try to come to life ... 
  ya know , the usual . 
  is folgers the one with that incesty advert ? 
  not a politician any more though otherwise i would have said him or possibly tristam hunt . 
  female uk politicians : maybe [ gloria del piero ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/60/5c/81/605c810b8ec9104005fb4f85d5f99710.jpg ) , [ penny mordaunt ] ( http://static.wixstatic.com/media/3b8867_b9cd611c03984050b1f9720214f5d51b~mv2.jpg ) , [ priti patel ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03243/patel_1_3243528b.jpg ) no idea for male politicians, 
  it 's consistent for liquid ingredients but its a pain for converting dry ingredients - 1 cup of sugar is 200g , flour 120g , oats 90g etc, 
  i understand your cups system , i just think it 's kinda stupid, 
  we usually measure ingredients in metric in the uk . 
  so seeing recipes from abroad ( usually the us ) when they use cups to measure is really annoying because you have to google each individual ingredient to convert it to grams/ml, 
  roma - beggars gypsy - if irish travellers usually caravans , harassing people , leaving a mess , big fat gypsy weddings i do n't personally know any roma/gypsies so am going off what i 've observed or media representation, 
  personally i just downvote and avoid anything brexit/uk related there and upvote pretty much anything else , especially nice photos, 
  take your crazy to / r/ketchuphate , heathen, 
  cyprus ? 
  did you not know that she ( and other german leaders ) are called chancellor instead of president ? 
  everytime shes mentioned in the news she is referred to as `` chancellor angela merkel '', 
  all time favourite : [ camille - le festin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-3z3jmdil0 ) beautiful vocals honourable mention to [ joyce jonathan - \u00c7a ira ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txwlybpwbzs ) pretty girl singing french and it sounds really cute and upbeat, 
  before brexit it was equally shite except it was all toriestoriestories instead of brexitbrexitbrexit . 
  i gave up on that sub after the 2015 election and my reddit experience is a lot nicer now . 
  i tried to get more activity on there but noone gave a crap . 
  and the mods are just sitting on it , possibly because they want it to be dead so people will use / r/uk which they are also mods for, 
  no contest , red sauce til i die !, 
  2hrs per week ? 
  apart from songs of praise what else is there ? 
  had no idea it was happening and could n't have told you who your president was before . 
  your president holds no power , it 's just not important . 
  does n't seem like much of an election though if there 's no real contest . 
  there 's an amazing malaysian place called jalan malaysia not been myself but heard great things about the clink where the restaurant is in the grounds of the prison and all the staff are prisoners as part of a rehab/retraining scheme, 
  no , not really . 
  republicans are quite a small minority ( over-represented on reddit though ) the queen is pretty popular as are will and kate , not so much charles . 
  i bought it because i wanted something kinda small and economical . 
  had it for a long time now and want to get something else . 
  first thought is scammers then after that its general nigeria facts - west africa , biggest population in africa , oil rich , corrupt , boko haram , muslim north/christian south , nollywood , jollof rice, 
  i was n't proud of them , i thought `` good for them '' . 
  ( if anything being proud of them seems a little bit patronising ) interested to see what you think about my other comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5sh90k/are_there_any_aspects_of_american_culture_that/ddfrd6n/ ), 
  out of interest how can you be proud of other countries that have nothing to do with you ? 
  so do you have no pride in your hometown or your family ? 
  you did n't choose any of those . 
  you have a euro flag flair , are you telling you have no pride in europe or being european ? 
  when you have pride in something it means something to you and you take care of it . 
  i 'm a firm believer in `` ask not what your country can do for you , ask what you can do for your country '' and you can not have that if you dislike or resent or are indifferent about your environment . 
  and i think that feeds back into how immigrants feel about the place . 
  if locals do n't care about being german etc , why would immigrants ? 
  and that can lead to integration issues . 
  having pride in your country . 
  and immigrants having pride in being american . 
  see how many posts from / r/pics from new citizens end up on the front page . 
  would never see anything like that from my country . 
  culture of entrepreneurship mexican food i 've heard littering is n't a big problem in the us ( and not culture but with canada , mexico and two oceans you have great neighbours so pretty envious of that ), 
  or a bomb that nearly takes out the entire administration during a national convention ...
