  keep me safe from what ? 
  nah you 're alright thanks, 
  [ aww you guys ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/010/809/happy-oh-stop-it-you.png ), 
  where did you move from ? 
  france . 
  it 's like britain but with sexy accents . 
  nah but seriously i just love france - the culture , history , food , landscapes , sexy accents ... 
  if i was n't british i 'd want to have been born in france, 
  as you said , apart from london pretty much all of these are out of date . 
  i wonder what the more modern answers are . 
  i suppose : leeds/edinburgh - finance manchester - media cambridge/oxford - science but for many cities now the public sector is usually the biggest employer . 
  i suppose there are a number of reasons . 
  the culture has always been to have a house , perhaps with outdoor space , and it 's hard to break that . 
  tall buildings can dominate and stick out like a sore thumb eg montparnasse tower so people do n't like them in town centres where they will overshadow older architecture 3 . 
  some countries built tower blocks in the past but they were of such poor quality that people are still put off by the concept now 4 . 
  many new apartments are very small compared to houses but still at a high price, 
  depends what you guys are into but if you want good nights out paris , berlin , barcelona , amsterdam , prague , budapest, 
  in europe netherlands , france , germany this year and italy next year . 
  globally , pakistan next year will be interesting . 
  in europe - amsterdam , it 's the only place i 've visited in europe that i could see myself living in . 
  though i also really liked nice too . 
  outside of europe - singapore or tel aviv, 
  having worked in a call centre calls from scotland were the worst , some of the accents are so thick it 's near indecipherable, 
  yes , porn would be far worse without america, 
  they 're all so same-y !, 
  i gave up half way through , there 's only so many globe graphics you can sit through but nrk dagsrevyen ( norway ) was the best because it was different, 
  not ancient but the oldest most famous pieces of literature are beowulf , [ history chronicles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecclesiastical_history_of_the_english_people ) by the [ venerable bede ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bede ) that start from the roman invasion of britain ( written in 8th century ) and [ history of the kings of britain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historia_regum_britanniae ) by [ geoffrey of monmouth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geoffrey_of_monmouth ) which includes some of the first mentions of king lear and king arthur ( written in 12th century ), 
  portugal - no idea why but i 've felt the need to visit it for a few years now 2 . 
  sweden - i want to see if swedes are really as beautiful as people say 3 . 
  malta - interesting mix of cultures and history ( i find the history of the crusades and knights really fascinating ) and it seems like it gets quite overlooked as a destination, 
  tbh i downvote anything about the uk in / r/europe . 
  also been downvoting all of those annoying map posts but luckily that bandwagon has stopped now . 
  north : edinburgh south : singapore east : hong kong west : cardiff highest : cameron highlands lowest : amsterdam, 
  no of course not . 
  if people get offended about stupid little things like that they need to get a grip . 
  do n't really have one . 
  i guess i think of much of the region as unstable ( either in terms of economy or security ) with a few countries like chile and uruguay doing very well . 
  do n't really know anything about culture apart from superficial things like football , catholicism , telenovelas etc the entire region just is n't a priority for me to visit but i would consider visiting mexico , brazil , peru , chile , argentina . 
  no interest at all in visiting central america . 
  turin is kinda overlooked as far as italian cities go, 
  try posting in / r/askuk if you want actual british people to respond instead of other europeans * assuming * how british people would respond, 
  dude probably is n't even asian, 
  people from yorkshire think they are hot shit for some reason also scotland but not really as it is it 's own country, 
  in the uk : ferrari , lamborghini , fiat , alfa romeo , lambretta , vespa gucci , d&g , prada , valentino , versace , armani , moschino , zegna , bulgari , cavalli , diesel nutella , lavazza , peroni , bertolli , cirio , san pellegrino , birra moretti not that many for a country of italy 's size really . 
  and most people will only have vaguely heard of some of these brands , let alone known they were italian . 
  they 're talking about straight porn where a guy asks random women to strip for money ( the straight version of czechhunter ), 
  they do n't eat for a whole week ?!, 
  nothing that i can think of in music/radio like that in the uk, 
  never heard those stereotypes at all . 
  i 'm guessing you 're from eastern europe ? 
  there are two in my gym, 
  not as much coverage as syria but stories crop up every so often . 
  latest story is the houthi rebels acting pm accusing the uk of war crimes in an interview with sky news . 
  and there have been charity appeals on tv from the dec for yemen . 
  how is yemen being reported in bulgaria ? 
  and syria ? 
  i did n't know gary johnson was dutch !, 
  in the uk , aleppo has been the top story on broadcast news for the past few days now and a lot of attention is on it . 
  really curious if it 's similar in other countries . 
  edit : and there seems to be a clamour for people to do something but not much agreement on what that something is so i imagine nothing will really change . 
  we have a similar thing in the uk at bonfire night . 
  people complain about fireworks like clockwork every year - `` they 're too loud '' , `` they scare my pets '' , `` they should only be allowed in public displays '' , `` they should be banned completely '' . 
  luckily it 's only a small but vocal minority , most ordinary people like fireworks . 
  the unrelenting negativity from people . 
  whats the new years eve discussion about ? 
  how do you compare to spanish and italians ? 
  you forgot marks and spencers !, 
  yeah i had some with nutella in a sandwich a few hours ago . 
  but it was an organic peanut butter that 's low in salt and sugar and high in protein so not like the typical peanut butter which can be greasy and very high in sugar and salt . 
  is your uncle antipodean or he just likes pavlova ? 
  any special cookies that are only made for christmas or are they just regular ones ? 
  i think you meant to post in / r/europemeta not / r/askeurope, 
  oh yeah defo stollen and you 've nailed it as being the aldi/lidl effect but i imagine german christmas markets everywhere have helped too . 
  but again i 've not had stollen either . 
  the ma\u0111arica look good - is it just chocolate and wafer ? 
  and are orehnja\u010da / makovnja\u010da cinnamon and nuts , chocolate or something ? 
  in the uk [ christmas pudding ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_pudding ) is the big one . 
  [ it 's a ** very ** heavy boiled pudding with treacle , dried fruit , spices and alcohol ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ps0jokv.jpg ) . 
  there are old traditions like stir up sunday where everyone in the house takes a turn to stir the spoon and make a wish and another tradition is to put a silver coin in the dough and whoever finds it will get good luck for the year . 
  and just before serving it 's covered in brandy and set on [ fire ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qpqqejy.jpg ) ( idk why ! ), 
  there 's also [ christmas cake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christmas_cake ) which is just a [ fruitcake ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7q4o4tw.jpg ) covered with marzipan and icing and [ mince pies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mince_pie ) which are [ crumbly pastry cakes with dried fruit and spices and dusted with icing sugar ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qzbehsg.jpg ) but mince pies are more of a snack than a proper dessert . 
  i personally prefer christmas cake to pudding ( i just love icing ) and mince pies are ok but can be hit and miss ( it depends on the quality of the pastry ) bonus answer : not sure how or why but panettone became popular over past 10 years and you can see them in lots of shops now . 
  never had it myself . 
  how do they say it and how are you * supposed * to say it ? 
  i just learnt yesterday that swansea in wales has a beaujolais day and it 's one of the busiest nights for bars/pubs/clubs in the whole year . 
  bonus question : are there any newer or foreign christmas desserts that have become more popular over recent years ? 
  and pictures please !, 
  and what is the political debate and public sentiment about it like ? 
  btw i do n't mean about refugees but more specifically about the siege/battle of eastern aleppo, 
  so your hometown and country as a whole are there lots of beggars or people sleeping rough ? 
  do people sleep in cars in your country ? 
  and how do you find it compares to other european countries ? 
  and how does it compare to other countries you are familiar with ? 
  and what would people from your country * usually * do in the same situation ? 
  ** extra info : ** this is a junction you know well and drive down frequently during day and night . 
  you can clearly see there are no cars anywhere around . 
  you know there are no cameras or anyone watching . 
  interested to see how strictly different countries/cultures might adhere to traffic rules, 
  and do you think the licence fee system is sustainable for the future ? 
  or manor , mansion , stately home , fortress etc if you want to include bonus non-european answers , go for it and include pics !,
