  i bet you thought it was going to be bad judging by the video .

  thank you , tyrroi is just a made up name  i try to submit less celtic stuff now because it would make up the majority of the posts here .

  great patron of celtic music . 
  loved this . 
  i guess so yeah . 
  the ** mabinogion ** - [ `` a collection of eleven prose stories collated from medieval welsh manuscripts . 
  the tales draw on pre-christian celtic mythology , international folktale motifs , and early medieval historical traditions . 
  while some details may hark back to older iron age traditions , each of these tales is the product of a highly developed medieval welsh narrative tradition , both oral and written .

  the fuck, 
  prince llywelyn of gwynedd 's favourite dog was gelert , a fearless hunting dog and loyal friend and companion who was said to have been a gift from king john of england . 
  llywelyn leaves his baby son with a nurse and a servant while he embarks on a hunting trip with his wife . 
  the nurse and the servant go for a walk in the mountains leaving the baby alone and unprotected . 
  after a while llywelyn notices that gelert is n't with the hunting pack . 
  reasoning that the only place gelert would go is back to the lodge , he calls off the hunt and heads back home . 
  as the party is dismounting , gelert comes running out of the lodge towards his master , covered in blood and wagging his tail . 
  the princess , calling her child 's name , faints . 
  llewelyn rushes in to find the cradle overturned , the bloodstained bedclothes thrown all over the floor , and no sign of his son . 
  [ filled with anger and grief he draws his sword against the dog . 
  as gelert dies , he whimpers and his cries are answered by the sound of a baby crying from behind the overturned cradle . 
  llewelyn pulls aside the cradle to find his son unharmed and the bloody body of a huge wolf next to him . 
  gelert had killed the wolf as it tried to attack llewelyn 's son . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/shaw13.jpg ) from that day onwards llewelyn never speaks again . 
  filled with remorse , he buries gelert in a meadow nearby and marks the grave with a cairn of stones , though he could still hear its dying cries . 
  the village of beddgelert ( gelert 's grave ) in north west wales is thought to owe its name to the legend . 
  i feel enriched . 
  they were n't killing each other in the name of their religion .

  when was the last time a christian beheaded someone in the street ? 
  yes exactly , it 's proved day in day out that their culture is not compatible with ours . 
  what 's your point exactly ? 
  i 'm saying that culturally europe is christian , turkey is not . 
  even country 's like britain where most people are n't religious , they still have christian values . 
  europe is christendom . 
  its sad they have to disguise themselves in case of left wing reprisals . 
  great constructive criticism there flacki , cheers . 
  if most people here dislike it you know it 's probably pretty good lol, 
  why do n't you just downvote them and move on ? 
  if you havnt already got it enabled , go to preferences  link options  do n't show links after i 've liked them ( except my own ) - do n't show links after i 've disliked them, 
  sadly not , i 'm in the south east . 
  do n't call us english , i think that goes for every celtic country . 
  why would you sit next to someone if there are free seats elsewhere ? 
  you get more room and a window seat . 
  it 's like that everywhere . 
  probably all we 've got left after budget cuts lol, 
  me too lol, 
  that fact is racist thats why . 
  didnt you steal it from genoa because you would pretend to be genoan so that you could get safe passage through the med ? 
  if we move it up a bit more we can get scotland in the arctic circle , if they 're frozen they ca n't vote to leave . 
  am i going crazy ? 
  why doesnt anyone get it ? 
  a big one is , what would happen to the uk ? 
  if scotland left , would n't it be the end of the uk ? 
  what happens to wales and northern ireland ? 
  do they get independence ? 
  i think its because no one really understands whats happening . 
  i have many questions about scottish independence . 
  what will happen to the uk if they get independence ? 
  will wales get independence ? 
  will northern ireland join the republic ? 
  europe -1 allahs - 0,

  [ from athos ] ( http://webm.host/5b098/vid.webm ) the greek air force buzzes the peaks sometimes , you can find videos of monks waving the flag as jets fly under them . 
  you must have been freezing mate . 
  when wood declares independance we will take back the hen ogledd . 
  they are n't going home lol, 
  she get 's 1 millions new voters , that 's why they 're welcome . 
  [ where 's your ira flair gone ? 
  could ** have ** parked a manure trailer near them lol, 
  same thing has been happening in britain . 
  he was n't attacking them , he was pushing the barrier , if he wanted to hurt them he could have smashed through that barrier no problem . 
   most welsh people are probably smart enough to realize leaving would not be in the best interest of wales . 
  that 's my point . 
   more welsh people voted for ukip last election than plaid that 's why i said in the north . 
  outside of wales , yes lol wales is ignored . 
  it 's a serious thing but its not likely at all . 
  we have our own party , plaid cymru which campaigns for it and they are very popular in the north of the country , but not in the south where most voters are . 
  i think most dream of independence but do n't see it as being achievable . 
  i heard they 're pretty much defacto independent anyway . 
  we 've supported catalan independence here in wales for a while now , and i know catalans have supported us , best of luck !, 
  let 's hope the basque get full independence too . 
  the bbc is ingrained with left wing thinking .
