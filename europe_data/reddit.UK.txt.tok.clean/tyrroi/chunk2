  yes it is , request asylum , wait for reply . 
  what do you mean , all they have to do is send a request to the country they want to go to . 
  they already have that . 
  not the first time this happened and it wont be the last . 
  stalin killed up to 60 million people , 900 over 3 years is a drop in the ocean . 
  i did n't say that though did i , you just made that quote for up . 
  i said you wouldnt have to kill many of them . 
  so 500 to 900 over 30 years , not bad . 
  no i did n't , this place has always been leftist and you just want to keep your victim complex . 
  they were introduced because the mods did n't like that the tide has been changing , the same reason they tagged every thread about immigration with `` controversial '' , this is / r/europe not a place for people who are eurosceptic , its inherently left wing . 
  they never were , this place has always been left wing . 
  lol keep telling yourself that , typical leftist victim complex . 
  you would n't end up killing many of them because they would n't even try . 
  legal or moral obligation ? 
  you do if they enter your territory without permission . 
  who 's saying that ? 
  the invisible right wing boogeyman ? 
  tough luck . 
  no one has to take them . 
  do n't know why you are being downvoted , it would help stop them getting past it . 
  as if a few volts going through you is worse than being shredded by razor wire . 
  why do n't they just put soldiers there , and anyone who tries to cross gets shot ? 
  this place is overwhelmingly left wing , the mods will outright ban you if you say anything too critical of immigrants . 
  also worth watching is this , [ `` the decline of the west | oswald spengler '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsaiezt5vjk ), 
   i 'm not sure which is worse , the ridiculous paranoia , or the racist xenophobia . 
  how is it any of those things ? 
  it 's a fictional work . 
  i wonder if the mods will add a pretty little flair to this post , in english and french !, 
  like yours . 
  no there is n't . 
  because immigrants do n't have pensions do they ... classic stupid argument , same as the old `` they 'll work jobs other people wont '', 
  it 's easier to dehumanise them and paint them as fascists , i think people are finally waking up to this leftist tactic though . 
   aaaaaaand the downvotes are comming , welcome to / r/europe [ 1 ] ... lol are you implying that this subreddit is in anyway hostile to immigrants ? 
  the only reason my people are still here are because of the nationalist revival in the 60s , and the countless revolts before that , we would have been just another part of england if it was n't for our nationalism . 
  the ottoman empire was off the gates of vienna at one point , turkey is not . 
  the only reason it would be considered europe is because they own istanbul , that does n't make them european though , spain has two cities in africa , no one calls them african . 
  what 's this got to do with europe ? 
  yes . 
  it 's not safe , if 10000 muslims come in , and only 1 commits an attack , that 's 1 too many . 
  yes , unfortunately the few ruin it for the many . 
  i would be a great terrorist honestly , aim for the doors . 
  i know , hopefully they will create the safe zone and they can all be sent there . 
  youre an immigrant defending more of them . 
  surprise surprise . 
  why do we have to deal with it ? 
  send them to turkey or something , at least they share a similar culture . 
  do you have no respect for your country , your land ? 
  your neighbors land ? 
  your country has provided you everything and you 're willing to let someone degrade and destroy it ? 
  you would just let someone shit in your garden ? 
  thats a different article , and it does n't have the video of them attacking the train . 
  i do n't care if they are unarmed , if someone breaks into your house and you have a gun you would shoot them . 
  i have no sympathy for them . 
  so sad , wylit . 
  everything in the mabinogion is worth reading , the stories of branwen ferch ll\u0177r , math fab mathonwy , breuddwyd macsen wledig , hanes taliesin . 
  king arthur is our 's too though most people think it 's english , ` culhwch and olwen ' talks about him and his knights chasing the giant boar twrch trwyth with his dog cavall . 
  read the mabinogi . 
  the only things i can say in dutch are swearwords lol i work at a holiday boat place here in wales , the most foreigners we get are from england and then holland , we have 11 boats and there are normally at least 3 rented to dutch people , is there a reason we get so many dutch ? 
  saxons out . 
  can we not just let them fight it out ? 
  i 'm 32 years old , you ca n't call someone fascist when they are n't . 
  the person i responded to called franco fascist , he is wrong so i 'm going to tell him he 's wrong so people do n't go believing his lies . 
  if it is n't fascist you shouldnt call it fascist ... 
  nazism is n't even fascism , get your facts right . 
  it was nationalist conservative , falangism is n't fascism . 
  no it was n't . 
  i give them 1 week . 
  god forbid someone else can express their opinion , you should be a mod here . 
  what is ; black bloc . 
  ** wales ** * nothing, 
  90 % of the time stuff goes down its because some anarchists start a fight , and get wrecked , [ just like here in your own country . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srnakisibyu&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m5s ), 
  ooo , quirky hyperbole , careful . 
  which green party candidate for wales will you choose ? 
  [ un ] ( http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41959000/jpg/_41959868_brig_203.jpg ) , [ dau ] ( https://i2.wp.com/jacothenorth.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/matt-cooke.png?resize=218%2c400 ) , [ tri ] ( http://www.harmonicslife.net/blog/2011/20110712/chrisbusby.jpg ) or [ pedwar ? 
  ] ( http://candidatehub.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/chris-bow-tie-green-background.jpg ), 
  the leftist mods . 
  / r/european careful , you might get triggered . 
  [ mean while at the gates of budapest ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj0cfoi4tym ) takbir !, 
  we are n't exactly european are we , thank god we are an island nation separated from them . 
  this sub has always been shit . 
  if ukraine accepted the right to self determination we could end this mess quickly . 
  where is this image from ? 
  how do i know those images are real ? 
   dic \u00b7 ta \u00b7 tor  a ruler with total power over a country , typically one who has obtained power by force . 
  putin gained power perfectly legally and the people continue to vote for him , get your head out of your arse . 
  that 's what i thought . 
  no one seriously accuses the russian elections of being rigged . 
  russian people love putin , even foreign polls show this . 
  what dictatorship is that ? 
  so you would rather indoctrinate them into atheism ? 
  parents choose to send there children to a school , if you do n't like it go to a different one . 
  edit : i 've been banned so i cant reply now . 
  it does n't sound like that school was properly administrated then , i went to a catholic school and it was no different to a non faith school except we went to church once a week . 
  what your describing sounds like a religious camp rather than a proper school checked over by government inspectors , but i would n't know , i assume it does n't exist anymore , and for good reason . 
  faith schools are only a problem when they 're muslim . 
  `` i was cold i was naked were you there were you there ? '', 
  people laughed at the muslamic ray guns guy too , until he was proven right . 
  they hold territory in syria , yemen and somalia . 
  there have been attacks , like the one on the military base , the times square car bomb , if you think it 's been wiped out you do n't know what youre on about .
