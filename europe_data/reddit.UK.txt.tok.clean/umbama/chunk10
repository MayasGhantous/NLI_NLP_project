  cypriot households are 35 % larger than german ones . 
  the ecb report also ignores state and occupational pensions savings . 
  it 's a bit of a rubbish report really . 
   * you 've got some mystery law prof on your side * it 's not ` my side ' . 
  he is n't a ` mystery ' - he 's professor john merryman , sweitzer professor of law and also professor of art at stanford university . 
  apart from that your remark 's 100 % correct . 
   * i wonder which side has more legal validity * than the eu ? 
  the law prof , i 'd suppose . 
   * return the stolen greek cultural treasure to greece * it 's not clear that they were stolen . 
  it 's not clear that 2,500 year-old sculptures belong in some sense to contemporary greece more than they ` belong ' to the world . 
  you 're shouting . 
  yes i know . 
  this addresses your point ... how ? 
  but look , anyway , you and i can both agree there 's significant legal opinion on * both * sides . 
  at the end of the day it is n't some assertion about international law that should detain us . 
  what 's the * right * thing to do ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i can see argument on both sides . 
  i 'm sure , though , i 'm not going to be swayed by someone who appears not to grasp the difficulty . 
   * i thought it had been established that the majority of legal experts * well ... you made the claim , did n't back it up , and did n't address the quote i posted from a stanford law prof. is that what you mean by ` established ' ? 
   * or the ever so insistent ones . 
  * well , no . 
  in a silly comment about people making silly mistakes you made ... a silly mistake . 
  indeed it does . 
   * it 's sort of a compromise that has to be reached between everyone * love that imperative . 
  why does this compromise ` have ' to be reached ? 
  one might have expected you 'd be able to spell ` atlas ' . 
  because your hypothetical was meant to be an analogy but it 's an extremely poor one . 
  athens had been part of the ottoman empire for 350 years and the marbles were sold legally by a bunch of people who damn near blew the bloody thing up . 
   * `` we are where we are '' is a very poor argument as well . 
  * absolutely not . 
  it is exactly the reason we 're talking about it . 
   * was literally sawed off the acropolis illegally and the stolen statuary hastily packed out of the country . 
  elgin had no legal right to take the statues * see , this is where we now have to bandy about legal arguments when neither of us are legal experts in this matter - and we have to do it because you started it , pretending you had a knock-down certain position . 
   * in contrast , professor john merryman , sweitzer professor of law and also professor of art at stanford university , putting aside the discrepancy presented by rudenstine , argues that since the ottomans had controlled athens since 1460 , their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognizable . 
  the ottoman sultan was grateful to the british for repelling napoleonic expansion , and the parthenon marbles had no sentimental value to him . 
  further , that written permission exists in the form of the firman , which is the most formal kind of permission available from that government , and that elgin had further permission to export the marbles , legalizes his ( and therefore the british museum 's ) claim to the marbles * and you can of course supply another expert to say the opposite . 
  so could you stop pretending you have evidence , have demonstrated beyond all doubt the legality of the case ? 
   * illegal in the eyes of most * * one direction * seems pretty popular ` in the eyes of most ' . 
  i offered it for consideration rather than for a knock-down argument . 
  and i 'd be wary of claiming it must be a poor argument because * look what would happen if we carried it through to an extreme conclusion * . 
  we are where we are : to disturb the current arrangements offer me an argument , do n't tell me what should happen to artifacts in vancouver i care nothing about . 
   * that 's why i said that modern and ancient greeks are 99.999999 % the same * but by your own argument the same relative similarity obtains for londoners too . 
   * london is the same as greece * well , no . 
  but neither are much like classical athens . 
   * the dna/genes are 99.999999 % * right . 
  so are mine . 
  do you do what you just did and call it ` thinking ' ? 
   * her idea on relocation of the irish was in her own words * during a late-night conversation at chequers . 
  you said it was ` rejected by her cabinet ' . 
  you ow n't mind if i take the rest of your nonsense with a large pinch of salt , given that you seem prepared either to lie or to talk out of your arse . 
  * http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/jun/16/northernireland.catholicism  * the illegal possession of a firearm does not make you a terrorist * are you trying to dispute the fact that sands was a terrorist ? 
   * not a bunch of republicans , a majority of constituents * sinn fein supporters . 
  republicans . 
  or do you think that people who voted sinn fein were not republicans ? 
  you might get away in / r/europe talking rubbish to mainland continentals who may not be too au fait with what went on . 
  it wo n't wash with me . 
  i love the way you 've been downvoted for reasonably supplying facts and argument that people here simply find * inconvenient * . 
  how very reddit . 
   * another is destroying the whole british manufacturing sector * manufacturing output as a % ge of gdp was higher when thatcher left office than when she came in . 
  she did n't destroy manufacturing . 
  it 's true there were * fewer people * employed in manufacturing ... 
   * that the irish population in the north should be `` relocated '' to the republic , an idea that was fortunately rejected immediately by her cabinet . 
  * utter nonsense . 
  an idea was kicked around in a discussion about ` encouraging ' people who apparently did n't want to live in the uk to move to the country they did want to live in . 
  it was quickly shot down . 
  and it was n't raised in cabinet . 
   * then there 's the 1981 hunger strike where she let prisoners starve themselves to death because they wanted more rights that she would n't allow them , such as the right to wear their own clothes * they were terrorists who murdered people . 
  if convicted murderers want to starve themselves to death that 's their business . 
   * was even a member of the uk parliament . 
  * because a bunch of republicans voted for a terrorist , yes . 
  well ... 
  given that modern-day greece has about as much in common with ancient athens as london does , and that many more people visit london , perhaps it 's a good idea to keep them there so that more people can share in our joint cultural heritage ? 
  after all , it 's not as though the marbles are going to be glued back onto the parthenon . 
  yes , the peice he did on wagner was toe-curling when he had a go on playing on wagner 's own piano and squirmed with pleasure and delight at playing the wrong note at the end of the liebestod . 
  sounds to me like you 're bit resentful you 're from a rather overlooked country . 
  never mind , i thought ptuj was very nice when i was there . 
  i 'm sure that , as long as you 're not representative of people from your country , slovenia might be able to make some decent money from tourism . 
  you 're confusing the collapse of the wall with the reunification of germany . 
   * no real political scientist belives that she somehow speed up the fall of the eastern block . 
  * what a silly thing to say . 
  for a start , here 's the economist :  * many things caused the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , but the clarity of mrs thatcher 's beliefs was a vital factor * here 's the guardian :  * she was a leading force in undermining the power of the soviet union . 
  * now , not ` political scientists ' , true . 
  but both opinions not easily dismissed ... except by you . 
  so what about radek sikorski , the polish foreign minister ? 
  thatcher was : `` fearless champion of liberty '' who `` helped the free world win the cold war ''  * she helped revive dying british economy * yes , she did . 
  here 's the ft , for example , if you 're interested in a few facts , which i 'm sure your ' e not : http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7c3d0cee-a06c-11e2-88b6-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2qkcvg3uc  * is is good , because the falklands are the ancient british teritory ? 
  or maybe not ? 
  * the people living on it are british in the main and have been for generations . 
  the islands were uninhabited when discovered and after a bit of fighting between spain and the uk in the early 19th c were settled by britons . 
  there was a recent 99 % in favour vote for remaining british . 
  argentina invaded when it was run by a fascist military dictatorship . 
  and that 's where your sympathies lie . 
   * i was n't talking about the nyt , only about the dm . 
  you just wrote :  * the problem is , the only one who is reporting the `` eastern european '' factor is the dm , * i just read your reply out to my partner , so gobsmacked am i by you sheer stupidity . 
  she said , ` he sounds a bit thick ' . 
   * the problem is , the only one who is reporting the `` eastern european '' factor is the dm * jesus , how dim can you be . 
  did you miss the part where [ ** i pointed out that the new york times ** ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1c91rz/louvre_forced_to_close_as_workers_walk_off_job_in/c9ecaq1 ) ** had ** reported the eastern european factor . 
  you are * so * concerned with riding your petty hobby-horse about the dm you 're having to make up claims that are palpably wrong and which you 've already been shown are wrong . 
  i think dumping low-level waste 's absolutely fine , yes , i do .
