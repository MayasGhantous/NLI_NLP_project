  but as i say , do n't stay in cornwall . 
   * i see little point in the british media kicking up a fuss about somewhat old-fashioned turkish laws when there 's plenty of ridiculous laws to be upset about in britain . 
  * this is a false equivalence . 
  there are no laws in britain that would prevent you doing what this guy did . 
  things like the twitter joke trial are the consequence of the law and the judiciary struggling to keep to with a changing world of communications , not of an inherently repressive regime . 
   * i suggest you sleep with one of those barrels under your bed * i 'm happy with it in the english channel . 
  where would you like to put it ? 
   * i actively seek out those that do n't try to `` interpret '' the news for me ( when not an opinion piece ) , and reject those that do * so as salon , the beeb and the guardian did n't report the eastern european connection ; and as it 's very likely true , given that the nyt did report it ; will you now be rejecting salon , the beeb and the guardian for ` interpreting ' the news for you ? 
   * if instead you and others would hold journalists ' feet to the fire to demand truthfulness in reporting * well i am are n't i. 
  it 's you who is n't . 
  i 'd like the bbc , the guardian and salon to mention that eastern european factor and then i can decide what to make of it . 
  it 's you who 's shooting the messenger . 
   * however protesting at the people who are mourning is not * it easily could be . 
  incidentally , in using the phrase ` the liberal media ' i 'm not making the claim that all the media is liberal - in your us sense of the word . 
  i 'm simply pointing out that a subsection has a liberal bent , and that tendency in this instance is what 's led them to drop a certain fact they 're uncomfortable about . 
  when i 'm describing a subset of the media that traditionally , habitually and self-avowedly leans away from the right and towards the left , what phrase would your fastidious sensibilities permit me to use ? 
  missed the [ kurants too ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurentovanje ), 
   * that the daily mail is simply wrong * no i did n't . 
  a consequence of the possibility i mentioned - ` perhaps the gangs are n't comprised of more eastern europeans than before ' - would be that the dm is wrong . 
  however , you 're letting your bias show again because this would mean that the nyt was also wrong . 
   * that 's why i do n't trust them as a news source * that 's fair enough : but obviously , given the above , you should n't simply accept any individual source or even many sources . 
  the beeb , the guardian and salon have all omitted something here . 
   * i 'll stand by my practice of immediately downvoting any daily mail article * brave boy . 
   * force people to integrate * he did n't say ` force ' . 
  there are a myriad of policy methods and social mores one could use to help people integrate without forcing anyone . 
  pot , meet kettle ,, 
  well it 's a bit difficult to get the full picture from many other sources is n't it ? 
  while the new york times mentions that ` pickpockets are often minors from eastern and central europe ' http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/strike-over-pickpockets-shuts-the-louvre/ the guardian : http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/10/louvre-closed-pickpockets salon : http://www.salon.com/2013/04/12/louvre_staff_strikes_against_roving_bands_of_pickpockets_partner/ and the bbc : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22098102 do n't mention the ` eastern european ' connection . 
  now several things might be happening here . 
  perhaps the gangs are n't comprised of more eastern europeans than before . 
  perhaps they are but that fact is immaterial . 
  perhaps they are , the fact 's immaterial , and mentioning it would be socially divisive and antagonistic . 
  here 's what i think : the bbc , the guardian and salon have deliberately omitted the ` eastern european ' factor because it suits their political & social beliefs not to mention it . 
  i also think that deliberately editing possibly salient facts out of news reporting because they 're uncomfortable to one 's prejudices actually panders to the far right racists . 
  if they can point to what they can plausibly describe as deliberate censorship they 'll find their venom easier to sell . 
  so perhaps better save your attacks for the nannyish liberal media that obviously believes * pas devant les enfants * is a founding principle of journalism . 
  or inventing the web . 
  or discovering the structure of dna , penicillin and vitamin b12 . 
  or inventing calculus & classical mechanics & gravitational theory . 
  or describing antimatter & inventing the dirac equation . 
  that sort of stuff . 
   * polluted the oceans and seas to the maximum levels * it 's * low-level * waste . 
  if you 're bothered about it i advise you never to visit cornwall . 
  it 's low-level waste . 
  it 's fine . 
  _ the british barrels are estimated to have contained 58 trillion becquerels ... by way of comparison , the european union 's limit for drinking water is 10 becquerels per liter _ tell you what : let 's not drink it then . 
  i 'm unclear about any reading of ` prat ' other than as an expression of disapproval of someone you think vaguely laughable . 
  does it actually mean anything more than , `` i do n't like him '' ? 
  and if that 's the case , can it really just be his voice ? 
  i think people consistently underestimate him because of the posh boy background . 
  a first from oxford , and bogadanor said he was one of the ablest students he 'd ever taught ; not someone to be casually dismissed . 
  and on the personal front , the tragedy of his son , ivan , i think , revealed a genuinely honest and human side to him . 
  obviously , no reason to support him politically just for those reasons or indeed for many other . 
  but i do n't think ` prat ' really captures him . 
  the camerons are prats why ? 
  because you disagree with his politics ? 
  i always hated the term ` ethnic cleansing ' . 
  i was shocked when the bbc started using it - it seemed to me to be complicit in the yugoslav wars of the 90s . 
  so , a loaded term for me and anyway it 's one that implies forcible removal - which is what the op falsely claimed had been proposed and which was n't actually proposed . 
  so , no , not ` ethnic cleansing ' . 
   * you could make the point though that the north should never have been partitioned in the first place * and you could make the claim that settlers should n't have been settled . 
  and as the joke - about an irishman , as it happens - goes , * i would n't start from here * . 
  we were where we were back in the 80s . 
  ireland had been partitioned . 
  william of orange had happened . 
  cromwell had happened . 
  the question was , what on earth to do about what we were faced with , * then * . 
  ` encouraged ' resettlement probably was n't ever going to go anywhere after the briefest of considerations but it 's a useful environment that fosters throwing out such off-the-wall suggestions . 
  and - to the annoyance of the rabidly anti-thatcher brigade - she was sort of known for enjoying kicking around ideas and arguing herself to conclusions . 
  the unionist population were already living in the uk . 
  the republicans were demanding that ni secede from the union and join eire - although i have half a memory that the irish constitution held that the northern counties were in fact already part of eire . 
  also , the unionist population were in a majority in the north . 
  also , the majority of the uk population did n't wish ni to leave . 
  so , more problems and more involved in doing it the other way about . 
  so the same could n't be said , no . 
  however , no harm kicking it about as an idea when you 're trying to find a solution to ireland in the 80s . 
  i note i 've collected 2 downvotes for my previous contribution . 
  i see reddit is still scared of reason and fact . 
  [ ed : and already a downvote for this . 
  what are you people scared of ? ], 
  why a joke ? 
  firstly , the op 's submission title is inaccurate . 
  thatcher did n't suggest ` forceful ' - or forcible , even - deportation but * encouragement * . 
  the analogy is to cromwell 's atrocities but thatcher was n't suggesting anything of the sort . 
  secondly , kicking around some out-of-the-box ideas late at night is , i 'm sure , absolutely usual and to be welcomed . 
  thirdly , offering encouragement to ni republicans to resettle in the country they so longed to be a part of might n't have been such a daft idea . 
  finally - and i keep having to make this point - there are plenty of reasonable arguments against thatcher and various facets of thatcherism . 
  when you have to mispreresent , make things up , and lie : then it looks like you 're losing . 
  you wrote :  * having police raid people 's homes and drag people out just for belonging to a union . 
  * which is utter bollocks . 
  you know , it really weakens any argument against thatcher 's actual policies when people see you needing to resort to palpable nonsense like this . 
  my irony attennae were n't working . 
  but you 've already said it collapsed from - partly - economic pressure . 
  what was the nature of that pressure ? 
  yup , the problem with counter-cyclical keynsian spending is that there 's never the political will to do the other half of what keynes said was necessary - * reducing * public spending during growth . 
  any other bright ideas ? 
  no , you . 
  you are antisemitic . 
  i think you were talking about thatcher ` having ' the police raid homes because their occupants were trades unionists , were n't you ? 
  or are you quickly changing the subject because you 're talking balls ?
