  you could be even-handed . 
  very obviously this union is in calling for action only against one country , israel, 
  you 're an expert in international law ? 
  i 've read that it was legal . 
  it should focus in the worst . 
  the claim that israel is the worst is simply thinly-veiled antisemitism, 
  that 's exceedingly poor . 
  an analogy would n't be with actually taking action but with calling for action to be taken . 
  that does n't cost anything but if you really had to prioritise right down to just one nation the ridiculous assertion that it 's israel , of all nations in the world , that needs to be singled out is such a transparently defenceless , antisemitic position i really do n't know why you do n't just start humming the horst wessel song right now . 
  that was the flotilla attempting to break the blockade that the un says is a perfectly legal blockade ? 
  no , my point was that this is an instance of antisemitism , and that fact is clear when you consider this union is not calling for sanctions against anyone else in the world , at all . 
  your pointing out that other people have called for or enacted sanctions against other countries does n't address the single focus of this particular organisation . 
  there : is that a little clearer for you ? 
   * let 's ignore the sanctions on iraq , iran , zimbabwe etc. 
  let 's not even talk about america 's illegal sanctions against cuba * sorry , what does this irish teaching union have to do with any of these ? 
   * independence from britain by not getting involved in another war that was seen as theirs * it was a war against fascism that eire decided not to support . 
  and you must explain how your ` analysis ' leads to the spectacle of the irish president offering formal condolences to the nazi regime on the death of hitler . 
  such a blow for independence . 
   * every israeli is still part of an invading force * eh ? 
  who has israel invaded ? 
  which infant israeli has invaded whom ? 
   * any attacks against israeli civilian or military targets are legitimate uses of defensive force * ahhh ... you 're just a fuckwit . 
  no , calling for a boycott against israel and only against israel , out of all the countries in the world , is evidence enough of pure antisemitism . 
   * but i guess israel must not be criticized . 
  * complete red herring . 
  this is n't about criticising israel . 
  this is about a call for a boycott only against israel , out of all the countries in the world . 
  israel 's existence is all that was needed to piss off their neighbours . 
  nothing more . 
   * south africa was a democracy during apartheid * what the fuck are you blathering on about ? 
   * firstly you have to understand the irish mentality * i think you simply have to remember eire 's neutrality in wwii and the message of condolence sent by de valera to the germans on the death of hitler to understand the irish mentality here . 
   * i , a german who had been spoonfed holocaust for most of his school career * well i * do * beg your pardon . 
  perhaps we should n't have bothered . 
  in fact . 
  for all the good it 's done in your case , we obviously need n't have bothered . 
  do you mean i have posted there ? 
  and have you read my comments there ? 
  it 's antisemitism when , out of all the countries in the world , this union calls for an academic boycott only of israel . 
  that is english . 
  as a welshman i 'd like to say that welsh * is n't * worth learning . 
  you have limited time and possibilities to learn foreign languages . 
  do n't waste your time with welsh . 
   * well , i 've been * no you have n't . 
  you 've been trying - as best you 're able - to indicate how some scientific research has or has n't suggested that neanderthal dna exists in humans . 
  that 's not discussing * science * per se . 
   * but you kept on saying that there is no evidence of a neanderthal-modern hybrid . 
   liar . 
  this was you :  * there 's no direct evidence for the existence of neanderthal-modern hybrids * http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1big19/trove_of_neanderthal_bones_found_in_greece/c97l3es  * and yes , indeed i am a silly person * absolutely . 
  but i do n't know * what * the edit was , do i ? 
   * i 'm just accurate as it 's science we 're discussing . 
  * actually , we were n't discussing ` science ' . 
  we were discussing , were n't we , whether there was evidence of neanderthal dna in modern humans . 
  here 's where it started : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1big19/trove_of_neanderthal_bones_found_in_greece/c978rqf  * no expert seriously thinks that the species h. neanderthalensis would be still extant * no . 
  but you kept on saying that there is no evidence of a neanderthal-modern hybrid . 
  as if you were expecting one . 
  and if not then what 's your point ? 
  there are certainly some contested fossils : and there is very compelling dna evidence . 
  and remember the original point . 
   * now who 's the silly person here . 
  * you . 
   * but instead you seem both arrogant and illiterate , a combination native anglophones * you really are an arse , are n't you . 
  [ ignored ], 
  ... and i would have known that original had been corrected ... how ? 
   * sky is partly owned by rupert murdock * what an excellent argument you make . 
  well done . 
  ` cue ' is correct here ... 
   * i for one think that if it was n't for the americans to watch over you ( and the french ) , the after war situation could have been much worse for germany , because england is n't exactly well known for it 's kindness and indulgence when invading other countries * and that 's what your argument is reduced to ? 
  speculative counterfactuals based on nothing but your own prejudice . 
   * we germans understand why the bombs are here , and we accept this historic fact * i really do n't think * you * do . 
  you claimed , falsely , that it was the aim of britain to destroy the german people . 
  it never was . 
  in parroting such a filthy lie you 're very clearly indicating where your sympathies are . 
  and if you think the future lies with your revisionism and false equivalence between totalitarian fascism and the people who tried to * stop * totalitarian fascism then you 're an utter fool . 
  well that 's ok then . 
  we do n't need to apologise for trying to stop hitler after all ... 
  you cleared nothing up . 
  you simply and disingenuously pretended curiosity to give yourself a chance to parade some sophomoric understanding of history ... and your effort fell flat . 
  well i do n't and did n't so , curiosity assuaged , you can be on you way ca n't you . 
  your point ? 
  i thought you were just asking a question . 
  you know , out of ` genuine curiosity ' ? 
  do you mean , by ` involvement ' , was it the reason for going to war ? 
  do you mean by ` involvement ' , did it become part of rationale ? 
  yes . 
  you 're right . 
  you really should n't have bothered getting involved . 
  for all your ` genuine ' * curiosity * . 
  that 's a rather different point to the one i was arguing . 
  so , assuming you 've conceded my point , then to address your question : in the circumstances , yes . 
  in the circumstances of total war where the entire economy is bent to support the war , and the vast majority of the population are supporting the war , either overtly or tacitly , and where it 's the only thing to do , or a reasonable supposition at the time that it 's the only thing to do , to stop genocidal maniacs completely obliterating every single jew in europe : yes . 
  no , it was n't . 
  i really am getting rather troubled by you , a german , being so clueless . 
  clueless or else happy to continue lying about the war . 
  look : you lost , right ? 
  and what did we then do ? 
  destroy germany and its people ? 
  as soon as you gave up we stopped bombing , stopped shooting , and waded in to try to help . 
  on the other hand , if germany had won , where do you think the jews would be today ? 
  and there 's the difference . 
  you disgust me .
