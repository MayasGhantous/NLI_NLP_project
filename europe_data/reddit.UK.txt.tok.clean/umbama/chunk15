  shalle we take them one at a time ? 
   * failure to oversee the financial sector * this is a crime ? 
  done as in , just had to write that ? 
  how will they tell ? 
   * they should be publicly tried * on what charge , mr hysteric ? 
  more blather . 
  ** onerichbastard ** : [ * lower income does not generate crime . 
  * ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1aeldb/swiss_woman_gangraped_in_central_india/c8wz5x9 ) ** you ( in reply ) ** : * that 's just demonstrably wrong . 
  * linking to [ ** this on wikipedia ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/causes_and_correlates_of_crime#socioeconomic_factors ) . 
  your fantastically dishonest ` argument ' might convince a casual reader if you had n't left your comments for all to see . 
   * which is not the same as to say that low income is a direct cause * no it is n't the same . 
  but you 're positing a causal relationship and you 're doing it without evidence or argument and your supposed sources do n't support you . 
  did you have anything else to add ? 
  but - putting aside the question of whether capitalism is sensibly called a ` value ' for a moment - what is your difficulty here with these facts . 
  poverty has been our natural condition . 
  we seem to have stumbled upon a mechanism for alleviating it . 
  it does n't happen overnight and we 've met quite some opposition in attempting to spread it around . 
  but it 's working . 
   * that does not mean that all western values are not questionable . 
  * so which ? 
  rule of law ? 
  equality before the law ? 
  freedom of opinion and expression ? 
  freedom of association ? 
  the scientific method ? 
  the work ethic ? 
  these are all fundamental western values and activities . 
  yes , i speak english . 
  you said ;  * given some context the first link still stands * which it does n't as an an indication of cause . 
  poverty has been humankind 's persistent condition for nearly all of its history . 
  right up until a few hundred years ago most people lived on about the equivalent of # 2,000 pa * in today 's money terms * . 
  they did n't have enough , or varied food . 
  they died in droves . 
  they did n't travel or take foreign holidays . 
  they were cold . 
  as a * result * of capitalism - well , trade and market activity to be exact - we in the west have seen a staggering rise in our wealth over the last 300 years , a rise unprecedented in history . 
  and it does n't stop there . 
   * we 've seen inequality rise and rise since the '70s * in fact the number of people living in poverty has plummeted : * defining poverty as less than $ 1/day , world poverty rates fell by 80 % from 27 % in 1970 to slightly more than 5 % in 2006 . 
  * the corresponding total number of poor fell from 403 million in 1970 to 152 million in 2006 . 
  * similar findings apply if other poverty measures are used ( $ 2/day , 5 $ / day , etc ) http://bluematter.blogspot.cz/2009/10/global-poverty-and-inequality-1970-2006.htm  * i 'm feeling a bit depressed now * you should feel happier unless your concerns are purely personal . 
  the * annual * drop in child mortality in countries such as senegal , rwanda , kenya , uganda , zambia and many others is between 5 and 10 % . 
  the * annual * drop . 
  this is the direct result of us in the west buying things made by poor people in poor countries . 
  trade and investment * is working * . 
   * we allow large corporations to become so powerful * do you know who invented the re-hydration drink that the who says in very much responsible for the reduction in mortality among small children ? 
  the company known in the us as gatorade . 
  cheer up . 
  things are getting better . 
   * the latter link 's purpose was to illustrate a correlation * no , you said in response to a contribution that claimed ` lower income does not generate crime ' :  * that 's just demonstrably wrong ... * and that was your link . 
  now you 're just lying . 
   * hich are accessible mostly to elites ( dante , beethoven . . * in what way is beethoven not accessible to everybody else ? 
  look : beethoven : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uoxogm5jq4#t=1m0s ** that was soooo difficult to access !!!, 
  ** more http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhvypmdcafw#t=5m22s ** oooh , so terribly difficult !!, 
  ** http://www.gutenberg.org/files/8799/8799-h/8799-h.htm#link1 ** no , the sheer struggle of ` accessing ' dante ** it 's all * tooooo * much . 
  but what does it all * mean * ? 
  well let 's see shall we : http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00f05zj http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/info/40009/leeds_centre_for_dante_studies/1041/leeds_dante_podcast you do n't actually mean , do you , that it 's accessible only to ` elites ' . 
  this careless , obnoxious , class-based antagonsim is tiresome . 
  the culture and the exploration of it are there for everyone now , more than ever before , * if they wish to engage * . 
  which western values would you question ? 
   * saying that everyplace except europe is unsafe for woman is a mind-boggling close-minded argument . 
  * i think you intended to reply to someone else . 
  i 've said nothing of the sort . 
   * i do n't think this means that i can not talk about this subject at all * oh i 'm sorry . 
  i was sure you were the person who wrote :  * since i am not a woman , i can not vouch personally for the woman-friendliness of most places though *, 
  then it 's emphatically not the same is it . 
  in cyprus , only savers will be penalised . 
  you 're link does n't provide a causal connection, 
  rape has a comparable conviction rate to other violent crimes , if you look at the conviction rate as the proportion of convictions of those actually charged and brought to trial . 
  crime conviction rates are usually calculated in proportion to numbers eventually charged , not numbers initially reported but not charged . 
  it 's only with the rape stats you habitually sees this deliberately confusing and anomolous way of presenting the figures . 
   * most of the rest of the world is fine ( since i am not a woman , i can not vouch personally for the woman-friendliness of most places though  * given that this thread is about the rape abroad of a european woman , where on a scale of 1 to 10 would you place the stupidity of that remark ? 
  yes , and in doing that , in the context of this discussion , you meant to imply absolutely nothing at all . 
  of course . 
  of course . 
  you seem , though , to be suggesting that that state is having all sorts of problems . 
  why are you suggesting * poverty * is the cause of the rapes ? 
  for one thing , what on earth do you suppose would be the causal mechanism ? 
  i 'm more inclined to suppose that there are numerous factors feeding into this . 
  it 's an absurd and hardly comprehensible reductionism to simply say it was poverty that did it . 
  no : there may be a correlation with some kinds of crime . 
  you 've yet to argue for or demonstrate a causal relationship . 
  it could be that poverty is a rough proxy for other things that lead to crime . 
  how absurd , and deeply racist , to assert indians lack a culture or a cultural identity . 
  ` boredom ' ? 
  well that 's the claim , yes , well done you for repeating it . 
  and of course some crime is correlated with poverty . 
  of course ` poverty ' might be a broad-brush proxy for something else , might n't it ? 
  so what is it about poverty that causes men to rape , do you think ? 
  sorry , what does poverty have to do with gang rape ? 
  i dispute the assertion that * representations * of common gender roles are perpetuating gender stereotypes or that that 's necessarily a bad thing or that it 's the state 's job to limit freedom through legislation or that stereotypes can be eliminated by banning porn , any more than the abolition of * representations * of nazis in films about wwii would eliminate fascism ; i dispute that * porn * sexualises women , if i even understand what that 's supposed to mean . 
  men find women sexually attractive and respond significantly more than women to visual representations ; that 's simply a fact and a desire porn serves . 
  porn does n't create the desire or the biological facts . 
  so you 're only talking about porn involving women , are you ? 
  so gay porn aimed at males will escape the ban ? 
  or has n't this occurred to you ? 
  what 's the noble idea ? 
   * because they are industries where profits should be secondary to the good of the people . 
  * same go for food provision ? 
  that 's pretty staple is n't it , food ? 
  no she did n't .
