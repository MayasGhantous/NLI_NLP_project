   * replacing a local ( or non-existing ) population * how do you replace a non-existing population ? 
  it seems that you agree with me . 
  why did you downvote ? 
  an example of paying attention to reddiquette or a childish response to an argument you find awkward ? 
   * government money * the government has its own money ? 
  i think you have a fair point about employers ' disincentives . 
  but you 've also made the assertion that ` balance ' requires equal time from both mother and father . 
  that 's an ideological assertion : it may be the case - and i 'd say seems highly probable - that women are more inclined to be nurturing of infants and more often * wish to be * that person . 
  people are n't blank slates . 
   * attempts at nhs privatization * more like france , do you mean ? 
   * the snubbing of the levenson inquiry * has n't been ` snubbed ' . 
   * the somewhat sad death of vote reform * you mean the dismal av lost the argument with the people ? 
   * the perception of banking as a national asset * which it is, 
  absolutely . 
  let 's just get rid of the politicians altogether and have bureaucrats run the eu . 
   * a directly elected commission would just be another popularity contest * we usually call it democracy over here in the uk . 
  because irish politicians bent themselves to the will and diktats of brussels rather than listen to their people ? 
  you know ... something undemocratic like that . 
  the council and the parliament do n't have legislative initiative . 
  only the * commission * , which represents the interests not of member states but of the eu , can propose legislation . 
  the institutions with the greatest democratic legitimacy have a weaker , smaller role . 
  and more : from the social perspective there is no * demos * in europe , no citizen body with an active interest in governance of the whole union , and who participate and direct their claims to the union institutions . 
  there is no ` eu ' civic identity . 
   * what does eu have to do with ireland having two referendums on the lisbon treaty * nothing at all ... nothing to see here at all ... nope ... just those pesky irish being eccentric again ... 
   * what are you talking about * a democratic deficit in eu institutions  * who proposed giving more power to the european parliament * well ... exactly my point ... 
   * dissolution of countries * jeez ... 
  members of the elected parliament ca n't propose legislation ? 
  the eu ignored the revolt against lisbon ? 
  no idea about homophobic . 
  i have no privileged access to their private mental states re . 
  mysogny ( are you including the women in that too or are you rather mysogynistically only including ukip 's male members and supporters in your assessment ? ) . 
  and i have no idea what you imagine you mean by ` imperialist classist ', 
  every party has racists in it and racists who vote for it . 
  ukip probably has its fair share and because of the way it 's depicted , probably more than its fair share . 
  but with its emphasis on commonwealth trade links rather than relying on trade with the largely white european continent , and with its leader married to a german , i think it 's less than obvious that ukip is inherently racist . 
  i 've known racist labour and tory and lib dem voters . 
  the basic racism of labour is much more noticeable , in the lower expectations the * bien pensants * of the left have for non-whites . 
  the progressive failure to condemn racism , homophobia and sexism among certain minority groups is * deeply * racist as it holds non-whites to lower standards than whites . 
  and it 's ubiquitous on the left . 
   * thinly veiled racists basically * oh , rubbish . 
   * most limited liability corporations are a front made to deceive people * oh ffs , the limited liability company is an invention that 's been fantasically important - and necessary - to the massive increase in wealth we 've seen in the west in the past couple of hundred years . 
  er ... so ... you think the government - what - borrowed a whole load of money and then ... er ... spent it on a foreign holiday & expensive restaurants ? 
   * a debt they did n't contract * in what way did n't they contract it ? 
   * traveling the world * the world ? 
   * could easily have ruled the world if they would have wanted to * so what happened ? 
  that may be people just disagreeing that racism is a particular problem just at this moment and disagreeing with you for your lack of historical perspective . 
  er ... anyone * other than the germans * perhaps [ ed : i see a few downvotes . 
  would anyone downvoting like to explain why they 're downvoting ? ], 
  germans just not getting the internet again ... 
   * i think it is perfectly ok with being right-wing , * who mentioned being right-wing ? 
  ok , i was quoting a claim made by trevor philips , the ( black ) chairman of the uk equality and human rights commission - and he , i 'm sure , was using ` race ' in a broader sense , not to suggest there 's something ineluctably criminal about an entire race - but more in the social / cultural sense . 
  so , taking your points . 
  does it exist . 
  yes , there is an over-representation by asians whose family origins are in pakistan :  * last week mohammed shafiq , chief executive of the ramadhan foundation , said : `` there is an over-representation [ of asian men ] amongst recent convictions in the crime of on-street grooming [ and ] there should be no silence in addressing the issue of race as this is central to the actions of these criminals , '' he said . 
  * http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18092605 2 . 
  what 's the reason for it ? 
  i 'd say it 's a number of factors including but not limited to : the position of women in islam ; a sexually distorting culture ; a culture that 's derogatory of women and non-muslims . 
   * you and a lot of other xenophobes * i 'm not a xenophobe . 
  you 're the one denying the facts or declining to do the most basic googling to inform yourself of them . 
  i think under the circumstances i 'm being very temperate . 
   * assuming you 're talking `` the liberal party '' * no , never mind , you 're missing the subtleties of politics here in the uk . 
  i did n't mention the lib dems i said my view these days incline more towards the classical liberal of mill - but again , if you ca n't be bothered to google yourself out of ignorance you can let it pass , it does n't matter . 
   * the other stuff that 's all the jive in / r/europe * there are of course racists around . 
  racists like those criminals who targetted white girls , for example . 
  there are some on reddit . 
  but they 're not anything like the majority . 
  your difficulty is a propensity to leap on any discussion of fact that disturbs you as evidence of racism . 
  and as i 've repeatedly said , sticking your head in the sand is a very , very inadequate response . 
  it 's why the bnp picks up votes - because sensible people are n't taking the facts head on and trying to talk about them reasonably , in the way i have here ( and for my pains been called a racist , a xenophobe , and suchlike ) . 
   * wait , now you lost me . 
  you just said it was . 
  which is it ? 
  * when and where did i say that ? 
   * while the truth is that networks of pedophile criminals are being discovered among the white majority just as often . 
  * you 're missing - and i have to conclude now you 're deliberately missing - the * over-representation * of some groups . 
   * introduce the caliphate state through cunningly having sex with children somehow ... * and while you go on typifying the views of those you think are somehow your opponents in this caricatured way , your stubborn blindness will be used time and again by the right to raise alarm about ignored facts . 
   * your whackjob political opinions * well now ... when i was young i joined the british labour party , rejoined when blair became leader , am not now a member , and my political views are more a sort of classical liberal these days . 
  think j s mill . 
  if you think that 's ` whackjob ' you 're just an idiot . 
  nobody has ever said ` muslims are paedophiles ' . 
  all some people are saying is : * the media are fighting shy of mentioning some salient facts * among those facts are : * muslims from the indian sub-continent are overly represented as perpetrators * white girls are overly represented as victims * your * claim is the demonstrably false one : that there is zero evidence for this . 
  it 's * your * claim that will play into the hands of the bnp because they can point to you and show how you 're willfully denying obvious facts . 
  this is n't about race . 
  it 's about a subculture of a subculture of a religious and regional culture . 
  islam * per se * is n't at fault - not entirely , although the story of muhammad 's having sex with a 9 year-old does n't help - but rather the distorting lens of religious a social mores that despise non-muslims and denigrate women . 
  * and that is the truth * . 
  oh do n't be so desperately dim ... two of them are called muhammad ffs . 
  if you 're reduced to this , ask yourself , what do you think you 're protecting and how effectively do you think you 're doing it ? 
  everyone else can read your response . 
  it 's pathetic . 
  look : you 're doing a * disservice * to what you think is your cause , or the people you 're trying to protect . 
  most people in britain , muslim or otherwise , are fairly decent and do n't get involved in this sort of thing . 
  but when it happens and you refuse to acknowledge an obviously salient point it plays into the hadns of the likes of the bnp who talk about the liberal media 's refusal to acknowledge certain facts . 
  so acknowledge them . 
  understand them . 
  stop trying to deny them . 
   * muslims have a higher prevalence of pedophilia and/or rapists , and that it is somehow targeted at white people . 
  there 's absolutely zero evidence of this * actually , this is the case and there is evidence for it . 
  as the chairman of the equality and human rights commission pointed out in the rochdale case , claiming that race is n't a factor is fatuous . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9263050/claiming-rochdale-grooming-not-about-race-is-fatuous-trevor-phillips.html sorry if it offends your liberal prejudices but there we are .
