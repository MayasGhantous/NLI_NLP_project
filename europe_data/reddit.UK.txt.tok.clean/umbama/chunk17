  you 've contradicted yourself in two successive comments . 
  you first claimed that one would have to learn the basics of the language ; now you 're claiming you have to learn more than the basics of the language . 
  tell you what . 
  why do n't you have a think about what stupid opinion you 'd like to stick to and then get back to me . 
  that is n't the assertion i 've challenged . 
  i can learn the basics , as anyone would , living in a country ; the question is whether i need more than that to work . 
  did you not understand ? 
  it is n't a pun ... but i missed your irony , it 's true . 
   * redditors are not above average intelligent/educated . 
  * i think they probably are, 
   * generalizations never contribute to anything . 
  * never ? 
  that 's a pretty contestable generalisation , is n't it ? 
   * learn english . 
  allows you to work in britain and ireland ( about 15 % of the job market ) *  * learn german . 
  allows you to work in germany , austria , parts of switzerland ( about 20 % of the job market ) . 
  * except ... that 's not how the options go . 
  i know of a german company that has sizeable operational presences in the uk , germany and romania . 
  what do you think they use as the * lingua franca * ? 
  english of course . 
   * a slight dislike for the english and americans is suddenly the same as xenophobia * textbook definition really . 
  and what you actually claimed was that the chinese were more honest . 
   * 40 years ago you were one of the poorest european countries * eh ? 
  no , it wo n't ` work ' . 
  would it be possible for you to change your plans to take in italy ? 
  i 'm from the uk , i 've traveled all over the continent and though i 'm a bit surprised at my conclusion - because personally i 'm nothing like the stereotypical italian character - i think italy is the loveliest country in europe . 
  water is perfectly rivalrous and perfectly excludable . 
  you 're simply not using the term in the sense economists use it . 
  you seem to think the term ` public good ' simply means , ` good for the public ' . 
  that is n't what it means . 
  i presume that you 're not imagining you 're using the term ` public good ' in its technical sense , public goods being non-excludable and non-rivalrous ? 
  in * your * sense , is food a public good too ? 
   * the collective view is , if the ratios are much different and can not be explained by ability , then you have a systemic discrimination * not at all . 
  you could , for example , see an effect of women taking time out of their careers to raise children . 
  no , it 's of . 
  you can strip something off , which means you tear or pull ** off ** , which is the sense you 're thinking ** of ** here : but you can take something away from someone or something and in doing deprive that person , in this instance , ** of ** a doctorate . 
  the ` of ' acts as a preposition . 
  i deprive you ** of ** that pint of beer by drinking it . 
  i stripped you ** of ** your title because you were a cheat . 
  interesting , to see what confusions can be caused in english to non-native speakers . 
  i 'd never have thought ** of ** this one , for example . 
  well , it 's not been too terrible so far has it ? 
  er ... well ... there are racist thugs and hooligans of all stripes , yes . 
  i find it peculiar to major on * that * when the issue is these patrols in the east end , though . 
  i 'm not at all trying to paint it as a bad idea . 
  i was being mildly sardonic about state-sanctioned institutions but i think this is exactly what we should do . 
  cunning plan on the naming front . 
   * anti-muslim patrols * what ? 
  where ? 
  yes . 
  so let the religious types keep marriage - they 'll make a fuss otherwise - and let everyone else have an official state approved inclusive non-discriminatory civil partnership ( type 2 ), 
  wow . 
  not quite the same rights . 
  you have no recourse to a defence of marital coercion ... , 
  you can call them what you like . 
  what 's in a name ? 
   * why should n't gay people who are in love be entitled to the same benefits as a hetero couple ? 
  * presumably because the state 's interest starts and ends with ensuring the most stable background for bringing up kids . 
  here 's my suggestion : the state should be involved in sanctioning civil partnerships , gay and straight , * full stop * . 
  then if anyone wants to go and get a ` traditional marriage ' they can do what they like outside the aegis of the state . 
  this is largely true and it 's shameful you get downvoted for it . 
  i keep on prefacing my remarks by saying i do n't actually agree with the anti view , just to try to forestall the knee-jerk downvoters . 
  all i 'm saying is that there is an alternative view - mistaken , i think - that is at least comprehensible . 
  perhaps instead of acting dumb or hurling insults at each other we could - you know - * discuss * . 
  ... and i get downtvotes ... 
  newspeak : the attempt in ' 1984 ' to gradually change the english language , to reduce it , to remove nuances , to change the meaning of words , until it became literally impossible not only to * write * things the state disapproved of but impossible even to think the thoughts . 
  so by analogy , the effort to redefine the meaning of a word - marriage - and its historical meaning and accompanying tradition . 
  as i say : i disagree but it 's perfectly comprehensible rhetoric . 
  i do n't understand your difficulty . 
   * called the bill `` orwellian . '', 
  i ca n't even begin to get my head around how that makes any sense . 
  * it 's easily understandable . 
  orwell - 1984 - newspeak . 
  you do n't have to agree with him - and i do n't - but the language , and the claim , is perfectly comprehensible . 
   * yes i did , and i do n't undestand what you mean * oh , ok , it 's just that you used a different word in your reply and said you thought i 'd made a typo . 
  obviously , i 'd conclude from that that you 'd understood perfectly ... 
   * err on the side of saving money , as opposed to erring on the side of effectiveness , * i think they 're not saving money and they 're not effective . 
  you do n't seem to have that as an option . 
  so ... you ca n't agree that there 's too much bureaucracy but you have no evidence one way or the other ? 
  ` responsive ' . 
  you can look it up if you have a difficulty with it . 
   * err on the side of saving money rather than achieving goals * you think one of their goals is n't to save money ? 
   * always , yes * what evidence do you have that there 's a problem attracting bureaucrats ? 
  in what way is the bureaucracy of the eu responsive ( which was my word , not ` responsible ' ) to the people ? 
  the czech republic public officials are still highly officious and seem to believe the country is run for them . 
  that 's a typically eastern attitude . 
   * it does n't matter if you have a big public sector or a big private sector * er ... yes it does . 
  what is the public sector responsive to ? 
  how does it fail if it goes wrong ? 
   * no , i can not agree that there is too much bureaucracy * do you think the bureaucracy we have just coincidentally happens to be perfectly right , or do we need more ? 
   * you got ta pay the wages that attract the sort of people you want to employ * is there a problem attracting them ? 
   * with due regard to the legitimate claims of the tuaregs . 
  * indeed . 
  which will be better than arresting them for singing and playing musical instruments . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean by evidence here . 
  there is literally no tradition in christianity other than that the texts later compiled as the bible were written down by people , none of them under dictation from god but at the most divinely inspired . 
  by contrast the * only * tradition is islam is that muhammad wrote down the * dictation * of the angel gabriel . 
  well , i disagree . 
  i think the two figures are like gravitational attractors for the two religions . 
  i think you 're missing the point .
