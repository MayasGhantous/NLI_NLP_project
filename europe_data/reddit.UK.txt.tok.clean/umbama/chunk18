  both sets of holy texts and both tradtions come out of different times when different mores applied ; but christianity contains a slightly different approach at its core . 
  as for slavery , yes of course both religious traditions encouraged slavery ; and also christians were key to its abolition and arabs were at the heart of both the transatlantic slave trade and the rather less well-known slave trade in the east and out to the indian subcontinent that dealt in * more * slaves that the transatlantic trade . 
  i 've seen a figure of around * twice as many * african slaves in the eastern arabic slave trade compared to the transatlantic trade . 
  nah , really . 
  the central figure of christianity is a pacifist who preached love and forgiveness . 
  the central figure of islam is a warlord . 
  that * is * a significant difference - surely you can see that ? 
  do n't start me on islam and the history of slavery ... 
   * ` two equally hateful alternatives . 
  ' * really ? 
  equally ? 
  meh , i said at the core of christianity is some figure ... your link does n't address that at all . 
  nietzsche called christianity a ` slave morality ' for a reason . 
   * but it makes no difference to their belief that it is all literally word for word true and immutable * yes , a very small minority will believe in biblical inerrancy . 
  that ' a problem for them because large swathes of the bible are obviously nonsense and parts are self-contradictory . 
  so much for them . 
  but the vast majority of muslims believe the koran to be the * god 's dictation * . 
  no , that 's simply not true . 
  even fundamentalists accept that the texts themselves were written by people , albeit divinely inspired people . 
  you seem confused . 
  i think the problem lies in the conventional understanding of how the two books were produced . 
  christians accept their holy texts were written by humans ; muslims claim the koran to be , literally , the * dictation of an angel * taken down flawlessly by their prophet . 
  there 's obviously less wriggle room in the latter case . 
   * because people usually single out islam as somehow being different from other religions in terms of its core teachings . 
  * i think it is , though . 
  at the core of christianity is some figure who preached tolerance , love , turning the other cheek and non-violence . 
  at the core of islam is a guy who was himself a warrior . 
  that * is * a difference . 
   * have you read the bible and the torah recently ? 
  the argument can be made that they are no more or less inherently hate-filled and violent as islam * i do n't think that 's the contemporary issue though , is it , what weirdnesses you can find in the various texts ? 
  it 's how those texts , in all of those faiths , are understood and interpreted * today * . 
  only person i 've seen mention anything of the sort is you . 
  why did you have to date him ? 
   * ruined his legacy and his reputation so thoroughly with iraq . 
  * he did n't . 
  his opponents opposed . 
  you want to march with the swp , be my guest . 
   * tony blair is probably the most europhilliac pm the uk has ever had * heath . 
   * he is n't liked * 3 election victories says he is, 
   * widely derided as bush 's poodle ? 
  * well ... by the less intelligent of his opponents . 
   * except in official documents from the government . 
  * ... and why must that happen ? 
  why are the figures ` meaningless ' ? 
  indeed . 
  speculated . 
  it simply was n't a given , when we had the referendum , that we 'd be signing up to monetary union or budgetary oversight from brussels . 
  in fact our then prime minister assured us it would n't be the case . 
   * i did n't look at one or two polls , i looked at about a dozen * ok . 
  but you * said * three . 
  but i still do n't understand why , after you claim that british politicians are making these threats , and i ask for evidence , you 're quoting public opinion polls at me . 
  have i misunderstood something ? 
  have you ? 
   * some politicians ( minor parties count ) that advocate leaving the eu * likewise in all eu countries , i 'm sure . 
   * but he did n't propose a referendum to stay in or leave . 
  * er ... yes he did . 
   * david cameron promises in/out referendum on eu * http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21148282, 
   * a british eurosceptic political party as having been the driving force behind this referendum * no , the conservatives are the driving force behind the referendum . 
  ' a poll or two ' is simply idiomatic english , ` one or two ' means a few , a handful , not literally either one or two but nothing else . 
   * you trivialize whatever politicians i may have heard criticize the eu a * no . 
  you claimed - very clearly falsely - that you had ' barely heard a british politician mention the eu without saying that britain would be better of outside of it ' . 
  simply untrue . 
  one minor party does n't support your hyperbole , i 'm afraid . 
  my point is - i 'm not sure why you seem confused - that the ` ever closer union ' , which seems in the minds of many continentals to necessarily include monetary union , was never suggested to the british people to be a consequence of joining the eec . 
   * he saw reason to call for a referendum * political , to lance the boil of ukip , obviously . 
  this is n't rocket science . 
   * three separate recent polls ... more britons want to leave than want to stay , so your claim that no one is threating to leave rings a bit hollow * ah . 
  so you think that a poll or two conducted under uncertain conditions with no public debate beforehand is ` britain threatening to leave the eu ' . 
  * i see ... *  * i 've barely heard a british politician mention the eu without saying that britain would be better of outside of it * and all these people are politicians , are they ? 
  to claim that the uk was signing up to future monetary union is plain daft . 
   * i 've barely heard a british politician mention the eu without saying that britain would be better of outside of it , but i 'll spare you the anecdotes * except you did n't , did you . 
  you just gave the anecdote . 
  so care to back it up ? 
   * about as direct of a threat to leave the head of a democracy can make * he 's explicitly stated he wishes to stay in . 
  no , we did n't . 
  the prime minister is in favour of staying in . 
   * currently the rebate is worth # 5 billion ( gbp ) a year and the uk remains one of the largest net contributors ... as of 2004 , france gets more than twice as much cap funds than the uk ( 22 % of total funds compared to the uk 's 9 % ) which in cash terms is a net benefit that france gets over and above what the uk gets from the cap of $ 6.37 m billion . 
  in comparison , the uk budget rebate for 2005 is scheduled to be approx $ 5.5 bn . 
  *  * a popular view in the uk is that if the uk rebate were reduced with no change to the cap , then the uk would be paying money to keep an inefficient french farming sector in business *  * if the rebate were removed without changes to the cap then the uk would pay a larger net contribution than france * so let 's negotiate . 
  put the rebate on the table but put the cap on the table too . 
  i 'd be up for that . 
  how does an inefficient french agricultural sector improve its productivity if it 's cosseted from the economic facts of life ? 
  that is n't the point . 
  the claim was that the uk is threatening to leave . 
  who , exactly , is threatening to leave ? 
  oh , come off it , gdp per se is not the measure of wealth else china beats nearly everyone and it 'd be rather peculiar to argue that china is wealthy . 
  it 's gdp per capita , surely ? 
  the uk 's still ahead of france and italy now : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita, 
  yes , true , but it was the only time we had a say , and the only question was about the eec . 
  i think the figures are crap . 
  in gdp per capita or total wealth , they look crap to me . 
  ah the eu . 
  so good with money . 
   * threatening to leave everytime they 're not gaining from a measure * when have we threatened to leave ? 
   * just a foot in europe * we 're in as far as we agreed to be in . 
  it 's the other member states who are trying to * change * that agreement and have been for years . 
  we voted , remember , to join the common market . 
  who is threatening to leave ? 
  none of the political parties that will ever be in power have a policy of leaving . 
   * 1984 to reflect the fact that britain , then the eu 's second poorest member * what ?
