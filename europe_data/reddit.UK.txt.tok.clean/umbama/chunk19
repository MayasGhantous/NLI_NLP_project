  we were poorer than spain , france & italy ? 
  really ? 
  well we 've done very well since , have n't we . 
  where do your figures come from ? 
   * without the cap , food prices in the eu would be much higher * and where do you think the money for the cap comes from in the first place ? 
  the magic money tree ? 
  the uk voted yes to open markets , some time ago . 
  its the rest of the crap that 's been snuck in since , in direct contradiction to repeated assurances , that we baulk at . 
  you might have to keep your job to , you know , pay the rent . 
  you might not be very good at speaking in public . 
  ` just start your own political party ' has to be the stupidest response i 've ever read on red dit , ever, 
  i just find you boring . 
  i do n't approve of av . 
  lots of reasons , primarily that * pace * [ ** arrow 's impossibility theorem ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arrow's_impossibility_theorem ) the suggestion that it would be fairer is misconceived , and that i think it would give too much power to minority parties . 
  that said , i do n't actually see your point . 
  doubtful . 
  really doubtful . 
  er ... so you 'd have preferred al gore to bush why ? 
  try and cut out the adolescent histrionic posturing this time and just answer the question . 
  you 'd have preferred al gore ... why ? 
   * are you debating my choice of words or my point ? 
  * in what language , and where , do you imagine you made your point other than the place i linked to ? 
  no , you were saying they are the same now : http://en.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/177f56/monti_to_cameron_europe_does_not_need_unwilling/c83tigp, 
   * and that individual members ca n't be permitted to attract companies by giving them exceptions to e.g. , environmental regulations . 
  * a company i know of has made a decision to relocate its datacentres from germany over the border to france because french energy costs are lower because they 're keeping nuclear while germany 's decided , for purely political reasons , to abandon it . 
  would you outlaw this difference too ? 
  hear , hear . 
  er ... we 're not in the schengen zone . 
  so his ` vision ' in that respect would be the status quo . 
  how terribly impossible . 
  in general , on the subject of this ' \u00e0 la carte ' ... why would nay nation sign an agreement that does n't benefit it ? 
  why would it negotiate a treaty it does n't want ? 
   * yes , it works . 
  * yup . 
  worked without the eu though , did n't it . 
   * i wonder why people support the tories * because labour were partly responsbiel for screwing up the economy ? 
  because the arrogant statist mentality of brown stuck in peoples ' throats ? 
   * i have a tory supporting friend who wants unemployment and housing benefit removed entirely . 
  * meaning : you have a friend who has a bizarre policy proposition : and he votes for a party that would n't dream of introducing that policy in a month of sundays ? 
  you 're being absurd and i really do n't know why . 
  europe is a geographic , cultural and historical entity , not the recent political and legal arrangement that is the eu . 
  to maintain otherwise demonstrates an arrogant and profoundly impoverished vision that is , i suppose , typical of the near-sighted , bureaucratic , uninspired grey functionaries who beaver away in brussels and strasbourg . 
   * because consumers would n't accept them as a class i product * that 's ok . 
  they need n't buy them . 
  the eu is not europe . 
   * so they are supposed to be curved , but ca n't be ridiculously curved * and why should n't they be ? 
   * the minimum standards there seem to be perfectly reasonable . 
  as far as i can see , curvature is only part of the marketing classification . 
  i personally think that 's a bit silly * sorry , but in the same breath you 've called the standards both reasonable and silly . 
  which ? 
  well he would say that , would n't he . 
  the mosque condemns for public consumption but has a long track record of encouraging homophobia : http://hurryupharry.org/2013/01/22/more-on-the-east-london-mosque-and-homophobia/, 
  just like iceland , eh ? 
  but you thought his reply worth an upvote ? 
  face it , you 're just a hypocrite . 
  you upvote sentiments you approve of and downvote those you do n't regardless of the quality of argument . 
  my justification will come in the next few decades when europe does n't become a federal state . 
  nope, 
  beautiful , if my recent trip to venice is anything to go by . 
  you people have such a gorgeous country there . 
   * irrelevantly small quanitities in some burgers ??? 
  * 30 % in the tesco ones . 
  the issue is n't really horsemeat , it 's what it tells you about their qa processes . 
  what else might be getting in ? 
  both , i think , do n't you ? 
   * is it just me , or is multiculturalism only spoken about in the negative ? 
  * it is just you . 
  multiculturalism has been the predominant model adopted by government agencies over the past 30-40 years . 
  did you miss it somehow ? 
   * i 've never said anything remotely racist or anti-semetic on here * you have . 
   * question for israelis , how do you live with yourselves ? 
  * now then , let 's analyse this . 
  is there some reason why , of all the countries in the world you might criticise , you decided to criticise israel ? 
  and did you mean * arab * israelis ? 
  or only the jewish ones . 
  all the jewish ones ? 
  and , speaking of disraeli :  * was a self-hating jew * just because he became a christian ? 
  this out of 15 comments . 
  you seem a tad preoccupied . 
  i 'm british . 
  i speak a bit of french , having once dated a girl from toulouse and worked for an anglo-french company in paris and brussels . 
  i speak a little german , a smattering of italian and spanish . 
  on the continent i 've visited france , andorra , spain , the netherlands , luxembourg , germany , denmark , sweden , estonia , austria , switzerland , italy , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary and croatia . 
  i 've visited over half the states of the us . 
  i 've never visited the far east , the indian subcontinent or africa . 
  you ? 
   * who made us world police ? 
  * well it 's a long and complicated answer , of course ; but the fact is , we are where we are . 
  we have the means to help support the government of mali in their struggle against islamist terrorism ; we 've been asked to assist . 
   * i 'm sure the `` brown people '' as you call them * i do n't know if you 're dim , or just posing as a dimwit - the former i suppose , seeing as you 're an antisemite and an swp supporter - but that was clearly used sardonically to talk about your apparent views . 
  mali 's under attack from islamist terrorists . 
  the uk 's a permanent member of the un security council and has been asked for help . 
  what do you think we should do ? 
  if you were from mali and did n't much fancy the idea of being governed by the african version of the taliban , would you think it was ' a joke ' ? 
  do you think only brown people should be expected to suffer ? 
  fascinating , thanks . 
   * it brainwash those poor young students to believe that there 's never ever been written a world famous play in their language * i think you must have had very bad teachers ; but to claim this is the general impression being given seems to me absurd . 
   * but not that good that even a turengjeti theater group in siberia should play hamlet for yakutian village and 8000 reindeers * why not ? 
  i went to see a 2,500 year-old greek play not so long ago . 
  why should n't a yakutian village see shakespeare .
