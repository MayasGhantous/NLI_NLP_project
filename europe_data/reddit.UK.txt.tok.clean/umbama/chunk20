  you know , some of the really famous playwrights and poets really are going to be better than nearly everyone else . 
  i think shakespeare has a fair claim to be considered . 
  i did n't ` freak out ' . 
  i simply relayed my experience that the croatians were the most unfriendly and cited this as an example of completely unnecessary rule-fetishism that made me conclude that . 
   * even if they do n't keep it i always leave it in the room * well that 's very interesting . 
  i always carry it with me . 
   * i 've never had anything stolen from my room . 
  * it would n't have been in my room . 
  it would have been in some functionary 's office , a functionary who enjoyed wearing his uniform a little too much . 
  british citizens are expressly told by our passport office that we should ** not ** let others keep our passports . 
  last week in venice our hotel took a quick photocopy as we were checking-in and handed them back straight away . 
  that 's the most i expect to happen . 
   * that is extremely common in many countries * i 'm british . 
  i 've been all round europe . 
  france , andorra , spain , the netherlands , luxembourg , germany , denmark , sweden , estonia , austria , switzerland , italy , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary , croatia . 
  croatia is ** the only place ** this has happened to me . 
  so , yes , thanks for your assertion that ` this is extremely common ' in many countries but in my experience you 're wrong . 
   * offer to pay in advance if you want your passport back , although i 'd be surprised if you were ever asked for it anyway * i did . 
  they were n't interested . 
  and as i say , they were rude . 
  it 's quite sad that in the week that saw the death of [ ** james m buchanan ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_m._buchanan ) you completely ignore the insight he provided : that of the self-interest of politicians . 
  a campsite demanding they * keep * my passport while it 's croatian * law * that i carry with me at all times some means of identification . 
  the plitvice lakes being fantastically overcrowded and everyone pushing along the paths . 
  surly waiters in restaurants . 
  unfriendly policemen . 
  that sort of stuff . 
  was n't like that elsewhere in eastern europe . 
  when i traveled around eastern europe a few years back i found the croatians to be the most * unfriendly * people i came across . 
  [ ed : so why have i been marked down for reporting what i found to be the case ? ], 
   * that `` brainwashes '' them to british culture and so on * er ... it introduces them the shakespeare . 
  shakespeare 's hardly any more contemporary british culture than corneille or dante . 
  and shakespeare is rather good , after all . 
  it 's not possible to read him completely naively but , really , give him a go and read him carefully . 
  it really is the most fantastic stuff . 
  i remember i started reading him closely when i produced a theatre poster for a university acting group who were doing hamlet and i trawled the text for memorable quotes i could use in the design . 
  i already knew by heart * that * soliloquy but i cam across so many more little , splendid gobbets . 
  one that stayed with me : * i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space , were in not that i have bad dreams ... * a king of infinite space . 
  how splendid . 
  shakespeare ` is a massacre ' of many native languages ? 
  are you mad ? 
   * someone 's hero is someone 's massacre * in the uk we 've had newton , dickens , shakespeare , adam smith . 
  what massacre ? 
   * socrates comes to mind , as a martyr and great thinker , who also embodies eu 's ideals * true ... he did n't believe in democracy either . 
   * since we ca n't have notes for every 27 countries * why ca n't we ? 
   * this clearly insinuates that you treat northern irish people as bigots until they prove to be an anomaly in your 'em pirical evidence ' . 
  * does n't do anything of the sort . 
  it was a sardonic reply to his claim he was from ni , as if i could deduce anything significant from that fact . 
  and in attempting to reply to my questions you 've proposed a scenario you do n't actually believe ? 
  and you make a claim that the generations of bigotry was just of a ` few ' ? 
  and you claim people are bringing up their kids now not to be bigoted . 
  where 's the evidence for these claims ? 
  look , let me ask you a few questions to get things straightened out here . 
  * do you think that years , generations , of sectarian politics and terrorism in ni might have added to deep-rooted prejudice and bigotry , more so than in other parts of the uk that have n't suffered such extremes ? 
  * do you think that the power of the churches in ni - both catholic and fundamentalist protestant - might contribute to bigotry more than in most other parts of the uk ? 
  if your answer to either or both of those questions is ` yes ' and you ca n't offer some mitigating factor that reduces significantly said bigotry then * it follows by simple logic * that a person plucked randomly from the ni population would be more likely to be a bigot than a person plucked randomly from the uk population as a whole . 
  yes ? 
  i see you have a logic problem too . 
  your analogy 's way off for a number of reasons , not the least of which are that i have n't said that most bigots are from ni , or indeed that most people in ni are bigots , or that i 'll act as if the poster is a bigot . 
  apart from that you 're spot on , aristotle . 
  fawlty towers is streets ahead of father ted . 
  except ... merlin was n't arthur 's ` faithful companion ' ... 
  ` eastenders ' . 
  then you 'll realise what a stinking hellhole britain 's becoming . 
  seems you ca n't read . 
  i did n't call anyone a bigot . 
  i said that the chances someone is a bigot , given the fact they are from ni , are higher than the chances they are a bigot , given the fact they are from most other places . 
  perhaps you could look up the meaning of the word irony , once you 've learned to read properly . 
  no , i have n't misunderstood what you said . 
  buck house was mentioned because - * gasp * - if even the queen 's residence does n't fly the flag all the time then how silly for any government building in ni to suggest it might . 
  but buck house * does * fly a flag every day - either the union flag or the royal standard - and would fly the union flag every day in a year were the queen not to visit . 
  there is no rule , protocol , whatever that the flag should * not * fly . 
  quite the contrary . 
  it is n't . 
  that 's what 'em pirical fact ' means . 
  or perhaps you think ni has fewer bigots than , say , devon . 
  the article states that the union flag flies whenever the queen 's not at buckingham palace , being replaced by the royal standard when she 's there . 
  if she did n't go there for a year the union flag would fly there for a year . 
  it 's not flown , not because it 's only flown on special days , which is the point of this idiot 's observation , but * because it 's replaced by the queen 's standard * . 
   * i live in northern ireland . 
  * so what ? 
  that simply increases the chance you 'll be a bigot . 
  [ ed : why am i getting downvoted for observing an empirical fact ? ], 
  the royal standard indicates the queen 's presence . 
  the union flag is used when she 's not there , the point is that one or the other is flown at all times . 
  if she did n't live in buck house for a year the union flag would be flown all year . 
   * we encourage everyone to follow this example , to champion the union flag and fly it daily as a symbol of national pride . 
  * http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/honours/7124.aspx it 's your sort of wilful stupidity that lends fuel to the fire . 
  acknowledge that ni is in a peculiar , delicate position ; do n't just pretend you do n't understand the situation elsewhere , then we can have a proper discussion . 
   * not even buckingham palace !, 
  * o rly ? 
   * a flag always flies above buckingham palace . 
  when the queen is in residence , the royal standard flies . 
  when the sovereign is not present , the union flag flies instead . 
  * http://www.royal.gov.uk/latestnewsanddiary/factfiles/40factsaboutbuckinghampalace.aspx the ` flag institute ' says :  * today all buildings ( including government buildings ) are encouraged to fly the union flag , where possible . 
  this has removed the need formally to define designated flag flying days *, 
   * there 's not really any political wing for cornish or welsh independence * plaid cymru advocates for an independent welsh state . 
  plaid has been in coalition government in wales . 
   * the less i get why britain is prepared to lose ( a lot of ) influence in the world due to the fright of being influenced/forced into doing things the uk does n't want . 
  * er ... because we 'd be forced to do things we do n't want to do ? 
  no , you would n't need to be ` rich ' to not notice this law .
