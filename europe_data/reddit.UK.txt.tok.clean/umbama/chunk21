  you 'd just not have to be poor . 
  the only people you 're addressing with it are poor people : not alcoholics , poor people . 
   * again , you seem to be missing the point of this law * well you can repeat that as much as you like . 
  you seem to fail to grasp the points that * the law would only affect poor people ( not , only * not * affect the rich , as you have mispresented it ) * alcohol consumption is falling , not rising * [ minimum pricing is probably illegal ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=celex:32002l0010:en:html ) * if there really is a cost to the rest of society from binge drinking then an increased price should fund the mitigation of that negative externality , through increased taxation i really , really think you should try to understand basic social policy and economics before you bother replying to explain why you want to hurt poor people . 
   * do you realistically believe a uk invasion of continental europe is even * what ? 
  the point is , dimwit , that other countries who need help will look to the uk . 
   * do n't flatter yourself . 
  english is completely useless outside of north america , western europe , and a handful of east-asian ex-colonies . 
  * unless you 're flying an aeroplane ... or publishing in scientific journals ... or a whole host of other purposes and reasons you 'd prefer were n't facts about the real world . 
   * setting a minimum price for alcohol wo n't increase alcohol manufacturers profits because people would buy less alcohol with the same amount of money * well , that 's the aim ; of course , you 're not tackling alcoholism ... you 're simply trying to tackle the heavy drinking of * poor * people only without tackling alcoholism amongst the better off * at all * , so let 's not pretend it 's about alcoholism . 
  but in any case , our concern is n't the profits of manufacturers . 
  if we want to increase prices as a deterrent then we can do it my insisting that manufacturers charge more ; or by increasing taxes . 
  in increasing taxes we raise revenue to cover some of the cost to the nhs of the damage done by alcohol . 
  i do n't think you 've thought about this . 
  why raise prices , if that 's what you want to do , by increasing the profits of the beer , wine and spirits manufacturers ? 
  why not increase the tax ? 
  no , no meaning that at all . 
  as the guy preparing the paper observed . 
  the massive rise in single parenthood is attributable to thatcher ? 
  which of her policies do you suppose it 's attributable to ? 
  how do you account for similar rises in other countries that did n't have thatcher ? 
   * no one of us europeans has the right to brag about the size of our respective militaries * not bragging . 
  pointing out that we need europe else we 'll just be a minor player is beside the point . 
   * and that is basically its only road to renewed global influence * fourth largest military expenditure ... permanent seat on un security council ... native language the world 's * lingua franca * . 
  yup . 
  no global influence there . 
  we 'd better make a pact with lichtenstein straight away . 
  and it 's the governments job to fix prices for everyone else ? 
  and not even by raising tax on alcohol ? 
  plain stupid . 
  so ... the people who were posting here claiming that depardieu was * treasonous * ... could we hear from them now please ? 
   * `` they never quoted the rest . 
  i went on to say : there are individual men and women , and there are families . 
  and no government can do anything except through people , and people must look to themselves first . 
  it 's our duty to look after ourselves and then to look after our neighbour . 
  my meaning , clear at the time but subsequently distorted beyond recognition , was that society was not an abstraction , separate from the men and women who composed it , but a living structure of individuals , families , neighbours and voluntary associations . `` * but keep on repeating the canard because you 're not able to engage with the facts , only with a caricatured enemy , * ` anarchisto ' *, 
   * her plans of disbanding `` society '' * ah yes ... that society that was disbanded ... 
   * i was horrified when i saw this paper . 
  i pointed out that it would almost certainly be leaked and * ** give a totally false impression ** ... * she demanded a more circumspect version * read what you will but do try to understand also . 
  yes , let 's bring back labour . 
  they were so careful with the economy were n't they . 
  er ... the plan was one of a number of options produced by a think tank and thatcher said she was horrified by it and that it was total nonsense . 
  it 's perfectly right and proper to encourage at least thinking about all achievable policy options when considering the long-term future of social policy . 
  a brit present in afghanistan at the invitation of the democratically elected government to help it defend itself against violent terrorists is killed : a violent terrorist who would like to reinstate through terror , threat , intimidation and murder a culture where women are denied education , judicial killings are carried out before crowds in football stadiums , music is banned and homosexuals are slaughtered and you do n't see a difference in kind between the two ? 
  you 're either lying as a posture or you 're so hopelessly stupid and morally bankrupt you might as well give up now . 
  safer than germany ? 
   * not a single indian will come to bonn * well , as indian women wo n't want to stay in india , where do you think * they 'll * be going ? 
  ` xenophpobia ' is just as inaccurate as ` racism ' . 
  but they do seem to have done it * in the name of their religion * and * because of their religion * and their understanding of their religion , which suggests the death penalty for apostates , does n't seem to be an unreasonable interpretation . 
  honestly , whatever you think of the opinion , how can you characterise it as ` xenophobic ' ? 
   * everyone is being asked to contribute * but not by the same amount , or even the same proportion . 
   * but are necessary for a year or 2 * well , that 's debated . 
  to argue the top rate of tax hollande has plumped for is * necessary * seems to be to be rather unreservedly and unwarrantedly convinced of the absolute inevitability of what is after all a contingent tax arrangement . 
  he simply disapproves of the punitive top-end tax rate and he 's moved * within the eu * - the eu i 'm sure hollande 's a great enthusiast for . 
  this is what happens if you introduce a punitive top-end tax rate . 
  perfectly predictable . 
  but , yes , i 'm glad you agree that ` treason ' is hyperbole . 
  as for hypocrisy : i do n't know . 
  i 'm not sure depardieu 's ever supported such a high top rate of tax and i 'm not sure you can make the case either that his previous good fortune which to some extent relied upon subsidies indicates his approval ; or that these or similar subsidies are absolutely dependent upon such high marginal tax rates . 
   * if you do n't accept the very principal of risk evaluation and weighed premiums * but i * do * . 
  of course i * do * . 
  but in this respect - where sex is a very crude proxy for something else , not the actual cause itself ; where many individuals of ones sex are actually less likely to have accidents than many members of the other sex ; where we have a long-standing wrong to right ; where the insurance companies wo n't be out of pocket ; where they already act in a regulatory framework that defines , constrains and curtails their ability to do * just anything * ; then i ca n't see what your objection is . 
  and a happy new year . 
  what an incoherent r reply ... no matter ' happy christmas, 
  no , look : given a mass of undifferentiated actuarial data you could chose to slice and dice it any number of ways . 
  left-handers , for example , have more accidents , i believe , perhaps because they live in an essentially right-handed world , perhaps because they have some minor brain impairment that made them left-handed in the first place ( it 's a theory of my gf 's old lecturer ) . 
  but what we 're saying here , as a society , is that * whatever * the aggregate fact about this particular way of slicing the dataset , it does n't tell you _ anything _ about an individual ; and that as the insurers themselves wo n't be out of pocket , it 's a cost that we , as a society , would prefer to bear together for the sake of not discriminating againt * everyone * of a particular sex . 
  seems perfectly reasonable to me . 
   * a democratically elected leader , with a law which has the support of a democratically elected parliament is in his rights to apply it . 
  * and a french citizen has the right to leave the country . 
   * and all those who participated in the democratic process are obliged to listen to it . 
  * he did listen . 
  that 's why he left . 
  ok : if your elected politicians decide . 
  either way , it 's the law so your claim that ` this is how insurance works ' is demonstrably false . 
  who do you think passed all the laws under which insurance works , anyhow ? 
  i 'm sure he 's quaking in his boots . 
   * ` his fair share back ' * he does n't approve of your new president 's new tax regime and so has left . 
   * paying taxes is like being called to serve in the military , or any other rational national service * no of course it is n't and the fact you 've had to have recourse to hyperbole demonstrates how rubbish is your argument . 
  how is that treason ? 
  what sort of state would you like to live in , where free movement out of the state is * verboten * . 
  oh this is nonsense . 
   * breaking the spirit of taxation * read this :  * yes , it is true that amazon pays a lower rate of corporation tax by basing itself in luxembourg , and google and facebook in ireland . 
  but doing this is not a sign of corporate chicanery or crafty lawyers exploiting loopholes ; rather it is the very point of the single market ( articles 26 , 28 , 49 , 54 and 56 of the basic european union treaty ) . 
  a company that wants to sell to all 27 eu countries needs to have its european headquarters in only one eu state . 
  vat is charged ( except , oddly , on digital goods ) where the delivery is made to , and corporation tax is levied on where that single brass plate is . 
  as hmrc has recently pointed out , this is not avoidance , this is just the way corporation tax works . 
  *  * it is true that amazon has warehouses in the uk but we also have a double taxation treaty with luxembourg -- as we have with many other countries -- which states that tax is not chargeable on the profits made from sales from warehouses and logistics chains . 
  *  * it is true that starbucks pays royalties to a dutch company , thus apparently dodging uk tax . 
  but eu law ( council directive 2003/49/ec ) states that such royalty payments within the eu are not only allowed -- it forbids the taxation of the payments in the country sending them . 
  *  * these companies are not making a mockery of our tax laws : they are obeying the rules and regulations in each and every particular . 
  they are not even avoiding tax , as these companies are doing specifically what the law intends , even to the point that we have laws that forbid national governments from stopping these multinationals doing what they have been doing * now : who are you to discern the ` true ' spirit of the matter , when it 's contrary to the letter of the law and to the uk tax authority 's explicit statement that this does n't constitute even tax avoidance ? 
  find another bandwagon . 
  this one 's not going anywhere . 
   * it an be argued that the man has betrayed his community * it can be argued that hollande betrayed * him * . 
  ` treasonous ' ? 
  for exercising his perfectly legal right to live where he likes in the eu ? 
  as it 's now illegal , that 's obviously * not * how insurance works . 
  insurance operates within a regulatory framework and if we decide it 's in the interests of equity to adjust that framework then we can do that and have done it . 
  i 'm arguing for the rationale for it here : you seem not to have noticed it 's a fait accompli and you 're living in the past .
