   * obviously there 's something about the male upbringing that disposes them to higher rates of costly accidents . 
  that or it 's biological . 
  either way , insurance is about chance , and if you 're in the bracket that has a higher chance of requiring an insurance payout , your premiums should be higher . 
  * but whatever that risk is it 's only an aggregate group risk and in fact i may belong to other groups that lower my risk and i might be an outlier in this group ; but because you 've decided to consider the fact i 'm male you lump me in with a group that as a whole , on aggregate , has a higher risk but a higher risk my own driving does n't contribute to . 
  i 'm therefore penalised not because of my own driving but just because you have decided to slice the data by sex . 
  but they 're judging risk by considering * not * a group of people who are more risky - bad drivers - but people who happen to be female . 
  not * all * women are less likely to have an accident than * all * men but because an individual woman is a member of a group that * as a group * has less expensive accidents then she wins ; and a man , no matter how much a better driver he may be as an individual , he must bear the additional cost because of his chromosomes ? 
   * it literally means power bestowed by the people . 
  african tribes wherein power was based solely on seniority were inherently democratic since the people all believed in the system ... as long as the people had given the power to the leaders through blinded belief in the system it would still be a democracy . 
  * well , * literally * it certainly does n't mean that . 
  literally it does not mean ` rule by \u00e0 system * believed * in by the people ' : it means , ` rule * by the people * ' so your example would not be a democracy in any classical sense and it would n't be one in any contemporary sense either . 
  i 'm sure you said you had other important things to do ... probably tied in with your pressing scholarly engagements ... you know , the sort of scholarship where in the face of ample contrary evidence and many citations you provide not a single link to support your ... er ... expertise . 
  something about frying fish , was n't it ? 
  some scholarly plaice you had to go to ? 
  off you go . 
  btw . 
  what do you think literature is a ` genre ' * of * ? 
  and what do you think scholarship is a ` genre ' * of * ? 
  you actually said it was poor or lazy grammar . 
  you 're just wrong . 
   * i have larger fish to fry * well go and fry them them you pompous ass instead of wasting your precious time here with me . 
  neither scholarship nor literature are ` genres ' . 
  and your claim was that it was poor or lazy grammar . 
  it 's neither . 
  and i do n't care if you ` consider ' ... not my argument but rather the facts , either openly or in some weird closed manner , by way of peculiar contrast . 
   * it 's poor grammar or lazy grammar * no it is n't . 
   * some people object to the use of plural pronouns in this type of situation on the grounds that it 's ungrammatical . 
  in fact , the use of plural pronouns to refer back to a singular subject is n't new : it represents a revival of a practice dating from the 16th century . 
  it 's increasingly common in current english and is now widely accepted both in speech and in writing . 
  * http://oxforddictionaries.com/words/he-or-she-versus-they seems like your ` scholarship ' is a bit crap . 
  here 's a list of authors who have used it in this way :  * jane austen , geoffrey chaucer , edmund spenser , william shakespeare , the king james bible , the spectator , jonathan swift , daniel defoe , frances sheridan , oliver goldsmith , henry fielding , maria edgeworth , percy shelley , lord byron , william makepeace thackeray , sir walter scott , george eliot [ mary anne evans ] , charles dickens , mrs. gaskell , anthony trollope , john ruskin , robert louis stevenson , walt whitman , george bernard shaw , lewis carroll , oscar wilde , rudyard kipling , h. g. wells , f. scott fitzgerald , edith wharton , w. h. auden , lord dunsany , george orwell , and c. s.

  * http://oxforddictionaries.com/words/he-or-she-versus-they what a scholar you are ... 
  english is my first language too , sonny , and you 're no scholar . 
   * none of the authors you mentioned are modern * are you really trying to suggest no modern author has used ` they ' in this way ? 
  are you really trying to suggest you use english better than auden ? 
  really no scholar at all , are you . 
   * grammar is not worth being `` bloody pompous '' about * ... and yet it was you who wrote : ' * but please avoid it in written communication * ' ... 
  here 's a bigger list for you : jane austen , geoffrey chaucer , edmund spenser , william shakespeare , the king james bible , the spectator , jonathan swift , daniel defoe , frances sheridan , oliver goldsmith , henry fielding , maria edgeworth , percy shelley , lord byron , william makepeace thackeray , sir walter scott , george eliot [ mary anne evans ] , charles dickens , mrs. gaskell , anthony trollope , john ruskin , robert louis stevenson , walt whitman , george bernard shaw , lewis carroll , oscar wilde , rudyard kipling , h. g. wells , f. scott fitzgerald , edith wharton , w. h. auden , lord dunsany , george orwell , and c. s. lewis . 
   * but please avoid it in written communication * so hoity-toity . 
  when the usage is found in chaucer , auden , shakespeare , byron , thackeray , dickens , eliot and jane austen i really would n't be so bloody pompous if i were you . 
   * is `` they '' the future of generic pronouns ? 
  *  * i will state for the record that i am a firm believer that someday `` they '' will be the acceptable choice for this situation . 
  english currently lacks a word that fits the bill , and many people are already either mistakenly or purposely using `` they '' as a singular generic personal pronoun ; so it seems logical that rules will eventually move in that direction . 
  * http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/he-they-generic-personal-pronoun.aspx  * i am flummoxed by the controversy over it and by the resistance of many people to accept it . 
  singular they has long been used in literature and in conversation , and though it still has an informal taint , it seems to me absurd to resist adopting it when it satisfies an aching need . 
  * http://www.dailywritingtips.com/is-%e2%80%9cthey%e2%80%9d-acceptable-as-a-singular-pronoun/  * the new fowler 's modern english usage , has written that it 's only a matter of time before this practice becomes standard english : `` the process now seems irreversible . '' merriam-webster 's collegiate dictionary ( 11th ed . ), 
  already finds the singular they acceptable `` even in literary and formal contexts , '' * http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/magazine/26fob-onlanguage-t.html?_r=0, 
   * ` they ' is unfortunately common * not ` unfortunately ' . 
  language changes , this is a change . 
   * but is absolutely not grammatically correct , and i 'd cringe to see it in writing * then you 're wrong . 
  language changes , this solves a problem . 
  in english it 's common to use ` they ' . 
  although it does n't agree with the subject , it 's so common that i think it 's fair enough to say the language has changed to find a solution , and this is the solution . 
   * human cultures are converging * so what 's the need to yoke everyone together in some artificial federation ? 
  if they are converging , there 's no point . 
  if they are n't , it wo n't work . 
  ` waste your time ' including continually calling me a troll and downvoting me ? 
  you get what you deserve , matey . 
   * you find the idea of the ever closer union in the europe declaration and the schuman declaration , years before the uk joined * and you 'll find the schuman declaration , though in retrospect considered as documenting certain founding principles and aims of the eu , does n't actually prefigure the eu , or the european parliament , or a common currency , or much of the loss of sovereignty now being called for . 
   * the reason the uk did n't want to join * again , do you mean here : a select bunch of politicians and civil servants ? 
  or do you mean , the majority of people in the uk ? 
  i know , as a staunch european , certain democratic notions may escape you - but it 's best to be clear . 
   * the idea of the eu union is one of an ever closer union * it may be ; but the british people have never voted to enter the eu . 
  what 's the comprehension problem ? 
  the british did n't vote to enter the eu . 
  they voted to enter the eec . 
   * if the british population did n't understand the true nature of the eec * i think they did . 
  they did n't foresee the maastricht treaty that turned the eec into the eu . 
  they did n't foresee the lisbon treaty . 
  you think they should have foreseen all that , do you ? 
  and should have made their referendum decision about the eec on the basis of some precognitive stab at a future you think they should have grasped perfectly ? 
  right . 
  you were joining in the thread where someone else said it and i was responding to that , . 
  yes you did . 
  you claimed that the telegraph 's remark was wishful thinking . 
  yes , there was a debate - about joining the eec ( clue for you : it was n't until the maastricht treaty that it became the ec ) . 
  that does n't address the question . 
  are you now claiming that a large majority of the british public in 1973 understood the eec would become the eu with ongoing pressure for further political and financial integration , and approved of it ? 
  you claimed it was wishful thinking . 
  the ** fact ** is that it was n't that , or was n't only that , whatever you think of all online polls . 
   * the uk was aware that the eu/ec was way more then just a trading block * when you say , ` the uk was aware ' , whom do you mean ? 
  some politicians ? 
  the entirety of the british population ? 
  you seem to be suggesting that the uk 's participation in efta somehow indicated an interest in something other than ` just a trading block ' . 
  the ** free trade ** agreement ? 
  the british are europeans ... 
  not wishful thinking at all :  * an online poll conducted by the popular le parisien tabloid showed almost 70 per cent supporting the country 's wayward son and poster boy for glorious political incorrectness . 
  bollocks, 
  he has the option he 's exercising . 
  he 's french through and through , he loves france , the food and the wine and the women by all accounts ; i do n't believe swearing fealty to hollande is a necessary condition of wanting to remain french . 
  hollande and his policies are n't the alpha and omega of loyal , honest french citizens . 
  no , he may be of the view that france would be more successful if it did n't attempt to impose quite punitive marginal tax rates on the very wealthy . 
  it may be true , may not be , but it is n't hypocritical . 
  but why is that hypocritical ? 
  i do n't suppose he 's ever said he 's in favour of significantly higher taxes on himself . 
  you 're in the eu and have signed up to the schengen agreement . 
  where exactly is the hypocrisy ?
