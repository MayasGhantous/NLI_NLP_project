  it 's just that the police themselves are blaming lack of resources . 
  rather than , you know , your made-up excuse . 
  it is n't a question of that . 
  it 's understanding that many people come from cultures that do n't value women and subscribe to a version of islam that actively subjugates them and denigrates non-muslim women . 
  disperse the crowd , just as they had already done earlier in the evening, 
   * it was only when victims got home and complained * none complained there and then ? 
  and also according to the uk c4 news i 've just watch the russian plane was in turkish space for just seconds . 
  did n't say it was . 
  i said hezbollah is anti-semitic . 
  you 're the one bringing anti-zionism into it . 
   * they are n't antisemitic , they 're anti-zionist * ok , let 's leave it there . 
  also for anyone else to see . 
  you seem to think that to determine whether the antisemitic terrorists hezbollah is in fact moderate you have to talk about the us . 
  why is that ? 
  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/moderate would that be the moderate form of antisemitism , btw ? 
  the moderate form that includes an avowed intention to destroy israel ? 
  the united states , france , the gulf cooperation council , australia , canada , the netherlands , and israel have classified hezbollah as a terrorist organization . 
  the european union , new zealand and the united kingdom have proscribed hezbollah 's military wing . 
  france and germany released statements that they will join other european countries in calling for a eu-blacklisting of hezbollah as a terror group hezbollah is committed to the elimination of the state of israel . 
  it engages in holocaust denial . 
  it conducts terrorism and , notably , suicide bombings . 
  they torture and execute civilians . 
  they are * anti- * sectarian . 
  so , tell me : in what world would this jolly lot be * moderate * ? 
  do words mean anything to you ? 
  hezbollah is n't moderate . 
  we did . 
  and most - far and away the most - killings were muslim on muslim . 
  i take it you do n't care for facts ? 
   * which is not a problem with islam * er ... 
  ottomans feature in this at all ? 
   * the kid that saw his unarmed parents to get killed in iraq * would most likely have seen his parents get killed by other muslims , in fact . 
  oh yeah , let 's not mention the ottomans . 
  that 'd disturb your narrative . 
  but sometimes you * do * have to kill people for peace do n't you . 
  it is n't the oxymoron you appear to suppose it is . 
  yes, 
  who hates ` everything un-british ' ? 
  and i 'm not entirely sure why you 're introducing expats now ... 
   * our society created these people * in what way ? 
   * i 'm obviously far from an authority on irish politics * ai n't that the truth, 
  the were both murdered by leftist republican groups - the inla and the ira . 
  in what way were n't these left ? 
  oh hold on , i know . 
  in the sense it that it is inconvenient for you right now to acknowledge it . 
  so what ? 
  so ... eu trade tariffs that damage the economies of developing countries , and immigration polices that allow free movement of mostly white , relatively wealthy eu citizens while putting up barriers to mostly non-white relatively poor people from elsewhere are n't at all xenophobic , not to say racist ? 
  what a topsy-turvey world you inhabit . 
  islamism and the ira both espouse ( d ) extreme violence as a means . 
  the #brexit campaign does n't . 
  do you see the difference ? 
  [ ed : hmmm ... marked down . 
  wonder why ... ]  * forces them to fight an asymmetrical struggle * what forces them to declare lions and rotarians to be wings of an international zionist conspiracy ? 
  women ca n't be terrorists ? 
  who knew ... 
  if only we could do away with the people altogether . 
  then these decent people could just get on with doing the right thing . 
  actually , you said it 's not well-run * because * the population are not properly engaged with the issues . 
  thanks goodness we 're in fact blessed with such knowledgeable , capable , disinterested , humble , selfless public servants . 
   * government is not particularly well run , because the population are not properly engaged with the issues * ah , it 's * our * fault . 
  perhaps the government should vote us out and elect a new population . 
  solid democracy , 6th largest economy in the world , speaking natively the * lingua franca * of international business , science & technology , 3rd largest military power , nuclear power , member of nato , permanent un security council member , huge cultural influence . 
  yeah . 
  eu does n't need britain at all . 
   * the parliament can ask the commission to present legislative proposals * as i said . 
  the elected parliament can not propose legislation . 
  i suggest you stop trying to hide the facts of the matter . 
   * because it greatly facilitates trade between the countries . 
  * how ? 
   * it also increases tourist income * how ? 
  i was in rome last december , i 'll be in venice this new year . 
  i would n't * not do * just because of the euro , just like i did n't * not go * to the netherlands , germany and france before the euro . 
   * the eu is just as accountable as the uk government * nonsense . 
  for a start , the directly elected parliament ca n't propose legislation . 
  how is that ` just as accountable ' ? 
   * the idea of having a shared currency for a close group of countries/economies is theoretically a good idea * firstly , why ? 
  secondly , you 've already said * there is no point * unless you share fiscal decisions . 
  not ` less effective but still some point ' but ** no point ** . 
  your words . 
   * that 's a poor argument * what argument ? 
   * there 's no way to know what would have happened had the euro not been adopted * right ... it could have been worse ... somehow ...  * if you do n't also share fiscal decisions * you mean impose them from some unaccountable centralised body ? 
   * there 's no point having a shared currency if you do n't also share fiscal decisions . 
  unfortunately , you ca n't do that when the economies of the various nations are so drastically different * so why was the euro such a good idea then ? 
   * and probably should have just switched to the euro with everyone else * how 's that working out for you guys ? 
  clearer than 44 % . 
  but hey , let 's do that . 
   * it almost flooded the internet with articles about the potential greek exit from the $ zone * and in this remark by you hangs a large amount of the problem . 
  you simply presume that it is the case , and that everyone agrees with you that it is the case , that a greek exit from the euro is synonymous with being anti-europe . 
  it is n't . 
  yes but you said :  * thing is , even in america you could have a joke about an irishman , an italian and a jew walking into - say , a diner - and it would be implied that all of them are american by citizenship / nationality * by way of an analogy with the original here . 
  but it would n't be an analogy , precisely because it was n't repeating the same howler . 
   * putting a catholic in the joke implies that jewishness is only a religion , and it 's not , it 's also an ethnicity/culture . 
  there are secular jews . 
  so i do n't think that comparison works . 
  * on the contrary it works quite well . 
  not perfect of course ; but - for example - many americans were concerned about the prospect of a catholic president because they feared his loyalties would lie elsewhere . 
   * thing is , even in america you could have a joke about an irishman , an italian and a jew walking into - say , a diner - and it would be implied that all of them are american by citizenship / nationality * yes but here we 're faced with the following : an * american * , a jew and a. ... i think it 's you who 's missing the point . 
   * you are talking about people that are insane * you have no evidence he or his family are insane . 
  i think you have to accept that people can behave like this without being insane . 
  that 's all the more chilling .
