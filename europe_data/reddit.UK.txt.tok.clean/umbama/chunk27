  i 'm not being pc . 
  it does n't ` fit the joke ' unless the premise makes sense ; even as a joke it must have some coherence to its premise . 
  you 've inverted the problem to point out that jews may have an extra-national identity . 
  that nevertheless would n't make them * not czech * . 
   * czech republic is nation-state . 
  dividing people by ethnicity is appropriate in this context * as i said . 
  you 're a bit thick . 
  then you make my point for me . 
  thank you . 
  you have an ethnic concept of nationality that has no place in the modern world . 
  incidentally , madeline albright 's parents were jewish . 
  you 're really rather dim , are n't you . 
  i 've been to most european countries ( i 'm from the uk ) , both eastern and western , and - not knowing how long you have over here and how much money you have - i 'd have to say : italy . 
  first , let 's get the people thing out the way . 
  they can be a bit loud and obsessed with how they look but they 're perfectly friendly if you give them a chance . 
  but the country and the towns are just * gorgeous * . 
  the food is excellent . 
  the coffee is so good makes me want to cry back here in england . 
  most parts of europe have * something * to recommend them but italy just has more , in more concentration . 
  from the earliest greek , roman and etruscan settlements , though the height of the roman republic and empire , to christian italy and the renaissance ... you have more than 2,000 years ' worth of the most spectacular art and architecture . 
  i 'd recommend the northern region of emilio romagna and nearby . 
  take in florence , siena , modena , bologna and ravenna . 
  verona and venice if possible , rome if you can afford the time to go further south . 
  italy , i think , is the one absolutely must-see country in europe . 
  actually , if you 're visiting spain , you could go down south and see granadaa and cordoba . 
  jews born and raised in the czech republic are not czech ? 
  it gives you a grin if you 're not brought up sharp by the peculiar distinction between a czech person and a jewish person . 
  i would n't say , * ' a frenchman , and italian , a german and a catholic walked into a bar ' * . 
  it just sounds weird . 
  the reason this does n't sound weird to you , i presume , is because you 're unfazed by the antisemitism . 
   * czechs are generally super postive to jews * you 've done it again . 
  * czech jews * ** are ** * czech * you do n't have on the left hand , over here , all the czech people , who are ` super positive ' ; and over there , on the right hand , all the jews to whom they are super positive . 
  the czech jews ** are ** czech . 
  they 're over there on the left-hand side too . 
   * i thought that brits have a tradition in politically incorrect jokes * the point of your joke was n't to repeat a daringly antisemitic trope in the cause of comedy . 
  you colluded with a definition of jews as ` other ' , as non-czech . 
  i understand it 's supposed to be a joke . 
  a metajoke , a joke playing with the traditional form of the joke . 
  * an englishman , and irishman and a scotsman ... * but even still it relies for its coherence on the insistence that a jew is not a czech . 
  why do you not describe fischer as czech ? 
  you call zeman czech . 
  why not fisher ? 
  why his his jewishness the most salient thing ? 
  no ... do n't tell me . 
  his father , you know , was a holocaust survivor and you still ca n't see beyond the fact he 's jewish . 
  well , the second paragraph was about a report by action aid . 
  you did n't mention if you had read that report ( do you know , i suspect you have n't ) or whether you agreed with it . 
   * if you want a more specific one , here you go . 
  apple , by `` constructing complex global structures that allow them to move money through offshore havens '' managed to reduce their overseas ( non-us ) tax liability to 1.9 % ( from 24 % ish ) * that 's it is it ? 
  well , let me introduce you - for it most certainly will be an introduction - to the [ hmrc 's recent briefing on this very topic ( pdf ) ] ( http://www.hmrc-corporatecommunications.co.uk/assets/c/b/1/1/6b773c2e747ec4e956611d84199a5076d27390623063721414/hmrc%20issue%20briefing%20-%20taxing%20the%20profits%20of%20multinational%20businesses.pdf )  * non-resident trading companies which do not have a branch in the uk , but have uk customers , will therefore pay tax on the profits arising from those customers in the country where the company is resident , according to the tax law in that country . 
  the profits will not be taxed in the uk . 
  * ** this is not tax avoidance : it is simply the way that corporation tax works . 
  **  * most major economies operate corporation tax in the same way as the uk , so uk-resident companies are treated in a similar way in other countries . 
  in other words , uk companies do not pay corporation tax to another country on the profits from sales in that country , unless they trade through a branch based there . 
  instead , they pay corporation tax in the uk *, 
   * i do expect to be taken fairly seriously * mmmm . 
  pompous too . 
   * you honed in directly on the one paragraph that was n't relevant . 
  * i honed in on the one about the uk . 
  if you recall i asked * you * for an example and you simply gave me a link to wikipedia ... almost as if you did n't have an example ... * legal entities - applies to individuals , not companies , in the main . 
  * legal vagueness - well , draft your laws better . 
  you call it vagueness and claim that the spirit of the law is n't being adhered to : i claim that you ca n't discern the motives of the legislators , you 're not in telepathic contact , and it 's down to the tax authorities and the courts to interpret the law . 
  and we 've established , we are n't talking about illegality here . 
  do you want companies to abide by the law as defined by the courts ; or by what you claim you can discern by mysterious means to have been the legislators ' intent ? 
  * tax shelters - may or may not be abusive ; some are shelters by deliberate design . 
  hmri already cracks down on abusive ones . 
  * so you 're left only with moving offshore . 
  got an example of the last one you think is immoral ? 
  ok : so your position is that anyone taking advantage of duty free when on holiday is acting immorally . 
  and you expect to be taken seriously ? 
  3rd point , no , i 'm not being facetious ... perhaps you did n't actually read the wikipedia article you used in place of actually providing an example . 
  perhaps you could provide me with a specific example ... other than availing oneself of duty free ... 
   * and there may be situations where it is in a company 's best interests to break the law . 
  * you 're becoming confused . 
  we are n't for the moment talking about illegality . 
  we 're talking about companies fully compliant with the law . 
   * if they are choosing to do something specifically to reduce their tax liability ( whether legally or not ) , then yes ; as far as i am concerned they are doing something morally wrong . 
  * really ? 
  so does this hold for individuals too ? 
  everybody who buys duty-free , for example ? 
   * if you 're interested in dodgy methods for avoiding tax , wikipedia has a good introduction * i 'm in the uk . 
  the wikipedia article seems to be talking about window tax . 
  could you perhaps give me a specific example that * you * think is wrong ? 
  ` morally ' ? 
  a company 's directors have a legal and moral obligation to comply with the law . 
   * however , i was specifically referring to the money `` lost '' through companies and individuals using particular methods and structures specifically for avoiding or reducing their tax burden * er ... so if a company pays what it is legally obliged to pay by the laws created by the politicians you vote into office , they ; 're doing something wrong ? 
  so , tell me , what are these dodgy methods you 're talking about ? 
   * the cost to the uk of legal tax evasion ... is something like 100 times the cost of this proposed increase to the uk * you mean : the amount of money not being paid , legitimately , by companies fully compliant with the law ? 
  well , surely , the amount of money * not * being paid , legitimately , is their total net profit ? 
  so ... when we 're cutting almost everything else because of our massive debt , why should the eu not be considered ? 
  regardless of the percentage , in such trying economic times why should subventions to the eu be raised ? 
  indeed . 
   * they glorify hitler/the raf * wut ? 
   * t is religious shit . 
  the problem is not their muslimness , the problem is their religiosity . 
  many religious muslims of today are not much different from the christians of 500 years ago * and we are living ... * when * ? 
  no do n't tell me , let me guess ... i do n't * think * it 's 500 years ago . 
  today !, 
  it 's * today * is n't it ? 
  er ... paying tax where the company 's incorporated is a deliberate rule deliberately introduced by the eu .
