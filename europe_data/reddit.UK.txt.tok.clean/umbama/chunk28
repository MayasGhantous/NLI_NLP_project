  deliberately . 
   * hope that your government will cease practicing the policy of collective punishment which was applied on a mass scale by hitler and his armies * what a complete tosspot . 
   * by and large your islamic population consists of educated professionals * that 's not true . . 
   * the nobel prize for peace for the eu has been long overdue * what has the eu done for peace ? 
   * it seems , that some part of the populations has a huge issue with being called `` just '' a parent ( oh , my ) . 
  ok , noted * yes . 
  many people who * are * mothers and fathers and who already are called ` mothers ' and ` fathers ' would like to continue being called ` mothers ' and ` fathers ' . 
  your supercilious attitude noted . 
   * the price should go the two superpowers of the cold war who kept peace in europe * you think the soviet union preserved peace ? 
   * it has strengthened the relations between the european member states * without the eu , since 1992 , do you think france might have gone to war with spain ? 
   * i would also assume they do n't mean just the current union * you 'd assume they mean something they did n't say ... * why * ? 
  this was a peace prize . 
  not a stability prize . 
  since its inception , 20 years ago , what has it done in the way of preserving peace ? 
  you 're drawing a parallel between the two ; in the absence of a compelling reason why people 's wishes should n't be accommodated it would be usual to accommodate them . 
  so the moral argument against allowing a mother and a father to be described as a mother and a father on an official document is similar to the moral argument against capital punishment ? 
  i think you lose . 
  and you 're very silly too . 
  it 's no more exclusive than the * facts of the matter * are exclusive . 
   * there 's no reason to cling on to a tradition * yes there is . 
  people want it . 
  did you miss that part ? 
   * what is your magical solution that imposes no appellation on anyone * allowing them to choose their own appellation . 
  no imposition . 
  thinking . 
  like magic , is n't it ? 
  you should try it . 
   * heterosexual couples can still define themselves as `` mother '' and `` father '' * they do n't need to ` define themselves ' as mother and father - what a peculiar convolution of language you have to adopt . 
  they * are * mother and father . 
  the question here is , why not continue to be allowed to declare that on official forms . 
  i still do n't see why not . 
   * as a genderqueer gay ( biological ) male , i prefer `` parent '' . 
  * fine , that 's your preference . 
  i 'm not sure why you think your preference must be imposed on others . 
   * the easiest solution there is to just have it say `` parent '' . 
  * i love this ` easiest ' . 
  easiest for whom ? 
  for you , who , in your genderqueerness , wants to call yourself a ` parent ' it 's easy . 
  for the mother and father who 'd like to call themselves ` mother ' and ` father , not easy . 
  why do you get to impose your preferred appellation on them ? 
   * if the birth certificates are n't accurate * there 's no dispute about accuracy . 
  just your fascistic desire to impose your preference on others . 
  and some would like to carry on doing what they 've done in the past . 
  say that they 're mother and father . 
  what would be * wrong * with that ? 
  not at all . 
  i 'm not telling anyone to do anything - and by the way , you 're dishonest , you understand perfectly what i 've said . 
   * lots more effort for all parties with no benefit . 
  * well let 's give them the choice and see if you 're correct , shall we ? 
  so now you have to pretend that your concern for people 's ease trumps their expressed desire to fill out a form declaring them to be what they are ? 
   * from a legal standpoint it is a proper solution . 
  * this is just an * assertion * by you . 
  there 's absolutely no need to * stop * heterosexual couples declaring themselves ` mother ' and ` father ' except for weird misguided notion that if they were allowed to describe themselves that way then gay parents would somehow be * less * . 
  so you prevent that by making a pretence in legally recognised official forms . 
  why ? 
   * i did not use myopic as an insult * you do n't speak english very well , do you . 
  you can call my view myopic if you like , i 'm completely indifferent to your insults ; i 'm just looking at facts . 
   * it was an expansion * i do n't know what you mean by ` an expansion ' . 
  are you meaning to say that all the provisions of the maastricht treaty were ` an expansion ' ? 
  what expanded ? 
   * he eu can legitimately be seen as the original european coal and steel community that has gone through a number of face lifts * oh nonsense . 
   * and then gone to war again a decade later * which they did n't do , despite the eu not existing until the maastricht treaty in 1992 . 
  this is a defence of the vitally peaceful role of the eu ... how , exactly ? 
   * read my entire sentences please * why , to point out to you more poor wording that you get uppity about before you realise your mistake ? 
   * so ibm is a different company now than its inception back in the 1800s * 1911 , actually . 
  in many respects , yes : it has different staff , a different management team , and sells completely different products . 
  so if i were to claim ibm has been selling computer services for 100 years i 'd just be * wrong * . 
  but there 's more to it than that : the eu was constituted by the masstricht treaty and it simply did n't exist before then . 
  it was n't just a * renaming * . 
  er ... no ... it was * your * suggestion that * ` europe could just as easily have withdrawn from the war ' * that had me there . 
  in what way could europe have withdrawn from the war , do you think ? 
   * it is different * i know . 
  i just said that . 
   * to claim that the eu is a different entity because it expanded is nonsensical * lucky i did n't say that then , eh ? 
   * and merged into the eu * the eu is a very different institution to the eec/ec . 
  you 're just * pretending * is 's the same thing through time and it * is n't * . 
  why ? 
   * the coal and steel union etc. 
  are all part of a buildup * only if you think very teleologically about history . 
  there as nothing inevitable or necessary about maastricht . 
   * europe could just as easilly have withdrawn from the war * what ? 
  what war ? 
   * ... is the culmination of decades of very specific work ... * utter crap . 
  you have a very mechanistic view of history , do n't you . 
   * it took away the incentives for further war * many , many things have made large-scale mainland european war unlikely . 
  the eu , having been in existence for 20 years , is the least of them . 
  try living in wales , where all official forms are in two languages even though everyone * can * speak english . 
   * if you allow gay couples to adopt ( and there is really no reason not to ) , you need to adapt legal documents accordingly . 
  * for the gay couples . 
  why do you need to adapt if for the heterosexual couples ? 
   * the eu wasnt founded with the signing of a paper in 1993 * as a matter of fact , it was . 
  you can count all of history as the ` build-up ' . 
  and before then , when we had the eec , do you really think france was going to go to war with germany ? 
  but the award was to the eu . 
  and of course economic cooperation and trade agreements have contributed to lasting peace - as has the internet , common pop music culture , hollywood films and cheap international travel . 
  you ca n't defend the award to the eu by laying claim to everything * before * the eu . 
  if the maastricht treaty had never been signed and we 'd carried on with the eec , do you think merkel would have invaded poland ? 
  from 1945 to 1992 ... what was the problem ? 
  the eu 's been in existence for 20 years . 
   * basically , europe 's been almost permanently at war before the eu .
