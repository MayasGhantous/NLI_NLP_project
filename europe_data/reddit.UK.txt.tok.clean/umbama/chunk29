  * before 1992 ? 
  well , it was founded by the maastricht treaty just 20 years ago . 
  you 'll have to remind me about the discussion about maintaining peace . 
  and how did the eu prevent world wars ? 
  given that it was created only 20 years ago . 
  well given that the eu did n't exist until 20 years ago , it might have been difficult . 
   * he eu started as an economic union to give space for peaceful trade negotiations between france and germany especially over iron and coal in the rhineland . 
  * the eu was created by the treaty of maastricht 20 years ago . 
  there were formal trade arrangements between member states long before . 
  there was the european economic community . 
  there was the european coal and steel community i see you 're going down the north korean path of rewriting history ...  * catalan , northern ireland etc * what ? 
  the ni settlement was brokered by blair , clinton and george mitchell . 
  one englishman and two americans . 
  what did the eu have to do with it ? 
   * the un would probably not have survived without it * given that the un survived right up to the maastricht treaty 20 years ago when the eu came into being i 'm not sure i follow you ...  * the eu is up there with the first athenian experiments with democracy * women could n't vote ... slaves could n't vote ... i see what you mean . 
   * to remind people of the contribution it 's made in the past decades * go on then . 
  remind me . 
  do you really think that if people were educated about the byzantine , undemocratic and corrupt eu they 'd welcome it more ? 
   * should be a huge red flag for any society wanting to maintain a democracy * i completely agree with that . 
  there seems to have been a problem with predatory males in powerful positions in the entertainment industry , yes . 
  fortunately we seem to have moved on . 
  what was your point , again ? 
  in all those figures you 've demonstrated that the weird extremists are actually in the minority . 
  do n't suggest i did n't read your reply properly simply because i disagree with you . 
  i 've responded to your remark about promotion elsewhere . 
   * muslims have a higher percentage than the average . 
  however , so does poor people , males , foreigners in general and youths in general . 
  * yes ; controlled - as best we can - for conflating factors there 's still an issue . 
  you do know that fact do n't you , so shall we not pretend there 's not something odd to address and instead shall we try to address it ? 
  let 's both try to be honest here , and do better than racists and pc-liberals , both of whom are utterly unhelpful . 
   * please tell me why these debates are always only about them , and not all the other factors that also matters * all my life i 've listened to debates about poverty and social deprivation and its links to crime . 
  where have you been that you 've never come across those debates ? 
   * also , the culture obviously does not promote such behaviour . 
  there is a different between promoting and not condemning * there 's a matter of degree but you 've gone a bit further than i have . 
  obviously some members of the community publicly condemn the criminal behaviour of a minority ; i think , though , that the contemporary culture of islam * does * promote such behaviour . 
  i do n't mean they take out adverts on the sides of buses urging ` youths ' to rape ; but in promoting a view of human sexuality that sees men as hardly able to control themselves if presented with an un-veiled woman ; with a role-model who consummated marriage to a girl aged 9 ; with a disregard for women that counts them as second-rate ; then i think it * does * promote the attitudes that culminate , in the extreme , in this sort of behaviour . 
   * when a non-white does it , we see it as a direct casuation of them being non-white * you 're confusing a few things . 
  probably deliberately . 
  firstly , i 'm talking about the contemporary culture of islam , not any * race * . 
  secondly , nobody can plausibly suggest , and nobody tries to suggest , a causal link between being white and school shootings . 
  on the other hand , i * can * suggest a plausible causal connection between a contemporary view of women in islam and violence towards women . 
  ayaan hirsi ali and theo van gogh [ ** made a film about it ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/submission_ ( 2004_film ) . 
  they threatened her with death and murdered him . 
  i think it 's because they have an educated liberal 's fear of * appearing * to be racist ; they 're confusing fact and appearance . 
   * the culture obviously does not promote such behaviour * i do n't know what you mean . 
  i wo n't insult you by quoting the statistics . 
  trevor philips , the ( black ) chair of the uk 's equality and human rights commission , says it would be ` fatuous ' to dismiss racial and cultural factors in the recent rochdale sex-grooming case . 
  it seems you 'd like to be fatuous . 
  the issue is n't whiteness . 
  it 's muslimness . 
  because , oddly enough , something similar has happened over here in the uk and there 's a serious question about the culture that can support and promote such behaviour ; not that it 's * unique * in this but that it * features over-much * . 
  a culture which had warped views about sexuality , women , and non-muslims . 
  in what way would they be being racist ? 
   * fascism came through majority rule * as i said , it has its problems ... 
   * majority decides what 's good . 
  and everyone has to abide * sounds like democracy to me . 
  has its problems , of course , as plato observed . 
  if in future you could somehow - perhaps using italics - indicate those parts of your remarks you 'd prefer people did n't read , take seriously , or quote back at you , it 'd be much easier . 
   * without individual cultures losing their identity . 
  * that 's correct : multiculturalism ( see , the clue 's in the name ) . 
  something you said did n't exist . 
   * we can go with a melting pot approach like the us * ... which you have n't done ? 
  but that 's the antithesis of multiculturalism , is n't it . 
  so you 've so far tried ... . ? 
  why do n't you go and look up the definition of ` multiculturalism ' and then get back to me . 
   * attempts to build a multicultural society in germany have `` utterly failed '' , chancellor angela merkel says . 
  *  * she said the so-called `` multikulti '' concept - where people would `` live side-by-side '' happily - did not work , and immigrants needed to do more to integrate - including learning german . 
  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multikulti all just chimeras , i suppose . 
   * multiculturalism was never a reality * no , i know ... remember ? 
  i suggestd it had failed ? 
  so i was obviously implying it had n't ever been a reality ? 
  comprehension problem ? 
  but there were aspirations , and policies enacted to attempt to make those aspirations a reality . 
  you 're prepared to tolerate those anti-gay stickers , are you ? 
  do you think i should find your attitude laudable ? 
   * what does that even mean ? 
  `` cultures '' being equally valuable or not ? 
  * well , you may remember not too long ago , you wrote :  * [ not all cultures are of equal value ? 
  pretty sure some germans thought that ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/112z2k/multiculturalism_what_exactly_we_the_europeans/c6iuqav ) * and unless you were having an oddly coherent fit at the keyboard i presume that when you typed it you thought you were saying something understandable , that you understood . 
  if you try hard to remember what you thought you were saying then , you 'll answer your own question . 
   * the people we are talking about are living in our countries and they wo n't go away * yup , we 're not expecting that . 
  what we 're suggesting is that perhaps multiculturalism has to some extent failed . 
  and that in the same way we can accept that our culture has progressed over time , so that our western culture in the west now is superior to that before , say slave emancipation and the extension of the vote to women ; so might cultures be more or less admirable across geographical and social space . 
   * there 's no harm in headscarves . 
  * i can immediately think of two ways in which there might be harm . 
  three ways . 
  four ways . 
  to wit : * cultural pressure on women to conform that they wo n't be able to escape * maintenance of a ` them and us ' attitude * persistence of a medieval superstition * anachronistic and patriarchal view of female modesty and sexuality . 
  i 'm sure there are others . 
  no : rather , that if we tolerate their views rather than challenge them , then there 'll be in existence , unchallenged , far more homophobia . 
  i simply repeated your argument , silly as it was . 
   * my point was that , akin to nazi germany , you all seem to think that some cultures are superior to others . 
  * your clear implication was that supposing some cultures were less valuable than others was akin to nazism . 
  here 's something for you to put in your pipe for smoking : i think that the virulently , violently antisemitic nazi culture was less valuable than the cultures it tried to destroy . 
  how about you , logic boy ? 
  you do n't think what is true ? 
  it is a fact that muslims are less tolerant of homosexuality than the mostly secular west . 
  it is a fact that things like this happen : [ east end `` gay free zone '' stickers ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12526820 ) what do you think is n't true ? 
  i think you 'll find that * if * we are tolerant of traditional muslim cultures * then * there 'll be a lot less tolerance of gays . 
  or were you under the impression that contemporary islam welcomed and embraced sexual orientation diversity ?
