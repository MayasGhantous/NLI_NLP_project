  * because * nazis hated and murdered jews * then * it must be the case that all cultures are equally valuable ? 
  i think perhaps you 'll have to do better than that . 
  there 's an argument to be had but your miserable effort is n't it . 
  you :  * you 're being , again , completely illiterate if you see ...

  care to let me know how animal farm is n't a criticism of the left ? 
  or perhaps you do n't think soviet communism was of the left ?

   * i 'm done with you . 
  * i 'm sure you have a lot more stupidity to be squeezed out yet , boyo . 
   * for someone who gets so mad about the injustices of capitalism against poor white people * i do n't . 
  i habve no idea what you 're talking about . 
   * it 's harrison bergeron in real life * by which i of course mean , it 's the lunatic egalitarianism in bergaron ; not , it 's whatever the political settlement was in bergaron . 
  what a very , very silly misreading you 've managed there . 
   * completely illiterate if you see ... 
  animal farm as a critique of the left wing * i just read this again and i 'm utterly gobsmacked . 
  in what way was soviet russia not left wing ? 
   * adulate someone who violently hated the irish * whom do i adulate ? 
   * refusing to read texts in their contexts * i do n't do that . 
  i said the meaning of a text was n't resident in vonnegut 's brain . 
  you just drew an unwarranted , sweeping conclusion from that and decided to contest an incontestable remark . 
   * i know what i 'm talking about * you really do n't if you think orwell did n't criticise the left . 
  he informed on communists to the british security services . 
  you really did n't know that , did you ? 
  so ... my remark about * harrison bergeron * drew an analogy between the ideology in that story - of ludicrous , enforced , egalitarianism - and the similar , ludicrous , enforced egalitrianism in this one instance . 
  have you been so silly as to think i was drawing an analogy between the * political arrangement * in * bergaron * , to the extent they 're described in * bergaron * , and that in sweden ? 
  and what makes you suppose that * bergaron * describes a fascist rather than a communist state ? 
  what a very silly and peverse way to think . 
  i see you do n't actually know your orwell . 
  if you think that just because he was in the ilp and wrote for * tribune * that his work did n't criticise the left could i suggest you start with * homage to catalonia * and read what he has to say about the communists ' deliberate stymieing of the effort to halt franco . 
  so ... how does my remark about one bureaucrat imply fascism ? 
  how is an implication of my remark about one bureaucrat , ` fascism ' , simple boy ? 
   * context means more than just authorial intent * and i specifically mentioned only vonnegut 's intent , the question at issue here . 
  do n't be dishonest . 
   * there 's literally a group of people called proles * sorry , i meant * animal farm * . 
  my mistake . 
  but ... as it happens , as 1984 was a response by orwell to the totalitarianism of the soviet union and fascism , i think you 're on thin ice . 
  the fact that there 's the party , the inner party and the proles , obviously modeled on the soviet union , is an indication by him of the * failure * of the egalitarian ideals of communism * just * as much as animal farm was . 
   * 1984 was an image of failed egalitarianism * but it was , was n't it . 
  it was exactly that . 
   * to think of what he did as fascist . 
  * i did n't . 
  did you ? 
  why did you say that then ? 
   * authorial intention is important . 
  any literary critic knows to read a text in context . 
  * well , that 's homer and sophocles screwed then . 
   * you know how the false egalitarianism of the society is evinced by the handicapper general owning a gun * a very obvious echo or the end of 1984 , also a satire on the impossibility and failure of collectivist egalitarianism, 
   * it 's forcing one to maintain standards * no , it 's forcing one to reduce one 's standards to accommodate the bureaucrat 's own lower standards . 
   * do his job and adhere to the meal plan * it depends what you think his job is , or largely is , or solely is . 
  to cook good , healthy meals for the kids ; or to peddle back and cook * worse * meals to appease a pen-pusher . 
  it seems to me that in your claim that his job is to adhere to rules you 're guilty of the same rule-fetishism you 're saying the bureaucrat was guilty of . 
  either you are , or else it is n't * simply * the job of the cook to cook to the * lowest * standard permissible . 
  incidentally , you 've given me pause for thought here . 
  of course we 're all aware of vonnegut 's politics and the unlikelihood of his * not * meaing * bergaron * ironically . 
  but dismissing for a moment as naive the notion that the meaning of a text resides in the now-dead brain of the author , i do wonder if the power of the satire was so great it could n't be kept in place by vonnegut 's slightly unsophisticated politics and his best intentions . 
  i think it at least arguable that the dystopia of * bergaron * is inevitably read as a satire of the left , not of the right 's fear of the left , because the logic of the story itself resists vonnegut 's own intentions . 
  vonnegut has been hoist by his petard : he 's written a story that unwittingly undermined his own * weltanschauung * . 
  you 're a bit angry , are n't you . 
   * it has nothing to do with the individual cook being `` too good '' and all to do with overzealous bureaucrats trying to keep their public schools at the same standard of nutrition * right : so one over-zealous bureaucrat is trying to keep all schools to the same standard by forcing one to reduce standards . 
  now unless you took my original remark to mean that the satiric , dystopic world of * harrison bergeron * had ** literally ** come to pass ... what are you arguing with ? 
  except for yourself , of course ? 
  it * does n't matter * that he wrote it as a satire and * it does n't matter * that you like to parade the fact you know that . 
  that * is n't the point * that in this case , this is harrison bergeron for real . 
  you could perhaps read it as that , although there is dispute about it . 
  however , this is harrison bergeron without any irony . 
  er ... no i 'm not . 
  i 'm implying that * this particular story * is a consequence of a mad egalitarianism . 
  how is it unfair to other schools ? 
  is it right always to consider a difference of fortune , of faculties , of endowments * unfair * ? 
   * where people who were naturally graceful were required to wear weights * not brave new world . 
  you 're thinking of [ ** harrison bergeron ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harrison_bergeron ), 
  it 's [ ** harrison bergeron ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harrison_bergeron ) in real life . 
  [ ed : this has been voted down * why * ? ], 
  it gets rather technical but in short most pr systems do n't get around the problem . 
  * that 's all fine and dandy , but no one is attempting to convert ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide ranking . 
  * that 's exactly what you 're trying to do . 
  what country are you voting in ? ', 
  no preference voting system satisfies all the criteria described in arrow 's impossibility theorem : in particular , stv fails to achieve independence of irrelevant alternatives ( like most other vote-based ordering systems ) as well as monotonicity . ', 
   * `` most legitimate practically feasible parliament '' . 
  * there are voting systems which get around the problem . 
   * there 's a parliament which is filled through a pr electoral system . 
  as far as legitimacy goes , this is the most legitimate parliament we can get , * this is untrue . 
  i 'd advise you to acquaint yourself with [ ** arrow 's impossibility theorem ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arrow's_impossibility_theorem ) and stop making assumptions . 
  pr is * not * ` more legitimate ' . 
   * therefore more legitimate * unelected appointees have more democratic legitimacy than directly elected politicians ? 
  * right ... *, 
   * to say that the netherlands is therefore not democratic is ridiculous . 
  * it might be if anyone had actually said that . 
  right ... so that 's * not * as legitimate , is it ? 
  appointed by patronage .
