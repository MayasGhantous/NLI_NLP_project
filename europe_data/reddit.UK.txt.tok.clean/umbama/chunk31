   * more than the british royal family * but that 's a non sequitur . 
  that a very , very sorry defence of a political institution that has been * deliberately designed * relatively recently in an age of universal franchise . 
  is that really your best shot ? 
  yes . 
  so i wrote , * jewish referring to an ethnicity * meaning : the word ` jewish ' ** when ** referring to an ethnicity . 
  and that is the way you intended . 
  how do you think the commission has any democratic legitimacy ? 
  but that was n't what i was talking about . 
  it seems you 're confused between the religious ideology of islam , and pretty fundamentalist islam at that on the one hand ; and some strange notion of racial purity on the other . 
  no it does n't ` work this way ' . 
  i know what you mean with your comment but i think that , while it 's absolutely fair to loathe the nuttier ideologies associated with islam , it 's best not to assert something essential about europeans that 's about * race * . 
  i think people who are ethnically arabs can be - and in fact are - perfectly fine europeans . 
  and on the other hand , there are many people who are what you are referring to as ` ethnic europeans ' who make a very bad job of being european . 
   * why are all muslims held responsible * where is anyone doing that ? 
  by the way : * jewish * , referring to an ethnicity , can not be said to have an ` inherent ideiology ' , unless of course you 're a raving antisemitic lunatic . 
  * muslim * , referring to set of religious assertions , habits and practices - could reasonably be said to have one or more ideologies . 
  what absolute bollocks . 
  you really ought to think about your position if you find yourself coming up with such utter shit . 
  you hear christians wishing for or threatening the end of freedom and democracy ? 
  i do n't think you do * really * . 
   * but it is a gross and insulting over-reaching of authority * do you think a nation should n't be able to say who does or does not enter or cross their airspace ? 
   * we do n't even question them anymore * who does n't ? 
  how do you know ? 
   * what 's happening here , some sort of moron convention * very good . 
  in what way ? 
  do you oppose in principle the idea of no-fly lists ? 
  or of sharing the information ? 
  or of being careful who 's in a plane overhead ? 
  what exactly is it that you think is wrong ? 
  yes , thanks for the correction . 
  well start somewhere . 
  * ` invaded by islamists ' is hyperbole . 
  * ` french people are asleep ' - well , i think they 're perhaps not fully aware to what might be happening * ` overrun ' is obviously scare-mongering * ` pureblood french ' can be read here as the opinion of the incomers rather than the opinion of the poster ... just about * ` history of having no backbone ' is a little unfair and really only applies in the last 100 years or so , to the extent it applies at all so we can by and large throw away ** 86mitso ** 's contribution * except * that he is touching upon a genuine concern that it seems to me mainstream politics is refusing to engage with . 
  i could n't have written what you wrote but i * did * understand it , just about . 
  i should go back to france sometime soon ... 
  i think ** 86mitso ** was n't making a claim there was any such thing . 
  he clearly wrote about * other people 's perceptions * . 
  in the main . 
  the inhabitants of the * banlieu . 
  * the subjects of racism , poorly integrated , semi-feral , resentful , culturally distinct , largely poor , with what culture they have remaining from their own ancestral countries being quite antithetical to traditional french culture . 
   * they are rioting because of injustices done unto them * are they simply not in control of themselves , do you think ? 
  and what injustices are you talking about ? 
   * lots of these ` youths ' are muslims . 
  i 'm not saying that because i 'm racist * well , no , ` muslim ' is n't a race , is it ? 
   * he died as he hit the electric fence . 
  while the cop did n't inflict the injury and the whole reason there was a chase was a bit ambiguous , the community still had an uproar about it blaming the death on the cop * except of course it was n't the policeman 's fault , was it . 
  they tried to arrest some youths on report of a robbery and the youths ran and hid in an electricity substation . 
  what 's the ` ambiguity ' ? 
   * is that is an angry desperate cry for help * it 's low-level criminal behaviour by semi-feral ` youths ' who have n't been sufficiently integrated into french culture and do n't care to behave in a civilised manner . 
  ` youths ' is a euphemism . 
  if you want to understand you 'll need to work out what it 's a euphemism * for * . 
  added you to my ignore list . 
   * english is an ethnic group * i 'm from the uk myself . 
  english is * not * an ethnic group . 
   * that is the difference between the term british and english . 
  * no it is n't . 
  i 'm welsh , not english , but i 'm also british , you ignoramus . 
  ` british ' simply means , anyone from the british isles . 
  i see your integration 's not coming along too well . 
  i can see perhaps why * you * do n't feel english . 
   * the vast majority of parents immigrant or not do n't bother to sit down and teach their kids languages * this is kinda my point , is n't it . 
   * the only way you can tell we 're not english is by our skin colour * yes , because no english people are black ... ... * jeez *  * does n't mean they cease to use their own mother tongue * i 'm not suggesting they should . 
  i am , though , suggesting they might want to teach their kids the language of the country they 've decided to move to . 
  teeming, 
   * disagree on your ( and probably , my ) definition of equality , freedom of speech , laicit\u00e9 , government monopoly on force , etcetera ? 
  * then they 're simply wrong . 
  you can use it as the basis for * something * . 
  the teacher only * chose * to learn turkish because the children she 'll be caring for , in germany , will be speaking turkish and will be unable to speak german . 
  you might want to pause and wonder why . 
   * so you are suggesting that the west , particularly the us has never threatened anyones in the middle easts liberty ? 
  * nope . 
   * i am only counting those killed by the us and their allies . 
  still outnumbers those on your list * they do indeed . 
  but then i will add to my list everyone killed by muslims in the middle east . 
  then i win . 
  you 're a bit thick , it occurs to me . 
  this is n't about bodycount . 
  it 's a reply to the suggestion that nobody 's seriously threatening anyone 's liberty . 
  besides : i think you 're under the misapprehension that the majority of people killed in afghanistan and iraq were killed by the us . 
  they were n't . 
  they were muslims killed by other muslims . 
  i trust you 'll be adding them to your bodycount of people killed by muslims . 
   * they ca n't take away your freedom * oooh , you think ?

   * however this kind of talk does raise anti-islamic views * no , muslims killing and burning * in the name of their religion * demonstrate the likely accuracy of anti-islamic views . 
   * slandering a religion should be done with far more tact and class * why ? 
   * so if you know somthing is going to inspire hatred why would you do it * because the thing that 's doing the hating is wrong , is threatening you , is inimical to your values . 
   * until the danish cartoon incident , nobody even cared about depictions of mohammed * well that 's not true . 
   * what 's the point in doing it again * to push back against people who want to take away your freedom . 
   * descendants of foreigners already academically fall behind in kindergarten ( 3-5 year olds ) . 
  in kindergarten !, 
  * does this happen for all children ? 
  does it happen for foreign jewish children ? 
  does it happen for foreign korean , japanese or chinese children ? 
  link to the studies - google translate 's good enough . 
  i 'd call it an oriental religion myself . 
  but if you 're happy that the term ` middle east ' applies to morocco then i 'm happy calling it a middle eastern religion . 
  it never did get much of a toehold in reykjavik . 
  the point , of course , is that islam is traditionally , largely alien to western europe - whereas christianity and judaism are n't . 
  try colouring in all the countries that are historically christian in one colour and all those historically muslim in another get back to me if you ca n't read a compass .
