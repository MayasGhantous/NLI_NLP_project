   * islam and `` western religions '' are exactly the same . 
  the difference is christianity has been neutered by the enlightenment while islam has n't . 
  * ... so they are n't exactly the same then , are they . 
  unless you think having your balls chopped off leaves you in exactly the same circumstance as * not * having your balls chopped off . 
   * a racist * you 're despicable . 
  the really terrible thing is that racism , real racism , is a horrendous blight on society and individuals ' lives ; but for the sake of footling around on reddit you cheapen it with your pc name-calling and you debase its meaning . 
  you are really quite as disgusting as any real racist . 
  and fyi : the suggestion of two meanings to jihad - holy war and inner struggle - is relatively modern and the most traditional meaning with the deepest roots and most supporting hadith is the violent , physical one . 
  i 'd recommend trying to pick off several of the big cultural items and reading up about them first . 
  you 'll get so much more out of them if you can contextualise them . 
  it may sound terribly premeditated in a way that wo n't allow serendipity to happen but you 're only there for a short time . 
  fo r example , my favourite painting in the uffizi is this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primavera_ ( painting ) and while you may otherwise pass it with a glance and note it looks a bit old and the people seem to float about with the odd cherub and stuff , trying to understand what sort of tradition botticelli was coming out of and what is the allegory depicted makes it all so much more profound and enjoyable imho . 
  with the tiny espressos ( it 'll be a shock to you if you 're from the us , if you want something longer try a cappuccino or a latte but you wo n't get the bucketful of coffee you get in the states ) , try the small pastries with a sort of yellowy custardy filling . 
  i yearn for italian coffee . 
  oh , and if i remember rightly , florence is about twice as expensive as the towns nearby . 
  wear something black and shiny . 
  [ why the downvote ? 
  when i was in rome just before chistmas everyone was wearing black , many wearing shiny black puffa jackets . 
  it 's the slavish italian fashionista business , it 's harmless but it 's a fact . ], 
  telll me more about these muslims who do n't believe in jihad ... jihad is a ** religious duty ** of muslims . 
  did n't you know ? 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/jihad_1.shtml  * that votes bnp . 
  i 'm not impressed by your childish smears . 
   * because i know plenty of muslims , both in the west and arab world who do n't believe any of those things * you know a religious muslim who does n't believe in jihad ? 
  do tell . 
   * read what i write you fucking idiot * yes ... what you * actually * wrote was that it is ` deeply racist to tell such lies about a religion ' there is one fucking idiot around here , sweetie , and it ai n't me . 
  do n't put words into my mouth . 
  * why did you advance your literary criticism , then ? 
  does your estimation of a cultural artefact 's worth have any bearing on its permissibility in your theocracy ? 
   * because you 're an idiot * looks like you lose . 
   * here it is again for you * which bit ? 
  you do n't mean , do you , the bit where you conflate a religion with a race when you write : * it is deeply racist to tell such lies about a religion * i presume you do n't mean to draw attention again to your own stupidity ... perhaps you mean :  * it has no place in western society whatsoever . 
  it is horribly misogynistic . 
  advocates public execution , and advocates holy war . 
  * well let 's see . 
  it certainly is misogynistic and it certainly does advocate jihad - both kinds . 
  i 'm not sure it advocates * public * execution really although several islamic regimes * practise * it . 
  do you contest any of these things ? 
  let 's assume you do n't . 
  so you 're left to argue against the claim that it has no place in western society . 
  well , the only way i can understand that is to consider it as the opinion tof the writer that they 'd prefer that it was not part of western society . 
  frankly , i 'd prefer it was n't too . 
  the history 's a done deal but i see nothing to recommend contemporary islam to anyone , nothing at all . 
  drink coffee . 
  as you 'll be in florence , take a trip to siena . 
  gorgeous town with the most lovely piazza , the piazza del campo ( where they run the horse race ) . 
  i can highly recommend gubbio , ravenna , venice , rome , parma and modena . 
  simply beautiful places . 
  rome is a different sort of a place , though ... thousands of years of history all piled together . 
  it 's astonishing . 
  i think italy 's my favourite continental country ( i 'm from the uk ) . 
  france is close and i know it better and half-speak the languabge ; germany 's excellent too and spain has a bit of a shout ... but italy wins * despite * the desperate poseurs - at least they 're usually good-humoured . 
  i understand you do n't get it ; the irish do have a bit of a reputation for being a little dim , do n't they ... i guess it 's a consequence of the clever ones all getting the hell out , leaving a rather impoverished gene pool when it comes to the smarts . 
   * your country and germany has loaded greece with enourmous of debts * well do n't take the debt then ... 
   * the problem is n't islam ( look at ireland or the us , religious nuts can be a normal part of society ) * religious * christian * nuts but surely his point is that islam is a different kettle of fish ? 
   * high poverty * as with almost all immigrant groups , initially  * language barriers * their own fault  * very little social mobility * again , their own fault , to the extent it 's true . 
   * it 's not a very good novel , * fine , shall we kill him ? 
   * i am not opposed to people talking about islam * big of you . 
  incidentally , why should anyone be concerned if you * were * opposed ? 
   * i just asked for people not to be bigoted little shits when doing so * care to point out this bigotry you 're so obsessed with ? 
  apart from your comment that distinguished between european muslims and bigots as if it were the case that european muslims could not be bigots ... which is simply bigotry . 
  is n't it . 
   * but thanks for judging me without knowing me * i did n't . 
  you told all of us that being irish abroad is a superpower . 
  so i know to avoid you like the plague . 
   * i sample local cuisine , i hang out with locals * well la-di-da . 
   * avoid irish like the plague * snap . 
  being irish abroad ~ ~ is a superpower ~ ~ you 're a self-regarding twat . 
  fixed that for you . 
  have another potato and a pint o ' plain - it 's yer only man . 
   * there are all kinds of racial undercurrents in islamophobia * well , it 's what you tried to unsuccessfully assert , true . 
   * you guys * i 'm one person . 
  i 'm not ` you guys ' . 
   * i conceded and switched to the term bigot instead * and that 's better is it ? 
  to call anyone suggesting that contemporary islam is something of a problem , a ` bigot ' . 
   * freedom of speech is all that matters * nope . 
  it is n't all . 
  but i 'll go with mill 's defence of it over your pathetic pc name-calling . 
  do you know , i 've just seen salman rushdie on tv . 
  he says * the satanic verses * would n't get published these days . 
  that 's where your attitude gets us . 
  because european muslims ca n't themselves be bigots ? 
  tell you what . 
  ignore it . 
  ah , yes , that 's when you deliberately elided religion with race , is n't it . 
   * instead you 're completely focused on blaming everything on them * blaming murderers for murder ? 
  why , yes , i do that . 
  what do you do ? 
   * improving the social conditions that cause crime * oooh , now , you 're off on a rather difficult one there . 
   * shows that there was a hidden agenda behind the war * well , no . 
  it shows that people were , very sensibly , planning for management of important infrastructure after a war . 
  what else would you have had them do ? 
   * no , i `` deny their moral agency '' , by which i mean i find their actions somewhat more understandable , because of their situation as pawns between western super powers . 
  * that 's a really troubling thing for you to say . 
  i meant ` moral agency ' to mean that they were adult and aware and able to make their own moral choices and to be responsible for their own decisions . 
  you seem to have read that in exactly the opposite way , to mean that somehow their actions were caused and beyond their control . 
   * should those killers be held responsible for what they 've done ? 
  of course . 
  * ok , good , we agree . 
  so let me now go back through your history and find where you 've once before now suggested that the murderers were in fact the murderers and are in fact responsible .
