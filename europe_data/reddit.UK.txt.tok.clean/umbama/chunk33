  i 'll get back to you . 
  yes , you 've repeated a chunk from the independent . 
  that is not symons * lobbying for war * though , is it ? 
   * how are you reading that out of what i said ? 
  * yup . 
  going to answer either of my questions now ? 
  1 ) what 's your source for saying symons lobbied for war 2 ) do you deny the moral agency of murderers because they 're from the middle east ? 
  where have you read that lady symons lobbied the us to go to war ? 
  that is n't in your link . 
   * i just chose the independent as it was the first google result . 
  * well do you have something to back up your claim , then ? 
   * you 're going to have an extremely hard time convincing me the kllings ... * you do n't think that the people who actually did the killings were responsibly for their actions ? 
  that 's a not-very-subtle sort of orientalism , is n't it ? 
  deny moral agency to these people because they 're a bit darker-skinned than you ? 
  you do n't know , i suppose , that the man who _ invented the gaia hypothesis _ is in favour of nuclear too ? 
  the independent is just reporting on forward planning . 
  the vast majority of those killings were deaths caused by other arabs and persians . 
  so ... no ... it is n't ` fair to say ' any such thing . 
   * but at least they do n't invade our countries and kill us by the hundreds of thousands in the interests of gaining more natural resources * that 's your understanding of , say , afghanistan is it ? 
   * the root of the problem lies in post-colonial thinking of western countries * no , the root of the problem lies with cultures that think it 's at all reasonable to murder people because their silly religious beliefs are challenged . 
  that 's not irony ... 
  what bigotry ? 
  but accurate ... 
  the the , i think . 
  not exactly . 
  for instance , during wwii , dismissing the legality of selling arms to the uk and the inadvisability of selling arms to germany is n't quite captured by saying :  * i see , it 's a nationality thing . 
  * is it ? 
  you 're missing something rather important , are n't you ? 
  it is a lovely country , the parts i 've visited . 
  sitting back here in the uk i actually miss italian coffee ... i yearn for it . 
  it 's very peculiar . 
  it 's said that the smell of coffee is always better than it tastes but in italy that 's at least a debatable claim . 
  seconded for italy . 
  before i traveled to the continent from the uk i had no idea what good coffee was . 
  in france , germany and spain i found out . 
  then i went to italy and i * really * found out . 
  go to italy . 
  tagged as an idiot . 
  fair enough , thanks . 
  just scaremongering then . 
  again , this is a report on the same remarks :  * `` whether it would be right to stop people communicating via these websites and services when we know they are plotting violence , disorder and criminality * clearly just raising it as an idea , clearly talking about preventing access for those you know are using it to engage in criminal behaviour . 
  the article about turkey is talking about a blanket ban and is far more advanced than cameron 's raising it as a possibility affecting only some people and only in limited cases . 
  these two are not the same . 
  so that 's a suggestion - nothing more - of a ban on * individual people * using social media . 
  that is not a ban on social media . 
  no more than banning you from driving a car for dangerous driving is a ban on cars . 
  i 'm responding to your intemperance and rudeness . 
  that does n't mean i 'm ` judgemental ' , whatever you suppose that actually means . 
  i think i 'll just put you on my ignore list . 
   * britain also said they would ban social media during london riots * wut ? 
  where ? 
  when ? 
   * listen , nobody is debating that . 
  * i agree you were n't debating it . 
  you were disputing it . 
   * you stated that because it is `` literally the word of god '' , it is n't debatable in any way * i did n't . 
  i presume you 're lying now because you 've backed yourself into an unsustainable position . 
  i wrote :  * one 's amenable to revision , debate and holding at arm 's length . 
  the other 's pretty non-negotiable . 
  * the modifier * pretty * is kinda synonymous here with ` very much ' or ` quite a lot indeed ' , which does not mean ` absolutely not at all ' . 
   * was my explanation of transubstantiation exhaustive * it was non-existent . 
  you did n't give an explanation of transubstantiation . 
  you simply demonstrated you did n't understand it . 
   * ou 're arguing with muslims about what islam is based on what you say muslims say about it . 
  * i think you 're a bit confused . 
  i have told you what i know muslims say about the book ; and then i asked you what your muslim friends say about the book . 
   * yes , of course they mostly accept the dogma * indeed - and i suppose you know that by basing your understanding on what you say muslims say about it ? 
  yes ? 
  and that dogma is that the koran is a * dictation *  * just like my catholic friends accept the dogma that the little cracker literally turns into the body of christ * that is n't a proper understanding of the catholic dogma of transubstantiation . 
  the dogma holds that the * substance * of the wafer is the body of christ while the * properties * of the wafer remain unchanged . 
  it 's a rather technical idea and obviously ... crackers ... but nevertheless your misunderstanding of it is interesting , given your additional and now unlikely claim to comprehend islamic dogma . 
  so the police did n't dive straight in because they did n't want to mess up the forensics . 
  but ** eight hours ** ????? 
   * also , fuck right off with `` i 'm not going to say , flatly , that you 're wrong . 
  '' * i 've met a few estonians and thankfully none of them have been quite as obnoxious as you , so i 'll just count you as an outlier . 
  i think we used to have an ok-ish native tradition ; and then for one reason or another it was a bit swamped by the rush to the cities , being the first into the industrial revolution , and especially the austerity of the 2 world wars . 
  but bubbling quietly away underneath were always fine traditions from the regions that have been rediscovered . 
  we have more cheeses than france , would you believe ? 
  but the 50 or so years of quite bad food left their toll . 
  my mother did n't taste garlic until she was around 30 . 
  i think , by the way , we have dipped into so many cuisines simply because of our empire . 
   * we ( and our ally saudi arabia ) are mainly responsible for that * how infantilising of the muslim world you are . 
  how patronising you are . 
  how racist you are . 
  we ca n't possibly accept that these people are adult enough to be making their own decisions , can we ? 
  only we in the west are fully adult , with sophisticated moral capabilities and responsibilities . 
  these wogs are like children , are n't they , and ca n't help themselves . 
   * so any moderate muslim actually has lots of reasons to hate the western world * by definition such a person would n't be moderate . 
  is english not your first language ? 
  er ... * ` at the extreme ' would explicitly be anything ** but ** * all * muslims . 
  * * muslim * is not a race * the architects of the holocaust were n't christian * your ` logic ' is anything but aside from that you 're doing very well indeed . 
  no , that 's ok , your english is fine - what i mean is , indian food is now the most popular takeaway food ( and restaurant food , i think ) in the uk and people of indian ancestry are now firmly part of britian - so does it count as british food ? 
  because it 's very nice ... 
  i 'm not going to say , flatly , that you 're wrong . 
  what i was told about the soviet occupation was appalling , atrocious . 
  i 'm not going to weigh in now and tell you how you should behave towards ethnic russians ... but it 's the one blight on an otherwise very positive image of estonia i have , even if it 's entirely understandable . 
   * they need to pass a test * yes , but why ? 
  nonsense . 
  of course you can find good bread , very easily . 
  what do you count as english ?
