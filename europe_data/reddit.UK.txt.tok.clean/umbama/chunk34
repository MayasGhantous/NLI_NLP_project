  is indian food english now , for example ? 
  they 've been there for decades . 
  why refuse them citizenship ? 
  well , i know about the history . 
  i had a long chat with an old man in a museum in tallinn who took be on a brief romp through the rather unfortunate history of estonia . 
  i do understand . 
  but the decision not to grant citizenship to non-estonians who 'd immigrated during the soviet occupation was a very clear attempt to marginalise russians . 
  and there was the fuss over the war memorial , was n't there . 
   * why do you feel that you should be the one who decides what islam is ? 
  * nice try . 
  i do n't . 
  i 'm repeating what muslims themselves claim about the book . 
  tell me : how do your muslim friends say the book came about ? 
   * t 's so interesting that you feel somehow competent to make that judgment for them * i 'm telling you what the koran is , according to muslims . 
  i 'm surprised you seem not to have known . 
   * it 's complete and utter myth that islam is `` non-negotiable '' . 
  * you misread what i said . 
  i said that it 's non-negotiable that the koran is the directly dictated word of god . 
   * clearly not all 1.5 billion muslims agree on a single interpretation . 
  * clearly . 
  which is why your misinterpretation of my comment seems wilful and egregious and suggests to me that you 're not actually concerned with having an honest conversation . 
  that 's a bit of a false equivalence , do n't you think ? 
  for example : your non-fundamentalist christian friends would consider the gospels as a partly fictional account , perhaps * inspired * by their god . 
  your muslim friends , on the other hand , would consider the koran as the * directly dictated word of god * . 
  one 's amenable to revision , debate and holding at arm 's length . 
  the other 's pretty non-negotiable . 
  the two are n't equivalent . 
  yes , i think the best way of my getting a better or longer recording is to go to istanbul . 
  well , i 've wanted to visit for a long time , nearly went last december but ended up popping off to rome instead . 
  istanbul it is , then . 
  there 's a piece of alevi music i heard a few years ago . 
  i 'd love a copy of the whole song . 
  i think it 's marvelous . 
  wonder if anyone can help ... ? 
   * if this is right wing in your opinion , then you seem to have a strange concept of what goes for right wing . 
  * exactly . 
  the left has bent over backwards recently to accept that a particular reading of islam is ` the ' islam . 
  in doing that it 's made common cause against some traditional * b\u00eate noires * - like the us - with the most regressive , human-rights-denying , intolerant nutters you could imagine . 
  there * are * other voices in the islamic world . 
  there * are even * secularists . 
  there are feminists , there are some brave homosexuals , trying to fight against societies that are not * even * medieval . 
  the left has done a huge disservice to these people . 
  it 's abandoned the groups and the people i was brought up to think were the natural causes and constituencies of the left and it 's embraced instead representatives of a fascistic theocracy . 
  the majority of the immigrant indian sub-continental muslims in the uk come , of course , from pakistan and bangladesh and so would n't have a particularly different experience of the british . 
  both communities have kept their own cultures to some extent * and * have in part adapted them and merged them with a contemporary british society . 
  the problems that we experience come in the main from the muslim not the hindu or sikh populations . 
  this is n't a race issue , it 's a problem to do with the regressive , intolerant and presumptuous religion of islam as filtered through certain communities ' practices . 
   * westerners call us backwards non-democratic barbarians . 
  * i think we rather admire you in the uk . 
  e-voting , and all that , the singing revolution , skype , a relatively healthy economy . 
  only negative thing i have in my mind about estonia is the perhaps dodgy way you guys have regarded ethnic russians . 
  islam is a race , now ? 
   * because i 'm gay , and i have muslim friends , and they 're fine * are they religious ? 
   * the hindu have the same problem . 
  * does n't seem to be true in the uk . 
  we do n't seem to be bothered by hindus calling for prior vetting of tv programmes about their faith , or for changes to the law to accommodate their behaviours , or at the extreme , by bombing underground trains and buses . 
  i know that . 
  but underlying the joke is the common , reflex trope that the americans really are that bad . 
  manning 's not in gitmo and whatever you think of his treatment he has certainly committed a very serious offence . 
  and assange is a self-regarding idiot . 
  unless , of course , you think that revealing the names of opponents of the belarus regime was somehow admirable ... 
  er ... i do n't think young was talking about gitmo , was he ? 
  so your response is a total non-sequitur . 
  not really a very good effort . 
  really ? 
  why would they do that then ? 
  i was under the impression that the people left in gitmo were those detained on battlefields , or worked for al qaeda , and suchlike . 
  you know differently ? 
  only to save your blushes because it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . 
   * i do n't enjoy having my elucidations `` summed up '' as `` seriously , your reason for support european federalism is ` why not ' ? '' . 
  * then do n't do it , you precious little flower : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/yw3my/why_is_europe_avoiding_the_fword_federalism/c5zfdcx, 
  because , accepting the usefulness of the principle of subsidiarity that the eu gives only lip service to i 'd prefer to keep powers devolved ; because the eu is a deeply undemocratic and unaccountable bureaucracy ; because the needs and desires of the different peoples ca n't be adequately met by rules and regulations imposed from the centre ; because our legal systems are very different ; because our economies are very different ; because the consequences are unforeseeable ; because unless there 's a powerful reason for imposing such change i would caution against unintended consequences . 
  ` why not ' just does n't cut it . 
  is that really the best you can manage ? 
   * why not ? 
  * seriously , your reason for support european federalism is ` why not ' ? 
  so why federate ? 
   * more common policy , less overhead , i guess * we can have common policy if we all agree on it . 
  you seem to be advocating the imposition of common policies by * bypassing * individual member states ' wishes . 
  otherwise why federate ? 
   * in germany , the federation ca n't just decide it wants to legislate something and the states have to bow , the federation has defined areas it can legislate , the states legislate other areas , and if conflicts arise , both have to legislate in agreement . 
  * so what would be the purpose of a federal europe , then ? 
  he * said * the commonwealth . 
  they 're two very different things . 
  i thought the point about the us was that it was supposed to be a melting point rather than multicultural ? 
   * you know what i meant * i have no idea what you 're now claiming you meant then . 
  i only know what you wrote . 
   * it is a forum , an intergovernmental organization , but not a union of states with sovereign powers separated from the nations ' themselves * it is exactly what it 's always been . 
  now what are you claiming to mean * this * time ? 
   * it seems to me , is that britain does n't have the commonwealth anymore * it was still there the last time i looked . 
  are you always so well-informed ? 
   * compared to europe * ... ? 
  it 's in europe ... 
   * coming down our throats * a slightly unfortunate turn of phrase ... 
  ` la ' , actually , but your point is correct . 
  not in the language you were writing in it does n't . 
  in the language you were writing in it does have a meaning , and that meaning is n't ` tower ' . 
  but it did . 
  see the comment immediately afterwards where the word ` tour ' in the context of an english sentence , was taken to be ... yes ... the english word ` tour ' . 
  calling it by its french name when you 're speaking english is .
