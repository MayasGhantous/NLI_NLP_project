  what do n't you understand about that ? 
  are you a bit simple , perhaps ? 
  it 's perverse to deliberately choose aberrant , non-customary , peculiar , possibly confusing and unheard-of versions when you 're simply trying to make yourself understood . 
  of course there 's not much sense to * which * french names we anglicise and which we do n't but given the facts on the ground it 's just weird . 
  take * paris * itself , as a counter-example . 
  but the guy 's speaking english , not french . 
  his response was perverse . 
  no , not at all . 
  no , just rude people and officious functionaries . 
  really wo n't do . 
  nothing like the opinions of many of the muslims canvassed . 
  the coastline is very nice . 
  i just had a few bad experiences and , honestly , the crowds at plitvice completely ruined the place for me . 
  except : until the court ruled this way they were being arrested . 
  now the court has ruled , they 're not . 
  so the law was clear was it ? 
  and the law represents the will of the people does it ? 
  apparently not :  * interior minister manuel valls said after the ruling that the government would act swiftly to amend french law *, 
  oh , that 's a technicality . 
  you know perfectly well that the * reason * immigrants in france illegally are n't in prison is * because * it 's desirable and possible to deport them . 
  plitvice lakes are completely crowded with tourists and the croatians are the most unfriendly i 've met in europe . 
  ahem ... 
  you make a wonderful , interesting , germane point . 
  well done you . 
   * there is definitely a problem * not according to the title of this post . 
  and unless those 24 % , 50-odd % and so on have melted into the ether since i do n't see your point, 
  that 24 % have all melted away . 
  everyone who wanted sharia 6 years ago has changed their mind since . 
  got it . 
  so ... you 'd count a quarter of muslims as extremist would you ? 
  that 's a large proportion of any adherents of a faith to be called * extremist * . 
  at what point would you start supposing there 's something intrinsically different in such a faith ? 
  good luck with that one, 
  nothing what ? 
  how do you mean ? 
   * try the same with christians , the results will be just as much `` wtf '' . 
  * will they ? 
  you can point to polling data can you ? 
  or have you just pulled that assertion from your doubtless capacious arse ? 
  what are you trying to suggest ? 
  that i 'll find a quarter of christians believe the uk government conspired to murder its own people one day in london and blame it on a christian fundamentalist terrorist group ? 
  is that what you 're claiming would be the result of polls about christians ? 
  really ? 
   * 47 % of britons see muslims as a threat . 
  * well indeed . 
  who knows why ? 
  [ * poll shows muslims in britain are the most anti-western in europe * ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jun/23/uk.religion ) where we can also read that : * only 17 % of british muslims believe that arabs carried out the september 11th attacks and * only 32 % of muslims in britain had a favourable opinion of jews and from elsewherel * 24 % of british muslims deny that the four british muslim suicide bombers carried out the 7/7 attacks * 24 % of british muslims believe the british government carried out the 7/7 attacks . 
  and also : * 45 per cent think 9/11 was carried out by the us or israel and [ from here ] ( http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/291 ) : * 33 % of muslims want sharia law as implemented in saudi arabia . 
  * 28 % of muslims agreed they dreamt of britain becoming an islamic state . 
  * 78 % wanted the danish cartoonist prosecuted . 
  * 62 % disagree with the freedom of speech if it insults religious sensibilities . 
  * 50 % said british people who insult islam should be arrested and prosecuted . 
  nice to see how well they fit in . 
   * a recent example is blair sending british troops to iraq * a recent example of what ? 
  he was subsequently re-elected . 
   * the pm asks the monarch to disregard the will of the people * no , really , he does n't . 
   * if you 're interested in this you could find many books * being patronising and incorrect at the same time is a clever trick to pull off . 
  you said the queen as head of state had those powers . 
  those powers , of course , are in fact exercised by the pm , not the queen . 
  is that because you 're getting downvoted ? 
  or for some other reason ? 
   * you 've just bitten on an irrelevant turn of phrase * ... and you get to decide which turns of phrase are relvant , and which we should pay attention to , how ... exactly ? 
   * it 's been fairly obvious that the eu has been moving slowly towards full federalisation . 
  * ok . that 's its final goal then is it . 
  the goal of * whom * exactly , do you think ? 
  yes . 
  the kindle in the us is sold for $ 89 , in the uk for # 89 . 
  see what they did there ? 
  exchange rate 's currently around $ 1.5 / # 1, 
   * if it was n't for britain fighting against the `` tobin tax '' * that would be the tax that the eu report said would adversely impact growth . 
   * you 're over analysing his language * by asking a single question , * why do we ` need ' that * ? 
  that 's ` over analysing ' is it ? 
   * if the european project is to reach it 's final goal * oooh , teleology . 
  i 'm sorry , what is the final goal ? 
  i do n't think i 've been told . 
  how is enjoying difference in europe ` anti-eu ' ? 
   * i also hope that one day europe will be a full political federation * why ? 
  what for ? 
  what gets better ? 
   * you started with `` we have n't threatened '' and now we 've come to `` it 's not really a threat '' * that 's the same thing . 
   * s head of the state he/she has many powers ( declaring war * i remember when the king declared war in 1939 ... ... . . 
  this is just a whole heap of waffly assertion . 
   * the eu will get back on its path in trying to make the institutional landscape of europe more homogenic . 
  * why on earth would you want that ? 
  i * like * the heterogeneity . 
  the point about the prisoner 's dilemma - which , incidentally , has no bearing on this - is that each prisoner is acting rationally . 
  you 've clearly never quite grasped the subtlety of the scenario . 
   * we really need to end up with a situation where spending , say , parisian taxpayers ' money in vienna is as natural as spending it in marseilles , bordeaux * why do we ` need ' that ? 
   * i do n't always have full confidence that my fellow citizens act rational , in the best interest of their community , and not entirely out of pure self-interest * what is you reason for asserting that acting in your own interest is not rational ? 
  you think that because the uk 's not in the eurozone it should have no say when it comes to concerted eu action ? 
   * david cameron threatens veto to protect uk interests * firstly , a threat to use a veto is not the same thing as a threat to you . 
  it does n't become that just because a guardian sub-editor has added the word ` threat ' to a headline . 
  secondly , if the matter 's purely a eurozone matter then let eurozone countries do want they want . 
  on the other hand , if the matter extends beyond the eurozoneto the wider eu then i do n't see the reasoning behind your complaint that all eu members should n't participate in decisions . 
  just more of your undemocratic instinct there . 
   * if it was n't for this silliness , states fighting with higher rates could be in a better position now * and you think that 's what the current problem is , do you ? 
  nothing to do with yoking together disparate economies for a political end ? 
  and finally :  * it would be interesting to see if people would like a certain bloodline for their head of state , instead of choosing democratically . 
  surely , democracy matters for them . 
  * a complete red herring .
