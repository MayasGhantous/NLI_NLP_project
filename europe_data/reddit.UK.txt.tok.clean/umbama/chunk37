  the ruling on whether a jaffa cake is in fact a cake . 
   * ound economic reasons for it being a good idea * well let 's hear them ... 
   * has an advantage of being a clear way of communication with the masses * it obscures the message . 
  case in point : eu membership and integration . 
  the british left used to be against it , as did the british right . 
  i said [ here that this was utter balls ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/uucyy/2009_eu_profiler_you_answer_a_series_of_3035/c4ymkof ) and i 'm being hugely downvoted , perhap justifiably for not expanding on the remark . 
  so let me expand on the remark . 
  this is just one up on categorising every social policy on a single left-right continuum . 
  it 's an unhelpful way of thinking ( that l-r continuum derives from the seating arrangments in the french revolutionary assembly , by the way ) . 
  if you 're socially liberal but economically _ classical liberal _ and mildly eurosceptic then your nearest party in the uk is the bnp , according to this . 
  this is utter , utter nonsense . 
  the bnp is a _ fascist _ party and is as far from socially liberal and economically classical liberal as you could imagine . 
  it 's protectionist statism with racism added on top . 
  utter balls . 
   * even though he had no idea this crisis would occur * the eurosceptics have always said this would end badly , not only because of a little-englander mentality but for quite sound economic reasons . 
   * we ca n't just shirk away from our responsibilities . 
  * not * responsibilities * but * interests * . 
  honestly , you should try the uk . 
  it 's * terrible * for coffee . 
  i think i do n't understand why you called him a comedian . 
  i think russian sounds beautiful . 
  french too , of course . 
  italian . 
  better than the uk and the us . 
  of course , for the best you really need italy . 
  3,300 years old , in the neues .

  yes . 
  really excellent museums . 
  the * schwarzwald * , down the bottom left , is sometimes said the be the spiritual home of the germans , who have an almost mystical affinity for the ancient forest . 
  i was staying outside freiburg once , cycled into the town through part of the woods and had to cycle back out again very late at night , when it was pitch black . 
  could n't see the hand in front of my face in the heart of the woods . 
  quite scary . 
  if you are down south , there 's the bavarian alps - you can ride a cable car almost to the top of germany 's highest alp , the zugspitze . 
  and there 's * der bodensee * , lake constance , and over on the north-eastern shore , the town of lindau . 
  nurnburg - nuremburg - is interesting too and they do excellent little sausages there . 
  aachen , up in the top left , a natural stopping-off point if you 're heading across from the west , is where charlemagne 's buried . 
  very interesting very old cathedral there . 
  i wonder if you could do a route something along the lines of : _ aachen across to cologne then down to freiburg via heidelburg , freiburg across to france , to orleans , down to amboise ( where leonardo 's buried and his old house is open to the public ) , back up to paris via orleans & chartres and back to brussels ? _ that sounds like a fantastic trip to me . 
  there 's be lots to see . 
  perhaps you could expand on the german bit of that . 
  incidentally , how 's your french and german ? 
  the germans tend to speak excellent english , except out east , and the french do too , though slightly less so and with less enthusiasm : but trying to speak a little german and french , no matter how badly , tends to go over very , very well - it 's really appreciated . 
  do n't mind the parisians . 
  they hate everyone . 
  oh by the way , as you 're coming from america , you will love the food . 
  the bread will probably be your biggest surprise , both the french and the germans make terrific bread and unlike us bread * it is n't sweet * . 
  french patisseries are sent from heaven , really , the shop displays are beautiful and the pastries delicious . 
  both do great coffee , though you do n't get served the endless bucketfulls you get in the states . 
  and german sausages really are excellent , and you must try them with sauerkraut . 
  do n't be ashamed if you go for the occasional mcd ... 
  i second aachen . 
  get the pass for the museum insel and you 'll be able to visit the pergamon and the neues . 
  how long do you have ? 
  i drove from from aachen down to the black forest once , that was nice - then across to bavaria and the zugspitze . 
  also , in france , the dordogne region is very attractive . 
  i know this sounds cruel but with france and germany to explore i would n't bother with belgium . 
  the whole thing is tongue-in-cheek you humourless twat . 
  according to whom ? 
  you ? 
  and you get to be the decider here ... how ? 
  it is n't a ` danish ' plot anymore than 9/11 was an american plot or 7/7 an english plot . 
  since it was decided that nations should compete against each other * as nations * , each under national flags . 
  the * very brief * thumbnail of each country does n't include their previous hosting of the olympics for * any * of them . 
  according to wikipedia :  * dr\u017eavna himna bosne i hercegovine ( cyrillic : \u0414\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u0425\u0435\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435 , national anthem of bosnia and herzegovina ) is the national anthem of bosnia and herzegovina . 
  the anthem was adopted on 25 june 1999 , by the promulgation of the law on the national anthem of bosnia and herzegovina , [ 1 ] replacing the previous anthem , `` jedna si jedina '' , which apparently excluded the country 's serb and croat communities , though , was in use from february 10 , 1998 , as the flag and coat of arms . 
  * and i 'll accept you may know better , that something 's going on and it 's being replaced . 
  or something . 
  i guarantee you that if you win any golds they 're going to play * some * tune and it 'll probably be this . 
  lighten up ffs . 
  sour grapes because of the war . 
  i think you 're quite confusing about what you 're trying to assert or explain . 
  let 's just go back to by original statement :  * there are facts of economic life that ca n't be gainsaid by political wishful thinking * now : presumably you think there are facts about the economy and economics ? 
  note that i have n't anywhere talked about market regulation . 
  just about the fact that there are economic facts . 
  i 'd have thought that the relaxing of mortgage terms in the us ( for political reasons ) through to cdos and on to the consequent damage to banks internationally illustrated quite nicely the point . 
   * market incentives can be fully controlled politically ( and are ) * all ? 
  every ? 
  that 's a rather grand statement , the evidence for which i ca n't imagine . 
  yes , politics and economics are intertwined to the extend that you might consider politics as the provisional wing of economics . 
  or vice-versa . 
  problem is , though , that there are facts of economic life that ca n't be gainsaid by political wishful thinking . 
   * firstly , a greek exit as we imagine it ( i.e. 
  greece getting out of eurozone and estabilshing the new drachma ) could kill the euro . 
  * but the point is , * it 's going to happen * . 
  whether you like it or not . 
   * veto to not show ourselves to be '' pro-european '' * where is it written , though , that ` pro ' means supporting a * political * attempt to trump economics ? 
   * a more cohesive policy on eu integration * weasel words . 
  do you mean , support further concentration of political power in central institutions ? 
  would that be a good thing ? 
  why would it be a good thing ? 
   * go to a greek island , stay in one of the resort hotels and stick around the other european people on vacation * you make it sound so attractive . 
   * also , greek people do not hate german people * of course not  * not surprised its a german website spreading bullshit rumors * absolutely . 
  not at all . 
  drop out of the euro . 
  suddenly become a very cheap holiday destination . 
  reap rewards . 
   * of course . 
  because it 's easier to pull out and dismantle the whole thing * well this is the question , is n't it . 
  you may call your step a step * forward * although you have n't made a case for it being * forward * at all .
