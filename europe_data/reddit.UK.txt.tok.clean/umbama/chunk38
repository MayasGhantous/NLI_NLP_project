  you could , if you like , typify the imbecilic , scared , self-serving , dithering postures as * decisive * if you wish but it 's not . 
  the point is that greece is likely to default * because the eurozone is a political experiment trying to force the economics * . 
  it 's * going * to fail - is failing , right now . 
   * be the big player in european affairs once and for all * dr freud would like a word . 
   * mrtulip understood perfectly well what it means * no , he called the telegraph chauvinistic . 
  it 's not . 
  it is n't a question of fault . 
  it 's more a question of what 's going to damage us - and greece of course - the most . 
  the eurozone is far from being an optimal currency area . 
  the sooner greece and others are out and this whole sorry , * politically * - driven lunacy falls apart , the better . 
  [ update ] : could i ask people downvoting to * explain * their downvoting , how they see it fits with rediquette , whether they want an echo-chamber instead of a vigorous exchange of competing views . 
  if i did n't know better i 'd attribute it to the fact that nationals of certain european countries have a shaky grasp of the value of democracy and free speech ... 
  i was n't even part of this conversation til i asked you this . 
  * that 's right , dimbo you asked what the point was of etymology with reference to someone who did n't understand the word . 
  etymology is n't an absolutely accurate guide to current meaning of course but it 's better known about than not . 
  except in your case , where not knowing things appears to be a virtue , if not an inescapable fate . 
  why ? 
  that you do n't understand what chauvinism means is obvious from your misuse . 
  i like to help dimwits like yourself by filling in other gaps in your general knowledge . 
  if you start with how chauvinism got its name then you may twig that the telegraph is not excessively nationalistic in that sense . 
   * the gauleiter bit * that 's citing * others * who object to the proposals . 
  the article itself is n't chauvinistic ( named for a ** french ** man , remember ) or condescending . 
  no , really , there 's nothing so boring as being loutish or ill-mannered . 
  the greek people i 've known in the uk were basically * very cross * all the time . 
  is that true of greeks generally ? 
   thanks, 
  you * were * in fact arguing that the us was a close enough analogy else your comment :  * you live in the united states which is a federation . 
  does that trouble you ? 
  * would have made no sense . 
  perhaps you habitually make no sense . 
  sorry no what ? 
   * uk politicians were somehow more trustworthy than european politicians * on the whole that 's true . 
  you gave me the expenses scandal and i charitably skipped over italy and gave you deep-rooted corruption right at the very top of french politics . 
  and it is n't ` somehow ' , it 's a consequence of the nature of politics and the political classes in our countries . 
  other than your hopeful assertions where 's your evidence ? 
  so ... that 's an example of an expenses scandal in the uk . 
  you do understand , do n't you , that for a * comparison * you need to * compare * ? 
  shall we start with italian politics ... no , too easy . 
  let 's try french . 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/15/jacques-chirac-corruption_n_1150300.html not just any old mp . 
  the * president * . 
  or the president before that http://www.economist.com/node/485814 the uk election expenses scandal was a minor book-fiddling by a few ignorable mps . 
  not root-and-branch corruption to the tune of milliions at the very top . 
  europe is a poor choice for a federation anything resembling the us . 
  political traditions are different across countries , the nature of the legal systems are * considerably * different , the eu is not an optimal currency zone , etc , etc , etc. 
   * i would doubt that any random uk politician is more trustworthy than a random brussels apparatus politician * not sure about that . 
   * borderline countries like the uk * borderline ? 
  because we 've never signed up to the ridiculous , unworkable euro ? 
  because we 're happy for europe to be what we all * did * sign up for it to be and not something else ? 
  because we do n't trust certain european politicians whose own grasp of democracy is shaky and whose success in their own countries was less than spectacular ? 
   * the commission can still be the only body to propose european bills * so ... what are you solving ? 
   * we 'll obviously reciprocate the tariffs * er ... why would we want to do that ? 
  if we impose tariffs things will cost uk consumers more money and we 'll be poorer . 
  otoh if the * germans * impose tariffs things will cost * them * more money and * they 'll * be poorer . 
  basic economics . 
  ` forward ' ? 
  the eu 's own report into it concluded it would reduce future economic growth . 
  how would that be ` forward ' ? 
  why is it a jaw-dropping suggestion ? 
  i do n't understand the problem here . 
  right . 
  and that might be because the eu 's own report into an ftt concluded it would reduce future economic growth . 
  as has the [ house of lords ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8932353/lords-join-fight-against-european-tobin-tax.html ) as has [ the i ~ ~ a ~ ~ ea ] ( http://www.iea.org.uk/in-the-media/press-release/financial-transactions-tax-proposals-must-be-rejected ) and it ca n't [ apply to forex markets ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2011/09/28/the-european-financial-transactions-tax-an-interesting-detail/ ) hollande 's just grandstanding . 
  yes , i understand the basic economics . 
  there is indeed a debate to be had . 
  my point was the arrogant assertion of the moral high ground . 
  i heard some idiot on * pm * saying that they did n't want to protest but thought it was a * moral obligation * . 
  they did n't then go on to explain the exact moral calculus of preferring their policies , that require inflation that would whittle away at the savings of careful , modest , ordinary people ; and that build enormous debt into the future , leaving generations to pay off their bills . 
  there 's a debate to be had , of course . 
  but this self-serving partisanship does n't help . 
  no , he 's not . 
  he 's saying that the eu does a lot * more * than , implying an acceptance of the claim that it does * at least * that . 
  if i say : * i 'm a lot more than a cat owner * , you do n't conclude i do n't own a cat , do you . 
  you can do that the other 364 days . 
  one day to remember the people in your country who were killed trying to rid europe of genocidal fascism without being obliged to play the national anthem of that genocidal fascist state really is n't too much to ask . 
   * additionally i am originally from europe . 
  * what does this mean ? 
  estonia or portugal ? 
  scotland or the czech republic ? 
  latvia or luxembourg ? 
  see what i mean ? 
   * the eu provides a lot more than peace . 
  * how does the eu provide peace ? 
  not playing the national anthem of the fascist state that invaded your country , and slaughtered millions , on the single day of remembrance is hardly ` living in the past ' . 
  kinda the point about a single day of remembrance ... 
  but the fascists are n't in power : they 're a minority expression of dissent . 
  so ... the little kid with the spray represents the fascists that were elected to the greek parliament ? 
  yes ? 
  oh you twat . 
   * the problem in the eu is not states spending money * no ... course it is n't ... . . 
  it will cost a lot of money . 
  there is a case , a traditional keynesian case , for public deficit spending during a recession : but the french state is already the biggest in terms of share of gdp in the entire eurozone and the government has n't run a surplus for * 35 years * . 
  remember that the flip side of deficit spending , according to keynes , is running a surplus during the good times . 
  * france does n't do that * . 
  you ca n't be just a cold-weather keynesian . 
  hollande has costed his spending plans at 20 billion euros over 5 years . 
  france ca n't afford for the state to grow * even larger * . 
  hollande 's not suggesting that reform is needed but that the current austerity is too much too quickly . 
  he 's just against reform * at all * . 
  this is going to make the euro nations ' willingness to manage the crisis much less plausible to the international financial community .
