  still . 
  i might be wrong . 
  it 'll be an interesting experiment . 
  he actually said that as long as he 's prime minister the uk would never join the euro . 
  i 'm sure that timing fits in with even the most optimistic estimate by pro-euro weirdos about when it might be feasible to join . 
  i think what mandelson is saying is so hedged about that any interpretation is deniable . 
  as nobody - nobody serious - has ever totally ruled out joining as * some * timr in the future then if his message is n't to restate the bleeding obvious it must be something else . 
  what might that be ? 
  you do n't seem to understand that point of that prize . 
   * i think the content of this speech highlights his intelligence though * who the fuck cares if a speech probably not even written by him betrays some evidence of intelligence ? 
  tell me : which points are ` very good ' ? 
  yes ... that would be peter mandelson for whom brad delong at berkeley has resurrected the _ stupidest man alive _ prize . 
  sorry , what worked well in the french revolution, 
   * threated to blow himself up because he `` had nothing to lose , '' was not only mad , he was also unemployed . 
  his action was seen as the benchmark of a growing desperation * this criminal bnp candidate was n't a benchmark of anything or anyone . 
  well , instead of my answering that directly , let me ask you a question . 
  why do you think you wrote :  * and when did ` jew ' become offensive by itself ? 
  * when nobody is suggesting that the word ` jew ' has become offensive by itself . 
  was it just a mistake , perhaps ? 
  i think the observation that it 's automated does n't cut it ; there are obviously modifications and interventions made . 
  the word ` jew ' is n't offensive * in itself * and nobody has suggested it is . 
  the fact that you bring that up says quite a lot about you . 
  nah , they were still on the side of the angels at the time of the revolution . 
  it was only afterwards that they copied the perfidious frogs . 
  more natural . 
   * the shelf being in the front so that you pee on it while the hole is in the back ? 
  * yes , that 's it . 
  horrifying . 
   * they are quite rare * i 've seen 4 different kinds of wc in germany . 
  the standard , water-filled wc found in here in the uk ; the horrible squat-hole usually reserved for french campsites ; the poo shelf ; and the reverse poo shelf . 
  i think any nation so confused about its toilets has a fundamental problem . 
   * economic growth is basically the increase in goods and services produced in a country over a period of time * no it is n't . 
  it 's increase in the * value * of goods and services . 
  that 's why the impossible hamster betrays a fundamental , schoolboy error . 
  we can increase growth while * decreasing * resource consumption . 
  first , you may not have given it enough time ; second , you do n't have the counterfactual - what might have happened otherwise ; third , the level of expenditure differs from labour 's plans by what amounts to a rounding error . 
  now what were you saying , again ? 
   * i 'm simply presenting a belief than many americans ( and brits ) hold : that the united kingdom is more similar to the united states than to continental europe * that is incoherent . 
  continental europe is n't one homogeneous lump , all sharing in some mysterious ` europeaness ' the uk 's lacking . 
  how similar are sweden and italy ? 
  greece and estonia ? 
  the uk 's been firmly european from prehistoric times . 
  our language is germanic , we used to rule and lay claim to large parts of france , after we were invaded by french normans who became british who had defeated the once-germanic english . 
  i 've worked in paris and brussels and i 've travelled and holidayed in sweden , norway , estonia , denmark , germany , switzerland , austria , the netherlands , belgium , france , spain , italy , luxembourg , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , croatia and hungary . 
  and andorra . 
  i 've also visited washington state , oregon , california , idaho , nevada , arizona , montana , wyoming , colorado , new mexico , kansas , nebraska , south dakota , mississippi , arkansas , tennessee , louisiana , alabama , georgia , kentucky , south carolina , north carolina , virginia , west virginia and dc . 
  i know and love the us ; and know and love continental europe . 
  but the uk is firmly european . 
  believe me . 
   * do n't belittle me for merely attempting to come up with a rationalization for another person 's comment * if the ` rationalisation ' is nothing of the sort then i certainly will . 
  you 're mind-reading ? 
  you 're * chanelling * [ ** tony ** ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/tony_bruguier ) perhaps ? 
  * the uk is not in europe in the sense that some on this side of ` the pond ' consider it the 51st state ? 
  * that 's as stupid and incoherent a remark as i 've read for a long time . 
   * huh ? 
  neither russia nor the uk are in europe * eh ? 
  in what sense is the uk not in europe ? 
   * i did n't want to deal with the american bureaucracy and tsa * 5 mins filling in the esta visa form online ; tsa queue at the airport just like any other country . 
  no problem . 
   * just another reason not to fly to the states * and lots of good reasons to fly . 
  which is why i went last year and why i 'm going this . 
  very nice people , americans . 
   * then that 's a rather special way of having a constitution in my humble opinion * yes , we do have a rather special sort of constitution . 
  it 's evolved over a long , long time - back to the magna carta at least . 
  as with a lot of evolved things it 's quite well-adapted although you would n't have designed it like that from scratch . 
  a bit like the eye . 
  but i 'm buggered if i 'm going to let you fiddle with my eyes because you have a whizzy idea for rearranging my retina , and similarly i 'm not terribly keen on someone mucking about with a finely-tuned constitution . 
   * i still believe that all the cuts in their severity ( and the general drive to put important government duties in private corporate hands ) are not good - not for society , and probably also not for the economy in the long run . 
  * the problem with labour is that they 're cold-weather keynesians only . 
  when times are tough they 're keen on public sector spending ; but when times were good they did n't do the other part of the deal . 
  they did n't run large budget surpluses ; and this is the * political * reality of the centre-left , whatever the economic advice . 
   * which basically means cutting everything as much as possible * we have an enormous debt . 
  the outgoing labour chief secretary to the treasury left a message for his successor that read ` dear tories , sorry we spent all the money '' . 
  and contrary to your bizarre claim , defence is being cut : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16950709  * a nation without a real constitution * we do have a constitution . 
  we do n't have a single document called ` the constitution ' . 
   * i 'm actually a fan of gb ( having lived there for a while ) * do n't know much about it , do you ? 
  what is rotten ? 
  or for white african americans ... 
   * you then based your assumption that he is/was an anti semite on that ( completely incorrect fact ) . 
  * in fact i based my * presumption * on the fact that he volunteered to fight for the nazis . 
  good enough for me . 
   * try to make the argument about me * have a quck glance back through your silly remarks about me . 
    * yes . 
  well . 
  fortunately germany lost the war *  * what does that has to do with grass , anti semitism or anything * you cited the voting age in germany to me when i was in fact talking about the age of criminal responsibilty in the uk . 
   * he , legally and morally was a child * not according to the laws of the country that won the war . 
  of course , in the laws of germany , only some 17 year-olds were children , were n't they ? 
  others were shipped off the concentration camps and death camps and murdered . 
   * voting age * i did n't introduce voting age . 
  you did , it 's an irrelevance you introduced . 
   * criminal responisibity * younger than 18 years old in my country . 
   * so , why did you wrote `` he volunteered to join the waffen ss '' . 
  * he volunteered to join the military of fascist germany just 6 months before the end of the war - something you 've denied , incidentally - and i am not convinced he could n't have avoided being in the ss if he 'd wanted . 
   * you do n't even know there 's a difference between fascism and nazism * well ... i 'm well aware of the origins of fascism ( and indeed the * fasces * ) but you 're surely not trying to deny nazi germany was fascist ? 
  are you ? 
  how much of an apologist * are * you for nazi germany ? 
  i feel a little sick . 
   * in most of the world , no !, 
  most of the world , including germany * yes . 
  well .
