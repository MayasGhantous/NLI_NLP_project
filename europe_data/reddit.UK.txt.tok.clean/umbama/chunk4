  lots - relatively - following a long conversation with an old estonian in a museum in tallinn and a chat with some ethnic russian kids bunking off school at the song grounds . 
  so : endless back and forth between germany and russia / soviet union , to the point where estonians hated the nazis and the soviets about equally . 
  a third of the population ( ? ), 
  forcibly removed to siberia . 
  tv from finland during cold war . 
  the singing revolution . 
  speedily into high tech . 
  very young prime minister ( president ? ) . 
  economically , a bit of a miracle . 
  interesting experience , standing in a russian orthodox church service . 
  very cold in winter , when i visited . 
   * europol , for some reason , have not counted them , i highlighted what the report stated * obviously the report ca n't be trusted then , can it . 
  i raise a good point ? 
  you wrote :  * stats on terrorism in europe . 
  i was shocked to find out of 219 failed , foiled or completed attacks in 2012 only six were found to be religiously inspired * and this is obviously not true . 
  the arrests i mentioned were in connection with foiled plots . 
  that 's one of your categories . 
  you have n't counted them . 
   * out of 219 failed , foiled or completed attacks in 2012 only six were found to be religiously inspired * * 2012 june : five muslims plotted to bomb an english defence league rally in dewsbury but arrived late and were arrested when returning to birmingham . 
  a sixth was also convicted * london 2012 : two muslim converts arrested over olympic terror plot * 05 jul 2012 white muslim convert richard dart and a former police community support officer were among six people arrested for allegedly plotting a terror attack in britain . 
  * six would-be terrorists were ` not on radar ' of security services  * `` we have heard and seen you openly insulting the final messenger of allah ... * http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/30/six-wouldbe-terrorists-not-on-radar * 30 april 2012 | four british terror suspects ` plotted to use little toy car to attack territorial army base in luton ' suspects accused of taking lead from al qaeda magazine called ` inspire ' i gave up when i got to 5 in the uk in 2012 alone because i presumed your 6th must be somewhere else in europe . 
  where was that ? 
  i 'm a bit puzzled by your suggestion these occurred in northern ireland though . 
  how would you account for that discrepancy , would you say ? 
  and where * was * this 6th ? 
   * i 'm questioning whether violent and organized islamism exists in the extent you and anti-jihadists claim * to what extent have i claimed it exists ? 
  where have i made such a claim ? 
  oh i know . 
  you 're pulling that out of your capacious arse . 
  the original comment to which i was responding was hoping that muslims would n't become the next jews of europe . 
  jews were n't the targets of antisemitism and pogroms because of the king david hotel or because of anything that 's happened since . 
  it may be news to you but jews have been persecuted in europe for a long , long time - and not because of anything they did . 
   * elders of zion were facts in early 20th century europe , just like the violent nature of islam and the eurabia conspiracy are considered to be in some circles today * er ... elders of zion was a complete fabrication . 
  perhaps you 've missed the fact that violent islamism actually exists . 
   * stick to real arguments , please . 
   * the vast majority of muslims would never do anything like this * of course . 
   * the jews were n't accused of terrorism * forget the accusations ... they did n't * do * anything in the name of their religion . 
  that 's why i 'm bemused by the analogy . 
   * your analogy just does n't hold water * i did n't make any analogy . 
  i made no analogy at all . 
  the person i was responding to made the analogy . 
  i pointed out it made no sense whatsoever . 
  you 're being too hyper-pc here . 
  the jews who used to go around bombing and killing civilians ? 
  what * are * you on about ? 
  i did a project on it when i was about ... let me see ... 7 or 8 . 
  the danube . 
  i remember something about the danube . 
  and then there are those crazy close harmony singers . 
  er ... that 's it . 
  well , better stop that then . 
  really ? 
  that so ? 
  so what was the excuse for 9/11 ? 
  religion can sometimes be used as a proxy for race , and vice versa , it 's true : but i do hope the mods here are very , very careful about censoring any veiws about religion . 
  religions are ideologies , assertions about the world and prescriptions for behaviour that should be open to challenge , argument , debate and , yes , abuse . 
  it 's absolutely right that i should abuse fascism as an ideology and the morons who decide fascism is a neat idea . 
  the same goes for a religion that 's homophobic , discriminates against women , and so on . 
  feel free to espouse those ideas and i 'll feel free to insult you . 
  * if all mankind minus one were of one opinion , and only one person were of the contrary opinion , mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he , if he had the power , would be justified in silencing mankind *, 
  yeah , true , they screwed up their ability to beat-up the west some time after lepanto , did n't they ? 
   * atrocities carried out by christians/white people * a significant difference that you 're ignoring , conveniently , because it does n't suit your narrative , is that western countries or individuals who kill people are n't doing it * in the name of a religion * . 
  not all stereotypes are unfounded . 
  why would disliking a religion be counted by you as * racism * ? 
   * evidence should come first , then policy ( and politics ) * but before evidence you have to have general principles . 
  and obviously that 's going to push you in a direction when you 're looking for evidence . 
  choudary has praised the 9/11 and 7/7 terrorists . 
  he 's launched and been involved with several banned organisations . 
  he contributes to a forum that hosts recordings of bin laden , al zawahiri and omar bakri mohammed . 
  he has said :  * at the end of the day innocent people -- when we say ` innocent people ' we mean muslims -- as far as non-muslims are concerned they have not accepted islam and as far as we are concerned that is a crime against god . 
  * so i 'm wondering : why do you think he puts forward cogent views and is n't in some way responsible for radicalising and incitement ? 
  it 's completely unclear because you 've repeatedly turned my very specific question about ripping up the koran into a general ` provoke ' , probably because you do n't like to admit that ripping up the koran was a factor in his arrest which means that your law is now taking into account the specifically religious sensibilities of a minority group 's view of blasphemy . 
  but i 'm very interested here . 
  are you saying all i have to do to be arrested is ` provoke ' someone ? 
  what would the nature of that provocation have to be ? 
  did you read to the end of that article ? 
  seems to support gove 's concerns . 
  what evidence do you think gove is ignoring ? 
  so , would he have been arrested if he had n't ripped up the koran ? 
  i 'm not sure why this is such a difficult question for you . 
  of course you may not know the answer and it 's fine to say that . 
  cue . 
  not queue . 
   * they are plagued by substance abuse * if i am infected with the plague bacillus it 's none of my doing . 
  if i abuse drugs are n't i in some way culpable ? 
  are n't you removing agency from them , infantilising them , denying them the fact of being free adult human beings ? 
  are n't you being racist ? 
  i did n't ask what would have happened to him if he 'd only ripped the koran ( and i find your ` most likely ' extremely revealing ) . 
  i asked , would he have been arrested and inmprisoned if * he had n't * . 
   * belgium news has said that it was because of his prior deeds * so ... would he have been arrested and imprisoned regardless of what he did with this koran ? 
  if i did n't i could choose not to eat there could n't i. 
  bit of a bubbleboy , are n't you, 
  what evidence do you think gove is ignoring ? 
  commission regulation ( ec ) 2257/94 : bananas must be `` free from malformation or abnormal curvature '' . 
  would have been nice if they 'd base policy on evidence in the first place , do n't you think ? 
  right ... so the problem specifically * today * is . . ? 
   * so i 've just removed myself from this subrddit * what a jolly good idea . 
  and * lol * to you too . 
  when you write something as obviously stupid as that , do n't you pause to wonder how you got to that point ? 
  nope , you 're committing a logical fallacy : roughly , the * fallacy of division * : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fallacy_of_division if the fault is multiculturalism , you reason , it must be the fault of individuals in the culture .
