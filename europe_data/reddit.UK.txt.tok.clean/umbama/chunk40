  fortunately germany lost the war . 
  incidentally , you 've linked to something about voting age , not the age of criminal responsibility . 
  almost as if you 're very , very thick . 
   * i am being obtuse * indeed you are . 
   * are you saying that in most countries in the world 17 year olds are allowed to vote * nope . 
  never said that now did i ? 
  presumably you 're throwing that in as a red herring because you 've been caught being stupid again . 
  i clearly said there are many meanings of the word ` child ' and that under uk law a 17 year-old in the uk is held to be criminally responsible and is tried as an adult . 
  you found that difficult to understand , obviously . 
  is it any better for you now ? 
   * you ca n't even tell the difference between the navy and the waffen ss * nope , i can thanks . 
  grass volunteered to fight for the fascist , racist state , for hitler , only 6 months before the war ended . 
  then he shut up about it for 50 years while parading a moral superiority over others . 
   * well , most countries in the world do . 
  the uk , germany etc * you 're being obtuse . 
  if my child were 70 and i 90 , he 'd still be my child : but you 're using ` child ' to absolve grass of moral responsibility . 
  as a matter of fact - and again , these facts keep getting in the way of your attempts to excuse him - a ` child ' of 17 in the uk * is * legally responsibly for his criminal activitiy . 
  a 17 year-old would be tried as an adult . 
   * so , legally , and in the eyes of most people ( apart from you who ... * you 're simply wrong as a matter of fact . 
  that 's right : [ i wrote here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/s6jzg/nobel_laureate_banned_from_israel_over_critical/c4c4wle ) that he 'd volunteered for the military . 
  i wrote :  * ... * ** volunteering ** * for ( not being forced into ) the german military right * and you [ replied here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/s6jzg/nobel_laureate_banned_from_israel_over_critical/c4c50gi ) :  * he did n't volunteer * so , as i said , he * volunteered * to join the military in november 1944 . 
  now i think he should have refused to join the waffen ss in one way or another ; but leaving that aside for a moment : what do * you * make of someone * volunteering * to fight for the nazi state in november 1944 ? 
   * you have not addressed the fact that he was a child * he was 17 . 
  you can call him a child if you wish ; i would n't . 
  the salient fact is , did he have any moral responsibility for his actions then ? 
  i think he did . 
    * volunteering ( not being forced ) for the german military right *  * he did n't volunteer , which other people have showed you , with links , but you is completely ignoring this fact * sigh . 
  [ in november 1944 , shortly after his seventeenth birthday , he volunteered for submarine service with the kriegsmarine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%bcnter_grass )  * should run away and instead risk being caught and shot ? 
  * yes , exactly . 
  it 's what ratzinger did . 
  better that than fight for the nazi state . 
   * your arguments are false , and you are ignoring facts * you are the one who seems to have a significant problem reading and understanding , from the very first line of your reply . 
  i 'd give up if i were you . 
  i think you 're a little dim . 
  er ... what a very odd response . 
  let me try again , for hard of thinking . 
  grass is presumptively an antisemite for : + ** volunteering ** for ( not being forced into ) the german military right towards the end of the war + for joining the waffen ss and for not attempting to run away + and for then guiltily keeping mum about it for half a century we have many counter examples that demonstrate very clearly that none of these things * had * to happen . 
  the current pope is just one notable such example . 
  so grass is in a difficult position subsequently . 
  our presumption , as i say , is that he 's antisemitic ; and his attack on israel but no other of the many countries around the world who are far , far worse in many , many ways underline the presumption . 
  and if you do n't like ad hominems , just tell me the facts about israel ; do n't tell me that grass has written a poem . 
   * what does the pope has to do with anything ? 
  is that your argument * he was also german , 17 , drafted into the military . 
  he ran away . 
   * that he is an anti semite * he volunteered to fight for the nazi state led by hitler . 
  how much more evidence do you need ? 
   * yeah , obviously we germans know shit about germany and ww2 * no , i 'm sure you know lots . 
  there 's the list of concentration camps i passed every day last week outside the u-bahn station in berlin , sure you know about those . 
  there 's sachsenhausen , which i visited , you must know about that . 
  then there are the stolpersteines all over the place . 
  and the holocaust memorial just down from the brandenburg gate - was n't too impressed with that , actually . 
  such great reasons to enlist and fight for the nazis . 
  pleased to see you 've learned so much from your history . 
  yup . 
   * not really good for shooting at civilians . 
  this also was in 1944 til the end , while defending germany . 
  * and he would n't have had a gun , as foreign troops invaded germany then . 
   * one could blame you for the iraq war and afghanistan in general , and abu graib in particular * happy to defend all three , actually . 
   * it did not work for millions . 
  ratzinger also was drafter as luftwaffenhelfer and only fled after hitler was dead . 
  * and he did flee . 
   * the only jews grass might have killed were pilots trying to firebomb german cities * no ground troops ? 
  no civilian resistance or runaway prisoners ? 
  really ? 
  you know this do you ? 
  and troops being fungible , his participation allowed others to man the gas chambers , did n't it . 
   * or would you try to flee ? 
  at the age of 17 , in the final stage of ww2 ? 
  * probably flee . 
  it seemed to work for ratzinger did n't it ? 
   * maybe to defend his home country , maybe because submarines are so cool tech . 
  he said he wanted to get away from home . 
  * yeah ... get away from home by joining the army of a fascist state in its ongoing bid to dominate europe and ... * kill all jews * ... 
  same age as pope benedict . 
  what did he do i wonder ... ? 
  if you read the paragraph , dimbo , you 'll see it admits that even at the very end of the war grass * volunteered * to serve in the military ; and then he was ` called up ' to the ss . 
  i do n't see that as being obliged to join the ss . 
  it does n't say he was conscripted into the ss . 
  you have a reading problem ? 
  he was n't forced to join the ss . 
   * and yes , it is an ad hominem argument . 
  * i did n't say it was n't . 
  i said it was n't invalid . 
  if you had an understanding of logic that extends beyond reddit forums you might appreciate that ad hominems are n't always invalid . 
  i 'm not presenting a formal syllogism : i 'm suggesting that given his past as a nazi and given his attack only on israel when there are plenty of other countries to have a go at , it might be worth considering his motivation . 
  he volunteered for the ss, 
   * the link between ss and assumed antisemitism ... * ` assumed ' ? 
  how much more evidence of antisemtism could you possibly ask for than membership of the waffen ss ? 
  * jeez * . 
  it is n't an invalid ad hominem to point out he was a nazi . 
  it 's relevant information . 
  it 's relevant when considering either residual antisemitism still informing his views , or simply the appropriateness of a former antisemite weighing in in this issue alone . 
  assertion ? 
  it 's a fact . 
  how about , then , that this partisan attack against israel ( nobody else worse in the world to write about ? ), 
  comes from an ex member of the ss ? 
  i think an ex-member of the ss having a bash at israel is n't being above anything very much . 
   * so there are elections in syria as well ? 
  because that 's what assad claims . 
  * interestingly , you throw in a complete red herring .
