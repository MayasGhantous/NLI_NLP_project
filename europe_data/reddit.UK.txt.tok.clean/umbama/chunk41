  the issue is socialism in the ddr and other eastern bloc countries . 
   * the workers did not constitute the party * i did n't say it did . 
  another red herring . 
   * you 've never read a single book about socialism . 
  * ... and that 's enough for me . 
   * you tried to show that there were elections in gdr ( there were n't ) * yes there were . 
  you 're just wrong , and weirdly wrong as it 's an easy thing to check . 
   * here was worker 's control of the means of production ( there was n't ) * depends what you mean by workers ' control : if the workers constituted the party and the party controlled the means of production , you can argue that 's a form of workers ' control . 
  and that is of course what the eastern bloc countries argued . 
   * ( mis - ) reading a couple of wikipedia articles . 
  * again with the patronising . 
  the wikipedia articles are convenient references as i ca n't actually post you a physical book or take you with me to berlin , from where i 've just returned . 
   * and what that had to do with anything * you 're getting close to the * no true scotsman * argument again ...  * i would also appreciate , if you are to give any more replies , if they can be coherent . 
  wikipedia copy-pasting is not . 
  * stop being so patronising . 
  my point , clearly , is that socialism as implemented everywhere led to oppression and totalitarianism ; that it is a necessary consequence of the efforts to create socialism because it necessarily destroys freedom . 
   * no true scotsman is a logical fallacy by which an individual attempts to avoid being associated with an unpleasant act by asserting that no true member of the group they belong to would do such a thing . 
  * http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman, 
   * voting in east germany was relatively simple . 
  to vote yes , a voter simply took the ballot paper , which contained only one name -- that of the approved candidate -- and dropped it into the voting box . 
  a voter could vote against the candidate by crossing out his or her name *, 
   * the workers had no saying in the means of production * yes they did . 
   * i think it 's obvious * it clearly is n't : so your thinking is empirically rather flawed here . 
  you and i both know many , many people * did * consider the ddr socialist . 
  it 's a question that needs to be properly considered , not just dismissed by * your thinking it obvious * . 
   * under a dictatorship , the actual political system is nepotism , cronyism and corruption , laced together * agreed . 
  and that 's what the socialist countries gave us . 
  you 're in danger of a * no true scotsman * position here . 
  they ca n't be socialist because socialist ca n't be that . 
  but the fact of the matter is that they espoused socialism , taught socialism , organised according to principles of socialism and they were corrupt , an obvious consequence of socialism . 
   * being a dictatorship pretty much invalidates everything else * why ? 
  yes , they were dictatorships . 
  they were also socialists . 
  what was it about them that makes you claim they were n't ? 
  state-owned industry with centralised planning and price-setting , guaranteed welfare benefits including jobs , called itself socialist . 
  they were socialist . 
  in what way were n't they ? 
  except none of this happened in countries where it was tried . 
   * the idea that providing people with security will cause epidemics of laziness is absurd . 
  * it is n't ` absurd ' . 
  you may try to claim it is n't the case that people respond to incentives and i could just ignore you as a halfwit . 
   * socialism is a step forward from that * i 've just returned from berlin . 
  you say that socialism was a step forward ? 
  really ? 
  you know , do n't you , that nobody was shot trying to get from west to east ? 
   * we find a clear trend decline in the percentages of people below each of the international poverty lines * [ world bank , absolute poverty measures for the developing world , 1981-2004 ] ( http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/wdscontentserver/wdsp/ib/2007/04/16/000016406_20070416104010/rendered/pdf/wps4211.pdf )  * we find that 25 % of the population lived in poverty in 2005 , as judged by what `` poverty '' typically means in the world 's poorest countries . 
  this is higher than past estimates . 
  substantial overall progress is still indicated -- the corresponding poverty rate was 52 % in 1981 * [ http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/125/4/1577.short] ( http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/125/4/1577.short ) [ chinese lifespan ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;idim=country:chn&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=china+lifespan ) [ nigerian lifespan ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;idim=country:chn&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=china+lifespan#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:nga&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en ) learn to use google yourself, 
   * no need to develop labour-saving technology when there was an abundance of slave * those are ... * slaves * ...  * as it is often cheaper to use sweatshop labour than to invest in automation research * again with the claim . 
  why do you claim this ? 
   * as work is automated , the wages are lowered due to the unemployment * but wages and the standard of living are * increasing * . 
  but you 're just making a claim without any evidence or argument . 
  why should we ever reach such an equilibrium ? 
  that 's never happened before - what 's the mechanism whereby innovation and mechanisation will be guaranteed never to deliver productivity improvement ? 
  [ indeed i do ] ( http://www.google.com ), 
   * the laws of physics are the same for capitalists as they are for socialists . 
  * not according to a book i once read by stalin . 
  not according to lysenko . 
   * capitalism will become a fetter on technology * i do n't understand . 
  you 're just throwing out a claim ... i could throw out the claim that mice will shortly take to the air using balloons . 
  are n't you obliged to argue your claim a little before asking me to engage with it ? 
   * but how do you now separate technology from capitalism ? 
  there is no doubt that capitalism has been an improvement over feudalism in its use of technology and increase in productive capacity . 
  * well we have a good example in the case of the soviet union . 
  over its history its gdp increase was attributable entirely to increased resource consumption . 
  over the same period gdp increase in the west os only 20 % attributable to increased resources consumption - and a whacking 80 % to total factor productivity . 
   * the availability of desperate cheap labour acts against further investment in automation * the chinese are 10 times richer today than they were 50 years ago . 
  the facts belie your claims . 
  certainly . 
   * between 1980 and 2000 , the poor doubled their consumption . 
  the chinese are ten times richer and live about 25 years longer than they did 50 years ago . 
  nigerians are twice as rich and live nine more years . 
  the percentage of the world 's people living in absolute poverty has dropped by over half . 
  the united nations estimates that poverty was reduced more in the past 50 years than in the previous 500 *, 
  that is n't an argument for or against equality : it 's an argument against the possibility of a patterned income distribution being compatible with freedom . 
   * would not lead to the great poverty and economic crises that exist today * capitalism and globalised free trade has led to the greatest reduction in poverty and the greatest decrease in income disparity we 've ever seen . 
  i have the figures . 
  what are you talking about ? 
   * no communist or socialist would argue against voluntary , mutually beneficial trade * yes they would . 
  nozick 's wilt chamberlain argument , for example . 
  hmmm ... a german accusing me of arrogance . 
  there 's a novelty . 
  fair enough . 
  i have only been there for a few days . 
  yeah . 
  non-standard english grammar from mr marley there . 
  i 'm just saying the croatians i met were not nice people . 
  have n't had that problem anywhere else in europe , except for paris a bit . 
  obviously you 're croatian and your response to my observation kinda underlines it , does n't it . 
   * i recommend the phrase `` who the cap fit , let them wear it '' . 
  * i recommend you learn some english grammar before you start recommending phrases . 
   * cockney and scots , which , as i gather , are at least mutually intelligible * ... * and * ... wrong again . 
  each to his own . 
   * brits are culturally way more coherent than the citizens of what 's nowadays germany * possibly true . . and it is exactly the point i was making when i wrote :  * and for countries with more natural boundaries ... * is n't it . 
  so i 'm sort of failing to see your point . 
  look , bavarians may well be substantially different in outlook , character , religion and habits than , say berliners : but they also share quite a lot in common . 
  i do n't need to tell you how a language binds you together , especially a language not spoken much in the rest of the world in comparison to , say , english or chinese . 
  it seems needless to say it but i 'm going to say it : there are many dimensions of comparison . 
  on some - say , social liberality - berliners may be closer to londoners than either are to rural parts of their respective countries . 
  but the grouping by country or state , finally , weighted along certain axes or by more points of comparison is n't arbitrary or accidental .
