  except i have nowhere said there is no difference between england , scotland and wales . 
  in fact i have explicitly stated that there are differences - not that it needs stating , of course . 
  so either you have to lie stupidly to make your foolish point - possible - or you hold that idiotic view yourself - also possible . 
  yes , exactly . 
  rhetorical , not requiring an answer from me and so being a statement of * your view * . 
  so as i said . 
  how very peculiar of you to think it . 
   * so , there 's no difference between scotland , england and wales , then ? 
  * do you think not ? 
  i think there is ... not that those units are homogenous . 
  coming from south wales myself . 
  do n't know why you 'd think that . 
  how very peculiar of you . 
  the most unfriendly people i ever met were in croatia . 
  dear america , the nicest , most polite people i 've ever met have been in the us - from the young boy in dc who held the door open for my gf and who , when thanked , said , * `` you 're welcome ma'am '' * to the pleasant and helpful hotel staff everywhere , to the farmers in the bar in williams , az , who bought us drinks , to the okie family i chatted to in denver , to the two girls on the beach in eureka , the fantastic rangers everywhere ... the list goes on and on and on . 
  your country is also very beautiful . 
  good . 
  german still works . 
  i 'm over in berlin next week ... 
   * define \u201e germaness '' * i do n't need to . 
  if you do n't understand what i mean i invite you to read a book , [ ** browse the web ** ] ( http://bit.ly/h3xqxa ) , or go to school . 
  this faux innocence of yours is fucking irritating . 
   * or ireland . 
  oh wait * i suppose you believe yourself to be making some salient point . 
  ca n't for the life of me think what it could be  * scottish secessionists and uk unionists read the same history to find arguments for their respective positions * neither would deny aspects of shared culture . 
  i 'm not suggesting for a moment that a certain scottish identity does n't exist - and in making the claim yourself you 're rather supporting my original position although you 're presumably too dim to see it . 
  neither the scot nor the englishman would think himself spanish . 
  or german . 
  it 's not really nitpicking . 
  english as a second language for a german , for example , usually indicates very high proficiency , meaning that using english as a * lingua franca * across europe would n't be too painful . 
  if said german had learned french a a second language , italian as a third and then english , we might reasonably suppose that using english would be considerably more difficult . 
  and while i admire the language skills of my continental friends you have to admit there 's a world of difference between your favoured second language and the third or fourth you pick up ? 
  asserting english is the most widely spoken language is not the same thing as asserting that english is the most widely spoken 2nd language . 
  or do n't they do logic in germany anymore ? 
  that table , in fact , does n't tell you anything at all about the 2nd language . 
  it does n't use that term . 
  it give the figure for ** an ** * additional * language which could be the 3rd , 4th , 5th tongue . 
  as i said : the figure for the 2nd language would be relevant . 
   * i have never commented code in swedish * what about your variables and your function names ? 
  and the most widely spoken 2nd language ? 
  that 's rather relevant is n't it . 
   * it 's easy to swear in , but that 's about it * such self-hatred . 
  easy to swear in * and that 's it * to describe the language of shakespeare , donne , milton , wordsworth , auden , eliot , larkin . 
  pfffft . 
  oh this is such balls . 
  if germany as a state has n't existed very long that does n't mean that * germaness * has n't existed for very long ; and for countries with more natural boundaries - like the uk , perhaps - there 's no question of the state being some recent , artifical construct . 
  it 's organic , it 's grown and changed slowly over time , we have a shared history and pride and obligations and shame that 's * not * similarly shared by every other country . 
  such unrealistic twaddle . 
  meh , there was n't really a coherent ` france ' . 
  he came from normandy , he spoke early french , he was descended from vikings who 'd settled there not too much earlier . 
  i 'd stop arguing the point if i were you . 
  you claimed they were franks . 
  young , disaffected muslims with otherwise boring or failing lives who become entranced with a fundamentalist islamism ? 
   * can you link two people who have done something like this to any sort of demographic * it is n't just 2 . 
  and i can because of their * own professed intentions and ideologies * . 
  it 's more elliptical , more hinting , more suggestive . 
   * it 's fallacious and based on assumptions * you have n't done logic , have you ...  * do n't present it like the ultimate truth * yup . 
  did n't do that . 
  look what i 've just found :  * fascism is not suitable to england . 
  in italy there was a long history of secret societies . 
  in germany there was a long tradition of militarism . 
  neither had a sense of humour . 
  in england anything on these lines is doomed to failure and ridicule . 
  i worked with a greek recently for a year or so . 
  he was quite a cross sort of a person . 
  are you guys all like that , * spearthruster * ? 
  ( i say * you guys * because of course you 're all greek really ... although it 's sweet macedonia pretends it 's a country ) . 
   * and even dated an educated gal , yet your viewpoint is conservative * i see . 
  you 're just an idiot . 
  oh , i 'm being silly , i * really * like germany - i 'm off to visit berlin again at easter , have n't been there for about 10 years , be nice to see it again . 
  and i 've driven all over . 
  i have fond memories of heidelberg and freiburg and cologne and nuremberg and all of bavaria ( been up the zugspitze ) and lindau ... and the people are really friendly . 
  but i really have to say that if you had to choose a single european city it might have to be rome . 
  completely agree with you about parisians , 
  besides , you used to be in charge of us . 
  canute ( cnut ) was danish was n't he . 
   * rome 's streets are n't very clean * they 're absolutely fine . 
  i was there again in december . 
  no problem whatsoever . 
   * and it has only two metro lines , so not a great public transport system * you probably do n't mind sitting in trains in tunnels in munich , it 's true . 
  in rome you 'll * want * to walk everywhere . 
  really , munich does n't compare . 
  i was there a few years back and a hugely unfriendly guy in the * residenz * tried to stop me taking photos . 
  apart from the area around marienplatz there 's not * that * much , is there ? 
  rome ... miles of millenia of history . 
   * they were descended from the franks * clue : norman = = norse man http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rollo, 
   * ... has english had an extremely significant impact * right ... so defeating napoleon was forgotten pretty quickly then ? 
  until you drive into switzerland and they sting you for their road pass . 
   * i see myself first as cornish * hard luck . 
  how is this 1 instance of 1 person ? 
  surely it 's * another * instance on at least 1 person ? 
   * it really does . 
  when i see uk parties like the bnp , what strikes me is not their sense of humor . 
  and if you understood the wodehouse you 'll have understood that nothing much has changed . 
   * which you would already know , had you been able to understand their language and cultures * i 've worked in paris and brussels , i 've traveled all over europe , i used to go out with a girl doing a degree at toulouse , i speak a bit of german too . 
   * to trust those nasty foreigners . 
  * and this is where your rhetoric gets you . 
  impugning me with your failings . 
  nice try . 
   * yes , we did .
