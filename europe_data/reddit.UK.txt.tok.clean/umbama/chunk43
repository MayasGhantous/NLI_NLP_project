  as europeans . 
  not brits specifically * that 's correct . 
  we brits did n't . 
   * but do n't you think it 's extremely na\u00efve to think that there is something inherent in british culture that prevents it from ever turning into the fascist regimes * no . 
  that would be one of my points . 
  there is something about british culture that would have made serious popular fascism impossible . 
  you wo n't get the reference but one only has to think of chaplin and * the great dictator * or wodehouse and roderick spode , his marvelous pisstake of oswald mosley :  * the trouble with you , spode , is that just because you have succeeded in inducing a handful of half-wits to disfigure the london scene by going about in black shorts , you think you 're someone . 
  you hear them shouting `` heil , spode ! '', 
  and you imagine it is the voice of the people . 
  that is where you make your bloomer . 
  what the voice of the people is saying is : `` look at that frightful ass spode swanking about in footer bags !, 
  did you ever in your puff see such a perfect perisher ? 
  '' * sense of humour . 
  it helps . 
   * it 's the notion that one culture or nation is inherently superior to another , * actually , no , that is n't what fascism is . 
  if you 're going to be so impolite as to try to correct me then why not get your bloody definition correct ? 
   * this rhetoric falls completely flat , when the uk ( together with denmark ) has consistently worked against indisputable improvements to the eu democracy , which you are completely right is severely lacking . 
  * that 's so incoherent i do n't know where to begin . 
   * but of course there 's still a long way . 
  * as i said . 
  we have a democracy , we do n't need the eu or any state in the eu to explain it to us . 
  thanks all the same . 
   * ethnic and national stereotypes are not something off which to base civil rights * i have n't suggested anything of the sort . 
   * but there 's a huge problem when you try to codify these things * nobody was trying to do that . 
   * when rights are assigned based on ethnicity or religion or something as fickle as traditions and customs * nobody was trying to do that . 
   * the entire point of european collaboration is to avoid going down that road ever again . 
  * we did n't go down that route . 
   * that 's why we must not view our nation states as anything but administrative units . 
  * excuse me , but someone from another country telling me i ** must ** not view the uk as anything other than an ` administrative unit ' seems rather like the fascism you claim you 're trying to avoid . 
  i think of my country , warmly , and with some amusement , as my home and the source of a great deal of fine traditions , with a history somewhat mixed , as is the case with most countries , but on the whole a place to feel rather pleased about . 
  i am not going to be told off by someone else for that . 
   * but they must reflect the actual population , not the other way around . 
  that is democracy . 
  * yes , that 's fine , we are a democracy . 
  a better one than the bloody eu . 
   * it is not by any means a reliable descriptor of any person belonging to that society * it 's true , in the main . 
  of course there are exceptions and nobody 's * forced * to adopt a love of cricket ; but love of cricket in europe will be strongly positively correlated with being english . 
  similarly afternoon tea - or just ` tea ' , full stop . 
  you 're tying yourself in knots to avoid the bleeding obvious just because you 'd prefer to think true facts about the world are n't true . 
  you should ask yourself why you need to do that . 
   * munich ( perhaps europe 's finest city ) * eh ? 
  well in what way do you go north , either ? 
  west all the way to fishguard ffs . 
  northern italy is lovely ( i only know down as far as rome so i 'm not dissing the south , just ca n't personally recommend it ) . 
  the towns - many old hill towns - are gorgeous ( venice is a weird exception to all of this - quite fantastic but try to go when it 's not too crowded ) ; the art , of course . 
  and the food is excellent . 
  and as a reserved brit i thought i would n't get on with loud , chattering fashion-obsessed italians ( black 's in , by the way , or was in december ) but really they 're very nice indeed . 
    * it describes the customs and traditions you grew up with and to some extent the shared values and mores of the people around you . 
  *  * in a free society , that is necessarily false . 
  * how is that ` false ' ? 
  i do share customs and traditions and values , it is n't a question of the degree of freedom , any more than my speaking the same first language as most of my fellow countrymen is a question of freedom . 
   * nationality is an illusionary attribute ( because it does n't describe anything ) * it describes the state that will tax you , that will provide you with benefits , that will allow you to vote for its legislators , that will offer you assistance when you 're abroad . 
  it describes the customs and traditions you grew up with and to some extent the shared values and mores of the people around you . 
  it describes the education you 'll have had and the history you share . 
  it describes the music and food you listen to and consume and the jokes you find funny . 
  which of these are illusory ? 
  ah ... now you 're talking about me , are n't you ; but if you recall - i understand the difficulty you have here - * i was talking about a greek person 's claim of that for greece * . 
   * a study by forensic accountants has found that data submitted by greece to eurostat had a statistical distribution indicative of manipulation *, 
  ` bear ' . 
  the word is ` bear ' . 
  so dim ... 
   * really ? 
  then read your comment below and try to understand what you are actually saying when you bring bring up trojan war and turkey . 
  * well , stupid , i was taking the piss out of the idiot who claimed that anyone in britain had no right to a view because of the history of the british empire . 
  fuck me you 're dumb . 
   * you would have also heard how europe ( eu ) was well aware of this fact . 
  * that exculpates greece * how * , dimbo ? 
   * if you think that turkey had anything to do with the trojan war * i have n't said anything of the sort . 
  really , why not talk about what i am saying rather than what 's in your slightly feverished imagination ? 
   * you can judge others but not hold yourself accountable * yes , i can judge others . 
  indeed . 
   * greece informed the eu and eurostats regarding the statistics * and greece lied . 
  you 're not actually trying to dispute this fact are you ? 
  you doubt ... what ? 
  you did n't know about it until a few seconds ago . 
  have you really had the time to read up about it and consider the evidence ? 
   * the war in troy was a story written by homer . 
  * er ... it really happened ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trojan_war#historical_basis, 
  i did n't suggest you had to apologise to turkish interlopers . 
  rather , the descendents of the hittites , or whatever they were . 
   * you feel entitled because of the country you 're from * no , because of the decisions i 've made . 
  personally . 
   * apparently have little empathy for people in greece . 
  * i do . 
  i just do n't think that claiming greece is standing on its own two feet is an accurate description of load defaulting and bailout receiving . 
  do you ? 
  troy . 
  it was in modern-day turkey . 
  yup . 
  i understand you greeks went and destroyed a major non-greek city . 
  pretty big deal at the time . 
  have you apologised ? 
   * ` the greeks ' simply allowed the problems of their society to continue * indeed . 
  so they 're culpable ? 
   * just like basically all the other societies * well , no . 
  for example in the uk we 've had a very difficult time , very fractious , very divided , over trying to deal with the mess the previous government go us into : they were cold-weather keynesians who liked to spend in recession - which has some economic rationale to it - but did n't save during growth . 
  we 've voted in a government which is having to do quite a few unpleasant things to try to put us back on an even keel . 
  we do n't know yet if it 's going to work . 
  and : we did n't join the euro or lie about our economy to do it . 
  so , not like all other societies , no .
