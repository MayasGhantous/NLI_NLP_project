   * if you make a stupid investment , expect loss * fine . 
  now the rest of the world knows exactly what greeks think about debt obligations . 
   * you dont want the greeks to go all like ` your own fault , you should 've just done x ' . 
  * there 's a difference between - take your examples - having to deal with nuclear weapons and with power plants ; and with deliberately lying about your economy and running up unsustainable debt . 
  so that 's britain dealt with then . 
   * look how the scottish/irish love us * scots not part of british colonialism ? 
  what i ca n't understand - and please do help me here - is how greece 's lying about its economy to join the euro has anything to do with any of that . 
  incidentally , if we 're talking history , i think you greeks have some apologising to do to turkey re . 
  the trojan war . 
   * you are not in a position to judge others regarding their debts - until you start paying your debts * that 's actually not true . 
  i really do n't understand you . 
  nope , still not understanding you . 
  you wrote :  * the british forced the colonies they fucked and pillaged to `` loan '' them their wealth *, 
   * just like hitler did to greece in the 40s . 
  * what are you talking about ? 
   * the wages , benefits and rights of the population will be swiftly diminished * because greece ca n't afford them ? 
  _ but greeks continue to stand on their feet . 
  for that they should be respected . 
  '' _ well , that 's one way of describing not paying your debt . 
  gay civil partnerships , though . 
  soon to have gay marriage . 
  we have state-recognised gay civil unions : that 's just the same as portugal , is n't it ? 
  difference being , we have state-recognised marriages too . 
  but we 'll be introducing gay marriages soon . 
  big debate about it at the mo , our ( conservative ) pm supports it , it 's just the loony clerics kicking off . 
   * obama is so dignified he could be french * this is so wrong to all counts . 
  the french * dignified * ? 
  pompous , arrogant and * snooty * , yes . 
   * then there 's the cult of personality in u.s. politics that does n't exist in france * so much not a cult that de gaulle gave his name to a whole political movement . 
  oh i see ... the uk 's marked down for not having reference to sexual orientation and gender identity in the constitution . 
  that would be our largely unwritten constitution , would it ? 
  seems a tad unfair . 
  from the report . 
  it 's aggregating everything . 
   * the gender pay gap -- the average difference in gross hourly earnings between women and men across the economy as a whole * and from your own link :  * a high pay gap is usually characteristic of a labour market which is highly segregated ( e.g. 
  cyprus , estonia , slovakia , finland ) or * ** in which a significant proportion of women work part-time **, 
  such a rubbish stat . 
  for example ; + the figures are for average gross hourly pay and do n't compare like jobs + the figures mix pay in part-time and temporary work with pay in full-time : women work more in part-time and part-time tends to attract lower hourly pay + women take breaks from the labour force to raise children ; this interrupts their career progression in the uk various lobbying groups have been playing fast and loose with these figures even though they 've been told not to . 
  there may still be a small gender gap even after criticisms like these have been taken into account but it 's very difficult to tell when nonsense like this is peddled about . 
  [ edit well do n't just mark me down without explaining * why * ], 
  that 's ok . 
  pointless comments get mine . 
  nope, 
  you 're a bit dim , are n't you . 
  not myu comparison . 
  you brought up the nazis, 
  positive reasons given here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/qaz0z/uk_presses_for_european_human_rights_convention/c3wd9fc repeated for the hard of thinking : * if a criminal has proven himself , through his breaking the law , to be so beyond the pale that we find it necessary to deprive him of his liberty ; then we do not wish him to participate in electing people who make the laws he abuses . 
  * as a society , we wish to demonstrate to others the mutual , cooperative nature of our social contract ; that it is not a one-sided benefit to the criminal and obligation on the part of everyone else . 
   * a constructive discussion under rules of logic that make basic sense to me * like suggesting that i must be in favour of torture if i maintain that the current law should continue to apply ? 
  that sort of constructive discussion ? 
   * that was `` your response to someone 's question about why it was acceptable to deny a given right ( voting ) '' * yes . 
  and you took it to an absurdity by suggesting that was akin to allowing someone to be tortured . 
  and you pretended that was at all a reasonable question . 
   * you 've only repeated that since they lose some rights , they might as well lose some others , * no i have n't ; i 've suggested that the complaint they loose * some * rights is less coherent given that you 've already agreed to deprive them of their libery , their right to a family life , etc , etc. 
  i 've given * positive reasons * why i think they should n't be allowed to vote and you have n't attempted to engage with that . 
  instead you 've tried a childish , ' * well it must be ok to torture * ... ' i 'll draw you a diagram if it 's any easier for you . 
  true but a technicality ; the point remains because there are neverthless many people resident who can not vote . 
   * this was your response to someone 's question about why it was acceptable to deny a given right * no , it was my response to you asking :  * so does that mean we can also torture them * was n't it . 
  i mean , you can misrepresent the facts of the metter as much as you care to but one only has to look one response up in the thread to see how you 're lying ...  * in many countries people have been put in prison for violating laws mandating inferior treatment for certain races . 
  * and we 're talking about the uk , and the appropriate action would be to campaign against such laws . 
  no doubt on the planet thermidore they wear live argleflangers as shoes . 
   * the prisoner who votes for a politician who wants to legalize inter-race marriage just might have some impact . 
  * back to the planet thermidore again , i see . 
  it does n't mean that . 
  it means that : * if a criminal has proven himself , through his breaking the law , to be so beyond the pale that we find it necessary to deprive him of his liberty ; then we do not wish him to participate in electing people who make the laws he abuses . 
  * as a society , we wish to demonstrate to others the mutual , cooperative nature of our social contract ; that it is not a one-sided benefit to the criminal and obligation on the part of everyone else . 
  your question is childish . 
  i 'm reminded of elizabeth anscombe 's remark re . 
  the possibility of executing an innocent person :  * i do not want to argue with him ; he shows a corrupt mind *, 
   * the claim is n't that prisoners should be allowed to vote because they 're affected by the state * it was . 
  you wrote :  * as i replied before , prisoners more than almost anyone else are influenced by the state and as such who is in charge affects them hugely - why should n't they have a say in it ? 
  * remember ? 
   * there is no reason why denying them the right to vote should also be part of their punishment * well yes there is and i 've already presented you with one reason . 
  now you can chpoose to ignore it if you wish because it 's rather inconvenient to you but it 's a bit silly to claim there is ` no reason ' , is n't it . 
  perhaps you mean there 's no reason you agree with , even though you ca n't think up a reason why not just at the moment so you 'll igore it ? 
  let me go through some for you : * it would be inappropriate for people who have offended against the law in such a serious way that we find it necessary to deprive them of the fundamental right to liberty , to help decide who should be proposing and passing laws in government . 
  * depriving people temporarily of the right to vote is a proportionate way of indicating to a criminal that they have so offended against society that they shall for a period be semi-detached from that society . 
  * if a serious criminal has decided not to cooperate with society , we shall not cooperate with him , either . 
   * but it was n't based on a `` bill of rights '' , since we did n't really have one * apart from our bill of rights , do you mean ? 
   * i do n't like the eu as a whole , but i find the echr to be its most valuable single institution * how amusing . 
  you find the most valuable eu institution to be an institution which is not part of the eu . 
  this, 
   * on this side of the channel we remember the nazi occupation , when all the echr stands for was lost , so we 're quite happy with the existence of the echr . 
  if britain wants to live in splendid isolation * and on this side of the channel we do n't delude ourselves that the echr would have prevented hitler . 
   * prisoners would ordinarily have a say in the process as they are citizens . 
  non-citizens would n't . 
  * your argument was that prisoners should be allowed to vote because they 're ` influenced by the state ' . 
  the same goes for everyone living in the uk and many not living . 
  they 're not all able to vote . 
   * consequently may not feel that they have an investment in society as they have not had an influence in it . 
  * tough . 
  i do n't want people who have done something so serious that we consider it necessary to deprive them of something that you 'll surely agree is a more fundamental right - the right to liberty - to have a say in * laws * that a government proposes and passes . 
   * both the right to liberty and the right to family life have derogations within the convention which can allow imprisonment . 
  there is no similar derogation for the right to vote . 
  * and you 're getting confused between the current , highly artificial and strictly technical situation , which we can change , on the one hand ; and what is * right * on the other . 
  and you 're missing the point . 
  the claim being made is that the right to vote is a ` fundamental right ' and that prisoners should be allowed to vote because they 're ` affected by the state ' . 
  it 's an incoherent argument . 
  resident non-citizens ca n't vote and they too are ` affected by the state ' . 
  prisoners are deprived of their liberty and that 's a pretty fundamental right .
