   * they are fundamental rights of all people , unless you are suggesting that prisoners are not people then there is no reason to deny them their rights * you deny them many ` rights ' by locking them up . 
  you 've already accepted that . 
   * as i replied before , prisoners more than almost anyone else are influenced by the state and as such who is in charge affects them hugely - why should n't they have a say in it ? 
  * suggesting that because someone is affected by legislation * in itself * is a knock-down argument for that person having a say in that legislation simply wo n't wash . people living in the uk who are not citizens do n't have the right to vote , for example . 
   * excluding prisoners from voting will leave them without feeling any connection to society when they are released * perhaps you 're misunderstanding this . 
  they 're only excluded from voting * when in prison * you know , it seems very strange to me that you think the right to vote is inalienable ; but the right to liberty and a family life is n't . 
   * ut the brits think it 's ok take away such a fundamental right from prisoners as the right to vote ? 
  * yup . 
   * prominent greek economists * er...righty-ho ... bet they 'll be interesting on the matter . 
  but the * only * remark about exiting the euro in that article you 've linked to is this :  * an exit from the euro would be even more disastrous , since it could lead to hyperinflation and extremely high borrowing costs . 
  * ... could n't find something more , ooh , expansive , could you ? 
  no : because after a certain point the effort , the time , the money you spend are too much for the payoff . 
  it 's why we do n't all drive at 10mph . 
  but why have an uncosted , unassessed target ? 
  it may not be - in fact certainly is n't - desirable to hit it . 
   * so i do n't see here where anyone says `` at any cost '' * i think it 's implied in saying ` zero ' waste . 
  are you ? 
  did you downvote before asking the question ? 
  this is n't a question of absolutes . 
  a ` zero waste ' economy is , of course , a nonsensical piece of marketing ; but the idea that we should strive at all costs to cut down waste is daft because we do n't do anything * at all costs * . 
  so the point would be to balance the * cost * of having waste , and maybe paying to have it dealt with , to the * cost * of struggling not to produce it or to reuse it . 
  let me quote tim worstall , talking about ` zero waste scotland ' :  * for what they 're going to find is that , measured by how well we prevent the planet from burning up , we already recycle too much . 
  for example , we crush up green glass to be used as underlay for roads : this produces more co2 then simply dumping it . 
  dumping waste food underground and collecting the methane ( as we do at every landfill now ) produces fewer greenhouse gases than sticking it into a wormery : worms do that eructation thing you see , just with nox which is 10 times more polluting that methane . 
  *  * i 'm all in favour of doing the right things to reduce pollution : i 'm also all in favour of measuring properly what we 're actually doing *, 
  no , and nor should we try to . 
   * i 'll take that as you admitting that the invasion of the baltic states by the soviet union , and the english invasion of scotland , wales and ireland , are essentially the same thing * as i said , you 're a bit thick . 
  you 're getting very boring now . 
   * if i look at the map of the british isles circa 1400 * no . 
  wrong dates . 
  never mind . 
  you 're not going to learn , you do n't actually have any interest in british history ( and to be fair , why should you ) and you 're a bit thick . 
   * i see . 
  the british isles were uninhabited . 
  the roman empire had withdrawn from britain . 
  see , again you 're taking a brief wikipedia 's perusal in place of understanding . 
   * neither was latvia at the time when it was conquered by the soviet union * the fact that the constitution had been suspended does n't give legitimacy to a soviet takeover now , does it . 
   * but hey , let 's ignore the 500 years or murder , rape and pillage that preceeded that act , it 's your history * er ... ok  * the `` geographical area '' being scotland and ireland , with people living there , people that were murdered by these successive invasions . 
  * see , again . 
  you 're understanding of british history is so , so weak . 
  northumbria , mercia , east anglia , essex , kent , sussex , wessex , elmet , rheged , strathclyde , ebrauc , bryneich and gododdin ... all little kingdoms , all warring , all vying for power . 
  there were n't political entities ` scotland ' , ` ireland ' and ` england ' and ` britian ' . 
   * i 'm not going to answer to your sad attempts at trolling with recent events in hungary * no , i can see that might be an embarrassment . 
  an entire nation that desperate ? 
  your women must be awful . 
  are all bulgarians like you ? 
   * i go with your mather many times * you really should have seen my * mather * before you said that . 
  she 's obese and she 's not a looker . 
  the ` roman ' inhabitants had largely left by the time the saxons invaded . 
  and there was no political entity ` britain ' at the time . 
  and it was n't a democracy . 
   * just like how the scotts and irish willfully came under english rule * well , the scots signed an act of union , actually . 
  but the main point here is not to point out your ignorance of my country 's history ; but rather to point out that successive invasions of a geographical area before there was any cohesive nation and before there was any democracy is just not the same as a totalitarian state signing an agreement with fascists to ride roughshod over a democratic state . 
  and the fact that you ca n't see that , and that your only response is a badly-mangled version of british history and an utter blanking of the salience of democracy would n't trouble me too much if i did n't know about the history of and current political events in hungary . 
  when i visited the * szoborpark * there were more than a few people who seemed to treat the statues with a degree of wistful reverence . 
  you know , i do n't understand a word of that . 
  so ... you think that millenia of migration into an area that was n't a country , that was populated by numerous tribes who made no claim to the entire country , and which was n't governed by anything like a popular democracy ; you think that is equivalent to being occupied by a foreign power that ignored your democratically elected government , instead signing an agreement with the nazis ? 
  you think that 's similar , do you ? 
  then again , that sort of positive support for fascism and totalitarianism is rather popular in hungary these days , is n't it ? 
  they did in estonia , certainly, 
   * switzerland is not a country , either . 
  more like a money-laundering scheme * ha ha ha ha ha ... i 'm going to remember that one . 
  you do know how russians got there , do you ? 
  fail to see the sarcasm . 
  you said something . 
  i said you 'd said it . 
  you denied you 'd said it . 
  and that 's sarcasm in your book is it ? 
  you really are a bit dim , are n't you . 
  no , _ nazi _ is n't sensationalist . 
  calling people who are n't or were n't nazis in order to demonise them is sensationalist . 
   * it 's so uniquely sensationalist that ... * is english your first language ? 
  ah , sorry , it is n't is it . 
  ok , well , look : the word _ nazi _ in itself is n't derogatory . 
  applied to the nazis is a perfectly sensible description . 
  yes . 
  i 'm deducing that . 
  the map does n't * show * that . 
   * the fact that you care only about direction accuracy * i do n't . 
  i 've never said i did . 
  you 've made that up . 
  no idea why ; perhaps you 're dim , perhaps you ca n't argue without putting unfamiliar words into the mouths of other people . 
  i do n't really care though . 
   * n this map the scandinavian peninsula looks almost as much as large as the central european continent . 
  are you really ok with this ? 
  why ? 
  * absolutely . 
  i 'm not learning anything about the shape and size of scandinavia , but * possibly * concluding something about the directions people moved in . 
   * this map is supposed to show the movement of populations throughout the continent * no it is n't . 
  it 's supposed to show the current positions of haplotypes . 
  draw your own conclusions about movement , the map does n't provide that . 
  however , the fact that loxodromes are straight helps you think about population movements , i 'm sure you 'll agree . 
   * giving in to rather crude propaganda '' is not really an argument * , , , and was n't presented as an argument . 
  simply a statement of fact . 
   * where did i even mention envisaging `` threats '' * here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/pswym/british_tanks_to_be_sent_to_germany_for_storage/c3simde where you said :  * the same threats that informed the decision to buy these tanks in the first place ? 
  * you 're a bit of an idiot , are n't you . 
  a little learning is a dangerous thing . 
  why fixate on area-accuracy over shape-accuracy ? 
  mercator 's is fine for a relatively small portion of the glove in this circumstance . 
  i 'm afraid you 're giving in to rather crude propaganda .
