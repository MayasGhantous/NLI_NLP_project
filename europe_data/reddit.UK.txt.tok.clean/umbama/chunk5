  fallacy , pure and simple . 
  whereas your downvoters are n't being quite as dim . 
   * downvotes ? 
  so you guys think that we should put the blame on innocent people in addition to the actual criminals ? 
  * you said we should n't blame * multiculturalism * . 
  so people downvoting you are more than likely downvoting because they disagree with that appeal - not because they would like to ` put the blame on innocent people ; you 've just pulled that out of your arse . 
  have to face facts . 
  one effect of being in the fortunate position of having your native language the * de facto lingua franca * - ho ho - is that the many others around the world who speak it get to change it and redefine it . 
  i liked your song, 
  i quite liked france 's song . 
  is there something wrong with me ? 
  sorry , should have said , federation , not integration . 
  that article simply has nothing to say about us views on political integration , let alone forming a federal government . 
  but we simply do n't need to . 
  when i was over in germany a few months ago i was talking to my german colleagues about their astonishingly good english . 
  they pointed out that they 're forever downloading british and american tv and film and browsing the largely english - language web . 
  the position is n't reciprocally balanced for us : the web is not largely in german and from what i 've heard about german tv it 's hardly worth watching : and now herzog 's making all his films in english there 's hardly a necessity , is there  ? 
  so , yes , it might be great to read goethe in the original but to do that i 'd have to be a language expert , not a casual user . 
  i 'm afraid there simply is n't the incentive or support for native english speakers trying to learn another european language that there is for everyone else trying to learn english . 
  any list that does n't mention rome can be ignored . 
  science , eh ? 
  ca n't beat it . 
  ` verbal assault rules ' ? 
  what rubbish . 
  what are we saying here : that greeks are too inclined to vote fascist if they see a clear demonstration by a politician that he 's a fascist ? 
  of * course not * . 
  let him carry on , let him yell these things as much as he wants . 
  it can only alienate more people against him . 
   * the us is generally confused as to why europe does n't just form a federal government . 
  * what evidence do you have for this claim ? 
   * slowed down the european process * the problem here is that you think there is a predefined process and anyone not buying in completely and without pause is seen as slowing it down . 
  news for you : there * is no ineluctable process * ** other ** than the one agreed upon by the member states . 
  * agreed * upon . 
   * the us against the eu in a few cases ( iraq war for instance for the last outrageous one ) . 
  * the uk supported the us . 
  what body of the eu propounded an alternative ` eu ' view ? 
  with what authority ? 
  also , in what way was it ` outrageous ' ? 
   * british meddling in eu affairs * did n't know it was france 's to meddle with . 
   * brits have against the french , not the opposite * the french are just jealous of us . 
  of course it can . 
  who claimed otherwise ? 
   * well i do n't really give a crap what hodge said * my mistake ... i assumed you would care , given that this thread is about what she said . 
  or perhaps you '' re just stupid ...  * do n't even know who she/he/it is . 
  * yup , that 'd be it . 
   * it 's not actually an ethics issue * no : but hodge claimed it was . 
   * by reneging on their responsibilities to society * eh ? 
  what ` responsibilities to society ' do you imagine a search enginge company has ... and when did it acquire them ? 
   * business should never be trusted to self-regulate * i 'm not aware of any country or legal jurisdiction where businesses ` self-regulate ' . 
  you 've brought this up for what reason ? 
  oh , nothing , just the suggestion in your quote that there was no violence seems at odds with the police being ` forced ' . 
  no , really : let 's leave aside ` calculating ' . 
  i 'm sure that 's what accountants are supposed to do . 
  anyone in business really . 
  what 's unethical about google ? 
   * the harassed and ill-prepared handful of officers were forced to push him back into the canon 's gait * from the same article . 
  in what way ? 
  the ` committee ' did n't . 
  they were ill-chosen words by one committee member . 
  or : low wage costs impel movement of low-skilled jobs from other parts of sweden to malmo . 
  see ? 
  anyone can tell a just-so story . 
  but why would you * expect * your tale to be the true one ? 
  why would you expect unemployment to increase ? 
   * i do n't expect it to happen , even if they do eventually get around to having a vote on it . 
  * i agree . 
  these people are n't stupid . 
  it 's all about posturing for the ukip vote and for speeded up resolution of several outstanding issues at the european level . 
  thing is , they do need to convince other canny politicians so they really do have to take it to the wire . 
  there 's always a chance of something going wrong . 
   * disillusion * dissolution . 
  but you may have a point . 
   * crusade * cruise . 
  but you are spanish , * reconquista * and all that ... , 
   * t least the people cared about eachother * they certainly looked out for each other . 
  by 1995 , 174,000 stasi informants had been identified , 2.5 % of east germany 's population between the ages of 18 and 60 . 
  so caring . 
  ` europe ' day ? 
  well ... the stereotype for me in the uk is just blond - and even of red . 
  no , and the question was n't about that very light blond ... but it does n't seem particularly easy to get the figures ... you find yourself on yahoo answers or stormfront , neither of which are particularly satisfactory places to hang around , 
  that 's not ` views on multiculturalism ' . 
  that 's just racism . 
  it does n't help to conflate racism with a disapproval of multiculturalism . 
  well ... no , not always . 
  yes . 
  welsh is n't politically independent enough or sensible enough or big enough to go it alone . 
  christ , those are some awful photos . 
  why were you wondering who ? 
  why does that matter ? 
  why do you want a definition ? 
  why is * that * important ? 
  you asked ` who defines what is backwards ' . 
  it 's a dishonest question because of course you 'd have no hesitation in labeling something ` backwards ' , if only privately for fear of being thought racist , without demanding from yourself a definition . 
  triumphantly asking for a definition is beside the point . 
  you will laugh at a joke without asking for a definition of a joke . 
  you 'll be scared ( or perhaps amused ) by a horror film without asking for a definition of horror . 
  you 'll be excited by pornography without asking for a definition of pornography . 
  why do you think a definition here is so important ? 
  we have rules of thumb . 
  they 'll do .
