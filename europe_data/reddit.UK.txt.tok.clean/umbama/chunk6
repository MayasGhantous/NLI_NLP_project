  do you * disagree * with any of those ? 
  but omg !, 
  you have no * definition * . 
  how can that possibly be ? 
  as i said . 
  disingenuous and unreasonable . 
  no because - if you recall - you 're the one who waltzed around the thread declaring everyone 's responses were incomprehensible because the subject was framed as a hypothetical . 
  it 's the most disingenuous , most stupid and most self-defeating response i think i 've ever seen on red dit . 
   * we 're talking about a hypothetical future , not the current eu . 
  note the subjunctive mood in the op . 
  * parroting the same line ? 
  we are * considering * the current eu when contemplating the future ; for the * current * eu is the best guide and model we have when thinking about the future . 
  so : we are completely reasonable and justified in considering the present . 
  how does one ever make a reasonable guess at the future * other than by considering the present * . 
  but of course you know this . 
  i 've already pointed out to you [ ** your footling , sophomoric stupidity ** ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1dm1lj/would_you_be_for_a_more_multiethnic_or/c9rxgoy ) . 
   * i merely expressed my incredulity at its being asked * no , you 're just avoiding a perfectly clear question because you 'd prefer it was n't asked and you 'd prefer people did n't answer . 
  you 're scared . 
  no , you really do n't understand do you . 
  my point was that this is not hypothetical for the british at the moment * however the question is framed * . 
  if i stamped on your foot repeatedly while asking , ` would you welcome my stamping on your foot ' , your asserting my question was hypothetical would be preposterous and irrelevant . 
  incidentally , i do n't know what you think you mean by saying the question is a ` hypothetical ' one . 
  the uk * is * experiencing exactly this . 
  it is n't at all ` hypothetical ' . 
  you really are a bit dim . 
   * in practice . 
  the question is a hypothetical one . 
  * that 's right . 
  in practice , that 's what would be the case . 
   * asking whether one would be for or against a specific consequence of immigration would not be the same as asking whether one would be for or against immigration in general . 
  * except there would be no reason to express a preference and no reason to ask the question if you were not in fact considering the consequences . 
  i do n't know if you think you 're being terribly right-on but you 're not . 
  you 're just being terribly stupid . 
  of course it is n't an ` entirely ' different topic . 
  a * more * multiethnic or multiracial society in the uk would come about through further immigration . 
  from other countries . 
  other countries that have different cultures . 
  understand now , dimbo ? 
  you actually asked an unreasonable , disingenuous question . 
  and you know it . 
  who defines a joke ? 
  and yet i can still laugh . 
  well , because other ethnicities in larger numbers wo n't just bring their skin and their selves ; they 'll bring their traditional cultures . 
  as the * imposition * of host-nation monoculturism seems to be a no-no and even an expression of * preference * for the host culture seems to be frowned upon it means being obliged to support a multiculturalism that involves cultural mores and practices you might find troublesome ; and that supporting multiculturalism necessarily waters down the coherence of the sense of nationhood . 
  now all these things may not matter to you . 
  some of these things may in fact be welcome . 
  but to express a feigned lack of comprehension is disingenuous , i think . 
   * do you actually think that different ideological camps only concentrated on one type of economic growth or the other * i see you have n't bothered to read the krugman paper i linked to . 
   * what has that got to do with anything today , almost 30 years after the end of the cold war * we were talking about the history of growth and the supposed necessity of increaed resource consumption . 
  you 're not doing to well understanding this are you ? 
  you 're a bit ... * special * . 
  looked up the meaning of ` totalitarian ' did you ? 
  tell me ... did you * ever * think i was interested in a ` constructive conversation ' with you ? 
  if nothing else convinces you of your stupidity , that should . 
   * i give a counterexample that it 's not just the markets that can grow at a breakneck pace . 
  * i do n't think you understand what you think you 're talking about . 
  you claimed that resource consumption was necessary for economic growth . 
  that 's a fallacy . 
  it is n't . 
  and i pointed out that in the soviet union , which you lauded , their growth had been achieved * only * by consuming additional resources . 
   * you have to put everyone that criticizes your darlings in the totalitarian box ? 
  * are you suggesting that the soviet union * was n't * totalitarian ? 
  do you even know what that word means ? 
  perhaps you do n't . 
   * the ussr did make significant strides forward , going from a late feudal society to space flight in half a century . 
  * the increase in gdp made by the soviet union was made almost entirely , perhaps completely , through increased resource consumption ( see [ ** paul krugman here ** ] ( http://media.ft.com/cms/b8268ffe-7572-11db-aea1-0000779e2340.pdf ) ) . 
  this is the sort of growth you appear to be castigating when you claim it of the west . 
  i ca n't be certain , then , why you welcome it when it 's the experience of communist totalitarianism . 
  on the other hand the increase in gdp in the west over the same period can be significantly attributed to improvement in total factor productivity . 
  this is the sort of growth you would appear to welcome - except of course when it 's the west doing it . 
  when you 're so partisan as to be so obviously and foolishly contradictory do n't you think you ought to pause and examine your prejudices ? 
  i have n't said correlation should be ignored . 
  i have n't said it does n't matter . 
  no wonder you have a hard time with other facts if this is how you go about things . 
   * unquestionable benefits * see , you 've introduced the ` unquestionable ' here . 
  of course the benefits are questionable. , it 's just that longevity , low infant mortality , that sort of thing , i prefer to miserable poverty and high death rates . 
  look , if it was simply a question of burning fuel * in itself * then we would n't , over the 20th c , have seen virtually all growth in the soviet union coming from increased resource consumption while the west 's growth was significantly attributable to improvements if total factor productivity . 
  but do n't bother dealing with facts , figures and history , eh ? 
   * put a graph of fossil fuel use next to those , and you 'll see the correlation * put a graph of increase in height . 
  you 'll see a correlation . 
   * how you can characterize the 19th century , a time of grabbing control of colonies and critical resources , as free market and international trade is bizarre . 
  * not to recognise that the 19th c saw a decline in mercantilism and an opening up of markets is laughable . 
  we 're not talking an absolute here , we 're talking a process . 
  do n't be so childish . 
   * i just want as few as possible people to know about what i define as privacy * yes but :  * ` when i use a word , ' humpty dumpty said , in rather a scornful tone , ` it means just what i choose it to mean * you simply ca n't reasonably redefine ` private ' as ` that which happens in public ' . 
   * if they put import duties on us we 'd put them on them * no , no point doing that , we can have their stuff cheaply and they 'll have to have our stuff artificially expensive ,, 
   * our pretty decent privacy laws * take a look at the map and recent headlines again your laws seem pretty aberrant to me . 
  now it could be that you folk have got it right and everyone else is wrong . 
  could be . 
  on the other hand , it might be worthwhile thinking about it . 
   * some people actually do n't seem to care aout privacy * i do n't think that 's right , do you ? 
  people care about privacy but they understand that when they 're in public they 're not - you know - in private . 
  whatever it is you 're talking about it is n't * privacy * - but that 's just semantics on my part . 
   * do n't seem to care that everything they type in the awesomebar wander to google , that they 're tracked on their android/iphones or whatever . 
  * well i find i get a useful service by doing so ... what 's the downside you 're actually worried about ?
