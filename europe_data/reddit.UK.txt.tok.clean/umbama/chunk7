  yes , ok , but we 're not discussing the * law * here to begin with are we . 
  we 're trying to understand what reasonable concerns , if any , underpin your concerns and then support the existing law ; or whether we could reasonably change that law . 
  i think we could . 
  what doe the questions mean ? 
   * attending demonstrations * have i ever ? 
  yes . 
  do i habitually ? 
  historically have attended more than other people ... maybe when i was younger . 
  can see myself going on one in the near future ? 
  do n't think so . 
  do i support the right ? 
  yes . 
  so how do i answer ` yes ' or ` no ' to ` attending demonstrations ' ? 
  it 's * irony * . 
  the british are supposed to do irony rather well . 
   * i highly disagree with the argument you listed further down * that was n't me - but as it happens it 's simply a description of a legal fact in the uk . 
   * i think it 's not completely okay to be photographed in public just because you 're in public * i do n't * really * understand your concerns . 
  but look , you must accept that we have to balance * your * concern here against the enormous public benefit . 
  and we 're talking about something that * you are doing in public already * . 
   * i think it 's not completely okay to be photographed in public just because you 're in public * it simply is in the uk . 
  do n't know what the law is in germany but nobody 's ever bothered me when i 've taking photos when i 've been over there . 
   * uk is high maintenance * in what way ? 
   * does n't want to pay full rent and only chooses the bills she ( yes , you 're the girl in this relationship ) likes * we 're a net contributor . 
  what else would you like us to pay you for ? 
  so : which ` vast parts of the population ' have not benefited , over what period of time ? 
  surely your ` intl. 
  trade professor ' would be fascinated by your answer . 
    straw man . 
  nobody 's tried to . 
   * you did . 
  `` when we trade internationally we all get wealthier . 
  '' * now you 're just lying . 
  i said that when we trade internationally we all get wealthier . 
  that is by and large true . 
  i did * not * say there were no attendant problems . 
  i did * not * try to * ` sell it as a totally non-problematic development ' * . 
  you are lying . 
  i presume you 're lying because your initial claim is so obviously false you look a little silly . 
  but being silly * and * being a liar is n't an obvious improvement on just being silly . 
   * vast parts of the population are not benefiting from the bigger pie * here 's the [ ** world average gdp per capita rise ** ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/world_gdp_per_capita_1500_to_2000,_log_scale.png/350px-world_gdp_per_capita_1500_to_2000,_log_scale.png ) since 1500 . 
  [ ** here 's the us rise ** ] ( http://visualeconsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/realgdppercapita.png ) since 1871 . 
  now with such an enormous and impressive increase it would be dumbfounding if ` vast parts of the population ' had nevertheless not benefited . 
  so someone unaware of any facts but your silly claim and those two graphs would by now be feeling extremely suspicious . 
  so which ' * vast parts or the population * ' have not benefited , over what period of time ? 
   * in the developed world , loosers are , for example , low-skilled workers with declining wages for quite a few decades now * and all those postillions and gas-lamp lighters , and blacksmiths , and steam-engine shovellers . 
   * gains from globalizations are not distributed equally , even more : most of the gains go to the top 1 % * oh this is just footling nonsense . 
  how we redistribute wealth within a state is a political issue ; and besides , what 's your alternative ? 
   * not mean we can sell trade globalization as a totally non-problematic development . 
  * straw man . 
  nobody 's tried to . 
   * revulsion is what i feel when i think about my country * really ? 
  why ? 
  http://thefilter.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/poverty.jpg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_divergence http://visualeconsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/realgdppercapita.png https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/world_gdp_per_capita_1500_to_2000,_log_scale.png/350px-world_gdp_per_capita_1500_to_2000,_log_scale.png look what happened when technology , international trade and free ( ish ) markets kicked in . 
  come back to me when you 'd like to consider facts rather than your childish prejudices . 
   * the only solution really is protectionism . 
  * you do n't understand economics . 
  a shame for someone from the same country as the great [ ** fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric bastiat ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fr%c3%a9d%c3%a9ric_bastiat ) . 
  why not try [ ** his very funny essay on protectionism ** ] ( http://www.infotextmanuscripts.org/other_candlemakers.html ), 
  chinese sweatshop workers choose the sweatshops because they 're more attractive than the alternatives . 
  and as a result of them chinese workers are getting wealthier . 
  http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/alex-massie/2013/04/in-praise-of-sweatshops/ when we trade internationally we all get wealthier . 
  ooohhhh ... * corporations *, 
  ` revolting ; ? 
  you might think a constitutional monarchy an anachronism although that 's perhaps not paying enough regard to or giving sufficient thanks for the fact you live in a country where institutions can be slowly adapted to contemporary democracy rather than one where we just have a bloody revolution . 
  but ` revolting ' seems a bit of an odd reaction . 
  oooohhhh ... the mockery by millions of people i will never know or meet ... mockery of my haircut , my choice in footwear ... oooooohhhhhhhh !!!, 
  people ... in the street ... ? 
  concerned about their faces being visible ... ? 
   * so germans are n't really `` backwards '' because they do n't `` support '' google streetview * no , really , they are . 
   * because germans care about privacy * yeah , privacy . 
  my house 's privacy has been terribly compromised now it 's on street view . 
  it 's very upset . 
  * what are you talking about ? 
  more than that - their car , loaded with weapons , was stopped * because it was n't insured * . 
  it 's pure * three lions * . 
  well the final solution had n't been arrived at ; but there was no doubt about the nazis and their aims . 
  i think i was n't clear in what i was trying to say . 
  cheers . 
  but neither do i. . . i 'm not clear what analogy you 're drawing . 
  ah yes that free money ... 
  ` with the support of the european commission . ', 
  why ? 
  i think you need to go an lie down . 
   * so yeah the british were much worse than the germans * really , they were n't . 
  and you know nothing about history and you have no moral sense at all . 
  still . 
  i can always ignore you . 
   * america did n't jump into the war until it was attacked * i agree . 
  there was an isolationist , even pro-german strand in us politics ( see joe kennedy , for example ) that made it impossible for fdr to get into the war beforehand . 
  that fact does n't make the us tardiness * correct * it simply illustrates that fdr knew what the correct thing to do was . 
  so what lesson should we draw from that re . 
  ireland , do you suppose ? 
   * ireland was n't the only european country to declare neutrality in the war * it 's the only one you 're defending at the moment . 
   * were their positions immoral too * i 'd need some time to consider each of their actual positions but my immediate , unconsidered default answer would be : * yes . 
  * i might be swayed if it could plausibly be argued that the civilian population would have suffered needlessly and fruitlessly ; and even then i 'm not sure . 
  right . 
  the british were just as bad as the nazis . 
  right . 
   * of course the choice is simple in hindsight * again , ** no ** . 
  none of the allies had hindsight .
