   * what the hell difference would it have made had we joined ? 
  * my argument is about the immorality of the irish position , not the execution of the war . 
  when , for the purposes of argument , you find yourself representing the allied battle against genocidal totalitarian fascism as ' * doing britain 's * ' bidding you really ought to stop and consider how your thoughts have led you to such a preposterous position . 
   * `` these bombings are just thatcher 's chickens coming home to roost * thatcher 's chickens ? 
  see , this is the sort of ignorance of history that i find infuriating . 
  you - or the bostonians you 're channeling here , rather - have no obligation to understand british and irish history ... * unless you decide you pronounce upon the subject and get involved . 
  * airey neave , for instance , was assassinated by the inla before thatcher was prime minister . 
  this was n't thatcher 's doing , even in the warped world where a terrorist bomb is the fault of the victim . 
   * many rural pakistanis and afghanis were sympathetic to the motives of osama bin laden on 9/11 . 
  do you sit back with the same sense of `` maybe now they 'll reflect on their support of extremist causes ! '', 
  when a us drone blows up a primary school ? 
  * i think you 're slightly misunderstanding me . 
  i do n't revel in the fact of the bomb in boston . 
  as far as i 'm concerned it was a detestable atrocity , as was 9/11 , 7/7 , madrid , bali , the assassinations of airey neave , ian gow , lord mountbatten , ross mcwhirter , the hyde park bomb , the birmingham pub bombings , the guildford pub bombing , the manchester bomb , the omagh bombing , the brighton bombing and many , many , many more . 
  i 'm consistent in my loathing of these terrorist outrages . 
  but i * do * find the response of * some * bostonians hypocritical . 
  a non-trivial number of bostonians have supported terrorist bombings in my country during my lifetime . 
   * hy should ireland have gone to war with germany ? 
  * because germany under hitler was an aggressive , genocidal , totalitarian dictatorship that was killing people by the tens of thousands . 
  oh , i know . 
  let * other * people sort it out for you . 
   * staying neutral during the war was one of eamon develera 's greatest achievements . 
  * allowing others to give their lives in the battle against totalitarian , genocidal fascism while staying out of it was a great achievement ? 
   * you forget quite a major thing . 
  no one knew the nazi 's were committing mass genocide until the war turned in the allies favour * everybody knew * most * of the facts of nazism , if not the final solution . 
  what do you think mein kampf , the nuremberg laws and the fleeing of jews from germany was all about ? 
   * also eamon sent his condolences to both germany and america after their leaders died * er ... official neutrality did n't oblige you to express condolences on the death of hitler . 
   * also would you like to know who invented concentration camps ? 
  why the british did * simply a logical fallacy . 
  the fact of the concentration camps in the boer war does n't absolve ireland from its appalling moral failure in wwii . 
   * how about when the british killed the native americans to take their land from them * absolutely irrelevant . 
   * so why do n't you get the irish point of view * because it was disgraceful . 
  his comments on your neutrality were infinitely preferable to your neutrally . 
  and the condolences you expressed on hitler 's death . 
  and there 'd be no conductor , the players would be playing in different keys and tempi , they 'd have lied about their musical competence in order to get the gig , all their instruments would be on loan and they 'd be using the occasion to pickpocket each other . 
  nope , it 's just unhelpful . 
  you know you 're committing a strict logical fallacy there do n't you ? 
   * if you are going to condemn germany for aggressive , unprovoked invasions , you should condemn the allies as well . 
  * which part of the fact that hitler started the sequence of aggressive invasions , and that the allies fought only as a last resort to * prevent * him , did you miss ? 
  or leave out of your calculation when deciding each side had to be condemned in the same way for what you oddly assert is the same thing ? 
  let me make this simple for you . 
  if you , unprovoked and yelling foul insults , hit me in the face and i hit you back are you * really * claiming we 're morally indistinguishable ? 
   * but if we 're discounting the holocaust , then exactly what moral impetus did ireland have for joining the war ? 
  * you 're suggesting that without the fact of the final solution there was no moral purpose to stopping hitler ? 
  you 've just made my point for me . 
  thank you . 
  although you 're probably too dim to notice ... 
   * we 're arguing about the morality of ireland not intervening to end the holocaust * no , we were arguing about ireland 's neutrality . 
  i 've already pointed out that at the beginning of the war the final solution was n't yet policy . 
  so you 're wrong again . 
   * also , i was n't talking specifically about contemporary atrocities , you mentioned syria , not me . 
  * you did mention contemporary atrocities . 
   * the long list of genocides that were n't * ** or are n't ** * being stopped by nato/the allies * so you 're wrong again . 
   * you take my words out of context * nope , you 're doing that whenever i point out you 're dissembling , lying or just simply dim . 
   * you look at something like the holocaust and say ` never again ' . 
  not ` never again against the jews ' , * eh , had to get a little gratuitous dig in there did n't you . 
  as nobody has suggested that the only group worth caring about is the jews ; but as you brought that into it as if someone had ; then i think we both know where you 're coming from , do n't we , sonny ? 
   * actually i stated that the only thing that distinguished britain from nazi germany ... * nope . 
  you said :  * i ca n't imagine there are many irishmen who lived at the time who looked at britain fighting germany and saw any difference between them . 
  * here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1d5eah/sir_winston_churchill_to_feature_on_new_5_note/c9npris  * if that 's the only other ` genocide ' you are aware of * the point remains , regardless of your silly attempts at insults . 
  your claim appears to be that the west 's unwillingness or inability to intervene in contemporary genocides demonstrates that the genocidal nature of nazism could n't have played any part in the our motivation to got to war with and to defeat germany . 
  that makes your really rather dim . 
   * if you do some reading on imperlalism , colonialism , apartheid and segregation * if you stop trying to dishonestly attach yourself to any passing cause or minority group for a second and accept that ireland 's role in wwii was thoroughly disreputable you would n't have to tell barefaced lies about mr devalera 's * purely personal * expression of condolences . 
   * you resort to racist views * no * you * do . 
  i 'm not the one who asserted the irish could n't tell the difference between the british and nazi germany . 
  i was repeating your own stated view back to you sardonically . 
   * the long list of genocides that were n't or are n't being stopped by nato/the allies * what * are * you talking about ? 
  are you really trying to preposterously claim that the contemporary difficulty of taking action in syria proves that the genocidal nature of totalitarian fascism could n't have been a motivation for the british in wwii ? 
  bit of a stretch even for your tenuous grasp on reality . 
   * without it , it 's just another example of apartheid/segregation/imperialism , * no it is n't . 
  and ` imperialism ' is a significantly different beast to apartheid . 
  your rolling them together * again * demonstrates your complete failure to understand the moral bankruptcy of ireland . 
   * eamon devalera 's personal views . 
  * * ireland * expressed its condolences . 
  it 's absurd to pretend the the taoiseach ** and ** the president ** both ** conveying condolences to germany via the german embassy were somehow acting * in a private capacity * . 
  your unbelievable contortions to avoid the truth really carries on that disgraceful episode . 
  * what * ? 
   * captain hindsight * you did n't need hindsight . 
  none of the allies needed hindsight . 
   * he allies did not fight ww2 to end the holocaust or for the freedom of small nations , they fought it for their own interests * and this is simply incorrect . 
  there was n't a single motive and motives were mixed . 
  self-interest played a part . 
  but claiming that a principled desire to stop genocidal fascism was n't a main motivation is just ahistorical , self-serving nonsense . 
   * seeing ww2 as nazi germany with their jewish concentration camps vs america with their japanese concentration camps , russia with their gulags , and the british who invented concentration camps and personally terrorised ireland for centuries was a valid assessment . 
  * no it was n't . 
  germany 's treatment of the jews was well-understood even if the final solution had n't yet been arrived at . 
  claiming that the good folk of ireland * and their leaders * knew enough about the conditions in german concentration camps , but not death camps , to assess them as being on a par with the boer war camps is , again , ahistorical self-serving nonsense . 
   * you 'll know it was also evil . 
  * so sending condolences about hitler 's death is excused ? 
   * i ca n't imagine there are many irishmen who lived at the time who looked at britain fighting germany and saw any difference between them * if that 's true then that says a lot about irish stupidity or willful blindness . 
  but we 're not really debating your paucity of imagination here are we . 
   * we had bigger things to consider * bigger than the genocidal fascism sweeping across all of europe . 
  really now ? 
  and what was that ? 
  the 1939 * rose of tralee * competition ? 
  simply not comparable . 
  napoleon was no hitler and it was n't a question of a democracy fighting against genocidal fascism . 
  if you have to try to draw such implausible analogies you might stop to wonder how you 've come to that point . 
   * moral or otherwise , to fight britain 's enemies ? 
  * if you typify nazi germany merely as * britain 's enemies * then you may have an argument , although still not one i 'd accept .
