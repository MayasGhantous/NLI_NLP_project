  the problem is that they tend to kill themselves in a bloody big explosion . 
  nearly every citizen in all of europe did . 
  so because cameron wanted to mess around in the me , we should all pay for it ? 
  and does n't have a bloody big tunnel leading to it . 
  his name is crusty wankstain . 
  he 's definitely being sarcastic . 
  ~ ~ we 're getting downvoted . 
  some people really dislike good ol' boris ! ~ ~ yay we love boris again !, 
  i 'd be so happy if boris was pm . 
  our foreign relations would go to shit but it 'd be hilarious while doing so . 
  osborne is much better than he used to be though . 
  he 's practically [ james bond !,

  yeah because hypocrisy instantly invalidates every issue in the world . 
  plus it 's not like i personally gave the money to the banks is it ... 
  \\  implying greece is n't already corrupt . 
  it 's called a joke . 
  the tears on / r/unitedkingdom when osborne is pm will be glorious . 
  it 's like a pilgrimage to mecca but for neckbeards rather than muslims . 
  they would block it for regular people but give permission wherever it is necessary . 
  what happened with github ? 
  if it was banned in russia that 'd be massive for developers . 
  bloody hell that 's a lot . 
  not an actual metric but for example how many fuel trucks that is . 
  how much is that for those of us who have no idea what 120pj looks like ? 
  boris in * any * position would be perfect . 
  i 'm probably being dumb but what is the eu supposed to do about the us ? 
  thanks . 
  missed that . 
  anyone can edit a wikipedia page , plus it does n't mention anything about them using teenage boys . 
   iran which used teenage boys holding the quran and no gun straight into battle to clear minefields do you have a source for that ? 
  uk and france combined have a more powerful army than russia . 
  they were . 
  the fascists at cadbury 's decided to stop making them though . 
  `` in the game of blobs , you win or you die . '', 
  - / r/eu4 france, 
  that 's why we need other leaders to get on board and help reform it . 
  the majority of the public only care about immigration . 
  they probably are n't even aware of all the fantastic eu policies such as the ones regarding labour . 
  i felt a bit of sick rise up just then . 
  edit : i 'm getting downvoted over greggs ... damn you guys take that place seriously . 
  [ 100 % real ... ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2014/10/28/1414514643907/c923d015-2946-4fe4-bd3d-2dcd73c846a0-bestsizeavailable.jpeg ), 
  coffee is nothing compared to our glorious tea . 
  i will drown you in tea mother fucker !, 
   you 're just tea americans . 
  \\* flips desk \\*, 
  horrifying . 
  1 is by definition not a prime number though . 
  how is 1 ` technically ' a prime ? 
  its only divisor is itself . 
  default subs are different depending on your country ? 
  never knew that . 
  when i went to blue lagoon i was horrified by the changing rooms more than anything else . 
  a chubby french man said `` pardon '' and sort of waddled past me with it all bangin ' around . 
  he does n't want to ban encryption . 
  he never said anything of that sort , people just interpreted him as saying that . 
  he still is a cunt though . 
  when all the racist elderly who do n't work bugger off then the majority of the people will be for the eu i think . 
  if you consider that europe used to be basically non-stop conflict until very recently , you can see why someone who was raised in the 50 's or whenever to be quite anti-europe . 
  ( and therefore anti-eu ) they also do n't work so do n't benefit from all the wonderful eu labour policies . 
  only a single isp , talk-talk , has the filter enabled for over 10 % of users . 
  the rest are all sub-10 % . 
  virgin has the lowest percentage enabled at 4 % of all customers . 
  you need to bear in the mind that us brits will complain about basically anything under the sun . 
  ( or not under the sun when it 's bloody raining ) cameron is a bit of a cunt though ... 
  them being revenge killings does n't justify it . 
  if anything it makes it far worse . 
  that 's still tens of billions per country . 
  as a brit , your trains are brilliant . 
  i 'm in lower sixth ( uk ) and today i had to give a presentation to the upper school on the eu . 
  what does the writing say ? 
  if you fish more there 's gon na be less fish ... 
  it 's annoying that it won that when it is n't historically accurate . 
  i guess that explains why it 's fucking bizarre then . 
  being british i just could n't really help myself . 
  we 're talking about developed nations here . 
  what ... ? 
  how is that relevant to earthquakes in europe ? 
  because eagles are cool as fuck ? 
  what you 're taught depends on what exam board you 're doing and what case studies your teacher chooses to use . 
  i 'd say that being forced to whip my nob out ( assuming i 'm understanding what you 're saying correctly ) is * a bit * more intrusive than going to the dentist . 
  leaving or staying ? 
  no it does n't . 
  britain is * specifically * england , wales and scotland . 
  hence `` the british isles '' . 
  the uk is all that plus northern ireland . 
  i said that slavery is already taught as a thing that happened . 
  look for an argument elsewhere as i have the same viewpoint as you . 
  i never said a single thing about that . 
  i 'm not some ` pc-at-all-costs ' moron ... 
  it 's taught in context of the british empire as part of history . 
  modern slavery is usually covered in philosophy and ethics . 
  edit : down voted for stating facts about our education system ? 
  slavery , etc. 
  is already taught as something that was pretty shitty . 
   porpoises [ they look so happy !, 
  ] ( http://idontseatheporpoiseinthis.weebly.com/uploads/2/6/0/1/26012442/136029_orig.jpg ), 
  it 's like mid south i think . 
  it 's against the geneva conventions , but some insurgents in syria would n't exactly care about that . 
  maybe i just have bad memory but was n't there a lot of evidence to suggest that was a false flag operation ?
