  i ca n't go into that much detail right now but i 'll try and summarise as best i can . 
  this is off the top of my head so do n't take it as gospel . 
  the main parties are [ labour ] ( http://www.labour.org.uk ) , [ conservatives ] ( https://www.conservatives.com ) ( current government , also called tories ) and the [ liberal democrats ] ( http://www.libdems.org.uk/ ) ( who i 'm a member of ) . 
  ** key manifesto points - labour : ** * scrap student tuition fees . 
  currently # 9k/year , with 6 % interest . 
  you graduate with around # 35k debt for tution fees alone . 
  * nationalise the water utility companies . 
  * re-nationalise railways . 
  * hire 10,000 new police officers . 
  ( there is now around 40,000 less police offices than when tories came into power 7 years ago ) * raise income tax on higher earners . 
  * invest more into public services . 
  when the election was called , labour were 25 points down in the polls . 
  now they are equal with the tory party due to the tory 's horrendous campaign . 
  their leader , corbyn , has extremely biased media coverage against him as well yet he seems to have pulled through . 
  ** key manifesto points - conservative : ** * scrapping triple lock pensions . 
  * cut net migration to below 100,000 . 
  * increase the higher tax rate bracket from # 45k to # 50k . 
  * cut corporation tax to 17 % . 
  although i 'm biased , the tory manifesto is undoubtedly the worse of the lot . 
  it is completely uncosted . 
  ( unlike the others ) their leader/current pm theresa may has refused to have even a single debate , which is absolutely appalling . 
  they are also trying to clamp down on internet regulation , and banning end-to-end encryption . 
  personally , i think they have extremely dangerous ideals and that they should n't be allowed near government . 
  ** key manifesto points - lib dems : ** * commit to the eu single market . 
  the uk financial services industry is very reliant upon this . 
  manufacturing reliant upon ` jit ' methods will likely collapse without access as well . 
  * 1 pence income tax raise to fund nhs and social care . 
  * decriminalise and end imprisonment for possession of illegal drugs * for personal use * . 
  * 200 % council tax on second homes . 
  most luxury apartments in cities are bought by foreign investors who never live there , driving up prices for locals . 
  * # 7bn investment into education . 
  it 's a large generalisation , but the lib dems are the sort of party that the stereotypical redditor would conform to . 
  liberal ( in the true meaning of the word ) and very socially liberal with centrist economics . 
   corbyn has little backbone where 've you gotten this from ? 
  i 'm not voting labour tomorrow but i think he 's has the strongest backbone of the lot . 
  so you live in a small town and you feel the need to be surrounded by assault rifles ? 
  must be a pretty horrendous place without those guns . 
  i do n't know where you live ( gon na guess the us ) but i can guarantee that the armed officers in london responded faster than they would have in your home town . 
  those are for specialised armed police though , not regular ones . 
  ah yes i 'm sure a 9mm pistol could stop a 4 tonne van ... 
  the attackers were all shot within 8 minutes by armed police anyway . 
  no one in the uk wants guns , only foreign retards who do n't understand the country . 
  police do n't want guns . 
  batons are actually incredibly powerful when used correctly . 
  you can break someone 's arm in a single hit with one and they have a lot more reach than a knife . 
  eu is the largest trading bloc in the world , even it alone could cause a lot of harm to the us . 
  i think maybe china could maybe hop on board ( but they 're so heavily export based that it 'd be questionable ) if they saw it as being beneficial to them . 
  if that became a serious issue then the eu would slap an export tax on us goods . 
  plus , us producers already meet the requirements so i doubt they 'd immediately dump pro-environment production for what could be a short term blip . 
  why do n't you vote labour then ? 
  if you 're in a safe seat then it 'll locally have the same effect as spoiling your ballot but indicate to the tories that you 're unhappy with them in the overall voting figures . 
  right wing memes are jacob rees-mogg . 
  the odd thing is that he 's completely and utterly insane he just has a posh voice . 
  * ford europe . 
  it 's very , very different from ford in the us . 
  cameron was alright . 
  not good but acceptable , especially for a conservative . 
  and 100 % american . 
  i 'm pretty sure it was the fault of engineers at the contractor used to produce the piece of equipment . 
  nasa used metric at the time afaik . 
  what 's your opinion on people in work who are unable to pay for food , rent , utilities then ? 
  yeah it 's bizarre . 
  if i could actively chose to make myself more wealthy over the course of a few years i would easily . 
  apparently for some people that 's a hard decision to make . 
   my god , i know you did n't mean it that way , but it totally sounds like `` we are so much more different than other countries '' , which is incredibly arrogant . 
  how on earth did you infer that from / u/die _ blauen_dragoner 's comment ? 
  he 's very obviously saying that british people are european too . 
  lower income earners becoming wealthier makes everyone rich . 
  shitting on the poor is disastrous in the long run . 
  all the other parties must be metaphorical shit in your eyes then . 
  he 's survived 2 plane crashes . 
  eve online employs half the country . 
  i 'd also run away from americans shooting and bombing me . 
  neither do i. . . 
  it needs to be kept in a much better state as the seat of the government than it otherwise would do though . 
  strasbourg has no history of financial services whereas frankfurt does so that 'd be rather silly . 
   because they do n't want to spend money on a new building ? 
  it costs billions to keep parliament where it is as the palace is pretty much falling apart . 
  you 're not a very proud canadian then . 
  how would it be financed ? 
  [ yep ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69r42q/on_the_road_to_the_port_of_dover/dh97bgt ), 
  that 's how nearly every country does it though . 
  unemployment is a very well defined economic term . 
  sometimes i think that it 'd be cool to be a mod but then with threads like this i think i 'd just kill myself . 
  it does n't . 
  it 's a scratch that lines up with the ladder . 
  you can see more of them on the anchor . 
  nah , it 's just really well painted . 
  eisenhower i think . 
  the prostate is great !, 
  from what i 've gathered the russians with assets in europe tend to be people who disagree rather strongly with putin . 
  macron seems to have decent policies . 
  if ` we ' is roughly a quarter of the population , then yes . 
  i believe the uk will rejoin the eu within several decades . 
  the onus to source claims is on the person making said claims . 
  from your replies it seems like you 're talking about your arse though so i 'll leave you be . 
  do explain then . 
  how is / u/pindar _ mc lying ? 
  the eu made it clear that scotland would n't automatically be a member of the eu and that there was no guarantee they 'd be able to become one within any timeline . 
  i do n't get why everyone seems to have beef with soros .
