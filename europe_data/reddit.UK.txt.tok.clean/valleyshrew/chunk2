  if spain elects a party that agrees to give catalonia a referendum then that is democratic . 
  the way they did it without co-operation of spain is undemocratic . 
  do the majority of spanish people support independence ? 
  they have just as much right to any of the land of their country as any other citizen does . 
  residency does n't mean shit , anyone can move anywhere , so it 's discriminatory to only let residents vote . 
  it 's basically gerrymandering . 
  if you want to argue catalan culture is unique from spanish culture , then surely you will have only ethnic catalans voting regardless of where they are living ? 
  but that would be close to racism so you ca n't do that either . 
  they have a right to decide their future , they do n't have a right to steal territory of a un member state without permission . 
  oh , my mistake , i 'm used to seeing it written as 0.1 % . 
  the right to self determination means they are free to create an independent country on land they are sovereign over and move there . 
  catalonia is land of the spanish government , so they can only get independence with the agreement of all of spain because spain has the right to territorial integrity . 
  they do not have the right to unilaterally annex territory of another un member state . 
  by this logic , jews living in the west bank can annex all of that land for themselves due to `` self determination '' , and in their case there is no other recognised sovereign state on the land anyway so it 's even more acceptable !, 
  in scotland 's case the entire uk population self determined a government that agreed to a referendum for the residents of scotland . 
  spain has not done that so by the right to self determination it is invalid and undemocratic . 
  so germany 's population is just under 10 million ? 
  abbas is [ an anti-semitic ] ( http://www.algemeiner.com/2015/09/18/abbas-filthy-jews-feet-not-allowed-on-temple-mount/ ) [ terrorist supporter ] ( http://unitedwithisrael.org/shocker-abbas-admits-he-supports-terrorists/ ) and [ funder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich_massacre#abu_daoud ) who is currently inciting a third intifada ( because jews want to pray at their holiest site in israel ) , while on the 9th year of his 5 year term as palestinian authority president . 
  how are left and right wing defined here ? 
  i think the conservative party in the uk is to the left of obama by most measures , and the labour party has become right wing with the election of corbyn whose best friends are russia and iran . 
  the political spectrum can not be defined on a single line , why do people love to do this so much ? 
  wanting to take steps to reduce climate change is not a left or right position . 
  being in favour of a strong military and national service is not a right or left position . 
  favouring strong regulations and high taxes is not a left or right position . 
  if a country has high economic redistribution but is a tyrannical dictatorship with little civil or political liberties , they are not left wing . 
  if a country favours highly regulated capitalism with extreme economic inequality but is a free and open democracy they are not right wing . 
  so by this logic , if you elected xa we should not be critical of it at all , right ? 
  since democracy is so sacred . 
  a good leader can take the country through a depression and a bad leader can have prosperity , it depends on many circumstances . 
  nd led at a bad time but the other greek political parties would have done a much worse job in their place . 
   like imposing a different government at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives was legitimate and morale . 
  1/4 as many people were killed per day under american occupation as under saddam . 
  the usa is not responsible for hundreds of thousands of iraqi deaths . 
  if the iraqis had accepted democracy peacefully america would have left within weeks . 
  regardless of whether you believe the invasion was justified , our intentions were good and we made great sacrifices for the iraqi people . 
  the blame for the current situation in iraq is entirely due to the iraqi people and their inability to get along . 
   in afghanistan you destroyed the opium fields without giving the people something else , if you make 1k $ per month with opium and some us asshole comes along and burns your fields ... do you think `` drugs are bad , understood '' or do you think `` fuck it , taliban it is '' ? 
  afghan gdp in 2001 was $ 115 . 
  now it is $ 664 . 
  tell me again how the usa ruined the afghani economy ? 
  the greek people somehow think that they would be ok leaving the euro , but a leader faced with the actual responsibility of doing that and completely collapsing the economy thankfully decided otherwise . 
  maybe you should realise if even tsipras did n't want to do that that maybe you 're wrong about it . 
  the referendum that the greeks gave was to renegotiate the debt and stay in the eurozone , and tsipras got the best deal he could . 
   why not just vote for someone new again ? 
  maybe because the new parties are demonstrably worse ? 
  just because things are bad does n't mean they ca n't get much worse . 
  it 's fair enough that they scout out the best place , but then they are economic migrants and we have different standards for those than asylum cases . 
  we gave iraq and afghanistan a chance to create a liberal democracy and they rejected it in favour of sectarian civil war . 
  what more could we have done ? 
   laiki enotita ( popular unity ) : brand new party created by ex-syriza mp 's and members that disagreed with the troika-turn taken by syriza.they advocate return to national currency and allying with russians and chinese.expect 3-5 % . 
   will cooperate with : propably no one leader : panagiotis lafazanis since 2015.ex-syriza mp and minister . 
  he resigned to call new elections because his party was a coalition of different ideologies and full of backstabbers who enjoy saying no to everything and ca n't be trusted with the responsibility of actually running a country . 
  now his party is more ideologically coherent and the others who left are not going to have the same amount of seats and influence in parliament as they had as a fifth column part of syriza . 
  tsipras preferred russia before he was pm , and even named his son after a guy ( che guevara ) that desired to nuke the usa and thankfully never was given control over the nukes in cuba , but being leader faces him with the reality that the eu and usa are much more practical allies .
