  you can force people to believe things . 
  how do you think protestantism took over england , you think the english people chose it ? 
  it was forced on them . 
   no , because he did his deeds in ireland . 
  how can you not follow your own logic ? 
  english gets spoken in ireland , therefore it belongs ( equally ) to the irish , even if it was born in england . 
   since he was actually english and did things in england . 
  you really sound like a racist , who gives a shit where someone was born ? 
  they had no choice in that just as they had no choice in what race they were . 
  i 'd rather have a good person from the worst country in the world than a bad person from the best country in the world . 
   fallen victim to populist and nationalist lies . 
  is it a lie that 0.09 % of the eu population has veto power ? 
  or that eu member states representing over 90 % of the eu population can support a brexit deal , but if enough low population eu member states oppose it , then it wont pass ? 
  the eu is a travesty of history and soon all big nations will want to leave it as they get a raw deal from it . 
  why should malta have the same voting power as the uk ? 
  it 's like if ron paul had the same voting power as the rest of congress put together . 
   the whole concept of eu is being greek ( in my case ) first and european second the whole concept of the eu is like the usa , but every state can have its own foreign policy , and where wyoming has the same voting power as california . 
  so if vermont wants to give us citizenship to everyone in mexico , they can do it , and then every other state has to accept all mexicans in . 
  eu was always doomed by design . 
  how is it democratic if a tiny minority of the country can steal territory that belongs to the whole country ? 
  californians are welcome to self determination on territory that they are sovereign on , they are not sovereign over california . 
  if californians have a right to secede via democracy , then every little territory of california has a right to secede from california too . 
  by your logic , if i rent a house , i 'm allowed to vote myself the owner of it . 
  these are digraphs not diphthongs . 
  but hold on , surely the european convention on human rights protects freedom of expression ? 
  let 's see what it says :  1 . 
  everyone has the right to freedom of expression . 
  this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers . 
  this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting , television or cinema enterprises . 
  the exercise of these freedoms , since it carries with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society , ** in the interests of national security ** , territorial integrity or public safety , ** for the prevention of disorder ** or crime , ** for the protection of health or morals ** , for the protection of the reputation or rights of others , for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence , or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary . 
  so if your speech can in any way be deemed immoral , it 's ok for european governments to jail you for it . 
  human rights are a joke . 
  i did n't say it was racism , i said it was close to racism . 
  and technically it is arguable that it is in fact racism because your definition is n't the only one . 
   the united nations use the definition of racial discrimination laid out in the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination , adopted in 1966 :  * any distinction , exclusion , restriction or preference based on race , color , descent , or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition , enjoyment or exercise , on an equal footing , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural or any other field of public life . 
  ( part 1 of article 1 of the u.n. international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination * by that definition , it is a discriminatory distinction based on national or ethnic origin to force people of ireland to learn irish . 
  your definition is terrible . 
  by your definition , i can support a second holocaust and i 'm not a racist if i want to kill jews because of a belief that they are racially superior to me . 
  by your definition , it 's not inherently racist to oppose inter-racial marriage . 
   the language was forged in the anglo-saxon homeland . 
  which is funnily enough , england . 
  the angles are from germany . 
  english is mainly a mixture of german , french , latin and greek . 
  it does n't belong to any one people . 
  by your logic , english is n't allowed to exist since german belongs to germans and french belongs to french etcetera . 
  languages and culture are not distinct things that belong to particular people , all humans share them . 
  should english be forced to learn old english since that 's part of their heritage too , and is the equivalent of the irish language ? 
   that 's entirely different , especially when you consider europe was pagan for thousands of years . 
  how is it different ? 
  language is part of culture , just as religion is . 
  you think ( presumably , since you 're arguing against me ) they should be obligated to learn irish because it 's their culture . 
  so is catholicism , so why should n't they be forced to believe that ? 
  i really do n't see a difference . 
  saint patrick was born in britain , does that mean the british own him and he should not be the patron saint of ireland ? 
  so you think the british should have ethnically cleansed republicans from northern ireland , since they supported terrorism and rejected british citizenship ? 
  it goes against human rights laws . 
  people can not be deported from a place they have lived all their life to a country they have never been to . 
  what 's the definition of racism ? 
  discriminating against people because of their ancestors . 
  just because irish people 's ancestors spoke a certain language does n't mean they should have to speak it also . 
  they are free to speak whatever language they want . 
   it 's protecting irish culture and heritage lmfao . 
  do you think it should be mandatory for all irish people to be catholic then , since that 's part of their heritage ? 
   and the english language does belong to the english ( i mean it was literally born in england ) the people who originated the english language have descendants all around the world . 
  not all english people stayed in england . 
  why should language be limited to a geographical location when human beings are not ? 
  and limiting it to direct descendants of those who spoke it originally is racist anyway . 
  ancient cultures are the shared product of all of humanity . 
  do you support the deportation of any jew who commits a crime to israel , even if they hate the state of israel and have never been there , since all jews are entitled to israeli citizenship ? 
  no one forced them to take those people . 
  they should n't be rewarded for it . 
  just because the language english is called english does n't mean it only belongs to the english . 
  irish have just as much right to it . 
  the fact we call it `` irish '' language does n't mean they should be obligated to learn it . 
  that 's pretty close to racism . 
  you ca n't deport people to a country they 're not from . 
  why would britain accept ireland 's terrorists ? 
  so does england . 
  still not really a country , just people using a different definition . 
  us has the highest corporate tax rate in the world , and san francisco is the most expensive city in the us . 
  if they wanted to avoid taxes they 'd relocate to ireland . 
  well it 's not a surprise since tsipras is a putin cocksucker just like trump . 
  an eu army wont happen because even malta ( 0.09 % of eu population ) can veto it . 
  ireland and sweden have historically not been part of the allied forces that made up nato , they will likely veto an eu army . 
  if they did join the eu army , they 'd end up vetoing any activity of that army so it would become totally useless . 
  an eu military fundamentally can not work because of the way the eu is set up to be extremely undemocratic and based on total consensus of all member states . 
  a military needs to have an effective leadership which can make decisions , not unanimous agreement . 
  even the most justified war in modern history , the gulf war , which liberated a un member state from an unjustified invasion , would never have happened if it required unanimous agreement in the us congress . 
  it 's an absurd handcuff to place on a military . 
  greece has to retain the capacity to fight for itself , even if a nation like sweden or ireland does n't agree with greece 's actions . 
  nato works because the countries choose to be a part of it with a common goal in mind . 
  greece is probably the odd member out being very pro-russia and anti-us but it still stays in nato for obvious reasons . 
  europe ( excluding russia ) has 1 skyscraper 300m or taller . 
  china has 60 , almost all built in the past 10 years . 
  the uae has 26 , the us 19 . 
  there are 80 more under construction around the world . 
  most are in china , 10 in india , 9 in the us , only 2 in uae , and 1 in europe ( poland ) . 
  india 's tallest building under construction is costing $ 321m . 
  it would likely cost $ 3b if built in nyc . 
  the tallest new one in london wont even make the top 200 tallest buildings in the world .
