  stuff like putting a harmless spider in a room with them . 
  you 're so adamantly against this `` suffering '' , you would rather let billions of people die ? 
  it 's really strange how often i am arguing against violence on reddit , and am heavily downvoted for opposing the vigilante violence you see on / r/justiceserved , and yet redditors will also downvote me for favouring very mild tortures that are not about a lust for revenge but about preventing further suffering . 
  redditors are ok with punching trump supporters in the face but oppose torture of islamic terrorists . 
  does n't make much sense does it ? 
  i 'm so against violence , that i think that punching someone and stone throwing should be treated as attempted murder , as they do occasionally kill people . 
  so you would give asylum to isis members ? 
  they are heavily persecuted after all . 
  it 's not race , it 's nationality/ethnicity . 
  a person raised by swedes who is genetically the same as the refugees would n't have these problems . 
  the people raised in the least liberal countries on the planet , where the majority of people support the death penalty for atheists , they do have problems . 
  by your logic saying americans are more violent than swedes is racist . 
  everyone who opposes mass immigration of the most illiberal peoples on the planet must be a trump supporter !, 
  the individuals will suffer much more due to climate change caused by overpopulation , than by losing political influence . 
  fact : sweden was anti-refugee because they were n't willing to give any visas to refugees to come to sweden safely . 
  they would accept refugees that made a dangerous journey , causing thousands to die , because this would mean a much smaller number would come and they get to still pretend they are pro-refugee . 
  so why is the swedish government so anti-refugee if they think there is no problem with refugees ? 
  the_donald is full of christian extremists who oppose islam . 
  europe is full of secular liberals who oppose islam , big difference . 
  secularists have little love for donald trump . 
   both norway and iceland consistently score better than the us in terms of press freedom . 
  i know , hence why i mentioned it !, 
  they score highly , even though they have far fewer independent media outlets , bigger monopolies , and more state controlled propaganda outlets ( i do n't actually know anything about their media , just making a reasonable guess here ) . 
  people subjectively feel that the us media is more corrupt , hateful , etc. 
  and so therefore it must be less free . 
  but the us media is very free , even if you do n't like what they are saying it does n't mean they 're not free . 
  the uk media ( since i know more about it ) is objectively much less free , much more regulated , much more government interference and so on and yet we get a better score there ? 
  there are south park episodes that ca n't air in the uk because of our harsher libel laws . 
  just a few days ago , a local election candidate in stoke was arrested for `` inciting racial hatred '' because they had criticised islam on their website . 
  that would n't happen in the us . 
  trump would be arrested here and not allowed to run . 
  the uk has objectively much less freedom of expression and of the press . 
   fox news ? 
  political ads on tv ? 
  it can still be propaganda even if the government does not own it , as long as the people who do own it have a political agenda they are willing to try to push . 
  everyone pushes a political agenda . 
  left wing media do it just as much . 
  we just happen to agree more with their agenda . 
  i see lies about trump every day in the left wing media , and even though i despise trump , it greatly annoys me and a lot of people think i 'm a trump supporter because i criticise it . 
  it quite possibly is working though , making his disapproval ratings higher . 
  the media smear campaigns against obama worked pretty well , so maybe the left thought it 's time to do the same thing . 
   cruel and unusual punishment has a lot to do with democracy . 
  what counts as cruel and unusual is up to each individual to determine . 
  human rights acts are all different . 
  the cairo declaration of human rights is very different from the echr . 
  there 's no such thing as being `` pro human rights '' . 
  which ones ? 
  everyone would come up with their own list of what human rights should be . 
  they are certainly not self evident . 
   it can not be used with any legitimate purpose in any circumstance . 
  absolutely it can . 
  [ read this ] ( http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/torture/ ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure 99 % of people would use torture in not even that uncommon of a circumstance . 
  parents torture their children all the time and most people do n't find it a problem . 
  the government doing it is n't much different . 
   do n't care about justice in any way whatsoever . 
  i can easily argue that since you are n't willing to mildly torture a captured terrorist to save 8 billion lives , that you are the one who does n't care about justice . 
  it 's a good attempt , do n't get me wrong , i just think you need to be aware of the limitations . 
  parties do n't give their views on the vast majority of issues so it 's impossible . 
  i could not find out basic positions for any of the candidates in my local elections . 
  they just say a bunch of platitudes like they support helping the health service . 
  even if they did give their views , it 's hard to say how much one issue should change the number . 
  it 's rather subjective which issues are important . 
  i have a few key issues ( like free speech ) that i consider fundamental to being left wing , but sometimes the `` right wing '' parties support these issues more . 
  most issues ca n't be fit in a particular place on the graph anyway . 
  where would you put parental leave ? 
  i can imagine all colours supporting it for different reasons . 
  the left supports forcing businesses to provide welfare to people that are n't working . 
  the right generally supports `` family values '' and opposes any kind of restriction on pregnancy ( abortion , contraception , gays , masturbation , etc ) . 
  the greens should oppose it because it 's bad for the environment , but green parties are ironically the most keen on it . 
  nationalist parties want more people for their nation . 
  not in 2015-6 surely ? 
  germany accepted an unprecedented number of immigrants then , 2 million in 2015 , probably a lot less in 2016 but still high . 
  you showed a source from 2002 lol . 
  it 's well known germany 's population was decreasing until quite recently , and the government saw that as a big problem so thought it would be ok to open its borders , even if the people that come in are the most illiberal people on the planet . 
  exactly . 
  they are being fundamentalists . 
  sticking to the letter of the law even though the ruling violates common sense . 
  in other cases though , the human rights laws are much more ambiguous and the judges do have to use common sense . 
  many of the articles of human rights have written in exceptions and those are up to judges to interpret however they want basically . 
  in particular , the limits on freedom of expression are basically that the government can jail you for anything :  the exercise of these freedoms , since it carries with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society , in the interests of national security , territorial integrity or public safety , ** for the prevention of disorder ** or crime , ** for the protection of health or morals ** , for the protection of the reputation or rights of others , for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence , or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary . 
  so if i say that it 's ok to be gay , i could be jailed for being immoral and it would but up to a judge to decide whether it violates the echr . 
  if i say black lives matter and it causes a riot , i could be jailed for causing disorder . 
  bridget bardot has been taken to court in france half a dozen times for criticising islam , and found guilty every time . 
  she wrote in 2004 :  over the last twenty years , we have given in to a subterranean , dangerous , and uncontrolled infiltration , which not only resists adjusting to our laws and customs but which will , as the years pass , attempt to impose its own . 
  this is what now qualifies as criminal racial hatred . 
  we need to undo all these bullshit hatred based laws as they are not applied consistently . 
  if they were almost all muslims in europe would be in jail . 
  if you 're not a fundamentalist , it means you can bend the rules a bit using common sense . 
  a human rights judge who is not a fundamentalist for example , might let you get away with torture if you had a good reason . 
  it 's not per capita , right ? 
  if you take in by far the most immigrants , it 's natural that your gdp will go up a bit , but per capita will not go up as much . 
  selling out your basic values for a minor economic gain is not such a good idea . 
  [ this post from a while ago ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/television/comments/56qpwp/guantanamo_bay_last_week_tonight_with_john_oliver/d8luysq/ ) is very informative about the situation in guantanamo . 
  unfortunately obama released a bunch of people before he left office . 
  * according to the most recent report , released sept. 2016 , 693 detainees had been released . 
  of that group , 208 had been confirmed ( 122 ) or suspected ( 86 ) of returning to jihadist activity upon their release ... obama 's own guant\u00e1namo review task force previously assessed all 52 of these detainees and determined that none of them -- not one of them -- should be transferred or released . 
  twenty-eight of the 33 detainees approved for transfer by the prb had been deemed `` too dangerous to transfer but not feasible for prosecution '' by obama 's task force . 
  the remaining five approved for transfer by the prb were referred for prosecution by obama 's task force . 
  but instead of being prosecuted , they have either already been transferred or will be .
