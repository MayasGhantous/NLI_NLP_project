  fidel castro and ch\u00e9 guevara both tried to get the ussr to nuke the usa , and hated the ussr for refusing to do so . 
  there were other times the ussr held back on firing its nukes too . 
  so you agree there is no solution then . 
  both sides claim jerusalem as their capital . 
  the majority of residents of east jerusalem want to remain part of israel , should they not have a say ? 
  a ) there are hundreds of millions of people that are `` distressed '' and in `` harm 's way '' . 
  is germany obligated to give visas to all of them ? 
  why is it only ones that make a dangerous journey and commit a crime are allowed in ? 
  human rights are n't dependent on how many people there are to claim them . 
  b ) it is forced if it 's `` against human rights '' , and the country is a signatory to the echr . 
  c ) 60 % of people in countries where refugees come from support the death penalty for apostasy . 
  you are extremely naive if you think the middle east [ is not the least liberal place on the planet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_in_the_world#middle_east_and_north_africa ) . 
  north korea may be less liberal , but that 's not the choice of the people there . 
  tunisia is the only country considered free , and they have sentenced a man to a year in jail for remixing a call to prayer . 
  middle eastern peoples have no respect for freedom of speech or freedom of religion , the 2 most core liberal values . 
  she supported remain but has no choice to go with brexit . 
  hard brexit is a misnomer , there is no such thing as a soft brexit . 
  leaving the eu is about a lot more than trade . 
   they were accepted because it 's again human rights to leave distressed people in harm 's way . 
  being forced to take in hundreds of millions of the least liberal people on the planet is not required by human rights laws . 
   he wan na make so russia respects human rights which human rights ? 
  their worst abuses of human rights are compliant with the echr , which is an awful document which does n't protect freedom of speech or freedom of religion at all . 
  none of these leaders care enough to try and `` save the planet '' , they just do a very minimum amount to delude people into believing they give a shit . 
  [ the greek prime minister referred to jerusalem as the capital of israel . 
  ] ( https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/93626-151126-israel-greece-embrace-the-future-of-energy-cooperation ), 
  israel has offered a 2 state solution a half dozen times . 
  the palestinians reject it every time and then people blame israel . 
  there is no solution . 
  neither side will ever give up their claim on jerusalem . 
   a theocratic shithole like iran ( re ) elects a moderate reformer that might actually be a reasonable person to talk to . 
  [ rouhani is far less moderate than erdogan or trump ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/12116458/irans-moderate-leader-is-nothing-of-the-kind.html ) , the media is extremely biased about him . 
  iran does n't have democracy , the supreme leader allows only a select few to even stand for election . 
  if rouhani was remotely moderate he would n't be allowed to stand . 
   since the `` moderate '' rouhani took office in 2013 , iran has embarked on what amnesty international calls `` a staggering execution spree '' , giving it the highest per capita state-killing rate in the world . 
  the targets for murder and imprisonment include journalists , christians and anyone who can be viewed as a political or religious dissident -- in obedience , as rouhani said in 2014 , to `` god 's commandments '' . 
   it gives the illiberal states like russia ( and increasingly turkey ) an even easier excuse to leave as well . 
  they do n't need to leave though , the echr gives them carte blanche to suppress freedom of speech and freedom of religion . 
  why free movement and not just higher immigration allowance ? 
  free movement means that canada can give out citizenship to anyone in the world and then send them all into the uk . 
  it 's an unnecessary risk to not be able to control immigration to your own country . 
   do people really think they would n't also have lower quality food in germany if they could get away with it ? 
  of course they would !, 
  but they ca n't , cause the law is pretty strict . 
  can you give some examples of strict laws ? 
  if a company wants to produce a product with a lower % of meat it 's surely not illegal to do so . 
  germans may be more picky due to history and the quality of local products . 
  czechia may have less competition for high quality products . 
  lots of smaller german companies might not sell across the border and provide more competition . 
  germans eat 20 % more pork per person , so maybe there 's more competition in quality . 
  czechia is land locked so it 's understandable fish is more expensive there . 
  so why is there no record of the vote ? 
  if you look up [ other bills ] ( http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2003-05-21&amp;number=212&amp;mpn=theresa_may&amp;mpc=maidenhead&amp;house=commons ) , they give you the vote totals . 
  the 2003 eu enlargement passed 491 to 0 for example . 
  [ you can look up an mps entire voting record ] ( http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpn=jeremy_corbyn&amp;mpc=islington_north&amp;house=commons ) . 
  croatia 's accession is not on there . 
  the only answer is that the vote was held in secret , or informally without a record . 
  why are people getting so mad in this thread denying the fact that sweden will be majority muslim in future , if muslims being the majority is not such a scary thought ? 
  the average age in many muslim countries is less than half of what it is amongst europeans . 
  it 's inevitable they will dominate the world population in future , and with climate change their own countries will be uninhabitable so the bleeding heart countries of europe like germany and sweden will let them all in . 
  there is no balance . 
  the muslim population increases everywhere , non-muslim population of europe is decreasing . 
  in many european countries the muslim population is doubling every 10 years . 
  it 's hard to imagine it ever decreasing . 
  can you imagine a mostly muslim city in europe being mostly non-muslims in future ? 
  it would never happen , yet the reverse is going to happen constantly . 
  99 % do n't rape , does n't mean they are good people . 
  a majority will support things like death penalty for apostasy , or that a woman should marry her rapist . 
  values like freedom of religion and free speech are n't common to the middle east . 
  if you watch near the end of voting , you can judge how political the votes are by [ how many right hand side countries got points ] ( https://youtu.be/398c_2-t4ty?t=1523 ) . 
  it 's not that common to see obviously political voting , where a country near last gets 12 points from its neighbour . 
  [ you can see detailed stats on the votes here ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/guide-political-voting-votes-eurovision/ ) . 
  there are a few well known voting pairs/blocks , but if you adjusted their votes to account for the political voting , the results would n't change very much . 
  a few countries would move up or down a few places , that 's all . 
  russia 's song was mediocre and was popular with the public only for the stage show . 
  the judges are all music based , so they do n't care as much about an elaborate stage show . 
  ukraine gave the most impressive vocal performance , it 's not like they did n't deserve it at all . 
  i never said he supported the ira . 
  [ he 's a fan of hezbollah and hamas ] ( http://markhumphrys.com/michael.d.israel.html#hezbollah ) . 
  he also has extensive ties to the muslim brotherhood , very recently visiting their mosque in ireland and praising them while they call for the killing of infidels . 
  do you see any proof of a vote there ? 
  if a vote happens , there will be a number showing how many voted for and against . 
   explain how that makes the us more progressive or left than europe . 
  i did n't say it 's more progressive on every issue . 
   most european countries put the limit at hate speech , inciting hate or encouraging discrimination . 
  `` inciting hate '' is a vague and illogical term that makes itself illegal . 
  free speech is much more important than the issues europe is more progressive in , and there are a lot of misconceptions about how liberal europe is . 
  yeah europe has free healthcare , but many european countries have a much lower tax rate than the us . 
   also you 're linking to a court case involving turkey , like that provides any usefulness . 
  that 's the european court of human rights , saying that jailing someone for criticising islam is acceptable . 
  it does n't matter if it 's turkey doing it , this is the european standard for liberal values . 
  if you criticise the echr you are a monster who oppose human rights according to people on this subreddit . 
  the echr also allows russia to jail people for saying homosexuality is ok , and to jail people for reading the bible in their own homes . 
  it 's already starting . 
  [ a lot of refugees are created by drought ] ( http://www.climatecentral.org/news/syrias-drought-worst-900-years-20087 ) . 
  it will continue to get worse gradually . 
  the entire middle east will likely be uninhabitable by 2050 . 
  look at how rapidly the populations are growing in the middle east africa and west asia - they wont be able to support anywhere close to that population with food and water , so what 's going to happen ? 
  they will move to europe . 
  either we be cold hearted about it , or it 's the end of western civilization . 
  it 's not just increasing temperature that is a problem .
