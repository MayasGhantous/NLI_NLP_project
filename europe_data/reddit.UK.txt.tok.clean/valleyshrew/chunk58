  sea levels will rise , and a lot of areas such as tel aviv will be underwater unless they build massive sea walls . 
  the plankton in the oceans will all die , and they produce a large amount of our oxygen . 
  by 2100 all life on earth could be [ suffocated ] ( http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2015/december/global-warming-disaster-could-suffocate-life-on-planet-earth-research-shows ) . 
  [ this is with a 4 degree rise ] ( https://urbalblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/2050.jpg ) , the previous link says it 's possible we are facing a 6 degree rise by 2100 . 
  [ the non-green countries here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_in_the_world ) are pretty strongly correlated with illiberal values . 
  [ as are the red countries here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_by_country_or_territory ) [ or here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/apostasy_laws_in_2013.svg/2000px-apostasy_laws_in_2013.svg.png ) . 
  because without the eu we do n't have freedom of movement for anyone , we can control our border and block people who want to behead cartoonists from entering our country . 
  the eu does not control its border , the individual countries do , which means any 1 of them can give all the people in those illiberal countries eu citizenship and they are able to all move freely within the eu . 
  no country should want to remain in such a union , and when the refugee crisis gets worse and worse the eu will collapse . 
  except the ira knew about the holocaust and it was just more reason for them to support the nazis as they hated jews . 
  [ they complained about jewish refugees fleeing europe ] ( http://markhumphrys.com/ira/4.a.jpg ) , and said `` the republic will rid the country of such vermin . '', 
   the brits were no different from the nazis how can you say that ? 
  it 's absurd . 
  the brits killed very few irish people . 
  are you a holocaust denier ? 
  it 's not proportional though . 
  malta gets 16 times as many seats as germany per population . 
   i wish most parliaments in the world were so little biased . 
  the smallest to largest seat by population in the uk is just 4x . 
  in the eu it 's 16x . 
  the us senate is the only place i can think of with such an undemocratic weighting , but they also have the house of representatives which is weighted more fairly . 
  by comparison , the eu 's 2nd branch of government has 200x vote weighting from smallest to largest . 
   how is it fair that say an irish vote has 2.5 times the weight of my vote ? 
  a person from malta has 16 times the weight of your vote . 
  the fact that all 28 member states have a separate foreign policy , and can pass european citizenship onto anyone in the world is n't a problem for you ? 
  in the us , imagine if vermont had the power to give us citizenship out to anyone it wanted . 
  it 's a catastrophe waiting to happen . 
  the eu needs central control on foreign policy or to get rid of freedom of movement all together , allowing 0.09 % of the eu population the power to screw over all the rest is totally unacceptable . 
  it may seem ok at the minute , but what 's going to happen when there are hundreds of millions of climate change refugees ? 
  malta can give them all eu citizenship , and then they are all free to move to germany , and germans can become a small minority in their own country . 
  i like when they sing in a native language , but he is a horrible singer and the song is terrible . 
  do n't understand how this could beat out finland or montenegro . 
  [ not as different as you might think ] ( http://markhumphrys.com/sfira.nazis.html ) . 
  `` oh here 's to adolph hitler , who made the britons squeal , sure before the fight is ended they will dance an irish reel . '', 
  - the ira 's war news , 23 nov 1940 , applauding nazi germany 's conquest of europe . 
  or maybe there is more to life than trade & economics . 
  i 'd rather have worse trade than be subject to the uncontrollable immigration of billions of the least liberal people on the planet . 
   they really think uk would get a free trade deal ? 
  the eu has free trade agreements with egypt , algeria , jordan and even syria !, 
  you really think they would n't also have one with the uk ? 
  why is it not true ? 
  europe has free trade agreements with many countries , including egypt , algeria and jordan . 
  none of those does it have free migration with . 
  how is it not a strong argument ? 
  especially when you consider the hundreds of millions of refugees there will soon be due to climate change . 
  the middle east is hugely overpopulated ( for example the average age in gaza is 17 ) and it will become almost uninhabitable due to climate change . 
  the eu has decided it 's ok with its culture and values being destroyed so as not to appear racist , and the brits disagree . 
  if changing lyrics makes it eligible why not change them in french still ? 
  this is just a distraction . 
  with 2 million refugees of course a small number will commit crimes , just as with 2 million random europeans there will be criminals . 
  what we must not forget is that the vast majority of refugees have an islamist ideology incompatible with a liberal democracy . 
  they do not want gays , women , atheists or cartoonists to be free . 
  crime is not an existential threat to our society , the media is way too focused on it . 
  what is to explain ? 
  the us clearly has more free speech and free religion than europe . 
  for example , the westboro baptist church are banned from entering the uk , which is a discrimination against their religious views , right to free speech , and right to peacefully protest . 
  all rights that are much more protected in the us . 
  [ you do n't go to jail in the us for insulting a religion ] ( http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng# { % 22itemid % 22 :[ % 22002-3733 % 22 ] } ) like you can in europe , where the human rights agreements allow for blasphemy laws and extremist restrictions on free speech . 
  in france bridget bardot has been convicted 5 times for criticising islamic traditions like how they slaughter animals . 
  did you even read my comment ? 
  do you think the eu has freedom of movement with egypt ? 
  clearly it 's not a requirement of a fta . 
  nowhere there does it say that there was a vote . 
  on the [ proper link ] ( http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/europeanunioncroatianaccessionandirishprotocol.html ) there is no evidence of a vote either . 
  where can i find out which mps voted for it and how easily it passed etc. ? 
  [ here is a complete list of theresa may 's votes ] ( http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?id=uk.org.publicwhip/member/41113&amp;showall=yes#divisions ) for example , nothing there about croatia accession . 
  the 2003 expansion did have a vote , you can see 490 aye , 0 nay . 
  the person was saying we should n't have joined in the first place , i disagreed . 
  i think it was rational to join , but at some point it also became rational to leave . 
  i think the main problem with countries joining is that they can never be kicked out . 
  allowing a country to join is a permanent decision and should n't be taken lightly . 
  every new country that joins makes the eu more unstable . 
  there are far left and far right governments in the eu now , it becomes very hard to make any progress . 
  do you have proof that the uk parliament voted on it ? 
  it should be easy to find online but i ca n't find any voting record . 
  because it 's one of the most contradictory and damaging things a government has ever done in human history . 
  thats why . 
  you 're scum trying to proselytize . 
  nice out of context quote you found there . 
  if you bother to read it you 'd see that i was saying human rights do n't do enough to protect free speech , and things like russia banning pro-gay speech does n't violate human rights agreements . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i supported brexit because of freedom of movement which destroys our environment . 
  i would strongly support the eu introducing tough environmental regulations . 
  that 's not eating my cake and having it . 
  france obviously does n't care about this issue , which other countries do n't have . 
  did the uk parliament vote on it or not ? 
  i ca n't find any proof of that . 
  that the government pushed for enlargement does n't mean the people supported it . 
  eu governments all wanted turkey to join too but i doubt a single country 's people supported that . 
  it just shows how big a risk it is to stay in the eu when it can make so many decisions so strongly against the will of the people . 
  when national governments make such decisions , they lose elections . 
  the british government has apologised for that ( cameron and blair iirc ) and the british people are ashamed of the government 's behaviour in those rare instances . 
  higgins on the other hand is not ashamed of his support of terrorism and his hatred of the western world . 
  you think 100 % of people who did n't vote opposed le pen ? 
  likely the people who did n't turnout were either ignorant of politics , or supported the candidates in roughly the same proportion as the people who did turnout . 
  why create so much pollution traveling 500km when macron had the easiest election victory in history ? 
  the eu should introduce laws to attempt to stop this kind of unnecessarily wasteful pollution . 
  lots of countries allow postal votes . 
  the irish have more tolerance for terrorist supporters like michael d higgins than the brits do . 
  except when we joined the eu it was just 9 countries , and we never got to vote on whether to accept in a further 19 of them .
