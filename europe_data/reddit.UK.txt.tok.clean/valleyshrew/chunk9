  they are not pacifists . 
  they are pro-war but they side with the enemy , so their name is doublethink . 
  [ here 's a brief list of things stop the war has said ] ( http://archbishop-cranmer.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/stop-war-coalition-urges-war-against.html ) : praised the `` internationalism and solidarity '' of isis , comparing them to the international brigades blamed the victims of the paris attacks and said france were `` reaping the whirlwind of western support for extremist violence '' supported the iraqi `` struggle '' against british troops `` by any means necessary `` said they `` stand with '' saddam hussein blamed the charlie hebdo attacks on the west compared assad to churchill promoted assad apologists refused to give syrians a platform on a debate about syria defended russia 's invasion of georgia appeased supporters of mahmoud ahmadinejad blamed the fifa corruption scandal on an israeli conspiracy opposed action to save the yazidis stranded on a mountain surrounded by isis defended putin over ukraine backed russia over crimea genuine headline on website said it is `` time to go to war with israel '' remember , these are views that have been [ endorsed by bernie sanders ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-jeremy-corbyn-delighted_55f4b19ce4b042295e369855 ) . 
  so you support firing someone that is too poor to afford a lot of food ? 
  or that considers wasting money on excessive amounts of food to be unethical given the environmental damage it causes ? 
  we should be encouraging people to be thin , even if it is less healthy than being average . 
  it 's a sacrifice that jesus would be proud of . 
  fat greedy people wont go to heaven . 
  it 's a great shame israel has to apologise and pay compensation for something they did that was legal and ethical . 
  the turks should be the ones paying compensation for their citizens trying to infiltrate into gaza with weapons and attacking israeli soldiers when they boarded the ships . 
  as usual , israel shows huge restraint and still gets demonized by everyone . 
  exponentially more fat people die every year from obesity related causes , but the law does not discriminate against them or there would be uproar about it . 
  at least in this case it is based on a doctor 's judgement and you can find a reasonable doctor . 
  israel did it by bmi of [ 18.5 ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/international/israeli-law-bans-skinny-bmi-challenged-models/story?id=18116291 ) which rules out plenty of healthy people including sports stars from appearing in adverts . 
  it 's not fair to discriminate against thin people just because some people have anorexia . 
  would you ban keira knightley or cheryl cole from appearing in adverts in france ? 
  movie stars and singers are a lot more influential than fashion models . 
  should movies have to feature only healthy people ? 
  anorexia is a disease , why should people with a disease not be able to have a job ? 
  france is abusing human rights here and i think it is illegal for any eu country to have a law like this . 
  people that have aids or cancer might become very thin , should they not be allowed to have a job either ? 
  if it 's health you are concerned about , it would be a lot more reasonable to ban smokers having jobs than to ban thin people from having jobs but there are a lot of fat politicians that smoke so they would n't be willing to discriminate against themselves . 
  trump may be right about some things but he completely ruined any potential credibility he had when he wanted to block muslim americans from returning to the country after being on holiday . 
  his reason does n't even make any sense - `` until we figure out what is going on '' , we know what is going on and we ca n't do much about it if some people want to be terrorists . 
   the reason why they can even get within arms length of these jews to stab them , is because they 're virtually all illegal settlers in their land in the first place . 
  20 % of israeli citizens are arabs and they have no problem getting within arms length of jews . 
  [ tel aviv ] ( http://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/two-people-stabbed-in-south-tel-aviv-circumstances-of-incident-unknown-434676 ) and [ kiryat gat ] ( http://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/initial-report-multiple-stabbings-in-kiryat-gat-434862 ) are not illegal settlements . 
  who said the uk wants to get rid of them ? 
  i ca n't think of any country in history choosing to `` get rid '' of territory against the will of the people in that territory . 
  no , they are [ separatists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_of_great_britain_and_ireland ) who already separated and want to steal more land from the british . 
  really nobody wants the northern irish and the uk got stuck with them . 
  the greek people were never in debt , never avoided paying taxes and never lived beyond their means , it was all the evil banks i tells ya !, 
  someone 's forgetting that democracy is government of the people , by the people and for the people . 
  you ca n't just scapegoat the government for all the bad stuff and pardon the people who elected them and supported their decisions . 
  greece has twice in a row elected a man who named his son after a guy that wanted to nuke the usa and openly hated the ussr for not letting him . 
  it 's pretty much the equivalent of if david cameron 's son was called adolf , the only difference is that adolf had the power to fulfil his evil ambitions while ch\u00e9 guevara did not . 
  it appears you do n't have the facts on this . 
  [ try some reading ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaza_flotilla_raid ) :  on the turkish ship mv mavi marmara , according to israel 's own report , the israeli navy faced resistance from about 40 of the 590 passengers , including ihh activists -- described in an israeli report as a separate `` hardcore group '' [ 2 ] [ 3 ] -- who were said to be armed with iron bars and knives . 
  [ 4 ] during the struggle , nine activists were killed including eight turkish nationals and one turkish american , and many were wounded . 
  on 23 may 2014 , a tenth member of the flotilla died in hospital after being in a coma for four years . 
  [ 5 ] ten of the commandos were also wounded , one of them seriously . 
  [ 4 ] [ 6 ] where did you get `` there is no evidence that passengers violently attacked the soldiers '' ? 
  it 's quite clearly false . 
   and the gaza blockade is far from legal . 
  `` united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon announced a parallel probe in august 2010 by a four-member panel headed by geoffrey palmer . 
  the palmer report was published on 2 september 2011 after being delayed , reportedly to allow israel and turkey to continue reconciliation talks . 
  the report found that the israeli naval blockade of gaza was legal , and that there were `` serious questions about the conduct , true nature and objectives of the flotilla organizers , particularly ihh '' . '', 
  seems you are wrong again . 
  the ships were given a command to turn around over the radio , and they replied : ` go back to auschwitz ' , answered one ship , and another responded , ` jihad , jihad , jihad ' . 
  if they were genuinely bringing aid to gaza they would have been allowed to take it via the land crossing but they instead wanted to provoke israel into defending itself so that they could play the victim to the media and people like you fell for it . 
  basically , you 're a terrorist apologist . 
  a better example is erdogan saying : `` those who condemn hitler day and night have surpassed hitler in barbarism , '' about israel defending itself from 16,000 rockets fired into its territory . 
  that 's a lot more justifiable than shooting down a jet that 's straying into your airspace for 17 seconds , and he said they 're worse than nazis for it . 
  he also condemned israel for protecting its borders from a turkish vessel that sought to break the legal naval blockade on gaza . 
  the passengers violently attacked the israeli soldiers that boarded to take them to port in ashdod so that the cargo could be inspected before being taken to gaza to prevent weapons smuggling , and the soldiers defended themselves . 
  erdogan called it `` a cause for war '' . 
  that statement alone should have had turkey kicked out of nato for threatening war against a us ally . 
   ira never aimed civilians [ sure they did n't ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yi4fzhe.gif ) . 
  [ here 's the album ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vk-hls78o8 ) . 
  it sounds beautiful , cheers . 
  they did n't know much about him when they voted for him , just that he was very left wing and something different than blair or cameron . 
  now his disgusting views have been widely publicised such as his propagandising for iran , a country that hangs gay men , his support has dropped amongst liberals . 
  i do n't think that 's relevant at all . 
  what european countries believe in `` love your enemies '' ? 
  none of them . 
  this whole passage is disgustingly immoral because it is allowing your family and friends to be raped and murdered without you having the strength to protect them . 
  what europeans `` lend to your enemies without expecting to get anything back '' ? 
  christianity is evil , and it 's a good thing not a single christian country follows this passage to let evil people get away with whatever they want to do . 
   and also bear in mind that the overwhelming majority of so-called islamist terrorist attacks are actually hitting other muslims . 
  do muslims hate their own way of life too ? 
  there is no `` muslim '' way of life , there are different interpretations of islam and yes they very much do hate each other . 
   do you honestly believe that our `` freedom of religion '' is a stronger motive i did n't say that . 
  it is simply true that they hate our way of life . 
  whether that is the main motivation of terrorism is neither here nor there . 
   the west , killed more than half a million of civilians in iraq in this latest war of aggression alone not true at all . 
  80 % of the deaths were caused by the other side during the iraq war . 
  almost none of the civilian deaths were caused intentionally by the coalition forces . 
  `` counts of deaths reported in newspapers collated by projects like the iraq body count project found 174,000 iraqis reported killed between 2003 and 2013 , with between 112,000-123 ,000 of those killed being civilian noncombatants . '', 
  it was a war fought * for * the iraqis , and after the invasion the majority of iraqis in a poll supported the overthrow of saddam . 
  that it turned into a sectarian civil war was a foreseeable outcome and unfortunate , but it was n't the us that made the iraqi people violent . 
  that 's on them . 
  the us would have left pretty much straight away if the iraqis were peaceful . 
  how is it apartheid ? 
  it 's occupation , there 's a big difference . 
  arab israelis are not discriminated against in law . 
  arabs are free to buy land in israel , but the palestinians give the death penalty to arabs that sell land to a jew . 
  that 's the real apartheid in palestine . 
  he pointed out israel probably because israel wont take any syrian refugees despite being their neighbour so why should poland have to ? 
  yeah poland is in the eu so has to do whatever germany tells them to do , but that 's the legal argument , poland is being criticised on a moral level here while israel is not . 
  xenophobia means fear of ( read : hatred of ) foreigners . 
  how is it xenophobic to criticise a nation 's culture ? 
  there is no `` hatred of foreigners '' in admitting the reality that saudi arabian culture is of less value than french culture . 
  there is nothing there against individual people , who may or may not share saudi cultural values . 
  if they are from saudi arabia but share french cultural values and reject saudi values then there is no hatred towards them . 
  if it was simply xenophobia then the hatred would still be there . 
  they are just as capable as the french of having a moral culture but they * choose * not to and should be criticised for that . 
  that article is very biased . 
  the fact is that our foreign policy is part of our way of life . 
  we 're not going to stop supporting the one liberal democracy in the middle east just because muslim terrorists want to turn it into a 52nd islamic state . 
  bin laden said :  we also call you ... not to continue your policy of supporting the jews because this will result in more disasters for you .
