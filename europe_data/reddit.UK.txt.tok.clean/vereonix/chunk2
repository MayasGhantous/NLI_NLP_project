  i 'd love to just be able to hop on a bus and go to france , or italy . 
  but sadly to us you 're all just foreign people to us , we share boarders with no one , other countries can have blurred lines between them where culture and people cross over , we do n't . 
  we could be in the middle of the atlantic and we 'd notice no difference , and feel nothing change ( apart from the weather , possibly an improvement ) . 
  i know a lot of my friends simply do n't feel any relation to europeans , and yes i 'll say europeans as i too just do n't feel part of it . 
  it feels completely foreign to us , also like being stuck in a group project with people . 
  is not that you do n't not like the people but you really do n't care if you 're with them or on your own , and theres people who you prefer who are in other classes so you have your friends and do n't care about putting in too much effort making new ones . 
  also you must have been in a situation in a group where they make stupid suggestions which you do n't think is best , or wo n't suit your personal needs , but they wo n't listen to reason , or you just cba to even bother mentioning it . 
  it boils down to us just not being european , and as much as you say we 're in the eu etc , we just do n't care . 
  as we 're not a weak country who needs to be part of the eu like a lot of others do . 
  accompanied by the fact we 're not part of the continent we do n't get as much natural european stuff here , only immigrants , which adds to a superior feeling , that other countries , their citizens , are coming to us , the mighty united kingdom because we 're better than where they came from . 
  some people of-course think of how we once had the worlds largest empire , of sheer land mass and earth span . 
  it is hard to forget , plus we 're still a strong stable nation , we feel we do n't need to be part of a silly union , making silly blanket rules . 
  especially when if we left nothing would really affect us negatively . 
  also on a general level we have very little interaction with european countries , again due to the island nation thing . 
  this with the fact we speak english , we have a lot of media to and from america , honestly we forget we 're near continental europe , because it has no social impact on us for use to even register it in our minds that france is a few miles off our coast , and germany , denmark and norway are just over there as well . 
  i 'd be interested to see if other countries would class the uk as `` european '' ... oh also i think this will be true for most brits , when i hear `` european '' all i think off is france and germany , like the first thing that pops into our heads , not the eu , or `` yeah thats us '' . 
  as for you question about why we want to leave and no one ever really having an answer :  we would be free to trade with who we liked around the globe . 
  also , as the eu now sell us more than we sell them , trade between the uk and eu would continue as it always did . 
  germans and french will still sell us their cars , and we 'll still sell them our stuff , and they wo n't want to start a tariff war with us that they will lose . 
   apparently three million uk jobs depend on the eu , but twenty plus million european jobs depends on the uk . 
  trade will carry on regardless , as nobody can afford to lose business , not even them !, 
   you may need a ` passport ' to travel to germany and france ... imagine that ? 
  you always did do though . 
   britain would save # 53m a day in subscriptions it no longer had to pay . 
  vital money that is needed to build new schools , hospitals , houses , railways etc. 
  money that is needed to bolster rebuilding and overturn the lack of investment in our infrastructure for decades , whilst german and french infrastructure thrives off money thatwe paid in over the same timescale . 
   britain would take back it 's territorial waters , and along with it a fishing industry worth around # 26m every single day . 
  thousands of jobs would be created and thousands of taxpaypayers would start paying tax . 
   britain would take back it 's full agricultural industry , and start to grow food again rather than biofuels . 
  again , thousands of jobs will be created . 
   britain would stop demolishing power stations that are still needed , and would stop the madnesses of socalled green energy that puts 17 % on everyones lecky bills . 
   we would be able to take control of our own borders again . 
  the uk could become more like australia , that has a strict immigration policy of only letting people in that will benefit the country . 
  whilst most british people recognise that we need a certain amount of ` good ' immigration , it is currently out of control , and most people think it 's unsustainable to keep immigration at current levels of between 250000 and 300000 net migration levels every year . 
   if ukip has anything to do with us leaving , they will cut foreign aid to countries like india and pakistan that have their own aircraft carriers and space programs that we do not currently even have ourselves . 
  any downsides people give for us leaving is cancelled out a thousand fold by them benefits , people need to understand the uk is different , it is n't part of the continent and has issues which other countries do n't face . 
  the eu makes rules which screw us over because we 're an island , but they do n't seem to consider that we 're an island ... one point i really want to point out , is being able to control our boarders , i 've always wondered why we do n't have an australia style boarder control going on , considering we use to , and it is only recently i found out it is because of the eu . 
  i do n't know anyone who likes us being in the eu , or who thinks it is a good idea . 
  i 'm 22 , and this is based on friends , family , even uni professors . 
  just mute the sound ? 
  its the way it is to catch your attention . 
  i usually see skype flash or the pop up so i have it off , if i was a person who would n't notice the sound its perfect , as it ca n't blend into songs n ' such . 
  i always understood it to be like [ this tornado siren ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy_ox6surre ) really fucking weird and annoying so you notice it . 
  yeah ! , have in on a higher res map than this one . 
  i 'd find it really interesting , but it will probably just be a mess . 
  a better map ( not that is bad ) could be one just showing all past and current capital cities , regardless of if the country/city of which it would now be still exists or not . 
  i make that distinction ... 
  i assume everyone on the internet is mad :p my last comment was made from quickly looking at [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:colonization_of_the_americas_1750.png ) as for most speaking german , apparently :  [ over 50 million americans claim german ancestry , which makes them the largest single ethnic group in the country . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_language_in_the_united_states ) so at one point it might have been the most spoken , but i ca n't find anything to back me up xd, 
  if europeans and europe is irrelevant in this map , why is the map titled `` european discoveries '' . 
  as someone has already said a better title would simply have been western discoveries . 
  regardless interesting map , 
  i did n't think the dutch had much if any stake in the americas , nothing in north america and only a tiny impact in the south . 
  if anything i should alter it to be the spanish instead of german . 
  anyway i said german as i remember reading how at one point german was the majority spoken language in north america for a period . 
  some of this may be wrong so do n't get mad . 
   european discoveries  united states am i the only one who see the problem here . 
  the discoveries span before and after the signing of the declaration of independence , and i 'm sure the now us was n't considered part of europe , which back then pretty much just a physical continental term before the union . 
  back during the dates on this map the us was a mix of french , ~ ~ german ~ ~ * spanish ? 
  * and english mainly , i understand having them grouped under the us on there makes it easier , but it is n't europe . 
  wait wait wait ... poland is n't a member of the eu ? 
  so whats the benefit of being part of the eu ? 
  we can sell stuff in other countries more easily is the only actual in a way * physical * benefit i got out of all of them , and maybe he 1 law across all , but then as said each country will personalize most anyway . 
  i have a cold and feel completely out of it , so sorry if i 'm going full retard and missing points . 
  you seem to know a lot on this ( compared to me ) i 've always wondered what exactly we get out of being part of the eu ? 
  my initial view was that it was just an alliance like `` yeah we 're friends no bombing and invading each other , k ? '', 
  though i do n't see how that could change for the uk if we left , we wo n't go to war etc ( worst case ) . 
  what a do hear that does impact us are the silly rules they make us follow which ca n't be the same for every country as every country is different , green taxes and other stuff , energy costs , also dumb shit like bananas must be x long and x curved or they 're binned , same for potato sizes and other produce which costs our farmers millions ( they 're super market standards not market ofc ) . 
  also we do n't even use the euro and the pound is and always has been strong , i 've never really felt part of the eu , other than geographically . 
  well heres my view , which is nothing to do with `` dey turk ma jerb '' ... 
  i see the eu as a halfway house , a gathering that was formed after ww2 when countries were down on their luck , low on money and were all thinking : `` hey lets help each-other out for a bit until we get back on our feet and get some rules we agree on going '' which was totally fine for the 1950 's - 70 's , but now , looking at the uk , its a stable first world country , with a powerful economy , military , culture , currency . 
  being in the eu is just pointless now , its more for other countries to join for support so they can grow . 
  its like being 35 , married , kids , a car , a successful job ... but living with your parents . 
  its time to move out , you do n't need they telling you what do to , you agree with most of what they say , but you do n't need them telling you , you know . 
  you 'll take on board all they 've said , and most you 'll carry on with as its common sense . 
  others you want the freedom to do your own way , because you 're not your parents or sisters/brothers and you have unique matters . 
  but you 'll still talk to your parents , and have a great relationship with them , and you 'll discuss things , but it wo n't be forced upon you if you do n't agree . 
  as a mature adult you 'll be able to make your own decisions like you have been anyway for other matters ( for hundreds of years , and become pretty damn powerful from in the process ) . 
  thats my analogy , which i feel is the core of the whole argument , from that stems the specific issues like wanting to stop the ridiculous immigration , wanting to build nuclear power plants and stop shitty wind farms , to be able to trade more freely with other nations like china . 
  you do n't go into a hospital , get 100 % better , more so than before , than just stay because * reasons * . 
  i do n't know much on this , but from what i gather yeah , we 'd still be able to trade etc. 
  mainly because we 're such an economic force they ca n't really afford to stop . 
  i 'm sure there 'd be some extra wall to go through , but more a paper bag . 
  they could stop us but it would be against everyone 's interest . 
  this is one of the main reasons why leaving the eu is a perfectly reasonable course of action for the uk , as unlike other nations who join the eu for support , the uk can stand on its own and still have the benefits due to its economy , the pound , and various other situations .
