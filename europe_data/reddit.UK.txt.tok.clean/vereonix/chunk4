  the post in question i found to be very interesting , and being from the uk very informative , i 'd saddened i had to go to / r/european to read it : /, 
  it is n't wishful thinking , its utterly sad and depressing thinking on your behalf that we ca n't work together . 
  theres no point talking about this as you straight away go into absurdities , about abolishing the justice system which is on a national personal level , not an international level . 
  i find it very sad that you think the world is shit and that we 're all doomed , and ca n't work together . 
  regardless of the fact that we are , and are in longest period of peace on earth and in europe ever . 
   the nations of europe had a thousand years to work together '' in friendly cooperation '' for the benefit of all . 
  they ( almost ) never did . 
  so whats the eu then ? 
  it ca n't be nations of europe working together according to you , and if it is why do we need the eu for us to work together ? 
  either way you contradict yourself , as either we 're working together now in the eu at peace , so we can work together , so you 're wrong . 
  or we 're not working together now peacefully , so the eu does n't work ... so what the problem ? 
  you seem to think history is stationary and that we 're not developing , thousands of years of war is irrelevant when you look at how we are now . 
  ignoring that just makes you stupid . 
  we can all agree to a standard without being part of the eu . 
  just like most of the legislation and guidelines can be agreed upon and followed without the need for a political union . 
  standardisation is in everyone 's best interests , so there is no need to force costly changes on everyone , it 'd be better if its by choice and as a friendly cooperation . 
  if the eu did try and pass some bullshit to force every nation to change their railway systems it 'd piss nearly everyone off . 
  if you think people are getting annoyed at all this refugee business , there 'd be hell if they tried to have us change thousands of miles of railway and thousands of trains . 
  the eu need less integration through political force , and more mutual cooperation between sovereign nations for the benefit of all parties involved . 
  we use different measurements for different things , officially we use metric system . 
  however in general conversation we 'll say miles for traveling distance , or talk about a person 's height in feet n ' inches , but the height of a building or length of a garden in meters . 
  depending on the subject its easier to visualize and understand on a personal level . 
  i have no idea how far my work is in yards , but i know its 3 miles and can understand that easier , i 'm 6.2 '' saying 1.87 meter is just weird , its cultural thing , maybe it 'll change . 
   windmills you 're an idiot . 
  well lets look at the current state of wind and nuclear power production : large public wind turbines the ones the government stick in fields produce ** 700-kw to 1.65-mw ** depending on their manufacturer , and that is n't taking into account the unreliability of wind . 
  so if there were max level winds for 24 hours it would produce ** 16-mw to 39-mw ** now nuclear power plants , lets look at the usa 's smallest single reactor plant , that produces ** 502-mw ** , can can run at full capacity 24 hours a day , resulting in ** 12,000-mw ** ... 
  most do n't run 24 hours a day , but a single reactor can be larger and produce 1330-mw . 
  the best wind turbine would need to run for ** 34 hours straight as fast as it can ** to produce what a large single nuclear reactor produces in ** 1 hour ** ... then theres that we 're making thousands of these wind turbines , and [ the mining and creation of the magnets they use is creating devistating pollution ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1350811/in-china-true-cost-britains-clean-green-wind-power-experiment-pollution-disastrous-scale.html ) . 
  there also a lot of waste and pollution from where the actual turbines a build , due to the steel etc. 
  but ca n't find that think atm . 
  not to mention a power plant will also produce more jobs that the few people who maintain wind turbines .

  why ca n't we just be friends ? 
  i 'm not a fan of the eu , we 're all grown up big boy countries , lets just be friends and stop trying to get all clingy and up in each-others shit . 
  we 're all strong independent countries , with different ( albeit similar ) cultures , lets just be friends . 
  some like apples , some like oranges , lets not annoy each-other with us trying to restrict what the other likes . 
  being feasible , and being a good idea are 2 totally different things . 
  i do n't know anyone who says it is n't * feasible * , just that nuclear is better in every way , and does n't waste thousands of acres with massive eyesores that could be put to better use . 
  [ a better idea if you really want `` green '' energy is the tidal lagoon power .

  so the crisis is more that muslims are crazy . 
  losing faith in your religion should n't be a crisis , crazy people who still believe , and want to harass or kill you because of it is what needs to be addressed . 
  this is n't muslim specific , it happens to christians , and mainly mormons , and ofc scientology . 
  people losing faith in scientology should n't be looked at or matter , the crazy people still in scientology blackmailing and threatening you is what needs to be fixed . 
  but surely once they 're put in whatever eu country they are then they have the right to move around ? 
  the eu has legally accepted them in , and with eu freedom of movement could n't they just go wherever they want ? 
  i 've not looked up about the eu 's stance on refugees once they 're in the eu , like are they recorded and registered to 1 country , and if found in another classed as `` illegal '' , even though the eu has the schengen and free movement over borders . 
  people have kind of mentioned it , but none directly stated it ... you ca n't make them stay where you put them !, 
  its fine to say you all take your fair share , but you ca n't force them to stay . 
  like others have said about portugal/spain and easter europe , ~ ~ they 're ~ ~ they 'll just fuck off to germany/uk/france straight away . 
  such as ? 
  honestly , i 've read their manifesto , nothing is `` radical '' about them . 
  leaving the eu is `` radical '' i guess , but thats it . 
  if we did leave the eu we 'd get an australian style immigration system , all you 're best and brightest will be welcome and will be able to get in fairly easily . 
  depends whos life you 're looking at ...

  edit : [ ca n't forget a bit of the old ultra violence , now can we my fellow droogs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7fo3bzpebq ), 
  i agree , and with :  the snp has also proven that they can and do deliver on there promises . 
  i feel i address this well , and explain better [ in this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/348qwv/latest_uk_election_poll_map_with_constituencies/cqsk2zg ) as to why their popular . 
  as they 're able to address the needs of a very concentrated population . 
  its not i think the snp is a silly party , its that i think the overall uk system is a bit ridiculous in this regard . 
  dude , its the scottish nationalist party , they 're primary focus is scotland over everywhere else , and want to leave the union to get away from england and london . 
  they just want to give scotland more power , and do n't like england . 
  i personally like the snp , and i think some of their policies are very good and nicola sturgeon presents herself well . 
  that does n't change what the party stands for . 
   smaller regional assemblies would be closer to the people and , therefore , possibly more responsive ( while still being large enough to bring significant resources to bear on large-scale problems ) this sums up my feelings pretty well , and why i always bring up population . 
  scotland , northern ireland , and wales all have their own parliaments , but a population of only 3-5 million , compared to the population of england of 53 million . 
  having parliaments with such large power , over such a small population means the needs of their specific people can easy me brought to attention and met . 
  whereas england is at a massive disadvantage in this respect , with each region having next to no representation in london with any real power to help their region . 
  i 'm fine with it having one , i just feel the power scotland already has , and the power they 'll get in this election is wrong compared to the amount of people they 'll actually govern compared to the rest of the uk . 
  the snp seems very anti-english , but more so want to redirect the power and money channeled into london , but london is n't all of england . 
  i 'm from peterborough in the east midlands , with a population of 4.5 million ( the county not the city ) , we could make similar arguments the snp do , about the distribution of wealth etc. 
  yet scotland is a `` country '' and has its own parliament , and as such gets special treatment , such as free university fees . 
  another example , is wales and that they get free prescriptions , due to their parliament , but only govern a population of 3 million , 2.5 million less than the east midlands . 
  i find the snp insulting that it talks as if england is one homogeneous group , we 're not . 
  i feel the snp is an illustration of how things should be in the country , with a devolved system based on the [ level 1 nuts system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuts_of_the_united_kingdom ) with each group being of similar population , of around 3-5 million , with london being 8 million . 
  this illustrates just why i think scotland having its own party and so much power is ridiculous , it has such a small population . 
  we just need to devolve powers to the counties , the north west has a population of 7.1 million , scotland has 5 million , why the ne have its own parliament ? ... 
  even more silly is that northern ireland has a population of 1.8 million , birmingham has a population of 1.1 million ... 
  but ni has its own parliament . 
  damn , i thought i was on / r/european, 
  it probably happens in a lot of countries and by a lot of different cultures . 
  its just never in the touristy places people visiting would see . 
  living in a uk city its very obvious to me , and having only been tourist places abroad i 've not seen it , so to me its a very middle eastern people thing . 
  it still baffles me , if i wanted to badly to go and move to india , or japan , it 'd be because i like the country and its customs and how it works . 
  i 'd try to adapt and assimilate as much as possible , sure i would n't mind finding other british people to hang out with , but i would n't surround my self and block out the wonderful country i 've chosen to be part of because i apparently like it . 
  this applies more to middle easter muslims i think , but why when muslim particularly when they go to another country they apparently like and want to live in try so hard to make it like where they came from ? 
  try and enforce their laws , all group together where they live , do n't mingle with others , open muslim shops with arabic signs n ' food etc. 
  i do n't understand why a lot of those who come here try and make it like where they came from . 
  we 're getting a long just fine here how we are , and you want to come here because we 're doing fine ... 
  so why do they not want to mix with us and make it like where they came from . 
  the areas they infest are very hostile to natives , i just do n't understand . 
  its fine liking your culture , but its different to ours , and you want to live here so adapt ... 
  i 'm guessing i 'll get flack for this , its not an anti muslim comment , its a question , because its the state of affairs . 
  yeah !, 
  screw democracy . 
  should n't we be looking at why natives are n't have as many children , nations should n't be relying on immigration to `` prop '' up their population . 
  even then are they having more children per mother than the natives are ? 
  if not thats the same general population growth compared to current population .
