he 's a complete fucking rocket , i heard him on bbc scotland the other day and was amazed that the presenters managed not to laugh at his bile/populism . 
  beware of cycle paths during cold spells . 
  i used to cycle to work in all weathers , but i learned to avoid cycle paths during a hard freeze , as the snow/ice turns into a sheet of no-friction death . 
  are the netherlands colonising flanders via bicycle ? 
   i have to admit that the british one is not great - it is dull and dutiful rather than inspiring and beautiful . 
  i actually love the french national anthem . 
  i 'd have to agree . 
  it 's also quite odd in that it 's not really that commonly sung in scotland - i 've never heard it sung at public events , and i do n't think anyone is taught the words at school . 
  * and stood against him * ( * gainst who ? 
  * or * who 's that ? 
  * ) * proud edward 's army * ( * bastard !, 
  * or * wanker !, 
  thatcher draws a lot of ire in the central belt , but she did n't uproot an entire culture and replace it with sheep . 
  in the highlands of scotland ( and glasgow , whence a lot of highlanders ended up ) , the first duke of sutherland ( george granville leveson-gower ) , his wife elizabeth ( 19th countess of sutherland ) , and their factor ( a scottish term for a land/building manager ) patrick sellar are still viewed with hatred by some . 
  they were responsible for the clearances of large swathes of assynt and sutherland , and effectively destroyed the native gaelic culture of these massive districts , which are now famed for their emptiness . 
  there is a well-known pub in glasgow which has their portraits mounted inside the urinals . 
  the clearances of sutherland , aka * d\u00f9thaich ` icaoidh * ( mackay country ) is the subject of the saddest song i know * mo mhallachd aig na caoraich mh\u00f2r * ( i curse the great sheep ) . 
  are you a wizard ? 
  not really , it 's just the same as driving on the right but everything is reversed . 
  there 's no real advantage . 
  being able to think your feet ( wheels ) is useful though , as there are no standardised layouts for junctions or roundabouts in the uk . 
  ah right , i though you meant on the walk-in from the cairngorm car parks . 
  apologies , it 's the rock climber in me . 
  what ` camp ground ' is half way along the ben macdui path ? 
  it 's open subarctic plateau , wild camping only . 
  best neighbour : england . 
  worst neighbour : england . 
  it was talking about his mother . 
  i 've actually seen it twice on separate occasions , it 's a rail replacement service . 
  it 's quite grey generally , if you do n't like the sun ( like me ) , it 's a great place to live . 
  i did n't realise the first one was n't working , i can see it no bother , but i have res . 
  sometimes in glasgow the buses like to inform you that they 're [ not in service ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sfjbord.jpg ) and that [ they 're actually trains ] ( http://www.digdang.com/media/images/choo_choo_im_a_train__15396.jpg ) edit : fixed 1st pic, 
  probably not , given that they are assyrians and therefore part of various eastern orthodox/catholic churches . 
  i do n't think they 'll be found in any cofe churches unless it changes its liturgy massively and starts preaching in aramaic . 
  how much contact have hungarians historically had with scotland ? 
  it amazes me that our reputation for being tight would show up in hungarian jokes . 
  fuck you hungary !, 
  i like our * de facto * national anthem ( [ flower of scotland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpajhliiyjm ) ) for two reasons : ( a ) it sounds good on the bagpipes , and ( b ) it 's pretty rousing . 
  there 's nothing better than hearing a [ stadium full of people singing it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsja8zmurjy ) . 
  the lyrics are pretty good too : they 're about not obsessing over the past , but being aware of it and going into the future positively . 
  oh , and defeating the english in glorious battle . 
  technically , * god save the queen * is the national anthem of all the home nations , but it 's very rarely sung in scotland outside of official events , e.g. 
  where the queen is actually present . 
  i do n't know the words anyway !, 
  afaik tapwater is safe to drink without boiling in 99 % of scotland , unless there 's been a burst pipe or a localised problem with e. coli or cryptosporidium . 
  i 've never heard of anyone boiling tapwater as a matter of course . 
  * if you ca n't do the bouncy ( jumping up and down ) , you 're a catholic * , which is sung by certain supporters of rangers ( traditionally protestant ) when playing celtic ( traditionally catholic ) . 
  water supply and sewage treatment in scotland are provided by a statutory corporation called scottish water , and the price ( which is paid as part of local council tax ) is set by a separate regulator . 
  there is also an independent regulator which monitors water quality . 
  scottish water are a pretty good bunch : they 've improved their assets massively over the last decade or so , and are much more efficient than the previous system ( regional water boards ) . 
  they 've even found a way of making money privately via scottish water international , who provided water supply/engineering expertise to foreign companies/countries , and have worked in poland , canada etc. 
  it 's gone to extra time !, 
  in scotland there are two ( that i know of and have visited ) clootie wells . 
  one is at culloden , and the better-known one is near munlochy on the black isle . 
  basically , a clootie well features ( a ) cloots ( cloths ) with messages/wishes written on them , ( b ) trees and ( c ) a well/spring dedicated to a celtic saint . 
  you write your wish on your cloot , dip it in the well water , and tie it round a tree/branch . 
  here 's some [ pictures ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pw18xbq ) of the munlochy [ clootie well ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ggjne1b.jpg ) , which is the most popular, 
  that carbid schieten thing is absolutely mental , especially the last clip there . 
  why would anyone set off a small bomb in their living room ? 
  what did they think would happen ? 
  when i was growing up ( village in west-central scotland ) , guising was similar to the american tradition of ` trick or treating ' , but not the same . 
  you did n't just turn up at your neighbour 's door and demand sweets : you had to earn them . 
  this typically took the form of a poem , song , or comedy sketch . 
  scotland : we tend to make up names for the people who live in rural/remote regions , rather than the places themselves . 
  * the back-arse of beyond . 
  * the term ` teuchter ' ( chookh-tur ) is applied to people who live in rural areas of the highlands and aberdeenshire/moray , or basically anywhere that is n't glasgow . 
  * people from aberdeen and the northeast of the country are universally known to engage in sheep romance , so they are called sheepshaggers . 
   also do you actually want more and more european teams out of this world cup nur england , und das ist schon passiert . 
  this story is only talking about the english school system ( which features free schools and specialist academies ) . 
  there is no such thing as the ` uk education system ' , there are several uk education systems . 
  for instance , this problem does not exist in scotland because we do n't have free schools or specialist academies , and i believe this is also the case in wales . 
  scot here , i am very happy with the outcome of the match , as a support of a.b.e. 
  ooft !, 
  hard hitting . 
  registering a title deed in scotland typically requires the service of a solicitor , as you have to make sure the deed [ conforms to the following ] ( http://www.ros.gov.uk/customerservices/registeradeed.html ) : * conform to the land registration ( scotland ) act 1979 * meet the requirements of writing ( scotland ) act 1995 . 
  * where appropriate deeds must demonstrate they meet stamp duty land tax requirements in line with part 4 of the finance act 2003 . 
  her majesty 's revenue and customs ( hm revenue & customs : stamp duty land tax ) will be able to advise you of their particular requirements . 
  * discharges of standard securities should conform to the style laid down in schedule 4 , form f of the conveyancing and feudal reform ( scotland ) act 1970 simple , eh ? 
  there 's a completely different process for doing the same thing in england and wales . 
  the website for the registers of scotland does n't seem particularly user friendly when compared to its equivalent for [ england and wales ] ( http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public/property-ownership ) , which is a separate jurisdiction . 
  there is a central , publicly accessible registry , administered by the [ registers of scotland ] ( http://www.ros.gov.uk/ ) ( which includes the register of sasines , i.e. 
  property transfer documents ) , but [ only 26 % of land ] ( http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/who-owns-scotland-find-out-in-10-years-time-1-3422031 ) in scotland is registered in it , which the registers of scotland should increase to near 100 % when some new legislation comes into force this year . 
  ** scotland ** * the mackintosh building at the glasgow school of art was [ severely damaged in a fire ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-27556659 ) , just a few days before the annual degree show . 
  the building is regarded as one of the finest examples of art nouveau architecture in the world , and the scottish and uk governments have already pledged money towards its restoration . 
  * neil lennon , the manager of scotland 's most successful football team ( at the moment ) , [ resigned ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/22/neil-lennon-resigns-celtic-manager ) , prompting much debate as to who will replace him . 
  * the final round of ticket sales for the glasgow 2014 commonwealth games was suspended and [ reopened after technical problems ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-27492877 ) thought to be caused by the level of demand . 
  i got tickets for the badminton !, 
  * a [ report ] ( http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/review/land-reform/events/finalreport23may2014 ) commissioned by the scottish government proposed reforms to land ownership in scotland . 
  this is widely viewed as inequitable , and the report makes 60 recommendations , including the following : the owners of land should be identified in a public register ; the powers of the crown estate should be devolved to the scottish parliament ; the community ` right to buy ' should be strengthened and more funding made available ; local authorities should be given more powers over vacant/derelict urban land ; tax loopholes related to land ownership should be closed ; there should be an upper limit on the amount of land that an individual or single concern can own . 
  the european union 's general interests include the opera , long walks on the beach and bdsm . 
  will there be any sweet transvestites ? 
  i reckon these songs are difficult to dislike : \u00d2ran na cloiche : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w7qm8x2ede the skyscraper wean song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmndwtvatpg, 
  dragostea din tei was very popular in my scottish secondary school during 2001-2002 . 
  it was , as we 'd say , a pure good choon . 
  ** scotland ** * lanark * by alasdair gray . 
  it depicts glasgow in both realist and dystopian terms , and is a wonderfully bizarre and real description of that sprawling , contradictory city . 
  * trainspotting * by irvine welsh . 
  this is a wonderfully free-flowing novel written in rapid-fire edinburgh dialect . 
  it depicts the gritty , scummy , grey side of life that anyone who has grown up in urban scotland will instantly recognise . 
  * the hydrogen sonata * by iain m. banks ( rip ) .
