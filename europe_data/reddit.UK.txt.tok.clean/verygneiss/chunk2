  this is a no-holds barred space opera , with no pretensions to being anywhere near sci-fi . 
  godlike ais with mischievous senses of humour , a utopian anarchist society of warrior pacifists , and the remarkably poignant main plot line - a society that has opted to leave this plane of reality , but which has been manipulated for millenia . 
  i hope that 's an anti-mcdonalds jibe , pal . 
  i would n't necessarily say that . 
  there was a lot of scaremongering about polish people in the uk tabloid press between 2005 and 2009 ( roughly ) . 
  exercise : i run between 15 and 30 kilometres a week ( on and offroad ) , take part in outdoor/indoor rock climbing , go hillwalking , and play badminton once or twice a week . 
  facilities used : streets/trails , mountains/cliffs , local rock climbing centres and local sports centres . 
  ** scotland ** on the whole , well liked . 
  they are often stereotyped as being tradesmen ( plumbers , builders , joiners etc. ), 
  and overly religious ( many catholic chapels hold services in polish ) . 
  i 've never encountered anyone who is vehemently anti-polish . 
  ** scotland ** rolling painted eggs down hills is fairly common in my home shire , but not much else other than that . 
   and also scots ( well , particularly glaswegians ) understand sectarianism in a way than the english and the welsh really do n't ... that does n't mean we want any more of it . 
  * today * on bbc radio 4 ( the most respected current affairs/news programme in the uk ) has just announced that the bbc acting bureau chief for moscow , kevin bishop , is wandering around inside the - apparently abandoned - presidency in kiev . 
  no sign of yanukovych , and the opposition seems to be in control the grounds , according to his [ twitter account ] ( https://twitter.com/bishopk ) , but the building itself is locked . 
  edit : factual clarification . 
  oh , i understand the notion of being proud of your heritage , and the vast majority of scots canadians ( my family ) i 've met do not adhere to the jingoistic/sentimental view of scottish culture . 
  the ones that do , however , stand out , so i suppose i 'm suffering from a case of reporting bias . 
  it 's like good service in a shop : you only complain about the one incidence of bad service , and never mention the hundreds of incidences . 
  canadians still ca n't drive , i ca n't help you about that . 
  scotland here : the ` muh heritage ' types are pretty amusing , and i usually try to eliminate their misconceptions gently . 
  but i ca n't be overly critical , as 2/3rds of the family that i know are 1st or 2nd generation scots canadians ( or whatever you want to call them ) , and none of them adhere to the aforementioned stereotypes . 
  my favourite scottish word : * broch * : in ipa , [ ` b\u027e\u0254x ] or brokh in a broader transcription . 
  it 's a type of circular fortress built by the picts , and they 're most common in the far north of the country . 
  my favourite insult : * fannybaws * ( fanny-bawz / [ ` f\u00e6n\u026a ` b\u0254z ] ) is a uniquely egalitarian insult , literally meaning * vaginatesticles * . 
  it 's austere , dark , and generally a good watch . 
  i love scandi dramas ( along with the rest of the country ) , e.g. 
  * the bridge * , * the killing * , * borgen * , * wallander * etc. 
  i particularly enjoyed the second series of * the bridge * , because the bad weather , concrete and bleak landscapes reminded me of home . 
  i do n't there 's much to criticise here , it 's an internal decision made by the populace , under - as you say - one of the purest forms of direct democracy in the world . 
  * scotland were beaten 0-20 [ by england ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/26075972 ) at the rugby , but it 's more about the getting drunk and singing the national anthem , than the actual winning . 
  * the scottish government is [ planning to inform ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/07/female-genital-mutilation-scotland-schools-headteacher-fgm ) schools/parents of the warning signs/dangers of female genital mutilation ( fgm ) . 
  the english education minister is yet to issue a similar statement , which has drawn criticism . 
  * the justice committee of the scottish parliament [ has been scrutinising ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26060552 ) the criminal justice bill , and most of the committee 's members have recommended against the provision which would remove the requirement for corroboration in scottish criminal cases . 
  this is the rule that requires evidence in criminal proceedings to come from at least two independent sources , i.e. 
  not just the testimony of one person against the other . 
  this is very controversial : it was supported by lord carloway ( a senior judge appointed to review the law of corroboration ) , but the most senior high court judge , lord gill , supports keeping corroboration , as do many [ solicitors and advocates ] ( http://scottishlegal.com/index.asp?cat=news&amp;type=criminal&amp;newsid=53760 ) . 
  * the uk foreign office has been accused of meddling in scottish affairs by [ writing to spanish newspapers ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/foreign-office-caught-asking-spanish-press-to-undermine-scottish-independen.23387895 ) to get them to print anti-independence press releases . 
  why not ? 
   trainspotting ( central belt ) naw , just edinburgh . 
  * gregory 's girl ( coming of age comedy set in a new town ) . 
  * [ red road ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsfy6upaxkq ) : gloom , crime and high rises , set amid the soviet landscape of glasgow 's housing estates . 
  well you probably know where you 're from , you just do n't memorise the counties/la areas in school . 
  i went to normal scottish state schools , and we were never really taught the administrative subdivisions of scotland ( local authorities ) , because it 's not that important and most folk 'll pick them up . 
  england is pretty much terra incognita for me : it 's local government system is multi-layered and bizarre . 
  i 'm just having a whinge , this thread is about having a whinge . 
  i know it 's an unpleasant situtation for ruk students , but it 's just a quirk of the system . 
  ** scotland ** * it 's been raining for months , thanks jetstream . 
  * toxic football culture . 
  * tourists can not drive and do not know the etiquette for single track roads . 
  * roads are terrible . 
  * english students complain about tuition fees all the time . 
  * the secondary education system has just been reformed for no apparent reason . 
  people who most commonly come from england or further abroad , thinking that living in the highlands is a magical fairytale , stay for a few years , then generally leave , disillusioned with the whole affair . 
  they frequently open up b&b s or cafes . 
  it 's not slang . 
  ** scotland ** i am a glaswegian who has lived in the highlands , so here are my hybrid stereotypes . 
  glaswegians : rough , prone to fighting and religious/football bigotry , but friendly ( `` you 'll be wanting your tea then ? '' ) . 
  edinbuggers : posh , aloof , unwelcoming ( `` you 'll have had your tea then ? '' ) . 
  highlanders : friendly and welcoming , but less so with white settlers . 
  highlanders enjoy deer stalking and discuss rifles frequently . 
  lewisians : stern , presbyterian , no fun on sundays . 
  aberdonians : sheep shaggers . 
  borderers : sheep shaggers . 
  galwegians : sheep shaggers . 
  ayrshire folk : in the orange order . 
  st andrews : full of americans and the english . 
  east coasters in general : most of their sentences are constructed from the words * braw , ken , and eh * . 
  glasgow : you should know that i kent yer faither . 
  select the 240p quality in the bottom right , it seems to be on high quality by default . 
   a guy i know got arrested after throwing a coke bottle and nigel farrage at a protest in aberdeen holy crap , your pal must be strong . 
  what 's the point ? 
  i 'd prefer to use my sundays to do something fun and unrelated to the kirk . 
   should n't that read `` most homoerotic '' head of state ? 
  most homoerotic ? 
  any more of that language and you 'll be cooling off in the gulag !, 
  edit : duhhhh, 
  to be fair , ukip rarely make the headlines for their activities in scotland , as they 're very much a fringe party . 
  i included this because the guy is a complete rocket , and the story is quite a humorous read . 
  ** scotland ** * following a massive manhunt in edinburgh , the body of 3 year old mikaeel kular was found in fife . 
  a report has been sent to the procurator fiscal , and his mother has [ been charged in connection with his death ] ( http://news.stv.tv/east-central/260830-police-scotland-confirm-woman-charge-over-mikaeel-kular-death/ ) . 
  there 's no word on what she 's actually been charged with , but i suspect it 'll be murder or culpable homicide . 
  * vladimir putin , the world 's manliest head of state , has stated that [ russia is not interested ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/putin-russia-has-no-interest-in-scottish-independence.1390132065 ) in the outcome of the upcoming independence referendum . 
  * a member of the right-wing fringe party ukip has stated that glasgow city council ( the largest in scotland ) is run by [ gays , catholics , communists ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/ukip-chair-claims-glasgow-council-for-gays-catholics-communists-in-online-rant.23212831 ) , islamists , and that the scottish parliament is anti-protestant . 
  * human remains discovered in argyll have been shown to be those of yulia solodyankin , [ a russian student who went missing in june ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-25787247 ) . 
  francois hollande is big news on the bbc . 
  the fact that the french media is n't really reporting his alleged affair is viewed as very interesting , as it contrasts with the uk 's approach to the private lives of politicians , i.e. 
  they 're not allowed to have one . 
  if david cameron had been caught shagging , there 'd be a national outrage , and he 'd probably end up resigning . 
  ban this filth !, 
  scenes like this would 've been common in glasgow too , if the financial crisis had affected the city and scotland in the same way it affected ireland . 
  we 've got a huge stock of high-rise blocks of flats , which are generally unpleasant and decaying , so the council and various arm 's - length housing bodies are currently demolishing or refurbishing a lot of them . 
  scots in the modern sense are a mixed people : a mixture of the picts , britons ( p-celts ) , irish ( the scotti , q-celts ) , anglo-saxons and the norse ( particularly in the northern isles and na h-eileanan ) . 
  i 'm not sure how the cartographer would 've represented that , or if such a history would have fitted in with the racial understanding of the cartographer . 
  never forget , all maps are political !, 
  all the best scottish folk tunes are about smiting/rising up against the english . 
  the anthem is even about a battle that occurred 700 years ago next year . 
  brambles = moras ; blaeberries = blueberries = myrtleberries . 
  raspberries = raspberries . 
  my favourite scottish desert is [ cranachan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cranachan ) .
