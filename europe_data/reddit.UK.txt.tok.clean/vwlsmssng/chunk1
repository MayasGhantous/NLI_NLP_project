[ esholt ] ( http://www.coachholidaynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/esholt-village-1-woolpack-pub-yorkshire-england.jpg ) , one of the shooting locations for the emmerdale farm tv programme , is not unlike where i live . 
  the photo i linked to is of [ gunnerside ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/gunnerside,+richmond/@54.37941,-2.0746647,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487c15123cecd28d:0xeb1de4444cc6cdfd!8m2!3d54.37941!4d-2.072476 ) . 
  i live in neither place but at a first glance you would n't tell them apart ,, 
  i suspect most brits , like me , do n't think about them or would even know who or what they are if asked . 
  their amateurish website for the uk ( i 'm not linking to them ) claims a heritage going back to [ the battle of cable street ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzkv5gjozta ) when there was a real threat from fascists . 
  however ...  the battle of cable street still holds a proud place in anti-fascist memory , considered a decisive victory against the far right . 
  in fact , the event boosted domestic fascism and antisemitism and made life far more unpleasant for its jewish victims , explains daniel tilles . 
  http://www.historytoday.com/daniel-tilles/myth-cable-street the extreme right in the uk are not organised or effective and are effectively opposed by the mainstream of politics who respectfully engage in meaningful debate with each other . 
  i moving soon , the house i 'm selling could be dropped into the middle of [ this village ] ( http://c7.alamy.com/comp/attx5t/gunnerside-village-swaledale-yorkshire-dales-national-park-england-attx5t.jpg ) and it would n't look out of place . 
  the weight of the stone walls and stone roof makes me wonder why the building does n't collapse or sink into the ground , but it has stood for over 150 years . 
  these house are either very small cottages like mine , originally with one room downstairs and one upstairs , or old barns that have been converted into big houses . 
  having taken a quick look at [ commission regulation ( ec ) no 2257/94 of 16 september 1994 laying down quality standards for bananas ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=celex:31994r2257:en:html ) it is easy to spot what the british contribution to the rules was :  - free from any foreign smell and/or taste . 
  in part 2 : whose grass is greener ? 
  if the rest of europe fast tracked their own exits from the eu and left us as the only member with all the parliament , regulations and bureaucracy to manage . 
  the strasbourg civil servants would be relocated to swindon and the brussels bureaucrats to bracknell . 
  we would have to manage going to war while ensuring our army rations were correctly provisioned with eu approved bananas and cucumbers . 
  put wood inth ` ole  if somebody enters a room and neglects to close the door , this is what you say to them ( translation : `` put the wood in the hole '' ) . 
  it is mainly used by great uncles and people called archie , but the expression appears to be in less frequent usage than it once was . 
  the reason for this is that in the old days , if somebody entered a room with a fire going and did n't put the wood in the hole , the heat would escape . 
  nowadays , because of central heating , it 's not necessary to trap heat in one room by closing the door .

  [ wikipedia : the battle of britain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_britain ) interestingly it was n't just the british fighting  the royal air force roll of honour for the battle of britain recognises 595 non-british pilots ( out of 2,936 ) ...  these included 145 poles , 127 new zealanders , 112 canadians , 88 czechoslovaks , 10 irish , 32 australians , 28 belgians , 25 south africans , 13 french , 7 americans , 3 southern rhodesians and one each from jamaica and mandatory palestine . 
  i 'm not a historian , my understanding is that the british raf kept the german luftwaffe at bay through effective command and control of the raf squadrons so they only flew when necessary and were more likely to find their targets . 
   the dowding system dramatically improved the speed and accuracy of the information that flowed to the pilots . 
  during the early war period it was expected that an average interception mission might have a 30 % chance of ever seeing their target . 
  during the battle , the dowding system maintained an average rate over 75 % , with several examples of 100 % rates -- every fighter dispatched found and intercepted its target . 
  in contrast , luftwaffe fighters attempting to intercept raids had to randomly seek their targets and often returned home having never seen enemy aircraft . 
  the result is what is now known as an example of `` force multiplication '' ; raf fighters were as effective as two or more luftwaffe fighters , greatly offsetting , or overturning , the disparity in actual numbers . 
  [ winston churchill 's quote about the raf pilots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/never_was_so_much_owed_by_so_many_to_so_few )  never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few , has historically put the focus on the pilots , but the in depth wikipedia article show how many other factors and people made winners of one side and losers of the other . 
  uk tv is a better way to watch american tv than on american tv . 
  when the daily show was on free to air tv for a time in the uk it ( iirc ) had just one commercial break . 
  try to watch the same programme in the us and it is so frustrating as the commercial content swamps the show content . 
  children 's tv channels in the uk are educational and informative as well as entertaining with live humans , not cartoons . 
  often the content is child centred and from their point of view . 
  think of sesame street but the whole channel of varied content with that quality and ethos . 
  the bbc have two children 's channels that are aimed at different age ranges : [ cbeebies ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies ) and [ cbbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc ) . 
  american style channels , { nickleodeon , disney } are available in the uk but the content seems to be jam without the bread . 
  bbc news programmes have interviewers acting as advocates for the public and differing points of view . 
  interviews with politicians and experts appear to be comfortable paced , respectfully done and with enough time for issues to be dug into . 
  we do n't have the mass of pundits and partisan commentary that seems to permeate us news channels . 
  us news interviews also seem to be about chasing the soundbite or the interviewer get his opinion across above that of the interviewee . 
  ay , the french and their cooking .

  or else order a royale with cheese .

  however ...  literally government-controlled media , uk ; the bbc , the worlds oldest and largest national broadcasting organisation , may be seen as part of the establishment and representing a particular set of values but it is * not * government controlled .

  what about when your talking about hands rather than feet ? 
  this has been discussed very recently in this year 's reith lectures broadcast on bbc radio 4 . 
   the philosopher and cultural theorist kwame anthony appiah argues against a mythical , romantic view of nationhood , saying instead it should rest on a commitment to shared values . 
   he explores the history of the idea , born in the 19th century , that there are peoples who are bound together by an ancient common spirit and that each of these nations is entitled to its own state . 
  he says this idea is a mistaken one , illustrating his argument through the life story of the writer who took the pen name italo svevo - meaning literally italian swabian . 
  he was born a citizen of the austro-hungarian empire and became a citizen of the new republic of italy , all without leaving his home city of trieste . 
  appiah argues that states exist as a set of shared beliefs rather than membership of some sort of mythical and ancient group . 
  `` what binds citizens together is a commitment , '' he says , `` to sharing the life of a modern state , united by its institutions , procedures and precepts . '', 
  kwame anthony appiah is an american citizen . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00729d9 the bbc have published recordings of this lecture series going back to 1948 when bertrand russell discusses authority and the individual . 
  -- personally speaking , i believe citizenship is understood in the uk to be something associated with shared values , e.g. 
  respect for democracy and your fellow man , loyalty to the country , community involvement , an appreciation of our national history . 
  [ the national memorial arboretum ] ( http://www.thenma.org.uk/ ) in staffordshire , uk . 
   commemorates : the men and women of our armed and merchant services who have lost their lives in conflict , as a result of terrorist action or on training exercises since the end of ww2 . 
  unlike the world war memorials in towns and villages across the nation , there is nowhere else that records over 16,000 names of those who have been killed on duty in recent times . 
  the central armed forces memorial starts with the first military man to die after wwii and lists all subsequent service deaths . 
  it has a [ sculpture showing a fallen soldier ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8115/8685516881_9b45bef1b5_b.jpg ) being lifted by two other soldiers ( a woman and possibly a ghurka ] whilst another figure ( a ghost ? ), 
  points the way for the fallen man through a gap in the memorial wall . 
  a fifth figure is carving on the wall `` we will remember them today , tomorrow , forever . '', 
  the sculpture places the memorial firmly in the latter part of the twentieth century with it representation of the relationships and diversity of our historical and modern forces , distinct from the standing alone tommy atkins figure of the ww1/ww2 memorials . 
  the '' [ more about memorials ] ( http://www.thenma.org.uk/whats-here/more-about-the-memorials/ ) '' section gives a flavour of what can be found here .
