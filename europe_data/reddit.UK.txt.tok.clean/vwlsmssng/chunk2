  there are pro-exit commentators saying the remain campaign were exaggerating the negative effects of both leaving the eu and deciding to leave the eu . 
  they create strawman arguments that place them as victims of a conspiracy and misfeasance then go on the attack using the present absence of future circumstances as an absurd form of evidence . 
  as / u/theholygoatman said ,  it 's like a trainwreck happening in slow motion the bank of england got a lot of criticism for its less than glowing forecasts for brexit .

  but the dutch are orange people are n't they ? 
  understandable though given the great history of the british empire .

  this is an oddly phrased question implying that black people in europe are either muslim or african . 
  we do n't look at people and say he is a muslim and he is not , unless they are dressed in the typical clothing of a recent immigrant from the asian sub-continent and have a long beard . 
  a lot of muslims just blend in . 
  africans who are recent immigrants may stand out due to style of dress or accent , the majority of black people in the uk are afro-caribbean and their culture has become integrated with british culture , particularly since the '80s and the influence of ska and reggae music on british pop ( e.g. 
  the specials , ub40 , soul to soul ) , and the integration of immigrants to the point they are an integral part of the establishment * [ jazzie b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jazzie_b ) , musician , has an obe * [ lemn sissay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lemn_sissay ) , poet , has an mbe and is the chancellor of the university of manchester * [ lenny henry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenny_henry ) , actor and comedian , has a knighthood * [ trevor mcdonald ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trevor_mcdonald ) , broadcaster , has a knighthood * [ shami chakrabarti ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shami_chakrabarti ) , barrister , leading civil rights advocate , cbe and chancellor of the university of essex the list could go on with bme judges , nobel laureates , sports men and women , business people , academics , who have received national honours .

   the `` american dream '' we like and admire that . 
   has been twisted and corrupted oops , sorry . 
  but only by some as i see . 
  there is a broad swathe of views apparent in the us but the extremes seem to gather all the attention . 
    `` throw the baby out with the bath water . '', 
   interesting ... imagery . 
  i do n't really get what you mean ? 
  you wash the baby . 
  the dirt goes off the baby into the bath water . 
  you now have the baby in a bath of dirty water . 
  this is terrible , intolerable , unacceptable , the baby is now sullied by the filth that engulfs it . 
  the whole thing must go down the sewer , bathwater , baby and all for the sake of ideals . 
  an example . 
  in the uk we had a comprehensive railway system funded by private enterprise . 
  the market became saturated and uneconomic due to lack of regulation . 
  we nationalised the railways . 
  we took a big knife and pruned the railway network back , getting rid of loss making lines while still subsidising socially important parts of the network . 
  we privatised the railways in a way that introduced competition for access to customers , for access to the infrastructure and access to capital ( you ca n't have direct competition for customers because of the natural monopoly aspects of rail ) . 
  we then nationalised the tracks and stations again because that was n't working as a private business . 
  the point of this example is that we have n't become constantly bound by political orthodoxy . 
  we compromise and adapt trying to take a rational and objective perspective . 
  at least this is the ideal some of us aspire to . 
  gut feelings and narrow mindedness has screwed us too ( c.f. 
  [ brexit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_european_union ) ) . 
  the intense distrust that some sectors of american society have with organised society in the form of government . 
  europe has strong sense of the value of the collective good when we all put a bit of money into a big pot and something good is done with it that might not benefit an individual now but will be there we or our family or our neighbour needs it . 
  this why we are happy to pay for healthcare systems , national broadcasters with remits to educate and inform , regulatory bodies for industry that keep people safe and the markets fair , and schools that aim to give a good education . 
  for americans it seems that the fear of government incompetence or corruption , the lack of a substitute for the profit motive , the absence of competitive markets are all so terrible they wo n't countenance such arrangements ( unless it is a military , police or rescue service for some reason . ), 
  i do n't think it helps that so many government officials are elected and so dependent upon campaign finance . 
  fund-raising takes between 25 % to 50 % of a congressman 's time . 
  we too in europe have all those fears but we know not to `` throw the baby out with the bath water . '', 
  in the uk we have constant debates and reviews about how we run our government , quasi-government and national institutions . 
  we deal with this by shaping our organisations and industries so there are competent checks and balances . 
  we have the bbc but we also have a thriving commercial media . 
  we have the nhs and we also have the national institute for health and care excellence which takes an evidence based approach to the effectiveness of health spending . 
  we have nationalised the railway lines but we privatise the trains that run on them . 
  we had privatised the railways lines but that did n't work so we took them back . 
  the list of examples of how we make compromises between free markets and government management goes on and on . 
  the important principle is that we are prepared to compromise and adapt to see what works best for the most people in an objectively just and fair way . 
  we do n't get hung up on rules and principles if they have passed their ` best by ' date . 
   i ca n't see any european country hosting a theme park based on christian fundamentalism , have n't you heard of the vatican city ? 
  why do we need a theme park when we have the beautiful and astonishing real thing ? 
  also have you not been to the parts of europe ( e.g. 
  bretagne ) where there is crucifix at nearly every road junction . 
   america is truly the world 's only surrealist culture . 
  what i see is a shameless self-parody . 
  it is as of they 've taken the whole `` too much geography and not enough history jibe '' and said `` yeah , i can go with that !, 
  now pass me my authentic hollywood style cowboy hat . '', 
  you wo n't get the las vegas strip in europe because we already have the champs elysees , las ramblas , and reeperbahn . 
  no need to construct something out of nothing .

  i do n't believe the comedy sketch in that video is accurate . 
  a lot of those rights were already present in british law or would have been added anyway . 
  we already had those rights or would have got them sooner or later anyway . 
  many people in britain are proud of the fact that our country significantly contributed to making the echr . 
   british mp and lawyer sir david maxwell-fyfe , the chair of the assembly 's committee on legal and administrative questions , was one of its leading members and guided the drafting of the convention ...  the convention was designed to incorporate a traditional civil liberties approach to securing `` effective political democracy '' , from the strongest traditions in the united kingdom , france and other member states of the fledgling council of europe , [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_convention_on_human_rights ) what the european convention on human rights means to me is that as we work together as europeans we know we are sharing a set of common basic values . 
  it ties us together and mediates our relations in a similar way the usa 's bill of rights gives an identity to us citizens . 
  similarly the consumer regulations pretty much just harmonise the consumer rights each nation would have , so the benefit is for individuals who want to buy goods or services from other parts of the eu as they know they will have the same protections as buying locally . 
  if britain wanted to truly declare independence we would have to leave the commonwealth , nato , western european union , osce , oecd , and the imf to name a few . 
  and while we are about it we should fire off a salvo of our independent nuclear weapons just to underscore our absolute independence . 
  but no , many of us are smart enough to recognise that in today 's highly connected world we have to manage our interdependence , through agreements , treaties , protocols and alliances . 
  whilst we are in the eu we can make these agreements more easily and effectively with our european neighbours , and as a european negotiating block we have more power making agreements with the rest of the world . 
  i fear that both trump and putin are happy to see europe divided and weaker so that they can pick us off , one by one . 
  you talk of our loss of control , but the eu has reduced the number of controls through harmonisation of regulations , freedom of movement for citizens and , where it applies , having a common currency . 
  [ look at this diagram of eu power structures ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/political_system_of_the_european_union.svg/2000px-political_system_of_the_european_union.svg.png ) and see how at the top are the national governments and parliaments . 
  we share control of the eu . 
  it 's like a bunch of friends sharing a car for a road-trip , we do n't all get exactly what we want , but we do get the road-trip .
