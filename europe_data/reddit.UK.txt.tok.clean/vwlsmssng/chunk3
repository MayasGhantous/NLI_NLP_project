  you talk about sovereignty as something that can only be given up . 
  by working with our european partners we have helped shaped europe and deal with our neighbours in a beneficial way that unifies us rather than divides us . 
  when we have poor countries at our periphery the eu has invested and supported them to develop their economies ( ireland & portugal , i 'm looking at you now ) so that people do n't need to migrate to get work . 
  it 's a better idea than just building a wall ( sorry scotland , please do n't do it to us this time ) . 
  our sovereignty is strengthened by our involvement with the eu , because we are all strengthened . 
  by acting as a coordinated block we have been able to develop competitive technologies and industries . 
  your mobile phone , like most of them in the world , is probably based on the european gsm standard or its successors , your phone or tablet almost certainly uses the british designed arm processor ( arm have about 200 non-uk eu citizens working in cambridge uk ) , your next flight could be on an airbus industrie plane , the most successful fusion energy machine is jet in the uk to be superseded by iter in france , the european space agency are a major player in the iss . 
  you said  the eu feels like an end point that a lot of my countrymen are extremely wary of in the uk the us feels like an end point that a lot of my countrymen are extremely wary of . 
  our prickly relationship with some of europe is partly because we 've resisted making the eu more like the the usa . 
   some other nation with citizens and leaders and a culture different then my own dictating a course of action we must take or we will be punished . 
  what on earth are you talking about ? 
  this has no semblance to reality ? 
  we voted to join the eu , our parliament makes our laws align with our neighbours , we have often led on the making of european law ( e.g. 
  ehcr ) , where there has been strong disagreement we have vetoed the laws or negotiated an opt-out . 
  our alliance with the eu has strengthened our economy , enhanced our security ( food , industrial base ) , broadened our minds . 
  if we become isolationist we will be less able to defend ourselves against damaging trade deals that will undermine our sovereignty . 
  we have many differences with our eu partners but we have much more in common . 
  finally , please remember that the eu is a development of the alliances forged after ww2 to sufficiently entwine the economies and interest of the european states so that another european war would be impossible . 
  finally , you mention trump , as if he is the anti-thesis of the political elite . 
  if you elect him he will be the new political elite , making deals and alliances with the rest of the political elite , who will actually know how to be politicians and leaders .

   why the euro is not dropping as dramatically as the pounds ? 
  perhaps because the rest of europe will continue to benefit from the economies and leverage of scale with businesses like airbus industrie , big science projects like iter and the vitality of markets where people can follow the work rather than stare wistfully over borders at undermanned factories or unworked fields . 
  meanwhile in the uk , big science projects such as jet will face political pressure to reduce their funding , verizon and finance businesses threaten to move jobs to the continent , and contracts could be cancelled or postponed because it 's just not worth the hassle of dealing with the uk . 
  i have not heard any justification as to why the uk should be able to make any better trade deals with non eu countries than the eu can . 
  i have not heard any explanation about how the uk will be able to make a better deal with the eu now than we could before simply because we had a well run opinion poll . 
  why would the eu give the uk as good a trade deal if we do n't pay in the same money or offer benefits in kind such as free movement of workers . 
  it used to be the case that hub gears were the main stay of utility bikes with the british [ sturmey archer ] ( http://www.sturmey-archerheritage.com/ ) being widely used in the uk and appreciated for their reliability and being good enough for the job . 
  nowadays hub gears are much rarer with uk customers mostly choosing bikes that either look like mountan-bikes or look like racing-bikes , making inexpensive shimano derailleurs ubiquitous . 
  practical city bikes that have mudguards , lights and a sit-up-and-beg riding position are becoming more popular amongst affluent commuters as the practicality of these `` dutch roadsters '' is appreciated more widely . 
  just as popular amongst the better off is the [ brompton folding cycle range ] ( https://www.brompton.com/ ) , partly because they can be folded small enough to be carried onto public transport as normal luggage . 
  derailleur bikes , while having an efficiency advantage when well maintained , are usually corroded and misaligned in the hands of most punters thus eliminating any advantage . 
  the hub gear is having a niche renaissance with the [ shimano alfine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shimano_alfine ) 8 & 11 speed models , and the astonishingly good [ rohloff speedhub ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rohloff_speedhub ) - 14 equally spaced sequential non-overlapping gear ratios operated by a single twistgrip giving an overall gear range of 526 % . 
  the rohloff is particularly popular amongst tandem cyclists , still a minority though due to the expense of the hub ( around # 800 ) .

  my recollection is of the `` hole in the wall '' expression being used from the outset for comic effect so it does n't surprise me that the `` barclays '' prefix is part of the tm , and the relatively recent filing date . 
  i hope you find this interesting , if only mildly so . 
  i 've not heard that usage myself . 
  take-out restaurants are just `` take-aways '' , local small general food stores are known as `` corner-shops '' irrespective of their position on the street . 
   i though cashpoint was always the lloyds trademark and hole in the wall was always the barclays trademark . 
  i did not know that , but a bit of googling supports that .

  you are going to have to search hard to find any wilderness in europe . 
  we do have some and you can camp wild if you 're considerate and discreet but i do n't think this is what you are up to if you are doing a city tour .

  we do n't really have [ judicial review in england ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judicial_review_in_english_law ) . 
  this includes wales . 
  we do get cases that sometimes find the government has exceeded the powers that parliament gave them but these are usually so niche and technical then they may get a headline for a day before being forgotten . 
  what still get remembered are any major miscarriages of justice that have subsequently been addressed by the courts . 
  notably the case of the [ birmingham six ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/birmingham_six ) and the [ guildford four ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guildford_four_and_maguire_seven#guildford_four ) , the latter whom had there story told in the movie [ in the name of the father ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/in_the_name_of_the_father_ ( film \\ ) ) .

  i 'm not sure if what you 've described is a true dichotomy . 
  i would say that in the uk we are prepared to put up with many government constraints to give us what we consider to be an objectively better country to live in . 
  for example we have a huge amount of cctv and anpr surveillance and are fairly confident one of our spy agencies ( gchq ) can snoop our communications pretty much at will . 
  in contrast we have a police force that is not routinely armed but when an officer was murdered it was a [ cctv / anpr systems that tracked the murderers ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bradford/4455918.stm ) who were subsequently arrested and prosecuted . 
  this could be seen as a negative freedom from criminal conspiracies . 
  if you own a tv receiver in the uk you are obliged to pay an annual fee . 
  at the same time we believe we have one of , if not the best quality and value for money tv services in the world with the bbc . 
  a negative freedom from rupert murdoch and his kin . 
  thirdly if you want healthcare you pretty much have to take what the national health service offers as you ca n't opt-out of paying for it by your taxes . 
  we have a continual national debate about how our nhs should be run but the basic principles are no longer a differentiator between the main political parties . 
  even notoriously small government favouring margaret thatcher promised the electorate that the nhs was safer under the tories than the labour party ( left wing . ), 
  a negative freedom from crippling health costs , especially in later life . 
  i think the rest of europe feel like cousins more than siblings because of the separation caused by the sea . 
  the exception to this rule are the irish because of the common language and longer history of population movement in both directions .

  yes , we want and highly value freedom of speech but if you 're going to be a dick about it we know where to draw the line . 
  we understand that freedom of speech serves a higher purpose and it becomes an abuse of that freedom when it harms the health of our society . 
  we will have and continue to have an open and free debate about this , but we wo n't let someone spoil things for everyone because by coming at us like an annoying child brandishing a copy of the full rules of monopoly and telling us the rules let him do what he wants even though he leaves all the other players upset and crying . 
  i do n't understand how trump can be seen as a great leader when he also says his policy proposals are just suggestions . 
  then there 's way he throws out insults to only deny them like a caught child : about megyn kelly  when pressed about why he re-tweeted `` bimbo '' jibes about her , he said : `` did i say that ?
