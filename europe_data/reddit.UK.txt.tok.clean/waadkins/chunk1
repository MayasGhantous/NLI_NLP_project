great painting . 
  love the french . 
  we do things right . 
  it just seemed appropriate . 
  but i do n't personally support ukip . 
  i love europe ; it 's just i think the eu has a bit too much power . 
  europe will never work like the united states . 
  just as our economy is at it 's strongest in years , the eu practically fine us . 
  bang out of order . 
  i really loved it there . 
  i can pin-point my exact walk through the city from this picture !, 
  great shot too !, 
  aww , but i love france !, 
  do n't be like that !, 
  there are people out there who genuinely believe the royal family are lizards in human-disguise . 
  i drive the classic !, 
  15 years old and still has n't let me down . 
  best first car i 've ever bought . 
  annoyingly , it was built in 1998 - after rover sold the rights to bmw , so it 's technically still a german built classic mini ... ahah . 
  at least it 's reliable . 
  oh yes , i know that !, 
  i was saying that we have no brands that provide hatchbacks/cheaper ranged vehicles etc. 
  until it was pointed out that we have mini ... 
  oh shit ... no word of a lie , i drive a mini cooper . 
  i think i need to go and hang myself . 
  i never even thought of that . 
  the brands on this post are those who sell hatchbacks , suvs etc. 
  britain does n't really have a company for that . 
  * yes * , we build for a lot of these companies , but home-grown british car companies are only for the elite i would think . 
  never occurred to me before . 
   no she 's a powerless figurehead and a drain on your society . 
  good grief . 
  that is such an ignorant answer . 
  the queen works harder than you and i will ever will . 
  for some reason - only people in the british commonwealth seem to understand that . 
  you 'll never understand , ( i presume you 're american ) being a republic and all . 
  i do n't have the time to say - but in short : since a teenager , she helped out as a jeep driver during ww2 . 
  after a ~ 7 year gap ( of , admittedly , very little ) , she was finally had her coronation in the early 50s . 
  ever since , * she has ruled the empire , wise enough to grant independence , to all those who are able to cope on their own , in the commonwealth , * signed and assented every uk law in britain since her coronation ( including removal of death penalty , banning of guns , and the most recent same-sex marriage legalisation ) , * she has had to keep relations with ** close to every single foreign ambassador in the world ** , excluding the hostile ones . 
  i could go on , but it 'll actually be about 5 reddit-pages . 
  take from that what you like - nvm if you still have your own views - but the queen still works a more-than-full day and she 's coming up to 90 years of age . 
  i hate it when i see these ignorant sorts of replies like ` the queen does fuck all ' , ` she does n't deserve her position ' , ` who needs a monarchy in the modern times ' . 
  she 's fully aware of her lucky position - do n't expect her to abdicate while she 's living , she will reign until her last breath . 
  and ( i can tell i do n't speak for you ) , america * oddly * is the biggest fan of the royal family after britain . 
  just saying . 
   i did n't say you did , just major media outlets and countless countrymen of yours . 
  i did n't see that coming out of any other country . 
  iran held a candle light ceremony to mourn , you had the guardian and bbc telling us how we deserved it . 
  &  no many just think we deserve to be violently murdered . 
  sources ? 
  because they are some bang-out-of-order accusations . 
   funny how that works for you but not anyone else . 
  i did n't actually understand what you just said there . 
   if you do n't want to live up to your treaty obligations do n't be a member , it 's quite simple . 
  especially when you have nothing but contempt for those in it . 
  could you fill me in on those obligations ? 
  i have n't kept up with it all , but i 'll probably know why we have n't met these requirements . 
  firstly , let 's not call them ` leaders ' here in / r/europe . 
  this is n't america - where in every sentence there always ** has to be some sort of reference to the military ** . 
  the ** queen ** is a leader ( and she does n't make critical decisions - she makes the law of the land ) - everybody else is an ` elected member of parliament ' ( or `` mp , '' for short ) , thanks . 
  i personally do n't agree with any country * deserving * an attack , and until you produce a source on that accusation i wo n't actually believe you ( having said that , america has pissed off a lot of nations , would n't you agree though ? ) . 
  * yes * , some people here do n't like americans - but not in a hostile way !, 
  we just hate your accent , guns ( which , fyi , ** is a problem ** ) , food that 's made of chemicals , and , of course , donald trump . 
  and having said that , i , and a lot of people i know , love the states - ** but only in a foreigner 's kind of love ** . 
  we do n't love the states in the sort of `` yeah , yankees hotdawgs 'n' gunz woooooop can of whoop-ass ` muricah , '' sort of way which is a heavy stereotype of the kinds of people in the states here . 
   you 're leaders made that choice . 
  tony blair made that choice . 
  there was no referendum , or * choice * from the british public . 
   the you should leave nato . 
  how can britain , a country in the ** north atlantic ** move out of the ** north atlantic treaty organi 's ` ation ** ? 
  yes , we 're an island - but we have n't worked out how to drift apart from europe . 
  we 've been trying that for centuries . 
   oh christ i 'm not religious - but you should say the lord 's name in vain . 
  are you american ? 
  because i find the images of 7/7 more shocking than that of 9/11 , simply because i 'm so familiar with the areas and infrastructure . 
  seeing a double-decker with the roof blown up , for me , is a more harrowing , and * realer * , than a hijacked plane . 
  and if you 're not american , i guess it just differs from person-to-person . 
  there were roughly the same amount of british casualties in both events . 
  i 'm not disrespecting 9/11 - i just feel it gets more attention here in britain than a terrorist attack that actually happened in our country . 
  [ every country reacts to terrorism . 
  it 's standard practice ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/reactions_to_the_2005_london_bombings ) . 
  those links show words that are no different than comments made by the philippines . 
  if america did that every year - then i 'll be impressed . 
  in fairness however , my problem is n't with america commemorating an attack in britain - it literally has nothing to do with you . 
  my problem is is that there has not been a sense of commemoration for 7/7 here , in britain , over the years . 
  you are actually the funniest person i 've ever had the pleasure in talking to . 
  could n't give a shit whether america commemorates 7/7 - it has nothing to do with them . 
  british schools are open in july . 
  so , by * silence * you meant * did n't actually turn up to the classroom * ? 
  ca n't even tell if he 's trolling . 
  his account is as old as his original comment ... 
  racism is discrimination on race . 
  as you noted , muslims are on every continent - and i do n't think i offended anybody , with relation to their biological construct , in my first post . 
  ignorance is a perfectly valid reason !, 
  are we suppose to teach every single religion in the world in our schools ? 
  secularisation is happening all across europe - fact . 
  religion , of any sort , should not be shoved down the throats of children as it is all evaporating into the realities of the modern world . 
  i will never respect a method of eating that involves the torturing of animals . 
  sorry if at all i seem detrimental - but i have yet to see any truth in religion . 
  as a student of sociology , i 've found an interesting quote :  ** conflict theory ** : religion reinforces and promotes social inequality and social conflict .
