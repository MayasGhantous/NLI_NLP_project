they 're being smuggled into spain, 
   the ukraine a scoop like this and you ca n't even get the country 's name right ? 
  smells fishy, 
   my point is it 's only growing when you look one year behind , and not by a lot , and historically it have been going up and down by that amount for more years . 
  so there are probably not much change . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_first_en.pdf look at the graph on page 19 . 
  in 2013 there was just a 9 % gap between for and against , now that is 19 % . 
  this year there has been two consecutive increases in support for the first time since 2007 , and the largest increase of the support index ( for-against ) since 2002 !, 
  support is clearly ** growing ** , and has absolutely been ** changing ** since 2008 . 
  an alternative title would be `` support for euro near pre-crisis levels '', 
  so in other words ... support for the euro is growing, 
   same sex `` marriage '' lol, 
  how do the french speaking and walloon governments differ ? 
  edit : i know brussels is mainly french speaking but how are the powers divided between french and brussels/walloon governments ? 
  soon slovakia will overtake czechia in gdp per person . 
  what a turn around . 
  i 'm not a big fan of it , but i found this article quite interesting . 
  how are coalition negotiations going ? 
  ukip will be left with no-one . 
  he ran a campaign about europeans stealing british jobs . 
  that 's 100k views in a day, 
  in no expert but i think not having a group means a lot less funding . 
  funding which ukip relies on . 
  looks like despite national success ukip will be the big loser in the european parliament , unable to form a group and with no acceptable group to join . 
  hopefully it will get some publicity each time a country hits its target . 
  can they put them up in the uk too ? 
  there is something dangerous lurking in the shallow waters of the baltic sea . 
  nearly 70 years after the victorious allies dumped thousands of tonnes of nazi chemical weapons and chemical agents into the baltic sea , experts have warned of an environmental disaster as the weapons corrode and their deadly contents spill into sea . 
  under an agreement reached at the potsdam conference in 1945 , britain and the soviet union dumped around 65,000 tonnes of germany 's chemical weapons stockpile into the murky depths of the baltic sea in 1947-48 . 
  since then the threat posed by the shells and drums full of hazardous waste has been subject to speculation and research . 
  some scientist called it a `` ticking time-bomb '' . 
  it now appears the ticking has got louder . 
  recent research by poland 's military university of technology has found traces of mustard gas on the sea bed just a few hundred metres off the polish coast , in the gulf of gdansk . 
  this indicates corrosion of the metal , and that poisonous chemicals are now leaking into the water and could be absorbed by fish , entering the food chain . 
  scientists are concerned , but not just because containers are leaking . 
  there should be no chemical weapons in the gulf of gdansk as this was not a dumping zone . 
  stanislaw popiel , from the team of the military university , which carried out the research , said that it was hard to say where the contamination came from . 
  one possible explanation is that the soviets had a fairly care-free attitude to where they dumped the weapons . 
  although the vast majority of the munitions were thrown into the bornholm and gotland deeps , jacek beldowski , from the polish institute of oceanography , said the soviets often threw everything overboard `` as soon as they were out of sight of land '' . 
  this means there could be tonnes of chemical weapons lying in unknown locations , close to land and in fishing zones . 
  mr beldowski has also found an increase in fish with illnesses and genetic defects in the areas of the known dumping zones ; evidence that some of the containers are indeed leaking . 
  while this is worrying , some scientists argue that most of the containers will in all likelihood remain sealed for decades to come , and that the environmental conditions at the bottom of the baltic sea should contain any hazards . 
  the cold temperatures turn mustard gas into a thick solid state , making it difficult for any contamination to spread . 
  but the fact that contamination is spreading and affecting the environment , and that nobody really knows where all the chemical weapons are , is a serious cause for concern . 
  in mr popiel 's worst-case scenario the baltic area could be hit by an `` environmental disaster greater than chernobyl '' within a few years . 
  these dangers have spurred the baltic states into examining the possibility of removing some of the weapons from the sea bed . 
  poland 's environmental protection agency has suggested enlisting the help of nato because it has the funds and the technology needed to lift the toxic waste . 
  but even if the alliance agreed to help , any salvage operation would be fraught with danger . 
  experts warn that attempts to raise the fragile rusting shells and drums could actually break them up and trigger a massive release of deadly chemicals . 
   but here 's the extraordinary thing . 
  the eu , according to a german entrepreneur i was speaking to , wants it banned . 
  or , to be more specific , various french corporatist interests are apparently seeking to have gallium arsenide banned throughout the eu because the new technology is a threat to their interests . 
  so why lie and say that ** the eu ** wants it banned ? 
  in case of a pay wall : when a new french law banned employers from checking work emails after 6pm , it was bound to grab headlines . 
  it fit all too neatly the image held by les anglo-saxons of france as a work-shy nation of long lunches and short working weeks . 
  and all too neat it was . 
  in fact , no such law existed . 
  but by the time anybody noticed , the damage had been done , prompting axelle lemaire , the new french minister for the digital economy , to tweet a denial ( in english ) on april 13th . 
  news of the french ban ricocheted through the english-speaking media at the end of last week . 
  `` no after-work e-mails please . 
  french ordered to ignore the boss after 6pm '' ran the title of one report . 
  plenty followed suit , for example , here , here and here . 
  reports suggested that a new law covering about 1m employees forbade them from consulting emails before 9am and after 6pm . 
  `` c\u2019est all right for some , quoi ? '' quipped lucy mangan in the guardian , in a blog post that has since been corrected . 
  and yes , oops , we were a bit overenthusiastic ourselves in one of the economist 's london-based blogs . 
  in fact , there was no new piece of french legislation , but a labour agreement signed on april 1st by unions and employers in the high-tech and consulting field . 
  it covers an estimated 250,000 `` autonomous employees '' , whose contracts are based on days worked , not hours , and so the 35-hour working week limit does not apply . 
  the agreement does refer to an `` obligation to disconnect communications tools '' , but only after an employee has worked a 13-hour day . 
  such workers may work into the weekends too , but must be allowed to have one day off in every seven ( 24 hours + 11 hours ) . 
  nowhere does the agreement refer to a 6pm cut-off . 
  by the standards of most french labour contracts , which have to apply the 35-hour working week , it is unusually liberal , and was designed to help global companies that deal across different time zones . 
  needless to say , the french media unpicked the foreign reports with a mix of bafflement and indignation , leading to much grumbling on twitter and finally to ms lemaire 's corrective tweet . 
  the whole business was all the more awkward given that president fran\u00e7ois hollande has been edging towards a more business-friendly economic policy under his new prime minister , manuel valls . 
  yet , with a 35-hour working week , entrenched union rights within companies , and a strict 3,500-page labour code , the reality remains that the country does not make it easy for firms to operate . 
  the real trouble for france is that the story ever appeared plausible . 
  did you make a mistake with the percentages ? 
  the last election was the only election since the war without your stated outcome .

  how exactly did germany `` obsessively try to amass surpluses '' ? 
  could you name the specific policies you believe were put in place to achieve this ? 
   first of all , it 's not strictly true . 
  the euro 's popularity has fallen sharply among crisis-hit countries . 
  but even so , it tells me that either they 're idiots and do n't see the connection or that they 're afraid of the repercussions that an exit from the monetary union would entail . 
  you know best . 
   the euro was a catalyst for german surpluses that had to be invested somewhere , anywhere . 
  it was a catalyst for greece having extremely low interest rates i do n't see how these are bad things . 
  investment is good , and if used correctly low interest rates are also good . 
  it was up to the greek government to spend wisely but they did n't , and that was their failure , not the euro 's . 
   i guess people will only start to acknowledge the systemic roots of the crisis when their country collapses too . 
  & yet the crisis hit country 's populations all want to keep the euro . 
  what does that tell you ? 
  it does not guarantee the right to enter any country one would like though .
