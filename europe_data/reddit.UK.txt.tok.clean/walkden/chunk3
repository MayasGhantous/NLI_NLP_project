  if the eu can not strike deals with the growing economies of the world then really what good is it ... 
  putting up barriers is very different to taking them down . 
  eu has now failed to negotiate with india , australia , usa & canada ( i.e. 
  economies with growth rather than stagnation ) . 
  trudeau was right : the eu risks becoming irrelevant . 
  sadly we are leaving i think they meant . 
  it is the opinion of many , many respected economists that monetary union requires fiscal union . 
  stop the west, 
   yeah , i am sure it was a `` savage racist attack '' and not a normal night fight . 
  erm ...  she suffered `` claw-shaped '' scratches to her back , fractured toes and had lost some of her hair . 
   ...  describing the aftermath of the assault , he said : `` when the two girls left they were laughing and shouting ` poland rule the world ' . 
  if it was the other way round ... 
  all of which are against independence in this case . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  daytime tv vs the news, 
  if the brexit vote did n't i do n't see why this would . 
  and commentators learned no lessons . 
  luckily we do n't have to convert to dollars when we spend the extra pounds gained on investments . 
   a dutch company did get 23 % of the fishing quota in uk waters i believe that was actually a single dutch ship that had 23 % of the uk fishing quota ( although perhaps it is the same , and no other dutch ships have a uk fishing quota ) . 
  it 's just below the eu average http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/corporate-tax-rates-become-issue-brexit-talks/, 
  lib dems are irrelevant . 
  gbp is turning plastic !, 
  the new polymer # 5 note was released into circulation this week and the # 10 and # 20 will follow by 2020 . 
  this referendum was not at all rejection of europe or european people . 
  it was only a rejection of the political project . 
  please show me some examples of brexiteers using the excuse that `` brexit has n't happened yet '' . 
  in my experience that is exclusively used by pro-eu types about good news from the uk . 
  further : 18 % said that scottish independence would make them more likely to vote to remain in the uk , while 15 % said this would make them more likely to vote for a united ireland . 
  one wonders why they do n't create one themselves . 
  with a single currency to boot . 
  one wonders how any country survives outside of the eu ... 
  immortal words . 
   as things stand right now , the uk will also pay a contribution in the future , even in the case of a brexit . 
  i totally agree with you , except if this article comes to fruition and brits have to pay to enter the eu . 
  done . 
  # 350 million is the membership fee , # 270 million with the rebate and # 160 million with investments and uk spending subtracted . 
  that makes it ~ # 160million per week so this yearly figure will cover about a months worth of uk fees . 
   according to euractiv 's calculations , etias could easily bring in $ 500 million per year by 2020 . 
  $ 500 million per year ... the uk pays # 240 million per week . 
  i suppose it 's a start . 
  imo it 's a bit late for that ... no control of currency = no control over economic policy ( see greece ) = no democracy . 
  predictions were made after the vote https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/economics/5099-uk-forecast-to-fall-into-recession, 
   credit suisse increased its forecast for 2016 growth from 1 per cent to 1.9 per cent and its 2017 forecast from a contraction of 1 per cent to growth of 0.5 per cent . 
  that means credit suisse are now predicting higher 2016 growth than they did pre-referendum !, 
  https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/economics/5099-uk-forecast-to-fall-into-recession  credit suisse have cut gdp forecast for this year to 1.0 % from 1.8 % and our 2017 forecast to -1.0 % from 2.3 % . 
   the surveys that informed the rankings were carried out before the uk voted in june to leave the eu . 
  working on it with india ? 
  those talks have been mothballed since 2013 http://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/india-eu-fail-to-make-headway-on-free-trade-agreement-talks/articleshow/51633059.cms, 
  this would n't be implemented retrospectively . 
  2 years, 
  why not ? 
  if those in calais now are allowed into the uk today then next week the camp will be twice the size . 
  if other states want to curb free movement then they should have spoken up during cameron 's renegotiation, 
  no freedom of movement, 
  continental partnership would not have freedom of movement . 
  ask nicola sturgeon . 
  here is what she said today . 
   `` the uk that existed before june 23 has fundamentally changed . 
  the debate now is whether we should go forward , protecting our place as a european nation or go backwards , under a tory government with very different priorities . '', 
   `` and while we will pursue all options to protect our interests , the debate must include an examination of independence in what are profoundly changed circumstance '', 
  the may not have suppressed them but they have stopped them from rising . 
  but but https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/524967/hm_treasury_analysis_the_immediate_economic_impact_of_leaving_the_eu_web.pdf  a vote to leave would cause an immediate and profound economic shock creating instability and uncertainty which would be compounded by the complex and interdependent negotiations that would follow . 
   the central conclusion of the analysis is that the effect of this profound shock would be to push the uk into recession and lead to a sharp rise in unemployment . 
  the uk is a sovereign country with a foreign policy . 
  scotland is part of that country . 
  it was in the manifesto . 
  basically , no . 
  a few hundred inquiries ... 
  this would then cause twice as many to come to calais . 
  do n't bother . 
  `` brexit has n't happened yet '' is parroted out in every single thread relating to good news in the uk while at the same time any bad news is directly attributed to brexit . 
   the number of people on the claimant count in july , the first month since the uk 's vote to leave the eu , was 763,600 , down 8,600 from june . 
  thank you . 
  i wonder how cohesive these teams would be . 
  brexit has n't happened yet . 
  it reduces uncertainty . 
  in the future the government will be free to assess and change how this money is spent but for know this is the obvious course of action . 
  cameron said that to scare people into voting remain . 
  it was always obvious that it would not be triggered immediately . 
  what % of them turned out to vote in the last referendum ? 
  sturgeon 's red lines amount to eu membership , which , ironically , independence would actually break . 
  currency was bigger . 
  now there are new questions about a border and trade barriers with england ( where 60 % of their exports go ) . 
   with people moving from countries with high unemployment to those with a shortage of labour but this simply will not happen to the same degree as in the usa or in an optimal currency zone . 
  people can do this right now but still 50 % of greeks stay unemployed in greece rather than move to a different country . 
  the language and cultural barriers are too great . 
   a limited single market for manufactured goods and some services , i.e. 
  the continent sells what it 's good at unrestricted to the uk , but the uk faces barriers to selling what it excels at . 
  all other states were free to opt out of the euro and schengen . 
  it 's not our fault they did n't . 
  there 's 306k in spain and 1.2 mill in the total eu http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36046900, 
  unlikely . 
  from the article there are 27k erasmus students in the uk and 15k british erasmus students in the eu . 
  as expected . 
  in the run-up to the referendum no-one doubted the long term prospects of the uk economy , but it was exactly this period of uncertainty in which recession , mass movement away from the uk , a collapse in fdi etc was predicted . 
  that is quite a conspiracy you have there . 
  time will tell i suppose ... 
   what stops them from never being ready ? 
  reality ? 
  almost half of conservative mps backed brexit and and many others ( including mrs may herself ) are eurosceptic reluctant remainers .
