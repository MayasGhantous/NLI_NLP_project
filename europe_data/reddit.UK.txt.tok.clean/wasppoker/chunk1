any woman that willingly wears one of these oppressive medieval veils is brainwashed . 
  it has absolutely no place in europe . 
  get rid of it . 
   peaceful and democratic contries like venezuela . 
  this is news to me . 
  amazing how quickly warsaw was rebuilt , using the same street layouts and even replicating the original architecture in places . 
   when warsaw 's old town was destroyed by hitler 's troops in the second world war , the nation mobilised to rebuild the city with the rubble of its own destruction -- and the work of italian painter bernardo bellotto  bellotto 's paintings were especially prized because so many of the works documenting poland 's history had been blacklisted by the nazis . 
  ( their blacklist consisted of artworks they believed had to be destroyed in order to implement the `` germanisation '' of poland . ), 
   when warsaw was bombarded in september 1939 , the burlington magazine for connoisseurs wrote of its concern for the safety of bellotto 's paintings -- but in fact , all 22 street scenes survived the war . 
  since 1984 they have been exhibited in the royal castle 's canaletto room . 
   bellotto 's paintings , along with the expertise of polish architects , art historians and conservators , enabled the reconstruction of the old town to take place in an impressively short period of time . 
  most of the work was finished before 1955 -- although additional construction continued into the 1980s , and the city is arguably still feeling the impacts of the second world war even now . 
  i 'll refrain from pointing out the obvious . 
  oops , error in title .

  how else was the autobahn built ? 
  i thought it interfered with german work ethic , at least that 's what i was told . 
  i 've never heard of a german musician apart from beethoven ( who was deaf ) and krafwerk which is music for carrying out repetitive tasks . 
  do germans even listen to music ? 
  they ai n't seen nothing yet . 
  i wonder what percentage of hash seized in spain is moroccan ? 
  oh , back in your box , russia . 
  i wonder what percentage of those romanians are gypsies with romanian passports . 
  am i reading this right ? 
  over 60 % of the dutch prison population are foreign , 10 % are moroccan , 10 % are surinamese and 5 % are turkish , according the [ official stats ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fstatline.cbs.nl%2fstatweb%2fpublication%2f%3fdm%3dslnl%26pa%3d82321ned&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  that 's pretty shocking . 
   ~ ~ european countries ~ ~ ** merkel ** did n't just accept the refugees that showed up , but actively asked them to come . 
  this is lonleyplanet . 
  the spanish one has a page for the bedroom with stuff like `` fuck me harder '' . 
  where do you see th\u1ea1t ? 
  it looks like ceta has enough negatives for the public to not do it - let 's hope the countries see sense and it fails at the ratification stage . 
  typical white male . 
  good , more of this please . 
  i 'm offended by the burka . 
  it 's a symbol of religious oppression that has absolutely no place in europe . 
  cool seeing a bit of occitan . 
  i see the similarities with catalan . 
  the french state has not been kind to its regional languages . 
  big shame . 
  most people just do n't accept it happens or if it does then `` he probably deserved it '' . 
  i know two guys who have abused by their partners . 
  abuse has ranged from slaps and shoves to being kneed in the groin and attempts to stab them with a kitchen knife . 
  emotional abuse as you 'd imagine , constant criticism about how useless and worthless they are , mind games and possessions being destroyed . 
  neither spoke much about it , i think they felt utter shame . 
  both stayed for many years - they had children and also ( as is always so hard to understand ) they still felt love for their partners when they were being nice ( domestic abuse is usually followed by attempts to make it up in order to stop the partner leaving ) . 
  it 's a perfectly acceptable and common term used in the uk . 
  i bet you do n't see the south koreans being such whiny little crybabies . 
  let 's be honest , we 've all done at least two of the above . 
  [ a sea story ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/05/a-sea-story/302940/ ) - an outstanding article by william langewiesche on the disaster . 
  one of the most disturbing tragedies ever . 
  just thinking about it gives me chills . 
  from partying with friends to getting crushed by refrigerators and slot machines in 5 minutes . 
  and even if you did happen to miraculously make it to the ship deck , you then had to to survive 20-foot , lethally freezing waves . 
  yeah , but who invited them publicly en masse ? 
  russia 's continued denial that it was their missile , when it obviously was , and fired by them , is a farce . 
  they 've already lost all credibility for their repeated denial that they have have troops and equipment in ukraine , despite obvious evidence otherwise . 
  russia could have got its act together and become a rising , trustworthy nation since the end of the ussr and the beginning of the 21st century . 
  instead , we 're back to bizarro russia and it 's bloodthirsty quest to put eastern europe back under its thumb . 
   i blame them for everything . 
  yes , you can blame us for football , rugby , tea , pubs , tv , language , common law , towns and cities , schools , universities , architecture , infrastructure , etc , etc. 
  awfully sorry , old chum . 
  * all this and more after the break . . *, 
  unemployment is only one of the many problems facing the next french president , and some of them are irreconcilable . 
  the french unions will not allow any government to privatise or modernise the economy . 
  the tax laws are antiquated and the authorities acknowledge that about 50 % of work is done `` travail au noir '' . 
  [ la\u00efcit\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la%c3%afcit%c3%a9 ) is under increasing threat from islamists who flatly refuse to accept that france is a secular state . 
  they will continue to push the boundaries and there will be no compromise on either side . 
  i do hope romania keeps up with their fight against corruption and continues their economic growth . 
  if they do , a more positive perception will likely follow . 
  i heard it 's all greek . 
   by end of year http://i.imgur.com/kwyvsnm.gif, 
   they should learn at the very least the greek language as soon as possible if we want them to integrate . 
  good luck with that . . 
  maybe they could position them between italy and libya . 
  that 'd be nice . 
   it 's always the immigrants that apparently are to blame . 
  everything i 've read and seen about the gang problems in malm\u00f6 firmly points to muslim immigrants and their offspring . 
  are you saying that 's not the case ? 
  http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-sweden-grenades-idukkcn0qe09f20150809  around a third of the city 's population are immigrants - double the national average , and nearly one in three is unemployed . 
  among young immigrants , the rate is nearly 40 percent - somalis , iraqis , bosnians and iranians squeezed into concrete tenement blocks . 
   gangs began here decades ago as motorcycle groups and were increasingly dominated by immigrants , thanks to an influx in the 1990s of refugees of balkan wars and then immigrants from the middle east , africa and eastern europe . 
   according to [ statistics provided by malmo authorities ] ( http://malmo.se/kommun--politik/statistik.html ) , 31 percent of the city 's 300 , 000 population were born abroad and nearly 41 percent of the residents have a foreign background . 
  the main countries from which immigration takes place are ones which have been recently plagued by conflicts -- migrant groups from iraq , syria , the former yugoslavia and somalia are among them . 
  the data also says that the muslim population constitutes about 20 percent of malmo 's population ; this is one of the most significant percentages in scandinavian cities . 
  any swedes know what malm\u00f6 was like before mass immigration , or has it always been a bit dodgy ? 
  and miniature flags for the celibate . 
  the depressing thing is , even if all immigration into europe was halted today , we 're still looking at a massive shift in demographic balance over the next two decades . 
  the terrorist attacks , sexual assaults , hate crimes and general civil unrest we 've seen in the past two years are just a tiny taster of what 's in store for europe . 
  the only way this is headed is a civil war as eu politicians continue to ignore the issues and civilians take matters into their own hands . 
  think it ca n't happen ? 
  just watch . 
  nothing new there then . 
  oh , good god . 
  and what 's slovenia famous for ? 
  nobody knows . 
  oh dear , looks like you 've taken a lighthearted post a little too seriously . 
  i would strongly advise it , canada . 
  - europe,
