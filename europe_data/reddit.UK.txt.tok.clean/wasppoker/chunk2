  well , it 's the same with a lot of these tyrants - they 're a necessary evil . 
  saddam was removed and now look at the fucking chaos in the region . 
  why on earth not ? 
  everyone has a price and , by god , europe seems to be finding endless supplies of cash for the millions of illegal migrants already here . 
  i laughed but it 's the sad truth . 
  gaddafi kept stability in the region and we took that away . 
  he warned us that migrants and terrorist attacks would flood europe if we removed him , [ and he was right ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/12086505/tony-blairs-phone-conversations-with-colonel-gaddafi-revealed.html ) . 
  well done , orban . 
  telling it like it is . 
  one of the few politicians in europe that is n't afraid to upset the pc brigade and social justice morons . 
  this is what many people have been suggesting for years but always get labelled a nazi by the bleeding heart progressives . 
  if illegal migrants knew they would be deported to libya for entering the eu illegally , you can guarantee the majority would rather stay in their own , perfectly fine , non-war-torn countries and the illegal migration stream would eventually trickle to manageable levels . 
  and you 'd be surprised how many illegal migrants would suddenly `` find '' their passports if given the choice of repatriation or deportation to a libyan camp . 
  has anyone got a better solution ? 
  barely passes for native english . 
   it 's fermented fish oh , my mistake !, 
  truly a culinary marvel . 
  ah , you 're from sweden , where tinned rotting fish carcass passes for cuisine . 
  and danish cuisine is so famous . 
  we eat winter food all year round . 
   many will not pass the winter . 
  it 's france , not siberia .

  at the very least central london should go car free every sunday . 
  i 'd prefer to see all cars removed from inside the n and s circulars at all times . 
  you know what else is up in germany over the past few years ? 
  2x hate crimes seems like quite a small increase in comparison .

  czechia in english . 
  charming gent . 
  we should have him stuffed . 
   your solution definitely wo n't work why ? 
  it 's working for australia . 
  the hilarious thing about people like you is that you * never * have any other solution . 
  just continue to let millions and millions of young , angry muslim men flood into europe ? 
  and i would n't be taking any immigration advice from an american . 
  come visit the muslim banlieues of paris and brussels or the sharia patrolled areas of london , and you will quickly change your naive little mind . 
  next headline : `` deported vagrant grounds flight to france for groping flight attendant '', 
  i was n't suggesting british people actually move there to live but just to make use of the eu passports . 
  companies could move some parts of their business there to avail of the tax haven , eu market and cheap labour . 
  it 's pretty much uk but it will still be in the eu . 
  you know , i did n't vote for brexit , but we might as well make use of what 's available . 
  i tried sending you 20 european euro monies but it 's asking for your bank account details . 
  can you pm me your name , address and pin number asap . 
  thanks mate . 
  as the article says , it 's 100 % culturally british , a tax haven , and just a few miles off the mainland . 
  what more could you want ? 
  also , many uk citizens naturally have a right to an eire passport , which is technically an eu passport and gives you all the freedom of movement you need . 
  for once the little irish republic is of some use to us . 
  we shall rename it `` european england '' . 
  it actually says `` a survey of 200 senior business leaders in the financial services , asset management and professional services sectors . . '', 
  that 's why i 'm offering solutions and you 're not . 
  if illegal migrants knew they would be deported to libya for entering the eu illegally , you can guarantee the majority would rather stay in their own , perfectly fine , non-war-torn countries and the illegal migration stream would eventually trickle to manageable levels . 
  and you 'd be surprised how many illegal migrants would suddenly `` find '' their passports if given the choice of repatriation or deportation to a libyan camp . 
  what 's your solution ? 
   to kick those who already are down http://i.imgur.com/a/ogyla.gifv, 
  pay libya to build a huge immigration camp and deport them all there . 
  they 'll soon make their way home to their * non-war-torn * countries when they realise the eu social welfare hotel is permanently closed to chancers . 
  does anyone have a better idea ? 
  [ here you go , you dirty license fee-paying bastard .

  who needs vaccinations ? 
  a few healing crystals will clear those measles right up . 
  as the saying goes , not all muslims are terrorists , but most terrorists are indeed muslim . 
  no , but we can drink rain . 
  britain shall be the eternal land of peace in that case . 
  i recall some years ago at language exchange bar in spain , a spaniard kept pestering me as to why i did n't drink alcohol `` where 's your pint of larger ?? '', 
  `` where 's your fucking sombrero , you cunt . '', 
  ca n't blame him really . 
  for years i thought portugal was in south america/brazil somewhere . 
  only recently i found out it 's actually in western spain . 
  have you got a source for that ? 
  northern germany is quite nice , denmark in particular . 
  you know what else threatens peace ? 
   australia 's practices of mandatory detention of asylum seekers , `` abuses '' related to offshore processing , and outsourcing of refugee obligations to other countries were heavily criticized by united nations experts , foreign governments , and even some australian government-funded inquiries . 
  exactly the system europe needs . 
  thankfully australia does n't pander to these bleeding heart `` critics '' , something europe is going to have to learn the hard way . 
  * what * human rights abuses ? 
  why not spend your energy criticising the * real * human rights violators like saudi arabia , north korea and the countless other shitholes in the world . 
  australia !? 
  give me a fucking break !, 
  oh yes , the horseshit `` human rights '' criticisms from loony progressive left . 
  denying illegal economic migrants entry to your country is not a `` human rights '' issue . 
  give me a break . 
   but considering the conditions this is not as bad as some people in here make it look . 
  i do n't think you could make it look any worse if you tried . 
  the figures are truly shocking , whichever way you present them . 
   in any case , the vote wo n't change the unwelcoming reception refugees already face when they arrive on hungary 's borders . 
  it 's called an international border . 
  if i travelled to the united states without a visa or passport , i would n't be given much of a `` welcoming reception '' at the border either . 
  unbelievable . 
  i feel sorry for the eu states stuck on the front line who are receiving no help nor leadership from the eu bigwigs , who are incidentally quick to criticise the likes of hungary for enforcing its own borders with fences . 
  time to get rid of schengen and let the eu states enforce their own borders ? 
  because that 's where we 're headed . 
  time to pay libya to build a massive immigrant camp and deport them there for processing . 
  really , what else can we do ? 
  europe is doomed if we do n't stop this madness today . 
  i was wondering why it was so quiet over there , then i realised they 're all over at / r/sheep, 
   i actually do n't like persianas , i find them very impractical .
