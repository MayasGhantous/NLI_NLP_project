  le pen will never win !, 
  frexit will never happen !, 
  * get your heads out of the sand . 
  no offence , mate , but these are * not * credible sources . 
   anecdotal exactly . 
  greece does n't have any money so they 've nothing to lose . 
  have you a source for any of this ? 
  you have deliberately misunderstood my comment and gone on an unnecessary tirade that i care not to read . 
  indians integrate well , it 's people from muslim countries who have a harder time integrating so your point is out the window . 
  when did the first computer arrive in portugal ? 
  anyone who 's been to spain will notice a lot of spanish women age very badly with face like tough leather . 
  it 's because of excessive smoking and sun exposure . 
  scotland is going nowhere because it simply is n't a viable state . 
  ( scottish debt , anyone ? ) . 
  just look at southern ireland which has never been economically viable since deserting the union ( except for the so-called and short-lived * celtic tiger * which turned out to be a sham in the end ) . 
  uk should stick together as one single economic and cultural unit . 
  nationalism by a tiny minority should never trump economical sense . 
  stop being dishonest . 
  we 're not talking about indians , are we ? 
  the vast majority of migrants are from muslim countries who are most likely not to integrate . 
  the netherlands should know all about that . 
  like using petrol to put out a fire . 
   if they integrate they wo n't . 
  portugal has the atlantic wind and iberian sun . 
  they could be europe 's renewable powerhouse . 
  when is kosovo going to join up with albania ? 
  surely enough time has passed . 
  it 's an odd thing to say . 
  castile does n't really need a community or `` nation '' because its culture and language now dominates most of spain . 
  that * is * their nation . 
  as long as talented and motivated young people in germany are allowed to freely leave the east for better opportunities in the west , regional differences in economic development will persist . 
  governments are all used to managing growth . 
  they must now learn how to manage population shrinkage . 
  we need a complete rethink in our societies . 
  greece should have left the eurozone years ago . 
  should never have been allowed to join in the first place considering their finances have always been a * complete sham * . 
  has it ? 
  it annexed crimea and the world did nothing . 
  eastern ukraine is next . 
  where does the congo fit into all of this ? 
  i see it 's conveniently missing from the map . 
  the constitution was carefully written so that no one could ever leave . 
  kinda like a castilian cult . 
  very few people have the appetite for ode to joe and eu flags when all they see around them is the deterioration of their own societies and culture due to the eu 's disastrous immigration policies and continued inaction . 
  close the borders , deport the illegals and start helping our own citizens instead . 
  until that happens , expect europeans to continue to vote for the right in desperation , which will lead to the eu 's eventual dissolution . 
  this subreddit said brexit would never happen . 
  now we have le pen and frexit actually becoming a reality . 
  you simply can not ignore it anymore nor pretend it has nothing to do with the mass importation of illegal economic chancers from cultures wholly incompatible with our own . 
  eastern ukraine will be annexed in time . 
  now that russia knows the only repercussions are a few stern words from world leaders , it will continue nibbling away at the rest of ukraine , maybe even test the waters in the baltics . 
  it 's no wonder sweden is in such a state when it 's own people blatantly lie about their immigration numbers . 
  ^ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_sweden ^ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_sweden  ** 1,473,256 foreign born ** within sweden in 2012 that does n't include the past four years because the swedish government now only report the amount of asylum applications ( i wonder why ) , but it 's safe to say there are upwards of ** 2 million foreign born ** immigrants in sweden today . 
  get your head out of the sand . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_sweden https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_sweden  ** 1,473,256 foreign born ** within sweden  immigration reached its highest level since records began with ** 115,845 people migrating to sweden in 2013 alone ** what about 2014 , 2015 , 2016 , another half a million maybe ? 
  it seems the swedish government now only reports the amount of asylum applications . 
  i wonder why !, 
  and just a few days ago [ another ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38930201 ) 16-year-old girl was caught with bomb-making material in france . 
  good god , what have we gotten ourselves into . 
  i wonder how bad it will have to get for swedes to realise that trying to integrate millions of immigrants might just not be possible after all . 
  i fear the kindness of their hearts will be the ultimate demise of their nation . 
  except that it 's an excepted geographic term used since ancient greece . 
  get over it . 
  that 's just 21st century fact , mate . 
  if cannabis is ever to be legalised outright , it needs to be an agreed policy that works for all our british isles . 
  as long as you continue to keep the borders open and do nothing to address the muslim ghettos , there 's plenty more terrorism in store for europe . 
  just another reason why they should never had been allowed join the eu , and certainly not the eurozone . 
  what a mess . 
  why ? 
  what a stupid statement . 
  you 're from south holland . 
  if it 's any consolation , i like people from north holland more . 
  see how ridiculous that sounds ? 
  only because you are anglophone monoglots , obviously there are going to be more of you on an english-language forum . 
  hardly an achievement . 
   schulz schulz wants * [ more ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5r2le0/martin_schulz_thanks_the_reddit_community_for/dd4887x/ ) * immigration into europe . 
  put him in power and he will do even more damage to europe than merkel did . 
  both their heads should be on a stake for driving europe to the right and destroying the union . 
  agreed !, 
  and orange of course . 
  lol . 
  `` it 's so warm today , my skin is melting ! '', 
  `` nothing to see here , stay in your homes . '', 
  `` but the sky is * green !, 
  well if you want to do that , go ahead , though i 'm sure some dutch infrastructure guru around here would know . 
  i 'm intrigued to know what they are . 
  what are they ? 
  https://www.google.com/maps/@52.3257933,5.0642074,569m/data=!3m1!1e3 so that 's why they built it . 
  and , are those * tulips * ? 
  in the same way poland should never be in a space contest - that 'd be just cruel . 
  how did they evacuate an entire city of witnesses without news getting out of ussr ? 
  or did they only evacuate after the swedes blew the whistle ? 
  i mean , residents of pripyat saw the sky glowing on the night of the accident ffs . 
  a break up of the eu is more likely than a break up of uk . 
  the first domino has fallen . 
  france next . 
  yes !, 
  now the rest of europe please . 
  i do n't want to see this oppressive nonsense here . 
  * triggered !,
