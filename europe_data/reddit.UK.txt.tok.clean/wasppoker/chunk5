  what ? 
  will france be the second domino after britain ? 
  the eu project is crumbling before us . 
   romania , not morocco as he said , france and spain have been touched by the biggest misfortune . 
  just what i was looking for to be honest . 
  something different . 
  great architectural lighting as well . 
  the holy roma empire is already a reality . 
  they keep stealing my wheelie bin . 
  anyone know if belarus is good for a holiday ? 
  the first domino . 
  why do you have to be so difficult ? 
  get with the burgundy programme . 
  it 's going to take the rise of the far right to deal with the immigration disaster and pending shift in demographics . 
  you mass import a backward , intolerant culture into a peaceful society and then lie about it to everyone , the far right is eventually going to win . 
  no problem , mate !, 
  i speak a bit of spanish so i recognise these pitfalls . 
  in miraculous condition . 
  it 's amazing looking around europe today and seeing how much our `` recent '' architecture is influenced by these 2000-year-old buildings . 
  if anyone 's a pillar nerd like me : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/column#classical_orders, 
  yet . 
  you call it arrogance , we call it banter . 
  lighten up , mate . 
  we need it to remind our euro mexicans who 's in charge . 
  no offence , mate , but when i saw your flair i was surprised to see a somewhat educated response below it . 
   she hates ~ ~ more ~ ~ the judges who are trying to arrest polanski ** more ** than him you ca n't put `` more '' there in english . 
  a common mistake by romance language speakers . 
  i like nigel farage . 
  great orator . 
  we wo n't be taking any advice from the likes of you . 
  know your place . 
  joke thief . 
  right , which one of you forgot to wind the clocks before launch ? 
  you had one job !, 
   redditor for 1 year  0 comment karma lurking for one year just to tell me that ? 
  i 'm honoured . 
  no surprise that you turn a reasonable discussion into a misogynistic , xenophobic attack . 
  says a lot about you . 
   germans/swedes/dutchs / danes there are more britons in spain that all these combined . 
  lose these britons and your economy will tank ever more . 
  madrid will be doing everything in its power to accommodate the british in spain . 
  is there an expression in castilian similar to * do n't bite the hand that feeds you * ? 
   gain in education and respect . 
  respect ? 
  not the first word that comes to mind . 
  gibraltar is our little reminder to you of who 's in charge here  as i said , * beggars * ca n't be choosers . 
  do n't underestimate the billions of euros british expats pour into the fragile spanish economy every year . 
  strong independent uk do n't need no eu . 
   700.000 britons living in spain the only people keeping spain 's fragile economy from complete collapse to be honest . 
  well i hope he is segregated from the rest . 
  i do n't know about turkey but are n't prisons a breeding ground for islamism for these people ? 
  i know at least in the uk and france , prisons have a high rate of conversion to islam . 
  * http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/21/political-correctness-allowing-islamist-extremism-to-flourish-in/ this is why segragation and isolation of these islamists is crucial .

  gender segregation is a cornerstone of their culture and if we want true multiculturalism in europe , we have to accept all parts of it . 
  you ca n't just pick and choose which parts of their culture is acceptable . 
  should be stickied on the top of r/europe to be honest . 
   what will we do when they create muslim parties with enough support to push their agenda in our parliaments . 
  it 's game over . 
  it has been shown time and again that these two cultures are completely incompatible with each other and can not coexist peacefully . 
  the only way this is headed is a civil war . 
  those kind of politicians will be voted in as france , and europe for that matter , continues to swing more to the right . 
  it 's a shame it has to come to this , but nobody wants segregation of women in europe . 
  i thought ` no go ' zones did n't exist ? 
  now that france24 is using the term , does that mean we can too without fear of being called racist ? 
  no , it 's just bad english . 
  thanks . 
  if i was learning a language i 'd want people to correct me . 
  clearly come people here do n't like that . 
   if i do n't remember wrong . 
  * if i remember correctly, 
  we can rule out iberia , the british isles , scandinavia and eastern europe , that 's for sure . 
  it needs to be more centrally located , either in france , germany , nl , belgium or czech rep. 
   sheep shagger jokes a n d i 've only seen london . 
  lincolnshire seems to be the worst . 
  thought as much . 
  i 'm curious as to why you mentioned wales of all places ? 
  there are far worse regions in our british isles you can take a jab at . 
  oh , you . 
  it 's a * land * alright , just not the * fin * one , 
   russia and belarus are better than romania [ yes .

   it 's devastating for the countries these migrants leave . 
  how ? 
  it 's not like they 're losing highly skilled workers . 
  it 's more devastating for the countries they 're all flooding to because now we have to support them . 
  * less safe, 
  nothing of value there . 
  never too late to make amends . 
  my money is on nl . 
  sorry poland . 
  well the italians certainly know how to village . 
  \u266b the hills are alive with the sound of . . facking england !, 
  u wot m8 !!, 
  anyone who defends the segregation of women is brainwashed and has no place in the civilised world . 
   orkney does n't even have trees , trees . 
  they ate them all , the savages . 
  your attempt at humour ails me . 
  fetch the hounds !, 
  i have a big tapa for them .
