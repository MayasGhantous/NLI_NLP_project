  then again , the existence of the republican party in the united states gives me a similar feeling !, 
  i did n't say anything about the entire serbian nation being racist because that is n't true . 
  i 'm just observing that these are things that happen in the country . 
  what about the greater serbia movement and the denial of war crimes like srebrenica ? 
  those appear to be underpinned by racist beliefs , especially in the case of the former . 
  yeah sorry but `` traditional families '' are n't really the ones this is intended to help . 
  if you 're this offended by labels on a form being changed then you have some problems . 
  absolutely nothing is stopping that . 
  all this means is families with same-sex parents are n't being discriminated against . 
  anybody who suggests it 's a racial problem off the back of this post is fucking stupid . 
  i live in central scotland and a few years ago there was a furore in my town over youths attacking fire crews attending burning buildings for absolutely no reason . 
  it 's to do with deprivation and the lack of activities and facilities available to young people . 
  what is it with serbs establishing these splinter countries ? 
  i 'm still not even sure what republika srpska is for apart for being a place to hide war criminals . 
  if you 're interested in riverside development then the clyde might be of particular interest to you - there 's been a [ number of projects ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clyde_waterfront_regeneration ) since the post-ww2 period aimed at revitalising an area previously dependent on heavy industry and shipbuilding .

   is being a traveller genetic ? 
  the implication behind this statement is that you believe they should just give up their lifestyle and be `` normal '' . 
  that 's what to do when a community feels marginalised , wipe them out !, 
  yeah !, 
  given the prejudice [ they 've ] ( http://www.chgs.umn.edu/histories/victims/romasinti/gypsies.html ) [ faced ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/30/european-union-roma-human-rights ) from non-travelers over the centuries it 's probably not entirely surprising that some communities are insular and frustrated . 
  the lack of provisions for their lifestyle does n't help things either . 
  while i 've never known any travellers personally , i know well enough not to make sweeping generalisations about such a broad demographic . 
  certainly not ones encouraging prejudice . 
  either that or you 're just a hateful shithead . 
  do these sentences seem okay to you ? 
  blacks dont face enough prejudice , fucking dickheads . 
  jews dont face enough prejudice , fucking dickheads . 
  homosexuals dont face enough prejudice , fucking dickheads . 
  if your answer is no , then what makes it acceptable to hate travellers and not some other identifiable group of people ? 
  again you 've managed to completely misunderstand my entire post . 
  my point was that in the time of stalin and mao absolutely no countries were big on rights for homosexuals or migrants , capitalist or otherwise . 
  lol okay you 're a complete shitlord gg enjoy your crass generalisations about people you know absolutely nothing about, 
  also re : mao/stalin/pol pot - try and find a capitalist country that was making strides toward social inclusion at the same time as they were ruling !, 
  nowadays leftists pursue progressive policies whereas their right-wing counterparts maintain the same regressive beliefs as their predecessors . 
   is being really tall a completely different thing to being tall ? 
  well yeah because there is a demonstrable difference between somebody who is 1.7 m tall ( like me ) and somebody who is a full 2m tall . 
  in the exact same way , there 's an enormous difference between ( for example ) being in favour of a quota-based immigration system and proposing the expulsion of all `` non-native '' people . 
  the latter of which happens to be a bnp policy !, 
   red ken suggested workers form armed milias to guard factories threatened with closure . 
  i fail to see what 's wrong with this , especially when placed into the context of the mass privatisations and lay-offs in the eighties . 
  if workers wanted to defend their right to work , more power to them . 
  you start off by talking about a two-dimensional political spectrum then go on to describe the bnp as left-wing when that 's only their economic policy . 
  good going !, 
  did you seriously just equate radical islamists and the crusaders with homosexuals and blacks fighting for their rights because if so that 's pretty fucking abhorrent ) : you 're also completely missing my point . 
  yes , organised religions ( including islam ! ), 
  are responsible for atrocities around the world . 
  however , the vast majority of practitioners of these faiths are n't like that at all . 
  i 'm talking about things like the stigmatisation of catholic migrants in 19th-century scotland and the current prejudice faced by travelling people . 
  it 's nothing more than scaremongering about people that happen to be slightly different . 
  i noticed in your post history you said you vote for the sgp , have you ever even read their manifesto ? 
  a lot of the stuff you 're spouting is pretty contrary to what they 're about !, 
  again , i was n't describing capitalists or libertarians when i said `` far-right '' . 
  it 's a completely different thing . 
   the bnp and edl are all about protectionism , nationalising industry and have solidly left wing views . 
  there 's absolutely nothing left-wing about either group . 
  leftist movements are predominantly socially progressive , whereas both of those are highly xeno/homophobic . 
   is it `` not-being-racist '' an objective truth ? 
  i do n't think i get you . 
  are you saying there 's some sort of `` good side '' to racism that needs to be considered ? 
  help me out here . 
  what you go on to describe is something that has historically been ascribed to catholics , communists , gays , gypsies , blacks and other people considered `` undesirable '' by the ruling classes at some point in history . 
  reflect on that . 
   they surround themselves with like minded people who they belive to be objectively correct because not-being-racist is such an extremist , minority view that deserves to be denounced !, 
  it does n't , but i do n't think any such critics would 've been part of this event in particular . 
  it 's just barely-veiled xenophobia , pure and simple . 
  note that i said far-right . 
  some libertarians and capitalists are progressive on social issues , just as there 's communists with socially conservative views . 
  anti-islamic sentiment is inextricably linked with far-right views . 
  the faith itself is not immune from criticism , but that 's not what 's going on here . 
  sorry but are you really equating anti-fascists with fascists themselves ? 
  because that 's just ridiculous, 
   that 's quite an assertion to make with no evidence whatsoever, 
  that 's quite an assertion to make with no evidence whatsoever, 
  somehow i think if it was a british tourist getting into a fight ( which by the way happens quite frequently if tv is to believed ) then there would n't be quite a racist picture here ) :, 
  given how goddamn terrible windows 8/rt is i could n't really care less if the eu banned it continent-wide . 
  absolutely nothing of value would be lost . 
  i 'd rather we just confiscated the assets of financial companies and used that money really !, 
  maybe i should 've been more specific - obsession with gdp as a metric for success is counter-productive . 
  nations can have increasing gdps but still have segments of society that are utterly impoverished . 
  i do n't understand the fixation with eternal growth . 
  it 's unsustainable . 
  that 's what happens with political debates !, 
  people get passionate , and sometimes that leads to ( gasp ) name-calling . 
  this does n't necessarily make them counter-productive . 
  it 's obviously important to only make assertions you can back up , though . 
  it 's a starting point for a discussion . 
  somebody could then respond with how austerity is an unfair policy geared towards maintaining a flawed system which drastically affects the less well-off and in greece 's case involves the mass selling of state assets , something which will disproportionately benefit only the very rich . 
  what the hell was wrong with his post ? 
  it did n't demonise anybody , it was just an observation . 
  an accurate one , at that . 
  is that the same socialist party of serbia that slobodan milosevic was once leader of ? 
  well dodged !, 
  e. : oh you post in r/objectivism lol, 
  oh wow , free travel !,
