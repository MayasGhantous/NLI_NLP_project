`` now let me finish : the tories . '', 
  if that 's your best guess i 'd hate to see your worst . 
  the whole scenario is a bit ridiculous - russia 's somehow managed to get away with invading eastern ukraine because of the larger number of russians living there but the same excuse wo n't fly if they try it on other areas and start to establish a pattern . 
  as for the idea that russia would nuke a european city ... never going to happen . 
  even if there were a full-scale war raging it still would n't go nuclear . 
  the distinction between tactical and strategic nuclear weapons is n't as rigid as people like to think - any deployment of nuclear weapons is a strategic decision and will provoke a united international response , possibly even nuclear . 
  putin 's not insane and he 's not stupid . 
  he knows how far he can reach and that 's nowhere near as far as you 're suggesting . 
  also you seem to be forgetting that we have allies outside of europe . 
  america and canada would n't sit by and watch russia rampage across the baltics , and australia , nz - hell even israel - would be very likely to get involved as well . 
  tl ; dr - not going to happen and even if it did , nato + friends would put a stop to it . 
  hardly comparable - for one , there 's a dirty great ocean in the way , and for two , being absorbed into another country is different to forming a union between the two . 
  not that daft - considering europe 's size it is a bit ridiculous that there are so many countries . 
  are england and scotland really that different ? 
  i do n't see it advertised from a welfare basis as much as it is from an environmental basis , as gausswanker said . 
  i try to buy british ( specifically west country ) when possible because i like supporting local farms , and i firmly believe that west country is best country . 
  it 's specifically a european robin . 
  american robins are a bit bigger and darker in colour . 
  ours is privatised but regulated by various government departments . 
  they have standards set that they must meet , and there are secondary regulations from the european government that have to be adhered to . 
  i feel like the water supply should be state-run , but i do n't really have any complaints about the current system . 
  the biggest thing that varies with your supplier ( based on region ) is usually the customer service , although the water in my home town tastes way nicer than it does in my university town . 
  \\  implying there are any actual britons over at / r/inglin . 
   clegg 's defiance ended up with him being slaughtered i 'd put that down more to people generally not trusting him ( and the lib dems at large ) after the 2010 election . 
  i 'd have voted ld for their pro-eu stance but i ca n't take them seriously after that saga . 
  i 'll happily change my mind if there are loads of people saying that they did n't vote for the lib dems because they ( the voters , i mean ) do n't support the eu , but my gut feeling is as above . 
  bath ales make a cider as well ( bounder ) , it 's my usual cider at the moment , but partly because it 's so easily available in bath . 
  i 'm a little stuck for names though , been away from home for a while so i 've not had a great deal of cider in the last few months . 
  fair point . 
  i 'm fairly pro-eu and even i still slip up and say ` europe ' when i mean ` continental europe ' or ` the continent ' . 
  it 's hard when the `` we 're a special little snowflake island '' mentality is so deeply ingrained . 
  ** uk ** ** most popular : ** probably cheap lager - carling , stella artois , carlsberg , heineken , kronenbourg are a few of the very common ones . 
  for ale it 'd probably be john smith 's , that 's the main macro ale i can think of . 
  ** best : ** people will generally have a local ( town/city or county level ) brew that they swear by . 
  for me it 'd be bath ales , i 'm a huge fan of gem ( amber ale ) and dark side ( stout ) . 
  getting a little off-topic , the uk has an amazing history of great cider . 
  there 's some terrible cider ( blackthorn , strongbow etc. 
  ) , and european ciders are gaining popularity ( stella artois cidre , rekorderlig , kopparburg ) but as with beer every town seems to have its own cider that they 'll defend with their lives . 
  i obviously have to say that somerset cider is the best , but most are tricky to find outside of the west country . 
  aspall 's ( suffolk ) is a good balance between quality and availability . 
   stella / kronenbourg are significantly more alcoholic than carling : they must be the cretin 's choice for oblivion . 
  stella is the stereotypical ` wifebeater ' lager . 
  kronenbourg is probably my favourite of the crappy lagers , if i needed to bring a large amount of cheap lager to a party that 's what i 'd choose . 
  the point is that it 's not a competition to see who can make the most important contribution to humanity . 
  why was newton removed ? 
  why get rid of faraday ? 
  adam smith was an economist so obviously he can fuck right off but should we keep boulton and watt on the # 50 forever ? 
  with the exception of some of the old # 50 notes featuring john houblon ( first governor of the bank of england ) that are still in circulation , darwin has been on notes the longest . 
  he 's the obvious choice to replace , which makes the decision to remove elizabeth fry ( two years newer than darwin ) seem a bit strange . 
  aside from the obvious sexism in the darwin/austen issue it 's also been thoroughly depressing to see people saying things like `` but darwin is the king of science !, 
  what 's jane austen ever done for society ? '' . 
  the / r/unitedkingdom thread for this was particularly awful - the reddit ` stem is best and everyone else can enjoy flipping burgers ' mentality was in full effect . 
  they 're very much looked down upon as working-class . 
  getting a visible tattoo would be just about political suicide here . 
  ouch , poor vatian city . 
  why is greece labelled as bath ? 
  i think the sign is a trapezium , not a rectangle . 
  and the beams at the side of the image are sloped rather than vertical . 
  i ca n't believe germany got there before italy or france . 
  although we had prince hazza 's royal dong in the news last year so maybe the uk are the real winners ? 
  most of the irish people i know are from northern ireland , i 've met maybe two people from the roi . 
  so a northern irish accent is what i 'm most used to . 
  if you got one of each and asked me which is which i could do it , but if i met a stranger who sounded like they were from ireland i 'd guess northern just because that 's more common down here . 
  it does n't help that i have a generally crap ear for accents - within england i can do west country , essex , london , or ` the north ' . 
  beyond that i ca n't distinguish . 
  ` ireland ' to me is the island . 
  i ca n't tell the difference between a northern ireland and a republic of ireland accent so i use it as an umbrella term to avoid potentially pissing anyone off . 
  as a uk citizen it 's weird to think that we have a separate nation just next door . 
  feels a little silly when we 're so close to each other , but i studied the irish revolution in as history so i understand that there are a tonne of varyingly-legitimate reasons for it . 
  i agree - i know it 's bad , and it 's an invasion of privacy , and this that and the other , but i just ca n't get worked up over this . 
  i gave up worrying about this sort of thing when i was 12 and read my first tom clancy book . 
  just assumed that echelon , or whatever they want to call it , has been doing this sort of thing since before i was born . 
  * kind and friendly people . 
  * crazy language - weird mix of arabic , hebrew , italian , and english as far as i can tell . 
  quite pleasant to listen to though . 
  * amazing architecture and history ( prehistoric ruins , paul 's shipwreck , the knights of st. john , siege of malta by the ottoman empire , napoleon bonaparte betrayed the knights ' trust , ww2 ) . 
  * great weather . 
  * great food and wine - met a winemaker called joe on gozo who was the nicest guy ever and taught me a lot about wine . 
  * problems with water supply - i think i 'm right in saying that there are no natural rivers or lakes on malta or gozo , so they have to get their water from underground or the sea ( which is why the tap water tastes somewhat rough ) . 
  * game of thrones was partially filmed there ( azure window and mdina , there was some issue with the azure window when the film crew spread gravel everywhere ) , and world war z was being filmed while i was last there . 
  popular for filming because of the architecture and weather . 
  * strong ties with the uk due to former ( voluntary ! ), 
  british empire status and ww2 . 
  this means they give us points in eurovision . 
  * we love you malta !, 
  why it has n't taken off more is beyond me . 
  also cisk lager . 
  been to malta & gozo a few times . 
  it 's just too lovely for words . 
  eh , it 's really no different to random vox pops from people on the street . 
  just easier to gather in a hurry . 
  super nice flag . 
  also very popular in my hometown because our rugby team uses the same blue-black-white pattern . 
  [ ( see here ) ] ( http://www.bathrugby.com/ ), 
  yeah , when someone mentions amsterdam i generally think of the anne frank museum as that 's one of my strongest memories of the city . 
  anne frank , canals , dikes , flat terrain , delicious cheese , nice architecture , football . 
  someone once told me that the easiest way to identify the countries of northern europe is to think of sweden as the penis to norway and finland 's balls . 
  which makes denmark a blob of semen en route to the breasts of germany and poland . 
  it 's gross , but it helped me remember .
