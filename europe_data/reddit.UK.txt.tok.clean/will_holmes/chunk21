  schengen is about not needing passports . 
  if they will not , and i can completely understand why they will not , then what option do they have but to invoke the guillotine clause some time between now and when the quota law comes into effect ? 
  if the euroskeptics want to actually change or lock down anything in the parliament , they 'd have to have enough seats to overcome the centre-right , centre-left , greens and the liberals combined . 
  basically the entire mainstream european political establishment . 
  that just wo n't happen , very few pro-integration parties would be willing to work with them , and in the world of parliamentary politics , that 's a one way ticket to being utterly powerless . 
  the best they can hope for is to scare the national parties into appealing to the euroskeptic electorate , like holding membership referendums . 
  in democratic institutions , it 's very hard to keep someone out of the parliaments if they still have popular support . 
  in the end , we may just have to accept that the italians vote for him and deserve everything that that implies . 
  of course their right to put a limit on immigration should be respected . 
  they are , after all , outside the eu and the eea and are completely sovereign in the matter . 
  this is something that switzerland worked hard to negotiate and retain . 
  however , this does not mean they are immune to the consequences that they wanted when they signed the swiss-eu bilateral treaties in 1994 . 
  this is n't some tit-for-tat affair , this was set up long ago with the explicit assent of both parties . 
  brit here . 
  i 've already deleted several attempts at trying to give a rundown of british politics because , frankly , the current state is really complicated and totally unprecedented . 
  here 's the policies of each important party regarding europe : ** conservatives ( blue ) ** : centre-right . 
  leadership favours smaller eu budget and is considered `` soft-euroskeptic '' , but does * not * support withdrawal of membership . 
  has a minority hard-euroskeptic faction , some of which broke off to form ukip . 
  has promised that if they are part of the next government in 2015 , they will hold a membership referendum in 2017 . 
  ** labour ( red ) ** : centre-left . 
  is considered pretty neutral on europe . 
  supports membership , but chooses to keep quiet about it . 
  ** liberal democrats ( orange ) ** : liberal centre . 
  most pro-european party , just short of joining the euro . 
  fiercely supports eu membership . 
  ** united kingdom independence party ( purple ) ** : right wing . 
  wants the uk to leave the eu and renegotiate a new relationship similar to the swiss . 
  we used to have a simple two-party system , reinforced by a first past the post electoral system , with the conservatives and labour passing power back and forth . 
  in 2010 , we had a hung parliament , with the lib dems holding the balance of power . 
  the only possible majority was a conservative-lib dem coalition , which happened after 13 years of labour majority rule . 
  ukip 's representation lies pretty much solely in the european parliament , taking over the lib dem 's former role as a protest party . 
  however , the majority of ukip 's support draws from conservative voters , which in turn weakens them at the general election . 
  the next election could be a coalition or a majority either way , with not much of a swing required to decide it , so the conservatives are trying to appeal to ukip voters to win . 
  ukip are n't expected to win a single seat , but the threat of removing the conservative 's power is making them very influential . 
  as far as i 'm aware , 5 years is a pretty average time-frame for concluding accession talks , so this is pretty reasonable . 
  at the risk of sounding like a broken record player , though , it still may depend on if and how quickly the kosovo issue is resolved . 
  i 'm not actually sure . 
  i would think it would have to go through the council by qualified majority and the parliament like everything else . 
  it would be a bit weird if the commission could just cut off a treaty bloc unilaterally . 
  the eu and switzerland have a unique arrangement which allows switzerland to participate in the single market without being in the eu , in the form of a series of treaties which are pretty similar to the laws applied by european economic area countries like iceland and norway . 
  one of them is a commitment to freedom of movement , one is schengen membership , others comprise the majority of eu law , including the four freedoms . 
  the difference is that switzerland or the eu has the right to refuse and cancel these treaties at any time . 
  this mechanism is the guillotine clause , because it cancels every treaty at once , and switzerland will be ejected from the single market entirely . 
  it 's a way of giving switzerland technical sovereignty over the matter , but in reality they 're held by the balls and apply everything the eu throws at them . 
  until now . 
  we just think it 's hilarious and fun , in a `` so bad it 's good '' way . 
  if switzerland succeeds despite being guillotined , then we 'll be seeing the breakup of the eu because there would evidently be no point of it . 
  however , how on earth could they succeed in the first place ? 
  switzerland is not strictly in the eea in that they have not signed that particular treaty , but the treaties they have signed with the eu effectively makes them a part of the eea . 
  oh no you did n't !, 
  yeah , but when they were fully independent , most of the time everyone else was . 
  it was an even playing field where everyone could play everyone else against each other economically . 
  nowadays , switzerland would be surrounded by the eea without being part of it , and that is not a plus when it is trying to compete for investment with nearby countries like germany or austria . 
  i think the bbc is missing an important detail here . 
  when it says  brussels has made it very clear that although switzerland is not in the eu , it can not simply abandon aspects of eu policy which are unpopular with its citizens , such as free movement , and keep the popular ones , such as access to europe 's single market . 
  this is n't just an opinion , this is a principle that is integrated in the treaties that define the relationship between switzerland and the eu . 
  if switzerland stops the principle of free movement or otherwise opts out of schengen , * all * of the treaties are revoked due to the guillotine clause . 
  switzerland will then be a completely separate state , and that will have massive consequences . 
  if they want to participate in the free market , they have to have open borders . 
  i do n't know what the swiss people 's party thinks it 's going to achieve here , but it 's either going to be greater european integration ( true european economic area membership ) , or complete and utter isolation and economic turmoil . 
  the eu wo n't give them another set of treaties if the swiss voluntarily goes back on the last set . 
  if you 're swiss and want switzerland to join the eu , i can see , tactically speaking , why you 'd vote yes . 
  otherwise , it 's just insane economic suicide . 
  i hope this can work out . 
  yeah , but in order to negotiate a visa-free travel agreement requires cooperation in the first place . 
  nope , we have n't had a referendum yet . 
  all of our three main national parties still support membership to greater or lesser extents , it 's just that one of them openly supports having a referendum in the next parliament . 
  the party that supports withdrawel , ukip , has no representation nationally due to the first past the post system . 
  for as long as putin is in power , i do n't see cooperation happening . 
  there 's too much concflict of geopolitical interest as the putin administration tries to draw a border with the eu by forming the customs union in places which the eu one day hopes to bring into itself . 
  russia is also a thorn in the side of other countries like moldova and georgia , also potential eu candidates . 
  there 's just too strong of a sense that the russian sphere and the european sphere are rivals ; not enemies , but certainly not friends . 
  considering that the swiss federal assembly is [ really really diverse ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_assembly_ ( switzerland \\ ) ) , and the article only lists one backing party for this , i get the feeling messing with schengen and invoking the guillotine clause is n't actually a popular or likely thing . 
  i hope the conservatives and euroskeptics field candidates so we can get a tv debate going without leaving anyone out . 
  nice . 
  bigger single power markets inherently bring about greater stability , and ones which cover greater areas of land makes renewables much more effective . 
  the wind is usually blowing somewhere in europe !, 
  i think it 's more that they become more comfortable with the status quo . 
  not really a nuanced argument , but i can see why it 's compelling . 
  why would they want to change their situation when it 's currently serving them well ? 
  i think we must n't lose sight of why we have national elections in the first place . 
  voting is n't merely giving an opinion , it 's having a say in the laws that affect you . 
  if the people you 're voting for ca n't table laws that affect you , then the cycle is broken and democracy does n't work . 
  i do n't think expats should be able to vote in their previous state of residence , they should be able to vote in their * current * state of residence , with a grace period ( cyprus ' rule of residing six months before the election seems sensible ) . 
  obviously your right to vote in the european elections does n't need a grace period because you never left the jurisdiction of the eu , but you should only be able to vote for the candidates where you are resident . 
  putin , you ca n't piss us off and try to gain our friendship at the same time . 
  it does n't work that way . 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  makes me wonder if the same thing will happen in the uk . 
  not that i really care , it barely takes any more effort to make a bookmark . 
  i 've only had to change it once since they banned it , which took all of 20 seconds . 
  i think you 're doing a good thing by giving us a view of the bad things that are happening too . 
  there are obviously things wrong with all three of those countries which make them currently ineligible for eu membership , but we should outline what those things are instead of hiding behind the word `` european '' . 
  why not tell these countries how to make themselves better and more stable nations instead of assuming that they could never achieve that ? 
  as far as i 'm concerned , the `` european '' in the name `` european union '' is n't really a geographical term , it 's a standard of governance and political stability and a set of social freedoms that originates from the area called `` europe '' . 
  i reiterate that i do n't support these countries joining now , but i do n't think there 's anything inherent about their geographical location that will stop them from reaching the same standards that we hold our countries to . 
  yeah , precisely . 
  it makes me sad that morocco was rejected because it was n't `` european '' , instead of genuinely addressing why morocco would n't qualify and leaving the option of improvement open . 
  i mean , how is it consistent that we 're trying to get bosnia and harzegovina to join , which is still trying to resolve itself as a single country , but not morocco ? 
  why not dangle membership over israel if they sort themselves out with the palestinians ?
