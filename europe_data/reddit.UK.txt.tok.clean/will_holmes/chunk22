  i just think that leaving eu membership open has an extraordinary amount of power that is n't being used to its full potential . 
  i 'm not saying let these countries join right now or even any time soon , but if we leave the option available to them , what 's the harm ? 
  i 'd be for the caucasus being unrestricted in their application for membership , especially if georgia joins , and broadly speaking i do n't think it 's too helpful to pre-emptively draw the lines for what qualifies as `` european '' , even though we could all formally decide what the region is if we wanted to . 
  if a country borders an eu member state , or can be easily accessed by an eu member state by sea ( e.g. 
  borders the mediterranean ) , then that 's all we should look for in geographical terms . 
  there 's far more important things that a country needs to qualify for membership . 
  i do n't think sweden will leave , that 's my point . 
  they 've got an effective opt-out of the euro by not pegging the krona , but like the uk , they could choose to join if they wanted to . 
  i just think it 's ridiculous to suggest that having an opt-out of the euro , of all things , would be the reason why the uk would leave the eu . 
  do you think sweden and denmark will eventually leave as well then ? 
  our politics is dominated by businesses , if the euro starts outperforming the pound , believe me when i say the tide will turn very quickly . 
  it 's the eurozone 's job to prove that a single currency is better , and if they do that , they 'll get the uk . 
  if they do n't , why should we join ? 
  there 's no `` real '' reason , no . 
  it 's a free language and people can evolve the definitions , but if they call it a service , people are going to think that it 's a gathering of people proclaiming about how fake god is or something . 
  it gives the wrong impression . 
  i believe the common phrase is that english should be the `` official second language '' of the eu . 
  and yeah , i think it would be a brilliant idea , europe would work so much better with a common language , but i ca n't see france agreeing to it . 
  it does , actually . 
  when you use it to mean a type of event , calling it a `` service '' means it is of an organised religious nature . 
  why ca n't it be a mixture of those things ? 
  i think there was an element of a moral right in terms of honouring the election of a majority nationalist regional government , everyone just kind of assumed it when the modern scottish parliament was created , in the same way that the northern irish assembly does in the event of a nationalist majority . 
  that said , it 's also true that cameron was extremely eager to embrace the referendum because he knew resisting it in any way would increase the snp 's chances of a victory in the long run . 
   the new extreme-right coalition of marine le pen ( fr , front national ) , geert wilders ( nl , pvv ) and others could endanger the far-right efd group of nigel farage ( pictured ) and the ukip party they do heavily imply it , though , and considering how efd is commonly considered `` greater ukip '' i still do n't think it 's fair language . 
  and yeah , that is quite interesting how we wo n't have any properly far-right parties in any elected positions . 
  the british national party was the ultimate trainwreck , people are strongly predicting they wo n't get any seats this year . 
  [ this one caught my attention . 
  ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/eu-elections-2014/eurosceptics-compete-efd-groups-news-532158 ) interesting what they 're saying about how the efd group will struggle to meet the threshold if lega nord joins a new nationalist group . 
  if they fail , farage will lost a fair bit of influence , but will be replaced with people like wilders and le pen . 
  i think it would be a pity , because i think there is a difference between being merely euroskeptic and being a far-right nationalist , which is something which euractiv fails to understand . 
  their habit of referring to ukip and efd as far-right is ignorant of the realities of the world of euroskeptic politics , and is frankly quite damaging . 
  they will only get stronger if they 're treated in a dismissive way , and that 's a bad thing for everyone . 
  guilty as charged . 
  we 're europeans . 
  we do n't tell people who they ca n't love . 
  somehow our far-right parties are much more stupid than elsewhere , and that 's saying something . 
  well , the council could potentially refuse to nominate whomever the parliament favours , but that would just mean deadlock ( no president , no commission , no proposed laws ) and would n't achieve much . 
  for gay marriages , gay couples use the same laws regarding their marriage as straight couples , especially for tax and adoption purposes . 
  there is no separation between gay marriage and straight marriage , both are simply addressed as the same thing in the eye of the law . 
  gay civil unions are not the same as marriages in that they 're addressed separately in legislation . 
  they 're usually ( but not necessarily ) treated in exactly the same way as marriages , but this has to be stipulated in legislation in each case . 
  i 'd love to see a slideshow of the development of this euler diagram over time . 
  i love the addition of the customs union , it gets ever more complicated !, 
  at some point the ovals and circles are going to stop working . 
  the less reliant we are on russia , the less powerful they are and the more powerful we are . 
  yes , there is . 
  the tories do n't want to leave , but they need to satisfy the ukip vote . 
  i have a horrible feeling i 'm going to regret saying that haha . 
  i live next to a country called the `` republic of ireland '' , even though it does n't have sovereignty over all of ireland , nor does it claim it . 
  we do n't insist it call itself the `` republic of southern ireland '' or anything , we just say `` okay , do your thing '' . 
  that 's why i think the macedonia naming dispute is ridiculous . 
  you know what , you 're completely right , and we 'll never really escape from that . 
  even if we had a world government , we 'll be nationalistic about that . 
  that said , being nationalistic about a diverse region is much more inclusive and morally positive than being nationalistic about a smaller , more homogeneous one . 
  if we learn to be friends even though we have differences instead of rejecting others despite our common principles , that makes us better people . 
  we might still be nationalists ( a.k.a. 
  `` humans '' ) at heart , but at least we 'll be more tolerant and more inclusive nationalists . 
  i 'll break it down . 
  some are much much much more possible than others . 
  * ** switzerland ** is a very challenging question , and i do n't really see them joining . 
  neutrality is their thing , their identity and all that is swiss , and there would have to be a huge generational and cultural shift . 
  on that kind of timescale , anything could happen , but i 'd eat a sock if it happened in my lifetime . 
  * ** liechtenstein ** is heavily associated with switzerland ( such as their monetary union ) and essentially has a shared destiny with it . 
  to make matters worse they 're also a microstate , which the eu is currently not designed for . 
  to top it off , prince hans-adam ii of liechtenstein still has real political power , which is currently incompatible with eu standards of democracy , although i can see reform happening if membership becomes favourable enough for switzerland joining . 
  i consider it the least likely country to join in this list , although that does n't make it impossible . 
  * ** iceland ** is currently a candidate for membership , although they 've currently halted negotiations because their current government opposes eu membership , and there 's a bit of conflict regarding fishing rights , an issue very important to icelanders . 
  that said , i can see things changing in the future , and if the economic state of europe improves , it wo n't take much for iceland to resume talks and eventually join . 
  * ** norway ** is all about the oil . 
  they 'll stay out of europe while they have it so as to reap the benefits in full , and join when the oil and the money from that oil runs out . 
  it may take an economic downturn at the right time to achieve this , however , norwegians are very economically comfortable at the moment and have no desire to change the status quo until change is forced on them . 
  * ** the microstates and city-states ** of monaco , san marino , andorra and liechtenstein are prevented from joining because the eu has no special provisions for them and currently does not offer much in the way of benefits for these already deeply integrated countries . 
  the only real offer they could have would be a say in eu legislation . 
  i can imagine the eu offering a special type of membership which gives them only 2 seats in the european parliament . 
  it 's also worth noting that san marino recently had a referendum on applying for membership which was higher than 50 % , but did not achieve enough participation to force their government to take action . 
  i see them joining if the eu gives them some kind of deal , but right now the eu has more pressing matters to deal with . 
  * ** bosnia-herzegovina ** wo n't be joining until it becomes more stable as a single country instead of a partial fusion of two countries who have n't quite resolved their differences and put the past behind them . 
  do n't expect them to join any time soon , but time does heal all wounds eventually . 
  * ** montenegro ** is already a candidate for joining , but needs to work on improve the rule of law in the country . 
  the commission has taken a favourable view of its status as a candidate , and things are moving positively for the country . 
  accession negotiations are ongoing , and there are no obvious diplomatic blocks to accession . 
  expect them to join around the turn of this decade . 
  * ** albania ** is a potential candidate country , where accession negotiations are expected to commence within the next few months . 
  it has a serious problem with the rule of law and corruption , but this is something to work on , and like montenegro , has no diplomatic blocks to accession . 
  it can feasibly join , but it 's going to be a slow process . 
  see how it goes next decade , they might be in montenegro 's current position at that point . 
  * ** macedonia ** has the diplomatic block in the form of the ( in my opinion ridiculous ) naming dispute . 
  regardless of opinion , it 's straining relations with greece and bulgaria . 
  additionally , cyprus and malta currently do not have diplomatic relations with them . 
  this dispute has to be resolved before accession can happen , and nobody knows how long that will take . 
  * ** serbia and kosovo ** are complicated . 
  serbia is keen to join and accession negotiations are due to start on january 21 , but the kosovo dispute threatens to stall accession . 
  serbia claims that kosovo is part of its own territory , and 5 other eu members do not recognise kosovo 's independence . 
  while recognising kosovo is not a formal requirement to join ( as it is not an eu member ) , many feel that letting serbia join before it recognises kosovo will be untenable . 
  of course , kosovo can not join unless all member states recognise it . 
  in other areas serbia 's efforts to join have been positive . 
  you 're ridiculously talented , this is a really powerful image . 
  at last , someone with sense here . 
  not that i recall . 
  hell , when the whole syria thing was kicking off , the prime minister could authorise it without debate and was largely expected to , but there was such a big call for an emergency debate and vote that we had one and it was rejected .
