  you know it 's bad when i could guess italy with quite a lot of confidence . 
  not yet , anyway . 
  are you actually going to get round to explaining what was wrong with my point about proportional contributions or are you just going to keep moaning ? 
  i 'm only fine with it if all member states foot the bill proportionally , and considering the difference in opinion on defence policy for various equally valid reasons , i doubt all member states would be willing to do this . 
  otherwise , the eu will just be mooching off us and france . 
  honestly , i do n't see it happening . 
  we call it `` wife beater '' . 
  ooh , i did n't realise that an association agreement was on the cards . 
  i mistakenly assumed that ukraine was too far under russia 's shadow like belarus . 
  the relationship has fundamentally changed . 
  if anything , we agreed to start dating back in the 70 's , and today we find that we 're married with kids . 
  maybe every 20 years would be okay . 
  really , i 'm all for staying , but i have to support a referendum on moral grounds , it 's not right if this is happening against the will of the british people . 
  if we had a referendum sooner like , say , the netherlands , support for eu membership would be much higher , and i blame the past governments , particularly the brown administration when the lisbon treaty was drawn , for not dealing with this when it was much easier to handle . 
  it 's about permission , at the end of the day . 
  people do n't like this happening without them being asked . 
  we 'd never be in this mess if we had a referendum every decade or so . 
  what can the eu do ? 
  it was n't created with dealing with this kind of thing in mind . 
  we still need to trade with them , and the single market is still a work in progress . 
  i 'm completely useless at all of these `` state codes '' . 
  one day i 'll just have to sit down and learn them . 
  at least the uk is easy haha . 
  `` black market '' , 
  people do n't vote for people who are too young , for the same reason why they ca n't get jobs ; competing candidates can just fire the `` inexperienced '' line at them again and again . 
  youth and fresh ideas , despite being exactly what we need right now , are no longer as valuable and can rarely compete with experience . 
   and the republican community is more obsessed with being irish than the people that live in the republic of ireland . 
  this is because both groups feel that their identity is at stake . 
  this does n't make either of their identities false . 
  that 's completely true , but it makes both ni unionist and ni republican identities divergent from the identities of either great britain or the republic of ireland respectively . 
  while it would piss both sides off to suggest this , northern ireland is culturally like an individual country from the rest of the isles . 
  firstly , i 'm not left-wing , nor am i a republican . 
  come visit on / r/ukpolitics . 
   also , i stand by my `` we '' . 
  the unionist community in ni is undeniably more patriotic and obsessed with being `` british '' than the people who live on great britain are . 
  it 's not just the flag burning , it 's the graffiti , it 's the riots about a stupid flag on the assembly hall , it 's ultimately the culture that makes these things happen . 
  i understand why it is that way , but i 'm frustrated at the slow pace of change even as a new generation comes around . 
  as for saying the `` unionists in northern ireland are n't as irish as people in the republic of ireland '' , it 's basically because it 's nonsensical . 
  the word `` irish '' has so many meanings , and none of them are quantifiable in a way that allows the phrase `` more irish '' to makes sense . 
  i personally think that we should have a nuclear power plant in norfolk , but despite the wide variety of viable locations it 's never going to happen . 
  cool . 
  i learned something today !, 
  thank you random helpful swedish guy !, 
  the problem is that nowadays we do n't think that it 's very `` british '' to use patriotism in this way . 
  we simply do n't see these people , be it the irish or the spanish , as the enemy , and both northern ireland and gibraltar gravitate towards a vision of britishness that no longer exists . 
  it 's really difficult to get rid of the accusations of being a colonial power yearning for the empire while trying to respect the right to self-determination already . 
  having these people burning the flags of our allies while calling them the `` enemy '' and waving the union flag simply does not help . 
  they are not the enemy , these territories are just the results of a game played by our ancestors . 
  ah right . 
  the words are similar though , i 'm guessing that 's not a coincidence ? 
   sm\u00f6rrebr\u00f6d is that the origin of the `` smorgasbord '' ? 
  it seems to me that the energy policies of all sides of the political spectrum are pretty deficient . 
  the right hate wind energy , the left hate nuclear . 
  occasionally , vice versa becomes true as well . 
  the driving forces on both sides are nimbyism and ignorance . 
  it 's just how both communities have become exaggurated caricatures of the cultures of the uk and roi . 
  here on great britain , we 're nowhere near as patriotic and we consider all irish people as our brothers on the other island , whom we would defend in their time of need . 
  i 'm pretty sure the citizens of the republic feel the same way . 
  i agree it 's that it 's not that we do n't care , it 's just that everyone outside of ni shies away from it because it represents a warped and corrupted version of ourselves . 
  i really want to see the results of the election determining the ideological direction of europe . 
  if that does n't happen , the elections are pointless . 
  mainly because nobody considered putting in clauses in the terms of eu membership to address the hypothetical situation of a member state splitting in two . 
  scotland has to be added to the membership list , and the only legal way to do that is through the accession process . 
  scotland 's constitution would have to be scrutinised so it 's accepted as sufficiently democratic and respects the rule of law . 
  that said , it would just choose to adopt all uk common law until that date so it would be a formality . 
  the main problem is whether the eu would be willing to give them the same opt-outs as it did to the uk , which the other member states have a right to withold from indy scotland . 
  you can either choose to believe the british people have a right to self-determination or you do n't . 
  i think it 's fair to say that a referendum is without question the right path purely on moral grounds . 
  i personally believe that voting to stay in is the right path on pragmatic grounds . 
  just pointing out that i believe scotland would be considered a `` new '' country and the rest of the uk would be the legal continuation of the current uk with a border change . 
  rarely do these things end up being the dissolution of the whole country and the creation of two new ones . 
  that said , assuming that the other eu states allow it , i would expect succession from the uk and accession to the eu would be carried out simultaneously . 
  i think the public largely knows who he is , it 's more that they do n't care . 
  iceland has such a teeny-tiny population , it 's getting towards microstate territory , but it makes for interesting politics when a single vote has such a high relative value . 
  / r/yurop , of course !, 
  yup , though they 're the smallest represented party with 5 % of the vote and not much influence during this term . 
  i 'm impressed by the existence of a perfectly even coalition . 
  negotiations must be very interesting between the two parties . 
  that said , icelandic politics is not my strong point , but it sounds unlikely to happen . 
  any political party worth its salt is going to consider the stability of their coalition as more important . 
  just to save time , i 'll put up the numbers in the althing ( icelandic parliament ) :  ** government ( 38 ) **  progressive party - 19  independence party - 19  ** opposition ( 25 ) **  social democratic alliance - 9  left-green movement - 7  bright future - 6  pirate party - 3 ^ ( ( what is this , a parliament for ants ? 
  no , but would n't it be cool if they were ? 
  we ca n't make up our minds because we have n't had a eu referendum in a long time . 
  for that to happen fairly , we need a new treaty to define what the eu is going to be in the future . 
  unfortunately , nobody seems to want to start a new treaty . 
  why ? 
  because it will trigger a referendum of course !, 
  ugh , seriously shitty situation . 
  watch as we vote in labour in 2015 like lemmings and they use that as a mandate to say the uk did n't want a referendum in the first place . 
  i want us to stay in the eu , but we need to have a referendum on it to establish some kind of democratic commitment . 
  ugh , thanks for letting me know . 
  but the ( northern ) macedonians do not ? 
  turkey i get , but this whole situation with the name of macedonia is the most petty international conflict i 've ever heard . 
  call it the republic of northern macedonia and be done with it . 
  seriously , we do n't complain about the name of the republic of ireland . 
  that too . 
  turkey is ahead , but its situation is deteriorating , whereas kosovo ( and serbia , whose candidacies are pretty firmly linked ) seems to be more willing to resolve its problems . 
  we keep on talking about turkey despite the fact that the current government is breaking the principles of secular governance , is not respecting the right to peaceful protest , and is illegally occupying the territory of a member state . 
  let 's cross the bridge of accession talks when we come to it , which is not for at least a decade , let 's face it . 
  we should be talking about places like serbia and kosovo , iceland , fyrom and bosnia instead .
