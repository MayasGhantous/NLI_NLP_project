  nah , he is a bit short , around 5 ' 6 . 
  hate to break your bubble , but neither napoleon nor hitler were much different from the average height at that time . 
  they get their reputation for being short because of propaganda . 
   i used to think war in europe was impossible . 
  never again . 
  and i 'm not talking about ww3 , just about what 's happening now . 
  it 's going to be one of those great ironies of this period of history . 
  the eu really did make war unthinkable within the member states and its sphere of influence , but it indirectly causes conflict and rivalry at the countries just beyond the borders . 
  turns out it 's hard to kill war , but much easier to move it elsewhere . 
  juncker 's lost sight of the fact that the commission are n't representatives of the people , they 're representatives of each of the national legislatures . 
  if they were representatives of the people , they 'd be directly elected . 
  since the national legislatures are themselves very dominated by men for various reasons , it is not surprising that statistically most of them would pick a man if they were simply looking for the most suitable person amongst them to be their commissioner . 
  if he forces the renomination of commissioners , or arranges the portfolios by gender , that actually makes the commission as a whole * less * legitimate , as it would n't be representative of the thing it is supposed to represent . 
  either rethink who the commissioners are meant to represent and adjust their election/appointment procedures accordingly , or live with it for now and encourage the national legislatures themselves to be more gender balanced . 
  preferably both . 
  he should n't pretend that the european commission is something more noble than it really is . 
  i think this sounds like a good idea . 
  i think it 's the only national anthem that ends in `` oi ! '' . 
  brilliant . 
  quelle surprise . 
  the socialist party 's economic policies do n't work , and they fire anyone who points this out . 
  yes , of course . 
  there 's no point breaking up families . 
  nah , people generally do n't actually know or care much about the cap , it does n't really factor in much outside the agricultural community . 
  it 's not an eu thing . 
  i 'm sure that beef and lamb and everything else is just as good in terms of standards in france . 
  with apologies for my earlier spelling , foie gras does basically taint the image of everything else . 
  since they would n't be eu citizens , they would n't have a right to work anywhere other than estonia until they gained citizenship , which itself means naturalisation , learning the language , and knowing the culture . 
  plus , giving them a legal route to gain the rights to live and work in the countries that they really want to go to is a great incentive for them to bother getting citizenship . 
  if we had a single distributive system for asylum seeking , they would n't be able to claim asylum in different eu member states any more than they could claim asylum twice in the same country . 
  well , it looks like there 's already one to the french side of the channel crossing to britain , so we 're halfway there . 
  but seriously , i think it 's probably the fairest way . 
  distribute them proportionally according to population . 
  everyone 's waiting for the the results of the investigation . 
  funnily enough , our animal welfare nationalism often includes ireland . 
  buy meat from british or irish farmers , as they say . 
  it 's more on the basis of environmentalism and less fuel spent on transport , but i do n't think there 's much respect for french animal farming ( and i say this in the serious sense , and not in the `` let 's joke about the french '' sense ) . 
  fois gras is quite a contentious topic . 
  are they not thwarting the rebels ? 
  i thought that was the whole point of everyone being scared of russia invading , because the rebels were on the path of losing the war . 
  well , this is awkward . 
  i think our rampant binge drinking culture does n't help either . 
  if kazakhstan applied to join the eu , it means that something has fundamentally changed to russia , such as a revolution or breakup . 
  it also means that something 's fundamentally changed about kazakhstan too . 
  if that 's happened , then all bets on what `` europe '' means have been called off . 
  the answer can only be `` maybe '' or `` it depends '' . 
  you do n't know what it 's about . 
  all this stuff has to go through congress , the european parliament , and all 28 member state parliaments in full disclosure . 
  i can summarise the groups for you , if you like . 
  there are 7 groups , from left to right ; ** european united left/nordic green left ** - a.k.a. 
  `` the left '' , consisting of communist , anti-capitalist and hard-left parties . 
  wants to disband nato , and opposes the current political structure of the eu , but is still committed to integration . 
  a small and confederal group , whose most notable member is syriza , the greek leading opposition party which upset the greek establishment in 2012 . 
  ** progressive alliance of socialists and democrats ** - a.k.a. 
  `` the socialists '' , the major ( and second largest ) group which is made up of pro-european centre-left parties . 
  with members from each state , it usually governs in coalition with the other major group , the european people 's party . 
  the president of the european parliament ( essentially the `` speaker '' ) , martin schultz , is a member of the socialists and democrats . 
  ** the greens/european free alliance ** - a.k.a. 
  `` greens/efa '' is a group of two halves seeking mutual co-operation to meet the threshold to form a group . 
  the european green party basically covers every `` green party '' in europe , prioritising green politics , with a moderately pro-eu stance . 
  the european free alliance consists of progressive parties advocating the interests of non-state regions and minorities , notable members being the scottish national party and the new flemish alliance , which desire independence for their respective regions . 
  a very small group , but occasionally in a politically powerful position to broker compromises and secure majorities . 
  ** alliance of liberals and democrats for europe ** - a.k.a. 
  `` the lib dems '' or `` alde '' , another minor group consisting of liberal and centrist parties . 
  they most strongly advocate integration and european federalism of all the groups , and usually participate in the cooperation process of the two major pro-eu groups , the socialists and the european people 's party . 
  ** the european people 's party ** - a.k.a. 
  `` the epp '' , the biggest group in the parliament , the centre-right counterpart to the socialist 's centre-left policies . 
  it is pro-eu and consists of christian democratic and moderately conservative parties . 
  recently won the somewhat controversial competition to nominate and elect the european commission president this year , electing jean-claude juncker of luxembourg . 
  the most notable member is the german christian democratic union , led by chancellor angela merkel . 
  ** european conservatives and reformists ** - a.k.a. 
  `` the conservatives '' or `` the ecr '' . 
  the largest of the minor groups , the ecr fragmented from the european people 's party in opposition to its pro-europeanism in 2009 . 
  centre-right like the epp , it is a soft-euroskeptic and anti-federalist group which advocates political reform of the eu to a looser arrangement that still maintains the single market . 
  mainly led by the conservative party of the united kingdom , and the law and justice party of poland . 
  ** europe of freedom and direct democracy ** - a.k.a. 
  `` the euroskeptics '' are the established hard-euroskeptic group in the parliament . 
  right-wing , but not far-right , the group was established and led by nigel farage and the united kingdom independence party under the name `` europe of freedom and democracy '' . 
  it advocates the withdrawal of their respective countries from the eu . 
  while ukip has performed ever stronger in each election in the uk , the group struggled to meet the threshold to keep its official group status in 2014 . 
  it was saved by beppe grillo 's five star movement from italy , a fairly successful populist and anti-establishment party . 
  the five star movement now co-presides with ukip , and added the word `` direct '' to its name . 
  ** non-inscrits ** - the european parliament 's version of independents , they are unique in that they can not attend committees , and do not have other resources allocated to recognised groups . 
  most ( but not all ) members are far-right nationalists , notably france 's front national , hungary 's jobbik , and greece 's golden dawn amongst others . 
  it is largely populated by the result of the failed attempt to form a far-right 8th group in 2014 , the european alliance for freedom , which could only gain support from meps from 6 states instead of the required 7 . 
  mary i ( a.k.a. 
  `` bloody mary '' ) had a legacy of being a bloodthirsty and tyrannical queen who ruthlessly persecuted protestants . 
  oliver cromwell , the lord protector who ruled when the monarchy was temporarily abolished , is not so much hated as a very divisive figure . 
  sounds like russia 's feeling the heat . 
  not surprised in the slightest . 
  the story seemed really off . 
  they have plenty of other means of taking down people . 
  it 's just that none of them ( barring freak accidents which ca n't be controlled for ) are lethal . 
  it 's a system that patently works . 
  eh , he should have called the police . 
  we 're sorry you had to find out this way . 
  sure , i do n't see the harm , but i do n't think anything unusual will be found . 
  there was no distress signal , after all . 
  `` they 're not football teams , you 're an idiot '' would be my answer . 
  honestly , what would they do if they 're at such a public place like a train station ?
