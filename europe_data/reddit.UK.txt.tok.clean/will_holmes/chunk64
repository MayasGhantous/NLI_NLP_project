  the prevailing opinion on the house of lords , at least as far as i 've seen on the uk politics subreddits , is that it 's actually quite clever institution that fixes some of the problems of pure representative democracy , and that it needs relatively minor reform , though reducing the number of lords and the power of the lords spiritual is one of them . 
  but we 've gone off topic , the conversation is about first past the post and the us . 
  duverger 's law , which states that first past the post electoral systems tend to favour two-party systems , is n't absolute and is n't sufficient to explain why there literally are only two represented parties both at a federal level and ( i think ) at every state legislature . 
  to be fair , we have first past the post in the uk and at least small parties survive with a few representatives , and sometimes they force coalitions if the numbers stack up right like they do right now . 
  the us 's situation is evidence that corruption and collusion between the two major parties is going on more than can be explained by fptp . 
  in terms of which country you plan to stay in when , you really need n't worry . 
  spain , germany , italy and all the countries in-between are all in the schengen area , which means that you can freely cross the internal borders whenever you like with no need for prior arrangements . 
  it 's because we ( the uk and the republic of ireland ) have a sort of mini-schengen of our own called the common travel area , that also includes the crown dependencies ( little pseudo-self governing islands around the isles ) . 
  i would call the democrats part of the centre-right , alongside the german christian democratic union or the french union for a popular movement . 
  the republicans are solidly in the right wing , around ukip territory . 
  pretty sure you just answered your own question ? 
  the russian government is now somewhat of an existential threat to some eastern european countries , which ca n't be said for the american government . 
  domestic american politics is considered stupid and not in the interest of american citizens , but americans do n't seem to mind that much so it 's not really our business . 
  they 'd be listed under syriza . 
  campaigning under a group name is actually banned . 
  there is actually a system for the registration of pan-european political parties or `` europarties '' which can campaign under a unified banner , but so far none other than the european green party ( which usually call themselves some linguistic variant of `` the greens '' ) have really attempted this properly . 
  nobody really pays much attention to the europarty system and would rather just look at the 7 groups to make sense of such a diverse and complicated parliament . 
  when it comes to elections to the european parliament , it helps to consider that it is essentially a melting pot of lots of already established democratic systems , some relatively new and some truly ancient . 
  every member state is given a certain amount of seats which they are to elect amongst themselves using an electoral system that they prefer , on the caveat that it has to be some flavour of proportional representation . 
  the number of seats are allocated a bit like the electoral college in the us ; smaller states get more seats per person then larger ones , and the minimum number of seats a state can have is 6 . 
  as it currently stands , only national-level parties have a chance of getting seats , and instead , like-minded parties in the europarl team up into groups or `` parties of parties '' . 
  being in a group means that you get extra funding and facilities from the eu and qualify for participation in committees , which shape proposals for legislation before they are put to a general vote at the entire parliament . 
  there are 751 seats , elected all at once every 5 years . 
  germany is the largest state with 96 seats , and estonia , cyprus , luxembourg and malta have 6 seats each . 
  as it currently stands , there are 7 official groups . 
  from largest to smallest : ** ( 219 ) european people 's party : ** centre-right pro-european christian democrats . 
  leaders include angela merkel , nicolas sarkozy and silvio berlusconi . 
  controls the commission presidency with jean-claude juncker , and generally leads the government . 
  ** ( 191 ) socialists & democrats : ** centre-left pro-european social democrats . 
  leaders include matteo renzi and fran\u00e7ois hollande . 
  usually works in coalition with the epp to secure a majority . 
  ** ( 71 ) european conservatives & reformists : ** centre-right to right soft-euroskeptics , favouring legislative reform instead of either federalism or dissolution of the eu . 
  leaders include david cameron . 
  sometimes leads the opposition , other times supports the epp . 
  ** ( 68 ) alliance of liberals & democrats for europe : ** centrist , euro-federalist liberals . 
  leaders include mark rutte . 
  often acts as mediator between epp and s&d as an optional third coalition partner . 
  ** ( 52 ) european united left/nordic green left : ** left to far-left soft-euroskeptic socialists and communists . 
  leaders include alexis tsipras . 
  usually in opposition . 
  ** ( 50 ) the greens/european free alliance : ** centre-left to left alliance of regionalist parties and green parties . 
  usually in opposition . 
  ** ( 48 ) europe of freedom and direct democracy : ** right to far-right hard euroskeptics , favouring the dissolution of the eu . 
  leaders include nigel farage and beppe grillo . 
  almost always in opposition . 
  that leaves ** ( 52 ) non-inscrits ** , which are basically independents , but are overwhelmingly populated by far-right nationalists . 
  i 'm trying to think of a more efficient way to start a war in europe than this and i ca n't come up with anything . 
  i know i 'm british and everything , but i 'd like to point out that the public largely does n't know or care about ttip at all , so you 'd only be hearing from people or media groups who are unusually passionate about it . 
  in norfolk , uk , where i live , country music has an unusually high following , but nowhere else in the uk that i know of . 
  since you 'll already be in london , may i suggest looking at [ eurostar ] ( http://www.eurostar.com/ ) ? 
  it 's a high-speed inter-state train line which links london st. pancras station to various cities in france ( calais , lille , paris , avignon ) , and also to brussels in belgium . 
  alternatively , try exploring england outside of london , as london is quite unlike the rest of england or the uk . 
  it depends on what you 're in to , to be honest . 
  brussels is quite interesting because it 's the ultimate collision of european cultures , and you can immerse yourself into it better because basically everybody there is highly multi-lingual , so you 'll do wonderfully with just english and a tiny bit of french . 
  i walked into a bar in brussels once , was served by a romanian lady who casually talked with us in excellent english , while talking with other locals in french , german , and turkish . 
  wait , are we talking about unique university-issued ids or proper state-issued voting-and-taxes ids ? 
  in the uk we do n't have the latter at all , but my university issued us with custom ids with our picture on . 
  you could enter the campus freely without one , as well as the main lecture building , but the areas with sensitive or valuable equipment ( labs etc. ), 
  and the residence buildings needed a card swipe on the scanner . 
  it also had a unique randomly generated `` candidate '' number on it which we entered into our exam sheets instead of our names to reduce bias in marking . 
  there 's no security border guards like you describe , there 's just automatic scanners . 
  most families have their own allegiances to different brands , just as many do with their technology , cars , furniture etc. 
  we 're pretty die-hard yorkshire tea fans , it goes well with our hard water in norfolk , though my aunt prefers twinings . 
  can you help me try to understand it ? 
  i 'm keen to learn a perspective i have n't considered , but i really can not see much of a situational difference between the claims of the name `` ireland '' and the claims of the name `` macedonia '' . 
  hell , the republic of ireland was even worse because not only do they simply call themselves `` ireland '' officially , but they also once really did claim the entire territory of the island of ireland , although they do n't now . 
  after all that , we are still perfectly fine with it and have good relations . 
  the uk does n't demand that they call themselves the `` republic of southern ireland '' , and we were courteous enough to rename the uk-controlled province as northern ireland . 
  the greeks are n't so keen on renaming their province `` southern macedonia '' . 
  there are problems with macedonian nationalism , i 'm aware of that , but on this specific naming issue the republic of macedonia is on the right side . 
  if greece is using it as a proxy for the wider macedonian cultural issue , it 's very counter-productive . 
  i call it the `` republic of macedonia '' , or the `` macedonian republic '' . 
  i consider `` macedonia '' to mean the historical region which can be broadly approximated to be composed of the greek province of macedonia , the republic of macedonia , and blagoevgrad province in bulgaria . 
  we have an analogous issue with the use of the name `` ireland '' . 
  british people resolve this by specifically referring to the country as the `` republic of ireland '' , even though that 's technically not the name of the country . 
  why the greeks are so insistent to drag out the issue when there 's already a precedent that solves it strikes me as ridiculous and juvenile . 
  for the record , it was music based , i was in a choir and i believe it was some kind of exchange with another choir . 
  i 've been to oslo , paris , florence , various places in greece and rome ( including the vatican ) as part of various school trips . 
  people in the uk does n't particularly care about constitutional federalism , it 's more about giving all people in the uk devolved assemblies with a symmetrical power structure . 
  i 've openly supported the idea years before the referendum . 
  at the very least the principle of symmetrical power should be applied , with nobody left behind . 
  i would think that catalonia would have catalan and spanish both as national languages , so not much would actually change in that respect . 
  we 're one of those countries that usually do n't mind wearing shoes indoors so long as they 're not wet or muddy , though different families have different rules about this . 
  i keep my nice shoes in my bedroom , and my boots/wellies/walking boots just inside the front and back doors . 
  montenegro , serbia , albania , macedonia , moldova . 
  canada , definitely . 
  like all the good bits about america with the bad bits removed . 
  also uk here . 
  not a name that rights a bell . 
  the dutch ? 
  the dutch are cool , they 've just got funny accents . 
  oh , i assumed that was a generalised term for stuff like overseas territories and the various non-sovereign associated entities of european states . 
  my mistake . 
  man , this stuff is far too complicated . 
  i consider `` european '' to be a primarily cultural concept instead of a strictly geographical one , and that owing to emigration , empire and cultural exchange , there are places outside europe which are still `` european '' . 
  for example , the falkland islands are by virtue of their history strictly adherent to its concept of the `` british identity '' , moreso than great britain itself . 
  it rules itself in a manner modelled on westminster , and as even subject to the european convention on human rights . 
  however , not all outermost regions are the same , and i could not confidently tar them all with the same brush . 
  it may well be that some outermost regions have culturally exchanged with nearby countries in a manner which has led them to no longer be considered a european people . 
  in addition , i think there is such a thing as a country being partially , or half-european , again because of cultural exchange .
