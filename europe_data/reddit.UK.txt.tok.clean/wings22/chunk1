yet , still does not make it better than this one, 
  sure , it 's not something i 'm about to petition my mp about . 
  but the discussion was `` the perfect plug '' , and the perfactist that i 've seen so far is the aus/nz one . 
  no this means that cameron would toe his party line and `` recommend '' a vote for leaving the eu . 
  i think it 's ok to have a referendum , and it 's ok for all the parties to speak their piece . 
  a couple of years after the next election ( so like 2017-2018 ) seems like a good time , hopefully everythings calmed down a bit and we can look at it sensibly during a time of `` normality '' rather than a kneejerk reaction which i feel a lot of the likes of ukips rhetoric is . 
  i live in the uk and it 's fucking massive , multi-gangs are house sized , having a double plug means redesigning your kitchen , and crippling landmines are left everywhere ... 
  they 're horrible . 
  the ones in the plug i showed are not weak at all . 
  given they are not iron building girders like the uk one , but more than strong enough and more sensible for a plug . 
  the perfect one is the [ / nz/australia ] ( http://blog.gowalkabouttravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/power-outlet-for-australia.jpg ) one . 
  the europe one is better than uk definitely , but i think even the us one is better than the europe one . 
  it 's too flimsy , 2 little prongs that rely on the wall socket for tension strength to stay in , it just does n't feel secure in the socket . 
  the one above pretty much always stays in when it 's moved about , put if you pull it straight out it comes out nicely . 
  it 's also got 3 strong plug bits for more reliability . 
  but yes , the uk one is the absolute worst . 
  i doubt anywhere is going to change now though , we 've got too much stuff . 
  i guess i assumed it was all about electricity and it 's different because it includes things like road and air transport , not the reason i originally thought . 
  as about 11 % of uk energy was renewable in 2012 , is the difference between that and the `` final energy consumption '' in your graph of what looks to be about 4-5 % due to renewable energy being wasted overnight ? 
  or is is another reason, 
  i think you should have just said this instead of making a personal attack on them, 
  yeah this is moronic . 
  a large faction of the public said their number 1 issue is the youth being unemployed at the moment , but he 's supposed to toe the 2006 line when the outlook was vastly different ? 
  yeah bit odd . 
  he took the stat for st louis `` city '' , which had a pop of 318k and 113 homicides . 
  but that makes it a `` rate '' of 35.5 for st louis city vs 1.2 for portugal . 
  i 'm responding to the comment that the eu flag should be everywhere , not suggesting they ca n't display it with other flags . 
  is n't that a bit selfish and disrespectful to the people of the rest of countries in the world that also fought in this war ? 
   a ( britain ) does not want b ( france ) to fly flag x ( eu flag ) . 
  no the article does not say that at all , they just do n't want them ( they informally requested ) to fly it more prominently than the flags of the member states that fought the war . 
  no , it 'd be like flying the union flag more prominently in scotland to commemorate a battle between the english and the scottish hundreds of years ago long before the union ... 
  there were many many nations around the world who fought and died in wwi , and to diminish them for the sake of a political entity established over 50 years later does seem at least a little bit crass . 
  note that the request was n't for the flag not to be flown ... just not to make the whole thing about the eu - which it should n't be . 
  by all means on the anniversary of the eu dye all the cows in 27 countries blue and gold , but this is not that day . 
  the telegraph are the ones telling you about it ... not the ones suggesting it, 
  i would at least try and comfort . 
  he just meant that the addition of screaming and unpleasantness in this video could unsettle even people that are desensitized to violence , as it hits harder . 
  my ballot just says `` putting england first ! '', 
  for the english democrats . 
  i 'm disappointed i miss out on all the rhetoric :(, 
  i disagree . 
  i may be pro-eu but the defacing of ukip posters is n't funny or rational , nor is just trying to mock and character assasinate , it just makes it seem like there is no rational argument against their points . 
  as a normal joe walking around and watching the news i have heard all the ukip points , but not really anything from the opponents . 
  the libdems just kind of seem to say `` it 's good to be in the eu cos trade '' . 
  if you do n't know better how can you be expected to vote better ? 
  pro-eu groups should throw up some posters with points about why it 's good to be in the eu . 
  educate the masses and get people talking about it . 
  talk to people about why it 's good , that 's what i do n't see . 
  honestly i 'm not going to sit down and watch a debate between farage and clegg - maybe you will but it 's not your vote that they need to get . 
  statistics show what you want them to show . 
  let 's look at an example from [ their results ] ( http://www.ipsos-mori.com/assets/docs/polls/ipsos-mori-rss-kings-perils-of-perception-topline.pdf ) : what percentage of the uk public do you think are single parents . 
  [ here 's the responses ] ( http://imgur.com/a3zngc7 ) so the majority said they did n't know ( this was the biggest answer to pretty much every single question ) . 
  the second largest group of people , said 1-10 % . 
  the true answer , at the bottom , is 3 % , so they were all correct . 
  it then says the mean of responses is 28 % , even though ~ 75 % of the people who answered the question , said below that answer . 
  seems like a pretty shitty way to present the data , when more than 50 % of the public said `` i do n't know '' or was exactly correct , they present it as `` the uk public think 28 % are single parents lol '' . 
  it 's much smaller and so you can have either cable way . 
  then people like you who like the down facing cables can have their cake and people like me who like small plugs that stay in the wall and do n't foot lay traps can also have cake . 
  you could have ones that go down [ like this ] ( http://www.leadsdirect.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/chinese-plug.jpg ) . . best of both worlds ? 
  in regards to the power plugs , i agree the uk one is shit . 
  but the european one is also shit , it always falls out of the wall or sits loosely . 
  the best is the one used in [ nz/aus/china ] ( http://blog.gowalkabouttravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/power-outlet-for-australia.jpg ) . 
  is n't obscenely massive and turn into foot-spikes when unplugged , and never falls out of the wall . 
  something a little bit different , an overgrown seemingly abandoned house in london in bloom , taken this morning on my way to work : http://imgur.com/41xj609, 
  was n't there an 86 % turnout or something ? 
  seems we are looking at different graphs/data . 
  thought we were discussing the graph posted here that compares walking & cycling in countries , not all modes of transport in cities . 
  ok but the point was that if a city/country has excellent public transport it will also score badly on op 's graph , along with a country that has no public transport . 
  so you mean where it says : which of these statements do you think best describes us healthcare today : * crisis 21 % * major problems 52 % * minor problems : 24 % * no problems : 1 % 73 % think its in crisis or has major problems . 
  i think it 's fair to say if you think a service has `` major problems or in crisis '' it 's not viewed favourably . 
  he/she just said a vast majority of americans think their current system is garbage , whereas your link asks whether they think the government should run it , which are very different questions . 
  example , i might think that the internet providers in my country are `` garbage '' , but that does n't necessarily mean i want the government to run it . 
  yeah they ship you home once/if you are stable and fit . 
  ehic only covers you for emergency healthcare . 
  just checked it 's called `` tores '' . 
  it 's in what seemed a little bit run down part of the town but that just added to the charm, 
  i visited vilnius a year or 2 ago on holiday . 
  was surprised how clean , cheap modern and pretty everything was . 
  the people were nice , and the women gorgeous . 
  visited this pub/restaurant up on the hill ( ca n't remember the name ) that had a view over the town , was really cool . 
  definitely would like to see more of the country . 
  ah , i thought we were talking about people who migrate by choice rather than refugees or asylum seekers . 
  other immigrants have no automatic right to public funds ( benefit , housing etc ) . 
  they do do this in the uk . 
  no , otherwise the government of country b wo n't bother making an effort to make sure that person gets a job , as they just rebill country a , who 's money is then getting spent in country b 's economy . 
  so the government is not allowed to send out letters warning that they will be deported if they do n't leave ? 
  in your view it should go from either legal to stay in the country to bam send in the heavies go go go, 
  why does germany get the football ? 
   do n't bother going to the beach i enjoyed my first ever trip to blackpool last year , though admittedly did n't really spend any time on the beach . 
  it was so surreal , like going through a timewarp and ending up in 80 's britain . 
  tourists can go round and round for hours of enjoyment at one of these , whereas at a junction they would just drive through , missing out . 
  tag you as `` sums up previous post in 1 sentence '', 
  i found your response very interesting , but wondering if it 's fair to count england without the other home nations of the uk . 
  i would have thought particularly when it came to the military and natural resources , but also r&d , england would be a fair bit worse off without them , or am i mistaken ? 
  is n't the problem they are having in spain now that because so many people are producing their own energy , a lot less people are now paying for the infrastructure of providing energy to homes/businesses ? 
  example , before you were paying $ 60 per month for your elecs . 
  this not only paid for the elec but transporting it to your home and maintenance and expansion of that grid . 
  now you pay maybe $ 5 , but still want to be connected to the grid for when your unreliable source does n't work ( nights/bad weather/winter ) . 
  now you are not contributing to the infrastructure but still expect to be serviced by it and expect it to be maintained so it 's there when you need it , and so you can sell your excess energy back to the grid . 
  it only briefly mentions it in that article but i imagine it 's a pretty big problem .
