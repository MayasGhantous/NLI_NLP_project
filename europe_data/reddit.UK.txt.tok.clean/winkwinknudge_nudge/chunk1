   we want , but do n't want to give . 
  we take part of , but we do n't commit . 
  why are you under the impression this is all without giving something to the eu ? 
  never . 
  opposition against the euro has only risen in the uk . 
  from 57 % opposed to it in 2005 to over 80 % in 2011 . 
  i 've actually gone the other way on things , though not quite to the extreme . 
  used to be quite pro-eu and the rest of it and now i 'm largely indifferent to it . 
  he 's not supported . 
  in 2012 what little support they had declined in the local elections . 
  they have no mps and in the eu 2014 election , nick griffin , their sole mep lost his place . 
  it varies .

  brothers laust and peter live in an innocent world full of hope , under poor , but happy , circumstances , in the danish countryside in the middle of the 19th century . 
  following the victories over the prussians in the war of 1848-51 , denmark is now scheming to annex schleswig into the danish kingdom . 
  inflamed with nationalism , the leader of the danish parliament , monrad , neglects all european treaties and throws the country into war with prussia . 
  at the same time , laust and peter grow up and fall in love with the well-read and beautiful inge , but when the war erupts peter and laust volunteer for the army ... 1864 is an epic , highly cinematic historical drama , in which we become eyewitnesses to momentous events and the extraordinary love story of peter , laust and inge , and how the brothers - along with thousands of danish soldiers - fought some of the bloodiest battles in european history . 
  1864 is made by miso film in co-operation with dr , is directed by ole bornedal and produced by jonas allen and peter bose . 
  if you 're using a comic on reddit to learn about other nations , you 're going to have a pretty warped perspective . 
   hate to say to no voters i told you so na you do n't . 
  that 's not a common misconception or stereotype about britain . 
  that 's just what * you * think . 
  now i remember why i have you tagged . 
   regardless , if true , he has a point . 
  scotland and ruk own the pound jointly . 
  and he 's right , it is a joint asset . 
  he 's not right when the uk govs position and backed by legal consultation is that a currency is n't an asset as so it should n't be shared . 
   that said , i 'm sure if there is a final ` yes ' vote then both countries will come to the negotiating table with cool heads and work out a sensible compromise . 
  i certainly hope there is n't a currency union as it 's not what the majority the uk want , nor the bank of england . 
  he quite plainly says it here when listing off different currency options - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vftfs_cfx28#t=142 not sure how you can remain sceptical ... 
   during monday night 's bbc referendum debate , scotland 's first minister alex salmond said : `` if you deny us the financial assets then the uk will get stuck with all the liabilities . '', 
  salmond has always referred to the pound as an asset . 
  in this context he 's saying exactly that . 
  there 's many sources on it . 
  http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/fm-rebuffs-demands-from-treasury-to-withdraw-his-threat-on-national-debt.1409496082 [ nobel economist : scots would be right to refuse to share uk debt if london wo n't share pound ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/nobel-economist-scots-would-be-right-to-refuse-to-share-uk-debt-if-london-w.1408948717 ) [ scotland could refuse to accept uk liabilities if currency union is blocked ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/26/scotland-share-uk-liabilities-currency-union-independence ), 
  besides the exact quotes from salmond and john swinney saying just that ? 
   finance secretary john swinney has confirmed scotland will not pay its share of the uk debt if it does not get a currency union after independence . 
  -  during monday night 's bbc referendum debate , scotland 's first minister alex salmond said : `` if you deny us the financial assets then the uk will get stuck with all the liabilities . '', 
  [ scottish independence : john swinney says ` no currency , no debt ' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-28943041 ), 
   it 's uk sovereign debt , not scottish sovereign debt . 
  scotland is under no obligation to take it on . 
  they 've said they 're willing to take on their share , if they get their share of boe assets as well . 
  no obligation but it sends a massive message to any would be investment about the stability of the economy if he 's willing to default . 
  it does n't instil one with confidence . 
  he 's specifically said he 'd only take the debt if he gets a currency union as he 's started to refer to it as an asset . 
   i 've also seen no evidence that people think this is the case . 
  really ? 
  when all yes voters/salmond insist there will be a currency union despite all parties , boe saying there would n't be and a majority of english and welsh population * not * wanting a currency union ? 
  sorry but dragging up something as recent as 1998 is laughable . 
   that collapse was n't inevitable nor unfixable , germany , japan and korea managed to maintain their industries , and the subsequent lack of investment is criminal . 
  all major economies have seen a change over the last 60 years from industrial to service based economies . 
  though you 're right there 's a lack of investment . 
   the british papers complain all the time about monetary policy not being used in the eurozone , but the uk has lived under a worse regime for decades without a peep . 
  oh right would n't want to miss an opportunity to knock the british press or the uk/eu relationship , eh ? 
  how predictable . 
   but the uk has lived under a worse regime for decades without a peep . 
  what ? 
  the north-south divide is something that 's quite apparent to most people in the uk . 
   in an evenly represented uk , no one would have agreed to making london the focal point of investment and making the rest feel like a scrounger nation . 
  london becoming a focal point was n't down to any sort of ` agreement ' like you say . 
  that 's entirely wrong and and to try and put a political spin on something as old as the hills is quite something to watch / u/delenda _ east . 
  it 's largely due to the collapse of heavy industry in the north and it moving abroad to developing nations . 
  you can even go back as far the industrial revolution when manchester had the greatest amount of millionaires in the uk . 
   that is simply not true , as i said and believe , there is no plan for any one to leave eu , no one know yet what will happen . 
  the president of the european commission , [ jose manuel barroso has said they 'd need to apply ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26215963 ) . 
  van rompuy also all but said they 'd need to apply . 
  that 's without even mentioning the exemptions scotland may want like from the euro , schengen which new states are required to agree to when they join the eu . 
   when talk of scottish independence began the english nearly universally said good riddance . 
  any ... actual facts to back that up ? 
   nice to see them all grovel now that the independence movement has gained traction and has a chance . 
  the english were so arrogant . 
  if you say so . 
  though i 've seen no groveling myself nor anything like it being reported in the papers . 
  groveling ? 
  sorry i did n't mean you downvoting directly . 
   but since there is no plan for any one leaving eu or how to get out ect . 
  saying they will leave if they vote yes is wrong , it 's pretty much been confirmed that scotland would need to request membership of the eu if they were to leave the uk . 
  boys/girls only schools are nothing new . 
  why are people here painting it as some barbaric forced gender segregation ? 
  wtf / r/europe ... wtf . 
  that 's not how it 's supposed to work ; you do n't downvote something because you disagree with it . 
  what have they said that 's false in the article ?

  google censor the eu specific flavours to be inline with the new law .

   8 ) ** united kingdom **  * pct . 
  population with tertiary education : 41.0 %  * average annual growth rate ( 2000-2011 ) : 4.0 ( 11th highest )  * tertiary education spending per student : $ 14,222 ( 16th highest )  while many national economies , including the united states , grew between 2008 and 2012 , the united kingdom 's economy shrunk over that time . 
  despite the downturn , public education spending as a percentage of gdp increased in the country more than any oecd nation over the same period . 
  the united kingdom is one of just a few countries with a `` sustainable approach to higher education financing , '' according to schleicher .
