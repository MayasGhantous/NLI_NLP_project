   the scottish parliament has no jurisdiction over the uk government . 
  and it would n't if it became independent . 
  how 's that anything to do with independence that ca n't be done currently ? 
  did n't the scottish gov already give it legal status about 10 years ago ( [ gaelic language \\ ( scotland \\ ) act 2005 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaelic_language_\\ ( scotland \\ ) _ act_2005 ) ) ? 
   maybe independence could help it . 
  how ? 
   they would n't be in business if they were n't effective . 
  well they 've had to change their name 2-3 times because they have such a bad reputation surrounding them . 
  they 're toxic and i 'm not sure how disciplined they can be when they 've killed many unarmed civilians in the past . 
  the us saying they were n't going to work with them any more , but then the cia giving them $ 100m contracts probably helps to keep the lights on as well , 
  blackwater are nothing more than cowboys who have a tendency at killing civilians . 
  yeah , a great group to have around . 
  that 's a pretty cavalier attitude to have concerning blackwater ( aka : academi , xe services ) considering the reputation they have . 
  shooting [ groups of civilians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blackwater_baghdad_shootings ) , bribery amongst many of the things they 've done . 
   fuck yea , i am so proud that those guys are there !, 
  ugh ... `` dark reputation '' ? 
  they 're disgusting . 
  does n't take into account beards . 
  you 're referring to the ` pro-britain ' item that received a paltry ** 25 upvotes and 22 downvotes ** with the top comment being `` source : gypsy palm reader '' i mean a 10 year-old documentary someone felt was somehow relevant and submitted to / r/europe about the uk clearing the chagos islands nearly beat it . 
  probably not a great comparison to this ` anti-britain ' item with ** 742upvotes 202 downvotes ** . 
  is that it really going both ways ? 
  because the us acting in it 's own self-interest is just completely unthinkable , right ? 
   let russia/china annex whoever , does n't really matter much to us . 
  surely the us repositioning its assets to the pacific to watch over china would prove otherwise ? 
  i never said there * was * anything insulting there . 
  i do n't mind ribbing or constructive comments on why it ca n't be but , the equivalent of `` hahaha '' is just lost on me . 
  not at all . 
  the last time something similar was posted - ( [ uk could be europe 's ` largest ' economy by 2030 thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1tqf13/bbc_uk_could_be_europes_largest_economy_by_2030/ ) ) the comments were filled with the exact same stuff . 
  it 's generally proven that any positive news about the uk in / r/europe is either downvoted into oblivion or filled with comments ridiculing the news . 
  url is broken . 
  you 've pasted it twice inline . 
  your views to seem very americanised so you 'd probably fit in well there . 
  i do n't think you 're going to find what you 're looking for in the eu , or canada . 
  maybe in the us if you 're in one of their pre-designated free speech cages . 
  yup . 
  do n't know why people are shocked by this . 
  he was pretty much a product of his time . 
  i think the fact you 're quick to call the uk a ` shithole ' and ca n't wait to get out without knowing ** anything about free speech in other parts of the eu ** show just how serious you are about ** probably ** moving ** `` in a few years '' ** . 
  it 's fine though just keep post your angry comments on reddit . 
  i 'm all for a constructive chat but you seem ... out there . 
   he was locked in a cage against his will . 
  ignore this reality like most do so it makes it easier to justify all you want . 
  i think i 'll ignore this thread . 
  have fun , 
   using state violence and force for its own moral views are you crazy ? 
  the police asked him to move on and he refused . 
  ah right no rush to leave this ` shithole ' then , just yet . 
  guess you thought your comments would go down better in / r/europe after pretty much everyone disagreed with what you were saying in / r/unitedkingdom and were downvoted ? 
   if only we had a few more `` american style libertarians '' we would n't have such a pathetic state of `` free speech '' in this country with people being arrested for jokes on twitter and facebook . 
  good one . 
   if the repercussions are jail , then yes that 's exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  if you are locked up for speech its the exact opposite of free . 
  yeah . . do n't think you really understand the concept of free speech . 
  and which eu countries would those be specifically ? 
   he was detained after failing to comply with a request by police to move on under the powers of a dispersal order . 
   he was further arrested on suspicion of religious or racial harassment . 
  free speech as responsibilities with it of course . 
  sorry but for whatever reason people seem the ignore that free speech has responsibilities and does n't give people the right to say what they like , to the who they like without repercussions . 
  i mean both the universal declaration of human rights and the eu say this too . 
   the exercise of these freedoms , since it carries with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society ... people complained about him spouting his racist drivel , the police asked him to move on and he refused . 
  i know it 's very edge to say things like everyone here loves the state and you ca n't wait to get out of this shithole but it 's a little silly . 
  which eu country are you thinking of moving to which allows you to stand on a street corner , refuse to move when the police ask you to and shout racist rants from ? 
  i 'd be curious to know who allow that . 
  were n't you guy the complaining about the guy being arrested for racially abusing a woman on a train ? 
  edit : yeah you [ were ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1oui8t/man_arrested_over_racist_tube_train_rant/ccvr16x ), 
  ignore the fact the police asked him to move on and he refused then ... that 's cool too . 
  in terms of values it 's a bit of a mixed bag . 
  there 's a large poll which compared western european countries values with the us - http://imgur.com/a/etovk, 
  it 's not nationalism i just wondered why there are two standards here . 
  i mean yesterday you [ said ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/23zbvd/how_are_the_british_viewed_in_europe/ch27fsp ) :  second , spying on literally everyone together is not the same as sharing information with each other . 
  but here we have norway investing in more computing power rather than continuing sending it * all * to the nsa so they can be capable of * `` decrypting & analyzing mass surveillance data '' * something you said was ` borderline treason ' for the uk to be doing . 
  if you want to dismiss my question as nationalism rather than give me an answer i guess you can do that . 
  nope i do n't believe so . 
  just thought i 'd try and post something positive about the uk and manufacturing in here for a change . 
  shh ... did you not hear ? 
  the uk is solely about banking now !, 
  ignore the [ fact ] ( http://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2014/04/optimism-among-manufacturers-sees-fastest-rise-since-the-early-70s-cbi-survey/ ) that [ manufacturing ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/uk-manufacturing-demand-exports-employment-pmi ) is rising ... we 're all bankers apparently . 
  yea it 's been [ posted in / r/europe - 78 upvotes 51 downvotes ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1tqf13/bbc_uk_could_be_europes_largest_economy_by_2030/ ) before but the comments were filled with people falling over themselves laughing and a general ` when pigs fly ' sentiment . 
   some of it is acceptable , some of it is n't . 
  and yet the uk is `` selling people out '' as you said but when the eu does it it 's ` cooperation ' ? 
  ah double standards , eh ? 
   the others are not , you 're right they 're part of the ** nine eyes ** group . 
  and of course i 'm sure the uk is the only one who has done that . 
  denmark are already part of the nine eyes spy group . 
  [ denmark is one of the nsa 's ' 9-eyes ' ] ( http://cphpost.dk/news/denmark-is-one-of-the-nsas-9-eyes.7611.html ), 
  and just yesterday i was talking to people in / r/europe who were defending what europe 's spy agencies were doing while calling what the uk does as ` borderline treason ' . 
  yup i read that so i 'm just wondering where you 've seen that people on the train were fine with it as it contradicts his view . 
  i 'd hope it 's not the heavily compressed footage of football fans cheering from one carriage . 
  it 's been like that for sometime with the us 's patriot act . 
  [ microsoft admitted this back in 2011 ] ( http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/microsoft-admits-patriot-act-can-access-eu-based-cloud-data/11225 ) . 
   * can microsoft guarantee that eu-stored data , held in eu based datacenters , will not leave the european economic area under any circumstances -- even under a request by the patriot act ? 
  * --  frazer explained that , as microsoft is a u.s.-headquartered company , it has to comply with local laws ( the united states , as well as any other location where one of its subsidiary companies is based ) . 
   though he said that `` customers would be informed wherever possible , '' he could not provide a guarantee that they would be informed -- if a gagging order , injunction or u.s. national security letter permits it . 
   any data which is housed , stored or processed by a company , which is a u.s. based company or is wholly owned by a u.s. parent company , is vulnerable to interception and inspection by u.s. authorities . 
   but when it pulled into the telford station and the announcement was made everyone looked at each other in disbelief . 
   there was some nervous laughter but not because it was funny but because people could not believe he had said that . 
  from your linked article . 
  and how do you think you 're going to ` get rid of the uk ' ? 
  * edit * : nevermind i 've read your [ past comments ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22p1s9/would_you_welcome_canada_in_the_european_union_as/cgpp2hm ) like :  yes , and there 's a decent case the uk is n't culturally european . 
  i hope they have their referendum soon and leave .
