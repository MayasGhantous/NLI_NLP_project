  i do n't think it would be sass more likely on how self-conceited it is . 
  considering most of big internet companies are in the us it leads me to believe they needed little help getting data . 
  first the argument was `` oh five eyes . . grr us and uk '' then `` oh well eu agencies are solely sharing information on just the bad guys '' and now it 's `` oh but they 're not doing it on the same scale '' ? 
  like i said earlier it seems a tad hypocritical when ** we 've no idea what information eu agencies are sharing ** . 
  always entertaining to see / r/europe try and put the whole spying thing solely on the us/uk and have selective memory with regards to the eu 's actions . 
  also worth noting from your linked article :  he added : `` effective cctv schemes are an invaluable source of crime detection and evidence for the police . 
  for example , in 2009 95 per cent of scotland yard murder cases used cctv footage as evidence . '' and a huge majority of those cameras ( 80 % from the last survey ) were privately owned . 
  then why 's he trying to differentiate between what he ** thinks ** the eu is doing vs that of the uk ? 
  it seems like the existence of nine eyes and eu agencies belonging to it was news to him so maybe he 's just not up to speed . 
   yes we are a surveillance state , * there are cameras on every street * , straight away that 's just not true . 
  i 'm aware of the cctv figures but that statement is just not true in the slightest . 
   when the guardian told everyone what was going on clegg and cameron got thugs to destroy the hard drives ... [ again not true ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/20/guardian-editor-alan-rusbridger-nsa ) . 
  the guardian were threatened with legal action and they chose to destroy the files rather than handing the files over . 
  and how do you know the eu agencies were solely focused on terrorist organisations ? 
  i did find it funny you were so quick to throw out five eyes as an inherently bad thing and then when there 's a larger tier like nine eyes with many eu agencies in it 's `` oh they 're just sharing information on terrorists '' . 
  it 's the [ guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/02/nsa-portrait-total-surveillance ) . 
  so eu agencies get a pass because they 're just ` sharing information ' between each other . 
  what information do you actually think the eu agencies are sharing ? 
  when uk does it they 're simply a lapdog of the us and are committing borderline treason . 
  yeah , nothing hypocritical there at all . 
  oh you and your wit . 
  nope try nine eyes . 
   ... the nsa has other coalitions , although intelligence-sharing is more restricted for the additional partners : the 9-eyes , which adds denmark , france , the netherlands and norway ; the 14-eyes , including germany , belgium , italy , spain and sweden ; and 41-eyes , adding in others in the allied coalition in afghanistan . 
   the exclusivity of the various coalitions grates with some , such as germany , which is using the present controversy to seek an upgrade . 
  germany has long protested at its exclusion , not just from the elite 5-eyes but even from 9-eyes . 
  minutes from the uk intelligence agency gchq note : `` the nsa 's relationship with the french was not as advanced as gchq 's ... the germans were a little grumpy at not being invited to join the 9-eyes group '' . 
  edit : source ( [ guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/02/nsa-portrait-total-surveillance ) ) added also in later comments too . 
  you must have missed the memo where many european agencies were also complicit in the whole spying thing . 
   nostalgic for their former empire how so ? 
   left-hand traffic what incentive is there to change ? 
   also rather focused on usa ( and taking their bad habits  ) and commonwealth than europe ( except the scottish ) it 's fairly common to have closer ties to countries which speak the same language . 
  i know people like to equate that to being the 51st state of the us or a lapdog . 
   silently becoming a surveillance state lol sure . 
  spot on . 
  did n't expect much being positive from the thread tbh and seems i was right in my expectations . 
  you missed out lapdog of the us/51st state/hoping the empire comes back/ugly people/women , though . 
  those seem fairly common on here too . 
  you really think the us would reduce the size of its military by any significant measure ? 
  i personally ca n't ever see that happening . 
   and i 'd rather see my tax money go to education and health care instead of bombs and guns . 
  the eu really is n't stopping you there . 
  there 's plenty the us could already do with better military spending rather than throwing millions/billions at flawed projects which do n't amount to much . 
  you have tf-east . 
  seems silly not to use it . 
  and of course bases in many , many bases already in the region to begin with . 
  i do n't know why you try to make it as though the us is being pulled into anything here begrudgingly . 
  it would n't * need * to change . 
  i 've no problem with it at all . 
  no need to be hostile :-) i just found it funny you feigning surprise at the report when you 've posted this and many things like it before . 
  really ? 
  you 're pretty regular at posting islam related stories in / r/europe . 
  and a documentary can decide what 's criminal now ? 
  / u/magadget is on a bit of a roll today . 
  first dredging up news from november about the uk burning government documents in the 1960 's and now a ten year old documentary about something which happened nearly 50 years ago . 
  completely ignore the fact that the uk has made several attempts at looking into resettling people there once in 2003 and it was deemed too costly and sea levels were rising at twice the global rate . 
  uk experts and the foreign office are currently undertaking another feasibility study right now into how realistic and possible it would be for people to be resettled there with the likes of self-sustainability and cost . 
  # i look forward to seeing documentaries about some of the less great things other eu nations have done being posted here but for whatever reason i ca n't see that happening :-) if and when the uk does leave / r/europe this subreddit will be a little quieter for sure . 
  and what crime would that be in this instance ? 
  no you 're right you did n't say * all * you did say ** most ** . 
  that 's much better . 
  if you 're going to make a sweeping generalisation like you did at least have a modicum of fact to back it up , other than `` i 've met a number '' . 
  it does n't give me much confidence that , that view is widely held . 
  ah , so just anecdotal stuff then ? 
  right . 
   many ( most ? ), 
  brits still refuse to believe that they 're benefiting off the past , and refuse to acknowledge their countries brutal history . 
  and what draws you to that staggering generalisation ? 
  i do find it interesting you put the treatment of the aborigines by australians in a past tense though . 
  sorry but the comparison of violent crime against the uk is a well known fallacy . 
  been through it many times with many americans . 
  ` news ' from november 2013 . 
  oh / r/europe . 
  governments destroy or remove internal documents so new governments do n't get them . 
  is this a surprise ? 
  lovely comments on that news story though . 
   a once childhood paradise of nostalgia and tight-knit community has turned into a sharia-zone yup . 
  keep reading that daily mail or with lines like that you could probably land yourself a job there . 
  just fairly used to similar comments on here regarding the uk . 
  why ? 
  because of david cameron 's religious beliefs ? 
  not really . 
  the headline is n't anything like what cameron said which was :  `` jesus invented the big society 2,000 years ago , '' mr cameron said . 
  `` i just want to see more of it . '' and this was said at an easter reception . 
  religion at an easter reception ? 
  i 've not read the full report yet but the bbc article does n't make a single mention of romanians or bulgarians . 
  he suggests italy should be in the eu with regard to corruption ... they 're not great . 
  there 's a poll which shows how/if people are affected by corruption in the eu . 
  http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/72724000/gif/_72724992_eu_corruption_labels_624map ( 3 ) . gif european anti-corruption report :  in the united kingdom , petty corruption does not appear to pose a challenge . 
  moreover , the uk has made strides in encouraging its companies to refrain from bribing officials abroad , through stringent legislation and detailed guidelines . 
  traditionally , the uk promotes high ethical standards of public service . 
  however , to ensure continued success , further efforts are necessary to address risks of foreign bribery in vulnerable industries such as defence . 
  in this report , the european commission suggests that the uk should ensure transparency in out-of-court settlements in corruption cases . 
  accountability in the governance of banks can also be further strengthened . 
  the commission is also suggesting to cap donations to political parties , impose limits on electoral campaign spending and ensure proactive monitoring and prosecution of potential violations . 
  it says exactly that in the article :  `` but it cautions that the recovery has been unbalanced , with business investment and exports still disappointing . '', 
  so did you just forget france 's support or did you purposely exclude them ? 
  cares could not be given . 
  i find it pretty sad you 've nothing better to do with your time than post this nonsense though . 
   this is the reason why every socket has a switch - so you do n't fry yourself while plugging in/unplugging . 
  you mean like the british ones ?
