   but the british model is used by two countries , `` according to the iec it is also used in over 50 countries worldwide , many of which have national standards based on bs 1363 , including : ireland , malaysia , singapore , and saudi arabia . '', 
  '' according to the iec some 40 countries use type d and 15 countries use type m. some , such as india and south africa , use standards based on bs 546 . '', 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ac_power_plugs_and_sockets#british_and_compatible_standards ) sure ... two countries ... 
  why do you say british ones are unsafe and then include a picture of a swiss type j ( swiss sev 1011 ) ? 
   england 's green lands are very artificial and that does n't only apply to cities . 
  artificial in what way ? 
  if you 're complaining about obesity then you probably wo n't want to retire in spain or greece . 
   having lived in london and now near it i miss nature and forest etc so much . 
  yeah ... you generally do n't get much of those things in a city . 
  also stats for obese/overweight ( via bmi ) men between the uk and poland are fairly close - http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/4/46/overweight_and_obesity_-_men.png, 
  not really . 
  a minor debate between two of the smallest ` mainstream ' parties ( is ukip even that ) ? 
  there 's also a fair amount of euroscepticism in the likes of france , germany , italy and many others . 
  good luck though . 
  i just find your fear of ukip and hatred of the british isles and its people to be a little misguided . 
  ukip with their record breaking of 0 mp 's in the house of commons are hardly a threat . 
   but yeah , if they 're nearly as euroskeptic as the english are , then i do n't think it sounds like a country for me , based on what you said there . 
   i think you should stop reading the red tops , 
  not entirely sure and i guess it 's still early days so it could all change but i 've included a [ quote ] ( http://www.dw.de/telekom-hopes-to-stave-off-nsa-snoops-by-keeping-internet-traffic-in-germany/a-17154274 ) from thomas kremer of telekom . 
   `` in a next step , this initiative could be expanded to the schengen area , '' kremer said , referring to the 26 eu countries - excluding britain - that have abandoned controls on land borders . 
  looks like there could be some flexibility there . 
  nope . 
  it 's already been said it 's only for countries who 're signed to the schengen agreement so the uk 's excluded . 
  there 's a somewhat interesting article on it - [ weighing a schengen zone for europe 's internet data ] ( http://www.dw.de/weighing-a-schengen-zone-for-europes-internet-data/a-17443482 ), 
  tizard mission . 
  henry tizard and a delegation of scientists and representatives from the army , navy and air force , went to the us with a brief case loaded full of blueprints , diagrams and research for things like the jet engine , nuclear bomb . 
   inside lay nothing less than all britain 's military secrets . 
  there were blueprints and circuit diagrams for rockets , explosives , superchargers , gyroscopic gunsights , submarine detection devices , self-sealing fuel tanks , and even the germs of ideas that would lead to the jet engine and the atomic bomb . 
   but the greatest treasure of all was the prototype of a piece of hardware called a cavity magnetron , which had been invented a few months earlier by two scientists in birmingham . 
   john randall and harry boot had invented the cavity magnetron almost by accident . 
   it was a valve that could spit out pulses of microwave radio energy on a wavelength of 10cm . 
  this was unheard of . 
  nothing like it had been invented before . 
  [ bbc ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6331897.stm ) & [ tizard mission wiki page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tizard_mission ), 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galileo_ ( satellite_navigation ) #tension _ with_the_united_states  at first , eu officials did not want to change their original plans for galileo , but have since reached a compromise , that galileo was to use a different frequency . 
  this allowed the blocking or jamming of either gnss system without affecting the other ( jam galileo without affecting gps , or jam gps but not galileo ) , giving the us a greater advantage in conflicts in which it has the electronic warfare upper hand . 
  though there 's a [ longer paper ] ( http://citation.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/7/2/1/4/pages72145/p72145-1.php ) i 've not read . 
  also a few older articles on it regarding the us 's opposition . 
  [ europe 's new air war ] ( http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/10.08/airwar_pr.html ) [ us warns against european satellite system ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1718125.stm ), 
  i think they just moved frequency so gps could be blocked and galileo would n't and vice versa . 
  that and britain was forced to give away most of their great ideas for us support . 
  i think that 's worth a mention . 
  and giving war criminals pardons in return for their research and technology probably helped a bit  in terms of r&d the us greatly benefited from ww2 . 
  reminds me of the time the us objected to esa 's gps equivalent galileo because they could n't control it . 
  ah , that makes much more sense . 
  thanks . 
  you mean barnaby bear ? 
  the kids tv show which has n't been made for probably 10 years ? 
  the whole thing is really a non-story . 
  those sort of imported shows belong on bbc four and it seems like a proper place for them . 
  as the article says the bbc creates many shows and i think it 's good to have a balance . 
  cameron is just out of his depth comparing it to that of the us . 
  the office had two writers ( gervais and merchant ) compared to that of modern family which has 24 writers . 
  people forget germany wanted to join the five eyes club , 
  article shows nothing new but is techdirt 's typical rehashing of news which was posted on der spiegel and the intercept last week . 
  mind its own business ? 
  you mean like the us * choosing * to move many assets to the pacific to try and put pressure on china or you know that whole war against terrorism thing ... oh , diddums . 
   a british expert team considered the recovery of the bodies impossible due to the lack of space in the cave system at that depth . 
  the finnish team decided to recover the bodies themselves despite the fact that the norwegian government closed the caves from diving and deemed the rescue attempt too dangerous . 
  --  ** `` it is simply too dangerous . 
  it is not worth risking your life to accomplish this task , '' \\* * mark dougherty , the british cave diver who led the rescue efforts told a press conference on february 25 . 
  dougherty led the team which brought up the body of a norwegian man who died in the caves back in 2006 . 
  ignore the fact it 's entirely two different things to running a professional recovery with authorities and an * illegal * one where individuals can take more risks that authorities would deem too great , nor anyone ** hired ** for the job would . 
  that 's cool too ... 
  [ sam leith : do n't fall for the latest sharia law scare story ] ( http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/sam-leith-dont-fall-for-the-latest-sharia-law-scare-story-9212073.html ) - standard.co.uk, 
   how can you or anyone apologize this kind of behavior ? 
  how are those people still here and free to roam around europe ? 
  i 've not seen anyone apologising for him . 
  radical forms of any religion are unacceptable which is why the government is intervening . . as it says in the title but you seem to have ignored that . 
   one of these days , you 're going to become a victim of something truly heinous . 
  you have shown me the light and the error in my ways !, 
  err ... na . . you 're not going to win people over to ` your side ' with an opening line like that . 
  all the best though !, 
  i 'm not at all offended . 
  trolling adds nothing to the conversation and is against reddiquette . 
  calm you faux outrage . 
  thanks for confirming you an agenda against muslims though . 
  your post about swedish immigration with a video from ... 2011 yesterday did make me wonder . 
  worst than a troll is a poor/lazy troll . 
  you posted that same image in this subreddit a few days ago . 
   as if giving tea and biscuits clears anyone from serious wrongdoings . 
  i talking in general terms . 
  a mosque offered edl members them and though it 's not related to this story i just ca n't imagine you posting a positive story about a mosque , 
   unbelievable that this happens and nothing is done about it , most likely out of fear . 
  you mean apart from the government intervening ? 
   in fact , it 's been reported by undercover journalists that hate speech and even terror workshops are held regularly ... 
  it 's also been reported * that one mosque a while ago * offered tea , biscuits and football to people . 
  probably wo n't see that posted on here though . 
  edit : * clarity . 
  and ? 
   but if many people start telling you , as a nation , that this is true , then maybe there something that should be changed ? 
  you mean when polls have shown that this is n't the case ? 
  most britons do n't think they are culturally superior ( 32 % ) . 
  you say britain has a problem but the german 's who * actually * think they 're superior with 47 % agreeing and you say `` germans do not '' have this problem . 
  i just find your reasoning odd is all . 
   do n't actually quote me on this , but it was definitely along the lines of `` we 're superior to them , so we should n't make any changes - they should '' ) . 
  now whatever your personal opinion of blair may be , he was elected by your people . 
  i find odd though because [ there 's a poll ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/11/17/the-american-western-european-values-gap/ ) which show the opposite to be true :  germans ( 47 % ) agree with the statement , * `` our people are not perfect , but our culture is superior to others ; '' * 44 % in spain share this view . 
  in britain and france , only about a third or fewer ( 32 % and 27 % , respectively ) think their culture is better than others . 
  so the idea of britain thinking itself is culturally superior to others does n't really align with a poll which i put more weight into .
