  technically speaking broadcom do n't make anything as they outsource fabrication . 
  obama also recently said there 's no country that they wo n't engage in espionage . 
  i ca n't imagine the uk benefiting from this in anyway when they 're not even allowed to join the network . 
  good for the rest of the eu though . 
   a defra spokesperson told channel 4 news : `` we are grateful for the support from the dutch government -- so far we have borrowed eight very high volume pumps and have several dutch engineers assisting us in somerset . 
  we will continue to discuss our needs with the netherlands and other eu partners . '', 
   most democratic , powerful and overall the best country in the world err , what country are you talking about there ? 
  pointless . 
  obama already said they can spy on who they like and a ` no-spy ' agreement does n't exist with any country . 
  techdirt are a pretty poor blog to being with . 
  they simply echo other sites and slap a sensationalist headline on it and add their own little blob of hyperbole to the story . 
  i mean the story in this example references the us constitution . 
  err , what ? 
  though a lot of this misinformation can often be seen in many comments . 
  just look at all the references to orwell , 1984 and censorship in this thread . 
  written by people from portugal , poland but no britons . 
  because you simply decided not to enable the filter ? 
   today we have no power over our own private data because we do n't have power over what us gov is doing . 
  people could just not use us based services but they 're everywhere and with few alternatives in the eu already established . 
  there is a choice but it 's a difficult one for people to leave facebook , twitter , google ... 
  though it 's already been said that the uk will be excluded from any sort of eu based network , so i guess that 's me out :-(, 
  existing customers will be prompted and asked if they want to enable the filter or continue as they are and new customers are asked if they want to opt-out when they signup . 
  can you not see there 's an anti-uk circlejerk in full swing here ? 
  logic nor fact need apply . 
  * insert trite orwell/1984 reference here . 
  an optional isp filter is n't surveillance nor is it even slightly orwellian . 
  how is this at all related to surveillance ? 
  btw :  maybe not only , but we all can agree that uk takes surveillance to the level that is unacceptable in other parts of eu ( even if `` yet unacceptable '' ) . 
  sweden allows all communications to be intercepted which cross borders without a warrant . 
  also interactive-ish - http://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/surface/level/orthographic=15.14,50.64,720, 
  i suppose it would be some sort of admission of wrongdoing and i honestly could n't see them being loaned back to the uk . 
  guess he has to try and get publicity for his film somehow . 
  the critics have n't been kind . 
  wow you even drag a little image around with you for such occasions ? 
  what 's with the editorialised title from the factually correct original title :  police will have ` backdoor ' access to health records despite opt-out , says mp the database is n't even live yet so how could they have possibly gained warrantless access to it ? 
  your title is poor . 
  from the 1993 book - * the god particle : if the universe is the answer , what is the question ? 
  * by leon m. lederman and dick teresi . 
   lederman explains in the book why he gave the higgs boson the nickname `` the god particle '' :   this boson is so central to the state of physics today , so crucial to our final understanding of the structure of matter , yet so elusive , that i have given it a nickname : the god particle . 
  ** why god particle ** ? 
  two reasons . 
  one , the publisher would n't let us call it the goddamn particle , though that might be a more appropriate title , given its villainous nature and the expense it is causing . 
  and two , there is a connection , of sorts , to another book , a much older one ... 
  and [ at the same time ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/01/chuck-hagel-us-foreign-policy-military-diplomacy ) saying america 's foreign policy has become too militarised and want more diplomacy . 
   `` foreign policy had become too militarised over the last decade or so , '' a senior us defence official said on condition of anonymity . 
  `` it 's time for us to be in a supporting role when it comes to the execution of this country 's foreign policy . '', 
  nope all . 
  it 's only fair . 
  i find it ridiculous that it 's allowed in this subreddit . 
  does n't exactly encourage a `` high level of debate '' . 
  read that as postsensationalist and it seemed much more fitting . 
  also the first paragraph completely contradicts your * knee-jerk induced * title . 
   uk media organizations have warned that ** if a government bill authorizing police to seize journalists ' notebooks , photos and digital files is passed monday ** , it could seriously endanger press freedom in the country . 
  has this bill in fact passed or are you jumping the gun ? 
  ca n't we have some sort of rule to prevent the editing of news posts on / r/europe ? 
  your [ last idea ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1mrmo4/british_spy_agency_gchq_hacked_belgian_telecoms/ccc5pii ) of :  `` i would say we stop importing stuff from the uk , but other than the bbc and a couple of car brands that no longer are in british hands i ca n't think of anything . '', 
  did n't work then ? 
   a gchq ( british ) program stores every single bit of data that moves through the country for 3 days to be sifted through . 
  a little incorrect . 
  the 3 days is a buffer and it 's no where near every bit , in fact anything valuable has been filtered out . 
  there would n't be the storage space available to capture it all . 
  the original quote was :  in essence , an internet buffer is a little like sky + , but on an almost unimaginably large scale . 
  gchq , assisted by the nsa , intercepts and collects a large fraction of internet traffic coming into and out of the uk . 
  this is then filtered to get rid of uninteresting content , and what remains is stored for a period of time -- three days for content and 30 days for metadata . 
  &  tempora allowed the agency to set up internet buffers so it could not simply watch the data live but also store it -- for three days in the case of content and 30 days for metadata .

  how is it `` classic british eu-bashing '' ?

   first blocking that foul internet pornography give it a rest already ... 
  hah `` let 's recap '' never one to miss an opportunity to rant against the uk then :p though you 've made some pretty false claims . 
   it started turning more racist / fascist or whatever , just plain hate all-around . 
  debate me all you want , but the amount of crude news about - insert random nationality here - coming out of the uk has surpassed any other country in europe in the past 3 years . 
  that , plus the attacks on the polish nationals and other shit . 
  * do n't read tabloids . 
  problem solved . 
   it 's instating state-run censorship under the guise of so-called `` think of the children '' as if porn was something unholy and un-natural never to be seen by anyone under 18 . 
  first it was porn , then apparently cartoons depicting porn is bad too , it 's also paedophilia - as if you can identify the age of a cartoon . 
  `` but she has small breasts !, 
  she must be under 18 ! '', 
  - yeah , that 's not sexist at all . 
  * state run ? 
  last time i checked its not . 
  it 's down to the isp 's to implement . 
  cartoons of porn banned ? 
  you 're being disingenuous there at the very least . 
  they banned cartoons depicting minors and this was in * 2009 * and even then it was a slight alteration from a law created in the 1970 's . 
   `` but she has small breasts !, 
  she must be under 18 ! '', 
  - yeah , that 's not sexist at all . 
  err who 's said that other than yourself ? 
  : /  it now started jailing people for shit they say on twitter . 
  * yea , the police have arrested people over silly things but they 've also arrested people who 've made death threats against people . 
  i assume you 're against them arresting people for death threats ? 
   is detaining journalists for loosely strung together reasons . 
  * which ** journalists ** are you referring to ? 
  while david miranda 's was silly , he is n't a journalist . 
  so who are the others ? 
   is blaming more and more of its problems on someone else . 
  crimes ? 
  it 's the immigrants .
