  economy ? 
  it 's europe . 
  lower standard of living ? 
  combine the two . 
  anything is to blame , any other ` outside ' force that makes everyone feel better , anything except what is really the problem , which i would be inclined to name as the government , the current party , the current prime minister and his gang of acolytes . 
  * again , do n't read the tabloids . 
   no worries , scotland is getting out of that mess apparently and maybe wales might get ideas too , then you 'll get to leave the eu and be in your own little corner with that single internet website called `` bringbacktheporn.co.uk '' and away from those horros such as the eu or immigration or gasp file-sharing . 
  * judging from the current polls that 's not going to happen , though it 's early days . 
  bring back the porn ? 
  just disable the filter . 
  easy . 
  immigration happens regardless of being in the eu . 
  filesharing is illegal in plenty of countries . 
  the eu even said a persons ' internet connection can be restricted if they 're committing illegal file sharing . 
  hope that helps to clear a few points of your rant up / u/onerichbastard :-), 
  the article is ripped from the * washington post * and it 's from ** 2008 ** . 
  [ original ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/28/ar2008042802560.html ) though i 'm not surprised from a site which uses `` britain sinking under unproductive muslims , costing # 13 + billion a year '' as an example of its articles ... edit : the washington post one also has an extra but small paragraph which has been removed :  samia el alaoui talibi , who with her husband ministers to muslims at a prison in northern france , talks to an inmate . 
  activists blame france 's social policies for the disproportionate number of muslims in its prison system . 
  ( by molly moore -- the washington post ), 
  1 , the olympics never get involved in politics . 
  they were hosted in china and they have a record of pretty poor human rights . 
  it 's pretty much against what the olympics are about to get involved in politics . 
  2 , snow can be quite easily artificially created as they 're doing in russia . 
  3 , russia put in the most compelling bid and won the only two other finalists austria and south korea . 
  south korea later winning the 2018 winter olympics . 
  did i leave anything unanswered for you ? 
  i did and you mentioned what a great infrastructure the us has for it and how it would be much better suited for it , though the us did n't even place a bid . 
  i do n't see how mentioning the us is at all relevant as it 's not like that was even an option . 
  olympics usually are massive investments and typically require a fair bit of infrastructure to be developed for it . 
  it 's partly good as it triggers massive investment in areas which are often neglected . 
  maybe you 'll have better luck at the 2026 winter olympics . 
  the us did n't bid for the 2014 winter olympics . 
  deal with it . 
  so you seem to be doing quite a bit of logic acrobatics to try say those companies are n't british . 
   be happy that you have the manufacturing capacity in the uk , do n't delude yourself . 
  by the way :  uk car production 2004 : 1,647,246 - the 1,500,000 units you are boasting about for 2012 are a decline of -9 % in the last 8 years . 
  i 'm boasting or being deluded ? 
  i never even mentioned car production numbers . 
  i remember watching a tv show where someone asked the same question , and the guy selling it said : `` it tastes a lot like human flesh '' . 
  i think they left pretty quickly . 
  already been pointed out several times before so i 'll just c&p my reply :  and your point is ? 
   oh to try and detract from uk manufacturing . 
   i remembered this is / r/europe . 
  must n't have anything positive about the uk here   they 're are british companies . 
  i do n't know how you can dispute that . 
  and your point is ? 
  oh to try and detract from uk manufacturing . 
  i remembered this is / r/europe . 
  must n't have anything positive about the uk here , 
  i think you 're mistaking ownership . 
  they 're still british and all have their headquarters in the uk along with manufacturing . 
  you do know that right ? 
  and also charities like the wellcome trust , the british heart foundation and arthritis uk . 
   `` locked inside our medical records is a mine of vital information that can help medical scientists make discoveries that can improve patient care and save lives , '' the british heart foundation 's medical director , professor peter weissberg , explained . 
  it 's disappointing to see the guardian trying to stir up outrage with their selective headline . 
  if you do n't like it then opt-out of it . 
  well that and they can massively reduce their tax bill in ireland with help from feargal o\u2019rourke . 
  that helps too . 
  i think a lot of it comes from the lack of trust and there 's really no way of the public being able to see the changes , if any that they implement . 
  i ca n't see them changing and giving it all up along with their industrial espionage gains . 
   today , the british monarch retains the right to ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water , but queen elizabeth ii only exercises her ownership on certain stretches of the thames and its surrounding tributaries . 
  this ownership is shared with the vintners ' and dyers ' companies , who were granted rights of ownership by the crown in the 15th century .

   `` i 've noticed that ~ ~ european ~ ~ politicians are very good at shifting the blame . '', 
  ftfy . 
  european politicians are hardly a unique breed . 
  it was something about how prejudiced europeans are . 
  and the us is a utopia or your own [ new york ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2530092/horror-hundreds-teens-terrorize-brooklyn-mall-attack-coordinated-social-media.html ) ? 
  do n't be silly . 
  every place has their share of idiots . 
  edit : [ bahhumbugger ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/bahhumbugger ) decided to delete their comment . 
   if you do business in a country , you must abide by their laws ; otherwise , do n't do business there . 
  heh tell that to [ google ] ( http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/tech_and_media/article1301908.ece ) . 
  though they eventually lost their [ appeal ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25763000 ) . 
  i take it that applies to every other european nation which has been found spying too ? 
  nice of you to give the uk a mention though . 
  merkel took notice when it was revealed * she * was being spied on . 
  she did n't really kick up a fuss when it was the general public . 
  snowden himself saying that germany was very much in bed with the us . 
  see http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1uwg2h/nadine_dorries_warns_of_a_tidal_wave_of/, 
  how 's that related ? 
  that 's a us thing . 
  you do know he had quite a bit of information on the uk 's intel operations ? 
  it most certainly in the uk 's interest . 
  how can he slap !, 
  / jk but seriously i agree . 
  ca n't see anything of a source on [ itar-tass ] ( http://en.itar-tass.com/search?query=scotland ) or much of anything from it on google news . 
  this does n't change anything with regards to youtube removing videos based on ip claims . 
  this merely moves drm from third party plugins to the browser . 
  i personally , do n't see it as being a big deal . 
  it 's just removing flash & silverlight drm and instead providing the apis for html and javascript to do it natively in the browser . 
  see [ arstechnica ] ( http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/05/drm-in-html5-is-a-victory-for-the-open-web-not-a-defeat/ ) for more pro argument and the [ eff ] ( https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/03/defend-open-web-keep-drm-out-w3c-standards ) against . 
  i 'm not sure on mozilla 's stance but someone [ did file a bug ] ( https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=923590 ) against implementing it, 
   apparently european seat belts decapitate people sometimes for some reason and they have n't fixed it because idk . 
  huh ? 
  i 've never heard that before . 
  isps have had filters available for years and to my knowledge no such list has ever been leaked . 
  my second point was this filter would introduce nothing new in terms of not interfering with traffic when it 's already commonplace for isps to do so . 
  that ship sailed long ago . 
  where is this list i hear so much about ?
