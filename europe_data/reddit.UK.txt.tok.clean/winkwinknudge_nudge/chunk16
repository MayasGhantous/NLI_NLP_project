  isps already interfere with connections with the likes of qos and traffic shaping . 
  proxies would n't help this . 
   i have seen recent pictures of entire terrorist convoys of 40 + cars going from uk to syria ... notice the description that says at least 15 cars , no where near 40 and the cars with aid clearly written on them ? 
  there 's similar groups with the same decals on their cars that run aid into syria and have [ facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/aidforsyriaconvoy ) pages and [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu-d47vyi0w ) [ videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahusqvdhpuw ) . 
  i 've seen the ones with ambulances interviewed on the news . 
  so where 's your evidence that these are terrorist convoys ? 
  damn you ukip !, 
  i 'm not really surprised it 's foxnews though . 
  probably did it to make the tea party seem a little less crazy and less alone . 
   building societies https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/building_society#current, 
  that would n't be illegal and nothing to do with david cameron as violent porn laws were introduced before he became pm . 
  he 's going after the depiction of rape in porn . 
  if you 're going to try and go for that angle of `` anti-porn england '' at least know a little about it . 
  also not sure why you turned it into that considering the op is about us borders ? 
  and yet the likes of this [ poll ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/11/17/the-american-western-european-values-gap/ ) the us ( 49 % ) , germany ( 47 % ) and spain ( 44 % ) all feel they 've atleast a superior culture when only 32 % of the uk do . 
  somehow casts a little doubt on your anecdotal claims . 
  are you sure it 's the uk and not belgium who think they 're superior if your having to bring up your feeling that the uk lacks double glazing or education ? 
   and no hatred for the uk at all , it 's a great country and i enjoyed it a lot , also have many friends there , and i still regularly visit !, 
  there are many great things to say about it . 
  hmm ...  [ well in the uk they call everything outside the uk shit . 
  you know whats funny about british girls/women ? 
  they are built for winter , but dressed for summer lived in the uk for 2 years , did my best to like it , but glad i left eventually . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/1nnpjh/belgian_solutions_not_every_solution_is_the/ccm8ooo ) yea , you really like the uk :d, 
   well , here you go : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_index[1] my nationality : belgian . 
  education is free . 
  pretty sure i would n't have ended up doing graduate studies in oxford if i was born in england , my parents would n't have been able to afford me the education that would get me in there ... err how 's that relevant ? 
  i never mentioned education . 
  another chance to have a bash at england i presume ? 
  do you have anything of substance to back that up other than anecdotal ? 
  clearly from your comment history you 've got some sort of hatred for the uk . 
  not sure how long it 'll last - http://vimeo.com/82666985, 
   you ca n't deny that britain still has this superiority ideology . 
  found this pretty pertinent and it 's quite easy to deny when you 've provided no evidence to support your claim - http://i.imgur.com/ovs6lfv.png . 
  i 'm more inclined to believe that poll and going from that germany and the us feel they 're superior . 
  it is optional . 
  i do n't know why you 're doubting that . 
  the main uproar over all of this is that it is * opt-out * rather than the reverse . 
  the filters have been offered by isps for years but they 're now opt-out . 
  that 's up to them but to say they wo n't be informed of the choice was wrong . 
  i do n't agree with the filter . 
  all customers will be notified that they can opt out . 
  this has been confirmed so your notion that people wo n't know is false . 
  the rest is a complete guess on your part and i do n't agree with it that some how it 's going to change how websites conduct themselves . 
  you can opt-out of it . 
  you 're really surprised reddit is on your isp 's list considering some of the subreddits ? 
   is my fucking country turning into a middle eastern dictatorship now or something ? 
  ** edit ** : why the downvotes ? 
  it 's hardly shocking that with its many porn subreddits it will be classified as porn by some isps ? 
  upvotes for hyperbole and bury responsible comments ? 
  oh / r/europe ... is there an alternative to this subreddit for proper discussions as it 's becoming more like / r/worldnews by the day . 
   besides the kind of content that is decided to be blocked answer is in your question . 
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_websites_blocked_in_china or try your own site and see if it 's blocked - http://www.greatfirewallofchina.org/ - you really ca n't just ignore what kind of content is blocked by either as there 's a pretty stark difference . 
  not ran by any arm of the government . 
  is ** optional ** . 
  i was n't mocking anyone and i 'm not sure how you 've come to that when the comment it was in reply to has been deleted . 
  but why would someone in a call centre have access to such a list ? 
  i just see people making a lot of assumptions on how any of it will be implemented . 
  a little context maybe ? 
  :  asked whether cameron believed the storage of personal data of citizens was necessary to catch terrorists , the spokesman said : `` neither the pm nor anyone in the government has commented on the details of how our intelligence agencies operate . '', 
   he added : `` the pm 's view on all this is unchanged . 
  the very important work that our agencies do is very important in keeping this country safe and the pm believes we should continue to support them with that . 
  alongside , we need a strong system of oversight and the pm believes we have that . '', 
  who 's applauding the gov here ? 
  why not tell us ? 
  but . . but ... reddit told me it 's orwellian 1984 , sharia law , britain going back to the victorian age ... :| edit : why not add a constructive comment rather than just downvoting things you disagree with ? 
  how does he arrive at this ? 
   as we know , lists do n't stay hidden . 
  i would imagine people do n't want to be on a list that is possibly accessible by anyone ( virgin media or not ) that says they 're into porn , right ? 
  i can imagine politicians , media personalities , church goers etc do n't want to be on the list , and thusly are blocked because of fear . 
  that 's an insane jump for our government . 
  the option for isp level adult filtering has been around for years and no such lists have leaked . 
  it would be destroy a company if it did . 
  and french and spanish . 
  related how ? 
  i was n't aware the victorians had optional porn filtering on their internet connections . 
  welcome to / r/europe where the likes of sweden , france , germany , and spain spy but uk gets the flak . 
  - http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10421835/germany-france-and-spain-were-all-spying-on-citizens.html somebody has to be the villain i guess ? 
  it 's cool . 
  i can see from your comment history you 're just a troll account . 
  thanks for playing though !, 
  that 's some revisionist history . 
  i know that uk were involved in destroying libyan anti-air from the submarine hms triumph . 
  i find it odd you some how just discount the efforts of many countries including france who conducted the most air strikes . 
   considering european powers ran into significant challenges fighting an enemy the us disarmed goes to show europe is nowhere near the level of capability necessary to secure its own concerns . 
  why would they still be fighting if they were disarmed by the us ? 
  too true . 
  the amount of misinformation/disinformation that 's been knocking around reddit on stories related to it are staggering . 
  everything from `` no porn for uk , they 'll riot over it '' to a conspiracy theory of the gov releasing lists of people who watch porn . 
  actual title :  ** certivox confirms it withdrew privatesky after gchq issued warrant **, 
  he never said it was only american celebrities ... 
  i 'd imagine celebrities from many countries do . 
  they 've not banned protests . 
  they 've banned occupational protests from campus and buildings which are n't authorised by the university . 
  not sure why people on here think it seems ok to disrupt the learning of others who 've paid quite a bit of money . 
  8 confirmed dead . 
  you can still read their 2010 manifestos hosted on their own sites . 
  hardly 1984 . 
  how was what i said a joke ? 
  thanks for the adult conversation ... 
  guess it 's easier to try and make a joke than make a constructive point ?
