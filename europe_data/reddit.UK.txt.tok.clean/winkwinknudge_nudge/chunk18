  a better outlining of the act is here - http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2013/april/copyright-law-reforms-in-pipeline-after-royal-assent-given-to-enterprise-and-regulatory-reform-bill/ and for the actual bill - http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/enterpriseandregulatoryreform.html, 
   scotland is incredibly pro eu . 
  no it 's not . 
  last poll had 59 % voting to remain if there was an eu vote . 
  that 's not ` incredibly pro eu ' . 
   that 's what we pro indy folk were saying all along . 
  it was was one word for scotland and the uk , and another for the uk and the eu . 
  it 's * almost * like they 're two different unions ... 
   wow ... out of 6 tidal powerplants ? 
  is n't that slightly too optimistic estimation ? 
  well we all ca n't be like poland and generate some 90 % of our power from coal while threatening to veto eu climate laws . 
   sure , we just never hear about it except in apologist responses . 
  `` but they do it too ! '', 
  is n't a valid argument in the first place . 
  so they follow a similar line of your own argument `` but continental spy agencies are n't in five eyes '' then ? 
  seems a tad rich to refer to the uk as a neighbour and then disparagingly call it as the ' 51st state ' or a trojan horse of the us . 
  they showed it on bbc four last night - [ iplayer link ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b054v0v2/storyville-20142015-17-the-great-european-disaster-movie ) . 
  financial times gave it 4/5 . 
  i liked it . 
   maybe it 's because you have a chip on your shoulder regarding my comments . 
  / u/zoorope sigh ... do n't you have anything better to do ? 
   funny , i thought that was you . 
  / u/zoorope i rarely comment about romanians . 
  you 're mistaken but you seem to have a chip on your shoulder regarding the uk . 
  seems you and / u/daswareinbefehl would get along well . 
   do n't take `` every '' literally though , because i think there are a couple of exceptions . 
  the uk , 
  not really . 
  it 's weighted to make representative of the entire uk . 
  https://yougov.co.uk/about/panel-methodology/ they have a fairly good record of being accurate - http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/vpn9i9ldc8/yougov-record-2014.pdf,

  ` they ' ? 
  the last time i checked romania was in europe and only spends 1.3 % on defense . 
  perhaps ` they ' should care a little more ?

  40 % wanting to leave is n't a vocal minority when 40 % also want to stay . 
  edit : downvoted really ? 
  look at the polls ... 
   let 's hope it works better than the canadian submarines sold by uk  xd / u/citronbleu they were second-hand subs that the uk wanted to get rid of for a stupid low price . 
  either canada could spend the money they had on buying cheap subs or shutdown their submarine arm . 
  it was stupid of canada to buy submarines which had been sitting in saltwater rusting . 
  why ? 
  he 's perfectly entitled to that view . 
  that video is posted here weekly , btw . 
  it 's message somewhat diluted by the ` good riddance ' posted above , 
   i think most londoners , if given a choice , would seek political autonomy from england . 
  and you base this on ? 
   also it 's quite hilarious that the british are pissed off that we call them island apes and the likes . 
  with all the anti-german humour in britain it 's hilarious that you even muster up enough courage to be offended . 
  i do n't know of any briton 's who are pissed off at this . 
  what anti-german humour what that be ? 
   maybe they have to learn it the hard way that they are no longer an empire . 
  nobody in the uk thinks it 's an empire anymore . 
  i only ever hear this from / r/europe . 
  it 's rubbish . 
   while keeping the benefits for the brits . 
  where does it say this ? 
  besides most british people want to see an end to freedom of movement so he 's just reflecting that . 
  though merkel has since told him ` no ' on that point and he 's dropped it . 
  really ? 
  i have n't seen that at all . 
  most of the complaints i saw was that they mix up british and english . 
  quite surprised you want the uk to remain . 
  i remember you saying that the uk was ` really shitty member ' of the eu . 
  yea but germany is n't seeing as something holding up the eu . 
  hence why i 've changed my position and letting the eu progress on without the uk slowing it down . 
  the idea that the uk 's a massive obstruction in the eu is n't new . 
  it 's one i 've seen repeated many times . 
  i 'm not taking it personally . 
  so half the video is spent saying how having the uk in the eu is terrible and then the last half is spent saying how stupid the uk is for wanting to leave ? 
  damned if you do and damned if you do n't i guess . 
  as someone who 's indifferent to the uk leaving/remaining in the eu i 'm now kind of leaning towards leaving and letting you guys get on with your eu . 
  also the video reminded me of the us ' daily show which always just resorts to jokes about royalty on anything to do with the uk . 
  kind of lazy . 
  already posted https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/37ym8r/watch_amazing_scenes_as_bangladeshi_community/, 
  oh , have poland contributed ships to help with the effort ? 
  and as i said in another comment , what about hungary ? 
   but it 's not illegal if they just go to britain and ask for asylum ? 
  you can ask in any of the eu countries . 
  if they stay after being rejected , then they are illegal immigrants . 
  people are supposed to claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in . 
  this clearly is n't the uk if they 're sitting in france . 
   if there was n't a channel they would just walk in as they could in the rest of the eu . 
  --  there are no border checks so anyone could wander from france to germany for example . 
  not really as we have border controls as we 're not part of schengen . 
  they wait in calais until a lorry is crossing the channel into the uk and smuggle aboard it through border control . 
   sweden is taking in a lot more immigrants per capita than britain btw . 
  and ? 
  i 'm talking about illegal migration . 
  good for sweden . 
  that 's nice . 
  when you 've got hundreds of people camping in calais jumping onto lorries hoping to get it into your country it kind of changes things a little . 
  because there 's more to the eu than schengen and the euro . 
  hungary ? 
   first of all , they have very similar political systems . 
  both employ a system based on first past the post . 
  a system designed to be extremely manipulable ( through various means , such as gerrymandering ) and antidemocratic . 
  so does canada and they 're part of the commonwealth so that seems a more apt comparison . 
  oh wait , i guess that would n't be good for the uk/us circlejerk . 
   both countries are also very rightwing .
