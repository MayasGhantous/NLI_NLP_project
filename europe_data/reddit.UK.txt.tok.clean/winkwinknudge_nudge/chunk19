  the uk 's very rightwing ? 
  the one ( excluding n. ireland ) with gay marriage ? 
  half the eu does n't even have that . 
   not to mention that the uk is practically a lapdog to the us , even more so than other european countries . 
  the uk has barely any sovereignty left . 
  if the nsa ( or some other us agency ) asks the uk to jump , the uk asks `` how high ? '', 
  both countries are very hostile to freedom and privacy . 
  as opposed to nearly every eu intelligence agency working with thee nsa . 
  worth noting the us probably offers far more freedoms ( certainly freedom of speech ) than most ( all ? ), 
  eu members . 
   the uk has barely any sovereignty left . 
  just utter bullshit , / u/amanoo  if the nsa ( or some other us agency ) asks the uk to jump , the uk asks `` how high ? '', 
  both countries are very hostile to freedom and privacy . 
  bullshit again but let 's not forget all the eu members who cooperate with the us or the large nsa installation in germany or how many cia black sites the eu has . 
  where 's an example of the uk jumping for the us ? 
  the time it said it ** was n't ** going to war with the us in syria ? 
  shame i thought you may have actually had something of substance other than the typical stupid ` duh lapdog ' crap . 
   someone is butthurt / u/gboss23 na just thought i 'd try and bring a little fact here . 
  found my own source and you 're incorrect . 
   hungary and the uk are two of ** the most euroskeptic countries ** in it . 
  source please . 
  so how 's the uk like a miniature us ? 
   does n't surprise me . 
  the uk is like a miniature us in many respects . 
  / u/amanoo i think that 's the third time i 've seen the uk compared to the us today . 
  i see italy , greece and ireland are worse than the uk on this metric so are they also like a little us ? 
  very good / u/dimetrans . 
  i was wondering how this would be turned into something negative against the uk and you did it . 
  yay !, 
  warning to all ye ' who enter . 
  the comments be crap . 
  as i said i 'm unaware/don ' t believe they 're known for that and i do n't really care enough to go hunting for links . 
  ah right i totally forgot that 's a thing and something that only the us does . 
   the uk is following in the us ' footsteps i see . 
  and what would those be ? 
  meh uk wo n't be a part of it either way so makes no difference to me , 
   maybe , maybe not , more the latter well let 's hope not else you 'll be hoping they leave the eu too and anyone else who 's not for it . 
  did n't realise there was a mass of people taking over dover trying to get into france . 
  it reinforces the point that france does n't really care about illegals going to the uk . 
  kind of shows where their priorities are though . 
   if germany were n't so keen on having a unsc resolution on everything then i can definitely see the eda turning into a serious agency and not some paper tiger . 
  so germany would be the next ` stumbling block ' for creating a european military ? 
   you want to put quota 's on how many europeans get to live in britain ? 
  do you realize how many brits use these treaties themselves in the rest of europe ? 
  polls have shown limiting freedom of movement as well as their own is something most britons want . 
  does n't most of the eu spend a tiny amount on defence ? 
  something like 75 % of the entire eu military spending is from 4 members and one of those being the uk which you 're keen on getting out of your way . 
  how 's the usa come into this ? 
   in 2014 cameron then issued monetary assistance to france to help curb it because it was seriously getting out of hand . 
  and france complained that the money was being spent on security/fence rather than the town 's image ... 
  just curious how it feels when you 're hoping the uk remains in and nearly every comment here it wanting it to leave ? 
   do , have a referendum already . 
  i 'm sick of hearing this whining all the time . 
  the referendum has always been planned for 2016/17 . 
  add ` referendum ' to your res filter and you wo n't be bothered again , 
  spanish is considered to be more useful than french for britons . 
  so you 're allowed opt-outs only if you 're punished for them and try to abolish the opt-outs you 've just secured ... what ? 
  uk opt-outs = bad denmark opt-outs = good because they 're pro-eu and are trying to get rid of their opt-outs . 
  that logic . 
  and i guess you 're providing the obligatory comment moaning about uk coverage ? 
  pro tip : get res and add uk to your filter list and you wo n't be bothered again , 
  you mean you do n't like england . 
   obviously your decision on in/out was decided long ago ; it was ? 
  i 'm completely indifferent on leaving or remaining in the eu . 
  because the guardian is a british paper writing to a british audience so they 're including what impact it may have on britain or how it relates to cameron 's reforms . 
  you seem to be really concerned with what farage and the media have to say about it . 
  i 'm not saying it 's right , but you said non-british people are n't allowed to vote but that 's not true . 
  he is letting non-british people vote ... what 's with your obsession with farage and the daily mail ? 
  no but i should . 
  though they did ban the ~ 1m scots living elsewhere in the uk from voting . 
  no separate statistics . 
   so , essentially , the scots are not as eurosceptic as the english ? 
  they 're not but they 're hardly some huge pro-eu country . 
  london is often one of the most pro-eu part of the uk . 
  59 % of scots want to remain in the eu vs. 28 % who want to leave . 
  42 % of english/welsh want to remain in the eu vs. 37 % who want to leave . 
  a majority of all uk countries want to end freedom of movement . 
  i think scotland also have a couple of ukip meps . 
  why the distinction between british and english ? 
  i 'm not disputing that . 
  what i 'm disputing is that the success of the snp = people want independence . 
  as a thanks for them giving the uk 0 points ? 
  yea he 's not really useless . 
  just annoys me how he often does so poorly in the eu and then convinces the british public of how well he negotiated with them . 
  just like he did with the # 2b bill the uk had . 
   but i am pretty sure that merkel will call his bluff . 
  she already did and he backtracked immediately on wanting to change freedom of movement stuff . 
  he 's useless . 
  i fully believe he 'll get nothing from the eu but crumbs and sell it as some big accomplishment and trick the uk into staying . 
  like he 's done in the past with the eu budget . 
  but what most in the uk ( england , wales , scotland ) want is a cap on migration . 
  like i said cameron will get a few crumbs and sell it as a massive win to the uk . 
   the independence question is far from settled . 
  so she 's going to ignore that a majority voted to remain in the uk ? 
   germany also wants reforms too . 
  though i believe it was merkel who said she 'd rather the uk leave than commit to the reforms that the uk wants . 
   the resounding success of snp makes it obvious that the issue of scottish independence is far from over following last year 's referendum and that , the snp have said they know not everyone who voted snp wants independence . 
  ** edit ** : for those downvoting me :  `` let me be very clear ... even if the snp win every single seat in scotland on thursday it is not a mandate for a referendum on independence . 
  it is a vote to make scotland 's voice heard , '' she told the audience at the bbc 's scottish leaders ' debate on sunday . 
  germany have said they 'd rather the uk leave and as you said , france have ruled out those sort of changes .
