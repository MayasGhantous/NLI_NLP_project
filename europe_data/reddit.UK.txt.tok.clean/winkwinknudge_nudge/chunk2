  yes .

   and a lot of uk people feel they are special or better , why else would you wan na leave ? 
  do n't think it has anything to do with being better or special . 
  i mean poland , denmark and ireland all have secured opt-outs but people do n't seem to raise concern with them thinking they 're better . 
  some people feel the benefits of being in the eu are n't worth it and are outweighed by the negatives . 
  though 41 % favour remaining vs. 40 % to leave the eu in the last poll . 
   meh , we 're just used to the fact that uk wants to leave us since they 've been talking about it for long . 
  popular opinion favours remaining . 
  always had done . 
  yea you kind of painted yourself in a corner . 
  never mind , eh ? 
  and how exactly does that prevent other nations from being involved in the mission which you stated earlier ? 
   without the u.s logistics , no nation would have been involved .

  ok just completely ignore my link then . 
  that works as well i guess . 
   if the uk leaves there is nothing to stop a federal eu . 
  how do you arrive at this ? 
  if anything i 'd think more countries would have to speak out against federalization rather than hiding behind the uk if it were to leave . 
  is n't it silly to think the uk is the only thing preventing federalization and everyone else is onboard for it ? 
   uh uh uh uh downvoted ! . 
  well , let 's see , when was , in recent past , the last time the french military needed help ? 
  the intervention in mali .

  torrentfreak is terrible website with nothing but sensational headlines . 
   `` it is reasonable for isps to be placed under an obligation to identify user behaviour that is ` suspicious ' and indicative of a user engaging in conduct that infringes copyright . 
  such behaviour may include the illegitimate use by internet users of ip obfuscation tools in combination with high download volumes . 
   the determination of what an ` illegitimate ' use of such tools is , and the threshold of what would be considered a ` high ' download volume over a period of time , would need to take into account legitimate explanations in order to avoid false positives and to safeguard the fundamental rights of consumers -- such matters would be open to further industry discussion and agreement .

    did someone tell this guy yet that politics are n't there to give him a european monopoly ? 
  you 're missing the point entirely . 
  he 's not after a monopoly , his grievance is that his voice was n't counted . 
  like he says in the article germany dominated the discussions surrounding it and felt he was n't being listened too so why be there ?

  german industry federation ( bdi ) spokesman replied to the comments :  `` the uk has a different position because industry 's share of gdp there is much smaller , around 10 percent compared with 25 percent in germany . '' germany looking out for germany . 
   with the uk about to be split that 's not certain . 
  both the recent panelbase and unweighted yougov poll favoured no .

  you think british identity is a construct from london ? 
  pretty sure england still has socialised healthcare and wealthfare last time i checked .

  nation | spend per head -- | -- n. ireland | 10,876 scotland | 10,152 wales | 9,709 england | 8,788 yea it 's crappy what happened to the university fees but when you look at the arrangement with loans , etc.

   we 're kicking terminally ill people off welfare because their `` scroungers '' ?

  no one is playing empires .

  i was being sarcastic because / u/shitfacephil makes out it 's a new thing and it 's unique to the uk and as though it 's something which happens regularly . 
  well you 've said you hope the uk leave , today you 've said * when * your economy tanks , etc. 
  as i said in my comment it 's hard to guess when no one knows the kind of relationship the uk/eu would have in the event of the uk leave . 
  edit : i removed the quotes but it honestly seems like you want the uk to tank from reading them as you seem pretty hostile to the uk . 
  this seems more like wishful thinking on your part .
