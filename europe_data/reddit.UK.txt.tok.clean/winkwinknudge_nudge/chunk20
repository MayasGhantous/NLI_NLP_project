  if he thinks it 's in the uk 's interest . 
  he 's not ruled out campaigning to leave . 
  he 'll get nothing from the negotiations but sell it as a win with people buying it and voting to stay in . 
  edit : why even post here anymore ? 
  i get downvoted for expressing an opinion . 
  poor trolling attempt . 
  there 's no need to comment all at once . 
   the ebu announced plans to relaunch the series in summer 2007 with belgium , croatia , spain , greece , netherlands , portugal , slovenia and italy thought to be participating countries . 
  however due to financial setbacks , the plans were put on hold - originally for 12 months but later abandoned altogether . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jeux_sans_fronti%c3%a8res#revival_attempt ), 
  how else are they going to get the information ? 
  by reading their mind ? 
  i asked a question to op on why he thought it was going to change the world . 
   and if i wanted to i could find a way to diminish what you did by picking out a detail . 
  you mean where you said ` that 's a bit rich , the uk has n't fully done it yet . ', 
  i think you already did that . 
  calm down ... 
   i do n't want to be a dick but if you want to play that game they uk has n't full done it yet . 
  / u/jimmyjimryan and your point being ? 
  what game was a trying to play ? 
  pointing out allowing gay marriage in a country of < 5m and not some trailblazer either , might not be a ` turning point for gay rights world wide . ' . 
  ** edit ** : why did you change your comment ? 
   this could be a turning point for gay rights world wide . 
  why ? 
  are n't you kind of behind the curve ? 
  that 's right the uk wants to get rid of all human rights / s you 've spent too much time on this sub , / u/debau, 
  because there 's some things the uk does n't want from the eu but have been told they 'd rather the uk leave than change them . 
  the amount of crap the uk gets for having close ties to the us ( lapdog , 51st state , etc. ), 
  i ca n't see that happening . 
  i do n't expect much from it . 
  he wanted to limit immigration . 
  that 's not going to happen . 
  he wanted to limit certain types of benefit and today most leaders have come out against it . 
  more like cameron starts on plan to convince british people he 's actually going to get a deal . 
  but you 're saying the uk should leave now . 
  the uk 's not opt-out of anything to do with freedom of movement . 
  so some opt-outs are allowed unless you 're the uk ? 
   by blackmailing i meant his constant reform demands in the eu or leave the eu wanting to change something in the eu is now called blackmailing ? 
  it 's quite odd to call a dissenting opinion ` blackmailing ' . 
  also odd when he 's only just begun talks on reforms today . 
  not sure how it 's been constant . 
   scotland has quite often made their wishes heard to remain part of the european union , cameron however does only care about the `` city '' while screws over the rest of england , the majority of the uk want to remain in the eu , not just scotland . 
   scotland also has its wishes for independence and they in my mind have the full right to do so , i believe that snp being quite successful this time around there proves this right . 
  scotland had its chance for independence in september last year and they voted ` no ' . 
  did you forget that ? 
  the snp have specifically said they know not everyone who voted for the snp want independence . 
   he himself is the one breaking an union , and that is an union with other europeans ( or is that not as important for you ? ), 
  since when is he breaking up the eu ? 
   they truly believe that cameron will do everything to leave the eu and my friends , your fellow countrymen do not want this to happen , then they do n't really follow the news considering cameron has said he hopes the uk remains in the eu . 
  how 's he blackmailed them ? 
  what 's he gotten from them ? 
   honestly , i 'd be glad if scotland broke off from uk , that would be the most epic middle finger at this jerk . 
  you 'd break up a union to spite one man ? 
  wow . 
  because there can only be one world power ? 
   so if the uk actually wants to destroy the right to freely live and work wherever people want in the union ; one of the core tenets ; then so be it . 
  it should be shown where the door is , and asked if it wants to stay inside and get on with it , or leave . 
   i highly doubt that is the case , however . 
  - 41 % of scotland want to impose restrictions on it ( vs. 35 % ) . 
  - 41 % of london want to impose restrictions on it ( vs. 31 % ) . 
  - 50 % of south england want to impose restrictions on it ( vs. 25 % ) . 
  - 52 % of midlands/wales want to impose restrictions on it ( vs. 23 % ) . 
  - 52 % of north want to impose restrictions on it ( vs. 23 % ) . 
   all issues could be put to bed if the uk you know , acted like it wanted to be in the eu rather than being the one at the table with his eyes on every available exit . 
  and like i asked before how could the issue be put to bed ? 
  freedom of movement is n't something the uk wants , cameron has said he wants to see it changed and the eu is saying have it or gtfo . 
  there are other countries who 've secured opt-outs . 
  do you want them to leave as well ? 
  polls have shown a majority of british people do n't want freedom of movement . 
   i hope that these issues can be put to bed and the uk can actually become a major player in the eu , rather than acting like it was dragged in and is looking for the escape hatch at every opportunity . 
  i 'm not sure how you can put it to bed when everyone here is saying gtfo . 
  strange considering back in [ february ] ( http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/britain-aerospace.wmw ) they said leaving would n't make any difference . 
   he ( fabrice bregier ) said `` in the uk i will look at two parameters : the exchange rate between the pound and the dollar and the second one is the uk government continuing support for the development of the aerospace industry . '', 
   bregier said airbus was very pleased with all the initiatives of the government of british prime minister david cameron , and did not believe that would change if britain left the eu . 
  i believe that if these two parameters are stable there would be no reason for airbus to change our strategy in the uk ... '' said bregier . 
   the company employs 10,000 people in britain developing and making wings , fuel systems and landing gears for its aircraft . 
   we `` have no intention to duplicate all this expertise , '' said bregier . 
  guess it 's time they start the fear mongering ? 
  [ airbus sees no reason to leave if britain quits eu ] ( https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/airbus-sees-no-reason-leave-221121128.html ), 
   in some newspapers he 's praised like its the second coming of christ . 
  which newspapers would those be ? 
  editorialized headlines are n't allowed . 
  they 're obsessed with negative stuff and britain . 
  today there was an item about cameron from february . 
  anything other than that ( like this ) is heavily downvoted . 
  it just seems a really weasley way for romanians to say ` pff they 're nothing to do with us ' . 
   he 's just pointing out that citizenship and ethnicity are two is ` gypsy ' a type of citizenship ? 
  not sure the comparison really works . 
   i 'm not trying to contradict your point . 
  i simply do not know what your point is , unless it 's to annoy me . 
  to annoy you ? 
  you 're the one who replied to me . 
  you 're going off on about syria and isis ...  if you seriously think the news is n't surprising , then you 're woefully ignorant . 
  you mean my first comment where i specifically said ** ` not surprising ' ** was n't clear to you ? 
   right , and given how many brits there are in syria overall , there is an unusually high number of brits involved in isis . 
  i still do n't understand your broader point . 
  / u/zoorope so are you trying to contradict my point or just going for a typical ` whataboutism ' ? 
  ` oh yeah well what about ... ' as the article is about the uk and romanians i thought i 'd stick with that . 
   romanians = / = roma/gypsies when will pakis learn the difference ? 
  i think it should be added as an annex to quran as using the internet is apparently too complex for you .
