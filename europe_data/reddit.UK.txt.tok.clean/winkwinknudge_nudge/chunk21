  / u/pokymonn referring to me as a ` paki ' ? 
  well that 's a first . 
   indeed ; the same as uk citizens are involved in a disproportionate amount of crime in syria and in iraq . 
   -  however when taken together with the prison population figures , it does seem reasonable to conclude that romania has an unusually high number of its citizens involved in crime given the size of the romanian population in the uk . 
  yup cameron is literally east germany . 
  this confirms it . 
  good job / u/this _ is_the_end, 
   except if you check police data you 'll be surprised to see that they 're not doing more crime than any other immigrant group . 
  and that makes it ok ? 
  i thought the article was on about romanians ... 
  though as someone has linked to romanians * are * accountable for a disproportionate number of crimes in the uk . 
  as i said in my original , downvoted comment . 
   actually i read recently that they do just slightly more crime than the polish which is not bad considering the high amount of gypsy immigrants from romania . 
  i 'd say it 's quite bad when polish are the largest group of immigrants in the uk . 
  meh see i 'm getting downvoted regardless . 
  romanians have a strong presence on this sub i guess . 
  not surprising . 
  romanians are involved in a disproportionate amount of crime in the uk . 
  edit : downvoted for stating fact .

  glad to hear it . 
   to be more specific then the english are mostly against it . 
  -  i think scotland is similar to any other eu country , in that there are those who support a federation , there are sceptics , but most do support eu as a whole and snp ( biggest party in scotland ) is strongly pro-europe and would pursue joining the eu , if they became independent . 
  so where 's the data to backup this ? 
  i 'd be interested and surprised that the scottish support a federalization as across the eu support is around 41 % . 
  so to say the english are against it and the scottish are in favour of it really needs a little data to back it up . 
  i mean most english people support remaining in the eu but you seem to think the english hate the eu here and the scottish are some huge pro-eu country . 
   to be more specific then the english are mostly against it . 
  do you have any polls which specifically say the non-english in the uk want a federation ? 
  does n't scotland have a couple of ukip meps ? 
   allow us to truly reform the union without the usa 's lapdog doing everything in its power to slow the process down . 
  how has this shown itself in the past ? 
   but it 's not a politically correct opinion so you wo n't see this upvoted . 
  na it 's just when this assertion is challenged people typically do n't have anything of substance to back it up . 
   , it 's not like everybody wants to leave the eu over here . 
  but 36 % is n't a small number either .

  jcb treats its workers pretty well regardless of the eu . 
  `` someone does n't want to be in the eu ? 
  oh well he must want to get rid of all workers rights ... '' sounds a lot like people who accuse me of being xenophobic or patriotic for not being a flag-waving europhile here . 
  i remember it 's presented by stuart hall :  he was charged with multiple sexual offences in december 2012 and january 2013 . 
  although he initially denied any wrongdoing , he pleaded guilty in april 2013 to having indecently assaulted 13 girls , aged between 9 and 17 years old , between 1967 and 1986 . 
   yes , so what ? 
  that does n't mean i am opposed to them staying . 
  you want the uk to leave . 
  you 've said * exactly * that . 
  it 's odd you can `` we do n't want the uk '' and then `` oh well i 'm not against them staying '' . 
  wtf ? 
  why are you trying to change it as though you 're all for a referendum and letting people decide . 
  it 's clear as day you 'd rather the uk leave . 
  because the eu 's totally prevented that right ? 
   i am advocating for letting them leave if they so desire . 
  really ?

   if you do n't want to put them in a tough spot , do n't leave the eu . 
  we have set up an arrangement that is mutually beneficial , albeit in different ways , for everybody . 
  if you break it up then ireland only has you to blame . 
  a majority in the uk do n't want to leave but you 're the one who 's advocating for england to leave the eu . 
  he [ has ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2u82sp/is_this_the_kind_of_union_we_want/co6am30?context=3 ) a [ chip ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2nd2d3/polish_ambassador_to_uk_we_want_our_doctors_back/cmctiu2?context=3 ) on [ his ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2tfr2w/george_osborne_tells_europeans_to_pull_their/cnyngc9?context=3 ) shoulders [ about ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2nilz5/should_the_eu_become_one_single_nation/cmdzru0?context=3 ) the [ uk ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2mbnay/since_were_talking_about_luxembourg_i_would_like/ ) . 
  i 'm sure ireland would be completely understanding then . 
  nope i 'm utterly indifferent on it . 
  ah right i remember you 're one who wants britain to exit the eu . 
   yes , but ireland is rich these days anyway , and saving the union would the most important priority . 
   so you 're willing to hurt other countries to retaliate against the uk ? 
   if you divorce me then do n't expect a key to my apartment . 
  seems kind of petty . 
  ah right it 's just you 've made two comments about `` suppose we kick the uk out '' , so you can see how it comes across as you wanting to kick the uk out and sort of borderline threats . 
  since when are countries kicked out of the eu ? 
  such hostility . 
  exactly like that though scotland talks of a roaring lion and their voice finally being heard ... 
  they 're a little more dramatic . 
  the snp have specifically said they understand not everyone who voted for snp wants independence . 
  they 're not taking their victory as a sign that people support independence . 
  i just dislike the snp for blaming all their problems on the english   ( after refusing independence , which sounds a bit weird ) weird to you and / r/europe maybe . 
  though i find it weird how people here would like england to leave and act as though scotland 's some poor country under tyranny of the uk . 
   i think the eu would be pretty well without england . 
  i hope scotland joins after they 've seceded from the uk . 
  nice . 
  what makes you think scotland is leaving the uk ? 
   you keep bringing the same point in every single romania internet related thread , big whoop , a lot of us are poor . 
  so you 'd rather just focus on how fast connections are . 
  got it . 
  let 's ignore that romania has one of the highest fixed-cost broadband prices , if you can download [ your 50gb of porn quickly ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35xt9b/the_major_isp_in_romania_increased_the_download/cr91xqj ) , it 's all good . 
  though you [ deleted all your comments from our last discussion . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/359n8t/brexit_referendum_looms_after_tory_election/cr2pise )  it 's not an understatement to say that romania has one of the best telecom infrastructures in the eu . 
  ranked 28th out of 28 overall in the eu ... 
  quite rich coming from someone in denmark who 's secured a ton of opt-outs from the eu . 
  ignoring the fact that ireland and denmark have also opt-out . 
   ireland also opted out but plans to take in as many refugees as the system would have allocated to it . 
  denmark , the third state enjoying exemptions , said it would follow its own policy . 
  guess you want denmark and ireland to leave the eu also ? 
   so , really , the article is full of shit . 
  that 's fairly standard for techdirt . 
  [ currently ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#2015 ) 45 % want to remain while 36 % would like to leave . 
  i think it could easily go either way . 
  cameron is unlikely to get anything substantial in the negotiations , he 's also hoping to bring the referendum forward a year to 2016 . 
  which is why theresa may said there should also be tolerance . 
   speaking on bbc radio 4 today , however , the home secretary theresa may said that tolerance and rule of law were ` british values ' . 
   `` [ the measures are ] bigger picture , a strategy which will also have as a key part of it actually promoting our british values , our values of democracy , rule of law , tolerance and acceptance of different faiths , '' she said .
