  all the bases are covered / u/maxi _ w !, 
  we should n't be totally tolerant but also remember to be tolerant . 
  it 's as clear as day . 
  unsurprisingly a click-baity headline . 
   `` for too long , we have been a passively tolerant society , saying to our citizens ` as long as you obey the law , we will leave you alone ' , '' he said . 
   ** `` it 's often meant we have stood neutral between different values . 
  and that 's helped foster a narrative of extremism and grievance . '' **, 
  yea he was [ american . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/coppercab ) i 've been on receiving end of it a little but this was before south park came along with the soulless thing so i 'd imagine it 's probably a bit worse now . 
  meh it happens . 
  he should stand up for himself a little more . 
  edit : thought i guess not in the way he was planning . 
  i mean give them a talking to ... or something ... 
  what 's wrong with the bbc ? 
  cameron wants to bring it forward to 2016 . 
  wtf / u / _ maxiking _ ? 
  ever the opportunist , eh ? 
  because many think that # 8bn is n't enough . 
  [ there 's a large number of companies related to tories who 've been awarded many nhs contracts . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/03/healthcare-companies-links-tories-nhs-contracts ) you begin to wonder why things are being privatised and contracted out . 
   i have never seen anyone from germany or switzerland here talk about reforming their healthcare systems , never seen one complain about it . 
  well the conservatives did say they would n't touch the nhs then they conducted the largest reorganisation of the nhs . 
  i think the problem is most of the things the conservatives have said about the nhs whether it be no frontline cuts , no massive reorganisation they 've gone on to do . 
  there 's just a lack of trust in them handling it . 
  i 've read many times on here that the uk should leave or even be thrown out of the eu . 
   i 'm just annoyed by this holier than thou bullshit a lot of people on here will pull when it comes to their country , and in this thread it 's you lot doing this . 
  holier than thou ? 
  are n't you the one labelling the uk as a shitty member ? 
   either that 's a typo , or it 's the most retarded policy i 've heard of . 
  na it 's in their manifesto :  we have already capped the level of skilled economic migration from outside the eu . 
  we will maintain our cap at 20,700 during the next parliament . 
  this will ensure that we only grant visas to those who have the skills we really need in our economy . 
   does someone has a source for that `` requirement '' ? 
  http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-05-30/sex-drugs-and-accounting-in-europe quite funny people here are twisting the uk following eu recommendations as a bad thing . 
  damned if you do and damned if you do n't . 
  it 's also on the [ european commission 's site ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-14-594_en.htm ) :  ** why are illegal activities being included in gdp calculations ? 
  **  gdp is about measuring all economic activity . 
  both declared and undeclared ( which includes illegal ) activities need to be taken into account in order to have a full and accurate picture of the value of production/consumption in a given period . 
   there was a need , however , to agree on standards on how to measure illegal activities . 
  therefore , common methodological guidelines have been agreed between the european commission and the member states to ensure consistency in the way that all member states measure these activities for statistical purposes . 
  these guidelines concern prostitution , the production and trafficking of drugs , and alcohol and tobacco smuggling . 
  by 22 september 2014 all member states are required to comply with these guidelines . 
  these methodological recommendations have no direct relation with esa 2010 . 
   in the uk it was massively beneficial for the government to cook the figures to show exceptional gdp growth . 
  to boot they also got to complain about the increased eu membership fees too which was popular with the voters . 
   in france it 's a little different , the government is pro-eu and does n't want to stoke anti-eu anger by inviting a massive great bill , and people probably do n't care as much about gdp growth as they do in the uk anyway . 
  but the uk 's following the eu 's recommendation on including such activity ... how 's it the uk being anti-eu and cooking the figures by doing what the eu wants ? 
  bit crass with jeep and us flag but pretty great of him pay for his 6,400 employees to go on a four-day holiday in france . 
   chinese company has paid for 6,400 of its employees to go on a four-day holiday to france . 
   the biggest tour group to visit the country was welcomed in the southern resort of nice on saturday . 
   tiens group president li jinyuan booked up 140 hotels in paris and more than 4,700 rooms in cannes and monaco for their trip . 
   their holiday included a private viewing of the louvre museum and a mass visit to the moulin rouge cabaret show . 
   local media say that the group is expected to spend some $ 13m ( $ 14.6 m ; # 9.5 m ) in total . 
   `` so far everything has gone smoothly , the feedback has been extremely positive , '' he said , as quoted by the agence france-presse news agency . 
   the tourists have hired 146 buses to drive them around for the duration of their holiday . 
  [ bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-32677965 ), 
  and then mentions it at every opportunity . 
   i never said `` keep away '' . 
  i said `` keep a distance '' which merely means i 'll observe people 's behavior for a certain period of time and try to figure out which way this will likely go . 
  keep a distance is exactly the same thing as keeping away . 
  you never said anything about observing . 
  you 're trying to soften it now . 
   mildly put , an unpleasant annoying/unpleasant is very plausible nowadays . 
   in fact you almost nailed one : yes and people said farage was xenophobic for saying that . 
  like i said keeping away from people / ` observing them from a distance ' solely based on their nationality is just simple xenophobia . 
  thanks for talking to me though . 
  i know speaking to a british person must have been a very traumatic experience for you . 
  yes that 's pretty much * the * definition of xenophobia . 
   dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries . 
  you avoid a group of people solely based on their nationality . 
  you said you try and keep away from british people . 
  seems like a fairly obvious case of xenophobia with a bit of anglophobia in there too . 
  very similar to when farage said he did n't want to live next door to romanians . 
  disappointing from someone who travels alot , / u/alxkls0 . 
  you got ` burned ' and now you 're xenophobic to 60 million people . 
  it 's ok you do n't have to try and convince me . 
  i 'm sure you 've got your reasons . 
  and if you look at [ most of the tweets ] ( https://twitter.com/hashtag/thanetrigged?f=realtime&amp;src=tren ) it 's people talking about how ridiculous it is . 
   the referendum i hope will just solidify our position in the eu . 
  like the scottish indy referendum did ? 
  ah right . 
  sounds like it changes as much as the weather does in the uk . 
  you go to a place you call ` gray ' for a holiday ? 
  it does but merkel has said she 'd rather the uk leave than touch that . 
   i know , well uk from outside looks really gray to me . . not a place i would like to live yet [ you say you spend a lot of time there ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/358lh4/what_should_atheists_do_with_their_bodies_after/cr26940 ) . 
   well i been an organ donor in usa , uk , es , dk in case i died in any of those countries which i spend most of the time ... / u/jycr753, 
   allowing us to control immigration , then it will be unpredictable . 
  they wo n't . 
  cameron has already changed what reforms he wants and dropped freedom of movement reform after merkel told him ` no ' . 
  so you think that if anyone wants to leave the eu they 're simply just xenophobic patriots ? 
  considering the libdems stopped it last time it 's hardly surprising they 'll push it through now . 
  so do you agree with every law that the eu has passed ? 
   i see this as xenophobia it 's not xenophobia . 
  if you wanted to keep one particular nationality/race/type out based solely on that , then that 'd be xenophobia . 
  you 're saying any country on earth that does n't have freedom of movement is a xenophobic country . 
  it 's silly . 
   also there are a massive number of brits living in the eu . 
  the numbers between eu  uk is quite close to uk  eu . 
  not to mention that eu immigrants are hard working , tax paying people who contribute to the country . 
  absolutely and i 'm not really arguing one way or the other .
