  i 'm fairly indifferent to the eu . 
  you asked a question and i replied that it 's more than xenophobia and patriotism . 
   and i see that as patriotism . 
  and again i 'd disagree . 
  some eu laws prevent the uk from doing things like with prisoner voting . 
  i do n't see how patriotism comes into that . 
   winston churchill saw that the eu needs to happen due to unity ( which would discourage another european war ) and the fact that europe is falling from the throne it had during the 20th century . 
   something else , all the arguments used for brexit can be used for the divide of the uk . 
  can you honestly say that it would be for the best of the people if the uk divided ? 
  the uk was at its peak when it was an empire . 
  further division would render it weaker and weaker . 
  that 's really for the scottish people to decide . 
  do n't read this as though i 'm trying to break up the eu or leave . 
  as i said i 'm fairly apathetic to remaining or leaving like most in the uk are . 
   but rural households still have only bt or at most 2 providers they can chose from , no ? 
  it 's similar everywhere in europe and there needs to be done something to give companies incentives for some competition for rural areas . 
  i 'm fairly rural ( < 800 houses ) and can choose from probably a dozen or so providers . 
  bt has to legally allow competitors to use bt fibre/infrastructure so there 's no reason why people should only be able to receive bt as their isp . 
   you might be using old data , since the subscription rate was 84 % at the end of 2014 . 
  because that 's including mobile broadband . 
  the figure i referenced was for fixed home broadband and was from the [ eu 's digital agenda report ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/scoreboard/romania ) . 
   romania has two main challenges in connectivity . 
  first , it needs to improve coverage of fixed broadband networks , which reach only 90 % of households , significantly below the eu average ( 97 % ) . 
  second , it needs to increase the number of broadband subscribers : only 54 % of households subscribe to fixed broadband and only 43 % of citizens to mobile broadband , limiting romania 's ability to exploit the benefits of the digital economy . 
  the likes of stormfront have been known to try and brigade this sub . 
  a video posted on some obscure youtube channel does n't find itself posted 3 times on / r/europe by coincidence . 
  you guys are out in force i see . 
  this has already been posted * twice * before : * https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/353xdb/muslim_march_against_islamophobia_a_great_watch * https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/352duc/englands_largest_muslim_march_in_nelson/, 
  how are any of the things i listed xenophobic/patriotism-related ? 
   how much choice do customers in rural uk households have ? 
  apart from bt what other choice is there ? 
  many ? 
  bt are forced by the regulator to allow other companies to use their fibre/copper . 
   meanwhile that same ` competition ' resulted in the uk severely lagging behind other eu members when it comes to telecom infrastructure , subscription speeds and prices . 
  the uk 's ranked 6th out of all eu members for its digital services ( romania 's 28th/28 ) . 
  not sure how 6th is ` severely lagging behind ' . 
   and if you want to play that game then know that uk 's current average connection speed is what romania had 6 years ago , mate . 
  and romania 's coverage falls below that of the eu average , only 54 % actually subscribe and it 's got one of the highest entry-prices for broadband in the eu . 
  other than higher speeds i fail to see what 's great about it . 
  a majority do n't want freedom of movement . 
  many want to be able to control immigration . 
  some do n't like the eu having legislation over the uk . 
  some see it as a loss of sovereignty . 
   are there any reasons for brexit not counting xenophobia and patriotism ? 
  nothing to do with xenophobia or patriotism to begin with . 
  and the snp said this should n't be taken as a sign for another referendum and they know people voting snp do n't necessarily want to leave the uk . 
   i 've been accused of anglophobia on more than one occasion but rest assured , no such thing . 
  later  do i keep a distance ? 
  yes . 
  yeah ... 
  i can see why people accuse you of being that . 
   without any restrictions or penalties . 
  so they get to opt-out of the euro and schengen ? 
  you 've had 5 years ... why now ? 
   yeah , because the polls are always accurate !, 
  they 're pretty consistent . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#2015 i 'll take that over someone saying `` oh eurosceptics are going to get their way and we 'll leave the eu '' . 
  but a majority of the population wants to remain in the eu . 
  who 's leaving ? 
   it also can not be ignored if 45 % of the population want to leave . 
  that 's [ ** 34 % ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#2015 ) . 
  support for leaving has been in decline in recent months . 
  why post this now ? 
  because britons are very concerned of what europeans think of their election ? 
  but to say a party is racist , surely they must have a racist agenda ? 
  not that they 've found a few of their candidates to be racist and kicked them out . 
   not to mention the fact that they are still fundamentally a single-issue party with no credible policy to bring to the table , other than pulling up the drawbridge and keeping the immigrants out . 
  again that 's not racist but having a preference for immigration control over the eu 's freedom of movement . 
  if they 'd said only let x people in then i 'd agree with you but they have n't . 
  did n't really answer the question . 
  it 's already been posted ... - https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/352duc/englands_largest_muslim_march_in_nelson/ that youtube channel 's just filled with stuff about muslims liked geert wilders speeches . 
  what 's the relevancy of this ? 
   who should we thank for the many british overseas territories which are notorious for being conducive to tax dodging ? 
  huh ? 
  what 's that got to do with the eu investigating an american company using tax loophole in luxembourg ? 
   maybe we should push for financial reform so this kind of cuntery is n't legally possible ? 
  but that would upset many politically well connected and influential companies . 
  / u/andrei _ tv [ cameron was already doing that in 2013 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/04/cameron-tax-havens-g8-summit ) . 
  do n't let it stop you moaning about the british though . 
  though the article is really about british people in europe being able to access the iplayer . 
  not non-brits being able to access it . 
   `` we note the commission 's interest in making services more portable to uk users while temporarily travelling in europe , and will begin work to look at the technical and legislative implications , '' said a spokesman . 
  and only 18 comments ... 
   the question is - is this french surveillance , or us-french surveillance ( as in case of germany ) ? 
   what 's the difference ? 
  i would n't say the uk wanting a referendum and 34 % wanting to leave the eu ( vs. 56 % ) is a ` non-story ' . 
  is someone forcing you to read these ? 
  you always seem to moan when there 's a thread on here about the uk . 
  install res and add uk to your filter list and you wo n't be bothered again . 
  na it 's fairly well known that most european agencies are with the uk/us . 
  they just like to feign outrage as though they 're better than that . 
  it 's pretty easy to not care . 
   but maybe you can answer a question : why are there armed policemen stationed round the clock outside the embassy ? 
  is this done in every case where foreing police wants to question a brit resident ? 
   because he broke bail conditions and is now wanted by british police . 
  it 's fairly obvious . 
   the uk reports every eu meeting in great details to the us . 
   source ? 
  i like how you completely forget to mention all the eu agencies involved in spying and lay the blame on the us and uk . 
  you know , despite this very article being about the german bnd ...
