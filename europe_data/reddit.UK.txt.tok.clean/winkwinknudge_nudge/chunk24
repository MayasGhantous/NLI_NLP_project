  when are people here going to hold their own government culpable instead of acting the us was twisting their arm with no choice . 
   their invasion of the guardian to destroy hard drives ( freedom of the press ? ), 
  / u/kairho the guardian were told they could be sued or they could destroy the drives . 
  they chose to destroy the drives knowing they 'd likely lose a court case . 
   detention of david miranda under a pretense of terrorism . 
  / u/kairho the guy who was traveling with stolen national secrets and is n't a journalist . 
  it was also deemed to be lawful detainment by the high court . 
  are you mad ? 
  the amount of times i 've seen people saying the uk should be kicked out of the eu for spying , not really european , only working for the us . 
  says the guy who turned on the audience at a bbc debate . 
  accusing the bbc of hand-picking them , only to be told they were chosen by an independent polling organisation . 
  why include the us bit as though germany should n't be held responsible for their actions ? 
  i think it 's a little called democracy , 
   tl ; dr what is the stance of the british people , do you want to get out or is that just an image advertised by most media there . 
  i know scotland do not want to leave the eu . 
  british people want a referendum on membership . 
  45 % want to stay while 35 % want to leave . 
   i know scotland do not want to leave the eu . 
  and from the polls nobody in the uk does . 
   how is me calling it the biggest single obstacle to federation so fucking controversial ? 
  it 's not controversial as many in / r/europe seem to agree with you . 
  just funny how you 're blaming the uk for a lack of federation when there 's really not much support for one across the eu . 
  good luck with kicking out every country which does n't support what * you * want though . 
  it 's exactly like i said in my original comment then . 
  blaming the uk for a lack of federation . 
   for a start , cameron only promised a referendum if he got a majority - which wo n't happen . 
  -  `` and i 've said very clearly that whatever the outcome of the next general election -- and of course i want an overall majority and i 'm hoping and believing i can win an overall majority -- but people should be in no doubt that i will not become prime minister unless i can guarantee that we can hold that referendum . '' '', 
  - cameron i 'm not worried either way though . 
   i 'd like to see how far we can get without british resistance ... as though the uk 's the thing holding it all up . 
  really when cameron has said he would n't be against campaigning to leave if he does n't get his ` reforms ' ? 
  immigration being the number one concern and being told there 's nothing you can do about it ? 
   i 'd like to see how far we can get without british resistance ... 
  probably as far as until the next country goes against it . 
  it has around 40 % support across the eu there 's not a lot of support to begin with . 
  quite funny how people like you blame the lack of a federation solely on the uk . 
  fewer laws/regulation to implement , lower fees , but less influence . 
  though i think reports have said this would n't be a good choice for the uk and david cameron rejected the idea of it also . 
   what by all means seems impossible to happen . 
  why 's that ? 
  says the guy who thinks the uk would * ` you will get fucked after you leave . 
  ' * the eu or * ` without the eu they have nothing . 
  they 're slightly ahead of labour . 
  not sure . 
  i posted a link to the report in my previous comment but it 's a little light on details . 
  [ might be of some use . 
  ] ( https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/projekte/30_global_economic_dynamics/zusatzgrafik_zur_pm_bip-einbussen_en.jpg ) eu would be -0.36 % . 
  [ chart : additional gross payments to the eu budget after a brexit ] ( https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/projekte/30_global_economic_dynamics/zusatzgrafik_zur_pm_eu-beitraege_en.jpg ) you can download [ the 7 page report here ] ( https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/en/publications/publication/did/policy-brief-201505-br-brexit-potential-economic-consequences-if-the-uk-exits-the-eu/ ) . 
  [ sure he will . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/jebtmcx.jpg ) it wo n't be enough . 
  cameron and a majorty of britons want a change to freedom of movement and juncker has specifically said * `` i do exclude major treaty changes as far as the freedom of movement is concerned - but other points can be mentioned , '' he told reporters . * . 
  it 's not going to be enough . 
  this is not surprising at all . 
  i dunno ukip seem to be doing ok , 
  ukip it is ? 
   the uk is looking at rules that will require britons to keep a passport on hand at all times in order to access the nhs . 
  -  these sorts of erosions are happening throughout the continent what erosion is that ? 
  it 's a ** national ** health service . 
  how is ensuring it 's used by ** nationals ** an erosion ? 
  edit : why was i downvoted for asking a question ? 
  i 'm sure many in the eu would be fine with bulgaria accepting more refugees . 
   edit : guy did n't like the fact that people were hurting his karma nope i just did n't see the point in having a discussion if i was just being down voted no matter what i said . 
  just like this post . 
  that 's the european union act 2011 . 
  that 's already in [ law ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/11/eu-bill-explained ) . 
  i do n't get it . 
  for england & wales ons :  the age-standardised suicide rate for all persons has been increasing since 2009 and reached 15.6 deaths per 100,000 population in 2013 . 
  scotland :  this equates to an age-standardised rate of 14.0 deaths per 100,000 population . 
  how come the uk 's that low on the map ? 
  there is n't but the eu 's plan is for further integration and for federalization . 
  what are you voting for if the eu plans something that you do n't want ? 
  [ support for eu federation . 
  personally i 'm not really fussed on either option . 
  date | stay | leave | unsure -- | -- | -- | -- 19 -- 20 april | 45 | 35 | 16 10 -- 12 april | 40 | 39 | 17 8 -- 9 april | 45 | 41 | 14 26 -- 30 march | 35 | 34 | 25 24 -- 26 march | 49 | 44 | 7 18 -- 25 march | 41 | 38 | 17, 
   i would vote against further integration though . 
  i 'm not interested in belonging to some federal european state . 
  but that 's where the eu is heading . 
  it 's kind of the plan . 
  for sure  `` germans were a little grumpy at not being invited to join the 9-eyes group . '', 
  - [ gchq ] ( http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/11/nsa-germany-insulted-it-got-left-out-of-spying.html ) . 
   significantly , amid the german protestations of outrage over us eavesdropping on merkel and other germans , berlin is using the controversy as leverage for an upgrade to 5-eyes . 
  says who , you ? 
  why did you add ' ** white ** ' into the item ? 
  it does n't appear in the article at all . 
  geographical proximity . 
  right because people who do n't learn another language are just arrogant patriotic song singing simpletons . 
  right ? 
  speak : - english -- i get by, 
  so we 're just going to ignore the rule about editorialised headlines ? 
   and do n't even get me started on britain . 
  why not ? 
  that 's not democracy but freedom of movement . 
  do you really have to try and derail it to make it about romanian migration and playing the victim ? 
  most polls are fully weighted to take in certain demographics and changes and is considered to be representative of the uk population . 
  [ most polls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#2015 ) are stuck around 40 % leave / 40 % stay . 
  ukip are loud but so are the conservatives and they 're not too fond of the eu either . 
  cameron said he 'd push to leave if he does n't get his reforms and it 's unlikely he 's going to get them . 
  when it comes to africa migration/muslims and / r/europe i kind of give those threads a wide berth . 
  they are resettling 5,000 . 
  you made a throwaway for this ? 
  is there any opposition to this in the us ?
