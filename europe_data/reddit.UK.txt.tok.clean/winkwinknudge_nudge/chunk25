  just where has the eu submitted to the whim of the uk recently ? 
  they can but seems strange how people are so complacent when the polls paint a very different picture . 
  the uk 's membership is anything but certain at this point . 
  but many do . 
   there is no way whatsoever of the uk leaving the eu , this is all just politics and desperate politicians trying to squeeze out a few extra votes . 
  say this despite a poll [ published in the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/19/britain-uncovered-survey-attitudes-beliefs-britons-2015 ) which has a majority wanting to leave ? 
   as things stand , britain would vote to leave the eu if a referendum were held ; 46 % would either `` definitely '' ( 28 % ) or `` probably '' ( 18 % ) vote to leave , while 38 % would `` definitely '' ( 20 % ) or `` probably '' ( 18 % ) vote to remain . 
  wondered when someone was going bring up the empire . 
  surprised it took this long . 
  the uk 's been constructive in many places . 
  i remember the uk saying the right to be forgotten was hard to implement and open to abuse . 
  it was met with `` omg just leave the eu already '' here . 
  do you ? 
  seems she just says most things for the shock factor . 
  if she does n't outrage people what else has she got going for her ? 
  about as popular as yahoo is anywhere ; not very . 
  you mean the guy who said churchill was as much of a bully as hitler was right ? 
  you 're referring to that post ? 
  they probably would though i remember they did n't much like the euro . 
  snp are set on scotland becoming independent . 
  i remember you greatly favoured that . 
   like london , full of shitskins who hate europe . 
  / u/wizzlewazzle69 london is extremely pro-eu/europe ... 
   being an island the uk does n't and never will see itself as proper european , so there is a fair few that want to leave and with the rise of ukip that number is increasing . 
   to put a % to it i think it would only be around 30 % although that may change when the referendum comes . 
  [ support has actually been growing to stay in the eu . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#2015 ) current polling has it at 40 % stay / 39 % to leave . 
  [ yougov which are one of the most accurate had it at 46 % to stay / 36 % to leave just a few weeks ago . 
  ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/02/24/eu-referendum-record-lead/ ) a record high . 
  compare that to last year or 2013 and you can see support for staying has only grown . 
  believe it 's ip based . 
  when i use a swedish vpn i get all their default subs . 
  very little i think . 
  most people in the uk equate the eu with immigration and creeping rules , or at least that 's where the eu gets mentioned . 
  political parties only mention if they plan on having an in/out referendum on eu membership . 
  other than that it 's not mentioned . 
  there 's actually [ a guardian opinion piece ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/17/general-election-europe-uk-exit-absence-debate-nervous ) on the absence of europe/eu being discussed in the debates and election . 
   i once bought juice in london . 
   it was chemically dyed water with artificial orange taste that was n't anything like oranges . 
  i do n't think that stuff even exists in germany . 
  / u/streicheleinheit you bought crappy juice . . that 's the uk 's fault ? 
  i think you do n't know the difference between [ squash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/squash_\\ ( drink \\ ) ) and juice . 
  like i said you 've only yourself to blame . 
  extreme ? 
  it sounds like a pr campaign . 
  funny how greenwald seems to neglect to mention argentina 's invasion and refers to it as :  ` tensions between the two nations , which fought a war over the small archipelago in the south atlantic ocean in 1982 ' also the author lives in brazil who 's the strongest supporter of argentina 's claim of the falklands . 
  denying british ships with falklands flag from docking in brazil , amongst other things . 
   why ? 
  i was talking about brits as in citizens of the uk , of whom some do n't consider themselves european because of this body of water . 
  i do n't understand why you think irish are `` brits '' . 
  / u/das _ schnabeltier why do you think the british made the decision not to be subscribed to / r/europe as default and not the reddit admins ? 
  if you 're eating crappy food you 've only yourself to blame . 
  not sure of the reason but the uk is n't included . 
  when were the polish used as a scapegoat in the uk or ireland ? 
  i remember there was a fuss about the borders opening but was n't that like 10 years ago ? 
  apart from those in the uk , 
  from a quick look at a poll it seems the north of england is more eurosceptic but the numbers are all very close . 
  london being the most pro-eu area of the uk . 
  i highlighted it a bit for easier reading - http://i.imgur.com/ed9pcdy.jpg, 
  london is one of the most pro-eu parts of the uk . 
  [ 40 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#2015 ) of the uk wants to remain in the eu . 
  polls have shown scots * want * a referendum on the eu . 
  do n't think it was would ` awkward ' in the slightest though . 
  not a clue . 
  the amount of coverage he gets on this sub you 'd think he 's next inline for pm . 
  hah criticise the eu ? 
  must be a hardened-ukip supporter ... please / u/limitlessltd ... 
  ** internationalism or isolationism ? 
  ** the chatham house -- yougov survey * british attitudes towards the uk 's international priorities * [ report ] ( http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/field/field_document/20150129yougovraines.pdf ) - pdf warning, 
  well i 'm glad the real world is n't like that then , 
   i 'm sure many british people feel more like australians , and new zealanders then the people across the channel . 
  but that was largely popularised by the simpsons `` cheese eating surrender monkeys '' . 
  what 's that got to do with / u/masterofwhisperers ? 
  the uk 's * constantly * being criticized so it 's nothing new to us . 
  just look at this thread for example . 
   seeing british stuck in the past of nationalism viewing themselves as something better , since when ? 
  the germans see [ themselves as being better by quite a way ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ovs6lfv.png ) . 
  lol downvoted . 
  oh / r/europe ... 
  polls are around 40 % for both prospects so i think the support is there for either . 
  though there are better languages to learn . 
  do n't worry juncker 's just speeded things up a little with the recent block and it 'll likely push the uk out of the eu . 
   we call the french cheese eating surrender monkeys ` we ' ? 
  that was from an episode of the simpsons . 
  i 'm only taking it hard because i replied to someone only to to be met with a few comments along the line of `` heh if you only knew what he really said about you '' . 
   ( and all the more incentive to learn more languages and show those ruddy continentals what 's what , eh ? ), 
  so i can indirectly call people ` island monkey 's ' without them knowing ? 
  yea i 'm going to stick to just replying to english posts . 
  yea i 'll just stick to replying to english only posts from now on . 
  guess i learnt my lesson . 
  i just stupidly thought people were posting the same thing in two languages . 
  while i was replying to one thing they were having a bit of an inside joke about me not understanding their language . 
  i 'd say it 's more snide than anything . 
  banter seems to becoming a bit of a weasel word . 
  `` oh do n't like what i 'm saying ? 
  you ca n't handle banter '' . 
  yup i see that now . 
  naively thought people were being kind and posting verbatim in two languages rather than snide comments . 
  yea i see you 're having your own little conversation now .
