  google gives it as :  achwas , german is also sufficient . 
  is funny but also when the monkey island do not know what 's going on is . 
   did n't realise people were posting crappy things here . 
  pretty disappointing to be honest . 
  i mean i know you do n't like the english but why do you want to alienate those who only speak english ? 
  i 'm judging it based on what languages the british council recommend britons learn based on 10 different criteria . 
   you 're right , german is useless and boring anyway . 
  i never said it was useless or boring . 
  edit : naively thought people were being kind and posting verbatim in two languages rather than snide comments . 
  a handy gift from juncker to ukip . 
   encourage all the british to learn the glorious german language . 
  they really should n't . 
  it 's like the 5th most useful language to learn . 
  edit : i see you 're hiding little comments in your native tongue . 
  naively thought people were being kind and posting verbatim in two languages rather than snide comments . 
  til not being a racist is ` kissing foreigner ass ' . 
  showed them little respect ? 
  he was walking alongside a road . 
  what do you expect him to do ? 
  ca n't believe you 're actually defending their actions ... wow . 
  to make a program on how racist some russians are and it seems he got what he want for . 
  mission accomplished . 
  yes by saying racial slurs at him . 
  they really showed him up ... 
  you actually think he wanted to be attacked ? 
  it 's not splitting hairs at all . 
  you say uk 's banning porn sites . 
  it has n't . 
  you link to something completely unrelated and reply `` oh splitting hairs now '' . 
   can no longer be featured in porn shot in the uk . 
  how 's that the same as banning a porn website which was my question ? 
  not that i actually expect you to reply but what porn sites has the uk blocked ? 
  edit : unsurprisingly getting upvoted for that nonsense though . 
  good job . 
   it 's not like they are ever going through with bailing anyway . 
  how do you mean ? 
  the polls are pretty close . 
  ** 45 % ** stay / ** 41 % ** leave, 
  is there any hope for this ? 
  i remember merkel was pretty much dead set against it . 
   the italian special forces do all the dirty work for nato , like ? 
  and today there 's another ukip candidate saying we should n't invest in cycle lanes because they 're largely used by the young , should be taxed and fitted with a bell . 
  what a party ... 
  also a link to the article would n't go amiss - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8696690.stm, 
  yup . 
  yougov poll :  a plurality of the public now believes that the uk 's closest ties should be to the eu rather than to the us . 
  30 % of the public think that the uk 's closest ties should be to the eu , while 25 % say it should be to the us . 
  this is a reversal of the 2012 figures . 
  a smaller number ( 18 % ) think the uk 's closest ties should be to emerging economies . 
  among opinion-formers , the results were clearer : 56 % chose the eu , with only 25 % selecting the us ( in 2012 , the figures were 46 % to 29 % in the eu 's favour ) . 
   i thought you were anti-eu nope i 'm indifferent . 
  i was just under the incorrect impression one could belong to either independently of the other . 
  you say this despite a majority of public wanting closer ties with the eu than the us ? 
  why ca n't you just ignore it then ? 
   `` the eu is stopping us from our right to spy !, 
  the only solution to keep the country safe is to scrap the echr and leave the eu ... '' etc. 
  what 's the eu got to do with this ? 
  when you stop complaining about the british ... so i guess never ? 
  i 'd say it 's more realistic , than hypocritical . 
  the uk invests in renewable and will hit the 2020 target it set . 
  it 'd be nice to just switch over to renewable overnight but it 's just not realistic . 
  ca n't you extract oil and still be concerned about the environment ? 
  edit : i 'd rather it be left in the ground . 
  better together / u/caledonian _ scot, 
  surely a nuclear chill at the very least ? 
   odds on , probably 75 % of the voters in the uk would chose to stay in the eu and also push for structural reform . 
   35 % to stay 34 % to leave . 
  if there is a referendum cameron said the question will be asked based on reforms he 's managed to secure . 
  this jumps up to 57 % stay / 22 % leave on ` renegotiated terms ' but the chance of renegotiated terms looks slim . 
   yeah let 's put our opinion in the best possible light and misinterpret the opposing side . 
  good reddiquette !, 
   `` hey honey , why did you opt into piss porn with our isp ? '', 
   `` mom , could you please opt out of the piss porn filter ? 
  i 'm gay and i 'd like to visit some sexual health sites ''  `` sup dad !, 
  please shut off the filter !, 
  i want some information on tor , the ccc and the newest leaks '' . 
  `` son , you just want to watch piss porn , do n't you '' if you 're insisting on that stupid argument i can see i 'm wasting my time . 
  considering your later rants about gchq i can see why you 'd view your own interpretation of it as charitable . 
  clearly got your own agenda here . 
  oh you 've jumped over to this thread now . 
   or did you mean no industrial espionage by the gchq ? 
  they know the us does it , so do you really believe the gchq says `` nah !, 
  that 'd be immoral ! '', 
  i 'm sure it 's very convenient for you to use the nsa and gchq interchangeably . 
  considering op was about gchq and all my comments pertain to gchq , i 'm going to stick to just discussing gchq . 
   `` oh i have nothing to hide ! '' . 
  great argument !, 
  you are a treasure trove of lines for propaganda posters . 
  alright then , let 's do this !, 
  pn me all your accounts and the passwords . 
  i 'll provide you with a dropbox you can copy all your hd on . 
  or do you have something to hide ? 
  i never asked him to share anything nor did i ever defend what gchq are doing . 
  you seem to have quite a habit of putting words in people 's mouths . 
  my question was addressed to / u/polymute who was expressing that gchq 's activities had hurt his country . 
  not entirely sure why you think you can answer on his behalf , or attempt to at least . 
  you actually did n't you went off on [ your own tangent ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31uige/passport_exit_checks_begin_at_uk_ports_and_borders/cq56b4m ) about censorship . 
   could see his comment in the context of the censorship coming out of uk lately , which in fact presents a move to control the media and citizens . 
   at least be intellectually honest . 
  this `` nu uh !,
