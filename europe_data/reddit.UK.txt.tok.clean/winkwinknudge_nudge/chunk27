  i never read that '' does n't help anyone , least of all you . 
  i never said i did n't read it . 
  perhaps you should heed your own advice . 
   oh you mean the illegally obtained data about the gchq activity that was declared illegal by the investigatory powers tribunal ? 
  i thought that 's what we 're talking about here . 
   so you 're just completely glossing over the fact where the guardian opted to destroy the data rather than go to court . 
  you seemed to prefer to label it as ` newspaper data ' and gchq destroy it . 
   oh those !, 
  where you basically have to state that you like watch piss porn to get to unfiltered information ? 
  yeah shaming people into self-censoring really is not pushing censorship . 
  no you do n't have to state you like piss porn . 
  you 're not interviewed by anyone and asked to fill out a survey of what kind of kinks/fetish you have . 
  you go to your isp control panel and toggle a switch . 
  that 's it . 
  do n't try and make it into something it is n't . 
  let 's stick to facts . 
   yah , you read the headlines and not the follow-up stories . 
  i 'm the misinformed one . 
  well pretty much all your points were incorrect or a little light on fact . 
   have n't downvoted you yet . 
  but if you ca n't take the downvotes to stand up for what you believe , then better shut it . 
  stand up for what i believe ? 
  i was merely pointing out good reddiquette . 
  last i heard they were asking for [ suggestions 5 months ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jfv5t/what_kind_of_questions_would_you_like_see_in_this/ ) . 
   ( your government surprisingly explicitly does n't provide them - i checked ) . 
  is n't the same as `` the gov does n't collect these figures '' . 
   also , there is industrial espionage . 
  sure there is / u/polymute ... sure there is ...  but i 'm starting to get tired of your pissy attitude to be honest . 
  if you do n't want to argue in good faith we can finish this . 
  i asked you how the uk 's surveillance has hurt * you * . 
  you never gave an answer . 
   ( your government surprisingly explicitly does n't provide them - i checked ) . 
  lol does n't exist ... must be the government preventing the number from being published then ... that 's a joke btw . 
   my concerns about how the uk 's surveillance state hurts us in hungary and the eu ( and basically everybody in the world ) as well ? 
  why do n't you tell me how it has actually hurt you ? 
  i 'd be quite interested in hearing it . 
  what tangible way has it hurt you ? 
   oh , you do n't read the news . 
  now i understand . 
  oh i read the news . 
   how about the gchq supervising the destruction of newspaper data . 
  you mean where gchq said to the guardian you 've got illegally obtained material . 
  you can destroy it now or we 'll take you to court . 
  the guardian decided to destroy it as they knew they 'd likely lose . 
  you can search for it as they 've even wrote that 's exactly how it went down . 
  ` newspaper data ' let 's be honest about what it was . 
   or the obsession with filtering `` obscene porn '' which happens to filter information on how to circumvent filtering and surveillance , or information on politicians you mean the filters which are optional and can be disabled in isp control settings ? 
  you sound like someone who 's ** seriously ** misinformed . 
  edit : the downvote button is n't a ` disagree button ' . 
   that 's the thing . 
  it 's not . 
  then please enlighten me . 
  he was replying to a comment where that person pointed out you 're subjected to passport control when you go from ireland to the uk . 
  he replied with :  ` the uk 's transformation into a surveillance/police state is not far from complete ' . 
  what was his argument ? 
   but that was the less important part of my comment . 
  yes the lie was the less important part ... 
   context of the censorship coming out of uk lately , which in fact presents a move to control the media and citizens . 
  and what censorship would that be ? 
   but no , you interpreted his argument as the simplest version `` checking exiting passports = = police state '' . 
  and you completely misread my comment as you said :  `` someone else is doing stupid shit so we should too ! '' . 
  another nice argument . 
  i love it !, 
  a police state has more attributes than this ! '', 
  you went with the dumb `` hey they 're doing it , so it 's totes fine ! '', 
  which is n't what i said as the uk are n't doing it , which i said in my comment . 
   except they do n't , in practice . 
  just going by what wikipedia says and it said it has been imposed since 1997 . 
   its more surprising that it took another 17 years for the uk to start doing it . 
  from wikipedia they uk are n't doing it . 
  there were plans to in 2008 but they were dropped . 
   that 's not an argument . 
  it 's not an argument . 
  i was pointing out you 're talking rubbish . 
  * ` basically every major city is almost fully covered by cctv in the uk . 
  ' * is nonsense . 
   `` someone else is doing stupid shit so we should too ! '' . 
  another nice argument . 
  i love it !, 
  no accusing the uk of being a police state because someone on here said they check passports when in fact it was the irish started to check passports a long time ago . 
  no if your argument is `` omg uk check passports ?!, 
  shock horror !, 
  police state '' is ridiculous . 
  i forgot that the there 's no possible way that gchq could be watching what * you 're * doing on facebook or your porn habits . 
  it 's not like the internet is worldwide or anything ...  but that does n't change the fact that basically every major city is almost fully covered by cctv in the uk . 
  a commonly repeated nonsense . 
   as long as foreigners do n't join in . 
  huh ? 
  right i forgot cctv footage and ` online activities ' were solely uk things . 
  such police state . 
  thank god cctv , the internet and passport controls do n't exist in hungary , eh ? 
  there 's the common travel area but the irish kind of started to check passports in 1997 . 
   since 1997 , the irish government has imposed systematic identity checks on air passengers coming from the united kingdom and selective checks on sea passengers , and occasional checks on land crossings . 
  more on it here -  http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112700071?opendocument#wru03250, 
  til checking passports = = police state . 
  ignore the facts that it 's the irish who imposed passport checking in 1997 from anyone coming from the uk .

  so they 're excluding nine-eyes and fourteen-eyes too ? 
  of course it 's relevant .
