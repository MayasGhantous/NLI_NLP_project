  source ? 
  recently saw [ this interview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14wy4vh-4bm ) of ed miliband ( labour ) and he comes across pretty well . 
  it 's a light hearted interview but definitely a different side than ` meh ' personified which the media has painted him as . 
  yea . . that happened ... 
  that may never happen then . 
  whether a vote happens is kind of in the air . 
   personally , i can imagine that the transition from an environment where quite a lot can be blamed on some nebulous europe into an environment where such assertions are challenged can be quite shocking . 
  * but i ask again what 's being challenged in the thread ? 
  * i just see it as one big circlejerk around ` they took our jobs ' meme filled with anecdotal stories and generalisations about how they met a british person who they did n't like so all british people are like that . 
  -- the top comment is a joke , a unsurprisingly very unoriginal joke , but a reply from a uk flag saying he 'd like a little border control is met with -46 , and another met with -12 . 
   on a completely serious note , the english immigrants i 've met here tend to be way , way more unpleasant than any romanian or polish person . 
  that garners a whopping +134 . 
  the 9th most-upvoted story [ of all time on this sub ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ngz50/how_brits_feel_about_freedom_of_movement_in_the_eu/ ) is another one about british freedom of movement . 
  -- and maybe i 'm just spending too much time here : p, 
  for better or worse until there 's a eu ref . 
  ukip are n't going to go away . 
   of course . . how did i not see that coming ?? 
  i did n't mean that in a flippant way . 
  i mean it used to bother me what people thought about the uk and i was pretty pro-eu back then but now i 've kind of stopped caring and i 'm indifferent to the eu . 
  i know that if i want a proper discussion that is n't filled with ` they took our jobs ' circlejerk , anecdotal stories or stereotypes , there are better places than this sub for having them . 
  i must be right ? 
   there there , dont worry , the storm will go away . 
  sigh , so oppreseed and bullied . 
  :'( oh i 'm not worried in the slightest . 
  i really could n't care less anymore , 
   oh , poor souls ... victims of xenophobia ... well considering it 's against the rules but it seems they 're rarely enforced . 
   some brits are pointing this out . 
  others voice their understanding for the backlash . 
  do n't misappropriate the latter group . 
  right so there 's no anti-uk sentiment here then ... it 's just a completely understandable and valid ` backlash ' . 
   personally , i can imagine that the transition from an environment where quite a lot can be blamed on some nebulous europe into an environment where such assertions are challenged can be quite shocking . 
  nothing is being challenged here . 
  the comments are full of : * `` i was once on a bus and this british person did n't speak my language . 
  fuck all british people and their island mentality for not speaking my language '' . 
  * what 's being challenged in the comments posted here ? 
  edit : also the 4th most-upvoted story of the week . 
  right there 's absolutely no anti-uk sentiment here then ... all the british people here pointing it out are just deluded . 
   i 've honestly no idea why some brits feel like they do n't belong in the european community really ? 
  have you read this thread ? 
  some european community ... 
  725 votes now . 
  currently the 5th most-upvoted story of the week . 
  impressive stuff for a 1year old article . 
  when [ this was posted in this sub last year ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1xie46/two_million_british_people_emigrated_to_eu/ ) it actually makes for better reading , certainly less hostile . 
  i 'm not ukip at all but you 're not the first to make that mistake . 
  and the line between here and / r/yurop grows ever more blurred . 
  well if i ever needed evidence that everyone is better than the british this anecdotal story confirms it . 
   two million votes in the eu would be crucial in a uk referendum . 
  3.1 % of the uk 's population . 
  i 'm not sure that 's a ` crucial ' amount . 
  welcome to / r/europe . 
   what pisses me off is its using its privileged position to spy on the eu at the behest of the us . 
  despite many eu agencies collaborating with gchq/nsa ? 
  or that the guardian said germany now depends on us/uk intel ? 
  love how this sub always ignores it when it 's anyone other than uk or us . 
  i ca n't think of many subs which once had a ` satirical ' news item of `` look how ugly british people are '' . 
  any spying stuff and it 's `` oh let 's kick the uk out '' but when it 's any other country it [ barely ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31je56/how_the_german_foreign_intelligence_agency_bnd/ ) gets a [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2z7ypt/norways_police_security_service_pst_persistently/ ) on here . 
  if you were an englishmen it got pretty hairy around the scottish indy ref when everyone seemed to be under the impression the scottish were under a tyrannical regime . 
  it 's pretty anti-uk here . 
  -- edit : oh look at yet another anti-uk circlejerk thread [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31lgpd/two_million_british_people_emigrated_to_eu/ ) :, 
   i would even think the dominos would come crashing down if you guys leave , i 'm not so sure . 
  even a couple of years ago hollande was saying europe would be ok without the uk . 
  i doubt they 're worried about it . 
  there 've been a couple of articles in the [ last ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/313wpy/clinging_to_power_does_the_uk_still_matter/ ) few days outlining how the uk 's withdrawn from the world stage and from the eu . 
  one of the many criticisms people have of the uk is that it 's half-out/half-in the eu and not fully invested . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-30/merkel-seeks-spy-pact-as-german-delegation-goes-to-white-house it was a widely circulated quote . 
  also appears on : http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/29/clapper-contradicts-white-house-says-obama-was-awa/?page=all http://news.sky.com/story/1161504/us-spy-chief-quotes-casablanca-to-defend-nsa http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10422998/the-spying-game-europe-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-us-intelligence-disclosures.html http://www.cnet.com/news/intelligence-chief-clapper-cites-casablanca-in-dismissing-merkel-mess/, 
  could n't really care less what russia wants . 
  decision lies within the uk . 
  though i do n't see what advantage the uk leaving would have for russia . 
  the uk 's barely involved in any meaningful way in the eu and said it wants no part in an eu army . 
  * though * on the other hand i often hear here that the uk 's trying to destroy the eu from the inside so i guess in that case russia would want the uk to stay within the eu . 
   what if there were right-wing groups receiving money from russia for advocating a split-up ? 
  is that the case ? 
  i 've not heard of it .

  it 's all very confusing . 
  yea but that 's nothing new :  clapper ( director of national intelligence james clapper ) said spying on allied leaders goes both ways and compared the european reaction to a scene in the film `` casablanca , '' in which a french official feigns shock to discover gambling in the cafe owned by humphrey bogart 's character . 
   `` my god , there 's gambling going on here , '' clapper told the u.s. legislators . 
  `` you know , it 's the same kind of thing . '' i remember she really was n't that bothered until it was her personal phone . 
  i was replying to an american who was grabbing popcorn . 
  i can assure you it was n't random . 
   lol , hey guys we had to fudge up another list because america was too high sorry , but do you think i 'm responsible for collecting this data and the report it 's based on ? 
   just like how we like to say per capita charity is more important than total charity in which america gives multiples more than the next nation on the list , but per capita it 's less , because quantity somehow does n't matter ? 
  do you just want to turn this into some sort of pissing contest ? 
  cool your jets , fella . 
  ihdi ( inequality-adjusted hdi ) and the us drops to [ 28th ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_hdi ) . 
  i 'll wait a couple of days and make a thread `` dae want a eu federation ? '', 
  and reap the karma , 
  would n't expect much to come of it but good luck with it .
