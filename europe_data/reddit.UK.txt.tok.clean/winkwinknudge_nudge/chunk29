  you get freedom of movement regardless of being in the schengen area . 
   did you not watch bennett 's answer on that ? 
  did n't watch it and was going on what people have previously said . 
  thought it was unlikely the greens would hence i said ` doubt ' , 
   they all seem to want to have an eu referendum . 
  you say this despite labour specifically saying they wo n't have a referendum ? 
  doubt the ~ ~ greens ~ ~ nor libdem would offer one either . 
   i 'm not staying on this side of the channel if that happens ... 
  sorry you 're not a fan of a democracy . 
  karma for what ? 
   oh look , it 's that thread again !, 
  [ again ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30dg90/europeans_of_reurope_do_you_think_that_the_uk/cprec5g ) , you 're not forced to reply to a thread if you do n't like it . 
  [ #leadersdebate ] ( https://twitter.com/hashtag/leadersdebate?src=hash ) is the hashtag . 
  huh ? 
  it 's a terrible website . 
  why do you think it has the little circle with a line through it next to it on here :p, 
  why not just link to the original [ guardian piece ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/27/francis-maude-warned-by-scientists-over-chilling-effect-of-new-media-rules ) ? 
   uk clinging to us over eu is like a kid clinging to the biggest bully ( world hegemon is inherently a bully , i do n't mean anything negative by that ) in the schoolyard hoping to get benefits out of the relationship . 
  though this has recently changed ( but only barely ) :  a plurality of the public now believes that the uk 's closest ties should be to the eu rather than to the us . 
  30 % of the public think that the uk 's closest ties should be to the eu , while 25 % say it should be to the us . 
  this is a reversal of the 2012 figures . 
   maybe if you 're not man enough to troll around without trying to muzzle opposition with facile appeals to moderator intervention , you should probably be browsing / r/aww . 
   either way , i do n't care . 
  well you seemed to care enough to reply . 
  i think he * may * have been sarcastic . 
  i think a different perspective on things is always good . 
   i 'm not sure if i can live with myself knowing i am a rule violator . 
  well i mean if you ca n't have a discussion without refraining from personal attacks maybe it 's not for you . 
  well if you 're going to post here you might as well abide by the rules . 
   is an apologist for mass surveillance . 
  he posts articles calling for the backdooring of encryption , which any it specialist in the field , including yours truly , finds unacceptable in the extreme . 
  i submitted ** [ a single news ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30on0z/europol_chief_warns_on_computer_encryption/ ) ** article about the chief of europol saying encryption was a problem . 
  you said i supported everything he said and called me a shill . 
  not sure why you keep resorting to these personal attacks . 
  they add nothing to the discussion and are against the [ rules ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30ulo9/reurope_has_an_amazing_new_shiny_revised_set_of/ ) / u/traime, 
  it 's cool . 
  i 'm told remaining in the eu makes the uk matter . 
  the french ( dgse ) already share data with the nsa/gchq . 
   `` dgse are a highly motivated , technically competent partner , who have shown great willingness to engage on ip [ internet protocol ] issues , and to work with gchq on a `` cooperate and share '' basis . '', 
  / r/europe likes to ignore anyone but the nsa/gchq . 
  it makes a compelling argument . 
  eu army is still on though ... right guys ... ? 
  re-post : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30ors4/neonazi_tries_to_set_fire_to_eu_flag_but_falls/, 
   dude have u seen tge bbc so called doco the romanians are coming ? 
  that was n't the bbc ... that was [ channel 4 ] ( http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-romanians-are-coming ) . 
   this is a sort of social control which is at the border of a dictatorship . 
  yeah ... you need to look up what a dictatorship is . 
  in the article it does say the uk spent # 12m on fences and more security but the mayor was annoyed it was n't spent on the towns image . 
  that 's asking far too much, 
   you did sign that too btw . 
  do n't believe * i * did . 
    is it ? 
  it says `` ever closer union '' . 
  time to start . 
  sure ... and i 'm positive no one will have any problems with the eu even becoming more german-franco-centric . . non at all . . 
  ` real union ' is n't that the eu ? 
  because franco-german does n't dominate the eu enough already ? 
  what would be the advantages of such a move ? 
  nope the [ bbc actually froze ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11572171 ) it for 6 years in 2010 . 
   cameron is wholly pro-eu and will campaign vigorously for staying in . 
  would n't that depend on what ` reforms ' he 's able to get ? 
   the referendum will endorse staying in by an easy margin . 
  currently sits at 46 % remain 36 % leave . 
  britons pays a license fee of 16.60 euros a month ... 
   yeah , but then the british could watch german tv1 without paying our ( considerably higher ) license fees . 
  and how much is that ? 
  someone in this thread said it 's 18 euro 's a month if that 's true it 's only 1 euro more than the uk 's license fee . 
  i really ca n't be bothered to get into a discussion about what the intent of a trailer is for . 
  i hated the new avengers film ... well i have n't seen it but i saw the 2 minute trailer . 
  i think the point of a trailer is to peak your interest in the subject not to allow you to make a judgement on whether the full-length thing is good . 
  such as ? 
  quite something to say a program produced by german-franco channel arte and the bbc , written by ex-economist journalist and reviewed as being factually correct by the financial times ( 4/5 stars ) as being ` propaganda ' . 
  judging a 1hr30 min film based on 2 mins seems a little unfair . 
  great contribution to the discussion . 
  keep up the great work . 
   who cares what you say ? 
  i say it 's reasonable at this point . 
   then why bother even replying to me ? 
  go pester somebody else . 
  posting a news article does n't mean i 'm defending it . 
  that 's idiotic . 
  like i said labelling * me * a ` shill ' ( very original ) because i disagree with you is ridiculous . 
  edit : you actually created a sub called ' / r/shilldefense ' ... wow . 
  i can see you have some affinity for using the term . 
  indeed - https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=ttip&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all, 
   the parties start hiring private companies making propaganda like this and every single time it is about hitler references . 
  so you 're accusing arte and the bbc of producing propaganda ? 
  did you actually watch it ? 
   britain would never go along with it but i 'd rather they issue a definite statement towards the eu anyway . 
  they do n't want to be a part of a unified europe they do n't have to but do n't halfass it and make it worse for those who want . 
  the uk 's already said they do n't want any part of an eu military . 
  second link down - https://www.youtube.com/results?filters=long&amp;search_query=great+european+disaster+movie&amp;lclk=long, 
  it was posted shortly after it [ aired . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xp42v/the_great_european_disaster_movie_bbc_made/ ) i was surprised more people were n't interested in it . 
  i 've not defended it , i merely do n't subscribe to the level of hostility you do . 
  referring to the us or uk as rogue states similar to china or russia ... `` we should emancipate ourselves as mainland europeans from the russians , the british , the chinese and the americans . '', 
  and labelling anyone you disagree with as a ` shill ' is pretty silly , / u/traime, 
   but that is unacceptable to the eu however , so its either in or out ; and polls are fairly even on that . 
  its all just down to who wins the elections imo . 
  though merkel has slapped him down , cameron said he wants to limit it and it seems the british public do too .
