  you 've said you hope the uk leaves the eu . 
  * snipped * it 's hard to say as there 's no possibility of knowing the uk/eu relation if it does leave the eu . 
  sorry , but it ` tanking ' is doubtful though . 
   without `` services '' , what has the uk got to offer ? 
  yea it 's not like the uk is the 6th largest manufacturer by volume , second largest aerospace industry , second largest defence contractor , a leading pharmaceutical industry , automotive manufacturing . 
  no we 're all bankers of course . 
   it 's the uk . 
  that kind of stuff happens here now . 
  sure it does / u/shitfacephil . 
  sure it does . 
  where does it say anything , even alluding to that ? 
   i love the uk , and i consider they are our biggest military ally , but cameron is a big fat phony hypocrit , bitching about france like a self-righteous american televengelist about the sale of two helicopter-carriers of negligible importance , while the uk was still trading weapons with russia in bigger deals . 
  and that 's the core of the problem . 
  with regards to the uk/russia weapons . 
   of the contracts granted , however , only 31 were worth more than # 1m . 
  of these , just one -- a # 1.6 m small arms deal -- was for anything actually capable of killing anyone . 
   despite downing street reassurances that no licences were granted for equipment to support russia 's military -- the exports were all for civilian and commercial use -- mps have expressed concern . 
  ...  on face value , few of the licences read like they matter much to the kremlin 's military machine , with its $ 81bn annual budget . 
  during the past 12 months , for example , the uk granted the export of # 480 worth of semiconductor chemicals , and # 6,261 of swimming equipment . 
   even when it comes to more sophisticated technology , the buyers have not been particularly belligerent organisations . 
  night-vision goggles were sold to students for a college project , said number 10 , while small shipments of guns went for sporting purposes . 
   if anything , the state of uk weapons exports to russia shows how little moscow relies on foreign powers for its military prowess . 
  since 2000 , the kremlin has signed only 10 arms contracts of any significance with other nations . 
  [ financial times ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d2ad14c6-1284-11e4-a6d4-00144feabdc0.html ) i 'm sure it 's very convienent to see the sale of two helicopter-carriers as of `` negligible importance '' while complaining about the sale of # 1.6 m of small arms . 
   like i said , this was not the first case of these `` rape gangs '' , but they do tent to go underreported and underplayed in the media , because of what i would assume to be a narrative preserving and political reason , unreported ? 
  [ there 's been a story about rotheram on / r/europe ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=rotherham+&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) alone , at least once a day . 
  curiously most submitted by you . 
  i really would n't talk about some sort of establishment trying to preserve a narrative and a political reason and then link to a pdf from a site which is blaming it all on the muslims and has to * explicitly mention * they 're not affiliated with the edl . 
  ca n't you just keep this kind of nonsense over in / r/european ? 
  i mean you have submitted it there already and numerous other subreddits . 
  you just need to hit whiterights and you 'd have a full house ( though as / u/scoonmahook points out it 's already on whiterights ), 
  until the nato summit is over to take the heat of hollande 's back . 
  wtf man ? 
  come on . . 
  i 've reported it for what it 's worth . 
  but that 's assuming a lot of events happen before then . 
  which would effectively mean scotland has no monetary policy as it 'd be linked to the bank of england . 
  the euro area has shown what difficulties that can bring about . 
  there 'd also be no lender of last resort for commercial banks . 
  the banking sector is incredibly more complicated than that of 1922 when ireland retained sterling . 
  they 'd probably not meet the reserve requirement for banks so they 'd have to buy sterling reserves . 
  not sure people would trust it much * if they do go independent * , without a currency union and default on uk debt . 
  when a uk/eu vote is n't even certain yet ? 
  edit : i see i 'm being downvoted already . 
  the echo chamber is strong today . 
  your friends are idiots . 
  edit : / u/rsashe1980 why 'd you delete it ? 
  and what difference does that make ? 
   they are saying that the uk will leave the eu , it 's uncertain if there will even be a uk/eu referendum and [ polls are far too close . 
  ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#opinion_polling ) 41 % to stay , 40 % to leave . 
   oh shut the front door with that nonsense , this has nothing to do with race it only has to do with the failure of certain groups to integrate into mainstream society . 
  how 's it nonsense ? 
  * it is * posted in whiterights . 
  i never even said anything about race nor multiculturalism , it 's success or failure . 
  this really is nonsense and as is said in the video , * it 's an online poll * . 
  completely unscientific and of course open to abuse . 
  who on earth is upvoting this nonsense ? 
  it 's kind of sad this subreddit is getting the same stuff that 's being posted in the likes of whiterights ... 
  you can - [ living in sweden - gov.uk ] ( https://www.gov.uk/living-in-sweden )  as an eu/eea citizen , you have the right to live and work in sweden provided that you can support yourself , either by work or by other independent means . 
   if you intend to stay longer than three months in sweden you will need to register your right of residence in sweden and apply for a swedish id-number . 
  ** note ** : it may seem you do n't actually need to apply for residence according to [ sweden 's london embassy site ] ( http://www.swedenabroad.com/en-gb/embassies/london/work--live-in-sweden/live-in-sweden1/ ) . 
  i 'm not clear on it . 
   as an eu citizen you have the right to work , study or live in sweden without a residence permit . 
   if you can support yourself , you automatically have right of residence in sweden and do not need to contact the swedish migration board . 
  there 's an extensive list here : [ help for british nationals living overseas ] ( https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/living-abroad/help-for-british-nationals-living-overseas ) . 
  just look for articles `` living in x '' as there 's pretty much one for every country . 
  the gov.uk can be a pretty great resource .

  it 's a common opinion here in / r/europe of wanting to the uk to leave the eu .

  at least david cameron hopes the uk stays in ... 
   at this point , i honestly want them out . 
  they 're causing so much trouble for the rest of the eu that it 's not worth it . 
  what trouble are you talking about specifically ?

  it 's quite funny to this story being dragged up in / r/europe over the last couple of days .

  well it 'd be a pretty public loss in russia if it was removed from them . 
  you 'd hope russia 's public would start to question putin but they seem second only to kim jong un with regards to their affection for their leader . 
  not really eu but nato are creating a new unit of 10,000 led by britain :  the force will incorporate air and naval units as well as ground troops and will be led by british commanders , with other participating nations contributing a range of specialist troops and units . 
  countries involved at present include denmark , latvia , estonia , lithuania , norway and the netherlands . 
  canada has also expressed an interest in taking part . 
  [ nato states create new multilateral force ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5335d904-2f98-11e4-87d9-00144feabdc0.html ), 
   my major concern is that if we do n't vote for independence , those plans will be vastly stunted by uk spending cuts . 
  scotland already receives something like 28 % of uk renewable energy subsidy ( # 560m / $ 707m ) , but equates to only 10 % of energy sales . 
  how would independence save scotland 's energy plans ?
