  funny considering it 's often seen as one of the big advantages of being in the eu . 
  did read somewhere : ` freedom of movement is something that happens to the british , not something they do . ', 
   i would wager negative opinion of the uk has to do with politics . 
  the gchq revelations probably had a strong effect . 
  that does n't mean there 's a negative view of british people . 
  which is actually pretty funny as the guardian mentioned the bnd are now completely reliant on nsa/gchq intelligence . 
  germany have played it really well . 
  kicking up a fuss in public while depending on them behind the scenes . 
  best of both worlds . 
   and still keep free movement of labour for eu citizens . 
  that 's even if the uk want it to begin with . 
  last poll i saw had 49 % vs. 26 % wanting to limit freedom of movement ( as well as limiting their own rights of movement in the eu ) . 
  david cameron mentioned it but there was no law and nothing became of it . 
   do either , but bloody decide already . 
  you do know there 's likely to be a referendum on it ? 
   regardless , why would you care what random redditors say/think anyway ? 
  never said i * cared * . 
  i would n't say so no . 
  if you 're from the uk this place really is n't very welcoming in the least . 
  usually follows : - stay in the eu - stay in the eu and shut up moaning - stay in the eu and have to join the euro and schengen - leave the eu because we 're stopping integration - leave the eu because we 're trying to destroy the eu from inside - leave the eu because we 're the us ' 51st state . 
  - leave the eu and be punished by the eu for leaving, 
  because being in the eu prevents invasions now ? 
  http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/media/38921/bsa32_ukip.pdf in the full report . 
   ukip supporters have quite a distinctive social profile . 
  as table 1 shows , ukip support is more than twice as high among those aged 55 and over ( 12 % ) as it is among those who are less than 35 ( 5 % ) . 
  equally , the party 's support is twice as high among those in more working class occupations ( 11 % ) than it is among those in ( typically ) salaried managerial and professional positions ( 5 % ) . 
  there is also relative enthusiasm for ukip among small employers and the selfemployed ( 11 % ) . 
  the group among whom ukip is least popular is graduates , only 3 % of whom say that they support the party . 
  in contrast support is around three times as high ( 11-12 % ) among those whose highest educational qualification is an o level or its equivalent .

  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14zypr/are_there_any_europeans_sympathetic_to_british/ ) uk ( england specifically ) is n't really seen in a positive light on this sub so i would n't expect too much . 
   they seem removed from reality and have this arrogance towards other europeans . 
  citation needed . 
   touting about national sovereignty this and that but then going very awkward when scotland almost leaves ( oh how ironic that seemed to me then ) . 
  scotland had the chance to be independent and they rejected it with a vote . 
  what was awkward about it ? 
   ` we should focus on the rest of the world and our old commonwealth ' crap maybe not india but commonwealth countries are seen * extremely * favourable in the uk so it makes sense british people would like to have a closer connection with them . 
  it does n't really seem like you 're that torn on the issue . 
  but i 'm not the one complaining , 
  you 're not forced to comment on it . 
  there are reasons to leave , whether you agree with them or not is another thing entirely . 
   clarkson is infinitely more involved than most presenters ( owning a production company that produces top gear for example ) . 
   he is n't . 
  he sold his share to the bbc a couple of years ago . 
   because they did n't tolerate far worse for decades ? 
  and that prevents them from making better choices ? 
  not sure . 
  he 's [ crashed it ] ( https://i.imgur.com/sycvgal.jpg ) a few times . 
  bbc owns topgear and the format . 
  jeremy clarkson sold his share a few years ago for # 14m i think . 
  well you seem to be painting the guy who got punched as the bad guy . 
  yea damn him for getting hit because jeremy clarkson could n't find any food . 
  punching someone is funny ? 
  says the guy with a broomstick . 
  you should probably read my comments a little closer rather than making things up and assumptions about me / u/traime, 
   it does n't seem fair that the uk can dictate to scotland ( should we leave ) that we are leaving and therefore so are they . 
  which is why i said another push for independence seems fair ... 
   sometimes american pilots kill civilians . 
  sometimes drones blow up weddings . 
  it happens too often . 
  but there is a real difference between accidental damage and deliberately targeting minorities or civilians . 
  that 's a little rich . 
  when the us kills people it 's ` accidental ' ? 
  guess it helps when you classify anyone and everyone as ` militants ' . 
  you should really look into your drone program . 
  [ 41 men targeted but 1,147 people killed . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/24/-sp-us-drone-strikes-kill-1147 ) that 's looks less like ` accidental ' and more like acceptable collateral damage . 
  i mean is n't the us practically violating human rights with the likes of torture , abu ghraib , gitmo amongst others ? 
  i would n't be so quick to try and take the high moral ground on this . 
   yeah ... so it 's because you are black ... well apparently i 'm a ` dog ' . 
  and like i said originally , people here love to hate the uk . 
  some criticism deserved , some not-so-much . 
   `` dogs '' is the general term the spanish empire used to refer to the english . 
  that 's history in that comment . 
  which you completely forgot to mention and [ went ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2oy7hp/does_your_country_have_any_nicknames_to_tease_its/cmrx0gn ) with the present-tense :  we call the english `` dogs '' . 
  -  that 's the two only comments you can find . 
  hah no ... 
  pretty much all your comments follow a similar pattern of : - '' [ as ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jokj2/bbc_news_eu_exit_would_reduce_british_influence/cldms8p ) long as the british are n't in it '' . ', 
  - '' [ let ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jokj2/bbc_news_eu_exit_would_reduce_british_influence/cldmxex ) the brits face alone their decay . '', 
  - '' [ oh ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2c4cca/eu_sanctions_on_russia_agreed_putting_city_of/cjc25ts ) no !,

'', 
   they are always on subject . 
  if you have read the news for the last two years you could imagine why the uk is not getting any sympathy . 
   i raise my case , there are reason for legitimate criticism towards the uk government . 
  it 's not just because you are black . 
  and my original comment was `` this sub loves to hate the uk '' . 
  i never asked nor expected sympathy , and certainly not from here . 
  for someone who sees the uk as irrelevant you do spend a lot of your time talking about it . 
   lol . 
  whatever ... nice you keep blind about what your government has been doing . 
  nearly everyone of your comments is moaning about the uk . 
  referring to them as ` dogs ' , ` thieves ' . 
   keep blind about what your government has been doing . 
  and what would that be ? 
   for no reason of course , all just out of the blue . 
  just looked at your post history so i 'll just save my breath . 
  glad you 've managed to make a hobby out of moaning about the uk though .
