  well considering this poll makes no mention of what they 're defining as ` the left ' then that 's true . 
  why not throw a couple of your usual ` britbongs ' in there while you 're at it / u/donvito ? 
  why ban it ? 
  i 'd hope it 's more than because it 's a eu-sceptic outlet ... 
  nope not a huge deal at all . 
  57 upvotes and 20 comments on this story alone seems pretty good . 
  i 'm sure it 'll be re-submitted a couple of times more in the next few days . 
   if we do decide to leave the eu , i feel it 'll be the final push for independence . 
  that seems fair . 
  does n't seem right that scotland could be able to dictate that the rest of the uk should remain in the eu . 
  your loss is the uk 's gain i guess . 
   remember the shit storm about switzerland selling 190m $ worth of camouflage nets to russia ? 
  will the uk get the same amount of shit for this ? 
  i doubt it . 
  / u/chrisixx sure it will . 
  this story has been submitted * 3 * times in the last 24 hours . 
  this sub loves to hate the uk . 
  the uk got a ton of crap for selling stuff to russia which turned out to largely be civil grade stuff and much of it going to universities for research . 
  thanks / u/aando . 
  always good to see migration getting a mention in * every * uk thread here . 
  that never gets old . 
  it 's behind a paywall on the sunday times ' site but i found the full thing on his [ facebook page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/davidcameronofficial/posts/954500114574307 ) . 
  fair enough . 
  be interesting to see if england votes to leave and scotland votes to stay . 
  though i guess there may not even be a referendum .

  how so ? 
  i meant relatively to how often it 's brought up here . 
  then you 'll fit right in with the rest of this sub . 
   what would you care ? 
  you 're not targeted yet : you 're an obedient citizen using your ever diminishing freedom of expression to ridicule the messenger . 
  there 's really no need to be so hostile / u/traime . 
  i do n't care for the ridiculous comparisons or faux outrage i see and when people start crying about xbox kinect or siri it kind of trivialises it . 
  i 'm much more concerned about what my gov is doing rather than the latest gadget . 
  i ca n't opt-out of the gov but i can decide not to buy a samsung tv . 
   in most other western democracies legislation like this would be easily challenged in the courts , but our institutions are ancient and powerful . 
  it * is * being challenged in the courts and this news has been released because of that . 
  i 've heard one too many ridiculous comparisons to 1984 so i approach anything like this with a large amount of skepticism now . 
  right ... the uk 's totally becoming an authoritarian/semi-dictatorship like russia . 
  / s edit : nice . 
  i 'm being downvoted and the guy below who did n't even bother to read the article is being upvoted . 
   the nordics , uk and germany ? 
  some of those are least likely to support federalization . 
  - country | for | against -- | -- | -- germany | 42 % | 38 % uk | 21 % | 48 % denmark | 17 % | 74 % finland | 16 % | 74 % sweden | 15 % | 74 %, 
  while this subreddit likes to talk about it a lot , in the real world federalisation has only [ 41 % of europeans supporting it and 34 % disagreeing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n7wchfg.png ) with the idea .

   internationally , the bnd , germany 's foreign intelligence service , is viewed as less than vigorous . 
  in the secret war on terror , the germans are said to be dependent on signals intelligence from the british and the americans . 
  seems they 've [ become ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/03/british-refusal-cooperate-spy-inquiry-row-germany ) reliant on nsa/gchq . 
  that 's quite a leap on your part from him saying he feels closer to them and you implying he wants the british empire back . 
  downvotes are supposed to be for that but nearly everyone just uses them as an `` agree/disagree '' button .

  why bring nationality into this ? 
  edit : hurr durr british not european . 
  better ? 
   this sub ? 
  yeah this sub . 
  anything which is negative or critical of the eu is typically downvoted quickly . 
  sometimes it 's hard to tell the difference between this sub and / r/yurop . 
  i 'll let you know when it happens .

  well apparently we 've gone ` full retard ' so what do i know ... 
   in its report the home affairs select committee of mps said the act should be changed to make it clear these procedures would be a criminal offence if done on girls under 18 , unless for mental or physical health reasons . 
  yes must n't have a thread here about the uk that does n't some how get dragged into being about immigrants . 
  good job / u/hyperthron !, 
   agreed but the proposal here ban it for adult which is a problem / u/zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzspaf the age you become a legal adult in the uk ( england , northern ireland , wales ) is 18 and this specifically bans it for anyone * under * the age of 18 . 
  how is this banning it for adults ? 
  i think they do when it 's banned * specifically * for under-18 's . 
  just as there 's an age for consensual sex , there 's an age for this . 
  do people here bother reading the article or just the headline ? 
   way to go full retard uk . 
  why ? 
  they 've banned it for anyone under the age of 18 ; just as there 's an age for consensual sex . 
  seems most here did n't bother reading the article and just went into their typical rant about the uk . 
  it 's pretty standard for / r/europe now it seems . 
  but those are all relative to * now * . 
  you can look at any empire through history and they could make a similar claim . 
  ` we 're by far the most successful country in history . ', 
  is a bit much . 
  i know this is a bit pointless though as you seem a * tad * patriotic and are not going to change your thinking . 
   we 're by far the most successful country in history . 
  and how are you measuring that ? 
   we are n't very well liked by them at all , hah . 
  where are we ( britons ) liked to begin with ? 
   and that 's why i 'd love to see the uk leave the eu . 
  because there 's already 9-eyes ( denmark , france , the netherlands and norway ) and 14-eyes ( sseur ) ( germany , belgium , italy , spain and sweden ) ? 
  eu does n't have an army . 
   choose to partner between eu or uk they would choose you ? 
  why would then need to choose one over the other ? 
  why could n't they cooperate with both ? 
  they were watching porn at work . 
  just what about that do you think 's acceptable ? 
  i stuck to british bands at least . 
  thinking everyone should speak english is wrong but so is the snooty attitude and looking down on people who are n't bilingual . 
  people adapt when there 's a need .
