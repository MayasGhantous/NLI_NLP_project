  right now there 's no need to learn a language for most . 
  funny to see me being downvoted and a general snooty attitude towards people who are n't polyglots . 
  oh i get there are good health reasons but for the majority of britons there 's no * need * to learn another language . 
  the eurobarometer finds that english is by far the most useful and what people are learning . 
  your original comment was ' * brits appeared saying they should n't need to learn anything beyond english . 
  * ' and english being as ubiquitous as it is , it 's entirely dependant on their goals but for the majority there 's no need . 
   a lot of brits appeared saying they should n't need to learn anything beyond english . 
  and is n't that true ? 
  why do they * need * to learn another language ? 
  edit : the downvote button is n't a ` disagree button ' .

  noting the lack of comments here . 
  guess it 's because this is n't the nsa/gchq ? 
  can i ask why french ? 
  how come you 're completely ignoring any of the european based spy agencies , their activities or that they collaborate with the nsa/gchq ? 
  hardly seems fair . 
  love how people on this subreddit turn a blind eye to their activities or the lower levels like nine-eyes ( denmark , france , the netherlands and norway ) and fourteen-eyes ( sseur ) ( germany , belgium , italy , spain and sweden . ) . 
  oh , the big bad us and uk again !, 
  how typical to bemoan the nsa/gchq but it was revealed last week that pretty much germany 's entire intelligence operation relies on data from them . 
  and really you do n't consider the uk to be part of europe ? 
  but i 'm always told germany does n't lead the eu ? 
   while the uk - although pretending to be involved - is getting closer to leave while [ polls ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/02/24/eu-referendum-record-lead/ ) show record support for membership . 
  45 % would vote to remain in the european union , while 35 % would vote to leave . 
  honestly this subreddit has a pretty warped perspective of the uk , where i see daily comments where people think farage and co. will become pm . 
   well , that seems to be the way of the british tabloids . 
  you read a lot of them then ? 
  how exactly are you ` letting the uk ' and what can you possibly do about it ? 
  how come you 're reading the daily mail ? 
   keep your restrictions but please shut up . 
  yes how dare the news report on things !, 
  also due to eu law the restrictions ca n't be kept . 
   so why do you accept them then , and blame it on romania ? 
  it 's a little thing called ` freedom of movement ' . 
  the uk had a lot of news about it when the restrictions were lifted for bulgaria and romania but you moaned about the news coverage too . 
  i heard your politicians were offended by it and were writing letters to channel 4 . 
  apart from that ? 
   how about a `` fuck the u.k '' coin to balance things out ? 
   why ? 
  no doubt such a coin would be popular here but the design was submitted by belgium . 
  though the uk has said it has no intentions of joining any eu army . 
  he 's just echoing the cebr model which predicted that the uk would overtake germany in 2030 . 
  [ guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/26/britain-europe-top-economy-by-2030 ), 
   juncker was specifically told not to campaign in the uk by the labour party . 
  / u/tebee no they told martin schulz not to campaign in the uk :  ed miliband , the labour leader , has declined to support schulz , and labour has told him not to campaign for his party of european socialists ( pes ) in britain . 
   not in the schengen space and not in the eurozone . 
  yet there are a few other members who 've secured opt-outs but they do n't seem to get the same hate that the uk receives over it . 
   we do not like the polls saying that british would stay in exchange for renegotiating their position with yet another special place . 
  europe is not a restaurant with any meal you want . 
  the polls do n't show that . 
  the last poll which favoured remaining were without any renegotiated terms . 
  looks like it has stalled - https://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_pop_totl&amp;idim=country:deu:fra:gbr&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en, 
   no , criticize ukip as an example of intransigence in britain . 
   why ? 
  they 're the only party which are giving people who want to be out of the eu a voice . 
   there 's a difference between not being yes men and being petty obstructionists who make everything harder . 
  probably for the best when the uk leaves then . 
   so farage can achieve his wet dream ? 
  no thanks . 
  i think a population deciding if it wants to be in the eu is a little bigger than farage . 
  also i think brown is a little optimistic ; juncker said he had no intention of visiting the uk when he was running for commissioner , i doubt he 'll bother now . 
   that the true patriotic course for britain is not just to engage but to lead in europe -- with progressive british values to the fore . 
  i can imagine the furor of anger this would cause in europe and here . 
  in the last couple of days i 've had a dozen or so replies telling me the uk should leave the eu and i remember a poll which said germany and france saw the uk being in the eu as a negative thing . 
  he should probably look at europe an see they 're not too keen on the uk remaining , let alone leading . 
  not really . 
  the uk have already said they wo n't be participating . 
  many euroskeptics are seeing it as a bit of a win as they can spin it as a creeping eu looking for more powers . 
  lots of pro-eu see it as giving ammunition to the anti-eu crowd . 
   no country depending largely on financial service should do such a forecast . 
  / u/pfdwxenon the uk did n't make this forecast but the centre for economic and business research did in 2013 . 
  [ guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/26/britain-europe-top-economy-by-2030 ) & [ cebr ] ( http://www.cebr.com/reports/world-economic-league-table-2015/ ), 
   they 're also who britons gave the most ep seats to , i think it 's pretty valid to criticize the uk for that . 
   criticise people for voting ? 
   it 's not a terrible thing to not want to be in the eu , but britain needs to shit or get off the can . 
  last poll had a majority of people wanting to remain in the eu . 
   better to be out than to be in and make everything harder to run . 
  make it harder to run ? 
  it 's sad when people only want the eu filled with yes men . 
   you 're not the first to say that . 
   does n't surprise in the slightest . 
  i see you 're true to your username then . 
  it 's cool , as someone who used to be pro-eu i 'm coming around to the idea of leaving . 
  and you guys will probably be rid of us ( the uk ) soon enough , 
  well that 's ukip ; they 're not interested in constructive criticism or bettering the eu . 
   it 's partially thanks to ukip , like i said then criticise the eu or disagree and you 're ` whining ' . 
  looks like this latest push for an eu army will push the uk out so you 'll be rid of us soon enough , 
  uk has already said they wo n't be joining . 
   however , his ( [ juncker ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/08/jean-claude-juncker-calls-for-eu-army-european-commission-miltary ) ) proposal was immediately rejected by the british government , which said that there was `` no prospect '' of the uk agreeing to the creation of an eu army . 
  are you sure ? 
  though the spending [ is only $ 19b from 10 members ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uqvymfq.png ) , and that 's including $ 9b from poland . 
   and right there everyone here knew what will come next . 
  and right there i knew people would dismiss his opinion because he 's from the uk . 
   what many dont like is that whining attitude of britain , because you do not really know what you want . 
  it 's pretty sad when someone criticises the eu or disagrees with something and they 're labeled as being ` whiny ' . 
  ** gov.uk ** is an excellent source and [ lists the entry requirements ] ( https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice ) for each country . 
  what 's wrong with staying in russia ? 
  mind expanding on that ? 
   why does it seem only americans make this joke ? 
  it 's kind of funny/sad considering the history the us and france has with regards to how the us came about . 
   jesus christ , cameron , just go ahead and do it then , or shut up .
