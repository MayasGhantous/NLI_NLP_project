  correct . 
  nice . 
  thread involving uk and you could n't resist a immigration jab , eh ? 
  bit like flogging a dead horse at this point . 
  lovely to see such high level discussions and debate being promoted in / r/europe . 
  sterling work / u/donvito . 
   speaking to bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme , mr salmond said he did not believe there was `` any wish '' in scotland for the country to leave the eu . 
  - poll from feb. 2013 . 
   over half of scots ( 58 % ) think there should be a referendum on britain 's membership of the european union ( eu ) compared with just over a third who disagree ( 36 % ) . 
   when asked how they would vote in a referendum on whether britain should stay in or leave the eu , just over half of scots said they would vote to stay in ( 53 % ) , compared with a third who said they would vote to leave ( 34 % ) . 
  [ ipsos mori - scots are no euro-enthusiasts ] ( http://www.ipsos-mori.com/newsevents/ca/1323/scots-are-no-euroenthusiasts.aspx ), 
   you left out citing the crypto stuff , but i 'll let that slide  let is slide ? 
  you were moaning about guns and night vision goggles . 
  if i wanted to leave anything out i would n't have linked to the source . 
  :-)  id that was meant as a snide remark , you should have left it out . 
  this is exactly the kind of aggressive posting i did complain about . 
  it was n't a snide remark . 
  aggressive posting ? 
  i merely replied , throwing a little light on your accusations of the uk trading weapons with russia . 
  as someone from the uk , seeing insults about the uk is a daily occurrence here . 
  you get used to it  i guess you 're just not used to it as i 'm seeing a lot of germans complaining about it in the comments . 
   what i 'm saying is that as long as their future membership is in question they should not be allowed to dictate/influence policies , ah classic . 
  typical stuff you see here is `` oh , the uk 's too disengaged from the eu . 
  it 's their island mentality . 
  they want nothing to do with the eu . '', 
  * uk wants eu to block russia from swift * `` who do they think they are dictating/influencing eu policies . '', 
   well , as opposed to britain , we stopped our weapons exports to russia . 
  you make it sound like britain 's fueling russia military . 
  thought i 'd introduce a little fact here as it 's not the first time i 've seen this silly point dredged up today . 
   on face value , few of the licences read like they matter much to the kremlin 's military machine , with its $ 81bn annual budget . 
  during the past 12 months , for example , the uk granted the export of # 480 worth of semiconductor chemicals , and # 6,261 of swimming equipment . 
   even when it comes to more sophisticated technology , the buyers have not been particularly belligerent organisations . 
  night-vision goggles were sold to students for a college project , said number 10 , while small shipments of guns went for sporting purposes . 
   if anything , the state of uk weapons exports to russia shows how little moscow relies on foreign powers for its military prowess . 
  since 2000 , the kremlin has signed only 10 arms contracts of any significance with other nations . 
  [ financial times ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d2ad14c6-1284-11e4-a6d4-00144feabdc0.html )  their insane neighbors rattle their sabers like that all the time i know the uk gets called a lot of stuff here but * insane * is a new one to me . 
  or else they 'll stop importing vodka ? 
   in the british press , everything that comes from the eu becomes controversial . 
  you mean the more right-leaning publications . 
  we would n't want to generalise now and start another eu/uk circlejerk . 
   uk traded them small arms and nv goggles which were all for domestic purposes .

  [ financial times ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d2ad14c6-1284-11e4-a6d4-00144feabdc0.html ) you guys really do n't handle the mud slinging of / r/europe well do you ? 
   harmless compared to all the time throughout the whole history . 
  sure ... 
  i 'd consider the bombings in ww2 fairly aggressive . 
  i do n't get where that 's coming from though . 
  the prime minister of the uk always said he wants the uk to remain in the eu , * albeit a `` reformed '' eu . 
  * the polls of the british public have , pretty much always favoured remaining in the eu . 
   the british do n't want to be in there where are you getting that from ? 
  ** edit : nice , downvoted for asking a legitimate question . 
  err ... sanctions ? 
  the same guy who advised young people with vote apathy not to bother voting . 
  sterling advice . 
  you do know this was posted just hours ago already ? 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ephwj/if_britain_were_a_us_state_it_would_be_the/ the comments there already go over why it 's pretty much nonsense . 
  the us already requested access to microsoft 's servers in dublin - [ microsoft ` must release ' data held on dublin server ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27191500 ), 
  if fox news has a problem with you , you 're probably doing something right . 
  and stop the circlejerk ? 
  never !, 
  because it 's positive news about the uk i 'd imagine . 
  it 's actually quite sad to see how positive news about the uk is shot down in / r/europe . 
  similar forecasts for the uk received the same negative reaction here . 
  / u/edwardthevindictive [ has a bit of grudge against the uk ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/29f554/summers_here_and_france_is_going_on_strike/cikceed ) it 's actually quite depressing ( though not surprising ) he 's being upvoted though he provided no reason why the forecast it wrong . 
  interesting headline you 've settled on and an article from ** 2012 ** no less . 
   he will have to do 240 hours of community service over a two-year period . 
   she [ judge ] told ahmed : `` you posted the message in response to tributes and messages of sympathy . 
  you knew at the time that this was an emotive and sensitive issue . 
   `` with freedom of speech comes responsibility . 
  on march 8 you failed to live up to that responsibility . '', 
  also , op people are no longer really referred to as subjects since the [ british nationality act 1981 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_subject#after_1983 ) . 
  just incase i was n't clear your headline is crap . 
   when it 's default-enabled everywhere it 's just becoming one step from removing the off switch . 
  and that 's how china or iran did it . 
  which is why i 'm that worried . 
  they passed it exactly the same way with the same excuses . 
  no it 's not . 
  china 's golden shield project was never optional in the first place and they were pretty upfront about what it intentions were . 
  hyperbole creeping in . 
  # it 's also disingenuous to compare the two when gsp is entirely run and administered by the government . 
   the question we have to ask ourselves is whether legally requiring service providers to censor websites by default is sensible and proportionate . 
  should be noted they 're not legally required to . 
   i 'm quite aware of that ; but you do n't seem to mind it very much either . 
   ho , so that 's your argument ? 
  `` you are a liar , i do n't have anything to add '' ? 
  enjoy your censorship and have a nice day yep . 
   that 's * one * thing you 're correct on . 
  i do n't mind having the ** optional ** filters and i do n't have them enabled so it 's no problem for me . 
  censorship ? 
  i 'll add that to the ridiculous hyperbole like soviet union and stalin you 've used in this brief chat . 
  yes he 's recently been charged - http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/03/ex-cameron-aide-patrick-rock-faces-trial-child-abuse-images you 're aware you 're linking to the dailymail who were a massive pressure and campaigner ** for ** the filters ? 
   or , really , you tend to ignore the embarassing truth because it 's not any better . 
  the * truth * is something you seem to have a tenuous grasp on with regards to the filter and their implementation . 
  let 's be honest some things you 've said have n't been 100 % fact , have they ? 
   well then why do you keep running the plan of that guy ?
