  as a predator he 's totally there to help and protect your kids right / s why do i keep running the plan ? 
  err i 'm not in charge . 
  :-) we could going keep going around in circles now and it 's clear were n't not going to agree , so i 'll wish you a good day / u/frystes . 
   that is not an argument either . 
  i notice you keep attacking the style and fine point but wo n't argument anything beyond `` that 's not valid '' and `` let 's protect kids '' . 
  not attacking i just do n't find your attempts at drawing analogies of ` rough neighbourhoods ' to the internet , comparisons of the uk to the soviet union or or stalin and your penchant for throwing around labels like ` moral police ' to be very conducive to a constructive chat . 
  so i think i 'll probably leave it there as we both do n't agree . 
   oh and did i mentionned that the architect of your `` child protection system '' is a convicted pedophile ? 
  it 's been well covered on the news channels . 
  he 's recently been [ charged ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/03/ex-cameron-aide-patrick-rock-faces-trial-child-abuse-images ) . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhetorical_question yea , those do n't really work that well when having a discussion on the internet . 
   blackmailing providers to make unwritten rules in soviet style is not any better than writing it down officially . 
  just pointing out you were incorrect to say it 's illegal . 
   the uk gov , and anyone supporting the by-default censorship on the landlines `` to protect kids '' . 
  it just seems like a handly label you have for anyone who disagrees with your point of view . 
   buuut on bt it is . 
  and bt is the biggest around . 
  so you asked a question you already new the answer to ? 
  hmm . 
   yep ; and there is top of nsfw in the street . 
  therefore let 's prevent kids from going out , ever . 
  * facepalm * again your comparisons just really are n't working . 
   no , they basically blackmailed the biggest fai into putting all those filter on default on . 
  which mean that if somebody at bt want to let 's say watch porn he 'll have to call their take support to have the filter suspended . 
  really , that 's not barely disguised morale police ? 
  just correcting * your claim * which it 's been made illegal which was * 100 % incorrect and false * . 
   if somebody at bt want to let 's say watch porn he 'll have to call their take support to have the filter suspended . 
  again incorrect as it 's in a control panel in user settings . 
  you do n't need to contact anyone . 
   really , that 's not barely disguised morale police ? 
  sorry who 's the moral police now ? 
  you first accused me of being it and now it 's some fictional customer support you * do n't * need to contact ? 
   from my understanding you have no choice over the kind of filters , no ? 
  ** from the article ** :  update : talktalk clarified that the file-sharing ( with torrentfreak included ) and social networking filters are not enabled by default on their system . 
   ah , there we go , the moral police ... 
  i 'm not judging . 
  i was * merely * pointing out there 's ** tons ** of nsfw stuff on reddit so it 's not at all surprising it would be a candidate for being blocked if parent had the optional filters . 
   a lot of those being either private or watched very closely and not easily accessible . 
  a lot of it is legal if toeing the border and arresting people for being smartasses is not the way to go , sorry . 
  could n't care less about their motives behind the subreddits . 
   no , i 'm going to point out it 's like in the streets . 
  you have good neighborhoods . 
  you have bad neighborhoods . 
  smart parents watch theyr kids and teach them not to go in the shitty back alley alone while they are gangbangers waiting arounds . 
  but apparently , as a policy some people think it 's better to just ban kids from going out of the house and sequestring them . 
  do n't really see that comparison working . 
   oh yeah the horrible-porn-that-perverted-society-you-neveeeer-watched-as-a-teenager-in-the-back-of-your-parents ; because punishing kids and acting like mormons with a stick up their arses instead of giving them the talk will totally help . 
  therefore let 's ban reddit ? . 
  if you have kids , it 's your job to educate them . 
  not the state 's to make entire sections of the net illegal because you are paranoid about it . 
  and you were * wrongfully * calling me the * moral police * a moment ago ? 
   not the state 's to make entire sections of the net illegal because you are paranoid about it . 
  the state has n't made entire sections of the net illegal . 
  no law has been passed regarding this * optional * filter . 
  not really when part of the article is addressing things being mistakenly blocked . 
  even org 's site ( who 've published that 20 % of all sites number ) says :  in practice , filters block many sites that are not harmful to children . 
  sometimes they are blocked by mistake . 
  sometimes they are blocked deliberately . 
  for example , many blogs and forums are blocked by default . 
   the same can be said for any site with any degree of user-submitted content . 
  tumblr , 4chan , you name it . 
  yup i 'm aware i was replying to his gripe that reddit is blocked . 
   also , you do know / r/jailbait and / r/creepshots were removed ages ago , right ? 
  yup i 'm aware which is why i said :  when there is ** ( or at least has been ) ** subreddits for ... 
  so your problem is that two of the biggest social network sites , facebook and twitter are blocked if the `` social networking '' filter is enabled . 
  i 'm not really surprised reddit is considered unsafe for children when there is ( or at least has been ) subreddits for , pictures of dead kids , jailbait , beatingwomen , creepshot . 
  not to mention the hundreds of nsfw ones of just porn . 
   on the bright side maybe we 'll hear a bit less about how the evil eu wants to cook uk tonight from beyond the english channel / s and just let the rest of europe whine about the uk ? 
  that hardly seems fair :-), 
   as the article suggests many legitimate sites and harmless sites are blocked . 
  and ? 
  no filter has ever been 100 % accurate and this is nothing new . 
  yea but this is reddit and a headline like `` optional filter accidentally blocks wrong sites '' just does n't stir up fear and would ' t be anything new . 
  but a headline like they 've used and mention of the uk in the same breath of iran , or china and it 's a sure hit . 
  current net-worth of $ 29 billion usd . 
  sadly , ca n't imagine he 's losing much sleep over it . 
  i just try and avoid amazon ( and others of similar ilk ) where i can now . 
  opt , for the smaller independent stores .

  oh , [ diddums ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ljwf3l6c1rxmai6o1_500.gif ) . 
  pretty edgy stuff there though . 
   i do n't know , obamas the only president i could actually see playing video games . 
  i know he likes watching tv shows like house of cards and homeland , he also said the wire was one of the best shows ever . 
   he does n't play :  `` i confess , i 'm not very good at video games , but i 've been told that it is a great example of poland 's place in the new global economy and it 's a tribute to the talents and the work ethic of the polish people , as well as the wise stewardship of polish leaders , like prime minister tusk .

  i certainly did n't intend to insult you though i do apologise if there 's any offence taken . 
  and i 'm saying as a briton he does n't speak for me . 
  there 's nothing pedantic about it . 
  what insult was that ? 
  i also find it somewhat interesting you say this lesson you had was * three years ago * . 
  do n't remember the uk/eu being such a hot topic back then . 
  i asked for a link to support your view of merkel . 
  it could have been from a news source or anything . 
  you did n't provide any source . 
  fail to make your point with * actual * evidence to support it and go on the attack . 
  lovely . 
  oh yea you 're absolutely right there . 
  i think reddit 's change of hiding up/down votes helps a little but it 's still largely broken .
