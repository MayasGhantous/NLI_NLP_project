  just have to look at default subreddits and see how just posting a popular opinion and you 're on the karma train express . 
  i was merely pointing out that he does n't speak for everyone of course and the points for remaining/exiting are well known at this point . 
  are you more disappointed because you 're in favour of leaving the eu and someone who shares the same view is being downvoted ? 
  why 'd you hate to write that ? 
  you 've wrote it several times in the last few days . 
  right so you linked to no source . 
  lovely talking to you and have a nice day . 
   that 's not a opinion . 
  a opinion is something you believe , a fact is something which is true and i highly doubt people with more education than you would all have the same opinion . 
  then please link to sources about merkel which support this idea . 
  unless she 's said anything like what you 're claiming then it 's still just an opinion ( or a guess even ) on what she 's thinking/tactics she employing . 
  armchair generals come to mind here . 
  to get back on topic though ... 
  i 've vote my way if a referendum comes about and i guess you can just wait for the results . 
   so obviously merkel would try to make the british think of themselves as important , but had we not been in a economical crisis i 'm more than sure that germany would n't care much about the uk leaving nor would any country for that matter . 
  now you 're just projecting ** your own ** opinion on germany . 
  then you must have a word with merkel who herself has said the uk should n't leave and hopes it does n't . 
  or the german finance minister who [ has today echoed ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/29/uk-germany-idukkbn0f40uu20140629 ) what she said . 
   `` the uk is an essential , indispensable component of the european unity , '' he said according to a transcript of the interview posted online on sunday . 
   `` the eu without the uk is absolutely not acceptable , unimaginable . 
  therefore we have to do everything , so that the interests and the positions of the uk find themselves sufficiently [ represented ] in european politics . '', 
  yea , you 've already made your position quite clear ; and i disagree with you . 
  * again , * i 'm more inclined to agree with politicians from the eu hoping the uk remains , saying it would be a disaster for all to leave rather than a daydream of federalisation . 
  ~ ~ we ~ ~ ** i ** do n't need to be part of europe , ... 
  speak for yourself . 
   are you actually telling me 40 % is a small number ? 
  it 's a minority of course . 
  why be concerned about a minority opinion when the majority would choose to remain . 
  because it suits your agenda ? 
   actually it would a lot easier , reforms would be passed quicker without the uk pulling the `` but muh islands are different '' card . 
  so the eu should dismiss concerns of nations ? 
  that 'll work well towards a unified federalisation then . 
  ** though ** to get back on topic op was being downvoted because some people wish the uk to remain . 
  clearly you 're not one of those though . 
   but if the uk would leave then not only would that satisfy a large portion of the british population but it would also mean that the eu would have a much easier time becoming a federal state . 
  a large portion ? 
  until the last two polls , the majority of british people want to remain in the eu . 
  with ` reforms ' that jumps to overwhelmingly remaining in too with something like 60 % in favour . 
   eu would have a much easier time becoming a federal state . 
  or until another country speaks out against federalisation . 
  i find it hard to believe the uk 's the hurdle between federalization and that no other country will voice a protest against it . 
  i 'm just more inclined to believe the likes of sch\u00e4uble , or joaquin almunia , or any other politician or group who says it 's bad news if the uk leave , rather than the people who 're dreaming of federalisation in the distant future . 
  [ ec vice-president says uk exit ` would be very bad news ' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28083829 ) [ britain leaving the eu would be a ` disaster ' , says angela merkel ally ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/10935169/britain-leaving-the-eu-would-be-a-disaster-says-angela-merkel-ally.html ), 
   i do n't know why you 're getting downvoted . 
  because some people do n't wish to leave ? 
  madness i know . 
   i see that ** british never miss an opportunity to dismiss the french ** ... 
  cute , especially given that * french people tend not to give a fuck about * their channel neighbours . 
  you do know ** the author is french and based in paris ** ? 
  it 's odd you 'd attribute the article to the ` british ' though . 
  as though it reflects the opinion of everyone when * actually * it 's her opinion . 
  and a french one at that too . 
   keep going , it 's definitely the right way . 
  what on earth are you talking about ? 
  the * right way * to what exactly ? 
   `` pernicious anglo-saxons '' , there 's no one who says that here . 
  i 'm not sure about wherever ` here ' is considering your flair is norway but there 's * always tons * of complaining and dismissing of the british on here . 
  so when it 's a british newspaper calling merkel ` black widow ' it 's * germanophobia * and misogyny but when it 's a german publication it 's just misogyny ? 
   anglo-saxon surface . 
  hah right . 
  so what 's it when der spiegel write an article on her and call the black widow ? 
  downvote ? 
  he 's at +6 ? 
  criticising a german politician is ` germanophobia ' now ? 
  [ opinion : the black widow chancellor - der spiegel ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/opinion-the-black-widow-chancellor-a-656571.html ) [ if even merkel attracts ` black widow spider ' sexism , what hope is there for the rest of us ? 
  - independant ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/if-even-merkel-attracts-black-widow-spider-sexism-what-hope-is-there-for-the-rest-of-us-8839577.html ) [ angela merkel , black widow , seeks partner - american prospect ] ( http://prospect.org/article/angela-merkel-black-widow-seeks-partner ) [ german left torn over sharing power with merkel - yahoo ] ( https://news.yahoo.com/german-left-torn-over-sharing-power-merkel-145735448--business.html ) all make references to her as being ` black widow ', 
  wtf ? 
  considering what the original poem is about it 's in bad taste to say the least . 
  the bbc did . 
  he must have missed it as they showed at least one of the debates on the bbc parliament channel - http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0444tj4, 
  can you hear that ? 
  it 's someone who thinks what a newspaper writes reflects what 64 million people think . 
  nor does the article actually attribute any of these worries over drinking to anyone other than ' a source ' but no ... no it 's ` the uk ' scraping the barrel as you put it . 
  not the * telegraph * , but ` the uk ' . 
  -- just a quick search shows that jeroen dijsselbloem , a dutch politician said in january on a dutch talk-show :  however , when asked if smoking and drinking are allowed at eurogroup meetings , dijsselbloem commented that while this has always been forbidden `` the former chairman '' did not stick to the rules . 
   dijsselbloem went on to say that juncker is a `` heavy smoker and drinker . '' [ wort.lu ] ( http://www.wort.lu/en/international/juncker-is-heavy-smoker-and-drinker-says-dijsselbloem-52cd199de4b006114a9b5706 ), 
  nice !, 
  news * that 's a month old * but mentions both muslims and london/england in a negative light . 
  kill two birds with one stone for / r/europe no doubt . 
  i 've visited this sub less frequently lately but glad to see the quality of content is as high as ever . 
  why ? 
  it 's an incredibly popular opinion here so i was just curious , why ? 
  grabs [ popcorn to watch the angry comments pour in ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xw2khgn.gif ) . 
   on the issue of albania , mr cameron 's official spokesman said : `` [ mr cameron ] will block any possible future accession from any country if the types of new and tougher transitional controls that he wants are not in place . 
  not a clue but when there 's nothing in the article to support it being religiously motivated it seems a little wrong for op to try and push that angle . 
  same op mentioned ` sharia zones ' and gets upvoted in the comments so i 'm not surprised he 's playing it like that . 
  and was it relevant ? 
  i see no mention of it being relevant in the story . 
  that 's a lot of presumptions and those ` sharia zones ' were 4 years ago , covered like a street corner and promptly dealt with by the police . 
  it 's amazing how much mileage people have gotten out of that . 
  nothing in the article points to it being religious other than op who 's edited the headline for it . 
  edit : downvote for fact and upvote someone who mentions sharia zones . 
  oh , / r/europe . 
  thank you for noticing this too !, 
  ca n't there be some rule for editing titles in / r/europe ? 
  or removing the daily mail ? 
  why are you trying to put a religious motivated spin on this ? 
   clearly romanians and other eastern europeans are britain 's biggest concern . 
  very original . 
  engage circlejerk !,
