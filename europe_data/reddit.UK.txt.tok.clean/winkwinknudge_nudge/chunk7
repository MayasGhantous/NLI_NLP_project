  also , was n't the original headline good enough for you to stir up a bit of hate in / r/europe ? 
  i noticed you edited it to `` gang of ** muslim ** men '' the original makes no mention of religion in the headline . 
   thats why the referendums need to happen as fast as possible , if the eu one happens at all , 
  i guess i come at it from a different angle and do n't have a problem with nations working together , sharing resources , hardware , knowledge and you 'd rather people go it alone . 
  i see it as a good thing that nations help to cover weaknesses in others where as you seem to see it as a bit shameful . 
  like how american 's on here constantly bring up libya or now mali it seems as a source ridicule . 
  op 's point was `` how capable the eu is '' and by most accounts it 's a successful & well-run operation . 
  you seem intent on whittling down the participants to solely france & the us . 
  again you seem to be ignoring other eu nations involved . 
  it 's odd that . 
   the one where the us is providing logistics ? 
  along with a few eu nations :-) let 's not ignore that , / u/azog . 
  a [ yougov ] ( http://today.yougov.com/news/2011/08/15/bloombergyougov-poll-reports-no-appetite-any-more-/ ) poll from 2011 . 
  there 's a [ list of results on the wikipedia page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_and_the_euro#polls ) . 
  do you post similar comments on all the stories * you * do n't care about ? 
  that must be exhausting !, 
   tell me more anti-junker propaganda , mr. bri t. ishdude . 
  something which legitimately criticized his actions is `` anti-junker propaganda '' now ? 
   there is no comment i can see that questions an absence of discussion in that thread . 
  [ see ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28myzo/cooperation_between_germanys_foreign_intelligence/cicpvxu ) :  threads about gypsies , muslims , islam , terrorists , immigrants and other imaginary fairytale threats on / r/europe [ 1 ] : 5000000 comments  threads about actual threats , nsa and the bnd and gchq : 10 comments, 
   and again , creeping self-victimization . 
  i 'd disagree . 
  look at how much discussion it has on / r/europe alone when it 's gchq vs. bnd . 
  the [ bnd thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28myzo/cooperation_between_germanys_foreign_intelligence/ ) the other day had like 15 comments , most of those either off-topic or questioning the absence of discussion on it . 
   also , the eu had nothing to do with it , this lays solely on the national governments . 
  you 're right i meant eu states . 
   i really dislike the extent of the self-victimization , and i will not approach matters with rose tinted glasses because of such reactions . 
  just saying . 
  you said why should anyone care and you seem quite interested in it . 
  certainly seem to care enough to devote quite a bit of your time to it . 
   why the `` tu quoque '' ? 
  the proper reaction to the media backlash to these allegations is to get on the bandwagon and call for reform , not defend them by calling everyone guilty . 
  you made it seem as though the usa were forcing it on the eu when it 's clearly not the case and they 're very complicit in data sharing . 
  it 'd be great for reform but wo n't happen until people stop passing the blame solely to gchq and the nsa while turning a blind eye to other eu parties doing it . 
  well * you * seem to care . 
  most of your comments are filled with disparaging remarks towards the uk and wanting it to leave the eu . 
   fending off russian belligerence and usa intelligence , usa intelligence ? 
  [ most the eu 's complicit in doing it ] ( http://euobserver.com/justice/124679 ) . 
   the worst thing i saw was the girl operating the eiffel tower 's lift using her phone and looking bored , but then again her job is n't exactly stimulating so i ca n't say i blame her . 
  the lift operator 's day is filled with up 's and down 's . 
  it also depends on what poll you 're using . 
  yougov for instance published a poll just the other day which had 44 % voting to remain and 36 % to leave . 
  the largest lead for sometime . 
  [ record lead for staying in europe - yougov ] ( http://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/06/17/eu-referendum-record-lead/ )  the british public are increasingly positive about staying in the union -- according to research into how people would vote in an in/out eu membership referendum . 
  yougov 's latest poll for the sun finds an eight point lead for those who want britain to remain in the european union , the largest lead recorded since yougov first asked the question in september 2010 . 
  44 % would now vote to stay in the union , while 36 % would vote to leave . 
  [ graph img ] ( http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2014-06-17/eurefjun16-2.png ) though i know that goes against what people here like to believe :-), 
  or just not buy into everything to read on the internet . 
  after all the stuff of a few newscasters resigning because of the influence of the russian gov on rt it baffles me why anyone still uses it at all . 
  well it helps to know a little bit about what you 're commenting on rather than making completely false assumptions . 
  though the [ notes and guidance ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-science-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-science-programmes-of-study#year-6-programme-of-study ) does include darwin :  pupils might find out about the work of palaeontologists such as mary anning and about how charles darwin and alfred wallace developed their ideas on evolution . 
  also worth a mention the government are actually including the teaching of evolution to primary schools ( ages 4 -11 ) from next year . 
  with regards to the new rules for academies and free schools , they have produced a definition of what they consider to be ` creationism ' in the new clauses they 've introduced . 
   23e ) the parties acknowledge that clauses 2.43 and 2.44 of the funding agreement [ which preclude the teaching of pseudoscience and require the teaching of evolution ] apply to all academies . 
  they explicitly require that pupils are taught about the theory of evolution , and prevent academy trusts from teaching ` creationism ' as scientific fact . 
  --  23f ) ` creationism ' , for the purposes of clauses 2.43 and 2.44 of the funding agreement and clause 23e above , is any doctrine or theory which holds that natural biological processes can not account for the history , diversity , and complexity of life on earth and therefore rejects the scientific theory of evolution . 
  the parties acknowledge that creationism , in this sense , is rejected by most mainstream churches and religious traditions , including the major providers of state funded schools such as the [ anglican ] [ catholic ] churches , as well as the scientific community . 
  it does not accord with the scientific consensus or the very large body of established scientific evidence ; nor does it accurately and consistently employ the scientific method , and as such it should not be presented to pupils at the academy as a scientific theory . 
  --  23g ) the parties recognise that the teaching of creationism is not part of prevailing practice in the english education system , but acknowledge that it is however important that all schools are clear about what is expected in terms of the curriculum which they need to provide . 
  the parties further recognise that the requirement on every academy and free school to provide a broad and balanced curriculum , in any case prevents the teaching of creationism as evidence based theory in any academy or free school . 
  --  23h ) the secretary of state acknowledges that clauses 2.43 and 2.44 of the funding agreement , and clauses 23e and 23g above do not prevent discussion of beliefs about the origins of the earth and living things , such as creationism , in religious education , as long as it is not presented as a valid alternative to established scientific theory . 
  i 'm out of my depth here and do n't know if it contradicts or supports theistic evolution . 
   so this should actually refer to state schools . 
  specifically free schools and academies . 
  your run-of-the-mill-state-school has had to teach evolution as part of the national curriculum . 
  free schools and academies do n't have to follow the national curriculum as closely which has resulted in the gov. 
  banning teaching creationism as science in them . 
   ... so it was in the state curriculum until now ? 
  that is fucking scary no it was n't . 
  showing your own ignorance a little there / u/kicker7955, 
  there 's a little bit being lost in translation as public schools in the uk ** are ** what most would know as private schools . 
  ( incidentally , private schools do not have to follow the national curriculum ) in ** state schools ** creationism taught as science over evolution is n't allowed . 
  state schools ** have ** to follow the [ national curriculum ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-science-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-science-programmes-of-study ) which is set by the gov and it includes the teaching of evolution , specifically :  - recognise that living things have changed over time and that fossils provide information about living things that inhabited the earth millions of years ago - recognise that living things produce offspring of the same kind , but normally offspring vary and are not identical to their parents - identify how animals and plants are adapted to suit their environment in different ways and that adaptation may lead to evolution in academies and free schools ( account 12 % of uk schools ) it may have been [ which is the type of school ] ( https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school ) this new ruling applies to . 
  the gov. 
  in 2012 made a ruling that * all future * future schools ( excluding academies ) had to teach evolution and forbid them from teaching pseudoscience as science . 
  april the gov updated this to include all future academies . 
  [ the british humanist association offers a better overview , history and summation ] ( https://humanism.org.uk/2014/06/18/victory-government-bans-existing-future-academies-free-schools-teaching-creationism-science/ ) :  in other words , in the government 's view , if an academy or free school teaches creationism as scientifically valid then it is breaking the requirement to provide a broad and balanced curriculum . 
  as every academy and free school has this requirement in its funding agreement , the implication of this interpretation is that no academy and free school , existing or future , can teach pseudoscience . 
  heh pretty much . 
  [ this may be ] ( https://humanism.org.uk/2014/06/18/victory-government-bans-existing-future-academies-free-schools-teaching-creationism-science/ ) a better article on it . 
  also , to give it a [ little perspective academies account for ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-than-2600-schools-now-open-as-academies-with-a-further-500-set-to-join-them-soon ) just 12 % ( 2,600 ) of schools in the uk . 
  well just to confuse thing a little more it 's specifically talking about academies which are run a little more independently from * state schools * but still receive some government funding . 
   academies do n't have to follow the national curriculum and can set their own term times . 
  they still have to follow the same rules on admissions , special educational needs and exclusions as other state schools . 
  [ gov.uk source ] ( https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/academies ), 
  public schools are the ones like eton ( cameron , clegg ) which cost # 30,000 a year to attend . 
  state schools are the ones which are free , tax funded and the one a majority of kids will go to . 
  within the uk they 're referred to as that ( public or state ) which is why it could be a bit of a misnomer in the article to refer to uk schools as just `` public schools '' which is n't savvy to the distinction between the two . 
   well , religion was/is actually an occurring thing in uk public schools . 
  i saw a documentary once a few years back , and attending the chapel was something that you were pretty much obliged to do . 
  it 's worth noting the difference between * [ public schools ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_school_\\ ( united_kingdom \\ ) ) * & * [ state schools ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state-funded_schools_\\ ( england \\ ) ) * in the uk . 
  public schools are the expensive and exclusive ones . 
  i went to a state school and the closest we came to anything religious was re which taught aspects of many different religions . 
  there was certainly no chapel though in any of the 3 state schools i went so i 'd be interested to see that documentary . 
  edit : also worth noting the new ruling affects academies which account for 12 % of uk schools . 
  i know i 'd rather live in a `` petty '' , `` declining empire '' ( did n't that happen in the 60 's ? ), 
  over china . 
   is that * there are people in the us who are trying to fight this * , and he did n't see the same thing happening in the uk . 
  i can really only think of snowden then and he was in a privileged position of working at the nsa and had to abscond . 
  there 's been legal action taken in the uk along with other groups against it .
