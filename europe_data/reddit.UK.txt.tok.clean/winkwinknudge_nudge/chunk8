  not really expecting / u/magadget to know that though with his derisive tone . 
  you mean guy who had to run from the us to russia , manning who 's now in prison , or assange who 's afraid of being extradited to the us ? 
   while in the usa there is still some civil decency left , that 's quite an odd way of looking at it . 
   so voters in uk are all for leaving eu , but only to the point when it starts being a real possibility ? 
  just [ ignore the fact that the uk has been favouring remaining in the eu for sometime ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_referendum_on_united_kingdom_membership_of_the_european_union#opinion_polling ) to make a snide comment . 
  nice . 
  what in the channel 4 piece was a lie then ? 
   it 's owned by an american company ? 
  is it ? 
   it ( thomson reuters ) was created by the thomson corporation 's purchase of british-based reuters group on 17 april 2008 , [ 5 ] and today is majority owned by the woodbridge company , a holding company for the thomson family of canada . 
   has been monitoring thousands of political activists in order , it says , to identify the hardcore minority who have broken , or are about to break , the law during protests . 
  [ and the same jenny jones ] ( http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100160423/dont-vote-green-until-they-drop-the-anti-science-zealotry/ ) is a green party member who attended the `` take the flour back '' campaign whose aim was to destroy gm wheat crops grown as part of a scientific trial/experiment . 
  i remember rothamsted research even [ made a youtube video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9scgtf5e3i ) trying to talk them down from attacking their facility and educate them on it a little . 
  it depends which publications you 're reading just like any other country . 
  so what in the channel 4 news report was '' lies and exaggeration in a venomous way '' ? 
  i get it though . 
  press reports on something which does n't show a country in its best light and it 's `` boo crappy british press '' . 
  i mean der spiegel [ reported ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-hamburg-romanian-family-makes-begging-a-dubious-business-a-960866.html ) on romanian 's panhandling in germany . . boo crappy german press against romania , eh ? 
  huh ? 
  it 's a follow-up piece to one that channel 4 news did in may . 
  obsessed ? 
  sure blame the british press . 
  it 's a common thing in this subreddit . 
  you make it seem as though there 's a conspiracy . 
  it 's really quite funny . 
  still waiting for him to backup his petty threats of publishing all he has on england . 
  guess he 's more interested gathering publicity and flogging his new book though . 
  you mean channel 4 news have reported on it twice . 
  - [ beneath the streets of romania 's capital , a living hell - 13th june ] ( http://www.channel4.com/news/romania-tunnels-bucharest-orphans-photo ) - [ is death the only escape from life in romania 's tunnels ? 
  - 20th may ] ( http://www.channel4.com/news/bucharest-tunnels-funeral-romania-bruce-lee-catalina-aids ) hardly ` the british press ' though i know people here like to knock it . 
  what about reuters makes it a us source ? 
   france will be comparatively more happy , since they will be the foremost military power of the eu and the only nuclear one . 
  why would that please the french ? 
  would n't that place an even bigger burden of eu security/defense on them even more so ? 
   as for all the other countries , a lot of things that were n't possible due to british vetoes suddenly will become possible . 
   a lot of grievances can be addressed within the eu when there 's no one to step on the brakes . 
  people would quickly find a new country to vilify within the eu . 
  it 's a common theme of being incredibly petty here if the uk leaves . 
   treating protest as something to be crushed and thus tilting the balance of power further away from citizens and toward the state . 
  is that what they were doing while burning down buildings , stealing clothes and anything else they could get their hands on in 2011 ? 
  [ robbing and vandalizing ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14508554 ) a 90 year old 's barber shop ? 
  these were n't people who had some ideological idea they wanted to share but to just try and grab anything that was n't nailed down . 
  [ it 's only been ** 3 days ** since the last one of these ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27myjk/what_are_your_views_on_scottish_independence/ ) . 
  i ca n't imagine it 's changed much since then . 
   even the bbc is broadcasting plain lies about the eu now . 
  such as ? 
  forgive my skepticism but / r/europe has been throwing flak at the british press for sometime now . 
  though many items in the subreddit are largely sourced from the same horrible british press they have a problem with . 
  is n't that widespread though ? 
  i 've always read about americans wondering if they should say they 're canadian no matter where they 're travelling just for a warmer reception .

  [ bbc radio 4 ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/5jrmmqhnnxvtzfv8mcmcbdn/d-day-news-bulletins ), 
   it 's quite possible it 's true but i would n't believe this just yet , the british press has gone utterly ridiculous over juncker these last few days well it 's from der spiegel , the same source which reported anonymous sources saying cameron was going to leave the eu early but people did n't seem to question its validity here and ran with it . 
  this is n't the british press  original source - http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/eu-spitzenstreit-rompuy-lager-erwartet-rueckzieher-junckers-a-973879.html,

  maybe take a page out of [ merkel 's ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20140604/angela-merkel-blasts-unacceptable-attacks-on-uk-over-juncker ) book if you 're a fan of the eu :  `` i do n't share these reservations but i must say just as clearly that i consider it grossly irresponsible , and actually unacceptable , how nonchalantly some say that it does n't matter whether britain agrees or not , or even whether britain remains an eu member or not , '' she said . 
  nope born with this affliction sadly :p, 
  i have ginger hair and what of it ?!, 
  also , your link does n't work . 
  na , i think he just started looking both ways . 
   europe : drive on the right like anyone else ? 
  britain : no we really rather would n't . 
  what advantage would there be for the eu or the uk in that ? 
  it would cost a fortune . 
  it 's an odd one that people seem to bring up a fair bit . 
  there [ was already one of these sorts of threads ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/23zbvd/how_are_the_british_viewed_in_europe/ ) with 440 + comments . 
  it was generally negative . 
  * tl ; dr * - ugly - drunkards for tourists - bad tourists - bad food - tan badly/red ( ? ), 
   gideon rachman , columnist for the financial times , wrote that the idea that the native of luxembourg could become commission president `` evokes a strange , irrational rage in the british . '', 
  think he might be overestimating how much the british public care just a * little * bit . 
  it was reported [ by dw.de ] ( http://www.dw.de/us-faces-post-election-leadership-vacuum-in-eu/a-17679525 ) but i 've not seen much else on it . 
   ... that juncker , a committed european federalist , would undermine already waning public support for eu membership in the euro-skeptic uk . 
  finland , france , hungary , the netherlands and sweden have also reportedly expressed reservations about juncker . 
  and [ thelocal.de ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20140602/germany-uk-belongs-in-eu ) said :  besides cameron , leaders in sweden , hungary and , according to several european sources , the netherlands and finland are also hostile to juncker . 
  could n't get the uk 's flag the right way around in their image though ... 
  well france is america 's oldest ally , 
   you can discard that option , it 's not going to happen . 
  what gave you that idea ? 
  that his next sentence you cut off was exactly that ? 
  ** '' but we all know that 's not going to happen , '' **,

   seriously , the uk has lost every bit of diplomatic goodwill it ever had in brussels and strasbourg . 
  was there such a thing ? 
  you 're not going to find much different in / r/europe . 
  it seems especially more so lately . 
  pretty sad that 's the ` best ' comment in this thread too along with many in a similar vein . 
  essentially `` i want the uk to leave so companies locate elsewhere and people are left jobless '' what a lovely , caring community the eu and this subreddit is , eh ? 
  pff . 
  if they 're sufficiently encrypted , which they should already be considering the nature of the data ; what 's the problem ? 
  last i heard gchq nor the nsa or any other spy agency ca n't break every single encryption method that 's out there so it 's not useless to encrypt . 
  they 're looking for friendly countries to host the data and last time i checked the uk is one of them . 
  or is this just going to devolve into a circlejerk about gchq and the uk ? 
   other cultures are ok , but british is best .
