  as i said , similar to french exceptionalism . 
  that 's an interesting take on it as there 's a poll which shows germany ( 47 % ) think their culture is superior to others with britain and france being the least likely to think this . 
  http://i.imgur.com/ovs6lfv.png  about half of ** americans ( 49 % ) ** and ** germans ( 47 % ) ** agree with the statement , * `` our people are not perfect , but our culture is superior to others ; '' * ** 44 % in spain ** share this view . 
  in ** \\ britain and france , only about a third or fewer ( 32 % and 27 % , respectively ) \\* * think their culture is better than others . 
  [ pew research centre ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/11/17/the-american-western-european-values-gap/ ), 
  pretty consistently always been mid-30 % . 
  quite interesting to see other country 's participation has fallen drastically though - http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/000cdcd9d4/turnout - ( 1979-2009 ) . html, 
  why were you on the daily mail to begin with and what did you expect ? 
   what policies are far right ? 
  they do n't have many polices to begin with . 
  well , people have been saying that sort of drivel for years ( especially here ) . 
  at this point it 's just like whitenoise , 
   i think dailydot is just preying on the stereotype of the uk being naysayers . 
  pretty much . 
  the buzzfeed had a similar story the other day that someone submitted here . 
  most the dailydot 's headlines are just link-bait with little substance behind them . 
  yup , the vltava river . 
   nonsense , they just do n't publish it when it comes to the other parties . 
   the media is extremely cozy with those in power and always has been . 
  surely farage could bring it up in any of the columns he writes for the papers ? 
  they have so many lovely candidates , though . 
  see ukip 's janice atkinson for example [ sticking her finger up at protesters ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lraatqx.jpg ) . 
   each party does have their idiots and making it sound like it is some party line what some one persons says is retarded . 
  you do n't have to agree with ukip but you can not say he 's not got a point here . 
  like the interviewer said it 's coming largely from ukip members . 
  it does n't seem like a day goes by without a ukip candidate making ridiculous comments and ultimately they represent ukip . 
  yes , the global sustainability institute well known for publishing propaganda for the bbc to push by request of the government , because we know how close the tories are with the bbc . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; nevermind the fact it 's been reported by most news vendors . 
  * [ europe suffering from a lack of energy : report - cnbc ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/id/101679941 ) * [ domestic gas reserves could dry up in three years , report warns - guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/domestic-gas-reserves-dry-up-report ) * [ uk to ` run out of fossil fuels ' in five years - independent ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/uk-to-run-out-of-fossil-fuels-in-five-years-9385415.html ) * [ france has ` less than one year ' of fossil fuels left - itv news ] ( http://www.itv.com/news/update/2014-05-16/france-has-less-than-one-year-of-fossil-fuels-left/ ), 
  so original . 
  and how has that materialised exactly ? 
  http://golondon.about.com/od/londonpictures/ig/less-seen-sights/george-washington-statue.htm is the only one i know/found . 
   i think a major leader flagrantly lying seems to not be news anymore very strange , however . 
  politicians lying as never been major news . 
  i frankly , do n't trust ukip with editing a video when they can easily make it say anything which aligns with their view . 
  the quality of submissions in the subreddit really is dropping . 
  you might aswell include the full quote :  alun cairns : to ask the secretary of state for culture , media and sport ( 1 ) what assessment he has made of the implications for his department 's policies on voluntary restrictions by network providers of adult content of recent proposals from the european parliament on a european single market for electronic communications ; [ 198046 ]  * ( 2 ) what assessment he has made of eu proposals to remove the right for network operators to block 18-plus content . 
  [ 197702 ] *  mr vaizey : we are aware that there some concerns that the european parliament 's amendments to the draft connected continent regulation may restrict isps ability to block illegal content or to filter adult content at the request of customers . 
  ** the uk government supports the aims of the connect continent package ** , but let me clear that we will not agree to any proposals that restrict the ability of parents to protect their children from inappropriate content on line . 
  we are confident that this was not the intention of the european parliament and we are working with eu member states , the european commission and the european parliament to deliver a final package that promotes an open , safe and secure internet . 
  * edit : * ** emphasis mine and it 's a crucial line which seems to be absent from buzzfeed . 
  though they seem to have omitted the beginning of the quote to give it a tilt that the uk 's against it entirely . 
  ** [ source ] ( http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140512/text/140512w0001.htm ) buzzfeed is bad . 
   is n't there a huge italian american subculture that directly spawned as a result of this ? 
  i 'm not sure if the stereotypes hold true , but are n't most people in long island and new jersey the children and grandchildren of italians who had to leave for a better life ? 
  if the sopranos taught me anything it 's that . 
  * i kid . 
   most read news paper in uk that would be [ the sun ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/table/2014/mar/14/abcs-national-newspapers ) . 
  hey you changed to the title to make it competitive . 
  i 've seen crazier claims from americans on here , 
  you must be looking for murica subreddit ? 
  i ca n't imagine many people here care . 
  also :  the amount of wine drunk per head is still higher in france than in the us . 
   according to figures from 2011 , the average french person drinks just over a bottle a week , six times more than the average us consumer . 
  it is an odd change from the bbc 's title of * `` us overtakes france as world 's biggest wine market '' *, 
  or even easier is to just use the private browsing mode in most browsers i suppose . 
  ctrl-shift-n in chrome for incognito mode . 
  it 's not . 
  i guess you just get most of your news from reddit ? 
  i 'm aware of the number for cctv . 
  i * think * you 've posted it before ? 
  like i said it 's generally in cities and something like 90 % are privately owned . 
  isp filtering is pretty much what i said that it 's for new customers . 
  i 've not * heard * of any current customers having it enabled . 
  i know big four isps ( talktalk , bt , virgin , sky ) have n't enabled filtering by default for any current customers . 
  cctv everywhere ? 
  it 's not . 
  it 's generally limited to cities . 
  internet filters that you need to ask to not get ? 
  there are n't any . 
  i 've never had any filters enabled and you 're asked when you create an account with a new isp . 
  right you are !, 
  i always forget to differentiate the two . 
  as you say though they 're * evading tax * so it 's not really owed in that sense because it 's not really illegal . 
  just a crappy thing to do . 
  you 're right though ; cameron would never dare rock that boat but criticize the likes of jimmy carr as ` immoral ' for evading it and not even commenting on the fact that take that members owe # 20m as their tax regime was deemed to be for the sole purpose of evading tax . 
  reminds me of when starbucks ** offered ** to pay # 20m in tax after they were boycotted . 
  the same goes for amazon , google and the other usual suspects .

  npr - [ europeans are getting fatter , just like americans ] ( http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/05/09/311116522/europeans-are-getting-fatter-just-like-americans ), 
   in romania , the poorest country in europe , only 10 percent of women are likely to be classified as obese by 2030 , as opposed to ireland where 47 percent of women will meet the criteria . 
  * but the variations , warns webber , are likely caused by a scarcity of data from romania * . 
   overall , she believes the figures are likely to be underestimated if anything , as the rising obesity levels in children have not been factored in . 
  i 'm a little more surprised at ireland overtaking the uk though . 
   he insists he has never had animosity towards britain . 
  `` but the more i 've learned , the more troubling it has become . '', 
  err ... yeah . .  `` grown adults who have been elected or appointed to nothing run around with a straight face insisting that they be called `` lord '' and `` baroness '' and other grandiose hereditary titles of the landed gentry . 
  they bow and curtsey to a `` queen '' , who lives in a `` palace '' , and they call her sons `` prince '' . 
  they embrace a wide range of conceits and rituals of a long-ago collapsed empire . '', 
  - feb 2014 ( * surely bonus points for bringing up the empire too ? 
  that 's one well which never runs dry !, 
  * ) or  mr greenwald said : `` i will be far more aggressive in my reporting from now . 
  i am going to publish many more documents . 
   `` i am going to publish things on england too . 
  i have many documents on england 's spy system . 
  i think they will be sorry for what they did . '', 
  - aug 2013 yeah ... no animosity there then . 
  guess he ca n't come to the uk and push his new book or collect fees for speaking . 
   oh come on , surely you 're not that dumb .
