  it 's already recovering . 
  the uk has this `` special relationship '' with america so people are interested in what this idiot has to say . 
  less well off people blaming immigration and the eu for their own failures in life . 
  doubtful now . 
  i was hoping they would overthrow it and then cameron resigns afterwards but he has already resigned so there 's no chance because there 's no one one to blame for it . 
  denmark , when is your referendum ? 
  it 's a lot of uncertainty because no one really knows what will happen now . 
  he was a secret believer in brexit . 
  most places reporting remain ca n't win and declare leave the result . 
  i woke up at 4am and checked but now i ca n't get back to sleep . 
  i was so sure it was going to be an easy win for remain . 
  it 's not part of the uk . 
  i think people are basing it on the final yougov poll . 
  in other things we vote for there 's often exit polls , which are more accurate predictors . 
  i ca n't remember a time i have voted with a pen . 
  it 's always been a pencil . 
  has anyone actually seen the polling cards ? 
  if anyone wanted to forge votes they could simply just photocopy them and put loads in the box . 
  this whole pencil issue is complete nonsense . 
  congratulations ireland . 
   now all the british isles are through to the last 16 . 
  scotland ? 
  that would n't bother me much because it would just be the odd coin . 
  i do n't particularly hate the royal family but i just do n't like the idea of a monarchy in this modern world . 
  well , it is . 
  he has no control of how many citizens from other eu states come here . 
  he will just have to make it somehow less appealing to eastern europeans who want to work here . 
  the uk has the advantage and disadvantage of speaking english . 
  it would he harder for immigrants to move to many other countries in the eu simple because of language . 
  everyone seems to learn english . 
  i say it 's about time parisians get to the streets and protest !, 
  i hope we do join the euro , and get rid of that family from my wallet for good !, 
  it looks looks she did n't go down on her man , though . 
  everyone in europe planning a holiday , make sure your travel insurance covers disruption from volcanoes . 
  so many people were massively out of pocket when they got stuck abroad when eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull erupted . 
  i 'm going to iceland in october so i hope it erupts way before then !, 
  low birth rate , higher death rate and i believe they 're still recovering from the soviet union ? 
  i thought this , too . 
  lithuanians - do they sound like they know the language ? 
  eastern europe , please have more babies . 
   ** errect ** a gigantic ** phallos ** tee hee !, 
  there was an earthquake with an epicentre in lincolnshire . 
  the country went mad , banks went mad , wages went down . 
  is n't shoreditch full of middle class white hipster kids who go to cat cafes and buy vinyl ? 
  god , it 's all so fickle . 
  could they not wait ? 
  the uk used to speak french . 
  imagine that , french could have been the global language instead of english . 
  i live in the north east of england and for me romance languages have too many differences in pronunciation , such as french being nasal and spanish being slightly `` lispy '' . 
  i sound like i am taking the piss when i try to speak them . 
  i find germanic ones much easier to read and speak , and it might be because of my accent . 
  i live in a part of the country which has heavily influenced by scandinavian invaders ; we even have a lot of towns ending in '' - by '' , which i believe it danish for town . 
  but , yeah , english is almost like a hybrid germanic and romance language . 
  most germanic and romance languages are easiest to learn for native english speakers because they have a lot of similarities , such as being written in the latin script , not-so-complicated sentence structures etc. 
  i believe german is n't in the same class as those mentioned mainly because of it 's structure . 
  it probably depends on where you are from , too , because your accent can often determine how difficult a language is . 
  in the north east of england i swear some of the slang terms are scandinavian , such as `` gan yam '' for `` going home '' ( danish is `` g\u00e5 hjem '' ? 
  ) , `` no '' is `` nee '' ( nej ), 
  strangely dutch is apparently the easiest language for a native english speaker to learn . 
  i ca n't say for certain without listening properly , but most of the languages from eastern europe sound similar . 
  i guess it they kind of fade out gradually , where the countries closest to russia sound more russian and then they gradually become more germanic as we come into central and western europe ( of course , there 's loads of exceptions ), 
  they do n't sound silly but i can tell polish apart from the others , but it 's probably because there 's quite a lot of polish people in my town so i hear it often . 
  to my untrained ears , a lot of the central and eastern european languages sound like russian spoken by a german . 
  an awful lot of people 's opinions are based on tabloid drama already . 
  i have sky so i 'll check it out , cheers . 
  vis a vis is great . 
  it 's nothing like orange is the new black , so those reviews are just very lazy . 
  it 's a lot better . 
  it was at a radiohead album listening party ... it pretty much says that in the first line of the story . 
  i think the figure is more like 50,000 , not 5,000 . 
  indeed it has but for some reason people ca n't understand that . 
  the leave campaign is playing on it , too . 
  i received a leaflet which highlighted the countries set to join the eu and iraq and syria were on there !, 
  it was n't saying they were joining but it highlighted them and if you never read it properly dot definitely looks like they are going to join !, 
  in britain we use the term asian to mean western and southern asia , but it is a very loose term , i agree . 
  let 's be honest , ~ 2,000 a year is nothing . 
  however , it should n't be a human right . 
  everyone knows circumcision is not natural . 
  it 's only done for religious reasons in most of the world . 
  the only time it should be practised is if there 's a medical need for it , which is relatively rare . 
  i do n't know what is going on with yorkshire and lancashire and these asian paedophile gangs but it 's sickening . 
  the referendum can be overturned but it would put an awful lot of distrust in the government so i do n't know if they 'd risk it . 
  eu reforms is a better deal . 
  should n't microsoft hate the eu after they pretty much killed internet explorer and cost them over half a $ billion ? 
  and also the same with windows media player . 
  the problem is a lot of brits think that staying in the eu means we 'll be saying with '' \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 '' they are , of course , dickheads . 
  yeah , whatever , norway clearly want nentry !, 
  ok , joke ... people use norway as an example of a european country that is doing alright outside of the eu , but the uk is nothing like norway . 
  norway has a population smaller than london , it 's cost if living is high , it has an abundance of natural resources and it operates differently . 
  does n't norway pay more per capita to be in the single market than the uk does ? 
  walter presents is channel 4 's foreign language on demand service and most of the content is from europe . 
  i watched locked up ( vis a vis from spain ) recently and it was really good . 
  they also brought deutschland 83 to the uk ( which i believe was broadcast in the usa , too ) . 
  there 's stuff from denmark , czech republic , france , sweden etc on there . 
  it 's great that the uk are finally taking note of non-english content . 
  if you 're ever in the uk just flick the channel when an advert comes on and you 'll almost always come to another advert . 
  it 's really annoying . 
  it 's worse on the music channels . 
  you flick over because there 's adverts rather than music on and there is an advert , often the same one ( !, 
  ) , on the other channels as well .
