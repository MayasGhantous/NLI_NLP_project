  when i was in berlin i found it difficult to get online other than buying stupidly expensive mobile data . 
  i 'm glad it 's about to change , though . 
  nope , but with pretty much anything positive the nordic countries always end up somewhere near the top . 
  they must be doing something right !, 
  i do n't fully understand what this is but the nordic countries top another index !, 
  ( except iceland ? ), 
  where 's the warsaw pact when you need it ? 
  indeed . 
  400 years is nothing by european standards . 
  it 's odd seeing the regions surrounding the capital showing as the biggest risk in the country . 
  as a brit i am used to everything being `` london-centric '' and the prosperity spreading out from london , like in [ this map ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2011/11/24/1322127188757/heat-map-wages-002.jpg ) , which is based on average wage in the area . 
  the around surrounding london benefit from higher earners probably working in london , hence the areas are more prosperous . 
  there seems to be a lot of divides in european countries ( and i assume much of the world ? 
  ) , like the north/south divide in the uk and italy ( although swapped around ) and the east/west one with germany . 
  i have quite literally just came back from aldi and bought a pack !, 
  they 're from spain so they 'll be cheaper to get here than the ones from south america . 
  yes !, 
  sorry , i copied the map from the gun crime article on wikipedia and assumed it was just for death from shooting . 
  if they succeed with this then people will ask `` what is classified as hate speech '' and another can of worms will be opened . 
  i do n't see why they would n't , other than if we `` break up '' they might spit their dummies out . 
  i went on an exchange to uppsala in sweden and it was one of the highlights of my education . 
  i 'm voting to stay in anyway . 
  that makes sense . 
  it 's actually quite similar in the uk . 
  our welfare system makes it easier for people not to work if they only have the option of taking low paid jobs , but the government are making a push to get people into work ( and it 's often quite horrible ! ), 
  we have a thing called `` working tax credits '' which is designed to top up the income of low earners so they can stay in work , and we do n't pay tax until we earn # 11,000 ( $ 14,500 ) , but the uk government would never just hand out money to encourage people to work . 
  they actually want to do the opposite and stop giving out money to low earners . 
  they proposed cutting it for 3 million people and there was uproar . 
  they go down a little in summer but not massively . 
  supermarkets will probably keep the prices artificially inflated in summer so the winter ones do n't look too bad . 
  blueberries are the same . 
  i buy a punnet for about # 2 over winter and in summer they go down to about 80p !, 
  i guess it would depend on what criteria has been used in this map . 
  it does n't mention if the guns are personally owned , owned professionally ( police , military etc ) , or a mixture of both . 
  even so , switzerland has the most guns per capita in europe , yet one of the lowest gum homicide rates . 
  it 's probably more to do with the psyche of a nation but i 'm no psychologist . 
  very true . 
  strawberries in the main supermarkets taste , well , they 're tasteless . 
  i am sure when i was a kid strawberries tasted delicious no matter where they were from . 
  it would work in countries like switzerland who are rich and have relatively small populations . 
  however , try implementing this in places like france , germany or the uk who are rich but have tens of millions of people living there . 
  the uk government already `` top up '' people 's incomes if they 're under a certain level and , unfortunately , it 's proving unsustainable ( hence loads of welfare cuts ) . 
  also , depending on how it was implemented it could simply stop people being ambitious and wanting to do better . 
  why try harder when you get the money for free ? 
  i 'm not normally such a capitalist but that 's what would happen . 
  however , i do applaud countries who genuinely want to look after all their citizens unlike places like the uk and usa who only want to look after well off people . 
  i believe the finnish government have proposed paying $ 800 per month to everyone for free ? 
  edit : see this link : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate the initial link was just homicide but the trend is similar . 
  [ here is a map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:map_of_world_by_intentional_homicide_rate.svg ) showing intentional homicide rates using a gun ( murder rate per 100,000 inhabitants in 2012 ) . 
  the murder rate has no correlation to gun ownership . 
  europe overall , jointly with oceania , has the second lowest rate of homicide involving guns after asia with the americas ( particularly due to the south ) topping the table . 
  it depends where you go in the uk but the price ranges from around # 3 to # 6 ( approx $ 4 and $ 8 ) . 
  they usually sell them in small quantities like 225g and although cheaper than 1kg ( obviously ) they 're relatively more expensive . 
  if you buy 225g from sainsbury 's , for example , you 'll pay # 6 for a kg . 
  bear in mind that fruit and veg in the uk is tax free , we 're clearly being ripped off . 
  they usually become cheaper in summer when we can grown them here , though . 
  i 'm surprised because they are all over . 
  the likes of wimpy and barratt homes buy land and build entire estates in this type of `` new build '' style which already looks outdated . 
  it 's probably more the phrases like `` interracial law '' , `` muslamic infidels '' , and `` muslamic ray guns '' which people mock . 
  did this man predict the future ? 
  has n't the czech republic only recently asked to be called czechia ? 
  indeed . 
  as annoying as it is they have no choice . 
  they now cover 190 countries so securing deals to screen globally would be an absolute nightmare with film and tv studios . 
  that was a great , funny read !, 
  thanks . 
  there 's a stereotype in the uk that germans get up early to put their towels on the sun loungers . 
  i have no idea how true this is because i always refuse to go to resort holidays . 
  any idea ? 
  brits abroad , it depends where you go , but they 're usually the ones getting pissed in the middle of the day . 
  england has a lot of [ these ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@54.5247536,-1.3187698,3a,75y,80.29h,75.97t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sz9fttoweyfiy30qyalncww!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) type of estates for middle-class suburbs . 
  sometimes entire towns spring up over a few years , where everyone 's house looks similar and there 's no character . 
  these houses go for somewhere near # 300,000 !, 
  this place is locally known as `` ingelby toy town '' because of how similar every street is . 
  i live in [ this ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@54.5540626,-1.2429027,3a,75y,323.6h,74.92t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjga4c5m7fseaxgvxzlsu8g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) area . 
  it 's mainly lower-middle to middle class families ( i come from a working class background but i rent a property here ) . 
  it 's quite typical of a just-outside-of-town suburb in the north of england , but this area is sandwiched between two relatively rough council estates , yet it 's one of the priciest areas . 
  it 's important to note that `` there is only one rule of law in our country , which provides rights and security for every citizen '' so hopefully this practice will be outlawed soon . 
  all this bigot hype about [ `` muslamic infidel '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjunuqiev8m ) law being in the uk is not so much hype , it seems . 
  we have council tax in the uk which is based on property value but it 's for the local council , police and fire services . 
  once you pay off your mortgage here the property is yours and there 's no other charges ( unless it 's a leasehold ) . 
  the council can technically use your home to pay off arrears but that would only happen in extreme cases . 
  you ca n't trust twitter . 
  if you did you would expect justin bieber to be president of the world with one direction as his main advisers . 
  on top of that social media is full of a loud minority of bigots who , i assume , support the out campaign . 
  people who will vote in probably do n't have much to shout about because there not voting for change . 
  i am not 100 % sure what i think because most media reports i see in the uk are about the stupid stuff trump does . 
  last night i seen something about a protester in a rally and trump said something a 5 year old child would say ; something along the lines of `` go home to mommy '' and then `` he 's here because he ca n't get a date '' . 
  this man has potential to become president of the usa , i just do n't know what to say . 
  it 's entertaining in a weird way . 
  although berlin is the capital it 's not the most affluent place in germany , whereas warsaw is the most affluent place in poland . 
  either that or property in warsaw is just smaller ( as the map is based on cost per square meter ) . 
  it 's rare in the uk that the owner of the flat will have anything to do with the freehold . 
  it 's usually owned by a private firm/individual who charges a service charge and possibly even takes money for repairs to the building . 
  these are the reasons i would never buy a flat in the uk ( on top of the fact that build quality is terrible and you can almost always hear your neighbours ! ), 
  it 's possible for the leaseholders of flats to pull together to jointly buy the freehold but that 's very rare , similar to what you have with condos . 
  we have shared ownership schemes here , where you can buy 25 % and upwards of a property and then pay rent on the rest . 
  they 're designed for people who ca n't afford a full mortgage and have a small deposit , and i imagine they 're going to become more popular in london with the silly prices there . 
  no , i did n't say that , but the benefit cuts affect people in high cost of living areas more than anywhere else essentially forcing them out . 
  london will be the place most affected further making it a city for the wealthy only .
