  writing down a random portion and keeping it in your wallet would be a good response to it security-wise . 
  remembering 10 random characters every 3 months is possible if it 's used frequently , but it 'll still need to be kept on paper for a while whilst you learn it , and is open to people using poor choices ( if they can choose ) or outright rejecting it ( if not ) . 
  and your forgotten password process is itself something which can be attacked , more easily so the more often it is used and the simpler/cheaper it has to be . 
  did a 12 year old you have a lot of access to office drawers in sensitive environments ? 
  if it 's in your drawer it 's your co-workers who are the big risk , i 'd have thought . 
  the 12 year old is more likely to attack remotely . 
  that 's why a good password in your wallet is better than a bad one in your head . 
  the access card around your neck and a bad password in your head are even better - even a key logger or camera wo n't get that , and employees ca n't share them for long - but it departments would rather push their security costs elsewhere than spend the money and organisational effort to make that happen . 
   i 'd fire anyone who does that . 
  i would n't , it seems like an almost reasonable response to an unworkable policy imposed from on high that achieves nothing of value . 
  the world is full of organisations that only survive because people work around impossible rules that no-one seems able to change , but do so in ` accepted ' ( by those around them ) ways . 
  that 's why a work-to-rule is a thing . 
  ( i say ` almost reasonable ' because writing down * part * of the passwords and remembering the other part would be more sensible , and because keeping it in your drawer and showing someone else is not so good ) . 
  it makes me wonder if you could sue if you were sacked for it , on the grounds that it 's a near impossible task . 
  it 's also pointless : changing your password every month does nothing useful . 
  installing readers that use your door entry cards would , but of course does n't happen because nobody cares enough to spend actual money . 
  most likely the uk would barely , if at all , spend any time inside the eu after the agreement had come in to force . 
  and the other party to the trade talks is not going to give up a single thing to get fleeting access to the british market - the agreement will be built on what the eu27 offer - so it makes no sense for british interests to be taken in to account in what the eu asks for . 
  whatever interests the uk might push would simply be ignored by the rest of the eu , who would not get a single thing in exchange for agreeing to further them . 
  a more sensible outcome would be for the uk to withdraw from discussing future eu trade agreements ( or trade agreements starting after brexit ) in exchange for permissions to start agreeing its own post-brexit agreements . 
  a quirk of uk energy prices of about 12p/kwh is that 365 \\* 24 \\* 0.12 = ~ 1000 ... so 1 watt used continuously for a year costs about # 1 . 
  so if you can guess the percentage of the time you use something you can guess the cost quite easily from what 's written on the box . 
  apparently that 's a [ molar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molar_concentration ) . 
  presumably that 's either people made of 6x10 ^ 23 african particles per litre , or it 's 6x10 ^ 23 immigrants in a litre . 
   in particular , the british regressive property tax is something i 've never heard of before . 
  that 's just damned remarkable . 
  i 'm amazed that the non-wealthy are willing to put up with that . 
  there used to be a tax based on a percentage of the rental value of each property . 
  margaret thatcher abolished that and replaced it with a poll tax - a fixed amount paid by each adult ( with some reductions for particularly low incomes ) . 
  up with that the non-wealthy did indeed not put . 
  there were riots , lots of non-payment and it was one of the big things that lead to thatcher 's resignation . 
  unfortunately , people did n't non-up-put well enough and settled for the council tax as a replacement . 
  your ` about 1 % of value ' estimate does n't capture its regressiveness completely - it 's a tax levied by local government , and the bands reflect local property values . 
  so , a cheap house in an even cheaper county - in the north east , say - gets taxed more than an expensive one in a very expensive county in the south east . 
  local governments get some , but not all , of their funding from this tax . 
  central government grants to local government have been cut ( by a lot ) , leading to increases in this tax recently - simultaneously with failing roads , poor social care for the elderly ( and high costs on hospitals who ca n't discharge elderly patients with no-one to look after them ) and generally poor services . 
   how can this possibly be legal ? 
  [ looks to me like it quite possibly is n't ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/35 ), 
   which is why the snp asked for one right now even though the polls are n't in there favour . 
  and also because it 'll make scottish interest more prominent in the withdrawal negotiations . 
  theresa may has already said that keeping the uk together will be a priority . 
  currencies are n't a poll on economic competence . 
  if the us starts to borrow a great deal more , as trump 's plans seem to suggest , it 'll cause the currency to rise - because it may cause higher interest rates , and because it will lead to overseas lenders buying dollars to lend ( the us savings rate is n't high , so much of it would have to come from abroad ) . 
  he did n't actually say that the uk ` ca n't ' blame the eu , merely that politicians have been wrong in doing so . 
  impressively , the guardian have managed to misrepresent/misquote an [ article ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/24/europe-eu-european-union-60-years-old ) that they themselves have published . 
   has he not been paying attention ? 
  the media and politicians there have been doing it for decades . 
  if you [ read what he actually wrote ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/24/europe-eu-european-union-60-years-old ) instead of trusting the headline then it 's quite obvious he knows that . 
  he did n't say that the uk ` ca n't ' blame the eu , he said that , for example :  `` brussels '' should not have been constantly blamed in british political discourse for things the eu is not responsible for : we now know the result of such rhetoric . 
  for example , the eu has few powers in three of the four most controversial areas of policy in uk elections : healthcare , education and welfare . 
  and that  it is also the uk that decides on the structural economic issues that have led to high demand from british employers for migrant labour . 
  [ gats ] ( https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/serv_e/gatsqa_e.htm ) is about services . 
  but , still , being outside a whole range of eu arrangements for particular industries is not going to make trade in services easier ... 
  a highly one-sided outcome of a negotiation is one which is vulnerable to be persistently undermined and breached , and one which will make forming new agreements for mutual gain much harder . 
  a perfect deal would be one which captures all possible gains from agreement , including ones neither side thought of at the outset , distributes them in a way which makes the agreement durable and does so whilst improving the relationship and enhancing future cooperation rather than inhibiting it . 
  it would also be one made quickly and efficiently . 
  ones based on repeatedly stating positions and demanding concessions , ` positional bargaining ' , are not good at achieving this . 
  it 's slow - extracting concessions is hard - and it can break relationships . 
  meanwhile , no amount of good negotiating will undo a power imbalance . 
  it might find more mutual gains , it might distribute them more in your favour , but if you have little power you 'll get little out of it - and if you have a lot , you 'll get a lot . 
  the whole notion of locating * this * profit and * that * profit in * this * country and * that * country is a failure . 
  maybe taxes should be on payments to shareholders and bondholders instead , in the holder 's own jurisdiction . 
  it 'd be much easier to collect , and much easier to work out the amount . 
  it also makes international tax competition much , much harder . 
  from what i remember , even hmrc , the uk tax authority , has been known to avoid taxes . 
  ( unfortunately , i ca n't find any articles on it because google is too keen on returning results about avoiding the attention of hmrc , not about hmrc itself - it was some sort of building sale and lease back arrangement , i think ) . 
  it makes the individual manager/organization look good and it makes his budget go further . 
  it possibly also makes the company look more valuable , too , should they wish to sell it . 
  let 's hope so . 
  it wo n't be as simple as it first appears , but i hope that wo n't get in the way . 
  in particular , these questions come up : * will affected people have the same rights they do now ? 
  - for example , limiting the ability of the uk government to deport people who have committed crimes or who are non-eea family members of eea citizens * students and the self-sufficient without ` comprehensive sickness insurance ' are not covered by the eu freedom of movement rules - but this is currently ignored by the uk , other than for obtaining permanent resident status ( partly because they still have a right of entry so they can come straight back - but this right will disappear ) . 
  what will happen to them ? 
  * what will happen to the permanent resident status and the process for getting citizenship ? 
  * will it remain illegal to discriminate against those people in the job market and in product/service markets ( like housing ) ? 
  * how will this be interpreted and enforced ? 
  the ecj ? 
  i 'm sure there 's more , and that it may relate to other parts of the withdrawal agreement , too ( health and pension provision , maybe ? ), 
   volatility is pretty big and you have to pay big transfer costs when you are buying and selling . 
  ... and in the uk that includes stamp duty . 
  that 's # 10k when you buy a # 400k house , # 20k for # 600k . 
  it 's a senseless , badly designed tax that impedes labour mobility and unfairly penalizes those who have to move frequently . 
  since language is itself a cultural artifact , maybe they want students to use a randomly chosen language for each word they speak . 
  but with one in seven words from somewhere in papua new guinea . 
  yankification ? 
  the ` z ' form was far more prevalent than the 's ' one in british english books in 1800 , and it has been more prevalent for all but 40 years since then . 
  [ graph here ] ( https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=civilised%2ccivilized&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=18&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3b%2ccivilised%3b%2cc0%3b%2cs0%3b%3bcivilised%3b%2cc0%3b%3bcivilised%3b%2cc0%3b.t4%3b%2ccivilized%3b%2cc0%3b%2cs0%3b%3bcivilized%3b%2cc0%3b%3bcivilized%3b%2cc0 ) i would n't have thought there was much american influence on british spelling in 1800 . 
  i 'm sure we wo n't run out of toilet paper , i 'm thinking more of highly perishable goods imported by road + ship from the eu and temporary shortages that happen as people find alternative import channels . 
  there 's also an ongoing shortage of hgv drivers which could be worsened by bad immigration controls . 
  there 's a lot we 'll need in order to be able to move goods freely through our ports . 
  it systems , space for checks at ports , etc. 
  those things will be much harder if there 's no agreement allowing goods to be cleared somewhere other than at the end of a big queue at the border . 
  this was the post about it : https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/5nwvid/one_reason_why_may_cannot_just_walk_away_if_she/ its not likely to be a problem if an agreement is reached ( and i would expect a withdrawal agreement to be reached ) . 
  but if one is n't reached there 'll be upset hauliers and higher than necessary cost increases for their customers ( and so probably for consumers ) . 
  there will be an awful lot of details which people could get upset over and/or personally affected by . 
  think of the recognition of hgv licences that was discussed on here ( or maybe it was ukpolitics ) a while ago , or of the problems we might face if ports are not prepared in time and we get no agreements to help goods move smoothly . 
  shortages of goods or big increases in hauliers costs would not go unnoticed , even if they 're temporary . 
  nor would problems with migration laws . 
  people will get angry if they see their friends , colleagues and families being treated badly , or if social or health care gets even worse because recruitment gets slower and more expensive . 
  that 's just the withdrawal agreement - if we add the trade agreement , too , the biggest chunk of anger will come from people who lose their jobs .
