  you want to deport all muslims ? 
   make europe great again some austrian dude had this idea in the 30s , did n't work out too well ... 
  did they surrender ? 
  languages being related does n't mean they 're mutually intelligible , it just means they had a common origin . 
  for instance english is a germanic language , but that does n't mean i can speak german . 
  russian is indeed a lot further removed from czech than these other languages , because it is an east slavic language while czech and the others are west slavic . 
  [ this tree showing the relationship between the balto-slavic languages ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:slavic_languages_tree.svg ) might interest you . 
   russian is literally is as far from these two as is german and turkish . 
  [ ackchyually ] ( http://new3.fjcdn.com/comments/for+you+_97b2c8495c0b1a4c491e3fda235808ce.jpg ) ... russian , czech , and slovak are all slavic languages from the indo-european family . 
  german is a germanic language from the indo-european family . 
  turkish is an oghuz language from the turkic family , which has completely different origins . 
  so in fact , even * german * is closer to russian than it is to turkish . 
  both countries are in the schengen area , how is this allowed ? 
   i know that ive yet to see an ugly czech guy or czech girl . 
  the country must have one of the highest concentrations of hot people you 'll find anywhere . 
  it should go back to bohemia , cause that name sounds rad as hell . 
  but honestly , if the slovak republic is called slovakia then the czech republic should really be called czechia . 
  it 's just cleaner . 
  what did this apparent genocide advocate 's comment say before they deleted it ? 
  bollocks . 
  if an ethnic group 's very existence disturbs you , that makes you a racist by definition . 
  edit : implicitly calling for a very literal white genocide , and not in the alt-right sense . 
  way to not be racist . 
  because white people do not oppress black people simply by fucking existing . 
  that 's because they 're shit and their ideology is shit, 
  but `` their side '' did win , * in france * . 
  by a landslide . 
  the centrist won , the protofash lost . 
  freddy starr ate mine, 
  you 're certainly not the first austrian to hate diversity, 
  was france ever segregated ? 
  apart from under the nazis obviously, 
  exactly how the fuck would that have influenced the mayor of france ? 
  \\  literal fucking segregation \\  cultural acceptance pick one, 
  that 's really interesting , why was that ? 
  so you 're from * british * island ... off the coast of * south america * ... and you care enough about the american president to make that your username . 
  or we do n't allow political ads at all, 
   i heard that gold pays for comparatively little , most of the money is in ads . 
  right , but not * per user * . 
  the reason ads make up most of reddit 's revenue is because of the sheer volume of users who see them . 
  if you buy gold , reddit is making more off you than they do off a non-gold-but-ad-viewing user . 
  / r/catholicism, 
  i think it 's a eurovision joke, 
  leftist here . 
  hmm i wonder what their ulterior motive behind banning ( ( ( circumcision ) ) ) may be ... 
   paul joseph watson did a good job hahahahahahahahaha, 
  right , but * is * there mercury in the water ? 
  that is what seems to be the ridiculous part . 
  remove kebab from the venices, 
  by that definition , we do n't vote for our leading party either . 
  tories won in 2015 with the same percentage as the nsdap in 1932 . 
  \\  france \\  queen trust an englishman not to know the first thing about french history, 
  you want a [ vpn ] ( https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/ ) , then, 
  was he any more of a homophobe than anyone else at the time ? 
  i mean i get what you 're saying but by that logic gay people ca n't wear historical figures on their shirts full stop . 
  do you want a civil war because that 's how you get a civil war, 
  pretty sure that ship has sailed, 
  if you 're \\  a \\  fucking \\  leaf then why do you give enough of a fuck about american politics to have that username,

   le pen will at most win first round but certainly loose second round so untwist your knickers . 
  `` we 're * certainly * going to vote to remain in europe '' `` trump will at most win the primaries - he 'll * certainly * lose to hillary '' `` lol as if the turks are just gon na vote away their democracy '', 
   grab them by the pussy  racist look i agree with you but take that one out for fuck sake, 
  to be fair , turkey is in nato . 
  congratulating a nato leader for defeating a coup ( regardless of how staged it may or may not have been ) is slightly different from congratulating someone on '' '' `` winning '' '' '' a referendum to basically become a dictator . 
  gorsuch is n't * that * bad . 
  trump could have picked someone a lot worse . 
  well the constitution ca n't be amended on the strength of a freaking referendum , certainly . 
  and they ca n't jail political opponents , so there 's that . 
  holy fuck you know times are dire when serbs are sympathising with kebabs, 
   it seems like the more authoritarian he becomes the weaker he and his party gets . 
  and that 's exactly why he is dangerous . 
  weak leaders tend to be bigger cunts , to put it mildly . 
  i do n't think that would be on the cards even with a no vote , to be honest . 
  tl ; dr : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mhusgl9bem, 
  yes , the victory of erdogan is truly an italian tragedy . 
   if you 'd need a 2/3 majority for important questions women wouldnt be allowed to vote in switzerland to this day . 
  i get your point but do you seriously think over 1/3 of swiss men are against women 's suffrage today ? 
   direct democracy only works in highly educated nations and under the restriction that at least a 2/3 majority should be required . 
  direct democracy works pretty well in switzerland and they only require a simple majority . 
   if his team had won , they 'd have a majority by over three million votes which is still only 2 % , same margin as brexit , and also * not * a majority . 
  hillary got 48 % . 
   technically austro-hungarian if we 're being * really * technical , just austrian ... he was born in 1856 , and it was the austrian empire until 1867 :\\ ^ ),

  or maybe it 's in date by 80, 
  to be fair , the word `` croatian '' is usually what triggers people .
