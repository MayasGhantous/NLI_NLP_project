apple was one of the first corporations do this , they effectively set the precedent . 
  i have n't seen anyone else point out how simply having more children to pay for your old age is mankind 's biggest pyramid scheme . 
  you ca n't just go on and on having more worker 's to support the previously larger work force for ever . 
  putin is not an inch removed from reality or his mental sanity . 
  he is an incredibly cunning and smart man . 
  there are many things do dislike about him and his work but to think him as `` mad '' is to massively underestimate him . 
  and being underestimated makes a victory easier for a skilled tactician like him . 
  best use of apc 's i can think of , extreme grocery delivery !, 
  made me chuckle xd but imo to other people armored paddy wagons ( police 4x4 ) probably seem quite militaristic . 
  also seen a few cops with heckler & koch g36 's standing about university area occasionally , one was even leaning on a starbucks wall . 
  just for a spit second it made me feel odd how a military weapon seemed to be protecting what can be argued one of most capitalist chain stores int he world xd, 
  ah oh , i completely agree . 
  it was just the way you worded it about a choice made me raise an eyebrow , 
  so are you one of the people who signed the daily mail petition to spend foreign aid money on flood relief instead ? 
  i just do n't feel flooded homes of us british is the same as say the hurricane in the philippines , especially when a fund already exists to pay for it . 
  as someone from northern ireland , i think it is almost certainly from the mainland . 
  our population is only 2 million versus the 60 + million of gb to have much of an effect . 
  everyone in northern ireland is also a irish republic citizen automatically if they so wish to get the passport ( i hold both uk and irish ) , so even then a good proportion of ni emigration to the republic would not show up on this map . 
  your are also forgetting that republic of ireland was a powerhouse economy until the financial crash and had some of the best wages and highest standards of living in the eu . 
  also it is the closest other nation geographically and probably socially - i.e. 
  we both drink millions of liters of tea . 
  finally , in my opinion the most important factor for british emigration ( for work rather than holiday homes in spain ) is we speak english as our first language , foreign language skills are on the whole something the uk does not excel in - its much to easy to only know english . 
  im going there in a bit over a months time ... * swaps to using his irish passport *, 
  it 's all yours . 
  seriously . 
  i give you a week before you [ give up and leave  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xnhfi.gif ), 
  sorry if i did n't make it clear but that was my point exactly , that comment was an example of an abusive type of comment that gets down voted , supporting m129k 's comment :  ( they often come across as slightly aggressive about it , too the second quote was to show how pro-eu bias can down vote a reasonable , informed opinion as it does not conform to the consensus . 
  as many users have already pointed out , there is little reason to join a sub-reddit about a topic you do not like , so if one does not like europe , there is little reason to talk here . 
  secondly , although i can not find the link anymore ( it was either about users per country here or number of flairs per country ) but quite a lot of users here are from the usa and could be called `` euro-files '' and thus are here out of interest in europe but essentially have no interest/understanding of its internal issues . 
  while i agree that what / u/llanita says is a genuine concern about pro-eu bias causing dismissal of anti-eu arguments , a pinch of salt must be taken with both . 
  / u/m129k point is proved by the most down voted comment on this thread as of 1.20 am gmt :  because reddit is a leftoid shithole and we all know how much leftoids love dictatorships . 
  where as / u/llanita point is proved by the second most down voted comment :  all of reddit has it 's biases . 
  / r/politics likes the democrats ( well , hates republicans anyway ) , / r/movies loves michael fassbender and idris elba , and / r/europe is pro-eu . 
  and dissenting views tend to be drowned out . 
  and when i say `` proved '' i merely mean supported by a single instance each , not conclusive ofc . 
  do n't be silly . 
  everyone knows norway is an island nation floating on a sea of oil out in the middle of the arctic !, 
  i think you mean not part of * britain * , it still can be ** british ** . 
  [ the difference between the united kingdom , great britain and england explained ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnu8xdbsn10 ), 
  and you are the annoyance of every irish person  american : `` oh yea my great great grandfather was from ( insert tiny town name ) so that makes me irish !! '', 
  irish : oh , yea guess so , * shuffles off *, 
  no one cares about galway , so its entirly possible there was one an no one noticed !, 
  all the cool people live on the east coast - dublin & belfast xd, 
  [ but what if its this plate ?!!,

  as someone from ireland , the only completely white state , sucks to be rest of yous , 
  i was going to defend you by saying its nice to have one to get cold water for a drink , but they i realized iv only one tap in the kitchen . 
  i literally never even thought about it till now . 
  it is indeed well outdated xd, 
  trust me , there are plenty within it that are fully aware of that fact and cringe when `` they '' start shouting about either side : /, 
  * that the united kingdom includes northern ireland , scotland , wales and england , not only england . 
  * ^ eye ^ twitch * * tea is ubiquitous and omnipresent at every level in society , and is glorious . 
  * the bbc makes some of the best television in the world . 
  * the nhs is a national treasure and everyone is getting a bit ruffled about it changing . 
  * empire and imperialism where britain 's specialist subjects . 
  * largest navy in the world until some years after ww2 and british shipping once made 2/3 of all shipping on earth . 
  * unfortunately ( personally speaking ) very skeptical of the eu and is still rather worried/paranoid about slipping from world importance . 
  * the royal family being more german than english . 
  * that the british army originally came to northern ireland in the 60 's to defend catholics - who made them tea on the streets as thanks , seriously . 
  * some of the best music and bands world has ever known . 
  * that the united kingdom may not be so united if scotland leaves . 
  * sought to privatize everything it possible could under thatcher 's neo-liberal ideals . 
  * permanent member of un security council & a nuclear state . 
  * gives itself a hemorrhage over immigration / multicultural society but is n't doing to bad . 
  * everyone hates everyone else in london and no one dares talk on the tube . 
  * in a half joking way , hates on the french who shares in the theatrical hatred and sees germany as their main enemy who does n't really care . 
  * complains about the weather if its raining or sunny . 
  * uk has common law while most of europe has civil law . 
   county meath woops , i read the headline as armagh ... 
  i have no idea how lol . 
  shh you still have donegal do n't you !? 
  haha that 's very true !, 
  but best tourist story i think we had recently was all your english cops coming over here for the g8 . 
  first few days you could seem them just waiting to be attacked , and then after they realized about 4 people in all of the country were protesting they sat on the grass eating ice cream and picking daisies , was hilarious !, 
  but yea , il be probably be over following the great irish tradition of stealing english jobs in the future xd, 
  interesting , thanks !, 
  i just could n't think of anyone beyond the super-rich chinese who could afford to pay it all in cash , i guess half of houses bought may not actually be that many though . 
  how and/or why where homes bought in cash ? 
  are they very very cheap or what ? 
  i did not know about slayer , dang : /, 
  what happens if you try posting it from northern ireland \u0ca0_\u0ca0 : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-23727511, 
  noting that this is ** northern ireland ** , as my flair is uk . 
  * week of rioting in belfast after loyalists blocked a republican march on 9th august injuring 56 officers , which has been a continuation of rioting since 12th of july when loyalists have their main parade . 
  * controlled detonation on a bomb found in county meath * pipe bomb left at a fair ground made safe by army . 
  * bbc in england to be fined # 5000 for `` stupidly '' sparking a bomb scare in manchester after they raised the alarm when a camera in a bottle ( which was something they ordered ) arrived with postage from northern ireland . 
  * kings of leon , the vaccines , the undertones and the minutes , snow patrol , jason mraz , kodaline , foy vance , avicii , tinie tempah , rudimental , naughty boy and tommy trash played at tennent 's vital in belfast  * and in light news , man jailed for 9 months for stealing a tortoise from pet shop that he then sold for # 60 to pay for alcohol . 
  awwww , northern ireland , there to make the rest of western europe feel safe in comparison . 
  edit : added tennent 's vital and words, 
  iv been to that castle !, 
  i even got locked in a wooden cage for a photo there !, 
  would be an awesome place for a concert indeed , lovely place .

  oh i know , i was referring to how some believe the irish state started to interfere with the contest so they would stop wining as it was costing them to much to sustain xd, 
  anything that might make the uk get points . 
  or ireland win . 
  no , you are not the fattest europeans on this rank table !, 
  * investment in education * infrastructure * manufacturing or ` real production ' industries ( in creating things that further development e.g. 
  specialist machinery , which is n't to say service economy is not important ) * environmental consciousness * apfelwein * organisation / efficiency * ** rammstein **, 
  just a point , its `` ukraine '' not the * the * ukraine as the prefix was added by the soviets to make it sound more like a geographical region instead of a nation so russia could exert more dominance over it . 
  [ and just like the american flag raising this is copying , it too was fake and posed for the camera .
