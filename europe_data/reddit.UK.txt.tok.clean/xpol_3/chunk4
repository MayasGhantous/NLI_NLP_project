  that giant thick electrical cable should have been worrisome however . 
  nuclear weapons make a nation powerful ; it 's that simple . 
  it 's very nice to day dream about at a peace loving utopian world but realpolitik is still extremely present and will be for a long time to come . 
  nor i but it 's a key part of the areas history ; eminem even had a short lyric mentioning the city . 
  it 's literally that famous . 
  also was huge in 80 's in a similar way sarajevo was due to conflict . 
  trees bulge where they are weak to create better support . 
  so because this tree is on thin rocky soil it 's bulged to be wider at the bottom to reduce it 's changes of falling over . 
  they were doing it before it was cool ; how could they be more hipster ? 
  [ this ] ( https://cdn.dotcomgiftshop.com/sites/dotcom.pleasetest.co.uk/files/styles/uc_product_full/public/cream%20ceramic%20butter%20dish.jpg?itok=8m_pe-3r ) is a normal irish and british butter dish ; you use 'd them when your butter came wrapped in paper instead of in a plastic container . 
  basicaly the plastic container like [ this ] ( http://grocerytrader.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/butter-tub-new-lid.jpg ) made them extinct outside hipsters with 100 % organic pure milk butter . 
  my granny used to have one ; have n't seen one in real life for ~ 20 years . 
  indeed , as long as it is not repetitive or that could be abuse . 
  well the us is making their laws apply globally - france has every justification in doing the same . 
  i do n't agree with the law but france has is legally correct . 
  sexist . 
  that simple . 
  are they going to introduce arab-free trains too ? 
  of course not , yet classing all men as walking violence machines is fine and dandy . 
  fair enough , never heard about that . 
  it was the american ar 's and libyan shipment of russian made weapons but the soviets/russians did n't provide any armaments that i am aware of ? 
  about 100 people were killed in the british mainland relating to the troubles so the vast majority of those deaths are in northern ireland . 
  a shitty time nonetheless . 
  i would be shocked if most of the major powers did n't have loads of spies ( informants would be a better word i think ) in their foreign office . 
  standard operating procedure imo . 
  if they are fleeing war ; why do they have to go to the heart of europe ? 
  greece is very safe . 
  because all of those things are done but covert agencies . 
  if you knew about them all then they would be useless . 
  in a few decades maybe ; were kinda busy atm . 
  all of which is already done . 
  indeed , what a pack of cunts . 
  tax haven * no ty ; i will stick to promoting industries that actually contribute to society and the workforce . 
  i think it 's true for a lot of organisations ; but when the top levels are shit the actual worker has to come up with solutions to problems that never should have existed . 
  i 'm frankly impressed they managed to cobble together a jet from scrap . 
  but if it * is * 50 % it 's probably over it ; even by a tiny amount . 
  50.000000001 % is still a majority . 
  contrary to popular belief it 's really hard to poison tap water ( luckily ) as you would need tankers of the chemical to keep a concentration high enough to pose any risk in the short term . 
  would be a good fear tactic though . 
  motorways and muck is what we call them . 
  it 's either 3 lanes wide or it 's a pile of shit . 
  the government [ killed ] ( http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-21-at-10.05.57-500x344.png ) public housing in the 80 's because home-ownership makes people more right-leaning and so it was a political boon for the tories . 
  they used the excuse that the free market would correct for the loss in supply and make better housing . 
  this has been proven without a doubt to be bullshit . 
  the private sectors competition for price just died and the value they can get out of land and property is best exploited by not building to many - keeping the supply constricted . 
  because no one has had the balls to do anything about if for decades it has gotten to the stage were if the public sector steps back in again with significant public housing then the housing market will crash ** hard ** , ala ; new recession . 
  so the government is going to continue to sit on it 's hands until the bubble pops on it 's own because it will , it has to , at some point the top will be reached and it will crash and burn . 
  the country is domianted by middle aged house owners who link their ego and self worth to their house price . 
  no young person can afford a house in any decent sized city ; it is simply not affordable in any definition of the term - the upcoming generation is and will pay so much in rent it will kill our consumer spending and hurt the economy long term . 
  i for one am saving up to get the fuck out of here ; i refuse to be coerced into paying through the nose for a place to live because of short-sighted policies . 
  why ? 
  the government makes the planning regulations ; it could easily permit social housing exclusions under some circumstances . 
  this is an excuse for politicians not wanting to do anything because it * will * hurt peoples house price and people 's ego and lives are now linked to house value in this country . 
  not that simple ; british and irish had been trading and moving to each other for millennia - sea travel was way easier than overland travel for 99 % of human history . 
  it 's irrelevant anyway because even if 100 % of the british ( actually scottish really ) came during the plantation they are here now ; it 's dumb to blame people ancestors for where they are born . 
  we would rather have peace than a bit of cloth ; 70 % of the entire population of northern ireland agree with that ; it 's our choice - both catholic and protestant . 
  and then get rid of the north , then the west , then anyone who has to strong an accent . 
  fuck it ; might as well just declare london and independent nation !, 
  last thing we need is an other massively corrupt nation . 
  i 's be happy to see it join ; once it 's actually ready to . 
   military and police have been onsite since the weekend , she added . 
  employees who are not needed to run the two power plants are now leaving the sites . 
  does that mean they had intelligence something was going to happen ? 
  northern ireland is ** not ** ireland . 
  it 's a separate state in which about half feel irish and half feel british ; to you we may be all irish but the northern part is an important distinction for a lot of people . 
  imagine that the turkish in bulgaria were 50 % of the population and a near civil war had been going on between them and bulgarians ( ethnic ) for 30 odd years ; a `` bulgarian '' flag might be hard to agree on . 
  the flag you mean is the saint patrick 's saltire . 
  this was the flag used by the british ruling class in ireland during british rule and is not acceptable to any nationalists north or south . 
  that flag is basically an english flag for ireland not an irish flag . 
  it does n't have one because the first one you linked ( the ulster banner ) is seen as the flag of a protestant government that oppressed catholics . 
  it was removed as official in 1972 after protests . 
  the latter flag you linked ( saint patrick 's saltire ) was the flag used by the british ruling class in ireland during british rule and is not acceptable to any nationalists north or south . 
  no agreeable flag compromise has been found that is neither to irish nor too british and thus no flag has been chosen ; i ca n't see one being picked any time soon either . 
  the british union jack is the flag flown on government buildings ( only sometimes allowed ) . 
  flags are extremely touchy subject here . 
  not my country but there was a street in leuven , belgium called rapengang that i found bizarre enough tot stop me in my tracks . 
   pseudo university within top 200 world universities ; hardly pseudo . 
  i also happened to go outside the campus you know . 
   we 've territory in the middle of the pacific and in latin america your right that is totally irrelevant as france is in fact a separate nation to belgium . 
  look your a clearly a rampant nationalist ; europe does n't need more of your mind set . 
  yes as i said ; brussels capital region is one of the 3 parts of the belgian national government ; of which the walloon community is part - along with the flemish community . 
  the wallons are not 2/3 of the federal government . 
  well considering i was at the vrije universiteit brussel for some time i do n't consider myself too uneducated about the topic . 
  i am also keenly aware of sections of societies trying to create dominance over others by refusing to integrate ; brussels is jointly wallonian and flemish no matter how much you do n't like it . 
  not that it matters , but least you forget the capital region is also wholly located in flanders, 
  i 'm pretty sure brussels is the ` brussels capital region ' ; one of the 3 federal parts of belgium . 
  creating random organisations with brussels doe 's not suddenly mean wallonia own 's it , everything is officially bilingual . 
  the only reason it may feel more french is because walloons are to uptight to speak anything else , claiming this makes it wallonian it 's the equivalent of putting our fingers in your ears and shouting . 
  and before that it was controlled by the carthage , then the romans , visigoths then byzantium ; your always going to have to pick an arbitrary point in time to claim ownership and it 's probably going to be a moment that favours your particular view . 
  and yeah northern ireland has a clause that both the uk and ireland ( republic ) agree on that whoever the people of the north decide to be unified with they will recognise it and make it happen . 
  we have chosen to keep the status-quo and not fight over it ; our choice . 
  did i miss the day when brussels was officially annexed by ~ ~ france ~ ~ wallonia ? 
  the best for me is [ macedonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/flag_of_macedonia.svg/2000px-flag_of_macedonia.svg.png ) it 's very geometrically pleasing as well as striking joint place for worst is [ cyprus ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/flag_of_cyprus.svg ) and [ kosovo ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/flag_of_kosovo.svg ) because they both have highly accurate outline of the country on their flag . 
  that 's so silly , at least try to smooth it out and simply it !, 
  honourable mention is northern ireland because it does n't exist ; we do n't have one . 
  oh you think we do ? 
  you think [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/flag_of_northern_ireland.svg/800px-flag_of_northern_ireland.svg.png ) is it ? 
  nope . 
  not been official since 1972 ; by that logic ukraine 's flag could be [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/flag_of_ukrainian_ssr.svg ) . 
  there has simply been no replacement for it since 1972 and so the union jack is the only flag we officially have .
