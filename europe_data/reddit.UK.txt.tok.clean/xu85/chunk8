  but it gives the bbc a handy defence from accusations of a cover-up . 
  * asian is a well-known term for a person of south indian descent !, 
  * right . 
  other crimes more prevalent in certain ethnicities are also hushed up for exactly the same reasons . 
  gun and knife crime in the black community in the uk is well known but not often discussed by a press who do n't want to be seen oppressing a downtrodden minority group . 
  romanian atm and fraud is also rife , yet not really talked about . 
  the only time i 've seen it brought up is when ukips nigel farage forced the issue in a radio debate , and was roundly condemned for `` promoting hostility '' or whatever it is . 
  these facts are a thorn in the side of those who have invested in the ideology of multiculturalism . 
   rolf harris what connection do his crimes have to the bbc ? 
   gary glitter again , what ? 
  he was done for having thousands of kiddy porn images on his pc and sleeping with some underaged prostitutes in cambodia . 
  how are the bbc culpable ? 
   chris denning and dave lee travis do n't know much about these two , i know they were convicted of some offence . 
   a lot of kids got raped by these men without it mattering of race or religion . 
  what does that mean ? 
  these were christian men raping christian girls . 
  that 's as bad as muslim immigrants raping 1400 girls ? 
  tell me something . 
  why do you have such a mental block in assigning more guilt , blame or shame towards the muslim pakistani community for this crime ? 
  is it because the idea that one group , be it an ethnic group or religious , are more of a threat than others ? 
  does this shatter your ideology that we 're all the same , promoting the need for you to practice some mental gymnastics and equate the rape and torture of 1400 girls by muslim immigrants to what chris denning did ? 
  if it was 3,000 girls , would you still be saying the same shit to me ? 
  what about 10,000 ? 
  you know , what gets me is that if it was n't for yewtree , the jay report would never have been released , and we 'd all be none the wiser . 
  your way of thinking filters all the way up to the very top in the uk , cultural marxism thinking permeates every institution from the police to the political establishment . 
  it has become the way things are . 
  we are only allowed to `` attack '' a particular ( non-white ) group as long as a long line of white christian abusers are also brought to light at the same time . . with the underlying aim of dissipating the resulting anger . 
  ammunition must be given to islamic rape apologists in order to promote some weird , misguided sense of `` fairness '' . 
  to attack one ethnic group for barbarous crimes is `` unfair '' , unless that ethnic group is white brits , who are deemed fair game . 
  the [ lra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord's_resistance_army ) consists of about 200 people in the jungle somewhere . 
  [ boko haram ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boko_haram ) has around 10,000 men . 
  what next , are you going to compare isis to westboro baptist church ? 
  you seriously have n't heard about this ? 
  it 's been reported quite a bit in the press , but not as much as it should have , to `` protect community cohesion '' . 
  the men overwhelmingly belong to the pakistani community , yet the bbc habitually describe the perpetrators as `` asian '' . 
  small things like that . 
  google [ rotherham rape scandal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal ) or the jay report . 
   i find digging through someone 's post history because you ca n't refute their current arguments to be a sign of intellectual deficiency : after all , you do n't have the gall to actually challenge the points presented for having the gall to hold insufficiently progressive views on some things , i get people digging through my history too . 
  usually when i come up with fair points and a willingness to engage in reasonable debate . 
  i sometimes get `` ha !, 
  i bet you post to / r/theredpill '' , usually after extensive digging . 
  i never have , but it 's just funny when that 's the extent of their argument . 
  leftists are extremely susceptible to herd and group shaming . 
  this is a trait usually found with women , but increasingly with men now too . 
  they ca n't argue against your points on their own merits . 
  they feel the need to let anyone who is reading that you are of the out-group , and therefore you can all your views will be tainted and you will be pigeonholed in the * irrelevant/bigoted * box . 
  the lack of colonies belonging to germany , who were late to unify , is one of the reasons why they decided to expand their empire in europe during ww2 . 
   romanian  corruption whatatwist.png, 
  how many muslims does finland have , compared to sweden ? 
  what 's the unemployment rate among them ? 
  i 'm guessing that 's why you have less problems with isis . 
  i hear 1/2 of all european is fighters are french !, 
  nordic nations agree ? 
  i guess that means we should do that opposite of whatever they agree on . 
  right ? 
  upvote if * based putin * . 
  downvote if * dae sweden ? 
  dreamland . 
  what content did you find the most `` problematic '' and concerned you the most , captain sweden ? 
  or maybe we should stop promoting this idea that `` everything is equal '' , anything goes and all lifestyles should be tolerated if not embraced . 
  maybe we should leave inequality be . 
  perhaps instead of obsessively wondering why women are only paid 80 % of men in certain industries , we should recognise there are inherent differences between men/women and it 's futile and indeed damaging to enact measures to attempt to equalise the sexes , as many on the left are trying to do . 
  perhaps instead of teaching children to respect all religions equally , we should teach that some religions are more dangerous to the society our forefathers in europe have built up than others , and we in europe are superior to isis , for example . 
  i 'd like to see the data on those polls . 
  i 'm certain those percentages would swing wildly depending on the kind of question asked . 
   none of those facts are enough to challenge the basic principle that a person should have complete authority over their body and everything contained within interesting , i wonder if the majority of reddit would agree with that sounds like the kind of thing you might say as a dependent-less young adult , but might not fully embrace once you start having children and a family and start to live in part for other people . 
  you 're naive if you think once this new in vogue cause is `` equal '' or `` settled '' that 'll be the end of it . 
  there will always be people dedicated to the social justice fight , the new marxists dedicated to `` equalising '' society because they deem one group ( currently straight white men ) to be oppressing everyone else . 
  they have no reason to give up their struggle until every single gay guy in europe no longer feels oppressed . 
  social justice and environmentalism has become an almost religious movement across the west in the last 25 years . 
  if it is n't gay rights , it 'll be climate change , black lives matter , trans rights , the glass ceiling , animal testing rights , asylum rights . . the list is never ending . 
  spot on . 
  it 's also very hard to criticise or oppose the politics of identity . 
  what public figure wants to come out against the gay rights lobby , the trans rights lobby , the womens lib lobby , the [ insert oppressed group here ] lobby . 
  they 'd get holy hellfire rained on them , lose their job , their career , their power , their money , their status , all potentially because of a concerted social media campaign and a few hundred sj activists . 
  so it 's been running free , unconstrained , aided by the filter bubble that is the internet . . inc. reddit  there is no cohesive opposing ideology to the socjus camp who are lobbying our politicians and having amazing success . 
  it 's far too easy to paint anyone who does n't slavishly acquiesce to identity politics as a bigot/homophobe/nazi , so nobody wants to even go there . 
  so progressive . 
  i just shed a single tear of joy . 
  `` would you be equally happy if your son married another man than if he married a woman ? '', 
  do that poll anonymously and see how `` overwhelming '' the support is , 
  meanwhile `` do you believe in respect and equality for all people , regardless of sexuality '' scores 110 % , but `` do you think the government should do more to encourage male-male marriage '' will get about 15 % . 
  [ obligatory ding dong watch this link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0zzjxw4mta ), 
  that 's exactly what i 'm saying . 
  usually if it 's the vast majority , and if `` the agreement '' is contrary to the rest of society , then yes . 
  reddit can often be very passionate about `` defending social justice '' , but most people in the uk do n't really care about it . 
  it just gives metropolitan liberals a worthy cause to fight for . 
  the entire karma system lends itself to creating these jerks , though , so i recognise it has to go either one way or another . 
  `` are you saying the holocaust is a joke ? '', 
  do n't particular care to be honest i just like mocking reddit circlejerks . 
  right , let me go full / r/circlebroke and analyse the top voted comments : 1 ) so predictable ( * wink wink * ) 2 ) this really exposes where the borders of europe really exists nowadays . 
  ( * those backwards , unprogressive hordes . 
  barely human . 
  * ) 3 ) fucking shambolic of india , such a shame ( * how dare india hold socially conservative views . 
  animals * ) 4 ) nice to see us on the right side . 
  ( * it 's not a matter of opinion anymore , there is no debate , we on the progressive left have divided it into ` right/wrong ' * ) 5 ) i think this map should be the basis on aid decisions , all red countries are eligible to recieve aid from the west and the rest can go fuck themselves . 
  ( * hold views deemed insufficiently progressive to metropolitan lefties ? 
  no monies for you !, 
  * ) 6 ) this really shows the current state of the world and how its split , not just on gay issues but i also think in general western ideals . 
  ( * red good green bad * ) 7 ) shame on you nicaragua ( * usual sjw tactic , if all else fails , shame your opponent as literally nazis/biggots * ),
