`` paid for by international donors '' . 
  it 's a very misleading headline imo , as it 's not lebanon providing the education , but international donors ... and the biggest donor is the eu . 
  it 's easy to ` host ' hundreds of thousands of refugees in temporary camps when someone else pays the bills . 
  welcoming refugees in the european sense - i.e. 
  integrating them fully into our society , with the same rights and rewards as any other citizen - is a lot trickier and a lot more expensive . 
   nor is he a immigrant . 
  yes , i am sure everyone in that photo is a native-born german . 
  after they were done with that demonstration they probably donned their leiderhosen and headed out for bratwurst . 
  e : of course i am being facetious , but how are you so certain that none of these folks are immigrants just because the photo is taken in 2012 ? 
  breaking news : picture that claims to show islamist immigrants in germany attacking police in 2015 actually shows islamist immigrants in germany attacking police in 2012 comprehensive refutation there , good job indy journos, 
  my mum joined a local gun club when she retired to france , she shoots a .357 magnum ( revolver ) at a 25m range . 
  i 've been along a couple of times to have a go but my eyesight is too terrible to be much good ... 
  i 've figured out that in case of zombie apocalypse i should wait until they are closer than 10m before trying to fire . 
  not sure how common it is in other countries , but i was a bit shocked to find see the bar attached to the range ... 
  guess i should have expected it in rural france , but it did feel a little bit odd to see the old soaks of the village throwing glasses of wine down their necks at 11am before sending a few rounds downrange . 
  great to see people having the courage to take their destinies into their own hands , to riot and fight against authorities unfairly holding them back from improving their living conditions . 
  it 's only a shame they did n't have the same courage to fight to improve their lives in their own countries ... 
  do you have a link to either of these ? 
  saw one on the front page with a video from another angle but it was gone when i refreshed, 
   incriminating documents then , finally , we might have enough evidence to condemn the nazis ... ? 
  i do n't really see it as a shame : it 's easy to criticise today , but it was the economic reality at the time . 
  we [ bought their freedom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compensated_emancipation ) ( and then ` encouraged ' others to follow our lead ) to ensure the transition would be peaceful ... 
  i think if we 'd have just said `` all slaves to be freed , no compensation '' a lot of colonies would have said no , and the resulting wars would have been far more costly both in terms of pounds spent and lives lost . 
  not to mention a lot less effective , in terms of ending slavery as fast as possible . 
  i do n't see how an american civil war situation would be a better outcome for anyone . 
  not only that , but the fact that it was such a huge amount of money to ` buy the freedom ' of all the slaves is almost comforting . 
  it undermines the trendy revisionist fluff that moral arguments and abolitionism were irrelevant , and we only ended the slave trade because it somehow was beneficial to us economically . 
  imagine an mp today coming up with a plan to boost the economy that begins `` ok , let 's spend 40 % of the nations budget to get rid of something that we earned billions from in the last few decades '' . 
  nobody would agree with that . 
  related , to be willing to spend so much of the nations resources on such a thing - well , does n't that prove how important an issue it was ? 
  the basis of gangster films around the world . 
  all good points , but we never really abolished it in mainland britain because it was never really legal [ or illegal ] here ; there 's a good summary of the important cases and precedents set [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_at_common_law ) . 
  there 's a famous , beautiful and possibly apocryphal line from one of the earliest cases in 1569 , where a guy was witnessed beating a slave he bought in russia . 
  the court ordered the slave to be freed because '' * the air of england is too pure for any slave to breathe * '', 
   also one mild edit , we were neither the driving force that started the atlantic slave trade nor the first major power to abolish slavery in our empire . 
  both of those go to the portuguese . 
  i 'd question whether the portuguese can get credit for the latter . 
  it seems they were more concerned with banning non-african slaves . 
  although slavery was outlawed in their indian colonies and madeira earlier , and the holding of chinese slaves was also banned ... 
  they were happy to allow the trade in slaves to continue , and slavery still existed in angola , mozambique and brazil . 
  from the wiki page on portuguese slavery  the transatlantic slave trade was definitely outlawed altogether by portugal in 1836 , at the same time as other european powers , as a result of british pressure . 
  slavery within the african portuguese colonies , however , would only be definitely abolished in 1869 , following a treaty between united states and britain for the suppression of the slave trade . 
  in brazil , which had become independent from portugal in 1822 , slavery was finally abolished in 1888 . 
  it would be nice if any portuguese folks have any perspective on this though . 
  regardless , my major point of pride was n't about being the first to pass some decree ... any country can do that , and lots did , but i do n't think anyone else tried as hard to end it as britain . 
  the only other time i can think of that even comes close , is when the us fought a war to end slavery . 
  but that was against themselves so they only get half marks . 
  i am most proud of the time we acted against our economic interests to be the first major world power to ban the trade in slaves , in 1807 . 
  not only did we ban it in for our ourselves , but we used our influence to get lots of other countries to sign treaties also banning it , and used our military and [ naval power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_africa_squadron ) to enforce the ban . 
  the uk was the driving force that ended the atlantic slave trade * . 
  \\* we were probably the driving force that started the atlantic slave trade too , but let 's leave that for the `` least proud moment '' thread, 
  winner was http://www.cellocheese.com/product/artisan-parmesan/ , click ingredients . 
  enjoy your sawdust, 
  imitation versions with pasteurized milk . 
  looks similar , tastes worse . 
   brie , camembert this is less surprising , most decent soft french cheeses are illegal in the land of the free . 
  they have really strict regulations about importing unpasteurized milk products ... 
  i 'd argue the opposite . 
  dop rules and similar preserve diversity , and prevent manufacturers and retailers from sacrificing flavour for other desirable commercial aspects ( shelf life , low cost etc. ) . 
  how many cheeses are us original developments , and how many are just aping european traditional styles ? 
  without them we 'd have fewer cheeses and fewer flavours ... look at the crap varieties of fruits and vegetables now available in a supermarket . 
  they 're blander , mostly same half a dozen available everywhere , but hey they look good and last for ages . 
  even if you made it in the right place , this would be nowhere close to being allowed to call itself parmesan . 
  ingredients in the winning entry : pasteurized milk , cheese cultures , sea salt , enzymes [ * prob fpc rennet * ] , natamycin and cellulose [ * wood pulp * ] ingredients in actual parmesan per dop rules : raw milk , salt and [ animal ] rennet . 
  not for free - but there should be a way for other eu residents to buy a tv license and stream/catchup uk tv . 
   aimed at brits really stupid brits who go on holiday to poland with a bunch of euros?actually , wait , that sounds like something that happens, 
  i pay for amazon prime in the uk , and took a firestick out to france recently to avoid shitty french dubbed tv . 
  i thought at least i 'd be able to watch the digital things on amazon i 'd bought previously ... 
  but no . 
  nothing works , just some lame message about not being in a supported country , and it does n't even have the option to use a vpn . 
  blocking users from bumfuckistan is one thing , but within the eu we should be all treated equally and given access to everything . 
  i though this was the single market thing we all signed up to . 
  lies !, 
  there 's also a service between nantes-saumur - [ tours blois orleans ] - austerlitz that runs 4 times a week , and a similar one that runs bordeaux-austerlitz . 
  not great frequency or speed but it 's stupidly cheap and the seats are sooo comfy,

  rubbish , they are lying . 
  everyone knows that islam has nothing to do with the brussels attacks \\ #terrorhasnoreligion, 
  they have n't killed anyone in a long while [ if ever ] i do n't think , it 's mostly small-scale assaults/vandalism/sabotage / bombings that rarely make international news . 
  some of them tried to take credit for [ downing a helicopter ] ( http://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2014/01/letter-claims-bordeaux-crash-not-an-accident/ ) a couple of years ago but that was probably just opportunism . 
  it 's better than it was though - in the 70s they seriously entertained an [ offer from gaddafi 's libya ] ( http://www.timatkin.com/articles?1052#.vtn6kjylsuk ) for weapons/funding/training in guerilla warfare . 
  wine is * serious business * in france . 
  this . 
  [ cav ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comit%c3%a9_r%c3%a9gional_d%27action_viticole ) ( french wine terrorist group ) do n't fuck around , and they are still active with bombings and such . 
  definitely not wrong . 
  there 's a reason every abrahamic holy book praises wine and rewards the faithful with wine ( yes , even the quran has rivers of delicious wine in heaven ) . 
  never enjoying a good glass of wine or scotch is as sad as never seeing the beauty in a painting , never being moved by a piece of music , never feeling the embrace of a lover ... lifelong teetotallers are lying to themselves and others , they are missing out on one of life 's great experiences, 
   welfare abuse ? 
    they call in-work benefits * welfare abuse * ?!, 
  i 'm sorry , but when did tax credits for poorer employees count as welfare abuse ? 
  what else would you call it when roma get a ` job ' selling the big issue and then claim [ tax credits ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jun/05/the-big-issue-iain-duncan-smith ) and [ housing benefit ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/17/big-issue-seller-wins-right-housing-benefit ) , child benefit etc. 
  off the back of that ?

  because russia are flying regular combat missions in syria , including along turkey 's southern border ?
