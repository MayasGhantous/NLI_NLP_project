  and whilst the conflict may be contained in syria , turkey has done a very poor job of securing it 's border . 
  plenty of supplies flowing over there to groups like isis . 
  and also there was not really a chance for ` crucial surveillance ' , [ the area they flew over ] ( https://i.imgur.com/sfecnz0.png ) is totally insignificant . 
  more relevant would be turkey 's violations into armenian airspace ( [ example from october \\ ) ] ( http://tass.ru/en/world/827804 ) . 
  in armenia , the russian armed forces help to protect the airspace ... 
  i 'm sure their tolerance will be at all-time low in the next few weeks . 
  e : resubmitted , automoderator did n't like the news site included last time, 
   federica mogherini , the eu 's chief diplomat , says that all the attackers are so far believed to be eu citizens . 
  she speaks after a meeting of eu foreign ministers . 
   `` let me underline , the profile of the terrorists so far identified tells us this is an internal threat , '' said the high representative . 
  ** she notes the external eu border is an issue regarding returning jihadis ** . 
  but she adds : `` it is all eu citizens so far . 
  this can change with the hours , but so far it is quite clear it is an issue of internal domestic security . '', 
  bolded the bit that thinkprogress omitted e : http://europa.eu/!cw68jy original source , press conference at about 3am monday morning . 
  it turns out that it did change with the hours . 
  from a news report today in the telegraph  ` ahmad al mohammad ' - died in suicide bomb at stade de france  the real name of the suicide bomber apparently carrying a fake syrian passport when he detonated at the stade de france remains a mystery , but officials say he entered europe as an asylum seeker less than two months earlier . 
  eu talking head makes claim that is somehow not reported anywhere but extremely partisan us blogs ? 
  that she does n't even seem to repeat anywhere on her [ twitter ] ( http://www.twitter.com/federicamog ) ? 
  a + for effort tho, 
  your link says  at least one of the terrorists behind the deaths of 129 people in paris sneaked into france posing as a syrian refugee , it has been claimed . 
    serbian media last night reported french authorities had found a passport belonging to syrian ahmed almuhamed at the scene of the attack at the stade de france . 
    according to the newspaper , blic , the 25-year-old had arrived on the greek island of leros on october 3 on his way to paris . 
  / r/conspiracy is that way - , 
  i. . . do n't really get what point you are trying to make . 
  you were wrong . 
  the ` old ' ( actually a month ago ) reddit threads make grim reading . 
  [ some eastern europeans were chanting `` today refugees , tomorrow terrorists '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3m1cos/today_refugees_tomorrow_terrorists_eastern/ ) and are smugly dismissed in the press and comments as narrow-minded xenophobes . 
   sigh . 
   you can most certainly disagree with the current handling of the refugee crisis , but equating every refugee with a terrorist wo n't make anybody look at your point kindly . 
   most muslims even in countries with strong streaks of radical islamism mostly want to improve their own lives . 
  this is even more applicable to syrians ( who had a more secular streak than most ) and especially those going into the west . 
  will there be radicals among them ? 
  sure . 
  will it be many ? 
  how many ? 
  nobody knows , but it 'll be less than you have ordinary murderers in your own population ( if you run the numbers that is kind of obvious as the incoming is n't that large a percentage of the european population ) . 
  + / u/brainonloan , still stand by this ? 
  i mean you 're technically correct , numerically there are probably still fewer than ordinary murderers ... 
  impossible !, 
  the [ danish intelligence told us ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/09/22/uk-europe-migrants-denmark-idukkcn0rm1mw20150922 ) it would n't happen . 
  ( topics [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3m1hix/danish_intelligence_militants_not_seen_using/ ) and [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lyfai/danish_secret_service_no_terrorists_among/ ) ) + / u/theapatheist, 
  maybe you could wait for the blood of the actual victims to dry before hand wringing for those poor hypothetical muslims sometime in the future . 
   you ca n't shout `` fire '' in e.g. 
  theatre when there is non and expect to get no punishment/fine/whatever because of the first amendment . 
  fun fact : `` you ca n't shout fire in a movie theatre '' was a metaphor [ first used ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schenck_v._united_states ) by the supreme court to justify imprisoning people who distributed pacifist , anti-draft literature in wwi . 
  the first amendment is neither as far-reaching nor as powerful as most americans imagine it to be . 
  love this poem , we were taught it at school . 
  pretty sure that latin teacher is now on a register ... 
  i still remember the translation he gave for the first line too , a very quaint `` i will have my way with you both upstairs and downstairs '', 
  the composite names do suck a bit , way too longwinded . 
  how about shortening auvergne-rh\u00f4ne-alpes to ` aurhal ' ? 
  you seem to be intolerant of gluten, 
   last year , just 790 iraqis applied for asylum in finland and only 123 were approved . 
  about 350 were rejected with more than 100 deported to iraq and the remainder returned to other eu countries where they first arrived . 
  some were given temporary permits to stay on compassionate grounds , taking into account factors like age , illness or pregnancy . 
  so that makes ... 317 given ` temporary permits ' to stay ? 
  yep , i 'm sure they 'll all deported when their colds clear up . 
  in the uk you can generally take up to 7 days off without a doctors note . 
  also the government is n't trying to get sick people to avoid the doctors , just to make better choices about where to go - e.g. 
  call the nhs helpline or see a pharmacist first ... 
  keep this quiet , but the royal family are n't british . 
  once again the italians ensure they 'll be on the losing side , by desperately pledging fealty to a doomed alliance ... 
  german steps in and bails out the greek , such a surprise, 
  of course . 
  charity and international aid to the needy is a cornerstone of british public policy , we 're a very altruistic society and long may that continue . 
  only the [ united states gives more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_development_aid_country_donors ) . 
  i 'd be totally happy for the uk to continue to provide development aid to countries that need it , like greece . 
  it 's only fair . 
   why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother 's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye ? 
  do i need to spell it out ? 
  folks in quasi-third-world nations doom-mongering on our behalf is ridiculous . 
  if the economic outlook in the uk was ever half as bleak as greece is now , brexit would be a tremendous failure . 
  the eu may be the only reason you 're not eating flour from a un food aid program now , but britain has n't benefited as much from the union and we 'll do fine outside it . 
  the wonders of r/europe . 
  getting lectured on economic strength and prosperity by greek and portuguese flags . 
  we take a census every 10 years . 
  that 's enough ... 
  it 's creepy having a huge database that any local government employee and his dog can look at . 
  i 'm mean i 'm sure there exists such a database , but it 's only for mi5 and the rest of the spooks . 
  not even police . 
  wow that sounds awful . 
  is there any way not to cancel the net neutrality guidelines , but just maybe to delay them for a year or two ? 
  asking for a friend . 
  are you still going at it ? 
  look mate , i would try and say something rude about your country but i literally do n't know where limburg is and do n't care to find out . 
  i 'm betting it 's somewhere shit though , and that 's why you 're so bitter . 
  fuck off not in for any rude awakening . 
  i just hope the uk is treated like any other country not in the eu, 
  i did plenty of research , fuckwit . 
  i decided it would be better to vote leave . 
  i am not confident about the future - nobody can be sure of that - but i sure as hell do n't regret my vote . 
  stay salty xxx, 
  i voted leave and i am totally happy with my decision . 
  please unleash your salty , impotent rage on me . 
  shock ! = regret, 
  if anyone had a reliable way to predict this they would be on a yacht in the med , not on reddit . 
  it might go up . 
  or down . 
  or maybe stay about the same . 
  pretty sure the guy who posted this on twitter wrote this .
