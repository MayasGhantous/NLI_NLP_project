  ca n't sd , greens and the left just pass it themselves since they have a majority in parliament ? 
  everyone is missing something really obvious . 
  almost half of jordanians are descended from dispossessed palestinians . 
  so guess why they do n't like the west . 
  did you just make up these numbers ? 
  personally i would prefer that everyone gives up their religion * ( insert le euphoric meme here ) * but if they just became like the jews and assimilated into society while keeping their religion then that would be enough . 
  actually the majority of europe 's muslims live in the east . 
  and more than half outside the eu . 
  which is why i find this statistic to be fairly unclear tbh , it does n't define the borders of europe . 
  there will obviously be a big increase in the muslim population , but this figure may well be including the population growth of places that have always been muslim . 
  i 'm talking about european turkey ( mostly istanbul - which is a huge and growing city ) , albania , bosnia and south/central russia . 
  population growth in these places is kind of a non-story . 
  numbers for western europe only would give a better picture of how our society is changing . 
  well they basically stopped us having a parliament for 45 years despite majority support for home rule during most of that period and a ( very slight ) majority voting for such in a referendum . 
  i 'm not so confident . 
  if there was a totally overwhelming desire for independence like in those countries then probably yes . 
  keeping the union together would be impossible and the uk is smart enough to see that . 
  if there is some doubt as to what direction scotland wants to go i believe they try their hardest to stop the breakup of the union by avoiding a referendum and disrupting the scottish government 's efforts to hold one - as is happening in catalonia . 
  i always find it weird how aggressive / r/europe is towards catalan nationalists compared to scottish nationalists . 
   why should 10 % of the population have as much representation as the other 90 % because 600 years ago some people somewhere had a country um . . ? 
  * who * is suggesting that ? 
  the only reason the last referendum was allowed to happen is because westminster knew it would n't pass . 
  the entire point in their eyes was to crush the snp . 
  that 's why they shut down the debate on a third option for more powers . 
  but the referendum was a lot closer than expected and instead forced westminster to concede more powers * and * buoyed the snp massively . 
  funny how things work out . 
  i do n't think westminster would allow another referendum within this decade . 
  the scottish government would only call one if they knew they were going to win . 
  i literally do not understand how the us could spend 6 billion dollars on an election . 
  the `` tories '' aka conservative party but we never call them that . 
  in the 80s thatcher presided over a period of de-industrialisation and de-socialisation which was highly traumatic for most of scottish society . 
  all the while they were pumping billions from the north sea , the profits from which we mostly never saw . 
  the perceived injustice was strengthened by the fact that scotland never voted for the conservatives so their policies were seen as being imposed upon us by the english . 
  the result was that anti-conservatism then became deeply ingrained into our national narrative in a kind of reverse-poland . 
  today left wing parties hold almost 90 % of the seats in the scottish parliament and the conservatives sit alone , relegated to the status of pariah . 
  the main left-wing parties score political points by assaulting them at every opportunity and tory bashing constitutes 90 % of scottish political rhetoric : * labour 's main campaigning point is that only they can stop the tories , while the nationalists justify independence with `` no more tory governments '' . 
  * they attempt to discredit one another by calling them `` tartan tories '' or `` red tories '' or claiming they are in league with the tories . 
  * scottish tabloids bash the conservatives relentlessly the way british papers bash immigrants . 
  * in scotland if a politician does n't like something he simply hammers the point by prefixing the word tory . 
  tory-austerity , tory-westminster , the tory-south etc. 
  * the price of touching the conservative party is annihilation . 
  the scottish liberal democrats were once the third force of scottish politics but were basically wiped out because the uk-wide party made david cameron prime minister . 
  the tories are largely the justification for the independence movement . 
  it is aggravating to scottish people that we have to deal with tory governments we do n't want , and the weakness of the right in scotland is the main reason our politics have taken a completely different path . 
  the gulf * has * had social progress though . 
  in fact it has probably undergone one of the most rapid transformations of any society in history . 
  in one generation they went from milling around the desert in small nomadic tribes to abu dhabi and dubai . 
  the gulf may still be extremely backwards by our standards but a culture can only change so fast . 
  i do n't think we are that similar with those countries . 
  the divide between democracies and non-democracies is smaller than the divide between the rich world and the poor world . 
  i agree we should be improving relations with all those countries though . 
  especially india . 
  india will emerge as a powerful country this century and we have a similar political culture and tonnes of common interests regarding china and terrorism especially . 
  yet for some reason we have supported pakistan against them . 
  the jews are behind everything . 
  ** everything **, 
  wtf i thought that was the tabletop design . 
  i did n't understand the image until i saw your comment . 
  the huge proportion of converts is extremely interesting . 
  nobody is really paying attention to this in the uk . 
  it 's not even on the bbc 's top articles . 
  it 's just a reaction to argentina buying planes from russia . 
  i 'm not sure how both of you managed to swallow this 180 billion pounds `` for scotland '' figure without realising that would bring public spending in scotland to # 36,000 per head . 
  i see why people are suspicious of a party that represents scotland solely , but england frankly has little to fear from the snp . 
  i suspect a lot of people in england would actually support the snp if they knew anything about it . 
  it 's the only large party that stands on an anti-austerity platform . 
  however the tories have clearly managed to create a hysteria down south about the big bad scotnats with their talk about the thames frothing with blood and their posters of snp politicians who are n't even in charge anymore . 
  it is disgraceful to see the tories deliberately increasing tensions within the union for the simple purpose of winning an election . 
  she wanted 180 billion pounds more in ** uk ** spending than labour currently plans . 
  she is against austerity , not trying to screw england . 
  the labour press in scotland and the conservative party add `` for scotland '' simply because it is coming from the snp which , it is assumed , exists for the sole purpose antagonising middle englanders . 
  180 billion is six times more than the entire budget for the scottish parliament . 
  i have no idea why this comment is tagged as `` controversial '' . 
  slavery is the practice of owning people as property . 
  we can call it slavery when swedish corporations start abducting people , forcing them to work their entire lives and can sell the children they have . 
  referring to one voluntary week on unpaid work as `` slavery '' is incredibly hyperbolic . 
  i would n't worry about that . 
  ukip 's foreign policy is essentially isolationist . 
  they 're not really assertive nationalists so much as super-conservatives who want to withdraw from the world and take britain back to the 1950s . 
  the price of snp support for labour will undoubtedly be increased devolution , which i hope will lessen the problem with evel . 
  the reason the snp votes on `` english issues '' is because the scottish government 's budget is set by a formula which takes into account english public spending . 
  thus if the british government cuts the nhs england then that affects the scottish budget . 
  they do n't vote on `` english english '' issues like say fracking or free schools . 
  partly because of principle but mostly because they are not interested in governing england . 
  it 's a blatantly retarded system that nobody on either side of the border is happy with . 
  the scottish parliament should control it 's own finances not rely on westminister handouts . 
  cameron 's plans for evel are not a true solution . 
  it will create massive resentment in scotland as it enables the tories to tear apart the scottish budget without our mps being able to do anything about it . 
  as a citizen of the uk , sinn fein scares me . 
  at least nigel farage did n't sit on the war council of a terrorist organisation and have north irish civillians executed . 
  ukip does n't care about islam so much - it 's not the pvv . 
  it 's main target is east europeans . 
  we could n't contain it ourselves . 
  or well , we could if we acted when the problem was small , but when it got to the point where tens of thousands of people were landing in greece each day it was impossible . 
  we are not logistically capable of detaining hundreds of thousands of people if we have no country to send them back to . 
  yeah but it 's irrelevant because turkey will never join the eu . 
  i find it laughable and ridiculous that the the leave campaign accuses remain of fearmongering and then comes out with this bs . 
  turkey has had high levels of economic growth throughout erdogan 's 13 year supremacy . 
  do n't see why it would change now . 
  i do n't really see how .
