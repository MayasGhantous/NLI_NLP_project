  people are not completely opposed to the idea of eurozone membership . 
  in fact we would probably be joining now if independent since from 2003 onwards pro-euro parties have held a majority in edinburgh . 
  it 's not exactly that simple . 
  money printed by scottish banks has a different ( usually worse ) exchange rate from that printed by english banks , to the endless annoyance of scottish tourists . 
  because of this scottish people visiting england will often have their money rejected . 
  bbc and the other news networks are actually very good at being impartial and informative . 
  the problem is the newspapers which are batshit insane with their biases . 
  i do n't know why people even read them or treat them as a reliable source of information . 
  to be fair , the benefit one is probably because some benefit claims can be legal - thus not fraudulent - but not deserved in the eyes of the public . 
  i live in one of the poorest parts of scotland and like 10 % of the population here has never had a job . 
  left school at 16 and claimed benefits ever since . 
  this and getting all the countries in this hypothetical alliance to join in every war . 
  what if russia decides to invade latvia and france decides it does n't want to help ? 
  if every country had some kind of super-proportional budget then that would sort out some things . 
  for example france has x % of the gdp and therefore has x % of the fighter jets , tanks etc. 
  then when france refuses to help the rest of the eu , we have x % less assets but no crippling gaps in our defence . 
  however i 'm sure there are some assets that ca n't be divided into 28 parts , so for this we would require full cooperation from all eu countries all the time . 
  i do n't really know enough about how the military works to judge on how feasible this system is . 
  it seems likely that important assets are already shared among nato members since we are all quite interdependent on each other . 
  someone else who knows more can come and comment on my ramblings and explain how a common defence budget might work in practice . 
  what i do know is that europeans will not accept being dragged into unpopular wars by foreign countries . 
  not yet . 
  it would tear the eu apart . 
  there is no need for the ec to control this army . 
  just want maximum cooperation is required . 
  the eu would probably need to have some oversight though since there needs to be some organisation overseeing the military spending of 28 countries . 
  to be honest i think we are already highly interdependent on one another in the realms of security , intelligence and defence so i do n't care that much . 
  individual eu countries can not protect themselves from external threats without external support . 
  not even the uk or france can do this very effectively . 
  what we would lose would be the ability to control our military budgets , since these would have to be agreed at the european level . 
  but imo this is preferable to raising it and diverting more money from social projects . 
  sweden and finland are so powerless such an alliance would be pointless . 
  it would n't be able to defend against anything . 
  pretty sure nato does not deal with internal conflicts . 
  let 's be honest though , no governments give a shit about international law . 
   without the us there would have been no wwii , and we would still be a empire . 
  are you for fucking real ? 
  that is a totally unreasonable position . 
  you should oppose the us when it is wrong and support it when it is right . 
  in this case the us is in the right . 
  ukraine does not deserve to be invaded and half its land annexed by russia just because it wanted closer ties with europe . 
  the fact that the us supports them does not change this principle . 
  sakartvelo sounds better imo : / georgia is a bit boring, 
  i do n't think paris , london or berlin ought to be capitals since they would hold much influence in the union already . 
   the far-right uses religion as basically a carrier surface for their messages , but the real message behind it always shines through this is quite important in europe which some people do n't understand . 
  in europe religious and national identity are frequently intertwined , so religious fanaticism and sectarian conflict are nearly always about nationalism eg though the north irish is drawn along religious lines , it 's clearly about nationalism . 
  most north irish people are only religious insofar as their irish and catholic or british and protestant identities are intertwined . 
  same for yugoslavia i think , and the 100 % greek-orthodox-ftw greek far right , the hardcore catholicism of the polish far right etc. 
  they still went to war over poland regardless of whether it was they who finally liberated poland or not . 
  i imagine it 's being spent on the eu offices there rather than the actual luxembourgish people . 
  luxembourg is different from belgium because it has a population 20x larger so it does not distort the figures so much . 
  belgium is still way higher than the other `` rich '' northwestern countries though . 
  well there is obviously both positive and negative effects so it just depends what your values are , ie what do you consider most important ? 
  ** positive effects : ** migrants fill in a lot of gaps in the labour market , eg the uk has a severe shortage of chefs , laborers and medical professionals so we import a lot of those from india and pakistan . 
  they offset population decline which stimulates the economy so that we can maintain a larger workforce compared to the number of elderly people taking out pensions and medical services . 
  other countries like japan have serious economic problems partly because of a declining and `` greying '' population . 
  with increased population we have increased demand for local services , boosting some employment sectors . 
  they lower labour costs in certain sectors because immigrants are generally willing to work for less . 
  this is great for the business people and the economy as a whole . 
  immigrants tend to be more likely to create businesses than local people . 
  ** negative effects : ** lower labour costs are great for business people but not for labourers . 
  while the middle and upper classes gain economically from migration ( because of a larger service market and reduced labour costs ) the working classes lose out . 
  some working class people may find themselves unemployed because they can not compete . 
  during an economic downturn there may be few jobs and people may not like losing their opportunity to a foreigner . 
  increased population results in increased pressure on public services like housing and schools . 
  personally i think this is mostly because of shit management by the people who provide those services but the effect is still real . 
  unskilled immigrants are generally more likely to commit crimes . 
  this is a pretty big one . 
  immigrants often send back a lot of money to their families at home resulting in a substantial cash outflow from their host country . 
  ** non-arguments : ** some people argue that the west is becoming `` islamised '' but this is n't something anyone should worry about for decades at least , it will take at the very , very least a century for even immigrant paradises like sweden to become muslim majority countries . 
  the eu as a whole will most likely never be muslim majority . 
  meanwhile immigrants are still not politically organised in any way and people who claim that institutional islamisation is occurring ( the imposition of sharia law etc ) are clearly mad . 
  immigrants also do not leech of the welfare systems . 
  usually , as a whole , they extract much less from the welfare system than native people even though they are generally poorer . 
  they generally work longer hours and are more productive than native people with the same skillset . 
  and there 's probably many other points that i forgot to mention . 
  this guy is just a troll account so do n't bother to engage him . 
  we should really just accept the fact that `` europe '' is not a continent that exists in geography so trying to give it geographic limits is silly . 
  but albania ia s muslim country not montenegro, 
    churches are tax exempt  for good reason , unliek you guys the americans do n't have kings queens and state churches . 
  i do n't really get how these are related . 
  also the portuguese do n't have a monarch like 85 % of europeans . 
   it 's slightly easier to find excuses for violence in the quran i really do n't think so . 
  i believe there is some story in the old testament in which god tells his followers to massacre the unbelievers in another city to the last man , woman and child , then kills them when they refuse . 
  the ancient jews also really liked stoning people apparently . 
  eg if a child disobeys his father too many times then he must be stoned by the townspeople . 
  people always talk about the quran says this and that and thus muslims are dangerous , but people are n't retarded and - although different cultures place different emphasis on scripture - there is no place in the christian or islamic world where people are blindly following their scripture word for word . 
  no way is ukip anything but a right-wing party . 
  they openly describe themselves as conservative and claim that the conservative party is n't conservative enough . 
  they deny climate change , oppose gay marriage , support greater cuts , greater private sector involvement in the nhs , abolition of inheritance tax , limits on immigration etc , all very right wing policies . 
  saudi arabia and its wahhabi clique do not represent all of islam . 
  what paranoid nonsense . 
  eurosceptic posts are regularly seen and upvoted here . 
  your statement idoes n't make a lot of sense anyway . 
  why would eurosceptic posts get upvoted and only comments be quashed by the `` downvote hammer '' . 
  i felt like all the candidates were seriously hampered by the presentation . 
  they did n't get enough time to answer the questions that were asked or really put forward their ideas . 
  i imagine the aftermath of the phone hacking scandal also reduced britain 's score a bit . 
  you 're completely missing his point . 
  he 's not arguing that scotland is closer to the nordics than england culturally , genetically or in any other way .
