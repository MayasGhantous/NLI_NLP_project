it 's a wonderful day for 2 million people * of * scotland , not 1.6 however . 
  poorer areas with people more likely to be struggling , out of work or requiring food banks . 
  fucking yes brother - a brill moment indeed, 
  i neither agree or disagree , i am not educated enough about the topic to give an opinion . 
  i know you probably only seen the mighty blue and white saltire but i am actually a different user from the guy who posted that claim . 
  ha i am retarded , sorry amigo !, 
  that 's what i get for staying up all night watching it i guess . 
  have you grown tired of human rights too ? 
  because those will be getting scrapped pronto as well . 
  is it not fair to say that geography is a political factor however ? 
  well , the snp 's ultimate aim is independence - that 's the reason the party exists . 
  if they hold another referendum and lost , it would kill the party for a lifetime . 
  so any immediate power is not worth it for that , or any chance at another vote just because , is not worth it . 
  remember if the exit poll is anything to go by and the tories do win another 5 years , it 's only going to help fan the flames of independence and keep the movement alive . 
  we need to see how this turns out to know what 's going to happen really . 
  the snp are the best party in this union at playing the long game , so they wo n't want another referendum until it 's absolutely certain there will be a yes victory . 
   do scottish people dislike the tories thattt much more than labour though ? 
  yes . 
  deep seated generational hatred so strong that the tories do n't even truly try to win seats in most of the constituencies here . 
  because some people in scotland feel british and would identify as being so , not scottish . 
  so they do n't think of independence that way because they already feel part of a nation . 
   it 's not english votes , scottish votes , it 's british votes deciding the future of britain . 
  aye mate in theory that might be correct , but in the 300 years we 've been in a union the majority of people in scotland and england still identify by their respective country and still see ourselves as countries and nations of people . 
  so in * reality * we do look at it as an english decision , the same way they see things we do as a scottish decision . 
  refugees not immigrants , immigrants would eventuall work and pay back into the system . 
  refugees are only there until syria is safe to return to . 
  we still would n't be independent yet so not very . 
  planning a trip to portugal at some point in the next couple years , wan na surf on your beaches and soak up your sun for a couple months . 
   because you seem pretty misinformed and judgemental when it comes to the english aye and you 've been a bastion of insider fact based knowledge on scotland and the scottish ** national ** party lmfao . 
  pot , meet kettle . 
   as for the economy , the uk as much as you wish it will fail will face difficulties short term but long term will prosper . 
  funnily enough that is ** exactly ** how i see scotlands future out of the uk . 
  thank fuck you are on here then as the holy preacher and arbiter of wisdom to correct these silly euros and put them back on the glorious path of what is truly good for the uk and scotland . 
  i 'm sure you have a lifetime of experience in this subject when you speak with such certainty that i 'll believe you . 
  wait no i wo n't because you do n't . 
  how about i want us to leave the uk and then try and make us a fully functional country on our own terms ? 
  nah you 're right mate , instead we should trust in the uk and the same institution that allowed ravenscraig to turn into a desolate shithole , the same institution that allowed the north of england to turn into a desolate shithole - the same institution that will allow aberdeen to turn into a desolate shithole when the oil dries up . 
  how about instead of an economic one it 's one of self determination and identity ? 
  how about to me , my family and my friends , that in neither this life or a hundred others we have never once identified with the idea of being british or being represented by the british government ? 
  instead being in a union where the big decisions are made by people we have absolutely no common ground with or feel we relate to ? 
  hence the referendum result or the general election result . 
  how about instead of being in a union that told me to conform to it 's identity and speak the queens english instead of aye because we were n't correct . 
  how about instead of being led by a corrupt basket case of a institution that lies to my nation anytime it sees fit we aim for something a little better ? 
  here 's the best one - how about we vote yes to get away from poisonous attitudes like yours ? 
  zoom along now . 
   do n't understand why scottish nats get the love they do on this / r / ...  the snps plan for independence was full of lies and falsehoods , just like the brexit one but even worse . 
  because you 're an absolute zoomer . 
  i am in my 20 's and from your traditional labour voting family , my mums and dads , their mums and dads and so on all the way back . 
  anyway it was only when i turned 18 when talk of indyref happened that i started to switch on to politics around me . 
  in the decade of cameron , brown and blair that have been representing me , i have never once felt like they had my back or my interests in mind . 
  however that never bothered me because i was n't accustomed to anything else . 
  it 's only been through indyref , and through this eu referendum where for the first time in my life i have honestly felt like nicola and the snp actually are looking out for me . 
  i do n't share all the same views the snp do , some stuff i do n't like , but i do feel like no matter what when you go to westminster or nicola goes to brussels , i have someone in my corner who actually is thinking of and looking out * for me , my family and my friends * . 
  and that feeling is actually quality . 
  not really a question just something i 'd like to share you way , if i had a question or two i guess it would be : in light of recent events in nice , the attacks in paris and all over europe as well as the discussion of multiculturalism and diversity - what steps should be taken to ensure integration of others into scotland ? 
  she did do some of that but it 's also due to the fact tory-lite collapsed as well and they got a share of those votes instead . 
  and that 's absolutely fine my man , but you can see where we both differ and why that might change our political outlook !, 
  how do the rest of you europeans feel about the fact scotland and northern ireland voted in favour of staying ? 
  does it give you hope ? 
  do you not care ? 
  would you want to help us try and remain ? 
  do we deserve to sink with england and wales regardless ? 
  just your thoughts on that particular aspect of the result in general i guess . 
  but you are assuming people share in that british identity , personally myself , my family and all my friends have never and will never identify ourselves as british or share those british values . 
  it 's scottish  european  earthling . 
  england could have swung it if it just did n't vote leave - we gave more remains than leave to the vote end of story . 
   it seems likely that her lukewarm support of remain was a ploy to get another independence referendum . 
  you mean every party in scotland 's support of remain since they were all in agreeance on what we should vote ? 
  hard to get the people energised when there was n't even a debate to be had between the parties themselves . 
  how exactly did her ` lukewarm support ' ensure she would get another referendum ? 
  she would had to of seen to it that all of scotland voted remain to make sure that she had this smoking gun to use , how does not supporting the campaign ensure she got that result ? 
  it 's actually on the rise due to renewed investment and interest , first time in a long time there will be a lot more younger speakers thanks to the new g\u00e0idhlig schools . 
  are you trying to convince yourself or me ? 
  because you can say all you like this was expected and no one should be surprised but the facts are the facts , and the facts are that a lot of no voters woke up today feeling swindled by the english people and ready to change their votes . 
   nobody can possibly argue this ref was a surprise to them or a backstabbing , it was well known to be coming . 
  http://i.imgur.com/kcsk34q.png final constituency of scotland is in , entire country came out remain ahead . 
  because in the referendum campaign for our independence we were sold the idea that by remaining a part of the uk we were guaranteed the best of both worlds , by being stronger in the uk with more devolved power and still being a guaranteed member of the eu . 
  there was a lot of talk about a new scotland not getting into the eu or being denied or taking a long time and coming with a lot of strings etc. 
  yeah he means to rejoin the crown . 
  i 'm not justifying it mate , i am just telling you why it is the way it is . 
  and you can argue against it all you want , but it ** is * the reality , and it is showing in this referendum . 
  the working class has acted , and done so in their vote - that 's what we are seeing in these results , i am just telling you the facts . 
  not inside two it wo n't , back to back referendums has everyone fed up of them - there 's no appetite for another one all over again , people need a breather . 
  except they moved the payrolls around the books to much it was hard to tell and keep out the loop , and because furthermore if you did report them then those companies pulled all the work from the locals entirely and punished them for it - hence why you see all these countryside places voting leave . 
  sure it was a problem of government institution , but to john smith he only see 's what happens in his daily life - and in his daily life european migrants undercut his job , undercut his livelihood and reaped all the benefits and his old boss got richer as well . 
  so everyone else got better off from being in the eu while he saw none of the pros . 
  that 's why there 's a chance of another independence referendum if we do leave , because we were told we had all the benefits of the union and the eu . 
  and if we do have another one , then europe will be open to negotiate to us because the uk will no longer be a member , meaning they might actually support us in the campaign next time around . 
  it 's not about the numbers , it 's about the cheaper labour decreasing wages . 
  i first hand have witnessed it on farms where the local labour was replaced by poles who would work 15 hour shifts for # 4 an hour . 
  it was totally illegal and yet nothing was able to be done about it . 
  east renfrewshire 74 % remain . 
  cities demand things now ? 
  lol you might want to wait until the final numbers are in before trying to claim glasgow cost the vote . 
  glasgow never really shows up to vote , some of the poorest and most disenfranchised folk in the uk . 
  lol get a grip mate do n't be so stupid . 
  56 % turnout for glasgow . 
  fuckin have our back this then and we might get it !, 
  good lord man , are you forgetting scotlands national shame ? 
  the egg incident lives on and shall echo through eternity as the true horrors that nationalism brings .
