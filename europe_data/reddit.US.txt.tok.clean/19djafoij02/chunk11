  i ** love ** how the king 's current house is more modest than that of many financially successful dutch people . 
  thanks . 
  i thought it was a bit high .

  the islands in general are more interesting than the glorified low germans in jutland . 
  [ the stuff in red is all originally low germans , dutch , and frisians ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/germanic_dialects_ca._ad_1.png ) . 
   they use seaweed for the roofs that 's pretty viking . 
  laeso seems like the most stereotypically `` scandinavian '' looking part of dk . 
  anywhere else with a unique look ? 
  for my next trip to your fair kingdom . 
  i 've also seen some more exotic houses on some of the islands : [ l\u00e6s\u00f8 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/l%c3%a6s%c3%b8_house.jpg/220px-l%c3%a6s%c3%b8_house.jpg ) [ fan\u00f8 ] ( https://www.feriefanoe.dk/grafik/reel_1.jpg ) and southern houses often look almost english : http://moegeltoender.infoland.dk/wp-content/uploads/mg_9289-s%c3%b8nderby.jpg is that accurate ?

  there 's something so satisfying about a city that has [ both kinds of skyline ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/m%c3%bcnchen_-_westend.jpg ) . 
  it 's more low-rise , but [ hafencity in hamburg ] ( http://www.hafencity.com/upload/images/artikel/z_artikel_en_25_3_sommer_2007_1200x800.jpg ) has always appealed to me .

   i was being paid $ 385 a month ( the french statutory minimum for internships ) and i could still ( barely ) afford to live down there . 
  it was n't a huge amount of fun on that much money but at least the city was nice . 
  ahem . 
  if they could get another country 's military to help round them up and negotiate a deal with the eu , then maybe . 
  of course , the guy you 're replying to identifies as german . 
  germany has the right to occupy its own soil , amirite ? 
  non-european , but i have a real estate background . 
  yes , as / u/lgf92 said , there are some ordinary people living in monaco as they happen to have inherited citizenship and/or property . 
  however , monaco is essentially a couple of neighborhoods in a large french city that due to a historical quirk are their own country , and lots of people live in the surrounding neighborhoods and commute in . 
  it 's about a half hour by car or mass transit from monaco to nice , which is n't that different than commuting times in many other european cities and towns . 
  imagine that your city 's most affluent suburb got its independence , and then you get an idea of what monaco 's like . 
   commuted in this is the whole thing . 
  monaco is tiny and most low-to-middle-wage workers can commute in from the surrounding areas in france . 
  i can see why . 
  it 's a pretty nice place to live . 
   yippy little dogs how we bred the majestic european wolf into those spoiled little princesses is really the 8th wonder of the world . 
  so davos , chamonix , etc do n't owe their prestige to the skiing ? 
  i 'm actually playing around in / r/worldbuilding and was wondering how much traction a radically anti-american/anti-trump left wing group could get in europe . 
  seems they 'd be fringe and mainly cannibalizing radical muslim communities . 
  you do n't even say that when you know there 's no americans for km around ? 
   wubble joke or autocorrect ? 
   kitzb\u00fchel even if they do n't ski , the association of ski resorts with rich people and quaint mountain villages is strong as anywhere else . 
  skiers are known for their good taste . 
  wrong user i think . 
  i might have posted about this topic once . 
  so you do n't have any problems with native greek speakers identifying as macedonians ? 
   party leader is from aegean macedonia  gruevski 's paternal grandparents stem from the ottoman macedonia village of krushoradi , where his grandfather nikola grouios ( 1911 -- 1940 ) was born . 
  until the official greek annexation after the second balkan war in 1913 , it was under the jurisdiction of the bulgarian exarchate . 
  [ 8 ] the greek administration later led assimilative anti-bulgarian campaign , changing the names of the local villagers to the corresponding greek names . 
  [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] the village itself was renamed by the greek authorities to achlada in 1926 . 
  [ 12 ] [ 13 ] gruevski 's grandfather fought in the greco-italian war , where he lost his life . 
  [ 2 ] his name is mentioned on the war memorial in achlada among the names of the locals who were killed during world war ii . 
  years later , during the greek civil war , gruevski 's grandmother and father , fled north to what was then yugoslav macedonia , [ 2 ] where they changed their family name to gruevski in order to gain citizenship through assimilation , as was the yugoslav policy at the time . 
  [ 14 ] that is a royal mess ... is he greek-macedonian , bulgarian , or macedonian-macedonian ? 
  ironic that he 's such a nationalist when his dad adopted a slavic name instead of a greek one ; in an alternate universe he 's a greek macedonian named grouios . 
  is he ever accused of being a `` fake macedonian '' ? 
  i 've always found that line of argument ridiculous . 
  so hitler is somehow good because he only killed hundreds of thousands of innocent jews , not millions ? 
  above a few hundred dead , the intentions are more important than the death toll in determining genocide . 
  hence , srebrenica is generally considered one while debate rages on about stalin , who killed far more . 
  i got the answers i needed so i ai n't complaining . 
  ok thanks . 
  thanks then . 
  to me it sounds like he 's calling for deportations , but i do n't speak dutch so who am i to judge ? 
  so how did wilders get convicted ? 
  1 ) , a translation of his remarks , seems to be the most innocuous of the six . 
  you made me chuckle . 
  here , have an upvote . 
  only 1 ) is a quote from wilders . 
  the rest are from my imagination .

  nothing spanish ?

  one english , one spanish or portuguese , one arabic . 
  do n't worry . 
  you 'll still sound like a swede . 
  yeah , we sublet too . 
  sublet also survives in most forms of american english . 
  and becoming denmark 's bitch twice : first the jutes , then the danelaw . 
  yeah , fucking * denmark * pwned you . 
  or worse . 
   the right honourable the lord mayor of london that 's four titles in one person . 
  in 2015-2016 , it was held by jeffrey richard de corban evans , 4th baron mountevans , jp . 
  six titles . 
  that website is a mouthful of english . 
  i know you nordic and baltic types are good with that , though . 
  kivioli is apparently a russian-heavy town , and from what little i know of estonian ethno-linguistic politics russians are the `` gypsy '' equivalent in the baltics ( poor , do n't assimilate , live in ghettos , stereotypically commit crimes ) . 
  i can see why you emphasized the electronic metal doors to muffle the noise from the motocross festivals .

  is brittani\u00eb ever used ( similar to britain , which is the most common term in the us in my experience ) ?
