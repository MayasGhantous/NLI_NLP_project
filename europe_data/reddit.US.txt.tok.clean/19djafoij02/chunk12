   holland you normally use nizozemska ? 
   holland : very , i 'd say it 's the default term people go to in spoken language . 
  i suspect many do n't even know it 's not the correct one . 
  there are football chants where that 's the word used and everything . 
   in my experience , it 's mainly pedantic english-speakers who complain about it . 
  even the dutch do n't give a dam ( n ) . 
  catalan or andorran ? 
  ( no flair ), 
  in austria , a relatively flawless establishment candidate barely beat a right-wing populist little better than trump ( less extreme , but also less entertaining ) . 
  one of them has a sane , pro-science , stable leadership even if there 's room for improvement in certain human rights areas . 
  the other elected a president and congress who have vowed to go back on numerous international agreements even if they threaten civilization , and has a cabinet that sees much of the world as a threat . 
  it 's the same predicament in the middle east : stability vs democracy . 
  are there not european values though ? 
  and does europe not have the right to move away from allies that behave in an untrustworthy way ? 
  look at trump 's cabinet picks !, 
  i 'm not calling for sanctions , but i do believe europe needs to declare its independence to be taken seriously . 
  the us elections are only borderline democratic , and probably would n't be up to eu standards with the level of suppression that some states engage in . 
  at this point i 'd treat trump no differently than the president of russia , china , or any other country ... alliances should be a result of good behavior and cooperation , not something that forces them unless the us , say , commits genocide . 
  i 'd hope most true europeans agree with me . 
  would you like your country to move closer to china and away from the us ? 
  until europe unites , you have to choose between deeply flawed great powers , and while china has democracy and human rights issues it at least seems to be on the right side of science , technology , infrastructure , and trade . 
  i 'd probably pick china over the us for the time being . 
  no flair . 
  it seems from your history like you 're faroese . 
  there are outright neo-nazis in parliament in hungary and slovakia , so yeah . 
  you do n't even have to leave europe to see those kinds of contrasts . 
  ask how a dutch person vs. a russian will view stalin , or compare a polish view of wwii vs. a western ukrainian view vs. an eastern ukrainian view . 
  if you take away anything good about traditional roma gypsy culture and replace it with mafia and american ghetto wannabes , you get modern eastern european roma ghettos . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/11/article-2521868-1a0236ea00000578-392_634x683.jpg ) not [ this ] ( http://c8.alamy.com/comp/ermey1/appleby-in-westmorland-uk-4th-june-2015-gypsies-with-traditional-bow-ermey1.jpg ) , right ? 
   \u021bigari cigarettes ? 
  how is a major european city so affordable ? 
  in the us actually , the cheapest houses ( excluding auctions and obvious typos ) [ are generally in the ` hoods of detroit , baltimore , milwaukee , and cleveland ] ( http://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/fsba,fsbo,new,cmsn_lt/2-_beds/1-5000_price/0-19_mp/49.922935,-65.170898,-3.645,-125.81543_rect/3_zm/0_mmm/ ) , although maybe homes in moribund rural areas are n't even listed . 
  what 's wrong with port glasgow ? 
  it 's only a half-hour away from glasgow and it 's on the water . 
  if the britons believe that , it 's absolutely their right . 
  i mean , i 'd be concerned about his attitude towards climate change , his investments in scotland , and other issues that directly affect blighty , but i 'm not british so who am i to speak for you ? 
  that 's your prerogative to do what 's best for the brits . 
  not my decision to make, 
  with more than 500 treaties already broken , the government can do whatever it wants , it seems ... - http://m.dailykos.com/story/2014/11/21/1345986/-with-more-than-500-treaties-already-broken-the-government-can-do-whatever-it-wants-it-seems while there are definitely debates on how much to give the indigenous people , no other settler country has a major party that 's so deaf to those who came before them . 
  canada , australia , and nz have tried much more to reconcile with their predecessors , and latin america has generally assimilated them . 
  in the us , our cops shoot them for misdemeanors to an extent greater than for any o other race . 
  it 's a country of dubious legitimacy . 
  with how they 've treated the native americans i think we should recognize it as their land . 
  any one of those can happen , but all three means trump ascends to the white house with an asterisk by his name . 
  meaning he should be held on a shorter leash than say a reagan . 
  under us law , it 's illegal for the fbi director to interfere in elections but there 's no penalty that will deter a true political believer . 
  he should be in jail . 
  because of some very controversial behavior by the fbi . 
  in anywhere else there likely would 've been a redo election . 
  in most eu countries i 'd believe that a redo would be held . 
  see austria , where a much smaller good-faith mistake resulted in it a redo and a printing glitch in absentee ballots resulted in a delay . 
  you can argue that he only `` won '' bc of the fbi throwing the election . 
  what % of britons do you think would support not recognizing him as president if he pushes on his anti-climate policies ? 
  would any support downgrading relations with the us in favor of , say china ? 
  under what circumstances would you support sanctions ? 
  what would he have to do ? 
  aka take a break from politics . 
  it 's mainly a catholic thing or where there was lots of use of stone for little outbuildings before the reformation ( see the finnish example ) . 
  no tradition of stone outbuildings that might survive a relocated church + reformation = few roadside chapels . 
  i have n't actually been to that region and it looks nice ... mostly wooded too , unlike most of nl which is flat fields . 
  het gooi is the area around hilversum , in the centre of the netherlands . 
  it is a slightly hilly area characterised by its green landscape , its historical charm , the wealth of its inhabitants , and its villas .

  fixed . 
  still , only four countries = do n't read too much into it . 
  yeah , you hit the jackpot among european countries . 
  i was also asking about charming towns , which i thought you had too . 
  some more : https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/4b/8a/b6/4b8ab6bfb56ab91c485dcef5a92209c5.jpg https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jl_2lomcjw4gbrvsvgpgndydqyg=/0x600/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4942799/01222014_chinese_village_0083for_20web.0.jpg, 
  where is the first ? 
  looks like scotland . 
  also , is n't het gooi pretty ? 
  i happen to like where i live in florida . 
  it takes effort to find the really special places but so worth it ... http://www.oldcity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hp-banner2-e1430940420602-1.jpg http://youshouldgotoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/historic-district-st-augustine-fl.jpg http://cdn.visitsouthwalton.com/sites/default/master/files/_02h6757_rosemary.jpg http://www.sunnyislesmiamirealestate.com/images/photos/miami_beach/aqua_miami_beach_3.png http://useppa.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/aerial3.jpg http://65.media.tumblr.com/1074355f482e7686ba8517a42107d73c/tumblr_nscrcn7uhv1uysrqyo1_1280.jpg http://www.villageofthearts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/imgp3775-web.jpg http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/seminolewar/10444851/244662/244662_640.jpg http://youshouldgotoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/historic-2nd-street-cedar-key.jpg some neat stuff tucked in between the suburbs . 
  i also like northern new mexico and cape cod . 
  favorites i 've been to worldwide are colombia ( bogota and caribbean coast ) followed by prague , venice and islands , st barthelemy , bermuda . 
  guadeloupe , martinique , and st barts are pretty special too ... dunno about mayotte , guyane , and wallis . 
  small sample sizes . 
  wales is n't fair as they 've no east coast, 
  do you think it 's important for denmark to just ignore the us ? 
  do n't try to fix their problems but do n't allow them to export them to your country . 
  wow ... for that population and for a relatively poor country it 's pretty impressive . 
  [ meanwhile in the us , if you have a stick , not only will the officer not be charged , but if you try to sue it can get thrown out . 
  ] ( http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/miami-gardens/article96739512.html ) the burden of proof for killing someone in the us is the same as that for making an arrest or searching their home - probable cause . 
  [ meanwhile in the us , even if the suspect is armed with a stick the victim 's family ca n't even sue . 
  not even charges or criminal time . 
  ] ( http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/miami-gardens/article96739512.html ), 
  i 'd rather have a banana thrown at me than bullets . 
  also , dat architecture . 
  every major traditional european style and then some ... 
  when 's best to see the old ways : vampires , witches , traditional gypsies who tell fortunes and ride wagons as opposed to the stealing kind ? 
  / s it 's just that i know europe does n't want another wave of poor , largely male immigrants who do n't speak their language and often have a criminal record . 
  i 'm not saying that us police practices are enough to merit the eu resettling large amounts of youngish black men , but we definitely could learn a lesson from you guys . 
  plus i hear romania has some really good wine . 
  [ funniest german political ad ... although only in english ] ( http://www.oddee.com/_media/imgs/articles2/a96755_a489_oliver-loser.jpg ), 
   but , that did n't stop sv from coughing up this cringy shit . 
   wtf ... 
  most czech response possible . 
  no , but they look `` white '' ( by us standards ) . 
  they 'd likely be assumed to have some italian or `` black irish '' ancestry , with a few looking `` russian '' ; the second guy left of the cross looks ultra-greek though . 
  til the white-nonwhite line is drawn in different places depending on culture ( in the us it 's if you 're from europe , excluding maybe kalmyk buddhists in russia and very dark armenians/azeris , or are a christian arab ) .
