  i 'm just curious why democracy is viewed as so holy in western culture , above and beyond tolerance and human dignity . 
  i 've always seen it as a tool to create more stable and prosperous cultures , not something that is in and of itself a human right . 
  british : irreligious/mainline protestant with a sprinkling of catholics , jews , muslims , and ~ ~ nutcases ~ ~ evangelicals , mainly drinks beer , generally fairly comfortable but pays through the nose on housing , not very homophobic but still has a lot of respect for tradition ( and burberry ! ), 
  american : kitchen sink christianity ( pentecostals , evangelicals , mormons , jw 's , more cults than you can shake a stick at , with some mainline protestants , catholics , jews , and seculars ) , mainly drinks pisswater or wine , precarious financially but has lots of disposable income when things go right , fairly homophobic in parts but tolerant in others with no real regard for traditional institutions/values except for the stuff in leviticus . 
  only up to a point . 
  those with the credentials to move to the eu likely would still have to pay . 
  culturally as different as i can think of within the eu . 
  orthodox ( mainly ) , drinks rakia instead of beer , poorer , relatively more homophobic and traditional ... 
  slavic peoples are generally thought of as white in my experience . 
  does n't nothing last forever , though ? 
  give it enough time and it 'll die down . 
  so a white bulgarian-born immigrant who 's naturalized is seen as more `` danish '' than someone who 's say half danish half somaliand who looks visibly mixed ? 
  [ le plessis-robinson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/le_plessis-robinson ) is indirectly named after robinson crusoe , set off the coast of venezuela . 
  and if you trust google maps , they 're all charming . 
  fuck slovenia ... where all your ugly towns at ? 
  england has a westward ho !, 
  ( [ the exclamation point is part of the name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/westward_ho ! ) ), 
  there 's also rosia montana ( in romania ) and a ton of * monta\u00f1as * in spain . 
  it 's a generic romance word , not directly named after the us state . 
  ijck . 
  [ no , there 's also this ] ( http://www.solamito-properties-real-estate.com/photoquartierbig/2300/1200/55368d2174c90-mc-ville.jpg ) and [ this ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/f6/7c/89/exterior-at-monte-carlo.jpg ) . 
  is it really that ugly ? 
  i always thought of it as gorgeous but full of obnoxious rich fucks . 
  yeah , it makes no bloody sense outside the us . 
  it only exists because the only four day weekend in the american calendar occurs about a month before christmas thanks to a us-only holiday that falls on a thursday . 
   telford your classic english `` new town '' : it 's neither new ( it 's a mash of villages , some quite old , that do n't really fit into the master plan ) nor a town ( again , it 's a patchwork of old villages and market towns with american-style suburban sprawl in between ) . 
   slough sounds just like it looks . 
  i believe the former also have some yiddish influence . 
  the mid 20th century was bad for architecture and planning pretty much everywhere . 
  even general franco could n't stop it . 
  i think spain , switzerland , and ireland also have travellers descended from `` white '' people who became nomadic due to circumstances or preference and who have mixed to some extent ethnically or culturally with roma gypsies . 
  are they related to romani/gypsies ? 
  `` prettier '' apparently means giant stone lions . 
  are those occupied by italian-american gangsters ? 
  and wallonie . 
  the pittsburgh of europe . 
  what 's so bad about yerevan ? 
  [ already found an uglier city - armavir ] ( https://static.panoramio.com.storage.googleapis.com/photos/large/104596391.jpg ) . 
  hrastnik still is n't outright ugly , and it gets urban planning points for its density . 
  [ it could be worse ] ( http://www.nordnorge.com/sites/n/nordnorge.com/files/8baec3805b0ef2bcbbb3360059837cd9.jpg ) , [ even west of ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/donf_ujmfcg/maxresdefault.jpg ) [ the iron ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_x9ztw4ugwcm/tiug9uwcsni/aaaaaaaajtc/4jbu3wbidhq/s1600/bellvitge2cj1.jpg ) [ curtain .

  because it 's one of the three not-super-duper-charming towns in slovenia on street view ( jesenice and either hrastnik or kidricevo are the others i know of ) , and because you have laibach . 
   sortland . 
   molde . 
   looking through : not bad actually pretty but for all the industry dear god , was it settled by smurfs ? 
  and all that fucking pavement makes it look like texas . 
  not terrible , just modern not bad more ugly industry,

   first and foremost , the netherlands is defenately not the most beautifull countrie on the continent of europe . 
  why are you assuming that i am a nationalist ? 
  i find this very offensive realy :(  bias . 
  where do you hide all your ugly towns ? 
  even trbovlje and jesenice do n't look that bad . 
  i have to visit sometime ...

  okay ... 1 ) the part of slovenia that includes bled 2 ) koper 3 ) lendava 4 ) jesenice 5 ) ljubljana 6 ) montenegro 7 ) croatia 8 ) switzerland 9 ) norway/denmark ( tie ) 10 ) austria/italy/andorra ( tie ), 
  from what i 've seen on street view , i concur . 
  montenegro , croatia , switzerland , and probably norway come next . 
  so what you 're saying is 1 ) slovenia 2 ) slovenia 3 ) slovenia 4 ) slovenia 5 ) slovenia seems about right . 
  i 've heard the sheep are lovely, 
  do n't you have [ these ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/mobile_home.jpg/250px-mobile_home.jpg ) in nl ? 
  i can never accept a country with trailer parks as beautiful . 
  nations and nationalism are very much social constructs that emerge over generations . 
  if sicilians are accepted as part of the italian nation by the rest of the italian nation , then they 're 100 % italian . 
  it also seems like they had a reverse trump , where the centrists took over a minor francoist party and so have been able to push moderate policies while retaining street cred with the far right : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/people's_party_ ( spain ), 
  it 's called [ moving the overton window right . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overton_window ) the fact that she looks center-left when she 's from * the most traditionally right-wing party in germany * is only going to get worse during four years of trump fanning the flames from the european far-far-right . 
  is there much chance of a trump/le pen-esque faction taking over partido popular ? 
  it seems to have positioned itself nicely as both the heir to franco and as a generally moderate , pro-eu , establishment [ epp member ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people%27s_party_ ( spain \\ ) ) . 
   spain : it does n't really have a far-right party , but it 's center-right party is incredibly populist and broad - similar to the republicans  french republicans or american republicans ? 
  it helps that they 've positioned themselves as the `` francoist '' party and effectively cut off any possibility of someone farther to the right . 
   i wish we had a strong far-left , or any country for that matter to have one , as the left is dead atm . 
  merkel ( ! ), 
  appears to now be the savior of the european centre-left based on what i 'm hearing , as pretty much every major country outside of iberia and southeastern europe is convulsing with a rising far-right : denmark , sweden , france , the uk , poland , hungary ... 
  the issue is cooperation . 
  if paris as a whole implodes because the world 's largest developed polluter undercuts the 192 other countries , then the blame is squarely on the americans and their patrons . 
  there 's two of them : merck & co. , inc. ( nyse : mrk ) , d.b.a. 
  merck sharp & dohme ( msd ) outside the united states and canada , is an american pharmaceutical company and one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world . 
  the company was established in 1891 as the united states subsidiary of the german company merck , which was founded in 1668 by the merck family . 
  merck & co. was nationalized by the us government during world war i and subsequently established as an independent american company in 1917 . 
  while it operates as merck & co. in north america , the original merck based in darmstadt holds the rights to the merck name everywhere else . 
  merck & co. is the world 's seventh largest pharmaceutical company by market capitalization and revenue . 
  its headquarters is located in kenilworth , new jersey . 
  i just realized that i was replying to the polish guy instead of the bulgarian . 
  all tenants : aroma espresso bar , bali cafe and dim sum house , be my juice , bubbleology , costa coffee , ch\u0142opskie jad\u0142o , cinema caf\u00e9 , costa coffee , cukiernia sowa , galicya , greek house , grycan , jeff 's , kfc , la champagnerie , la fragola , mk caf\u00e9 , ** mcdonald 's , mcdonald 's 2 ** , misianka kawiarnia cukiernia , monique bakery & wine , north fish , ohh !,

  there are at least 5 american-owned businesses in this typical polish mall . 
  fixed . 
  the question was about goods made or promoted `` from american companies '' , regardless of their place of manufacture . 
  at least in american english it does n't read that way . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  pizza hut , ge , nike , polo , kfc , subway , mall of sofia ( built by ge capital ) ... 
  the miller part is american , the sab is south african . 
  i did n't say american made . 
  i said made by an american company . 
  made in the us ? 
  not much .
