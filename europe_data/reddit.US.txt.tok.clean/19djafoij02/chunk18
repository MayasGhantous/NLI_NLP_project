  - low homeownership is mainly a german/austrian/swiss thing ; southern european countries have homeownership rates exceeding those of the us . 
  many leases in germany do not include appliances , so tinkering/diy even at home is not uncommon . 
  do you ever have michael brown-type situations in which civilians assault police ? 
  how does your country 's police respond when such a thing happens ? 
  would you support your country granting asylum to young african-american men instead of , or in addition to , syrians ? 
  what about african-americans or poor americans as a whole ?

  economic issues : inequality is a human rights violation so long as some people can not afford the necessities of daily life without debt and should be kept as low as humanly possible . 
  the optimal gini coefficient is probably in the teens . 
  once everyone has affordable education and healthcare , we can start talking about inequality . 
  the birth lottery is an affront to morality and all should have a roughly equal start in a meritocracy . 
  all gainfully employed people should have their housing and health needs taken care of . 
  religion the world 's religions should be looked at together , and their commonalities should be used to inform policy . 
  immigrants who wish to practice their religion should do so discreetly . 
  lgbt rights are good , but the kim davises of the world should be protected so long as at least one clerk in a given county is willing to sign gay marriages . 
  abortion should be officially frowned upon . 
  immigration people from the developing world should have a right to migrate to rich countries if and only if they make all reasonable efforts to assimilate ( you chose the country , you do n't get to tell them what to do ) . 
  cultural nationalism is a necessary evil , although ideally all countries should be encouraged to adopt nordic values on economic issues . 
  nonviolence gun ownership should not exist , and police should face the burden of proving their innocence in shootings or other brutality allegations ( not criminally , but they should have to have a preponderance of the evidence to show that if they had n't engaged in the conduct in question that they or others would 've died or been maimed ) . 
  geopolitics should be based on the principles of a balance between socialism and capitalism , and nonviolence . 
  environment global warming is a threat to civilization and denying its existence should be a disqualification from serving in elected office ( a litmus test , meaning i 'd almost never vote for them ) . 
  i believe i am a pretty standard progressive ( my main problems with sanders are tactical and strategic , not ideological , ergo clinton voter ) . 
  my ideology follows from my nonsectarian theist beliefs in the right to life , justice , and free choice/contracts . 
  the ones that are fully integrated into the eu are guadeloupe , martinique guyane ( french guiana ) r\u00e9union , mayotte, 
  moldova has like half the gdp of ukraine , which has like 1/3 that of russia .

  historically , there have been some ethnic minorities that have been disproportionately rich and/or powerful ( baltic germans , swedish-speaking finns , irish protestants ) .

  i ask as a dumb american , 
  i 'm particularly interested in how general franco and the salazar regime are viewed today , but i 'm curious how other recent authoritarian rulers are viewed . 
  i know that you probably do n't have the kind of shootings that you have in the us , but i know that for instance the uk has surveillance issues as well as cover-ups .

  they 're all turkic , muslim-majority countries that straddle the continents ' borders .

  i can think of a few scenarios that i 'm wondering how your nationalists view them : 1 ) a citizen by ancestry , full or partial , born and raised overseas . 
  these are often called `` plastic paddies '' in ireland . 
  2 ) an immigrant who 's naturalized . 
  3 ) a second or third generation immigrant who 's naturalized or the born children of a naturalized immigrant . 
  this first scenario does n't occur as often as in north america because of jus soli . 
  4 ) someone of mixed indigenous and immigrant ancestry . 
  5 ) someone adopted in early childhood ( eg balotelli ) 6 ) an indigenous citizen of an overseas territory or province , if you have them . 
  i 'm not hearing as much about it , although i have heard that some migrants have gone back to the greater middle east .

  yankees is often shortened to '' [ yanks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yankee ) '' even though , like holland and england , it initially referred to a part of the us , namely the north . 
  these being - catalunya , valencia , the balearics , parts of aragon and murcia , andorra , rousillon , and alguer in italy . 
  do you see them as part of a `` greater catalonia '' and do you consider them catalans/catalonians ?
