  furthermore , do you believe that indigenous peoples in the americas and australia have the right to fight back against white people there , even though they 're no longer in the majority ? 
  also , are there religious/sectarian ( catholic vs protestant ) and generational implications , and how can you tell if someone named say erich maria or marie-joseph is a man or a woman ? 
  guaranteed upvote from me if you have pix of their house ( s ) . 
  former pms and presidents as well as opposition leaders are also welcome . 
  for instance , saying `` i do n't like somalis/serbs/canadians / americans/gypsies/muslims '' when it comes up in a casual conversation .

  does this seem accurate to you in terms of `` europeanness '' ? 
  the past two decades , that is . 
  the dream was that i ( a non-european ) was on a [ lisbon tram ] ( http://www.lisbon.net/pictures/lisbon-tram-28.jpg ) and was listening to music or media . 
  i have a problem with mumbling under my breath when i 'm listening to media , and without my knowledge was mumbling `` death to america , death to america , death to america '' in english . 
  i wound up in a portuguese prison . 
  i know this is a more lighthearted post than you 're used to , but how would a guy listening to music and mumbling `` death to america '' on mass transit be handled in your city and country ? 
  ancient , medieval , early modern ... you name it . 
  did your country or its ancestors have bans on certain ethnic or religious groups ( jews , muslims , roma gypsies , etc ) during the late middle ages/early renaissance ? 
  did they ever expel or deport multi-generational residents ? 
  would you exclude all muslim-majority countries or just those that have a history of radicalism ? 
  would it be complete , or would skilled workers on blue card or self employed programs still be allowed in ? 
  would you cancel existing visas , up to people who are already in transit ? 
  would you apply it to tourists too ? 
  would you apply it to christian , hindu , and other minorities from those countries ? 
  in [ switzerland ] ( http://www.behindmagazine.com/mag/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/swatch_f4s_este_sm_1017_1200_800.jpg ) , they 're only allowed at certain events in certain towns . 
  norway i think too . 
  are these very small watercraft allowed in most parts of your country and are they popular ? 
  from what i can find on the internet , kaliningrad seems revoltingly ugly as so much of old k\u00f6nigsberg was leveled and hastily rebuilt in the aftermath of wwii . 
  [ the gothic cathedral , for instance , sits in a sea of commie blocks .

  am i missing something , or is kaliningrad really that ugly ? 
  you can start with modern history after the french revolution if you wish . 
  if so , what is the combination of legal , political , and cultural measures that have created such a resistance ?

  in both cases , you have ostensibly neutral laws that significantly benefit a minority of the population ( whites in rhodesia and republicans/rurals in the us ) and that are structurally very difficult to change nonviolently within the system - rhodesia used a system of class qualifications to effectively [ exclude blacks from the most powerful seats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/politics_of_rhodesia ) , and the us has a combination of disenfranchisement , gerrymandering/fptp , and the electoral college that significantly limit the ability of democrats to be represented ( 54 % of american voters voted for non-republican presidential candidates , 56 % for non-republican senators , and 51 % for non-republican house candidates , and yet in each case the republicans have control with no nonviolent limits ) . 
  can and should the us be considered to be a `` rhodesian democracy '' , and more importantly would the us electoral system be considered free and fair if it was implemented in a small , poor country like rhodesia ? 
  for instance , protests/marches in support or opposition to him , trump-inspired events , politicians citing/tweeting him , debates on the role of the us under him , etc. 
  i 'd imagine that indigenous spanish gypsies are viewed quite a bit more positively than the poor migrants from romania and bulgaria . 
  say , if a citizen was a marxist/right-wing populist/religious conservative/open borders antifa , could she be fired , lose friends , and/or be ostracized ? 
  or do people generally not give a crap so long as you are n't obnoxious about it ? 
  i 'll define `` english-language '' as having at least one full sentence or line in english . 
  do you consider those states to be legitimate , and do you think that european governments and populations should push them to adopt western democratic values using every method short of war ? 
  [ all i know is what 's in this stereotype map and that fishing rights are a big reason that iceland is staying out of the eu . 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cpcpnwsw8aal6pq.jpg ), 
  and if an existing eu member were to adopt say the electoral college , gerrymandering , voter registration , fptp with nominally private primaries , would it face sanctions for not being democratic enough ? 
  not necessarily a person from your country . 
  if you think people will still be talking about trump or bieber , go ahead and answer them .

  i know that some countries allow parliament to call an election by a majority in parliament anytime and austria has postponed or rerun elections in the past year . 
  what mechanisms do you have and how would you handle a situation similar to that between trump and russia ( partisan having and ties to a foreign government ) ? 
  meaning a company that 's owned by relatives and passed down over the generations . 
  in the us , they 're sometimes viewed very positively as backbones of the economy that are n't as greedy as shareholder companies , but also sometimes as a bit nepotistic . 
  what 's the popular perception of family-owned businesses where you are ? 
  think clinton v. trump in 2016 level humiliating . 
  career killing , name tarnishing , party damaging . 
  this can be either sending or receiving countries . 
  i 've heard that in some countries they ca n't find a job and end up homeless or going home broke ... is that common ? 
  * eu migrants =  people who move from one eu or eea member to another, 
  i 've heard two main definitions : v4 + slovenia and german-speaking countries ( germany , austria , and sometimes switzerland ) what definition do you generally use ? 
  and if so , would it be legal for the eu to adopt such a preference ? 
  i see it as a win-win ; the eu gets more immigrants who share western values and ancestry , can score anti-trump points by taking in americans , and can introduce them to social democracy . 
  i think a 2 year exchange visa would really help americans be more open minded and would hopefully squeeze out some muslim zealots . 
  what do you think ? 
  i know that at least in the netherlands the emigration was heavily `` seceding '' protestant compared to the population as a whole . 
  what was the general makeup of your country 's emigrants ? 
  i 'm going to europe this summer and i have a history of barroom anti-americanism and a very self-deprecating sense of humor .

  - media globalization means that european cops and criminals are more aggressive than before as they 're under american influence - daesh uses very similar `` tactics '' to american street thugs ( attempting to disarm law enforcement , driving cars at cops or crowds ) - more americans have access to real and realistic guns as well as to automobiles - the lack of a welfare state and public healthcare means that americans are more likely to behave erratically / `` crazily '' compared to western and central europeans in other words , if your country 's cops were assigned to police american streets or if american criminals began arriving in europe , do you think that the use of force would normalize towards american levels ?

  [ third in a series . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/66s7mk/eastern_europeans_which_western_country_is/ ) i 'm american , and i 'd probably say the uk - but relative to population , there 's disproportionately influence from northern ireland ( like 2 % of the uk ) vs. england , scotland , and wales . 
  the heavily `` scots-irish '' culture of much of the south and midwest that makes americans `` american '' ( country music , evangelical protestantism , even fried chicken ) is of [ northern irish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scotch-irish_americans ) origin , as is over a tenth of the white population ( 27 million americans ) and 1/3 of our presidents .

  these are a couple of my favorite blogs that critique kitsch/tacky/ugly by design houses : http://uglybelgianhouses.tumblr.com/ http://mcmansionhell.com the first is ( duh ) belgian , the second is american .

  independent warning . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/noam-chomsky-republican-party-most-dangerous-organisation-human-history-us-politics-mit-linguist-a7706026.html ) sorry for asking another / r/shitamericanssay question , but europe has experienced some pretty damaging organizations ( the nazis , the medieval church , the stalinists , isis ) and i 'd like some perspective . 
  i 'm using liberal in the sense of `` liberal democracy '' , meaning the spectrum between social democracy on the left and neoliberal conservatism on the right . 
  think hong kong , monaco , or liechtenstein . 
  there are limits to how much power the general public has vs. those groomed from birth to rule ( meaning that anti-immigration and populist hardliners are limited in how much power they can claim ) , but there still is a quite good human rights record , freedom of speech , welfare system , and protection of property rights . 
  as a progressive who ca n't wait for the older generations of nationalists to die off  i find that those countries definitely have some advantages . 
  [ there 's a big concern about europe retaining its sovereignty when so much of its it sector runs on american or chinese software . 
  ] ( https://thenextweb.com/eu/2017/05/10/europe-is-living-under-microsofts-digital-killswitch/ ) do you think that the eu can remain social-democratic , environmentally conscious , and multilingual/multiethnic/plurinational while still remaining sovereign over its economy and attracting/sparking the best and the brightest firms in a broad array of industries ? 
  i do n't see why that would be an issue ( many of the most innovative and highest-wage economies are small , social-democratic countries like sweden and denmark that could easily become a template for europe as a whole , and while there 's somewhat of a ceiling in terms of ordinary wages sweden has more billionaires per capita than the us ) . 
  [ here 's a wiki background . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight_and_expulsion_of_germans_ ( 1944 % e2 % 80 % 9350 \\ ) ) it was both nazi and soviet policy to move germans westward , and many central and eastern european german-speaking communities were erased - with the remainders often being cleaned up by assimilation and economic migration after the fall of communism . 
  i know that in some cases the uk for instance has been trying to deport criminals to serve their sentence in their home countries so they are n't a burden to taxpayers , to the point where they 've even offered to build a prison for jamaica . 
  how is this issue handled in your country ?
