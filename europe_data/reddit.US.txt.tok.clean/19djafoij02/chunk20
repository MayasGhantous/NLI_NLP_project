  i myself see this country rapidly turning into apartheid south africa and see no way for democratic majority rule to return without foreign pressure , mass protests , or bloodshed because of how the very constitution favors rural voters and how the massively unpopular gop is manipulating the voting process to disenfranchise the majority of the public , all the while our government behaves in ways that are directly detrimental to legitimate nation states in europe and elsewhere . 
  do you think that such a voluntary boycott-divest-sanctions approach is the best way to force reform , and do you think your leaders should press it ? 
  i 'm already considering positions in other countries so i can fight for change at home and abroad . 
  ed : thank you for your patience . 
  i had a long morning dealing with trump-supporting coworkers . 
  see http://englishrussia.com/2015/11/29/40-most-crazy-russian-balconies/, 
  this includes dual citizens ( for instance , by descent ) who moved to a european country as well as those who arrived as legal immigrants on visas . 
  [ french president emmanuel macron has invited americans with `` green jobs '' to come to france . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/emmanuel-macron-american-climate-scientists-france-2017-5 ) i do n't know if it is legal for an eu member to offer work visas to a specific non-eu country , but i see a lot of potential from the us ' large , generally well-skilled population and i believe that many americans would able to fit into a european way of life ( to a greater extent than the mena migrants that predominate across today 's europe and that often result in blanket anti-immigration sentiment ; the culture shock is mainly political and mainly has to do with americans not having lived under a social-democratic or social-liberal system ) . 
  it seems like in many european countries the center and right are exploding in popularity while the remaining left voters are moving to smaller fringe or green parties . 
  nl , de , fr , serbia , and arguably austria ( if you consider vdb a centrist ) are examples . 
  how 's your country 's mainstream center left doing ? 
  please no politics ; as a card-carrying floridian i apologize for bush , the housing crisis , and the rise of trump and let 's keep it at that . 
  inspired by this article : https://www.thecanary.co/2017/05/25/tories-just-lost-court-case-finally-expose-stealth-privatisation-nhs/ it seems to me like the uk is breaking with europe in more ways than just brexit and in some ways is closer to the us than europe politically . 
  are these sorts of problems affecting any continental european countries ? 
  editing in : are there any political parties that would support such a measure ? 
  i 'm thinking somewhere like sweden or the netherlands where most people speak fluent english but many companies still require local language fluency . 
  should that be relaxed in order to improve european integration and would it be politically controversial ? 
  i 'm especially thinking the nordic countries , netherlands , estonia , czechia , and probably some other areas ( northern germany ? 
  this includes longstanding indigenous christian communities ( the bible belt in the netherlands , for instance ) , converts , and immigrants from eastern europe , the us , and developing countries . 
  in light of brexit and trump , have those events impacted their campaign strategies or rhetoric ? 
  how are they addressing these two english-speaking developments ? 
  i keep hearing that the focus on civics education , introducing schoolchildren to political philosophy , the enlightenment , democracy , etc. 
  is very much an american thing and that in many countries there is n't much of an emphasis on reading and learning the different parts of the constitution , the different philosophies of government , natural rights , etc. 
  how is government taught in your country ? 
  i was first introduced to the actual text constitution of the usa in middle school and was first introduced to political philosophy in 9th grade . 
  i hear horror stories about homelessness and eu citizens going home penniless or being deported because they ca n't find a job . 
  are these commonplace and would you support free language classes for eu migrants ? 
  1 ) share my real views and dislike of the us , which include targeted sanctions , denormalizing the us , accepting anti-trump and black refugees , and downgrading relations but which might offend some europeans who have american ties . 
  2 ) similar , but tone them down . 
  3 ) i do n't want to get into politics ... i 'm on vacation . 
  i know that there are some people in the eu ( there 's a redditor in finland i think who says he 's never worked a day in his life and yet has a better life than me ) who have been able to make a nice life off benefits , but it sounds like he 's gaming the system to a greater or lesser extent . 
  is there any country in the european migration area that guarantees a decent standard of living for all citizens who are able to find work there ?

  * this is a riff on a heavily downvoted post i did yesterday that i decided to go back on and improve . 
  if your country does n't already have a visa program like those below that could easily be marketed to americans , please refrain from commenting * considering the economic , political , and police issues in the us , i think that it might be profitable for european countries that already have visa pathways for under $ 20,000 to market them towards americans . 
  these are the ones i could find ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) : ** daft ** - this treaty makes it easy for us entrepreneurs to emigrate to the netherlands if they can set up a self-sustaining business . 
  it 's 2 years , open to all us citizens , and can be renewed to place oneself on a path to permanent residency and/or citizenship . 
  ** education in germany ** - the all-in costs ( including cost of living expenses ) i believe are about $ 12,000 / year ( 10,000 eur - tuition is free or nominal but you have to show enough money in the bank ) and most masters and even some bachelor 's degrees are in english . 
  otherwise , german is fairly similar to english in terms of being related . 
  ** spain ** i know has both self-employed and auxiliar de conversaci\u00f3n visas and the ** czech republic ** also has a self-employed visa . 
  uncertain about the cost of those two . 
  if i were an employee in the german , dutch , spanish , or czech government , i 'd seriously consider launching an ad campaign in working-class areas of the us to promote them , but i 'm just a ` murican . 
  what do people from countries with those sorts of visas think of them and would you like to see your country take advantage of them ? 
  examples : http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/shooting-munich-germany-train-station-after-cop-s-gun-grabbed-n771381 http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/06/europe/notre-dame-incident-paris-france/index.html http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38853841, 
  i know i 'm a bit to the left of most of you on this issue , but if there is evidence of such suppression that resulted in one party getting compete power then i think that no country should recognize that election and that , if that illegitimate government is taking away people 's healthcare it 's the responsibility of humanity to assist the victims while resisting the government . 
  i feel that violence here is almost inevitable and that there is literally an occupying regime , and personally am looking forward to get out of the us and hopefully change my citizenship . 
  do you agree with my views and would they be viewed as acceptable in your region ? 
  i know of the cinque terre in italy as well as strasbourg and colmar in alsace . 
  what are some others ? 
  in my discussions with you guys , i 've come to the conclusion that i might be a bit naive by trying to be empathetic to all and assuming most people can be converted to social democracy just by living in europe . 
  for instance , i imagine that if europe took in a million random trump supporters from the us for a year , 990,000 would abandon their american beliefs and become european social democrats ... the only reason the us is n't a social democracy is that too few people know what social democracy is like . 
  am i assuming that evangelism is too easy and people are more rational and good than they are ? 
  i could see them changing either way : `` turkey and isis show that the ideology of islam is the problem and we need to support the forces of civilization in israel , the west bank , and gaza as they fight the war against islamic terrorism . 
  if israel surrenders even one kilometer it 'll give the terrorists the license to go after us next unless we crush islam first . '', 
  or `` the israeli occupation provides fuel for terrorist ideologies to spread and until it ends terrorism will never end . '', 
  we in the us have complete right-wing control except for a few states , and many european countries alternate between left and right . 
  do you think that a consensus-based model would be workable and better than what you have if you do n't , and do you like it if you have it ? 
  1 ) my country should ban islam and deport all muslims , even if they 're indigenous converts . 
  2 ) poor and left-of center americans have the right to use force against the government to secure their rights to healthcare . 
  3 ) violence against the us government in the name of the climate is acceptable . 
  4 ) we should work with china , india , cuba , and iran over the us and saudi arabia . 
  5 ) ending religious extremism worldwide should be part of western foreign policy . 
  6 ) american republicans , including the president , should be denied entry to our country until they adopt more moderate policies . 
  7 ) we should share 90 % of our income with africans , asians , and latin americans . 
  8 ) the biggest failure of colonialism was our inability to fully westernize the natives . 
  9 ) socialism and communism should be banned if they favor abolishing the right to property . 
  10 ) we should have launched a regime change operation in syria with hundreds of thousands of nato troops . 
  note : i hold only 1 of these 10 views , 4 . 
  as a naive american , it looks to basically be comparable to the establishment wing of the us [ republican party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_people%27s_party ) , and the farthest right of any non-authoritarian party in western or central europe . 
  `` small government '' , lower taxes , less welfare , conservative values , etc. 
  but i 'm just an american . 
  is the svp out of line with other european right-of-center parties ? 
  also , why would you choose such a thing over marriage ? 
  in my experience there 's a continuum between a highly integrated ethnic minority ( frisians ) and an indigenous population that 's stereotyped as being poor and constantly drunk ( indigenous australians , indigenous canadians , native americans ) . 
  where do the sami land in terms of popular imagination as well as in terms of statistics ?

  christoffa corombo ( christopher columbus ) comes to mind . 
  born in what is now italy , married in portugal , died in spain , so all three countries can claim him . 
  are there more ? 
  let 's also exclude factually incorrect or racist opinions . 
  should you treat those who you disagree with respectfully in your culture ? 
  i try to respect everyone , even trump supporters , and would n't insult them to their face . 
  i 'm what 's called a utilitarian philosophically , in that i look at what will create the greatest improvement in human welfare , so i think that national immigration policies should take into account not only skills , but adaptability ( how likely is said immigrant to succeed in the eu based on their country 's standards for gender equality and the prevalence of common european lingua francas like english and spanish ) and humanitarian benefits ( will they face a much lower likelihood of violent death or incarceration , including at the hands of police they should trust for - say - waving around a toy gun in public , which we can all agree should not be a capital crime ? 
  will they get access to much better healthcare ? ), 
  by those standards i imagine that immigration would be dominated by americans and latin countries . 
  should those factors be taken into account alongside skill profiles and net worth ? 
  i imagine it would be very tempting for a rejected asylum seeker to just rob a bank and live on taxpayer dime for the duration of their sentence in a relatively comfortable european prison . 
  do n't worry , i 'm definitely not gon na ask about russia too since it 's already partially in europe ( and expanding its european holdings every day ) . 
  us media trying to make universal healthcare look bad ? 
  uk interfering in parents ' right to do what 's best for their kids ? 
  something else ? 
  i 've always been fairly center-left by us standards ( ie right wing by eu standards ) , but i 've moved further and further left seeing what the us has become , to the point that i now support policies that you 'd likely find center left : a global welfare state , downgrading diplomatic relations with the us and other countries that do n't have a fully representative democracy , skepticism for so called realists who appease republicans , mandatory and automatic voting with enhanced representation for the young , ed : social regulation of nationalism and condemnation of ultranationalism , and nonviolent sabotage or harassment against those who choose to harm the environment or take healthcare away from fellow humans . 
  how have you evolved in the age of brexit and trump ? 
  in the us where i live , between 47 % - 48 % of people voted democratic in recent federal elections but democrats have minimal power beyond protest and violence . 
  is that acceptable ? 
  i know many countries have majority coalitions , often ideological , that often exclude those parties that are on the less popular side of the spectrum . 
  1 ) hate speech should not be a crime except for active politicians , government employees , and celebrities .
