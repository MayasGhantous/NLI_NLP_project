i bring my own oil , 
  in 20 minutes i 'm gon na colon-ize uranus . 
  that is n't true . 
  sometimes it hurts to try . 
  maybe obama asked the french government , but then [ censored out ] ( http://thefederalist.com/2016/04/01/the-obama-white-house-just-censored-a-foreign-leader-who-mentioned-islamist-terrorism/ ) the audio of hollande 's response . 
  i think you mean brexperts, 
   but these search terms have the same intention behind them not necessarily . 
  you could also search for `` eu '' or `` european union '' if you wanted to see the latest news related to the eu . 
  after the paris terror attacks , i 'm sure that searches for `` paris '' increased . 
  that does n't mean that people were ignorant of paris beforehand . 
   if you sign up for a gym membership for 7 years and want out after 4 , do you get your money back ? 
  if you paid up front ? 
  probably not . 
  but most gyms do n't make you pay for 7 years up front . 
  that would be nuts . 
  usually gyms are billed on a monthly basis and the gym contract has terms of cancellation . 
  i 'd expect a fee of some sort , but i 'd also expect that fee to be less than several years ' worth of membership fees !, 
  in the end , though , the real price of leaving the gym is that you 'll never get truly swole . 
   if you make a commitment for 3 years of comcast ( just trying to put in terms you guys might understand ) and then after half a year realize that google fiber comes to your area ( haha !, 
  ) , wopwould n't be able to simply send back the comcast modem to them and not pay the last two years . 
   you 'd need to pay the rest of your commitment , whether you want to or not . 
  most consumer commitments do n't require you to pay the full amount . 
  usually there are fees for breaking your contract period , but i 've never heard of a contract that requires you to pays years worth of bills if you end service early . 
  is that how it works in the netherlands ? 
  seems draconian . 
  in any case , relating consumer contracts to supranational agreements is probably not a great comparison . 
  they are very different realms . 
   you 're member of a club maintaining a building . 
  you 've agreed to contribute some money for the next four years of maintenance . 
  now you want out , can you claim you do n't have to pay any more ? 
  you can say no , but you can understand why the others might be annoyed . 
  in most situations like that you would pay a pro-rated amount . 
  for example , if you occupied the building for 1 of the 4 years , you would pay 25 % of the 4 year total . 
  is n't england something like 84 % of the uk 's population ? 
   trying to paint it as a slur when the dictionary dose n't do so it 's a clear stretch to try and fit a wrong meaning . 
  using it negatively makes it a slur . 
  who taught you english ? 
   it 's not about lenguage confusion , saying top level comments is differen than saying top comments . 
  they are two different things . 
  christ , are you still ranting about this ? 
  i 've clarified this multiple times . 
  `` top comments '' can mean either thing . 
  i meant it in the sense of `` top-level comments . '', 
   i 'm arguing that you are trying to defend to_donald at any cost . 
  if you are doing in bad faith only you know exactly saying that i 'm arguing `` at any cost '' ** is ** saying that i 'm arguing in bad faith . 
  again , do they teach rhetoric in italy ? 
   i say at this point we both act like the bigger men oh , so now you 're discriminating against midgets too . 
   it 's not in any way an insult , it 's a quote from this very famous ancient saying . 
  there are plenty of old sayings that are offensive or filled with bigotry . 
  if someone says they `` jewed the price down '' it 's still offensive , despite being an old phrase . 
  that 's because it depicts jewishness as a negative thing . 
  you used `` deaf '' as a negative thing . 
  that 's pretty discriminatory against deaf people . 
   how is saying that you are trying to defend the_donald at any cost a personal attack ? 
  because you 're saying that i 'm arguing in bad faith . 
  do n't they still teach rhetoric in italy ? 
   i just debunked you whole argument from top to end in my previous comments which argument was that ? 
   you did n't talk about top level comments in your first comment responding to me . 
  you simply talked about top comments . 
  same thing . 
  although i later clarified ( ** four ** times now ) to clear up your language confusion . 
  i guess you 're still confused . 
  maybe you should consult a native english speaker ? 
   that 's what top comments mean . 
  and since then i 've explained what i meant more explicitly to try to bridge the language difficulties that you 're having . 
  i 've explained this three times now . 
  [ here 's a link if you are still confused . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/nostupidquestions/comments/41vmzx/whats_a_top_level_comment/ )  if you go on a thread and sort the comments by top comments what is going to show up are the most upvoted ones . 
  actually , the reddit algorithm is more complicated than that . 
  but whatever . 
   making up false accusations of me using slurs to insult disabled people now you 're claiming that you * did n't * use a `` deaf '' as an insult ? 
  wow . 
  you know we can still read your comment , right ? 
   that 's not in any way a personal attack nor a slur . 
  deaf is a slur ? 
  it 's the standard word of the english language to define those that ca n't hear . 
  using it ** as an insult ** makes it a slur . 
  context matters . 
  please learn how to speak english before attempting to preach to me about semantics . 
   you to try and defend the_donald at any cost yup . 
  more personal attacks . 
  i guess you have no real argument , so you have to attack me personally . 
  very sad . 
  -- edit : i noticed that you downvoted me [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zlrut/ipsos_exit_poll_for_nosrtl_vvd_31_cda_19_d66_19/df0608i/ ) . 
  can you explain why you 're violating rediquette ? 
   why did you bring up top comments ( which get to the position of top comment because of upvotes ) top-level comments are the ones that are made directly to the op , rather than in response to another comment . 
  the top-level comments that show up first vary depending on reddit 's algorithm . 
  you seem like you 're confused ; either about the english language or about how reddit works . 
    you are the one who brought up upvotes originally . 
  my comment was in response to that . 
   nice alternative fact you got there . 
  what alternative fact is that ? 
  are you claiming that you were n't the first one to mention upvotes ? 
  or are you just rattling off english-language buzzwords ( like `` alternative fact '' ) without understanding them ? 
   also did you happen to read the rediquette?because it says that downvotes should be used on post that do not contribute to the discussion and not as a mean to disagree like you just did with my comment above . 
  i downvote personal attacks . 
  your comment above made a slur against disabled people . 
  please try to join the rest of the civilized world by being less discriminatory . 
   nice way to dodge the question . 
  i 'm saying that you ca n't assume the reasons behind upvotes .
