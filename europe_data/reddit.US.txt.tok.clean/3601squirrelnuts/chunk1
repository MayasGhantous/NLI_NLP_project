the national weather service in ... sterling ... virginia ... has issued the following ... tornado warning ... for ... parts of ... fuck your county ( this is how the nws pronounces fauquier county ), 
  my guess is that being a government bailout away from bankruptcy might have had something to do with the improved quality . 
  you 're right though , my next car will probably be my first american car . 
  i really struggled during my trip to italy during july a couple years ago with the lack of ac . 
  our hotel in sienna had ac but it barely worked and , even with the fan on , i was sweating like a whore in church . 
  there is zero evidence that gs sabotaged greece deliberately . 
  greece 's debt situation was a mess before the eurozone accession process began ; that 's why they engaged goldman in the first place . 
  but they also need to prove that gs did n't comply with the terms of the engagement . 
  if the greeks engaged gs to help them get into the eurozone , they can hardly sue them for successfully fulfilling the terms of the engagement . 
  it 's as if a homeowner hired a contractor to paint ther house pink . 
  the contractor then paints it pink , but when the hoa says pink houses are n't allowed , the homeowner sues the painter . 
  that directive does n't go into effect until july 3rd , 2016 . 
  under us law , insider trading only applies to trading in equities ( stocks ) . 
  i do n't know if eu law is different , but i doubt it is ( or else there would be no bond markets in europe ) . 
  hate to burst everyone 's bubble , but greece will get nowhere . 
  there 's nothing illegal about the currency swaps goldman performed for the greek government to help them meet eurozone admission requirements . 
  in addition , if you 'll read all the way through the article , you 'll see that eu rules explicitly allowed those swaps until 2008 . 
  finally , the article confirms that the greek government failed to disclose their currency swaps to eurostat when requested to do so back in 2008 ( when the rules on currency swaps changed ) . 
  everyone knew greece was playing games with their books . 
  the eu chose to ignore the shenanigans . 
  now , everybody 's looking around for another scapegoat since nobody has wanted to take any fucking responsibility for their own actions since this sovereign debt crisis began . 
  goldman is a great scapegoat because everybody 's heard of them , they 've been vilified in the press constantly since 2008 , and very few people actually understand what it is they do . 
  welcome to what happens when your country becomes the biggest kid on the playground . 
  we ( the us ) have become accustomed to being blamed for everything over the years and i 'm sure you will too . 
  just about all of it except for a couple of social issues . 
  sanders is so far left as to be un-electable in the us , however . 
  as a republican , i would jizz in my pants if the democrats were to nominate him . 
  i 've only used either type for baking pies . 
  evaporated ( unsweetened ) milk for pumpkin pie , condensed ( sweetened ) milk for key lime pies . 
  a little bit off-topic , but can any of you scandinavians/icelanders understand any old english/ango-saxon ? 
  [ here 's an example . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isyrraupfu4 ), 
  in the us , we 're taught to make an original argument and to reference evidence to support our argument . 
  the typical exam paper in the us is a `` five paragraph essay , '' which is constructed as follows : 1st paragraph : introduce the general topic and present your basic argument ( `` thesis statement '' ) 2nd-4th paragraphs : each paragraph should include several examples of the same general category of supporting evidence . 
  therefore , you would have three different categories to support your `` thesis statement . '', 
  5th paragraph : summarize and synthesize your argument so that the reader concludes that your thesis statement is correct . 
  in higher grades , you 'll write longer essays or have essays based on evaluating documents ( the ap u.s. history exam uses a document-based essay ) . 
  the general idea remains the same , however . 
  u.s. students are encouraged to present an original argument and can receive lower marks for being unimaginative or simply regurgitating someone else 's opinion . 
  thanks , have some gold . 
  so i 'm here in the land of the free and the home of the whopper , and ca n't vote . 
  is someone willing to vote for montenegro on my behalf ? 
  dafuq is this ? 
  two consecutive good singers at eurovision ? 
  your last winner was indeed imported from the colonies ( katrina & the waves from the usa in 1998 ) . 
  it 's terrible . 
  california passed a proposition that makes it nearly impossible for the state to raise taxes . 
  then , they vote for a bunch of crap that costs money every year . 
  and then they wonder why they 're a fiscal basket-case . 
  my monthly water bill is based on a sliding scale : 0-3 ,000 gallons : $ 10.87 ( 0-11 ,356 liters : $ 10.20 ) 3,001-6 ,000 gallons : $ 14.56 ( 11,357-22 ,712 liters : $ 13.66 ) 6,001-9 ,000 gallons : $ 18.25 ( 22,713-34 ,069 liters : $ 17.12 ) more than 9,000 gallons : $ 21.94 (  34,069 liters : $ 20.95 ) if you regularly use more than 9,000 gallons per month , the county service authority can require you to use a commercial meter which has a different rate schedule . 
  the above rates include the fixed monthly service charge of $ 7.18 ( $ 6.74 ) .

  who says the burgers ca n't into geography ? 
  after visiting the douaumont ossuary at verdun , i will never make another cheese-eating surrender monkey joke ever again . 
  the frenchies sat in their trenches and fought tooth-and-nail over centimeters of ground for 11 months while being bombarded with artillery and gas the whole time . 
  their line never broke . 
  respect . 
  all of that sounds great , but i 'm not so sure i 'd trust the media here in the us to be objective . 
  with the exceptions of fox news and the wall street journal , all of our major media outlets are basically cheerleaders for the democrats to varying degrees .

  in the u.s. , it really depends on your political orientation : republican or right-of-center : * obama * big government/socialism * the liberal media ( in the left-liberal sense ) * china/russia ( it rotates depending on what 's been in the news recently ) * muslims * illegal immigrants * erosion of `` judeo-christian '' values democrat or left-of-center : * george w bush ( and/or dick cheney ) * the `` wealthiest 1 % '' * big corporations * the religious right * the tea party * nafta * israel * fox news and rush limbaugh libertarian : * the federal reserve * the two-party system * the military-industrial complex * big government, 
  nice house of cards reference, 
  did somebody say oil ? 
  this is puerile pseudo-intellectualism at its finest . 
  this was my question too . 
  many rural areas of my country are experiencing dramatic population decline . 
  the exceptions are mainly in areas where there is oil and gas exploration , but there 's no fracking in france as far as i know . 
  yup . 
  [ ksu vs. oregon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp4tep4rw0s ) and [ texas vs. texas a&m ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kklkbpwlhj8 ), 
  nice try , vladimir . 
  i can see that this is just a trick so that you can use the highway to launch a sneak-attack on alaska . 
  we bought it fair and square and you 'll never get it back , you damn commies !, 
  you do n't have to tell me . 
  i 've been supporting dc united since i was in high school . 
  it just has n't caught on nationally until this past year . 
  do n't kid yourself . 
  last summer was the first time it 's been relevant over here since 1994 . 
  i 've only seen that happen twice in my entire life . 
  once was the ksu vs. oregon alamo bowl game two years ago , and the other one was a texas vs. texas a&m game about 10 years ago . 
  we 've got johannsson ( iceland ) and diskerud ( norway ) . 
  how many more do we need ? 
  we had that match in the bag and then we proceeded to shit our pants defensively from the 80th minute onward . 
  we need some serviceable centerbacks so badly . 
  the 3rd danish goal was a [ fucking embarrassment ] ( http://gfycat.com/nextdeliriousalabamamapturtle ) . 
  on the flip side , we showed a bit more creativity in the attacking third than i 'm used to seeing from a us team . 
  aron johannsson is a pimp . 
  actually , we just removed iran from our national threat assessment two days ago . 
  you must hate your life . 
  i feel sorry for you . 
  that breakdown on the us is very interesting . 
  if you 're familiar with where each of those districts is located , you notice a pattern that districts with the highest gini coefficient are almost entirely urban , while the districts with the lowest gini coefficients are either rural areas , or wealthy suburbs . 
  it 's also interesting to see that while nearly all of the districts with high gini coefficients are represented in congress by left-liberal democrats , the districts with higher gini coefficients do n't seem to be politically correlated . 
  the district with the lowest gini is va-11 , which contains the wealthy washington dc suburbs of fairfax county and eastern prince william county south to dumfries . 
  it is represented by a centrist democrat . 
  the district with the 2nd lowest gini is mn-06 , which covers the wealthy exurbs northwest of minneapolis , the city and suburbs of st. 
  cloud , and the rural counties connecting and surrounding the two population centers . 
  this district was represented by ultra-right tea party republican michelle bachmann until last year . 
  the district with the 3rd lowest gini coefficent is ny-02 . 
  this district covers long island and contains southern nassau county east of brookyn and southwestern suffolk county . 
  these suburbs of new york city are prosperous , but not as wealthy as the hamptons further east ( this is district ny-01 ) .
