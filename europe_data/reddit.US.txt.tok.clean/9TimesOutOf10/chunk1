according to [ this , ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/02/rise-anglosphere-how-right-dreamed-new-conservative-world-order ) thatcher endorsed the idea of anglosphere union in 1999 . 
  when we say * liberal , * we 're referring to social liberalism , not economic liberalism . 
  trump is happy to work with anyone who flatters him . 
  but it is at least something positive in the brexit/trump story that we might have a better relationship . 
  maybe it will be something saner governments can build on . 
  what does juncker know ? 
  he lost britain . 
  he could n't get the eu to agree with ttip . 
  perhaps he should spend a few years figuring out what europe is . 
  http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-10-at-9.57.16-am.png if clinton had refused to concede , demanding that he honor his own words and resign , she might have won in the end . 
  but that 's clinton . 
  she just does n't know how to fight like that . 
  that 's exactly what it will do . 
  the [ sixth party system , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixth_party_system ) which succeeded the [ fifth party system , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixth_party_system ) is dead . 
  the seventh has yet to appear . 
  america will eventually recover , but not as the one we knew . 
  this is our [ sixth party system . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixth_party_system ) it took over after the collapse of the [ fifth party system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifth_party_system ) in the 1960s , the [ fourth party system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourth_party_system ) in the great depression and the [ third party system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_party_system ) in the civil war . 
  the transition between party systems is always chaotic . 
  you think russian policy makers are worried about invasion ? 
  then how can you say they were forced to invade crimea ? 
   take the invasion of crimea for example . 
  this act was a reaction to the recent association agreement between the ukrain and the eu . 
  it was primarily about trade , though there was also a military part , which called for more military exercises with each other . 
  the media should have called them out for that and warned the public that this would tear the country appart , because it was going to force russia to secure geo-strategically important areas : crimea . 
  i 've heard this before , and i still do n't understand it . 
  you do n't like our militarism , and that 's fine , but at the same time , you believe that russia has a right to destabilize , invade and annex other countries for its own purposes . 
  where did russia get its license to aggress ? 
  all will be well , probably . 
  it did . 
  [ it was blair who pushed clinton into kosovo , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tony_blair#military_intervention_and_the_war_on_terror ) and he would have done more intervention if iraq had gone better . 
  people tend to forget about his `` new imperialism '' ideas . 
  latin americans have a tendency to blame us whenever they do something stupid . 
  i do n't think any president would give them another opportunity . 
  is that the leftist narrative this decade ? 
  i thought we were evil because we 're always trying to [ export democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empire_of_liberty ) abroad . 
  this event happened in 2014 . 
  and i do n't think any potential president wants another war . 
  we probably would have invaded iraq anyway , considering the 1990s and the promises that had been made to the kurds . 
  and blair certainly would have wanted to . 
  er , no , we would n't . 
  you think obama wants another war , in latin america ? 
  not european , but our occasional realignents . 
  [ third party system  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_party_system ) reconstruction [ fourth party system  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourth_party_system ) progressive era [ fifth party system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifth_party_system ) new deal [ sixth party system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixth_party_system ) civil rights movement seventh : donald incident , reptilian civil war ? 
  it 's a mistake to demonize anyone , but that 's quite a surprising statement from [ the guardian . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar ), 
  why are australians on the internet always like this ? 
  you 'd think we invaded you at some point . 
  no , americans in general are n't such colossal bigots . 
  on [ bbc world service polling , ] ( http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/country-rating-poll.pdf ) we actually give other nations ( germany , japan , the uk , canada , etc. ), 
  a more positive rating than we give the united states . 
  and all of those nations have a higher self-image than we do . 
  and we 're quite well aware of the fact that they tend to look down on us and always have . 
   the low number of parties alone already is the problem . 
  even if the two at the moment were amazing candidates , inevitable at some point there will be situation where both candidates are horrible and then you are screwed if you do and screwed if you do n't . 
  but what you might not know is that this has happened for us before . 
  what you 're seeing is the end of the [ sixth party system , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixth_party_system ) which took over from the [ fifth party system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifth_party_system ) and will soon give way to the seventh . 
  america 's parties are broad coalitions . 
  every few generations , changing demographics cause the party system to break down and a realignment occurs , inaugurating some major change in a new direction : * sixth party system : began with civil rights act * fifth party system : began with new deal * fourth party system : began with progressive era reforms * third party system : began with lincoln i tend to think of it as the doctor regenerating , or maybe a pokemon evolution . 
  our political culture is the result of 400 years of constitutional democracy , so maybe it 's best not to use the soviet union as a model to predict its future . 
  when people allow politics to take over their life to such an extent , i always suspect that it 's because it 's filling a void left by something else . 
  maybe she 's just bored . 
   i think europeans should cherish their individual cultures . 
  you do n't want everything to look so dull like here . 
  in fact , many people think all ` white ' people do n't have any culture at all because of what they see in the us . 
  i do n't think many foreigners would describe american culture as boring . 
  it 's just not that varied , which is the point . 
  we 're not supposed to do multiculturalism . 
  the whole point of the united states is creating [ one from many . 
  [ since you mention it ... ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7 ), 
  but britain is n't an authoritarian or totalitarian state , so the pattern ca n't be that simple . 
  i assume at least half of them are paid trolls . 
  really , so where are the others going ? 
  really ? 
  375 applications more than usual have been filed . 
  out of 300,000 british jews . 
  99.9 % of british jews are staying british , and you 're asking why it 's propaganda for the guardian to frame it as , `` for * many people , * the shock of the brexit vote on 23 june was enough to sweep away generations of hostility ? '', 
  not to mention : * they begin the article with the deceptive phrase `` descendants of the * tens of thousands , '' * allowing the reader to form a mistaken impression at the very beginning . 
  * they frame the tiny number of those leaving as `` a twentyfold increase . '', 
  * they never once inform the reader exactly how many british jews there are , and how many are * not * leaving . 
  * the overall theme of `` thanks to brexit , now * we 're * the nazis ! '', 
  which they repeat [ daily . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/31/refugees-problem-europe-identity-crisis-migration ) * everything else i 've neglected to mention . 
  but it is propaganda , and not genuine concern . 
  just look at [ this article ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/30/uk-descendants-of-jewish-refugees-seek-german-citizenship-after-brexit-vote ) about jews leaving the uk for germany . 
  a total of 375 jews are leaving . 
  that 's effectively 1 out of 1000 jews in britain . 
  the other 999 are choosing to stay . 
  the guardian hypes the 1 who is leaving , calling it `` a twentyfold increase , '' `` the descendants of tens of thousands , '' etc. 
  jews fleeing britain !, 
  this is genuine concern ? 
  it 's straight-up propaganda and it never stops . 
  i 'm not british , and i find the guardian 's endless propaganda tiresome as well . 
  it 's just publishing the same thing day after day , week after week : `` rumor has it , companies may leave the uk . '', 
  we 've heard it . 
  we 're tired of hearing it , and it 's not even relevant . 
  no one ever pretended the guardian was an objective news source . 
  their bias [ used to be funny , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry-wbbkdqjg ) but now it actually seems quite toxic , like they want to sabotage may 's attempts to steer the uk through this crisis . 
  i think it should just be banned from this sub , since it 's never going to have anything constructive to say . 
  no , i think that 's fairly normal , actually .
