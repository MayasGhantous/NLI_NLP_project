  despite what you 're saying , not all nationalism is ethnic nationalism , even if all germans are convinced that it is . 
  and i obviously do n't care how many downvotes i get for saying that . 
   i 've got a definition from a german textbook for you : `` contrary to national consciousness and patriotism [ ... ] , nationalism glorifies the own nation and puts other nations down . '', 
  that 's amazing . 
   * in germany * there 's an overwhelming consensus that `` nationalism '' means ethnic nationalism in its bad form . 
  from a german point of view , `` civic nationalism '' is a contradiction in itself . 
  yeah , i know that ; it was the point of my original comment . 
  but it 's not actually true , is it ? 
  every nation in the new world is officially a civic nation . 
  every form of nationalism is n't ethnic nationalism . 
  in the us , ethnic nationalism and civic nationalism have often been opposed , as in the civil war and the fight over immigration and equal rights . 
  in my humble opinion , it 's a problem if people ca n't differentiate between them . 
   patriotism . 
  patriotism is the emotional attachment to your state . 
  that does n't have to mean that you think your nation is objectively superior . 
  a patriot is just someone who loves their country or people . 
  someone who believes fanatically in the superiority of their nation , i would just call them fanatics . 
  nationalism is a group of related political theories ; their meaning is n't decided by popular consensus . 
  and in fact , [ american nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_nationalism ) is largely based on the same [ civic nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) as the french republic . 
  because political science interests me and i happen to be right . 
  i think the more interesting question is why every truthful statement about nationalism gets heavily downvoted . 
   it was nationalism in 1848/49 and the following years , but the german reunification had nothing to do with nationalist feelings . 
  there 's no more obvious example of nationalist feeling than saying , `` let 's be one nation , '' and having celebrations of national unity . 
  regardless of the bad reputation the word * nationalism * has in germany , that is nationalism . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/types_of_nationalism nationalism is basically an endorsement of the modern concept that a nation should have a state , i.e. 
  a [ nation-state . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation_state ) the belief that all historic german states should be united as one nation is nationalism . 
  in the 19th century , [ pan-german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan-germanism ) nationalism led to the political unification of germany . 
  reunification in the 20th century might be better described as civic or cultural nationalism , but it 's still nationalism . 
  gosh , and here i was thinking your condescending attitude of superiority in condemning my `` sheer ignorance '' made you sound like a massive twat . 
  all i did was state a simple fact . 
  it is nationalism . 
  if you 've agreed with that all along , then your comments have been pointless . 
  look it up . 
  -_- i 'm not going to apologize for knowing what nationalism is . 
  the word is accurate . 
  it 's the connotation that is wrong , and the result of popular ignorance . 
  if that 's true , it 's because they themselves are dumb . 
  the word * nationalism * is demonized in europe the same way the word * socialism * is in the us . 
  most think it 's a bad thing , but few actually know what it is . 
   when people say that they 're against `` nationalism '' , they are against the most extreme nuances of that concept then they need to be more specific and say they 're against [ ethnic nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_nationalism ) but in favor of [ civic nationalism , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) because treating the word * nationalism * as meaning only one type of nationalism is a stumbling block to having meaningful discussions . 
  there are indeed many forms of nationalism , but believing that all historic german states should be united as one nation is obviously nationalism under one form of another . 
  i 'm not suggesting any such thing . 
  i 'm just saying that endorsing german unification makes you a nationalist , whether you 're aware of that or not . 
  i 'm not some right-winger . 
  it 's just that the word * nationalism * actually has a definition , and this is it . 
  it 's still nationalism . 
  cultural or [ civic nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) is as nationalist as [ ethnic nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_nationalism ) or any other form of nationalism . 
  you 're just proving the point . 
  i do n't think you know what nationalism actually is . 
  what do you mean `` no '' ? 
  german unification is literally nationalism . 
  there 's no clearer example of nationalism . 
  i wonder how many who approve of german unification are aware that they are nationalists . 
  edit : not that i believe there 's anything wrong with nationalism . 
  but a lot of germans supposedly think there is . 
  2nd edit : [ _ read a book . _ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/types_of_nationalism ), 
  that 's too bad . 
  ambition is the characteristic of a great nation . 
  how do you know what they voted for ? 
  i think that , even in britain , there is some confusion about this . 
  but what i said was about british conservatives , and specifically theresa may and boris johnson , and they do actually want this . 
  and the imperial federation is n't actually imperialism anyway . 
  the whole point of it is that it 's democratic . 
   as a canadian , i really do n't see any benefit to the union . 
  population ? 
  military strength ? 
  a future as a great power ? 
   yes , the british empire was a real pillar of western values !, 
  / s the concept of the social contract was invented in britain . 
  the values of the british empire are a significant part of what we call western today . 
  it also got upvoted to +56 on that sub , whereas here it 's at ... 0 . 
  well , but one union is with germans and italians , and the other is with the british empire . 
  canzuk is just a more exclusive version of the [ imperial federation . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperial_federation ) i 'd guess that the reason churchill restricted his vision to the white dominions of canada , australia and new zealand might have had something to do with his personal opinions ( `` i hate indians - a beastly people . 
  '' ) , but politicians who advocate it today probably envision the possibility of further expansion in the same way that the eu has expanded . 
  whether you agree with it or not , it 's nice to know that we live in a world in which big ideas are still possible . 
   they not only voted for , but actually pushed for eastern expansion . 
   they wrote the damn thing . 
  who are `` they ? '', 
  british people may have done that , but i think you 'll find that the conservative side of british politics has never really been sold on the idea of becoming european . 
  boris johnson and theresa may [ are both admirers of joseph chamberlain , ] ( http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439080/theresa-may-britains-conservative-prime-minister-tough-mysterious ) the architect of the [ imperial federation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperial_federation ) project , which the british right has always dreamed of reviving since ww2 . 
  they may have went along with europe , but if they had a choice , they would always have chosen this . 
   the bastards lied to us . 
  their public face is filled by these well spoken , intelligent , sophisticated types and they love to sell them selves as the cultured old world brother to those silly , stupid americans , but the more you actually look , the more you realize that if anything , they 're worse . 
  i would n't go that far . 
  successful politicians tend to possess a degree of moral flexibility . 
  seven years after that speech , the fourteenth amendment ( guaranteeing equal rights regardless of race ) and the fifteenth amendment ( guaranteeing the right to vote regardless of race ) were passed . 
  at that time , the ethnic nationalists were those who wanted to keep slavery intact in the south and to restrict citizenship to whites . 
  * civic * nationalists wanted the opposite . 
  civic nationalism made america a better country . 
  i 'm pointing this out because you said civic nationalism does n't build history , but it obviously has built a lot of american history . 
   nationalism is about putting yourself and seeing yourself as part of some great historic project . 
  exactly right . 
   civic nationalism does not build history . 
  on this point , i beg to disagree :  now , it happens that we meet together once every year , sometime about the 4th of july , for some reason or other . 
  these 4th of july gatherings i suppose have their uses . 
  if you will indulge me , i will state what i suppose to be some of them . 
   we are now a mighty nation , we are thirty -- or about thirty millions of people , and we own and inhabit about one-fifteenth part of the dry land of the whole earth . 
  we run our memory back over the pages of history for about eighty-two years and we discover that we were then a very small people in point of numbers , vastly inferior to what we are now , with a vastly less extent of country , -- with vastly less of everything we deem desirable among men , -- we look upon the change as exceedingly advantageous to us and to our posterity , and we fix upon something that happened away back , as in some way or other being connected with this rise of prosperity .
