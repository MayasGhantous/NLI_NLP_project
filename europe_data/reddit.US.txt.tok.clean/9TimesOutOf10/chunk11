  we find a race of men living in that day whom we claim as our fathers and grandfathers ; they were iron men , they fought for the principle that they were contending for ; and we understood that by what they then did it has followed that the degree of prosperity that we now enjoy has come to us . 
  we hold this annual celebration to remind ourselves of all the good done in this process of time of how it was done and who did it , and how we are historically connected with it ; and we go from these meetings in better humor with ourselves -- we feel more attached the one to the other , and more firmly bound to the country we inhabit . 
  in every way we are better men in the age , and race , and country in which we live for these celebrations . 
  but after we have done all this we have not yet reached the whole . 
  there is something else connected with it . 
  we have besides these men -- descended by blood from our ancestors -- among us perhaps half our people who are not descendants at all of these men , they are men who have come from europe -- german , irish , french and scandinavian -- men that have come from europe themselves , or whose ancestors have come hither and settled here , finding themselves our equals in all things . 
  if they look back through this history to trace their connection with those days by blood , they find they have none , they can not carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us , but when they look through that old declaration of independence they find that those old men say that `` we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , '' and then they feel that that moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men , that it is the father of all moral principle in them , and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood , and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that declaration , [ loud and long continued applause ] and so they are . 
  that is the electric cord in that declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together , that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world . 
  dezinformatsiya , the gift that keeps giving . 
  our population increased 300 % in the 20th century alone , mostly from immigration . 
  even more in the 19th century . 
  still today , 50 % of california 's population are foreign-born . 
  that 's what much of the us looked like for much of history . 
  all the nations in north and south america are [ civic nations . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) it 's been our official ideology for hundreds of years . 
   i would * personally * argue that europe is already a ( semi-loose ) nation , just one that ca n't bring itself to admit that yet in any politically meaningful setting , but on the other hand you could find enough contrasts to argue the contrary , as many eurosceptics do . 
  the idea of having a single nation actually scares many people , but i think it 's because there has n't been enough focus ( also academically ) on how related we actually are this has basically been my impression . 
  it 's admittedly a big step . 
   this also means that , culturally , a `` united states of europe '' is an impossibility if you consider it a knock-off of the usa . 
  well , there 's no need to reach for that rainbow . 
  you 're not the first nation to be created from a union of separate nations , you know . 
  india , russia , china , germany , spain , uk , malaysia - all likely more useful case studies for european federalists than any mere colony . 
  and even among colonies , canada might be a better example because of the french/english multiculturalism . 
  but in every one of those cases so far , some [ higher-level nationalism ] ( http://www.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/10/2015/02/07980860.jpg ) has been the glue that has held them together . 
  what exactly is the alternative to nationalism ? 
  is n't that merely another form of nationalism , asserting that europeans are a nation ? 
  it 's good that you added that disclaimer , but i do n't think ethnic nationalism is the only kind of nationalism that can be discussed . 
  i think the problem with nationalism in the us is that it 's declining . 
  american nationalism is based on liberal principles , but there are so many of us so ignorant of what those principles are that we might be voting for a man who espouses exactly the opposite this year . 
  trump 's voters do n't know what made america great . 
  meaning they do n't know what 's great about it . 
  that 's how little they understand our nationalism . 
  meanwhile , it 's clear that clinton is a nationalist and a patriot . 
  she 's criticized for being an interventionist , but she 's an interventionist because she firmly believes in what has been [ a key theme of american foreign policy since 1780 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empire_of_liberty ) and she might lose , because democratic voters do n't . 
  if you believe polls , only 49 % of democratic voters think the us should defend its allies if they 're attacked . 
  and i 'm guessing most would agree with your comment . 
  technically speaking , [ patriotism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patriotism ) is an emotional attachment to one 's nation . 
  [ nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalism ) can mean that , but it also refers to the political ideology that defines the nation . 
  historically , americans have indeed been highly nationalist . 
  [ american nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_nationalism ) is officially [ civic nationalism , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) which defines the nation by individualist principles rather than shared ethnicity . 
  so the decline of our traditional nationalism has , i think , contributed to the rise of [ ethnic nationalists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_nationalism ) like donald trump , who oppose equal rights , immigration , free trade and much of what supposedly defines us as a nation . 
  the point i 'm making is about human sentiment . 
  humans are tribalistic . 
  nationalism is just the modern expression of our basic need to belong to a greater social unit . 
  that need has to be satisfied , one way or another . 
  nationalism does n't have to be xenophobic . 
  it can be purely civic nationalism that defines the eu as a nation , which was the original goal of federalists . 
  but there has to be a nation , because that 's the organizing principle people fall back on when they need to . 
  so if the only people offering that are the far right , that 's who will win . 
  because people actually need nationalism , and the left , in all countries , has forgotten this . 
  mexico 's idealistic constitution mandates neutrality and pacifism , even preventing participation in un peacekeeping activities . 
  there have been attempts recently to change that . 
  it 's the world 's loss that a democratic nation the size and gdp of russia barely exists as far as international politics is concerned . 
  whether you 're talking about population centers or military bases , [ most of ours are n't far from the ocean ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-glmgzuc6z9u/v1e9u7l4bsi/aaaaaaaamo0/ywizdbr_42qkorucn6p7xdpd2mzwwkwxaclcb/s640/mil_install_map_sm.gif ) and the edge of our airspace . 
  it would be so much easier for russia to destroy us than for us to destroy russia . 
  not that either will ever happen . 
  i did n't claim to be innocent . 
  i just meant that russia already has us encircled with missiles from the arctic to texas ; putin can obliterate us any time he wants , and is obviously not worried about our missile bases and military exercises . 
  and it 's not quite the same , our subs and their subs . 
  russia 's a vast country and its cities are mostly far inland . 
  our cities are mostly on our coasts , 22 kilometers from international waters . 
  in terms of vulnerability , the current situation is as if we were flying nuclear bombers over the moscow suburbs . 
   not being able to initially defend the baltics is n't exactly a secret . 
  an offensive war would probably go even worse for nato . 
  russia has always had a superior land army , quantitatively and ( in some ways ) qualitatively . 
  as a bellwether , some voices at the pentagon expect american armored divisions to be [ `` annihilated '' ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/inside-the-pentagons-fight-over-russia-us-eastern-europe/ ) by russian armored divisions . 
  and with its limited funds , russia has been specializing in anti-aircraft missiles and area denial , which will turn any conventional war into a long , grinding war of attrition , the kind of war russia usually wins . 
  maybe the best way to answer that question is to point out that russia has nuclear missile submarines a few kilometers from america 's cities and is flying nuclear bombers in the gulf of mexico . 
  yet you do n't hear us complaining , because we 're not looking for excuses to annex someone . 
  edit : also , [ we ca n't even defeat russia in our own simulations . 
  ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/18/exclusive-the-pentagon-is-preparing-new-war-plans-for-a-baltic-battle-against-russia/ ), 
  i gave you your source . 
  i 'm not going to argue about it . 
  because `` every nation for itself '' is a shitty kind of world order . 
  because peace is good . 
  because liberalism lifts mankind out of poverty . 
  i thought we had established these things . 
   i want to see a genuine source for this . 
  nobody in the know truly believes we would lose a war with china . 
  http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/rr1140.html china does n't need a blue-water navy to cross the taiwan straits , and the navy they have is very much built for that purpose . 
   none of kim 's threats are credible . 
  really ? 
  no , i can imagine it . 
  it 's not as if that does n't happen already . 
  the us is already a federation , with some states that execute more prisoners than iran , and others in which capital punishment has been illegal for 150 years . 
  venezuela would just be another problem state for the rest to deal with . 
  but overall , the nations on our side of the ocean are all constitutional republics , with a common ( mostly peaceful ) history and really only three languages . 
  i 'd welcome a political union . 
  edit : as for [ anglosphere , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglosphere ) that 's another superstate we might try for , with the uk and canada and other members of the empire . 
  also called the [ imperial federation . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperial_federation ) or federal commonwealth . 
  either union would be fine with me . 
  afghanistan was a defensive war . 
  the taliban regime were outright terrorists who provided a home base to al qaeda for exporting terrorism around the world , including the 9/11 attacks , and they were already fighting the northern alliance , which was supported by iran , russia , turkey , india , tajikistan and other nations , in a war of attrition . 
  nato intervened on the side of the international community to destroy the taliban and help afghanistan transition to democracy . 
  it just completed its first democratic transfer of power in its modern history . 
  the un has a mission there . 
  i 'm sure ireland 's assistance in fighting the remaining pockets of taliban control would be welcomed by its current democratic government . 
  i 'm totally in favor of that , or a united anglosphere .
