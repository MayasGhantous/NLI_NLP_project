  our parties are large coalitions , each of which contain many factions that would simply be parties in your system . 
  the taliban terrorist network was founded by the pakistani intelligence service . 
  and the us did n't create isis , unless you mean the way batman created the joker . 
  i think there 's a more charitable way you could have read / u/aullik 's comment . 
  haha , this thread went bad fast . 
  i thought someone would probably reply to your comment the wrong way , but i told myself it would n't happen . 
   we matured into democracy , something you guys still have before you . 
   we stopped waging war for no reason . 
  you did n't !, 
  and this is what we hate about europeans . 
  no doubt you * believe * you 're fully justified in judging yourselves culturally , politically and morally superior to us , but you were equally convinced of all of that in the 1930s , and the 1860s , and the 1700s and the 1600s . 
  it never changes . 
  you 're always the most enlightened people in the world , whatever your beliefs are in this decade . 
  yes , i 'm aware that we have some of this tendency ourselves . 
  we 're both shouting at the mirror . 
  singapore 's last ambassador called the european/american relationship mutual love-hate , which is n't really fair on our part . 
  the fact is that we 're not the center of our civilization , and the distance between us is a lot smaller than it used to be . 
   they do n't care about the victims . 
  when you say something like that , you 're in danger of losing your objectivity . 
   he hopes a unified army will serve not as an aggressive army , but one that protects europe ** and democracy around the globe . 
  ** does that mean keeping china out of taiwan , iran out of iraq , north korea out of south korea , etc. 
   mexico lost wars and a lot of land and legitimacy to , among others , you guys . 
  that was during the reign of napoleon iii . 
   how does the melanin content of their skin play into this ? 
  do n't be facetious . 
  if you want a clear example of this , just compare the us to canada . 
  black and hispanic canadians have the same issues as black and hispanic americans - they 're actually slightly more over-represented in prison , similar education statistics , etc. 
  but only 2.9 % of canadians are black , and 0.2 % are hispanic , so it does n't affect their overall statistics as much . 
  in some ways it 's true that our history has been `` easy mode '' , but in other ways not . 
  large size and complexity is n't a guarantee of * social * success . 
  it might be more of a detriment . 
  that 's true , but if a state referendum passed with a clear majority in favor of secession , i 'm certain that the country would allow it , even if that required a constitutional amendment . 
  to do otherwise would make us total hypocrites . 
  i also doubt that the current supreme court would rule against them . 
  if a state actually wanted to secede , of course it would be allowed to . 
  this is n't 1860 - and even in 1860 it was controversial . 
  if the southern states had ceded peacefully and democratically instead of enslaving half their people and attacking the union , there would n't have been a civil war . 
  congratulations on being a free thinker . 
  i 'm not sure it 's superior , but there are certainly benefits . 
  most people would just assume uncritically that their own system is the best . 
  that 's true , but if a state wanted to secede from the union , it would probably hold a referendum to decide it . 
  * ethnic homogeneity , in particular having much whiter populations . 
  * filthy rich in natural resources ( norway produces more oil than the united states , with 1/60 the population . ), 
  * also untouched by world wars ( sweden has n't been at war for 200 years ) . 
  most of your observations also apply to other countries in our hemisphere , e.g. 
  mexico , brazil . 
  success in per-capita terms is probably easier for a small country than for a large one . 
  no , what 's stupid is saying that country * x * has a more successful `` model '' than * y * because they have less poor people . 
  in fact * x 's * approach might be significantly worse , but it could still produce better results because it 's given more favorable circumstances . 
   was a pisa science performance graph really the best example you could find ? 
  science test scores are a good example of a common standard that can be applied to different countries , unlike crime , unemployment , median income and other things that affect some countries more than others for historical reasons beyond their control ; or things like happiness and health , which are affected by cultural and other factors . 
   not counting tourists , i think iceland must be close to 99 % white caucasian . 
  one of many reasons why such comparisons are kinda stupid . 
   the nordics cluster at the top of league tables of everything from economic competitiveness to social health to happiness . 
  [ that 's simply not true . 
  ] ( https://data.oecd.org/pisa/science-performance-pisa.htm#indicator-chart )  they have avoided both southern europe 's economic sclerosis and america 's extreme inequality . 
  no , they just do n't talk about it . 
  their governments do n't collect any relevant data , on racial equality for example , and their media self-censors . 
  but whenever someone does look into it , [ what they find ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yvl05/til_according_to_a_book_published_in_2014_the_son/ ) is never that flattering . 
  i think it 's a basic mistake to treat `` populism '' on one continent as the same ideology as populism on another . 
  for sure , there are points of agreement between populists - because they 're partly reacting to similar events - but they 're products of different political cultures . 
  and even in the same culture , there are different kinds of populism . 
  bernie sanders and donald trump are both populists . 
  so is populism right-wing or left-wing , socially liberal or illiberal ? 
  too soon . 
  taiwan is democratic and has 3x china 's per capita gdp . 
  we 've been doing this in the states since the early 2000s with similar results . 
  homelessness has dropped 25 % over the last 7 years alone : http://www.citylab.com/housing/2016/11/homelessness-obama-trump/508223/, 
  brussels has a war room ? 
   there have been reports that china has asked for the date of the next eu-china summit to be brought forward to send a clear political message to the united states that the european union and china stand united against protectionism . 
   the us has the highest poverty rate , greatest income inequality , lowest social mobility , worst score on the un 's gender inequality index , the highest expenditure on health care as a percentage of gdp , yet all this money accompanied by the highest infant mortality rate , the highest prevalence of mental health problems , the highest obesity rate , the highest percentage of people going without health care due to cost , the highest consumption of antidepressants per capita , and the shortest life expectancy at birth , the highest homicide rate , the largest prison population in absolute terms and per capita , the lowest score on yale 's environmental performance index and the largest ecological footprint per capita , the 3rd lowest spending on international development and humanitarian assistance as a percentage of national income , the highest military spending both in total and as a percentage of gdp and the largest international arms sales . 
  most of the that simply is n't true . 
  for example , we actually have a higher survival rate for premature infants than denmark [ ( source : cdc ) . 
  ] ( https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db23.htm ) that super-high infant mortality statistic is because we use a much broader definition of the term . 
   china is a developing country . 
  it is n't possible for it to stop growing emissions while also developing as technology exists today . 
  the point is that it actually gives a damn , it could easily be like america and refuse to even discuss climate change , much less invest in renewable energy which will help the entire world . 
  china also objected to a joint statement on climate change , same as the us . 
  so did india . 
  you do n't know that because you allow yourself to be manipulated and neglect to notice things like this :  reuters reported there had been opposition from the us , saudi arabia ** and other countries ** here 's another headline for you : https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/07/solar-power-growth-worldwide-us-china-uk-europe it also might be worth comparing the us to australia on this table : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita, 
  to be fair , wanting higher military spending while still wanting our ( rich and powerful ) allies to rely on us less is n't actually contradictory . 
  on the second part , at least , he 's just saying more crudely what obama was saying for the last eight years . 
   what 's the point of even showing up under the electoral college system ? 
  around 40 of the states are essentially decided years before the campaigns even get underway . 
  for one thing , there are elections for offices other than president ? 
  people who do n't vote in november do n't vote for anything , from town council up . 
  you ca n't use that argument in a democracy . 
  but backseat criticism from micronations is pretty immature . 
  so why does n't the title say `` us , china and india '' ? 
   reuters reported there had been opposition from the us , saudi arabia and other countries i guess they do n't think it 's worth reporting which other g20 countries opposed it . 
  well , it 's definitely up there . 
  a distant relative of [ traditional murican dress . 
  first they came for the pineapples , and i said nothing because i was not a pineapple . 
  it 's one of the measurements used by that ranking system , along with women in ministerial positions , life expectancy and other things that tell you nothing about actual gender equality . 
  this ca n't be true . 
  [ sweden is one of the top countries for gender equality . 
  ] ( http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2015/rankings/ ) or i mean , maybe `` years with female head of state '' does n't actually mean anything . 
  i was thinking of miller / burton . 
  q : let 's face it : you 're not exactly a * normal * country , are you ? 
  a : it 's not exactly a normal world , is it ?
