  he also tends to create as many monsters as he puts away . 
  by day , an eccentric billionaire playboy , spoiled , selfish and vain . 
  by night , he dons a black cape and a lot of high-tech equipment and goes out into the city to bring justice to criminals , or work out his personal issues , or something . 
  if it makes you feel better , i have 2400 comment karma on this sub . 
  i 'd suggest worrying less about how you look . 
   your perspective is skewed , as you look at the us as normal sized , i think . 
  size is relative , is n't it ? 
  for the purpose of this comparison , i 'm considering anything less than 5 % of our population a micronation . 
  you 're illustrating my point : how much educational infrastructure do you need for a population of 300,000 ? 
  how much infrastructure of any kind ? 
  how many industries ? 
  how many ethnic groups ? 
  how can you compare anything when your largest city has a population of 100,000 ? 
  that 's 7 % the population of phoenix , arizona . 
  both iceland and the us may be described with one word , `` country , '' but in other ways they 're such different things that comparisons are almost pointless . 
   the us will require some massive changes for them to ever do universally good on per-capita rankings , even when correcting for micronations . 
  it will probably never be `` universally '' good compared to smaller countries , but it can be competitive : https://data.oecd.org/pisa/science-performance-pisa.htm#indicator-chart, 
   i find it weird that this is suddenly a problem  why only pay attention to this now when did i say it was n't a problem before ? 
  you 're projecting a lot onto me . 
   that must be nice for you to have lived a life that enables you to think such things . 
  everyone was not so fortunate . 
  omfg , you have no idea . 
  i know from my own experiences how crippling low expectations are . 
  telling a kid he 's `` locked out '' of the american dream is a perfect way to ruin his chances in life . 
  there 's nothing disingenuous about it . 
  of course the inequality of the present has much to do with the racism of the past . 
  but racism is no more prevalent in chicago than in other cities , and the murder rate is higher . 
  there 's a lot more going on . 
  and no one really knows yet what 's behind the recent murder epidemic , but i highly doubt a sharp increase in racism has occurred . 
  and i do n't accept that anyone is `` locked out '' of the american dream . 
  excuses like that become self-fulfilling prophecies . 
  the vast majority of those deaths are gang-related . 
  there are many reasons for it ; blaming racism is an easy reaction that gets us nowhere . 
  and crime has been going down nationally for years , but has spiked in chicago ; 2016 was its worst year in decades , in defiance of national trends . 
  now you 've done it . 
   apart from the afd , everyone has the same opinion on * one question . 
  * * one question * that amounts to approval or disapproval on a wide range of topics and actions . 
  why are you guys so sensitive about this ? 
  in the same comment , i said american media was lying crap . 
  ca n't you take a little social criticism ? 
  this is my opinion of german media after living in germany for years and being exposed to german opinions . 
  any grownup should be able to admit that german media is simply more `` politically correct '' than american media . 
  i did n't say there was a conspiracy - i just said it tends to be very one-sided . 
  if you have to make shit up , what 's the point of arguing ? 
  yes . 
  it might be a correct opinion , but correct or not , everyone has the same opinion , and that 's my point . 
  sure , but look at the graph . 
  except for afd , everyone has the same opinion . 
  german media is crap from an informational standpoint . 
  i used to think ours was bad , and i mean , it is , but where our media lies or is complacent about repeating lies , german media tells the truth in a relentlessly one-sided way that leaves no room for dissent . 
  i can understand the appeal of the phrase * alternative f\u00fcr deutschland . 
  man , come on . 
  that 's not * at all * clear to anyone watching him . 
  what 's clear is that he said something happened in sweden . 
  he fucked up . 
  * maybe * he meant to say `` i watched tucker carlson talking about sweden last night , '' but what he actually said was something false , and the only one debating it is you . 
  i 'm not evading anything . 
  there are multiple opposition parties in the singapore parliament . 
  singapore is a democracy . 
  you do n't seem to understand the situation . 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1no5dwrqz4  watch this omg that 's infuriating . 
  so many lies told so flippantly . 
  ffs , most of saddam hussein 's chemical weapons were provided [ by germany .

  [ the government we supported in iran freed millions of iranians from slavery . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_revolution#reforms ) it was far better than the government they have now . 
  it 's 5 million people . 
  i do n't see what finland has to do with it . 
  and japan has been governed by the same party since 1955 , except for five years , and it 's still a democracy . 
  as long as they can vote for opposition parties , i think my statement holds true . 
  as you say , they could n't do that 20 years ago . 
  in china , though , the communist party is firmly embedded in the constitution , which is why i say they wo n't survive without a revolution of some kind , peaceful or otherwise . 
  by having 10x the population . 
  singapore is also a democracy . 
  and the rules for city-states are a little different , i think . 
  you ca n't really have an advanced economy without democracy , though . 
  high-paying jobs require education , and education makes people want political freedom . 
  the prc wo n't survive the transition without a revolution of some kind . 
  and adults who watch crap documentaries by oliver stone . 
  al-maliki and most of his party were living in iran during their exile from iraq . 
  [ they still receive direct funding from the islamic republic today .

   not saying pakistan did not help the taliban , but they merely traded and left them alone , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taliban#role_of_the_pakistani_military, 
   not saying some of that is n't true but we did kinda dig that hole for ourselves with the whole toppling iran 's democratic government to prop up a dictatorship thing . 
  that 's the islamic republic 's anti-western propaganda . 
  mossadegh was a dictator and it was the iranian military who got rid of him . 
  we only provided emergency financial support afterward . 
  and the ayatollah was on the same side as us back then , and rewrote history later to suit their purposes . 
  thank you . 
  i mean , korea ? 
  this is a list of un peacekeeping activities .

   american interventions in south america alone are far worse than anything iran has ever done [ and yet south americans still prefer us as allies ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5uoxhe/nations_most_preferred_ally_in_case_of_military/ ) you guys need to get some perspective . 
  you 're allied with us for a reason . 
  even vietnam prefers us to anyone else . 
  it 's a red herring .
