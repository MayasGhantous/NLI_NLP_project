  sorry but you deserved that . 
  and cool conspiracy theory , but [ here 's ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp79t00826a001800010075-4 ) the cia situation report from the morning after the '67 coup and [ here 's ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/0005973764 ) the president 's daily intelligence brief . 
  they did n't even know who the leaders were . 
   you know it 's the same thing just under another name right ? 
  well , if you read the situation report above , the junta promised a return to parliamentary rule . 
  and it was your government . 
  what should we have done ? 
  i 'm just guessing , but the ones at the top of the image ? 
  that was later on in the 1960s , and it was n't really us . 
  the recently declassified cia archive shows that the white house was n't responsible for the coup , as they were busy for a while trying to find out who was responsible : * [ situation report ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp79t00826a001800010075-4 ) * [ president 's daily intelligence briefing ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/0005973764 ) there were some collaborators among the cia officers in greece , though . 
  the world was at war back then , and communism meant death . 
  and as you pointed out , the ussr was funding your communists . 
  what 's noble about letting an ally fall to a stealth invasion ? 
  it was the right decision . 
  they both had military coups during the cold war . 
  we might have helped . 
  a little . 
  because all the other choices are worse . \u2122, 
  no you 're not . 
  the us and eu together represent 60 % of global gdp . 
   absolutely . 
  but we learning the language also makes you more prone to get cultural influence from europe . 
  so ... that 's why i said `` until everyone in europe speaks it . '', 
  there are still more english speakers on our side of the ocean . 
  eventually , if english replaces your existing languages , the center of gravity will shift back to europe , but probably not before then . 
  that 's a stereotype , not reality . 
  the truth is that * per capita * statistics simply favor countries with less * capita . 
  * the top countries on any per capita list are always micronations , whether it 's education ( singapore ) , wealth ( luxembourg ) , oil production ( qatar , norway ) , nobel laureates ( israel ) , olympic medals ( bahamas ) , etc. 
  yeah , i remember that with katrina . 
  it 's surprising how much effect these things have on public perception . 
  not for their own general public . 
  english proficiency is still under 50 % in most countries . 
   arguing that development and humanitarian aid could also count as security . 
  and military forces are perfect for that too .

  `` there were many people who argued against it '' can be said about any commonly accepted thing in every era . 
  it does n't change what i said . 
  although you 're right about belgian congo - there was an international outcry even at the time . 
  belgium was sanctioned over it iirc . 
  if you do n't speak hindi or mandarin or any european language except your native one and english , there 's not much alternative . 
  yes . 
  but i mean , they consume our crap because there is n't any alternative , and i can easily understand how frustrating that is . 
  anti-americanism is mostly just venting that frustration , so it does n't bother me . 
  but yeah , multipolarity ca n't happen soon enough . 
  i 'm so ready for us to be a colony again instead of the center of the fucking universe . 
  you can certainly be prosperous while divided , but powerful ? 
  and i do n't know why my comment was downvoted . 
  it seems pretty obvious to me that you ca n't be a functioning superpower without a common language . 
  i think 200 years ago , rape , pillage and murder were commonplace , if not universal , practices in european wars . 
  even in ww1 , reprisals against civilians were common . 
  and in other parts of the world ( since we 're talking about colonialism ) , the rules were actually different . 
  in north america , genocide , slavery and mass murder were fully accepted practices in native culture . 
  when a tribe went to war , the objective was to wipe out its enemy , scalp every male and rape every female . 
  and the colonies themselves adopted some of the same practices , even offering bounties for enemy scalps . 
  in 1697 , hannah dustin , captured by the abenaki , scalped 10 of her captors in the process of escaping , and when she returned to the colony , the massachusetts general assembly paid her for all 10 scalps - two men , two women , and six children . 
  i remember a quote from some colonist who said , during the massacre of a native village during [ king philip 's war , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_philip's_war ) `` it was a fearful thing to watch them fry , '' but in truth the enemy would have done the same to them , and did so - many colonial towns were wiped out the same way during that war . 
  so , a crime against humanity ? 
  no , at the time and place , it was just normal . 
  language . 
  you need a common one . 
  and the fact that europe has chosen english as its common language means we 'll be a strong influence until everyone in europe speaks it . 
   they called him a traitor , claimed that he was disrespecting france by making such comments abroad . 
  i agree . 
  there were no crimes against humanity back then - there were no agreed-upon international laws that would make it a crime . 
  and the french firmly believed in their `` civilizing mission . '', 
  judging past generations by the morals of the present is always unfair and disrespectful . 
  it 's also given us 220 years of stable democracy . 
  the electoral college ( and the senate ) exist to ensure that small states are n't dominated by larger states . 
  a pure democracy ends up like [ illinois , ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/illinois_governor_election_results_by_county,_2014.svg/2000px-illinois_governor_election_results_by_county,_2014.svg.png ) with one super-populous region making everything else irrelevant . 
  that might be technically democratic but it goes against the principle of self-government . 
  if our elections worked like that , we 'd probably have our own brexits in no time . 
  i 'm not insistent on keeping it , but there are pros and cons , and i do n't think any large democracy has succeeded in coming up with anything better . 
   sorry , it 's getting hard to tell these days . 
  so you should probably be less quick to form opinions . 
  as for our outdated electoral system , do you realize that in most european countries , you would n't even get to vote for your president ? 
  theresa may and angela merkel were n't elected at all , much less by popular vote . 
  if we had a system like that , trump probably would n't be president ( it would be mitt romney or some other mainstream republican ) , but i 'm sure it 's not what most americans want . 
   you 're a trump cultist , [ you 're closed-minded and judgmental . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5r7ifn/eurozone_economy_grows_at_faster_pace_than_us/dd5xgs4/ ), 
   trump lost the popular vote by 3 million people . 
  our outdated election system and decades of corrupt oligarchy elected him . 
  not true . 
  the establishment was firmly in favor of clinton . 
  and the electoral college exists for a reason and [ most americans do n't want to change it . 
  ] ( http://pollingreport.com/politics.htm ), 
  one of many ironies about trump is that he represents most of what the guardian has always wanted from american foreign policy , and suddenly [ it terrifies them . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/12/us-must-not-abandon-nato-europe-go-alone-jens-stoltenberg ), 
  per capita measurements tend to favor small countries . 
  i think it was the bahamas who got the most medals per capita last year - they got one medal . 
  if a large country does anything better than a small country per capita , it really is something to celebrate . 
  dick-waving seems to be your reason for being here : u/mightierthanthou . 
  i 'm embarrassed by your frequent dick-waving , yes . 
   the eu has almost 200 million more people than the us ( 509 million vs 324 million ) , yet the us has a larger gdp . 
  and ? 
  no one said anything about gdp . 
  you do n't have to boast about how `` mighty '' ` murica is at every single opportunity . 
   `` once more she 's throwing oil on the fire , '' socialist candidate benoit hamon said in a statement monday . 
  `` once more she 's creating disorder , she 's encouraging violence with her hate speech . '' poor hamon , he just does n't get it . 
  far from being offended , i 'm sure most ordinary people would applaud language like that against violent rioters .
