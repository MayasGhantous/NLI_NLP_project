  many happy returns . 
   france never withdrew from nato . 
  in fact , it provided boots for most nato deployments pre-2009 , and positively answered to us ' article 5 invocation following 9/11 . 
  http://adst.org/2014/06/france-has-degaulle-to-withdraw-from-nato/  also , to my knowledge , the us were not a belligerent in the war france fought in vietnam , and france was not a belligerent in the war the us fought there [ not exactly . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_dien_bien_phu ) the us became involved in the first indochina war because of our alliance with france . 
  ngo dinh diem , installed in paris , later started the second indochina war , in which we were a belligerent . 
   france makes mistakes too , indeed . 
  the key difference here is we are able to assess them afterwards and to understand where we failed . 
  the lybian policy is considered a significant failure of the sarkozy administration in france . 
  do you really think that 's a difference ? 
  the majority of americans also believe that the iraq war was a mistake , which was why we elected obama on a promise to disengage from iraq . 
  i 'm in a distinct minority in actually believing that the war was just and that retreat was a mistake . 
  and this is the annoying part : the way you remember these events . 
  france is n't a longstanding ally . 
  it left nato after dragging the us into vietnam , and only fully rejoined in 2009 . 
  the french republic proved in libya how much it cares about middle east stability . 
  after 13 years of not even trying to help and only making the situation worse , you now blame us for all of the region 's problems . 
  you did n't just disagree with us - you joined putin in using your unsc veto to obstruct our efforts . 
  then you sold out ukraine and georgia in order to appease putin again . 
  you were n't even a full member of nato at that time . 
  of course not .

  six months ago i said i was n't really worried about a trump presidency because he has no experience in government and his agenda is unpopular with both parties and so we 'd basically just be without a president for four years , but i was n't considering the possibility that he would come into office with a coterie of malevolent neckbeards . 
  unbeknownst to many , bojo actually has a degree in classical philosophy . 
  here he is in 2016 explaining why the ancient romans were actually uncultured bastards while fellow classicist mary beard attempts to defend them . 
   according to one u.s. official , national security aides have sought information about polish incursions in belarus , an eyebrow-raising request because little evidence of such activities appears to exist . 
  context :  at the national security council , a policymaking body within the white house , officials were startled when drafts began circulating of an executive order that would have opened the door to resuming torture and cia `` black site '' prisons . 
  nsc officials were asked to submit comments on the order , according to two u.s. officials , but the directive was ultimately scrapped , in part because defense secretary jim mattis opposed the measure . 
  spicer insisted the order did not originate in the white house . 
   nsc officials did voice substantial concerns with the executive order halting the u.s. refugee program and temporarily banning all entries to the u.s. from seven muslim-majority nations . 
  but officials said lengthy comments appeared to have been largely ignored by the trump political advisers who oversaw the order , namely chief strategist steve bannon and senior policy adviser stephen miller . 
  [ this is becoming a trope . 
  ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/evilchancellor ), 
  trump is just trump , an orange clown with no experience in government . 
  he 's not the republican or democratic party . 
  americans generally have no hostility to the eu on any level . 
  after reading your flair text , i might ask the same question . 
  if we were worried about competition from the eu , we would n't have spent so many decades consciously building it up . 
  all things being equal , it 's natural for it to be growing faster since it actually has more room to grow . 
  til we are quite sensitive about our mutant cattle . 
  and you 're worried about hormones in our beef ? 
  i thought that was obvious . 
  yeah , but i mean there were always more kings in germany than in france . 
  i guess it 's because germany was politically divided and therefore needed more castles , but yeah , they won this a couple of days ago and have just been showing off since . 
  nevermind . 
  again , [ shah mohammed freed millions of iranians from slavery . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_revolution ) he expanded literacy , instituted national healthcare , expanded voting to women , improved the economy , etc. 
  he was authoritarian but much more progressive than the islamists . 
  you 're falling for their mythology . 
  yes it was , actually . 
  the us remained the preferred destination for iranian students abroad , for example . 
  iran was easily our closest ally in the muslim world . 
  this is a part of history that the islamic republic does n't like to tell . 
  the truth is that the islamic revolution happened because shah mohammed was n't repressive * enough * for the mullahs , who hated reforms like allowing women and jews to vote and [ abolishing slavery . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_revolution#reforms ), 
  us-iranian relations were positive for 25 years after that . 
  it was the islamic revolution that changed things , and the soviets had a hand in that . 
  as a scholar , you might be interested to know that the average white american not only claims to have native american ancestors , but actually has native american ancestors , as established by modern genetcs . 
  the reservations did n't exist until the 1800s , after all , and tribes were assimilating from the moment colonization began . 
  i 'll take your word for it , but it really seems that way lately . 
  we 're not going to abandon democracy just because we 've elected a baboon . 
   but we do n't . 
  unfortunately you kinda do , and certainly may does . 
    we 're not `` arabia or china . '',

  no , we 're not , and please stop fantasizing about the collapse of our civil society .

  he 's the most disliked president since polling began . 
  no one likes him but we have to put up with him .

  xi jinping visits europe all the time and no one protests because no one cares . 
  [ been done . 
  ] ( http://crusader.wikia.com/wiki/world_economic_consortium ), 
  no , it 's true . 
  whites and natives have been intermarrying since 1607 . 
  it 's rare for whites whose family have lived in the country for a couple of generations not to have any native american dna , and all native americans have some white dna . 
  i like how in the next video it goes from extreme national shaming to extreme national self-worship for mutual assured cringiness . 
  eden 's own diplomats did n't even know about it . 
  his cabinet literally came up with it while drunk ; it was just a terrible idea and was opposed by everyone , including canada . 
   heredity positions instead of elected means you ca n't remove them from power if they are incompetent , that 's not true . 
  they can be forced to abdicate even for nonsensical reasons - see [ edward viii . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edward_viii ), 
   you would be more of a liability than an asset as a state . 
  that 's so incredibly shortsighted that i do n't think you could mean it seriously . 
   white america are the descendants of british colonists ... 
  they were the colonizers . 
  not the colonized . 
  white americans are also descendants of native americans . 
  and most native americans are also descendants of whites . 
  400 years of intermarriage has that effect . 
  we live in interesting times . 
  comparing our relationship in 1900 with 2017 , i think you 'll agree that we 're closer now in every way - not just geopolitically but also in entertainment , culture , everything . 
  it 's true of all countries but especially the anglo countries . 
  you do n't see many french or german actors/musicians in american media but it 's full of british . 
  that 's the path we 're on and will stay on .
