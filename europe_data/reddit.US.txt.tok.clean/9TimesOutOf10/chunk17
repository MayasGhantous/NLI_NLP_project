  imo , the impetus for federation will come when we realize that we ca n't compete with the eu , china and other rising powers on individual terms anymore . 
  i meant president of a hypothetical federation . 
  cultural affinity and the information revolution . 
   the thing is , the uk , australia , new zealand and canada will have even less power in that federation than the uk had in the eu . 
  not necessarily . 
  as pm , theresa may can be influenced by the united states . 
  as president , she could control the united states and the united kingdom and several other countries besides . 
  of course none of our countries would agree to that now , but we 're talking about the future . 
   also , are the british really going to like to become americanised , lost whatever left welfare they have ? 
  no more healthcare , even more expansive education , no minimum wages , no worker protection ... 
  even if they became the 51st state they 'd still have control over those things . 
  i 'm not a trump voter . 
  yes , and despite that ... 
  harking back , or looking forward ? 
  i 'd say it 's a mixture of the two . 
  and a realization that our past is connected to our future . 
  240 years after independence , our closest ally is still the uk and the [ five eyes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_eyes ) are the core of the empire . 
  [ we can form a federation of our own , ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/02/rise-anglosphere-how-right-dreamed-new-conservative-world-order ) which i 'm fairly confident is inevitable now that the uk is outside the eu . 
  i think people have started to realize since the '90s that history really is n't over yet , and it may actually have barely begun . 
  there 's still no clear winners and no real idea of how it will end , and we want to be in a position to have as much influence as possible . 
  ok i hate him , but lol . 
  i could be wrong but i actually think russia or china would be the first enemies to come to mind . 
  edit : i mean for us . 
  you 're talking about us . 
  why downvotes ? 
  it 's like darth vader without the jedi powers . 
  is n't the least bad thing by definition good ? 
  the eu has free trade with mexico , for that matter . 
  so you 're triggered by the word * warn ? 
  * are n't you overreacting a little ? 
  it was * merkel warns trump * a couple of days ago . 
   bojo 's worldview is a collage of british preconceptions about the continent . 
  bojo speaks seven languages , has a philosophy degree from oxford and has written several books on european history . 
  some of this seems to have been released backs in 2015 . 
  seems to be an ongoing thing . 
  yeah , i spent an hour just reading them , and the other documents . 
  insightful :  on 19 january cairo 's semi-official newspaper , al ahram , ran the full text of the us reply , calling it `` politically mean and immoral beyond imagination . '', 
  this is probably another of nasir 's celebrated tantrums ; he is quite capable of lashing out in ill-considered retaliation . 
  the favorable impression of the israeli press to the us reply will serve to confirm nasir in his own opinion . 
  obscure :  title : image analysis program [ redacted ] report #tob 67-20 on image analysis dated 21 april 1967  work program : carry out infectious development experiments consisting of counting the undeveloped silver halide crystals remaining in an exposed , d-19 developed , unfixed , 21 step tablet of sub-mono grain layer model emulsion number n-2-0056 depressing :  the mood of the majority of estonians in the towns , as well as in the country districts , is one of depression . 
  there is a constant feeling of living under a steadily increasing pressure . 
  people are waiting for the outbreak of war , which appears to them as the only way of escape from the present situation . 
  it is well known that the weapons of the future ( atomic and hydrogen bombs and bacteriological warfare ) are extremely powerful , for which reason destruction will be on a vast scale . 
  yet whoever survives it will be freed from the nightmare of communism . 
  thanks for posting . 
  21-22 april 1967 coup in greece : * [ situation report ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp79t00826a001800010075-4 ) * [ daily intelligence briefing ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/0005973764 ), 
   i 'd also remind you that the only nation to ever invoke article 5 is the fucking us . 
  because article 5 was n't invoked when your leaders wanted us in kosovo , libya etc. 
   the only reason the us supports nato is becuase it allows them to maintain their global hegemony . 
  there 's seldom only one reason for anything . 
  bush ? 
  clinton ? 
  they 're literally the same voices . 
  not that i agree with withdrawing from europe . 
  the president negotiates treaties , and congress ratifies them ( or does n't ) . 
  how ` bout * you * chillax ? 
  i did n't say it gave them a pass , but it does matter ; nation must come before party . 
  at least correct the record are americans . 
  it can be called political activism . 
  what russia does is information warfare ; it 's one nation trying to destabilize and subvert another . 
  and i never said the us did n't do that . 
  but you 're asking if this affects us , and so my answer is yes , of course it does . 
   cnn does n't even allow comments on their articles , but nice try . 
  [ this is just a random article i found . 
  ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/23/opinions/elections-hacks-russia-warning-zegart/ ) read the comments if you dare . 
  what you 're seeing is a modern take on the same agitation tactics the kgb employed for generations , and the tsarist government even before them . 
  it 's all to control information and channel dissent . 
  [ read this ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html ) if you have any further doubts . 
  and yes it affects us . 
   assuming either of those articles are factual , do you really believe that paid nternet trolls had any substantial effect ont he election ? 
  yes . 
  go to any single cnn article and you 'll notice that  90 % of the comments are pro-russia and anti-obama . 
  our internet has been flooded with trolls , and they 're the smallest weapon in russia 's infospace arsenal . 
   trump is demanding more than he is actually prepared to settle for . 
  while he offers to lift the sanctions on russia , let them keep crimea , etc. ? 
  is he demanding more than he 's actually planning to settle for in that case ? 
  it 's possible that that too is part of his attempt to push europe to spend more , but do you find that plausible ? 
   the people complaining about the emails are the ones still ranting everyday about `` muh russian interference '' and when they complain about that , they 're talking about the dnc emails . 
  no we 're not . 
  we 're talking about [ this bullshit . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7 ) and [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-sidney-blumenthal-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-benghazi-sputnik-508635 ) and [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/26/putin-s-wicked-leaks-didn-t-start-with-the-dnc.html ) and all the rest . 
  the emails are incidental . 
  russia has been waging information war against us for generations and trump is the result . 
  by making `` good deals '' with mad vlad ? 
  are you paying attention ? 
  i voted for clinton . 
  i do n't know how trump will affect our relationship with the eu , but it seems like a separate issue . 
  also i do n't think the eu wants to lose our business either . 
  no one 's talking about * british rule . 
  * is germany living under dutch rule ? 
  we 're talking about a union of some kind , not surrendering to the redcoats . 
  and why would we lose business with the eu ? 
  it 's just an idea . 
  but yeah , boris johnson and others have been advocating it for years . 
  i think it 's probably the direction we 're going , certainly more likely than leaving nato . 
  no , it 's more about joining together . 
  it 's the same concept as the eu . 
  and we 'd still be allied with the eu/nato , i 'd hope .
