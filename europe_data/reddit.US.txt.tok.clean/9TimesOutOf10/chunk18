  for us americans , i think the writing is on the wall . 
  china has 4x our population , india another 4x , even the eu has almost 2x . 
  we like our independence , but are also quite familiar with the concept of [ join or die . 
  ] ( http://www.everydaynodaysoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/craigfergusontattoo.jpg ), 
  this is n't really about markets or short-term economic considerations , though , as the article says :  their essential argument is that a new world order -- based on cultural affinity -- is evolving in response to the information revolution some ( including prominent british and american historians ) are supporting brexit and anglosphere simply because of their views on the past and future world order . 
  they see a reunified british empire as the core of a global federation . 
  this is some 1930s-style big thinking ; it goes well beyond the prospects of the london financial sector . 
  that reminds me of benjamin franklin complaining about all the german immigrants taking over pennsylvania . 
  you make a fair point about cultural outlook . 
  one of the comments on the article gave a possible rebuttal :  you do have a point on ethnicity demographics , but many of those new demographic populations are adoptiong the anglo culture and language as their own . 
  that makes the anglosphere even a stronger reality , because it gives a true core nexus to a global melting point , and the start of the first truly global culture . 
  it 's also true that we 've been drifting closer together with the uk for generations now even while promoting its eu membership . 
  it 's not unusual anymore to see british hosts interviewing british celebrities on american talk shows . 
  i do n't see that trend reversing itself ... 
  anyway , since i noticed the link had n't been posted to r/europe yet , i decided to post it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5o1c8f/five_reasons_the_anglosphere_is_more_than_just_a/, 
  but i think the idea is that there wo n't be a us or a uk anymore , only one entity . 
  how do you feel about her majesty 's american states ? 
   this does n't even make sense geopolitically as the uk inside the eu was much more of an asset for the us than a uk outside of it . 
  hence obama 's campaign to keep the uk in . 
  economically , in the short term , yes . 
  but that 's a limited perspective :  advocates suggest that , in the twenty-first century , the anglosphere is becoming a distinct civilisation in its own right . 
  their essential argument is that a new world order -- based on cultural affinity -- is evolving in response to the information revolution , and that those nations best placed to exploit it are those with a strong civil society , most notably the anglosphere countries . 
   http://www.cityam.com/255648/five-reasons-anglosphere-more-than-just-romantic-vision-but obama is a committed globalist . 
  his vision of the future is one in which all nations are equal and irrelevant . 
  but that 's a future grounded in the assumptions of the past , the `` end of history '' nonsense from the 1990s . 
  others ( including prominent british and american historians ) supported brexit because history is n't over yet and may be just beginning . 
  you 're no fun . 
  to continue the persecution , france 's history in syria would make lolworthy fiction :  on 29 may 1945 , france bombed damascus and tried to arrest its democratically elected leaders . 
  while french planes were bombing damascus , prime minister faris al-khoury was at the founding conference of the united nations in san francisco , presenting syria 's claim for independence from the french mandate . 
   ukraine is in no state to join , they need a good 25 - 30 years of their own citizens taking care of their own society ... 
  they started roughly equal to poland wrt gdp in the 1990s and look at the difference now . 
  and poland began the process of joining nato in 1992 . 
  i do n't know who you 're referring to but our experience has shown that no one is incapable of assimilating into such a society . 
  [ when she does shit like this ... ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html ), 
  oops , was i supposed to agree that pashtuns ca n't govern themselves ? 
  is racism still seen as a serious opinion in some cultures ? 
  help me understand this . 
  you disapprove of `` exporting democracy , '' so then i guess you approve of friendly relations with the taliban ? 
  what do you want exactly ? 
  [ actually , the anglo countries all spy on each other . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_eyes ) it 's a mutually beneficial arrangement for counter-terrorism purposes . 
  you would n't say that if it was your country . 
  [ afghans have been putting their lives on the line for years for democracy . 
  ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/world/asia/afghanistan-kabul-taliban-massacre.html?_r=1&amp;mtrref=www.reddit.com&amp;gwh=9d0c823c30f590e156d8290be0251852&amp;gwt=pay ) we do n't need to export it , only support it . 
  [ that was mostly pakistan . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taliban#role_of_the_pakistani_military ) and afghanistan just completed its first democratic transfer of power in its modern history . 
  if you ca n't see the benefit in that , maybe we should n't be allies . 
  defending human rights and liberty aids more than one member . 
  i think he 's pretty predictable , in that he 's ultimately a populist and supports whatever is popular .

  trump is tapping into that . 
  but in the end , [ nato is always more popular .

   ` the big why ? ' is psychologically appealing but it is a mistake . 
  in general terms it is the wrong way to look at history and it is specifically wrong about the referendum . 
  this this this , a million times this . 
  the big why is also a common theme of nazis , communists , conspiracy theorists , religious extremists and most other forms of political crazy people . 
  not really , no . 
  no , i really do n't . 
  i laughed at the tweet because of its cheekiness in taunting the uk 's foreign policy position , accompanied by a humorously trollish image . 
  if it had been an image of the simpsons ' mcbain [ delivering unicef pennies ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_jhrrjqce0 ) in some relevant criticism of unicef it could have been just as funny . 
  the age of the image has no effect on my reaction . 
  yes . 
  i do n't see a meaningful difference . 
  but that does n't determine how funny it is . 
  i still see 20-year-old simpsons references in reddit comments all the time . 
  what 's actually funny will still be funny years from now . 
   old  reminiscent of 2010 are n't you in high school ? 
  i think that explains it : 2010 is very old to you . 
  later on , a few years wo n't make such a difference . 
   i have no idea why there 's two people now who want to pretend europe is no different from north and south america do n't put words in my mouth . 
  obviously there are differences . 
  but i do n't think what you said is true . 
  economic conditions in the major nations of the americas are more alike than in western and eastern europe . 
  even culturally , we 're more alike : we have only two major languages , three including brazil , and a common colonial history , culture and traditions . 
  we 've had the same form of government for hundreds of years ( even the same structure of government ; mexico is the estados unidos mexicanos , after all ) and in all that time have hardly ever been at war . 
  so why does n't this also apply to us ? 
  even so , is it * that * different ? 
  and bearing in mind that this union includes the free movement of people , meaning all latin americans would be entitled to us citizenship and we would n't be allowed to exercise any control over the flow of people across our borders ? 
   our economies and levels of development are too different [ the difference between the us and mexico is nowhere near the differences in the eu . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ), 
  obama , is that you ? 
  he can interfere , but final authority on us troop deployments belongs to [ congress . 
  ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/17/politics/aumf-isis-house-vote-fails-us-troops/ ), 
  [ is it actually ? 
  ] ( http://www.projetaladin.org/holocaust/en/they-dare-to-speak/imam-tareq-oubrou.html ), 
  even if you are , if it takes you that long , you should probably consider moving somewhere closer to your workplace . 
  [ at least once before .

  the average commute in chicago is [ 30 minutes . 
  ] ( https://project.wnyc.org/commute-times-us/embed.html#5.00/43.739/-92.181 ) if it takes you 3 and a half hours to get across town , you 're doing it wrong .

  early ksp rockets . 
  it would be so easy to turn that into a sculpture . 
   what are some examples to what europeans are usually wrong about regarding american politics ? 
  they think we 're militarists . 
  plenty of european countries have more soldiers per capita than we do . 
  our military is expensive because it 's mostly in naval and air power . 
  sure , but we 're not fighting in ukraine .
