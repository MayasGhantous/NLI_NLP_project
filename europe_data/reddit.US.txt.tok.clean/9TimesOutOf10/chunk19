  follow-up tweet : i was being sarcastic . 
  of course it was n't serious . 
  i did n't even think it could be interpreted seriously . 
  why is there such sensitivity on this ? 
  i even got the `` you 've probably never been outside the us '' reply . 
  yes , in some countries , but this article is american political media ( the hill ) , and these attitudes simply [ are n't representative of our population . 
  ] ( https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2016/12/russia-overall-trend.gif&amp;w=480 ) these are putinbots . 
  on the subject of alleged russian concerns over nato missiles in ukraine , you are falling for a demonstrable lie . 
  look at the map . 
  russia already has nuclear missiles closer than cuba . 
  their submarines and bombers patrol our coastline from the arctic to the gulf of mexico . 
  they can legally come within a few miles of our major cities . 
  concerns like you 're describing vanished a long time ago . 
  putin does n't care where we put our missiles . 
  that 's just a pretext for aggression . 
  you mean it 's not an irradiated wasteland full of hillbillies and psychos ? 
  i mean , obviously not . 
  it was a facetious reference to the history of the western balkans being on the borders of different superstates . 
  well , balkans . 
  a reference to a pc game full of guns . 
  what else to expect from the original borderlands ? 
  of course they 're putinbots . 
  then there 's even less reason to do it . 
  it does n't matter much what trump thinks . 
  congress is still congress , the state department , the military , etc. 
  and of course the public . 
  our foreign policy of 70 years is n't going to be reversed because of one man . 
  [ awkward ... ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20141210044147/http://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html ), 
   whatever is going on in manitoba is another detail that is something on its own entirely . 
  that 's your assumption , but it 's not true . 
  manitoba is bordered to the west by saskatchewan , with a homicide rate of 3.63 , and to the north by nunavut , 5.52 . 
  and bordering those states are alberta ( 3.17 ) and northwest territories ( 11.3 ) . 
  it 's not a manitoba thing . 
  in reality , most of canada 's provinces have american-level homicide rates . 
   so far all i 've heard from you is avoiding the obvious problems ( i.e. 
  difference in gun laws , gang culture , welfare ) all you 've actually head from me is correcting other people 's bullshit . 
   it would be helpful if you actually point out what these alternative reasons would be according to you . 
  [ i 've tried to do that ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5kj2qj/homicide_rates_europe_vs_the_usa/dbpmyft/ ) as well . 
   your point being that if you walk across the border from canada to america , you dont suddenly become a blood thirsty murderer ? 
  i think everyone could already assume border areas will be more similar to each other . 
  you might have missed it , but when i referred to minnesota ( 1.3 ) and manitoba ( 4.3 ) , minnesota is on the american side of the border . 
  so it 's not a case of `` border areas being more similar to each other . '', 
  those two states are actually more different than america ( 3.9 ) and canada ( 1.5 ) , and the difference is in reverse . 
  it 's just reality being more complex than expectations . 
  and minnesota is n't unpopulated ; it 's the 21st most populous state with 5 million people . 
  the [ minneapolis-st . paul ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minneapolis ) metro area has 3 million . 
  it also has some of the most lax gun laws in the country . 
  no one has any difficulty admitting the existence of problem areas and communities . 
  the issue is with over-generalizing them and attributing them to national cultural idiosyncrasies that actually do n't exist or are n't related to the problems . 
   i honestly dont care about who 's more developed , i 'd just like to visit america and feel safe . 
  for an american it might be easy to avoid problem neighborhoods etc , but an adventurous tourist is much more likely to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . 
  tourists do n't tend to go to the bad areas of any country . 
  if you visit dc , the annual cherry blossom season is probably the best time , although it does get crowded . 
   why are you not getting that a significant difference exists ? 
  i am . 
  but we 're not talking about significant differences , but the `` large disparity '' that ( according to you ) exists between the united states and not only canada , but `` any developed nation . '', 
   this is a classic example of cherry picking . 
  it 's looking closely , which is what you have to do if you actually want to understand any of these issues . 
  for example , why does manitoba have a homicide rate of 4.3 ? 
  why do the northwest territories have a homicide rate of 11 ? 
  it 's partly because of canada 's issues with its aboriginal population . 
  and if you look at [ the map i showed you ] ( http://brilliantmaps.com/wp-content/uploads/distribution-gun-related-homicides.jpg ) in the first place , you 'll notice that * detailed * maps of the american homicide rate resemble , to an extent , maps of plantation slavery . 
  and hispanic immigration , which canada does n't have . 
  you just called mexico a third-world country . 
  it 's a developed country , but ok : if 30 % of a state 's population are recent immigrants from a third-world country , what does that do to the state 's homicide rate ? 
  and comparing american states and canadian provinces is useful because : minnesota : 1.3 manitoba : 4.3 if you actually look at american and canadian states that border each other , your general indication of the difference between the us and canada breaks down . 
  and be honest , would you ever describe central canada as not being a developed nation ? 
  no , you would n't . 
   such a stark difference  such a large disparity  a 200 % difference no matter how you dress it up , the difference between canada ( 1.4 ) and the us ( 3.9 ) is less than the difference between saskatchewan and qu\u00e9bec . 
  there 's no `` stark '' or `` large disparity '' between america and canada . 
  they 're each federations of states . 
  american states ' homicide rates range from 1.1 to 10.8 ; canadian provinces , from 0.6 to 11.3 . 
  the difference between the two countries is less than the average variation between two american states chosen at random . 
   the closest equivalent to european regions is , as said before , us states . 
  [ and we both know that 's a lie . 
  ] ( http://travel-made-simple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/us-europe-size-comparison.jpg )  2 ` points ' difference is a 200 % difference , it is 2 . 
  2 people in 100,000 . 
  you 're statistically more likely to be killed by secondhand smoking in france than by crime in america . 
   this map is supposed to represent the murder rate in europe . 
  it * obviously * illustrates not a single murder rate , but murder rates * across * europe . 
  therefore it 's only logical , if you want a meaningful comparison , to show murder rates across america at a similar scale . 
  not at the scale of countries . 
   err no . 
  a 400 % ( or there abouts ) difference is not ` marginal ' by any stretch of the imagination . 
  it is marginal : these are tiny , marginal numbers , especially in relation to other states ; mexico 's border states next door have homicide rates exceeding ** 60 , ** and you are harping on a difference of 2 points between the us and canada as :  a stupidly high murder rate for any developed nation [ that 's all it 's about . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=banpds2qlc4&amp;t=20m35s ), 
  my point is obvious . 
  from the beginning , it 's been the same : a more detailed map gives a more informative picture of homicide rates in america than a map that represents each state as a single uniform blotch of color . 
  i showed you the size of texas to illustrate just how much geography you were rendering as a uniform blotch . 
  you do n't care because to you , that does n't matter . 
  as you [ said , ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5kj2qj/homicide_rates_europe_vs_the_usa/dboyuz6/ ) the only thing that matters to you is that the european rate is better than the american one , even if it 's a single number that is meaningless to any potential traveler or resident . 
  seriously look at this post . 
  12,100 upvotes and rising ; damn near the best thing that 's ever happened to r/europe 's users is an image showing the us to have marginally more homicides than europe . 
  this is so pathetic . 
  yeah because the us has only one homicide rate that is applicable everywhere you go . 
  you are ridiculous . 
  and it 's 3.9 , not 4.5 . 
  i wo n't even guess why you 're insisting that it 's more accurate or informative to represent the us in flat sections larger than european countries , but it 's not . 
  forget marijuana . 
  dc does n't even have snow plows .
