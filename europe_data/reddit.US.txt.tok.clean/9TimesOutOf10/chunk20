  [ do you realize how much detail you 're cutting out of the us map ?

  going by the graph on the op , you 're pretty obviously wrong . 
  and i thought the map might add some context . 
  it would probably help you see that if it included the mexican border states , with homicide rates in the [ 40s . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#mexico ) and the canadian provinces with murder rates identical to the northern us .

  this appears to be crack to you guys . 
  the fact that it 's just europe vs usa rather than europe vs north america also lends some credibility to the hypothesis . 
  there is a very big difference between 1/100000 and 1.5 / 100000 ? 
  eh , 600 comments in 2 hours , upvoted 1300 + . 
  they might . 
  =p but without knowing where the map comes from , we ca n't assume that was the reason for the color palette . 
  eh , the american revolution was barely a revolution at all . 
  the colonies were already democratic and largely autonomous . 
  all they did was declare independence and form a federal government .

  looking at the values given for the colors : 1.0 - 1.5 1.5 - 2.5 2.5 - 7.0 why ? 
  ( edit : in case anyone wants a genuine partial explanation , the [ original map ] ( http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_global_homicide_book_web.pdf ) published by the un did n't include the us . 
  it was added for comparison and painted to the original map 's scale . 
  so not necessarily any intent to distort . 
  still a weird scale . ), 
  the report mentions cameron 's proposal . 
  i still think it 's interesting . 
  what i always like about these reports is the candor , which in this case ranges from mild sarcasm :  for half a century , many european elites have pushed toward the sunlit uplands of ` ever closer union . ', 
  to social criticism :  the current socialist government has highlighted a long-standing french social pathology : french society has a problem with wealthy individuals . 
  it has a culture of intense jealousy that forces wealthy and entrepreneurial business people to emigrate , resulting in the loss of business investment . 
  good thing there 's that disclaimer at the beginning , noting that the views/opinions in this paper should not be construed as an official u.s. government position . 
  report is dated 2013 . 
   the uk is diverging from continental europe in a steady path toward a semi-detached status or even an exit from the eu . 
  ...  then there is the north-south divergence over immigration . 
  the one trigger for a break-up in the future might be a dispute over leaky weak points on the european perimeter ( like greece , italy , and spain ) that allow non-european immigrants into europe because of incompetence or corruption or lack of manpower ...  if , however , the german economy drops and poland sinks with it , one could imagine the nationalist party ( law and justice ) possibly winning a coalition and pushing poland toward an anti-russian , conspiratorial , muscular , euro-skeptic and anti-secular direction . 
  i 'm not saying you ca n't ; i 'm asking how ? 
  [ nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalism ) is the principle of the sovereignty and self-determination of nations under their own states , nation states . 
  political/economic integration of 28 nation states together seems opposed to that principle . 
  what always occurs to me is canada 's solution , where you have [ qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois nationalism , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quebec_nationalism ) but a superior [ canadian nationalism ] ( http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2015/02/national-flag-of-canada-day-justin-trudeau.jpg?quality=65&amp;strip=all ) overrules it . 
  but if that 's what you want , then you do n't want german nationalism but european nationalism . 
  `` three cheers for the lesser evil ! '', 
  i just ca n't see it . 
  besides , the intergovernmental approach does n't seem to work - 28 members each with veto power is a recipe for perpetual inaction . 
   i think , if true ( and i 'm not german nor have i lived in germany , so i ca n't speak to this ) , that it 's problematic if afd is the only party in germany giving an outlet to nationalistic feelings . 
  that guarantees that the only expression for nationalism is tied to xenophobia and anti-eu sentiments . 
  but here 's the dilemma : how can more centrist parties embrace nationalism and eu integration at the same time ? 
  the top-rated comment is from someone claiming to be american while spelling libya * lybia . 
  children 's crusade . . 
  or maybe just russian and a patriot ? 
  and we do n't hate serbs either . 
  our involvement in serbia and libya was in support of european allies . 
  and iraq in 2003 was unfinished business from 1991 . 
   also the uk and the us traditionally hate russians . 
  i 've never heard any american say anything hateful about russians . 
  they 're on the other side of the planet . 
  we have nothing personally against them , unlike latvians , etc. 
  edit : and the basic idea of attacking russia is just surreal . 
  how ? 
  we do n't even have an army that could successfully invade russia , and what we do have is n't anywhere near russia . 
  [ we ca n't even win our own simulations . 
  ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/18/exclusive-the-pentagon-is-preparing-new-war-plans-for-a-baltic-battle-against-russia/ ) and how could we afford a war with russia ? 
  and why ? 
  have we grown tired of living ? 
  none of this makes any sense . 
  almost everyone still does . 
  nationalism ( the organization of society into nation states ) is the basic organizing principle of the modern world . 
  that first sentence :  the dire warning issued by the departing president of poland 's highest constitutional court was one that should frighten not only the poles , but people of all democratic nations in which populist rulers have taken or threaten to take power . 
  til that democratic nations have `` rulers '' , and that rather than being elected they `` threaten to take power . '',

   you 've had allies , every country in the east went with you https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multi-national_force_%e2%80%93_iraq#troop_deployment_in_iraq_2003.e2.80.932011  what do you expect was supposed to happen if france went with you ? 
  the iraqis would have stopped being people torn by sectartian conflict suppressed for years by a dictarship that took sides ? 
  and what do you think would have happened otherwise ? 
  saddam would have lived forever , thus avoiding an otherwise inevitable four-way civil war between the iraqi army , sunni/shia militias and kurds that would most likely have spilled over into syria , iran and turkey ? 
  and what use is democracy outside of europe anyway , right ? 
   but even this high estimate is equal to the high estimated number of deaths caused by the war over the next decade ( including those caused by lawlessness , breaking of infrastructure etc. ) . 
  deaths which could have been avoided if we 'd had allies . 
  even without allies , most of it could have been avoided . 
  and this is ignoring the fact that russia spent years destabilizing iraq through syria and iran , and the saudi/iran proxy wars , the syrian civil war and everything else that 's happened since then , including the mistakes of the iraqis themselves . 
  blaming everything on four weeks of military intervention in 2003 is simply childish . 
    no , they were actually saying they 'd use their veto to block the un from doing it  because the charges where made up . 
  that 's another clear lie . 
  no one thought they were made up .
