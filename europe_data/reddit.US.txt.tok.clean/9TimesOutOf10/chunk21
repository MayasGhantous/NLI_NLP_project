  [ france 's position was that it preferred sanctions as the best means of disarmament ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/french_address_on_iraq_at_the_un_security_council ) - the same sanctions that had impoverished iraq and killed up to a million iraqis , mostly children , over the previous 10 years . 
   germany and france at the time said : this is against international law and a very bad idea idea on top of it . 
  no one at the time objected based on international law . 
  schr\u00f6der was 110 % in favor of the kosovo war without a un resolution . 
  vladimir putin led the effort to block un authorization for iraq , and france and germany joined him , and none of them were concerned about international law or iraq . 
  and on the subject of shitfests , at least when the us went into iraq , it committed its own forces and stayed for years trying to build democracy and stability . 
  the eu decided to attack libya , and all it did was bomb the shit out of it from the air and go home . 
  no , they were actually saying they 'd use their veto to block the un from doing it . 
  and refusing to help iraq for 10 years had no positive results for europe . 
  being a superpower means that the us is involved everywhere . 
  but saying that chile 's coup was `` the doing of the us '' is completely full of shit . 
  the us did n't make the chilean supreme court * unanimously * denounce allende . 
  they did n't make the legislature accuse him of dictatorship and call on the army to impose order . 
  and the chilean army was also made up of chileans , not americans . 
  this is the same thing you greeks do . 
  greeks drove tanks over each other , butchered each other , imposed a regime , but to this day you blame america ( and lately the eu ) for your government . 
  if you want to be a third-world country , keep doing that . 
   you deliberately avoided everything in the article apart from whatever you can quote to further your narrative . 
  i did n't . 
  but that 's exactly what you just did . 
  you quoted :  high ranking state department officials including then secretary of state , henry kissinger had secretly given their approval to argentina 's new military rulers . 
  you deliberately cut out the first half of that sentence , which reads :  ** despite ** the fact that at least six us citizens had been `` disappeared '' by the argentine military by 1976 and ** the fact that the us embassy in buenos aires had been pushing argentina 's government to respect human rights , ** high ranking state department officials including then secretary of state , henry kissinger had secretly given their approval to argentina 's new military rulers . 
  and `` giving them approval '' means exactly what i just quoted : kissinger telling them that the we would n't make trouble for them , but urging them to get back to normal quickly and that any freedoms they could restore would be helpful . 
   the us was also a key provider of economic and military assistance to the videla regime during the earliest and most intense phase of the repression . 
  the us was a key supplier of economic and military assistance to argentina , before , during and after the repression . 
  that is not what you said , `` financing the coup . '', 
  the difference is that words like * involvement * and * backing * do n't mean what you 're implying . 
  even your article does n't support the narrative of us aggression :  on 5 october 1976 [ edit : after the coup ] kissinger met with argentina 's foreign minister and stated :  `` look , our basic attitude is that we would like you to succeed . 
  i have an old-fashioned view that friends ought to be supported . 
  what is not understood in the united states is that you have a civil war . 
  we read about human rights problems but not the context . 
  the quicker you succeed the better ... 
  the human rights problem is a growing one . 
  your ambassador can apprise you . 
  we want a stable situation . 
  we wo n't cause you unnecessary difficulties . 
  if you can finish before congress gets back , the better . 
  ** whatever freedoms you could restore would help . 
  '' ** argentina 's 1976 coup was the result of internal politics , and the us 's reaction was basically the same as balbin 's : we wo n't give you any trouble . 
  that would be another example of blaming us for other people 's politics , yes :  the ucr initiated impeachment proceedings against the president in february with the support of the `` rebel '' peronist faction in congress . 
  near defeat though still active , the montoneros detonated a bomb at army headquarters on 15 march , killing one and injuring 29 people . 
  [ 16 ] the head of the cge , julio broner , left argentina with his family , altogether ; cgt secretary general casildo herreras followed suit , announcing from exile that he had `` erased '' himself . 
  the leader of the opposition ucr ricardo balb\u00edn , while making efforts to form a multi-party congressional crisis committee , held a private meeting in february with army chief of staff videla and told him , `` if you 're planning to stage a coup , do so as soon as possible - expect no applause from us , but no obstacles either . 
  '' [ 27 ] the media were by then openly counting down the days to the expected coup d'\u00e9tat , and several newspapers published editorials calling for per\u00f3n 's overthrow . 
  [ 28 ] even as the joint chiefs professed loyalty to la presidente , the armed forces high command had already given final approval to a coup , code-named ` operation aries ' , when the president returned from her leave of absence in october 1975 . 
  [ 29 ]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isabel_mart%c3%adnez_de_per%c3%b3n#fall_from_power, 
   and from the same link you sent , the cia too funded allende 's opposition ... 
  it actually says that they did n't :  the cia did not provide direct assistance to any candidate , as they had during the 1964 elections , but rather focused on anti-allende propaganda , ultimately spending $ 425,000 . 
  but what is your point ? 
  no one denies that the us opposed allende . 
  so did the chilean congress , supreme court and armed forces . 
  what point are you actually making ? 
   but they were backed by us money and forces . 
  not if by * forces , * you mean military forces . 
  there were no us military forces involved in those examples . 
  and [ the kgb funded allende , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chilean_presidential_election,_1970 ) who was elected by a razor-thin margin . 
  but ultimately it was a chilean crisis , and all the main actors were chilean . 
  it was hardly irrelevant that france and germany decided not to help , to oppose us at the un in 2003 [ and on enlarging nato in 2008 ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html ) etc. 
  it at least neutralizes them as threats to russian geopolitics . 
  and if putin had n't overreached and got caught red-handed in crimea , it 's possible that it would still be like that today . 
   russia has nothing on west when it comes to propaganda - it 's a baby in the boxing ring with a heavyweight champion . 
  so then , how do europeans generally feel about american foreign policy , in the middle east , in asia , or anywhere except europe itself ? 
   are you serious ? 
  you 're defending pinochet 's decades-long dictatorship as `` a provisional government '' ? 
  is n't that what it was ? 
   also , why do you think that us-backed dictatorships are better than the governments that the people actually voted in ? 
  they 're not `` us-backed . '', 
  they are what they are , iranian and chilean . 
  99.99 % of the people involved in chile 's coup were chilean . 
  let 's take some responsibility for our body politic . 
  * democratically elected * does n't mean * democratic . 
  * both mossadegh and allende were massively unpopular at the time , which is why mossadegh had to fake that referendum in the first place . 
  today , chileans are still split over pinochet , with [ 55 % ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-24014501 ) having a negative opinion . 
  [ in some cases they actually were better . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_revolution#reforms ), 
  your saying this just demonstrates how badly we 've been losing the information war . 
  the democratically elected leaders you 're talking about : prime minister mohammad mosaddegh , who used an illegal referendum [ which he won with 99.9 % of the vote ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iranian_parliamentary_dissolution_referendum,_1953 ) to dissolve parliament and declare himself a dictator , and who was dismissed by the legal head of state , arrested , tried and given a three-year prison sentence . 
  president salvador allende , who was unanimously denounced by the chilean supreme court for violating the constitution and who killed himself before he could be arrested , resulting in the military instituting a provisional government headed by augusto pinochet . 
  and president jean-bertrand aristide , the less said about whom , the better . 
  [ or mexico . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ), 
   you can actually see some of why russia and china have issues with the us , america has never respected either . 
  in fact it banned chinese from entering the us for a long time . 
  that 's been greatly exaggerated . 
  america was in fact the only western power to have an [ equal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burlingame_treaty ) relationship with china at that time . 
  also [ prevented china from being partitioned in 1900 , ] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=bp4totyndlkc&amp;pg=pt365&amp;lpg=pt365&amp;dq= `` america + seems + to + desire + that + nobody + shall + get + anything + out + of + china '' & source = bl & ots = ib0pilcqlw & sig = hkeakecdgucoxqs6bcngwhd6_bi & hl = en & sa = x & ved = 0ahukewjtx-zaw_zqahwrzimkhymobveq6aeihdaa #v = onepage & q = `` america seems to desire that nobody shall get anything out of china '' & f = false ) prevented the empress dowager from being forced to abdicate , etc. 
  of course americans were never free of racism , and neither were chinese , but in spite of our differences the us-china relationship was generally positive . 
  russia was also an [ ally ] ( http://www.voltairenet.org/article169488.html ) for much of the century . 
  they sold us alaska !, 
  austria kitten , get out of there !, 
  unfortunately not true . 
  the american public turned against military action in iraq almost as soon as it began . 
  as soon as the * causus belli * was removed we wanted out , and with little regard for the consequences . 
  i guess i am . 
  and :  from a `` rest-of-the-world '' standpoint http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015, 
  wrong continent . 
  gib monies . 
  i was unclear . 
  what i meant was that in contrast to anglo countries ' subs , the users on this sub are n't drawn from the whole population of europe , but only from the % of it who speak english , usually as a second language . 
  the requirement of bilingualism does n't guarantee insightful opinions , but it at least cuts down on the number of absolute morons .
