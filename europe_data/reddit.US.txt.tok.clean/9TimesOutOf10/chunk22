  i do n't like trump , but look at what the results of his taiwan comments have actually been :  the asian diplomat said some chinese officials had expressed `` euphoria '' at trump 's election , believing it marked the end of u.s. dominance in the world and represented china 's chance to seized the initiative . 
   but trump 's unexpected move to put the taiwan issue center stage in relations with china had put an end to that . 
   `` they 're not as happy now , '' he said . 
   http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-china-analysis-iduskbn1430j8?il=0 they * were * dismissing him as a fool . 
  now they 're not . 
  it 's completely put them on the back foot . 
  and it seems from sources close to trump that instead of something random , these comments and his talk with tsai were actually planned months ago . 
  the truth is , china needs our cooperation on taiwan . 
  without it , they have no way to enforce `` one china '' except through naked brutality . 
  trump has ended their pretense of not needing our help , and their pretense of civility , and all it took was a phone call . 
  we 're all under 18 , so you have to let us stay . 
  part of the problem with r/worldnews and r/politics is that you ca n't post text posts like this one . 
  or images , graphs , etc. 
  only media articles , and only new ones . 
  so it 's just a running chorus of media opinion . 
  also the fact that most users on this sub are communicating in a second language . 
  so instead of the entirety of the population it 's the 50 % or so who are at least bilingual , which changes things somewhat . 
  i guess this makes you a better author than simon head . 
  a billion times worse than frankenstein and the wolfman put together . 
  for context : [ president tsai refuses to accept the one-china principle . 
  ] ( http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2025722/beijing-unshakeable-one-china-principle-taiwan ), 
   even taiwan president cai ying wen never mentioned the independance in her speech . 
  ... because the prc would invade if she had . 
  but she has [ refused ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/22/china-pressures-taiwans-president-tsai-ing-wen-to-acknowledge-one-china.html ) to endorse the one-china principle , which is the same as a declaration of independence . 
  you 're aware that taiwan is currently governed by its independence party and that they 're hoping to declare independence ? 
  no one wants the status quo except china . 
  eh , it was a long campaign and we all knew when he refused to release his tax documents that he was hiding something . 
  everyone knew about his friendship with putin , his connection to russia , his disdain for nato . 
  i feel like we 're 1946 germany and are going to spend the next few years telling ourselves we did n't know , and sure , some of us did n't , but most of us did . 
  but ultimately he 's just one individual , and no individual can dictate our national policy . 
  it 's good to be aware of what russia did , but it was only one factor . 
  if a few more spoiled millennials had actually voted , that would also have made the difference . 
  i do n't want to see us adopting the third-world habit of blaming other nations for our decisions . 
  at least the public is starting to become aware of it . 
  because we 're not naive enough to be surprised by such corruption . 
  even lincoln had to bribe his way to abolishing slavery . 
  a certain degree of moral flexibility is often required in politics . 
  what 's more important is how it affects the nation . 
  i do n't know what 's going to happen there . 
  but russia is honestly a lot less vulnerable than china . 
  russia is united . 
  china is a bunch of fragile oligarchs afraid of their own people . 
  they ca n't go against us and they know it . 
  and i must say it actually feels good to see our president-elect talking to tsai and calling one-china into question . 
  taiwan is peaceful and democratic . 
  there 's no reason we need to bow to china over this . 
   trump 's tweet on the criminalization of the burning of the american flag is a distillation of his patriotic worldview . 
  til we 've never been patriotic before . 
  i humbly suggest : because they do n't actually need to satisfy your standards ; all they need to do is get votes . 
  it does n't really , just an opportunity for guardian-bashing . 
  but on the other hand , they have lots of children of working age . 
  of course that 's true ; i was just offering an explanation for why immigrants form their own communities . 
  when moving to a new country , especially with a very different culture , it 's natural to want to be surrounded by the trappings of the familiar and by others who share your experiences . 
  also , the length of time depends partly on how long immigration lasts . 
  if new waves of immigrants continue to arrive , then even over multiple generations , there will always be a sizable reservoir of fresh-off-the-boat types . 
  not taking a side here , but [ we 're kind of used to that .

  to join in , visit www.theguardian.com/clarkcounty and enter your email address . 
  you 'll receive , by email , the name and postal address of a clark county voter . 
  we have included only those voters who chose to list themselves as unaffiliated , instead of as republican or democrat : that is no guarantee that they are persuadable , of course , but it does increase the chances . 
  the data on which our system is based is publicly available , but we have designed it to give out each address only once , so there is no danger of recipients getting deluged . 
   in formulating your letter , you will need to introduce yourself : no individual clark county voter will have any reason to be expecting your communication . 
  and in choosing your arguments , keep in mind the real risk of alienating your reader by coming across as interfering or offensive . 
  you might want to handwrite your letter , for additional impact , and we strongly recommend including your own name and address - it lends far more credibility to your views , and you might get a reply . 
   finally , post your letter soon . 
  letters sent by regular airmail from the uk to the us usually take five days to reach their recipient , and there is little time to waste . 
  postage costs 43p for a postcard , 47p for a letter weighing 10g or less , and 68p for a letter weighing up to 20g . 
  you do n't have to visit a post office , but royal mail recommends writing `` par avion - by airmail '' on the front of the envelope , and your return address on the back . ), 
  yes , the guardian in its wisdom encouraged uk readers to send unsolicited letters to random americans to tell us who to vote for in 2004 . 
  can you be any more specific ? 
  so what specifically do you suggest governments should do about this ? 
  that stood out for me too . 
  it seems to be the same thing as in other western democracies . 
   mr duk invited wilders supporters to email him to explain their motivation . 
   `` i expected ` hate islam , love wilders ' kind of thing , that 's how the pvv voter is framed , the angry white man , but it 's much more complex now . 
  it 's entrepreneurs , teachers , church leaders , people who feel the traditional parties on all sides of the spectrum simply are n't listening to their concerns . 
  immigrants tend to form ethnic enclaves because it helps them adjust to life in a foreign society . 
  eventually they become fully assimilated , but it 's a multi-generational process . 
  that 's what you 're doing . 
  but understanding that requires some familiarity with [ saudi politics .

  but of course it is n't going to affect him , because anyone who would vote for him does n't agree with the conviction . 
   this is full of shit . 
  first of all pieter de crem is n't royalty . 
  the article says :  mayor ivy taylor is looking back on ** her royal highness ** princess astrid 's visit to san antonio earlier this week , along with ** his excellency ** pieter de crem . 
  but why would royalty from belgium come to texas ? 
  * his excellency * is a style of address for non-royal officials . 
  for example , [ his excellency johan verbeke , ambassador of belgium to the united states .

  `` benghazi !! '', 
  ... for the past 100 years . 
  they have exactly the same views on some issues , which is [ not a coincidence .

  [ that 's nothing new .

   no , that 's a conspiracy . 
  [ it 's politics .
