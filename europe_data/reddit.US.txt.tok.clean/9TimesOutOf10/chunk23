  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7 ) and yeah , [ all ] ( http://americablog.com/2016/08/jill-stein-moscow-criticized-us-human-rights-said-nothing-russian-human-rights.html ) of them are involved . 
  i 'm not saying they 're all members of a russian psyop unit , but russia has its geopolitical interests and it pursues them , and people like stein , assange and trump are its useful idiots . 
  [ jeremy corbyn ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stop-the-war-linked-to-putin-puppets-s6fdwq968 ) is another who can be added to the pile . 
  and [ oliver stone , ] ( https://rbth.com/international/2016/11/23/new-oliver-stone-documentary-blames-us-for-ukrainian-revolutions_650433 ) edward snowden and many others . 
  russia did not want the coalition to succeed in iraq . 
  it was putin in 2003 who used his unsc veto to block un authorization for iraq . 
  ever since then , russia has sought to undermine the effort , both militarily ( through iranian and syrian proxies ) and democratically ( through its support of people like assange , stein , corbyn and trump ) . 
  because he , trump and the green party are all just tools of russian diplomacy , or useful idiots who have been used as such . 
  he 's not a right-winger . 
  unless the green party is right wing . 
  and he was a propagandist even back then . 
  on the same day his people in iceland released that `` collateral murder '' video , the military released the records of two investigations already conducted , which found no criminality because the civilians ( reuters reporters ) were in the company of armed insurgents with rpg launchers , which the leaked video was manipulated not to reveal . 
   in 2010 , julian assange assembled a team in iceland for several months and jonsdottir helped to produce the `` collateral murder '' video - leaked footage of a us air strike that resulted in civilian deaths . 
  she says she cut ties with the group shortly after , however . 
  she also recently said it had `` gone too far '' when asked about allegations that assange interfered with the us election on norwegian television . 
  i 'm curious about what she believes makes that `` too far . '', 
  close - cato institute . 
  the ksa 's un delegation represents its monarchy . 
  generally , whatever strengthens the monarchy weakens the religious establishment . 
  the saudi government is controlled by the monarchy , but most aspects of justice fall under the jurisdiction of the religious establishment , which is separate and often opposed to the monarchy . 
  he did n't accuse the saudi royal family . 
  he just said saudis , and the monarchy in saudi arabia is n't in charge of religious matters . 
  and this is good . 
  it may seem a breach of protocol , but this is what western nations need these days : public officials who not only realize what we 're dealing with but clarify it for the public . 
  the source is irrelevant . 
  this happens everywhere . 
  you hear about us because we have 300 million people and that makes us a big mirror for everyone 's national ego . 
  to germans we 're warmongers , to russians atheists , to chinese weak , to japanese lazy , to french ignorant , to scandinavians intolerant . 
  whatever you need as an antithesis , that 's what we are . 
  that is the comment that spawned this thread , yes . 
   every time i hear about `` camps '' or `` schools '' meant to help troubled kids ( or gay conversion etc ) that turn out to be abusive and counterproductive it 's in the us .

  actually , what / u/thecroc said was complete fiction . 
  we have n't banned conversion therapy legally ; we have n't needed to . 
  it 's simply against the common ethical guidelines used by professional psychological organizations in the united states , so it is n't practiced by accredited psychiatrists . 
  only a few states have actual bans . 
  but regardless of whether it 's true or not , 436 upvotes on a comment about how we only ban it because we 're `` weird '' and backward are kind of interesting . 
  i 'd vote for that . 
  * why ?? 
  why ? 
   what several barometers show us is that the inverse happens , intolerance is higher in places with little to no contact . 
  i think it 's more complicated than that . 
  if you have no personal contact with people , you can think of them in a totally abstract way , in either good ways or bad . 
  i 'd expect the lack of a sizable community to have the opposite effect . 
  it 's quite easy to be tolerant when there are no minorities . 
  so how did the cable snap ? 
  [ it happens . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-navy-sailors-iduskcn0wk2v5 ) they 've been flying a lot of sorties . 
   wow . 
  so 80 % of french are pro-putin . 
  if you read [ the links i 've been citing , ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stop-the-war-linked-to-putin-puppets-s6fdwq968 ) you 'd know what i mean . 
  groups like stop the war and politicians like corbyn can be linked directly with the kremlin . 
  and those politicians who opposed it , like schr\u00f6der , are also those who favored closer relations with russia , and who opposed nato expansion out of concern for russia 's interests . 
  i realize it goes against national pride to be told you were played , but you 've been played . 
  putin has been playing all of us since 2000 . 
  it 's good that we 're all starting to become aware of russia 's information warfare , but we 're fools if we think it 's only right-wing nationalists and not left-wing `` anti-imperialists '' who are susceptible . 
  look back at the politics of that time and you 'll discover that the anti-war elements are also the pro-russian elements . 
  all i 'm saying is that that 's not a coincidence . 
  and the same is still true today . 
   we did n't side with putin because he was right , we refused to side with you because bush was wrong , get the difference ? 
  whatever you believe was your reason , you were with putin . 
  and why did putin want to separate france and germany from the uk and us ? 
  [ to divide nato , ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html ) of course . 
  to undermine our alliance . 
  that 's always been the goal , before 1991 and after . 
   ok . chirac was n't left-wing and one could argue schroder was n't either . 
  schr\u00f6der 's party is a member of the socialist international . 
  and you see what i mean ? 
  the left is still convinced that putin was right and that france and germany were right to side with him . 
  at the same time , he goes on far-left american media like democracy now and uses european leftists like [ stop the war ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stop-the-war-linked-to-putin-puppets-s6fdwq968 ) as his tools . 
  it 's not like he can only manipulate one side of politics or the other . 
  but the `` anti-imperialist '' left have always been his most useful idiots . 
  edit : how many people in france even remember that it was putin in 2003 who used his veto to block un authorization for iraq , and got chirac and schr\u00f6der to join him ? 
  same with [ ukraine and georgia . 
  ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html ) it 's the left wing who 's been with him the longest . 
   essentially , both propornot and the european legislators are suspicious of the same thing : narratives that contradict a certain official , accepted , centrist , politically correct line . 
  those narratives , however , have existed for decades , sometimes generations -- since the days when russian propaganda had totally different goals than today , focusing on the support of left-wing movements . 
  this is a misunderstanding . 
  they still focus mainly on leftists and their goal is the same as it 's always been : to discredit , undermine , destabilize and divide the west , and especially nato . 
  in the us , trump and his voters make the most headlines , but the polls consistently show that democratic voters are less supportive of nato than republican voters . 
  it 's still the left that constitute the bulk of russia 's useful idiots . 
  the war began in 1990 and ended in 1991 . 
   in 1992 , saddam hussein asked the us if they 'd be pissed if he attacked kuwait . 
  well , there 's his mistake , then . 
  he should have asked * before * invading . 
  he 's already backtracked on a lot of his campaign positions . 
   america has done pretty freaking well for itself over the last 150 years . 
  * 396 years . 
  but i think most of us would agree that the electoral system needs reform . 
  you realize that democracy in ancient athens meant randomly drawing lots , right ? 
   in the case that usa becomes less interventionist and somewhat more isolationist ( but not fully so , because that would bring the risk of instability to everyone ) ugh , and that 's the problem with this relationship . 
  you want us to be non-interventionist ... but not really . 
  you want us to abandon our neoimperialism and militarism ... but not really . 
  you want us to agree with you ... but not really . 
  if we wanted to dominate europe we would never have supported the eu at all . 
  they were probably expecting obama to back down , given his record in syria , ukraine , etc. , and he kind of did . 
  it has n't been a great win for us . 
  it 's demonstrated both their growing aggressiveness and our weakness . 
   france has twice the gpd of russia . 
  but gdp counts for nothing if you 're [ neutralized by russian diplomacy .
