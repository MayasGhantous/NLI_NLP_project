  they ca n't say it because we currently have an anti-british president , a globalist who does n't believe in empires and would never welcome a union with britain . 
  and the president we just elected is unpredictable and might be insane . 
  there 's no doubt that boris johnson and nick timothy want a union between the uk and us , but our own leaders are n't capable of meeting them halfway . 
  it bothers the third of us who are partisan democrats . 
  as a moderate who would vote for either a bush or a clinton , it does n't bother me at all . 
  obama says a lot of things . 
  subscribe to r/100yearsago and you 'll get a good idea of what it would look like . 
  the warring powers spent every day flaming each other in the press . 
  just read [ page 2 .

  i hope they 're o.k. 
  berlin : #flailingfrance asking britain for help . 
  just look at their casualties . 
  sad !, 
   shirley temple was appointed us ambassador a couple of decades ago . 
  [ that 's not as crazy as it sounds . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shirley_temple#political_career ), 
  he 'll put some **** ing decorum back into your diplomacy . 
  please . 
  i 'm a conservative , and a nationalist . 
  i do n't live in an ivory tower , and i 'm not fond of the left . 
  but i care enough about the truth to try to use words correctly . 
  i do n't understand why you would be involved in politics at all if you do n't . 
  ca n't you guys just play dungeons & dragons and leave politics to the rest of us ? 
  fucking hell , no words * do n't * mean * whatever you want them to mean . 
  * you 're actually arguing that the words you 're using have no meaning ? 
  then why have you been arguing with me about them ? 
  do n't make people force-feed you information . 
  centrism is n't automatically fascism , and clinton is a centrist , not a leftist . 
  if someone combines left social policies and right economic policies , it does not make her a centrist , it would sooner make her a fascist . 
  no it does n't . 
  for fuck 's sake , i do n't normally downvote , but words have meanings . 
  clinton is liberal in her social views and conservative on fiscal and foreign policy . 
  calling her a leftist makes no more sense than to call her a right-winger . 
  she is a centrist . 
   you guys have n't declared war for like god knows how long https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraq_resolution also read the link in the last comment . 
  even without a formal declaration of war , the president ca n't send u.s. troops anywhere without congress 's permission . 
   now tell me . 
  what can congress do about that ? 
  nothing , that 's what . 
  if he actually defies a treaty or refuses to obey a military order ? 
  they can impeach him . 
  [ not true . 
  ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/17/politics/aumf-isis-house-vote-fails-us-troops/ ) in our system , the final authority rests with congress , not the president . 
  only congress can declare war , deploy armed forces , make treaties , etc. 
  [ clinton is a centrist . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_democrats ) as for rabid , no , i think that 's just her personality . 
  saddam was propped up by the soviet union . 
  his entire army was soviet-equipped , and soviet-trained . 
  we only colluded briefly when he was fighting the islamic republic , on the principle of `` the lesser of two evils . '', 
  there were many reasons for the intervention , humanitarian and otherwise , and you may disagree , but blair does seem to believe it was for the greater good , and historians might well agree . 
  certainly , most people would say that about all of his other wars . 
  it was n't random . 
  as long as iran and saudi arabia are fighting their proxy wars of religion , the middle east will never be at peace . 
  american neoconservatives believe that a democratic , secular iraq ( and afghanistan ) is the surest and maybe only route to lasting stability in the region . 
  yes , i think it was justified , and so does / r/kurdistan . 
  that does n't mean bush was right to rely on wmds as a pretext , or to invade without nato 's full support . 
  but imo , the 2003 invasion was 12 years too late . 
  regardless , `` we were against the war because there was no un mandate , '' is n't true . 
  you helped putin block the mandate . 
  [ and some other things . 
  ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html ), 
   we were against the war because there was no un mandate . 
  there was no mandate because schr\u00f6der helped block it . 
  there was no mandate in kosovo either , and schr\u00f6der was 110 % in favor of that . 
   he lied about wmd to invade iraq did he actually ? 
  even france and germany at the time still believed iraq had wmds ; that 's why they favored sanctions , to force disarmament . 
  and those sanctions killed up to a million people in iraq throughout the 1990s , most of them children , and reduced iraq to poverty and ruins , and the left does n't care . 
   at least afghanistan was honest , the usa was angry and hurt after 911 , so they took it out on some helpless poor country . 
  the usa * and * the uk had been at war with iraq throughout the 1990s . 
  blair ordered uk forces to attack iraq [ in 1998 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_iraq_ ( 1998 \\ ) ) from 1992 onward the uk and us intervened in [ operation provide comfort ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_provide_comfort ) and [ operation northern watch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_northern_watch ) to protect iraqi kurds from genocide , and all that was after the gulf war in 1991 . 
  we did n't just decide to invade a country at random because we were angry . 
  how can you even believe that ? 
   the world could either help them do it and earn brownie points , or refuse and anger the world 's most powerful nation . 
  even germany chose the former . 
  germany did nothing to help in iraq . 
  and france ( chirac ) even joined vladimir putin in vetoing authorization for it at the un . 
  and kosovo , and sierra leone , and afghanistan , which just had its first successful democratic transfer of power in its history . 
  and more british have been killed in afghanistan than in iraq , and the left does n't mention or care . 
  this crabs-in-a-bucket culture is disturbing . 
  the left will never forgive blair for essentially being a centrist who subscribes to the idea of [ humanitarian interventionism . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tony_blair#military_intervention_and_the_war_on_terror ) why ? 
  there are much worse kinds of politicians than that . 
   the west can only install corrupt puppets that 'll fall as soon as the west pulls its troops out , the history of japan , south korea , taiwan , india , philippines , singapore , etc. , and for that matter germany , proves this to be false . 
   traditional clan based-societies can only function by authoritarian leaders there 's no difference between this and saying , `` arabs ca n't govern themselves , they 're brute beasts and they need the lash ! '', 
   following the invasion , iraq is in a worse condition than it has ever been . 
  iraqi kurdistan is better off than it 's ever been . 
  and afghanistan is too . 
  and what 's the difference between iraq and afghanistan ? 
  maybe it 's that in afghanistan , our allies actually helped and we did n't give up halfway through ? 
  it 's not an authorization for war . 
  it 's a declaration of war . 
  at that point , the united states is at war . 
  and giving aid to its enemies is treason . 
  granted there 's some room for interpretation about treason but section 8 also gives congress the authority to `` call forth the militia , '' to `` define and punish offenses against the law of nations , '' to `` make rules for the government of the land and naval forces , '' etc. 
   well , it * can * do anything it wants in the sense that it can put out a piece of paper saying `` respond to the attack on an ally '' . 
  article i , section 8 gives congress and * only * congress the authority to declare war . 
  any president who refuses to combat our enemies during a state of war is guilty of treason under article iii , section 3 , and can be removed under article ii , section 4 .
