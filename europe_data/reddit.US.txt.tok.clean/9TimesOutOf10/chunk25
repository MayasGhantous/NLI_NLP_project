  are you actually arguing that a declaration of war is just a suggestion , and that the president has the authority to wage war against congress 's authority ? 
  u/old _ faraon, 
   checks and balances [ special thanks : le baron de montesquieu . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montesquieu ), 
   that 's article i , section 8 that you 're looking for : i stand corrected . 
  but you 're leaving a bit out . 
  congress has the power :  10 : to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas , and offences against the law of nations ;  11 : to declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and make rules concerning captures on land and water ;  12 : to raise and support armies , but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years ;  13 : to provide and maintain a navy ;  14 : to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ;  15 : to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union , suppress insurrections and repel invasions ;  16 : to provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining , the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states , reserving to the states respectively , the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress ;  17 : to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such district ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may , by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of congress , become the seat of the government of the united states , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings ; -- and  18 : to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states , or in any department or officer thereof . 
  the president 's job is to execute that authority , hence * executive branch . 
  * if he refuses to do that , he can be replaced . 
  ( previous comment deleted to save clutter ) you 're just being stubborn . 
  article ii , section 8 explicitly gives congress and not the president control over the use and even the existence of the military . 
  the question of whether the war powers act is constitutional has to do with whether it 's constitutional to grant such powers to the president even by act of congress . 
  no one would ever question whether it 's constitutional for congress itself to exercise them . 
  sorry but no , congress is totally in control . 
  because of the changing nature of war , congress passed the war powers act allowing the president to deploy troops to combat for up to 60 days without a congressional vote , but he ca n't stop congress from voting and * if * congress votes , that 's the end of it . 
  it is , and it was then , but they do n't agree with trump at all : http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-nato-new-york-times-225942, 
  [ u.s. troop deployments are decided by congress . 
  ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/17/politics/aumf-isis-house-vote-fails-us-troops/ ) and congress voted 98 % to supply ukraine despite obama 's opposition . 
  i really ca n't see any conceivable way we 'll be withdrawing from the baltics , regardless of what trump might want . 
  on the other hand , if we actually had a good relationship , then as the guy in the article mentioned , we could n't be used to create a siege mentality and justify acts of aggression . 
   do n't fuck us on this , frenchies , we 've had a shitty enough year already . 
  do n't listen , frenchies . 
  embrace the dark side !, 
  complete your training !, 
  why do they hate him so much for iraq , and not for afghanistan , kosovo and sierra leone ? 
  do you think the united states wanted iran to colonize iraq ? 
  of course that was n't the intended outcome . 
  the point is n't to weaken iran but to prevent the iranians from exporting theocracy into iraq ( and afghanistan ) . 
  as long as iran and saudi arabia are fighting their shia/sunni ideological wars , the middle east will never be at peace . 
  american neoconservatives believe that stable democracy in iraq and afghanistan is the surest and maybe only route to lasting stability in the region . 
  it 's also the same reason we supported the [ previous government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_revolution#reforms ) in iran . 
  shah mohammed was n't much of a democrat , but he was secular and progressive , and the rest would have taken care of itself . 
  iran at that time was the best hope for peace and democracy in the middle east , before the islamic revolution took over . 
  and what do the snowden leaks and your article , and [ this one ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar ) , all have in common ? 
  the guardian is as committed to its point of view as the daily mail is , and no less dishonest . 
   iran has been strengthened thanks to the invasion . 
  after saddam was ousted the new government were basically iranian puppets . 
  so your statement is completely untrue . 
  it does n't take much insight to realize that that 's not the outcome that was intended . 
  held its first elections in 2015 , but yes , a democratic iraq would be a much better ally than an ultra-conservative ksa . 
   or why do you think the war was started ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5dyt4u/tony_blair_returning_to_politics_because_he/da8rcoj/ it started in 1992 , but then was on the back burner throughout the 1990s . 
  we engaged in limited operations like [ operation haven ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_provide_comfort ) ( began as a british initiative ) and [ operation northern watch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_northern_watch ) to help defend the kurdish minority , but conflicts in europe and elsewhere prevented full-scale liberation until 2003 . 
  the reasons are complex but really have little to do with oil as far as our interest is concerned . 
  ours is more about stability , especially preventing iran from exporting its revolution , for which a secular , democratic and pro-western iraq would be a vital ally . 
   https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/20/iraq-war-oil-resources-energy-peak-scarcity-economy the guardian is the left 's daily mail and anything in it has to be read with skepticism . 
   constant western intermeddling from the coup in persia 1953 [ it started rather earlier than that . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_history_of_syria#world_war_ii_and_the_founding_of_the_un ) france was bombing syria during the un 's founding conference in san francisco . 
  france created syria . 
  the uk created iraq and pakistan , and italy created libya . 
   western armement of sadam hussein in the 80s , his entire military was soviet-equipped and soviet-trained , except for his air force , which was half french , and his chemical wmds , which were german . 
  and it was the soviets who supported the islamic revolution in iran , and it was the soviets who invaded afghanistan , and the soviets and later russians who supported assad . 
  and russia today sells arms to [ all sides involved . 
  ] ( http://uawire.org/news/russia-and-saudi-arabia-reach-10-billion-arms-deal ) basically what i 'm saying is that this is a more complicated story than you 're making it . 
  `` because of western meddling '' is just as wrong as the most naive propaganda . 
  i though it had something to do with the region being full of undemocratic regimes and continuous wars of religion , but i could be wrong . 
  the `` war for oil '' myth was one our left was equally fond of . 
  i guess it could mean that we invaded for british oil , but did n't get any . 
   for oil http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1948787,00.html, 
   why should we sacrifice our soldiers just that the us can have another unstable puppetstate ? 
  maybe because iraq is n't a puppet state ? 
  they ordered us to leave years ago and we did , remember ? 
  they 're a sovereign and democratic state , and iran probably has more influence with them than we do . 
  this , basically , is what i was pointing out in my first comment , this lack of self-criticism : `` all of the members knew that the us was there to make money , for nothing else . '', 
  that 's not what happened . 
  and not only did france * not * help , chirac ( and putin ) actually used their unsc veto to obstruct the un from helping . 
  i 'm not a trump voter , but it 's not crazy to believe that countries who sabotage us politically and contribute nothing to our own defense might not be worth having as allies . 
  [ he subscribes to the idea of humanitarian interventionism . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tony_blair#military_intervention_and_the_war_on_terror ) that 's far from the worst kind of warmonger . 
  and the era of adding * neo * to perfectly applicable words continues . 
  in the article , the reason they gave for blocking it was that protecting georgia and ukraine would have been `` an unnecessary offense to russia . '', 
  germany and france are now freaking out over the possibility that we might sacrifice eastern europeans for russian friendship , which is the same thing they did , twice , not long ago . 
  france and germany also sided with putin against us in iraq , when we really could have used their support , and so could kurds . 
  it was putin ( and chirac ) who used their veto to block un authorization . 
  whatever you think about that decision , it was important . 
  it 's not like our `` different opinions '' are trivial, 
   i did n't accuse them , you said :  you 're a british person , it 's your right to say whether or not the government should abandon other allied members in times of need because the eu did n't give uk what it wo n't give any other country . 
  so if they think being entitled to no more than `` any other country '' means it 's time to look elsewhere for allies , then you 're accusing them of abandoning you . 
  all i 'm saying is that the eu actually does have a choice about its relationships with other powers , including the uk . 
  but you * are * asking for favors . 
  in your first comment , you accused them of abandoning allies ( you ) in your time of need . 
  so you want them as allies and you expect them to defend you if needed , but you do n't want to offer them a favorable trade arrangement . 
  the eu has a choice . 
  it has to decide whether the friendship of the uk is worth less than the possible danger of setting a bad precedent . 
  i do n't know which is the right choice , but there is a choice . 
  no , it 's not just just the british who are choosing . 
  in the article , eu officials are saying that they 're choosing not to offer the british a good deal . 
  it 's not like they do n't have a choice . 
  they 're choosing this . 
   `` it looks like it is now just germany and canada holding down the western world , '' an elected politician from one of germany 's prosperous western states told me over dinner this week . 
  i started to laugh , but he put up his hand -- he was being serious . 
  he launched into a depressing tour of the countries once known as the group of eight , most of them sliding into chaos or extremism or long-term political paralysis . 
   at the head of the table , the united states is weeks away from falling off the political map , as far as its trade and military partners are concerned : yes ... our [ trade ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-usa-ttip-iduskcn11n0h6 ) and [ military ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html ) partners ... 
  in all honesty , i think this is the end of britain 's involvement with the european union . 
  after several years of being told they 're irrelevant garbage , they 're going to be disgusted enough with europe that they wo n't want anything to do with it and the anglosphere will steal them away . 
  there 's also an article on the second page about the german military liberating jews in occupied poland . 
  [ forgot to cite it . 
  ] ( http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/wilsonwar.htm ) it 's from an article first published in 1924 . 
  he * really * did n't want to . 
   i 'd never seen him so worn down .
