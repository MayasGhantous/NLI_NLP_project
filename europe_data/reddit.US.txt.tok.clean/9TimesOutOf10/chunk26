  he looked as if he had n't slept , and he said he had n't . 
  he said he was probably going before congress the next day to ask a declaration of war , and he 'd never been so uncertain about anything in his life as about that decision . 
  for nights , he said , he 'd been lying awake going over the whole situation - over the provocation given by germany , over the probable feeling in the united states , over the consequences to the settlement and to the world at large if we entered the melee . 
   ...  it would mean that we should lose our heads along with the rest and stop weighing right and wrong . 
  it would mean that a majority of people in this hemisphere would go war-mad , quit thinking , and devote their energies to destruction . 
   ...  he said when a war got going it was just war , and there were n't two kinds of it . 
  it required illiberalism at home to reinforce the men at the front . 
  we could n't fight germany and maintain the ideals of government that all thinking men shared . 
  he said we would try it , but it would be too much for us . 
   ` once lead this people into war , ' he said , ` and they 'll forget there ever was such a thing as tolerance . 
  to fight you must be brutal and ruthless , and the spirit of ruthless brutality will enter into the very fiber of our national life , infecting congress , the courts , the policeman on the beat , the man in the street . ', 
  conformity would be the only virtue , said the president , and every man who refused to conform would have to pay the penalty . 
   he thought the constitution would not survive it , that free speech and the right of assembly would go . 
  he said a nation could n't put its strength into a war and keep its head level ; it had never been done . 
   ` if there is any alternative , for god 's sake , let 's take it , ' he exclaimed . 
  well , i could n't see any , and i told him so . 
  edit : [ source ] ( http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/wilsonwar.htm ), 
  you do n't think he makes a fair point about north america ? 
  canada/us/mexico all have free trade with each other and will have free trade with the uk . 
  for that matter , the eu has free trade with canada/mexico , but not with the uk ? 
  [ japan was doing pretty well , ] ( http://www.oldtokyo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/nihonbashi-bridge-trolleys-color-300.jpg ) too . 
  and china , but political crisis got in the way . 
  context : wilson won the electoral college 277-254 . 
  on page 4 , `` why wilson won , '' it was apparently because republicans `` could n't believe there was any real danger '' and `` refused to think - or worry , '' and because wilson understands that voters `` look to something beyond mere dollars . '', 
  also , on page 2 , norwegians and swedes are designing a giant `` air liner , '' competing with count von zeppelin in germany . 
   every country has always looked after its own interests above all , but not exclusively . 
  besides , global security is in everyone 's interest . 
   i just do n't understand how these obvious crooks keep fooling the american people . 
  that is indicative of the problem : you do n't understand the american people , and they do n't understand you either . 
  and there 's no communication , only demonization and convincing ourselves that the opposing side is corrupt , evil and stupid . 
  case in point : your quotation . 
  dan baum said in 2015 that john ehrlichman ( a convicted perjurer , died in 1999 ) told him those words 23 years ago , and you automatically assume that he did in fact say that , and that he was speaking non-sarcastically and that it does accurately reflect nixon 's policy and that of his whole administration , even though other top nixon officials who are still alive deny that the words reflect either ehrlichman 's views or the administration 's . 
  why ? 
   somehow the same people that complain about americas involvement in german politics find it absolutely ok if russia does the same . 
  somehow ? 
  i think i can understand right-wing extremists and religious terrorists well enough , but i really do n't understand communists like these . 
  so you do n't want to accept that you as a civil body politic are responsible for your political problems . 
  fine . 
  but why take it out on innocent police officers trying to guard an embassy ? 
  that 's the part that i do n't get . 
  edit : typo, 
  we went from safe spaces and trigger warnings to fascism in less than one year . 
  usa # 1 social dynamism . 
  because his version of a western alliance is us as the uk 's clone army . 
  fuck that . 
  we know how that ends . 
  i understand british conservatives want to continue wielding power through the anglosphere , but in that case they should think about forming a federal union with us like boris johnson wants to , instead of prolonging an alliance that ca n't last . 
  i ca n't help thinking that he 's stuck in 1945 . 
  he opposes an eu military because it will get in the way of `` western unity . '', 
  that 's not a very forward-looking idea of unity . 
  i guess we should be grateful that the internet did n't exist back then , or that might never have happened . 
  life is becoming reddit . 
  people vote up opinions they like , and vote down opinions they do n't like . 
  it 's a serious threat to a civil body politic . 
  it would be more accurate to say that his chief strategist has been accused of sympathizing with white nationalists : http://www.snopes.com/2016/11/14/steve-bannon-accused-of-having-white-supremacist-views/ imo / u/cocojumbo123 is right - trump is a man without serious opinions . 
  and congress , state department , dod , etc. , all have theirs , so i do n't expect much to change . 
  you 're falling for classic disinformation . 
  support for undemocratic governments does n't mean we do n't care about human rights . 
  we often support them * because * we care . 
  it 's because we supported dictatorial governments in taiwan and south korea that they are free and democratic now , when mainland china and north korea are n't . 
  stability comes before democracy . 
  and from your examples : iraq is a democracy now , afghanistan is a democracy now , and saudi arabia held its first elections in 2015 . 
   the west was constituted in its modern form in january 1917 . 
  world war i was raging in europe at the time and in washington , d.c. , president woodrow wilson told his country that it was time for americans to take responsibility for `` peace and justice . '', 
  in april he said : `` the world must be made safe for democracy . '', 
  sigh , what we have lost . 
  these days , if a president said that , he would be called a warmongering imperialist . 
  if germans want the job , they can certainly have it , but they should be aware that it will mean having blood on their hands . 
  no one has ever been powerful and innocent at the same time . 
   just go read the goddam article on ussr economy on wikipedia , [ lend-lease ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lend-lease ) article :  roughly 17.5 million tons of military equipment , vehicles , industrial supplies , and food were shipped from the western hemisphere to the ussr , 94 % coming from the us . 
  for comparison , a total of 22 million tons landed in europe to supply american forces from january 1942 to may 1945 . 
  it has been estimated that american deliveries to the ussr through the persian corridor alone were sufficient , by us army standards , to maintain ** sixty combat divisions ** in the line . 
   the united states gave to the soviet union from october 1 , 1941 to may 31 , 1945 the following : 427,284 trucks , 13,303 combat vehicles , 35,170 motorcycles , 2,328 ordnance service vehicles , 2,670,371 tons of petroleum products ( gasoline and oil ) or ** 57.8 percent of the high-octane aviation fuel , ** 4,478,116 tons of foodstuffs ( canned meats , sugar , flour , salt , etc. 
  ) , 1,911 steam locomotives , 66 diesel locomotives , 9,920 flat cars , 1,000 dump cars , 120 tank cars , and 35 heavy machinery cars . 
  provided ordnance goods ( ammunition , artillery shells , mines , assorted explosives ) amounted to ** 53 percent of total domestic production . 
  ** one item typical of many was a tire plant that was lifted bodily from the ford company 's river rouge plant and transferred to the ussr . 
  the 1947 money value of the supplies and services amounted to about ** eleven billion dollars . 
   the warrant was allegedly granted based on actionable intelligence provided by a friendly intelligence service on vladimir putin 's own daughters . 
  thanks , mi6 . 
  read the article ? 
   the guardian  ` we need strong american leadership ' ok , 2016 , now you 're scaring me . 
  part of the reason i posted this is because i feel that people do n't have a good understanding of boris johnson . 
  they just dismiss him as a rudderless buffoon , when he actually seems to have a very firm grounding in history and politics . 
  shame that it got voted down . 
  it also says that obama 's been criticized for not believing in it . 
  anyway , [ he wants nothing to do with the world order as far as the middle east is concerned . 
  ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/ ), 
  that 's the point . 
  another name : nigel farage . 
  i think our main problem is that we 've been infected by anti-americanism . 
  of course we have a lot going for us . 
  we represent 22 % of the world 's gdp . 
  we have a higher average income than the eu and a higher life expectancy , the world 's strongest military , the world 's most pervasive culture . 
  we 've created a society that combines total freedom of expression with one of the highest levels of [ social cohesion ] ( http://www.bfna.org/media_advisory/u-s-social-cohesion-high-unaffected-by-immigration ) in the world . 
  and we actually did bring democracy to iraq and afghanistan , and many others . 
  but most americans believe pretty much the opposite . 
   was n't american exceptionalism a dogma ? 
  [ that 's a term that can mean several things . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_exceptionalism ), 
  eh , it was never supposed to be .
