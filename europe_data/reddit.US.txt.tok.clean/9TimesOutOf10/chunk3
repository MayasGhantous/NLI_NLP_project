  get on with it . '' another former minister said : `` nick is quite charming when you get to know him but he might be seen as ruthless . '' inside the home office , mr timothy would irritate some by putting his feet on the table . 
  a former colleague said that he felt mr timothy was reluctant to listen . 
  sometimes if there were late-night press queries , he would send intemperate emails . 
  another said : `` he may not be as bright as he thinks he is . 
  everybody who disagrees with him is not only wrong but an idiot . '' downing street said that the criticisms of his character by former colleagues were `` simply untrue '' . 
  mr timothy had run-ins with no 10 while at the home office . 
  six months before last year 's general election , his name was removed from the list of candidates standing in a safe tory seat because of irritation that he had failed to campaign for the party in the rochester by-election , which was won by mark reckless of ukip after his defection from the conservatives . 
  dr lawlor said : `` i thought that was disgraceful , i really did . 
  they need able people like that and he was also very nice and modest . 
  this is a superior person . 
  there is no side to him at all . 
  he is intelligent and robust . '' however , a former colleague said : `` everyone was mobilised to do some canvassing and he refused . 
  it was beneath him . '' mr timothy 's brother john was meanwhile building a career as a political lobbyist . 
  after leaving university , he worked for the british israel communications and research centre . 
  for some years he has lobbied for tesco , at one time serving as its head of uk government relations . 
  it 's not all work for nick timothy , though . 
  he is engaged to marry nike torst , an official at the financial conduct authority . 
  he has also become a trustee of action against abduction , the charity founded by lady meyer after she was forcibly separated from her two children . 
  `` he really wants to make a difference , '' she said . 
  her husband sir christopher , the former ambassador to washington , said mr timothy was interested in `` the 19th century european congress system after the napoleonic wars , from which britain withdrew and then returned , so there are lessons to be learnt about the balance of relationships between european powers for today 's situation . '' and today when mrs may speaks , she mouths mr timothy 's thoughts . 
  in her first utterance as prime minister , she championed families whose lives were harder than many in westminster realised ; people worrying about getting children into a good school and white working-class boys less likely than anybody to go to university . 
  a former colleague of her adviser 's said : `` when she looked at the camera in downing street and made that speech i thought : it 's pure nick . '' another of her early comments as prime minister echoed mr timothy 's praise for chamberlain 's measures against `` unscrupulous bosses '' . 
  mrs may branded jeremy corbyn an `` unscrupulous boss '' . 
  chamberlain held high office but never entered no 10 . 
  a tory mp said of the statesman in 1906 that `` the conservative party will not be led by a bloody radical '' . 
  mrs may 's administration , though , is being guided by one . 
  and , as mr timothy tells visitors to downing street : `` we have only just got going . '', 
  not if the public comes around . 
  clinton is n't really opposed it . 
  she just has to appease some luddites first , the same story as in europe . 
  she 'll sign it eventually . 
  did you see his party conference speech this year ? 
  have you read anything he 's written ? 
  yes ? 
  the man is certainly intelligent and often brilliant . 
  no , it was about great issues ; it became pointless later . 
  but it 's not `` britain alone '' they 're going for . 
  it 's seemed pretty evident ever since may appointed nick timothy her advisor and boris johnson her foreign secretary and name-dropped [ joseph chamberlain ] ( http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/the-man-theresa-may-wants-to-be/ ) that they 're aiming for another union outside the eu . 
  british pessimism is amazing . 
  you just pointed out that your foreign minister speaks at least seven languages in the course of calling him an embarrassment . 
  well , i 'm not objecting to nato , but to this homogenizing idea of `` the west , '' the thing dugin is talking about . 
  holding territory is something the russian military is better at than taking it . 
  it 's been specializing in a2ad for years and has the best anti-aircraft missiles in the world . 
  any attempt to retake territory held by russia would involve a long , grinding war of attrition , the kind of war russia usually wins . 
  it probably would n't . 
  russia would n't use nuclear weapons unless it was facing an `` existential '' defeat , i.e. 
  the conquest of russia , and that wo n't happen because nato could never hope to successfully invade it . 
  to be honest , russians believing that russia is neither east nor west is just a recognition of their own uniqueness . 
  russia is a multiethnic eurasian nation . 
  i often wish we could do the same . 
  meaning no offense , but north american nations are n't european nations , and neither should necessarily try to be like the other . 
  ... was that an exalted reference ? 
  according to [ this , ] ( http://www.afocr.org/wilson-monument-and-tg-masaryk-memorial ) my history was somewhat off : it was still a plaster mould until 1968 , when it was cast in bronze , and then hidden away during the warsaw pact invasion along with an identical copy . 
  dc is full of [ japanese cherries ] ( http://www.nanoasiandining.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cherryblossoms-aprilblog-1000x444.jpg ) due to an ambassador 's gift way back , which makes the month of april the best time to take photos . 
  you must be right about his appearance , because [ the informational display ] ( http://www.dcmemorials.com/img//0001000//01582_0000017370.jpg ) near it actually does mention that he had a great body as well as a great mind . 
  xd the statue itself was actually sculpted in czechoslovakia before masaryk 's death , then disappeared during ww2 and was eventually rediscovered in a warehouse somewhere and donated by the czech government . 
  [ masaryk monument in dc . 
  ] ( http://st2.depositphotos.com/1029775/5802/i/950/depositphotos_58022617-washington-statue-of-tomas-masaryk.jpg ) i used to live not far from it . 
  sorry for the [ watermark , ] ( http://depositphotos.com/58022617/stock-photo-washington-statue-of-tomas-masaryk.html ) but it had to be a photo with the cherry trees in bloom . 
  there 's some truth to it in that putin seems to feel [ personally disrespected ] ( http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/clinton-putin-226153 ) by clinton , for example , but the idea that he and guys like lavrov and shuvanov are actually worried about invasion is beyond ridiculous . 
  because i do n't really want to argue about it . 
  not enough . 
  he knows perfectly well that 's not what happened . 
  the coalition did n't impose democracy on anyone . 
  kurds were already * de facto * independent and the current leadership in baghdad had been lobbying for liberation for years while in exile . 
  all the coalition did was help them get rid of a genocidal tyrant and restore their own democracy . 
  and it was putin who undermined that effort in 2003 when he vetoed un authorization for the liberation , because he thought he saw an opportunity to split france and germany off from america and britain and drive a wedge through nato , thereby enabling his own adventures . 
  amazingly , yes . 
  [ finland ] ( http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2016/economies/#economy=fin ) gets a perfect score of 1.0 for `` women in ministerial positions , '' even with women outnumbering men almost 2 to 1 . 
  you only lose points if you have more men than women , not if you have more women than men . 
  sometimes i wonder if 90 % of these international rankings are produced in scandinavia . 
  well , not exactly a myth , but the trend has [ reversed ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/more-mexican-immigrants-leaving-us-than-entering-report-finds.html?_r=0 ) in recent years . 
  that 's a myth . 
  more illegal immigrants have left the country over the last few years than are entering it . 
  the migrant population is decreasing . 
  actually , i 'm taking a nationalist and anti-globalist position . 
  globalists do n't believe in nations competing and they do n't particularly care if the us remains a superpower . 
  they want a future in which nations become irrelevant . 
  for non-globalists , there 's more to consider than `` quality of life . '', 
  right now , for example , the american film and television industry [ is beginning to self-censor itself ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26lc7anjeg ) in order to [ present china in a positive light . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usqdlc5i5yo ) the reason is population : the chinese box office is about to become larger than the american box office . 
  pretty soon , hollywood will be making more money in china than they make in america , which means our films will be made more for chinese audiences than for american audiences , and will cater to chinese points of view , not american , and all because our population is n't large enough to compete . 
   europe has its own distinct culture , it does n't need other cultures . 
  america has created its own distinct culture ; we do n't need an injection of other cultures . 
  how does mass immigration preserve our national identity * at all ? 
  * because our position is the opposite of europe 's . 
  consider how much more multilingual americans were 100 years ago than they are today . 
  our national identity weakens in the absence of immigration , not as a consequence of it . 
  well , hopefully you live in a democracy and will have a say in the matter . 
   i 'm not sure if the people who suffered through those war zones in american cities would agree with that . 
  they would n't be impartial observers , would they ? 
  i mean , really ? 
  an american is arguing that people should n't have been allowed to immigrate to america ? 
  i have difficulty believing you 're being serious . 
  china has four times our population . 
  even europe has twice our population . 
  without immigration , america is n't even going to be a second-tier power in the future world order . 
  we need people , and we need inexpensive labor , and we need to preserve our national identity . 
  immigration accomplishes all three . 
  i would basically agree with that .
