  i updated the last comment with a link . 
  that 's ... not a correct estimate . 
  but again , go ahead and compare black to black . 
  i know black canadians are more over-incarcerated than black americans . 
  i 'm on my phone but that 's easy enough to confirm . 
  edit : http://torontoist.com/2016/04/african-canadian-prison-population/, 
  because aboriginal canadians make up about the same % of the population as black americans . 
  they 're canada 's largest ethnic minority . 
  very few canadians are black . 
  but if you want to compare black canadians to black americans , go ahead . 
  [ meanwhile in reddit 's favorite country ... ] ( https://spatialitism.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/charts_mac04-gilmore.jpeg ), 
  we have 20 % of the world 's immigrant population ... 
  he was being pretty unfair there . 
  the tsar at the time was alexander the liberator , who abolished serfdom and later helped the union during the civil war . 
  and the war of independence was a very long time ago . 
  you might as well expect our opinions to be based on napoleon iii 's invasion of mexico .

  that 's not the best example . 
  80 % of germans support same-sex marriage and it 's still not legal in germany , largely because of pr . 
  only 64 % of americans support it , and it is legal . 
  i 'm not saying pr does n't have any advantages but it 's not what this campaign makes it out to be . 
  you are missing the point . 
  a large number of parties does n't mean a large number of actual possibilities . 
  geert wilders will never be pm and neither will nick clegg . 
  meanwhile donald trump was able to become president even though the republican establishment hated him , because of fptp and a two-party system , and on the other side we had socialist bernie sanders neck and neck with neoliberal clinton . 
  several comments above this , u/caeppers is upvoted for stating that if russia/germany/turkey / venezuela had fptp , their leaders would have an even bigger lead - something that goes against all mathematical models . 
  this is just a straightforward denial of science . 
  yes , and they said the same thing about putin , erdogan and chavez . 
  and ,  if those countries had fptp the only change would be that the parties of those leaders would have more seats in parliament . 
  that 's unlikely . 
  fptp leads almost inevitably to a two-party system . 
  having a leader no one can challenge is almost impossible . 
  edit : oh no , political science , better vote it down . 
  it 's not hard to see the connection . 
  pr ensures that parties are represented , which is different from voters being represented . 
  within the same party , there is at least the possibility of an upset . 
  with pr , minority viewpoints are placed in their own parties and essentially quarantined from power . 
  merkel will remain chancellor because no one can actually challenge her . 
   most developed democracies already use proportional representation yes , including : * russia !, 
  * turkey !, 
  * venezuela !, 
  * germany !, 
  join the club , uk . 
  you too can have the same pm for the next 15 years thanks to the awesome power of pr in making votes matter . 
  that sense of superiority is really an obstacle imo . 
  corruption ? 
  by our standards , most europeans do n't even have elected leaders . 
  your pm is just whoever the party elites have selected for you after backroom dealing - today theresa may , tomorrow someone else . 
  and it 's the same at the eu level . 
  juncker went from running the world 's largest tax haven to be president of the european commission . 
  and merkel might as well be chancellor for life for all the competition she faces . 
  if we had that system , our president would be jeb bush , but that would hardly make us more democratic . 
  and at least we 're aware of the imperfections of our system , whilst i 'm not sure i can say the same for you and yours . 
  of course it does . 
  i 'm guessing you have n't given it much thought . 
  it would be the major event in our history since the civil war . 
  yeah , me too , actually , but that 's not what i 'm doing . 
  if i were telling them what they wanted to hear , i 'd be upvoted , not downvoted . 
  members of this sub downvoted that comment because they hate the idea of the us stealing the uk from the eu , but i 'm totally in favor . 
  would you care to explain that ? 
   that does n't dispute my argument , as congress has to pass a law ( eg a treaty ) to do any of that . 
  a resolution is sufficient . 
   even moreso , my point was that the president has the ability to remove forces at any time without consulting congress at all period , whereas the text you posted again dealt primarily with troop deployments . 
  only because of the war powers resolution , passed by congress , which congress can revoke . 
  the authority belongs to congress . 
  for the most part it 's just phonetic . 
  they 'd find some chinese words that vaguely sound like the native words , although it does n't necessarily make any sense . 
  france -  fa guo , `` law country '' england -  ying guo , `` brave country '', 
  i 'm more worried about the uk honestly . 
  in a strange and tragic way i think the uk and us each have what the other needs . 
  we have the modern empire you want , and you have the opportunity for expansion we need to end our post-cold-war malaise . 
  but anglo countries just are n't good at forming postnational unions . 
  it 's not just a budgetary issue . 
  article i , section 8 of the constitution invests the power of war and peace solely in congress ( incidentally , that 's the meaning of the olive branch and arrows held in the eagle 's claws on our national seal ) . 
  congress alone has the authority `` to declare war , '' `` to raise and support armies , '' `` to call forth the militia , '' `` to provide and maintain a navy , '' `` to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces , '' and so forth : http://www.shmoop.com/constitution/article-1-section-8.html, 
   he , as president , has the unquestionable authority to remove all american military and diplomatic forces from ukraine right now without consulting anybody . 
  ditto for turkey , iraq , syria and israel . 
  it looks that way in the foreign media , but in reality [ congress is the final authority on all troop deployments ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/17/politics/aumf-isis-house-vote-fails-us-troops/index.html ) and if the president does n't comply he can be removed . 
  the senate did . 
  the house of representatives still has to vote on it before it becomes official . 
  because you were so angry and verbose that it took you that long to compose your reply . 
  and the only thing i removed at all was an observation that your vapid opinions were typical in france , which you apparently agree with , so i do n't see what you 're complaining about . 
   i did n't even bother to launch the video . 
  `` i do n't know what you 're saying , so i 'm just going to rant at you . '', 
   btw that 's pretty lame to insult somebody , and then remove the insult to make somebody looks worse than he/she is . 
  i edited it hours before you replied , not as some deception but because i did n't want to carry on that argument . 
   everybody despise murican evengalical mission to bomb everyone for freedom , in france . 
  yep , and [ this is why . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iooo_v9anmw&amp;t=20m13s ), 
   the uk by itself does n't worth much on geopolitics , it just does n't need carriers . 
  it will be a good sign of allegeance to the usa tho , wherever next murican war is . 
  the uk intervened in sierra leone without the us , in yugoslavia and libya before the us ( and with a ground invasion in yugoslavia , which the us did n't do ) , in afghanistan and iraq in coalition with the us , and would have intervened in more places since if the last two had gone more smoothly - blair was planning on it . 
  they really do n't seem to understand it . 
  they do the same things with trump , like trying to ban him from visiting the uk , and it makes me - someone who personally hates trump - defend him because of their ridiculously insolent behavior . 
  in boston , a group of british soldiers opened fire on protesters , killing 5 americans . 
  8 soldiers were charged , but were acquitted ( 2 with reduced sentences ) because the trial revealed that the protesters had provoked them by throwing stones and other objects . 
  the lawyer for their defense was john adams , eventually our 2nd president . 
  12 of his bodyguards have been charged with assault in dc . 
  2 americans and 2 canadians have also been charged .
