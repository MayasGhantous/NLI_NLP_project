  someday reddit 's going to discover that canadian kids start every school day singing the national anthem . 
  edit : george washington made the same argument in his farewell speech . 
  without it , we 'd be a mass of squabbling states held together only by bureaucracy . 
  can you guys do anything without us ? 
  [ for context ] ( http://www.citylab.com/politics/2016/08/foreign-fighters-isis/493622/ ), 
  it 's the business strategy of newspaper websites in 2017 : 1 . 
  the apocalypse is upon us !!!, 
  subscribe to read . 
  i 'm starting to think that all companies associated with newspapers , magazines and other relics of print media should just close down for good , because their death throes are becoming damaging to civil society . 
  the question was , what could iraq do if france did this without their permssion ? 
  sure it is . 
  total is pumping oil out of halfaya under contract by the oil ministry in baghdad . 
  without the oil ministry 's permission , that does n't happen . 
   who cares if we violate the airspace of iraq or lebanon in the process ? 
  what are they going to do to us , bring the issue to the un ? 
  gon na veto it . 
  shoot down our planes ? 
  ` gon na nuke them back to the stone age . 
  so it 's not an issue . 
  how will your oil companies like being locked out overnight ? 
  if you know very little about it , what makes you say he 's a badass ? 
  and what has he done in opposition to trump or putin ? 
   they 're proud but fragile -- eager to find offense . 
  this comment has hurt the feelings of the chinese people . 
  all of our handsomest politicians agree . 
   it seems like most americans took my first comment personally , i do not mean to offend you , i 'm just discussing . 
  to be honest i find your comment more insulting to mexico than to us . 
  you likened it to afghanistan . 
  but i objected because it 's just false - mexico 's neutrality has nothing to do with the drug war , and even your quote does n't say what you 're saying . 
  it says we cooperate and share responsibility , which we do . 
  but there are one or two [ other continents ] ( http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1915904-china-is-supplying-a-drug-war-against-the-united-states/ ) besides ours that are contributing to this situation . 
  really ? 
  he had to google your population . 
  he thinks europe is ten times your size . 
  he thinks you 're more war-torn and violent than afghanistan . 
  he thinks we 're responsible for you . 
  he does n't know about the estrada doctrine and thinks mexico is neutral because it 's too fucked up to contribute to un peacekeeping , which is something even central african countries do . 
  he basically thinks mexico is the colostomy bag of our continent . 
  you 're not going to stoop that low just to zing me . 
   what do you mean by that ? 
  i mean it 's incredibly ignorant and self-righteous . 
  and you might want to reread your quotation again , with special attention given to keywords such as :  ** mexico 's ** decade-long war on drugs  american cash and military ** cooperation ** keep downvoting by the way . 
  this is such a swedish redditor comment . 
  do you know mexico is the size of europe ? 
  do you know it has the same population and gdp as russia ? 
  are you honestly imagining mexico to be on the scale of afghanistan ? 
  do you really think my country is responsible for its domestic politics ? 
  personally , i think a more assertive mexico would be a benefit to humanity . 
  really ? 
  mexican neutrality is n't related to drugs . 
  it 's just mexican neutrality . 
  its constitution restricts its military from foreign operations , including un operations . 
  and what we remember about wars is that they preserved our rights , freed us from slavery , etc. 
  this sentiment sounds nice but is n't universally accurate , i think . 
  ... which is the same thing you say to everyone who asks for your help . 
  you guys would n't even do un peacekeeping until 2014 . 
  reposted because edit : if you read that article , it seems that terrorism in europe is more about assimilation than anything else . 
  muslim europeans do n't feel accepted in their society , so they learn to hate it instead . 
  it reminds me of some african american leaders like malcom x ( also muslim ) , except more violent . 
  i do n't know what to do about it . 
  it 's a problem only europeans can solve . 
  and you believe them ? 
  again , no one knows how much racial inequality there is in europe , how likely europeans of african descent are to be homeless , in poverty , without an education , etc. 
  we do know this : http://www.citylab.com/politics/2016/08/foreign-fighters-isis/493622/ they produce many more terrorists per capita than muslim americans . 
  two of the countries you mentioned ( sweden , ireland ) are at the top of the list . 
   so you know better about how their country is going than they do ? 
  did n't you just ask me to believe that they know more about how my country is going than i do ? 
  anyway , yeah . 
  swedes and germans have no idea what the real state of immigrants/minorities in their countries is like , because they do n't keep any statistics on it . 
  so they actually do n't know , in fact . 
  [ according to the website  ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/05/23/natos-image-improves-on-both-sides-of-atlantic/ ) republican voters : 65 % democratic voters : 63 % that 's despite the fact that republicans have a far more negative opinion of nato . 
   but there are no existential threats to the us now . 
  right , and why not ? 
  what 's changed since 1941 ? 
   try asking the people of those nations how things are going and if they 'd rather be in the united states ' position . 
  this is n't a poll . 
  in general , they 're not half as knowledgeable as they think they are . 
  neutrality worked out ok for switzerland , sweden and ireland because someone else was able to stop the nazis and soviets so they did n't have to . 
  otherwise , it would n't have worked out for them . 
  and unlike them , we do n't have anyone who can take care of such things for us . 
  and i 'm not sure it 's really working out , but that 's another discussion . 
  that does n't mean it works for us . 
  are you certain of that ? 
  unfortunately , neutrality does n't work in the modern world . 
  it took us two world wars to learn that . 
  hopefully we do n't have to learn it again . 
  i agree that `` hackers '' are a scapegoat , but that 's because the media has been ignoring the real issue , which is russia 's much larger program of information warfare against us . 
   even china is not at that level of influence , let alone russia . 
  you really underestimate russia . 
  the chinese are crude bullies ; russia has been the world champion of subversion since tsar nicholas 's time . 
  it 's the reason the chinese communist party exists . 
  only several million of them . 
  destabilizing libya was n't `` aligning with us . '', 
  that was us aligning ourselves with france . 
  and hollande pushed us to bomb syria too . 
  and when we invaded iraq , we were being shot at by mirages and super \u00c9tendards , not f-14s . 
  some nations just do n't have enough positive experiences with war . 
  i do n't think anyone really blames germans for being neutralist , although some can be self-righteous about it . 
  ironically , americans were more that before ww2 . 
  encouraging that ours is still that high after all the bullshit lately .
