  if you 're american , you should really brush up on your history . 
  today 's mass immigration to europe is nothing compared to what america has experienced for most of our history . 
  in the mid-1800s , 1/4 of americans were foreign-born . 
  half the union army was foreign-born ; some regiments spoke up to 14 languages . 
  in 1900 , there were more irish people in america than in ireland itself . 
  still today , more than half our population are first , second or third-generation immigrants . 
  but what do we learn from it ? 
  what i learn from it is that those who opposed irish and italian immigration on the grounds that such nations were `` criminally disposed '' were manifestly wrong : the benefits greatly outweighed the cost . 
  the same can be said about those who said chinese immigrants were too alien and would never assimilate . 
  today , chinese americans ( and muslim americans ) are among the most productive members of our society , and it was to our detriment that we excluded them to the extent that we did . 
  was the collateral damage less in previous centuries , when italian and irish immigrants made our cities into war zones between rival gangs ? 
  successful does n't mean moral . 
  i 'm talking about successful ideas in darwinian terms : memes that make a society more competitive . 
  well , the situation is somewhat different in america , where our national identity is actually based on immigration . 
  our population increased 300 % over the last century , mostly due to immigration . 
  we need a higher population to compete with nations like china , india and the eu in the future , and in order to maintain our national identity , the increase needs to come from immigration . 
  it 's deeper than that . 
  i 'm totally in favor of mass immigration , but there are many toxic trends in the left that need correcting . 
  broadly speaking , the left are those who oppose traditional thinking . 
  but ideas become traditional because they 're successful . 
  so the left becomes a two-edged sword , which serves and injures society at the same time . 
  the decline of center-left parties means the left becomes less introspective and less willing to consider traditional viewpoints , and ends up hurting society more than it helps . 
  edit : downvoting people because you disagree with them is an example of that exact trend . 
  have been for a while . 
  yes , but it will be a bittersweet victory when we finally get congressional representation and are forced to adopt non-sarcastic license plates like everyone else . 
  but in addition to the scottish parliament , constituencies in scotland also elect representatives to the house of commons in proportion to their population . 
  so how is may denying scotland 's right to representation ? 
  and i do n't think you answered the second question :  if you were may , would you include sturgeon in your loop ? 
  [ it 's on my license plates . 
  ] ( https://postimg.org/image/4rmcbw4at/ ) but i 'm afraid i do n't see the representational issue here . 
  scottish voters have representatives , but as i recall , the foreign policy of the united kingdom is set by its prime minister , who is theresa may , not nicola sturgeon . 
  can you answer the question ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but as the head of the snp , is n't sturgeon ideologically opposed to anything may might hope to accomplish ? 
  if you were may , would you include sturgeon in your loop ? 
   was n't the russian invasion of crimea a reaction to nato 's latest integration of eastern european nations to keep the strategic ` balance ' ? 
  that 's exactly the point . 
  russia tends to view other nations as strategic territory , to be invaded for its own purposes . 
  i actually teared up a little around 9:48 . 
  was n't expecting that . 
  i did n't say anything about `` bad guys . '', 
  why are people so inclined to interpret comments in ways they disagree with ? 
  she 's only been in office three months , and negotiations have n't even started yet . 
  edit : and i 'm pretty sure that 's not what the interviewer meant by `` negotiating position . '', 
  scottish nationalism obviously weakens the uk 's leverage at the negotiating table and gives the eu a stronger hand . 
  sturgeon seems to have dodged the question by redefining it , which suggests that may was probably wise to frustrate her by refusing to reveal any details of her plan . 
  so then , what would you actually accept as a credible and politically unbiased source ? 
  can you give an example ? 
  you know , we were also a doggedly neutral country for most of our history , the country of the [ neutrality acts . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neutrality_acts_of_1930s ) it was n't such a good idea . 
  but skins wear out so fast , and replacements can be so hard to find . 
  what is your definition of credible , politically-unbiased reporting ? 
  we still do n't know who manufactured the fake email , but only sputnik and donald trump , at the same time , were somehow in possession of it . 
  how could that have happened , unless their as-yet-unknown source was the same ? 
  anyway , beyond the use of your own reasoning ability ; and the evidence of other forms of information warfare such as troll farms ; trump 's mysterious ties to russian finance and yanukovych ; the fact that the director of national intelligence and the department of homeland security would n't be making formal accusations against the russian state if they did n't believe they had evidence ; and beyond everything else i could think of , who is a likelier suspect than putin ? 
  i just did that . 
  it 's a somewhat long article , so maybe you did n't read all of it , but here 's a basic summary of what happened : 1 . 
  sputnik ( russian state-owned news agency ) published a story in which it claimed to to expose something about clinton in her hacked emails obtained by wikileaks . 
  the story turned out to be false : the email they were quoting has now been revealed to be a fake . 
  we do n't know where it came from . 
  at the same time as it appeared on sputnik , donald trump gave a speech reading from the exact same fake email . 
  how did that happen ? 
  how was the republican nominee for president in possession of the same hoax email as sputnik , at the same time ? 
   please , show us . 
  [ do classified intelligence reports count as unbiased ? 
  ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-sidney-blumenthal-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-benghazi-sputnik-508635 )  how then can you say that he has major russian investors at all ? 
  because he said it himself before he was running for president . 
  [ so did his son . 
  ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-trumps-financial-ties-to-russia-and-his-unusual-flattery-of-vladimir-putin/2016/06/17/dbdcaac8-31a6-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html ) it 's not a secret ; we just do n't know the details . 
  he 's also claimed putin as a close personal friend until this year , when he suddenly ca n't remember ever having met him . 
   pr firm that worked for russian government until 2015 also worked for us government before . 
  does it mean that one of those governments is behind another ? 
  would it surprise you ? 
   putin has made it clear russua ca n't just blindly trust what either trump or clinton say . 
  but he 's also made it clear which of the two he prefers . 
  how can you doubt that ? 
  [ he loathes clinton . 
  ] ( http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/clinton-putin-226153 ), 
  i did n't say it was n't significant , but it 's still only 10 % . 
  yes . 
  and it 's not just about the leaks and hacks . 
  [ troll farms ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7 ) in russia have been flooding the american internet with pro-trump propaganda whereas they previously only flooded it with [ anti-american ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html ) propaganda . 
  trump himself has major russian investors ( we ca n't say who exactly , because he refuses to release his tax documents ) and his campaign manager was viktor yanukovych 's chief political advisor [ for seven years . 
  ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/paul_manafort_isn_t_a_gop_retread_he_s_made_a_career_of_reinventing_tyrants.html ) it goes on . 
  putin makes no secret of the fact that he really wants trump to be president , for obvious reasons . 
  it is if it does n't accomplish our objective , and it wo n't . 
  not that it actually means anything . 
  all that money does n't stop us from being thwarted in crimea and syria , or from almost ( and still possibly ) electing president trump because of russian information warfare . 
  https://twitter.com/russianembassy they 're usually pretty classy . 
  they have 10 % of the bundestag . 
  well , i 'm speculating , but i doubt we 'd want an intergovernmental system . 
  a federal union would be preferable . 
  and massachusetts would vote with east midlands more often than they would vote with texas anyway ; i 'd expect the fhs scheme to pass . 
  federal structures also grant states a lot of autonomy in creating their own systems of government . 
  also , there actually are signs that may and johnson are already thinking about this . 
  may name-dropped joseph chamberlain , the architect of the imperial federation idea , [ in her birmingham speech . 
  ] ( http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/the-man-theresa-may-wants-to-be/ ) boris johnson is also a longtime atlanticist . 
  sovereignty is n't handed to anyone . 
  it 's a federation . 
  the us and canada are federations already ; most of our laws are made by the member states , with power balanced between them and the federal government . 
  it 's a proven system .
