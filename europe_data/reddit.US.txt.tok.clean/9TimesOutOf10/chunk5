  it would n't be designed to prevent the overruling of individual member states . 
  the eu is designed that way , and it 's why the eu ca n't ratify a trade treaty . 
  in the anglosphere , we 're a lot more comfortable with the concept of majority rule . 
  the brexit camp long for neo-imperialist glory and a non-european future for britain , which is what this is . 
  prime minister theresa may only controls the world 's fifth or sixth largest economy ; president may would control its largest ever , as well as half the armed forces of the world . 
  i would expect the us to be a lot more agreeable to this than canada . 
  the us is a superpower and this makes us a greater superpower , and a rising power instead of a declining one . 
  the us and uk have both been global hegemons , and the prospect of economic and military supremacy appeals more to us than to canadians . 
  i mean an [ imperial federation .

  [ oceania , ` tis for thee .

  it 's the green party . 
  if it happened , there 's actually a very good chance that what remained of the uk would soon merge with us and canada , and instead of britain as a neighbor you would essentially have the british empire as a strong competitor to the eu . 
  finland is # 2 on the `` education '' list and norway is # 10 . 
  and we 're not on it , but in the us , at least , student debt is a [ fairly new thing ] ( http://a142.idata.over-blog.com/500x340/1/68/43/90/08-2010/06-2012/crazy-20student-20loans-202011-q2.png ) and [ usually is n't very much .

  [ all of these statistics are massively biased in favor of your country . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/58toxf/germany_is_the_best_country_in_the_world_to_be_a/d93r6ia/ ) despite that , yes , all new world countries , and australia and new zealand , have always been distinguished by [ social cohesion , ] ( http://www.bfna.org/media_advisory/u-s-social-cohesion-high-unaffected-by-immigration ) i.e. 
  `` the willingness of members of a society to cooperate with each other in order to survive and prosper . '', 
  it 's something all ex-settler colonies have in common . 
  edit : liberia is also a settler colony , as are most of the countries in the `` civic participation '' and `` political participation '' lists . 
  or british counties , or cities in some cases . 
  per capita statistics are inherently biased in favor of smaller populations . 
  it 's like how the bahamas won the most gold medals per capita at the olympics this year . 
  they won one medal . 
  but that 's enough to make them look like the most athletic people on the planet , with their population . 
  and it 's probably not coincidental that germany , japan and italy , the only large countries in the top 10 here , are all experiencing a declining population of young people .

  canada notice what almost all of these countries have in common : they all have populations between 100,000 and 10 million . 
  this is the same reason the nordic countries always appear near the top of every list : the analysis is lazy and tends to simply rank countries by population size , smallest to largest . 
  this kind of false information is probably great for nordic pride , but it 's poisonous to america , the third most populous country , where everyone who reads the washington post believes that we 're a third-world country in every statistic .

   obama in a skit even said he still does n't know why they gave it to him . 
  lol according to the [ official website , ] ( https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2009/obama-facts.html ) it was because `` he set in motion a plan for the withdrawal of u.s. occupying forces from iraq . '', 
   personally i do n't think the concept of `` european values '' makes much sense . 
  i think both the uk and the eu have western values and canada also has western values too . 
  on the opposite side , i actually think the phrase `` european values '' makes more sense than `` western values . '', 
   `` it seems obvious that the eu is now not capable of having an international agreement , even with a country that shares european values such as canada , * even with a country that is so kind and patient . '' * lol . 
  that 's just a very canadian outburst . 
  for the record , the fact that sweden sees itself as having a responsibility to mankind is something i think is basically a good thing , and healthy . 
  it 's not the first nation to have that kind of crusading mentality , and such an outlook can accomplish great things , but we all know that it can also get us into trouble . 
  competition * between * countries in other ways has ceased because of the end of colonialism ; the rise of the eu ; the fact that they are n't fighting wars against each other or trying to conquer the world anymore ; they they all have the same political ideology now , unlike in the past ...

  ] ( http://www.jstor.org/stable/40204222?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ), 
  i think it 's more about the definition of `` best . '', 
  europeans tend to judge countries on the basis of average living standards , and very little else . 
  but that 's a very new thing , only becoming predominant in the latter half of the 20th century , since other areas of competition between european countries has ceased . 
  i 've always thought the british were more romantic about ship names .

  it had to crash sometime . 
  trump is just the collapse of our [ sixth party system , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixth_party_system ) which took over from the [ fifth party system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifth_party_system ) and will soon give way to the seventh . 
  every few decades , changing conditions cause our political system to break down and a realignment occurs . 
  you 're referring to current politics : the parties have given up . 
  political culture is the set of attitudes , practices and ideas held by a people that give order to political discussions and shape political behavior . 
  the collectivist spirit that exists in russia has been developing since prehistoric times , due to climate and other factors . 
  in the [ mir ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/obshchina ) ( `` society '' ) , the goal was to find the collective will , after which all opposition ceased , as everyone was subordinate to the common will . 
  that system was only discontinued in the early 20th century . 
  in an arab culture , reactions to political crises tend to be very different , because it 's a different political culture . 
  what i said was about political culture . 
  i do n't have much of an opinion on current politics . 
  well , like i was saying , i actually see that as healthy . 
  think about how the british maintained their power and independence for so long : all parties were unequivocal in support of the navy and naval supremacy , and in their foreign policy toward europe . 
  because they all understood the national interest . 
  if american parties ever have radically different foreign policies , then i will really be worried . 
  yup . 
  considering that we 've had 400 years of constitutional democracy , and 240 under one government , that demise is likely to be some distance over the horizon . 
   they may have different ideas about the motherland , but ` patriotism ' is the glue that binds them all . 
  therefore , it is symbolic that when zyuganov , the leader of the communist party , asks the audience if they believe that the russian state should have a guiding ideology to bind its people , the overwhelming majority raises their hands notwithstanding their political affiliation . 
   [ . . ]  it quickly becomes apparent the parliamentary political parties have ` decided ' to act together . 
  i think that 's the mentality of most `` great powers , '' that unanimity of opinion - or that desire for unanimity . 
  in russia it 's a very old thing , deriving from the days of the obshchina , when the vast majority of russians worked land that was communally owned and decisions were made collectively by the heads of families , creating a culture with a strong desire for consensus . 
  americans have had a similar mentality since the mayflower compact . 
  i sometimes worry that we may be losing that . 
  well :  `` clandestine '' cyber operation designed to harass and `` embarrass '' the kremlin leadership . 
  and :  former intelligence officers told nbc news that the agency had gathered reams of documents that could expose unsavory tactics by russian president vladimir putin . 
  it sounds like they 're considering exposing some of putin 's personal activities .
