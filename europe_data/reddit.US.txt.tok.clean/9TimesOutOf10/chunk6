  i think it would be highly uncharacteristic of obama to authorize it , though . 
  he fears escalation , and he hates decisive action . 
  remember the name , because it 's probably going to be in the news in your lifetime ... edit : it really is . 
  a major eruption is expected in the next several decades . 
  and that 's [ scary .

  [ neo-ottomanists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neo-ottomanism ) like erdo\u011fan are just part of a global trend that includes putin in russia , xi jinping in china , shinzo abe in japan , tony blair in the uk and george bush in the us . 
  it 's interesting how closely the `` multipolar world '' we 're evolving into after the cold war resembles the world of 1900 in practice . 
  do you mean william the bastard ? 
   he already resigned . 
  but how does the fact , that he made business in ukraine and later with trump proof that he or trump is a russian puppet ? 
  there are no ties other than that , there are tons of ties other than that . 
  trump himself has russian investors and was bailed out by the russian oligarchy years ago . 
   if i remember correctly , he said that nato members have to pay their fair share , if they want the us to help them in such a case translated into english , what that actually means is that if russia attacks latvia ( which does n't spend 2 % yet ) , according to trump , the united states will dishonor its alliance . 
   yeah , it would be better if they 'd wait for the re-elections , both sides agreed upon . 
  yes , but it would n't have made any difference . 
  i did n't say that . 
  but at least the coalition * tried * to help establish democracy and stability in iraq , which is better than doing nothing . 
  and :   germany supplied most of his chemical weapons . 
   that was a major fuckup on our part . 
  but at least some persons responsible were held accountable ( 17 years for helping to commit war crimes for the main supplier of the chemicals , the iraqi culprits were hanged ) and rules put in place to prevent such things from happening again . 
  you 're referring to [ frans van anraat , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frans_van_anraat ) who was still living in iraq until the regime fell . 
  he was only brought to justice because of the invasion . 
   that 's a curious line of reasoning . 
  sort of like getting into a fight where the other person later dies of his injuries only if you think that everything that 's happened in the last 13 years was an inevitable consequence of the liberation of iraq , and that 's obviously not the case . 
  besides , we 're talking about two different things . 
  one was the un-mandated liberation and rebuilding of iraq that bush wanted , and the other was what actually happened . 
  [ does this look like an american plane ? 
  ] ( http://forum.keypublishing.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=139180&amp;d=1156178032 ) virtually everything the iraqi army and air force used was bought from either france or russia . 
  ironically , the iranians were using american f-14s from before the islamic revolution . 
   you can try to twist things around as much as you like , it does n't change the fact that you ( or your country ) screwed up majorly in 2003 and that the whole region has to suffer to this date because of your actions . 
  you can either accept that and try to learn from your mistakes or ignore it and most likely end up supporting similar disastrous `` military adventures '' . 
  before 2003 , the un spent 10 years destabilizing iraq with sanctions , killing its people and ruining its economy . 
  since then , iran and syria have been destabilizing iraq , syria has had a civil war , iraqis have fought each other and lots of other shit has happened . 
  if you 're going to say that everything since 2003 has been because of american and british aggression , you 're just not being honest about it . 
  and putin did n't threaten to veto un authorization in 2003 because he 's opposed to acts of aggression . 
  it was geopolitical , and schr\u00f6der and chirac supported him . 
  they 're the only ones that occurred during the actual invasion , so in that sense , yes . 
  and the effect of the previous sanctions in reducing iraq to ruins ca n't be dismissed either . 
   hitler did n't have us support when invading his neighbours ? 
  really ? 
  his entire military was russian and french . 
  [ and germany provided most of his chemical weapons . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_chemical_weapons_program#the_1980s_program )  caused ~ 250.000 deaths ( ~ 180.000 civilians ) the war lasted six weeks and cost [ 7300 civilian deaths . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_iraq ) the previous 10 years of un sanctions , backed by france and germany , are thought to have killed at least a million , most of them children . 
  and they did n't remove saddam from power . 
   was an illegal war of aggression it was `` illegal '' because putin vetoed its authorization at the un , with chirac and schr\u00f6der siding with him . 
  and the nature of the trade as free trade , and the cross-border investment . 
  the us buys 75 % of canadian exports . 
   you botched the whole thing and who helped putin sabotage it ? 
  yes , actually , other nations including the us did `` liberate '' iraq , and [ have acted altruistically ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_provide_comfort ) in iraq [ more than once . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_northern_watch ) and if there 's one nation in europe who should have known that 's what they would do , and that it was n't some imperialist plot , it should have been germany . 
  how was saddam different from hitler ? 
  he usurped democracy , committed large-scale genocide and attacked his neighbors . 
  and he was n't going to live forever . 
  if the coalition had n't invaded , we just would have been pulled into another war at another time . 
  if we had kept faith with each other , everything that 's happening now might have been averted . 
  does n't korea have the world 's highest iq ? 
   activists fear that the deals could water down european standards in the key areas of workers ' rights , public health and the environment . 
  they say it will open up new areas for privatisation and give corporations new powers to make profits . 
  is it wrong that i actually kind of want ceta to fail if ttip is going to ? 
  i mean , the us and canada are basically a single economy , so what 's the point of subjecting only one of them to this bullshit ? 
  not to mention the fact that the eu already has free trade with some of the poorest and most exploitative countries on earth , so what exactly are these standards ? 
  it was never voted on , because russia and france announced that they would veto it . 
  considering that 40 nations participated in the coalition itself , including middle eastern nations , i think it had a fair amount of support . 
  as for why russia and france threatened to veto it , and why germany sided with them , i do n't know . 
  it might have had something to do with politics . 
  saddam 's army was soviet-trained and soviet-equipped , and its air force used french mirages and super \u00c9tendards . 
  and schr\u00f6der and chirac were both , at the time , trying to get closer to putin . 
   germany and france veto 'd the application out of respect of russian concerns . 
  do n't forget the very sensible russo-franco-german alliance that blocked un authorization for the liberation of iraq . 
  i mean , un-backed democracy in iraq . 
  who needs it ? 
  yes , and ? 
  what i said is the official [ explanation . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_seal_of_the_united_states#symbolism ), 
   and trump is an agent because he wants peacefull relations with russia ? 
  he 's actually promised to not help nato allies if they 're invaded by russia . 
  and his campaign manager was yanukovych 's chief political advisor for seven years , for fuck 's sake . 
  and about yanukovych , are you aware that the ukrainian government has more than one branch ? 
  he was removed from office by the parliament , which is also elected , and new elections were held a month later . 
  but even if that had n't happened , he would n't have been re-elected . 
   a bunch of alligations with zero proof behind them , there 's actually a ton of proof , besides the fact that it 's vladimir putin , ex-kgb , and of course he 's doing this . 
   is snowden also a russian agent ? 
  in the sense that he 's being used by putin , the same as trump , yes . 
  and yes , if mexicans voted for a pro-russian president , that would be fine . 
  mexico is a sovereign nation , as is ukraine . 
  it would be their right . 
  to summarize the article i linked to , the us involvement was through organizations like the national endowment for democracy and usaid - public advocacy groups that promote the cause of democracy in other countries . 
  they did things like funding an anti-corruption campaign , which was naturally an anti-yanukovych campaign since yanukovych was a corrupt gangster . 
  other countries including china and israel spend tons of money lobbying our government and media , and meddling in our politics , the same way . 
  russia even goes further , using public propaganda ( rt ) , [ covert disinformation campaigns ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7 ) and illegal actions like hacking our political candidates to influence our elections . 
  and they do the same things in ukraine and other countries . 
  i mean , why did yanukovych flee to russia ? 
  because he was basically a russian agent , just like trump will be if he 's elected . 
  not * only * on facebook . 
  but still in ways that did n't involve tanks and soldiers . 
  [ this article ] ( http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/22758-meet-the-americans-who-put-together-the-coup-in-kiev ) is written from an anti-western perspective , but even it gives a better idea of how that money was spent . 
  i wish they could stop saying `` united states of europe . '', 
  as if there are n't actual examples in the world of nations created by a merging of other nations .
