  we do n't have much in the way of separate cultures , and we 're not supposed to . 
  the point of the united states is that it 's supposed to be one culture : [ * `` one from many . 
  '' * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e_pluribus_unum ) but he 's wrong - europe could have that . 
  it 's not actually that different from when new sweden and new netherlands merged with new england . 
  [ emperor 's finest . 
  ] ( http://chrisniedenthal.com/en/works/medalista-1989 ), 
   a spokesman for labour leader jeremy corbyn said russia was not the only foreign power involved in the syrian conflict corbyn shows his colors also . 
  remember when boris was expected to be bad at this job ? 
  he seems nice . 
   our american partners do n't hide the fact that they supported it to a great degree , on facebook . 
  not with tanks . 
  the sad irony here is that [ obama continues to refuse to provide arms to ukraine ] ( http://freebeacon.com/national-security/obama-wont-arm-ukrainian-military-as-putin-seizes-ground/ ) while putin says this . 
  that 's probably what the spanish said . 
  you can see them in the image , the bone shapes in the bread . 
  not real bones - just bread bones . 
  but yeah , the bread represents your deceased loved ones and is quite tasty . 
   bread for dead/death ... sound romanian as f. . . !, 
  it 's actually bread * of * dead . 
  it has bones . 
  could you speculate on why is this article is downvoted ? 
  it 's a yacht . 
  i ask because i post here from time to time , and it seems like a lot of articles never get above 0 despite being perfectly appropriate content . 
  ok . [ china exports $ 1.8 million usd of pig iron per year , ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/china/exports-of-pig-iron-spiegeleisen ) which is virtually none , but not quite none . 
  [ china does n't export any kind of iron . 
  ] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/428770/china-imports-of-pig-iron/ ), 
  [ china imports iron , does n't export it . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-trade-ironore-idusl4n1am0qb ), 
  i endorse mr. berry 's proposal , except that the new vessel should be a sidewheeler christened * victoria and albert * and should look like [ this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hmy_victoria_and_albert_ii ) edit : and the brasswork had better shine like the sun . 
  if my retinas are n't burning , floggings for everyone . 
  i gave it 50/50 . 
  are n't you late for a book burning ? 
  * sigh * we have had 400 years of constitutional democracy . 
  it would be nice if the lyrics had anything to say about what those colors mean . 
  for the record , the red signifies valor , and the white signifies innocence . 
  and blue is vigilance , because only through vigilance can a nation combine valor and innocence at the same time . 
  i honestly do n't understand why people watch these debates . 
  these candidates have been talking constantly for over a year . 
  anyone who intends to vote should have made up their minds a long time ago . 
  dark , cold and free of insects is certainly not depressing to me either . 
  as i said , * whatever the reason , * that is what we 're doing . 
  what 's so great about cultural differences in the first place , that requires them to be preserved ? 
  culture is just the result of people interacting with each other and it changes all the time . 
  trying to freeze it in stasis seems unnatural and unfeasible . 
  the eu already has a larger combined gdp than the us , and a larger population , and the us has been a strong supporter of its expansion . 
  russia would only be another 150 million people . 
  excuse me ? 
  being honest with ourselves , whatever the reason , we are currently trying to ruin putin and russia with sanctions , so we can hardly complain at being struck back . 
  and it is intelligent of them to strike this way , taking advantage of the collapse of our [ sixth party system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixth_party_system ) to get a lunatic like trump elected president . 
  not only has he promised to lift the sanctions and work for a russia/us alliance , he 's also an imbecile who would bring america to ruin if he got the chance . 
  it was n't originally a world forum . 
  it was an alliance of nations `` convinced that complete victory over their enemies is essential to defend life , liberty , independence and religious freedom , and to preserve human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands , and that they are now engaged in a common struggle against savage and brutal forces seeking to subjugate the world . '', 
   after all the shit the idiot has came out with i ca n't believe it 's a few pussy comments that 's pushed him over the edge . 
  because this is what the media spends time talking about , not the fact that he promises to dishonor our treaties and betray our allies . 
  but my point is that this is normal and expected whenever a popular sovereignty movement wins . 
  irish history bears that out , and so does american history . 
  it is n't anything special about brexit . 
  it became a burden on humanity when the first non-democratic nation was added . 
  it makes no sense to let dictators vote on matters pertaining to civilization . 
  any independence movement will result in some of that . 
  these articles are just written to exploit the situation for political purposes . 
  in this article , an activist group is arguing for harsher sentences for certain crimes . 
  i do n't know what it is about us . 
  the american left elected obama in 2008 because he promised to `` get us out '' of iraq . 
  and he did , and iraq went up in flames and was overrun by terrorists exactly as clinton and other `` warmongers '' predicted . 
  and those same leftists are still calling clinton a warmonger and refusing to vote for her . 
  i see the same patterns in the european left . 
  why do n't we learn ? 
  i 'm sure we would all rather have germans than ... ( shudder ) ... * canadians ... *, 
  as a leftist , this is indeed what i hate most about the left . 
  we never take responsibility and we never learn . 
  every time we turn out to be wrong , we just decide to be even wronger in the future . 
   what 's the difference between not doing anything and imposing sanctions ? 
  the sanctions are thought to have killed at least a million people , most of them children . 
   not really , the chinese are not eager to copy u.s dysfunctionnal political system and europe stagnating and populist magnets politics . 
  really ? 
  the most successful political system in history is dysfunctional compared to china ? 
  i think you should take a closer look at the situation . 
  despite all our problems you read about , there 's no state in america where an active separatist movement even exists . 
  we have managed to combine total freedom of speech with total loyalty . 
  china ca n't even let its people vote , or it would disintegrate within a year . 
   the only thing that can stop them is war or a global economic crisis on the scale of 1929 . 
  yeah , they arguably have that already and if they do n't , they 're going to . 
  china 's unemployment statistics are a lie . 
  500 million chinese live on less than $ 2/day and the government has built hundreds of cities that are still completely empty . 
  they 're empty because there are no jobs and no one can afford to live in them , but they ca n't stop building them because when they do , they 'll crash . 
  their economy is built on producing things for which there 's no demand . 
  the prc is a textbook example of how authoritarian economics result in misallocation of resources . 
  the war lasted six weeks and cost 7300 civilian lives . 
  the previous sanctions are thought to have killed at least a million , most of them children , without removing saddam hussein from power . 
  this is probably not the best place to rehash this , though . 
   you are so wrong !, 
  the truth is that the chinese are influencing hollywood now not the other way around the influence is going both ways . 
  and the communist party 's indirect censorship of hollywood is an issue that demands attention . 
  but we 're exporting our lifestyle , if not our politics , as insidiously as ever . 
  and the fact that they have to resort to censorship tells you who will win in the end .
