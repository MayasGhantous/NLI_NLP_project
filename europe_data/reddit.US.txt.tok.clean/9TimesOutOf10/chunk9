  and to be honest , a lot of it is because of the influence of european soft power on our politics . 
  how can he lecture europeans on the importance of `` remembering who we are '' when , this year , [ americans ' own pride and patriotism is at an all-time low ? 
  ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/193379/new-low-extremely-proud-americans.aspx ) the obama administration has taught a generation of americans to reject `` who we are . '', 
  we are [ neo-imperialists . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/national_seal.jpg ) remembering who we are would be embracing something to which they 're ideologically opposed . 
  kerry 's always believed in the european project , and i guess it 's his job to speak , but i 'm so tired of the obama administration 's feckless and tone-deaf diplomacy , which is basically ( 1 ) take no action and ( 2 ) tell everyone what to do . 
  edit : typo, 
   america is going through what we went through in the 50s . 
  we 've lost india ? 
    `` only a national comrade ( `` volksgenosse '' ) can be a citizen . 
  to be a national comrade one must have german blood . 
  no jew can therefore be a national comrade . '', 
   that obviously was n't part of the constitution . 
  no , but the constitution still identifies the brd as the state of the deutsche volk , so the question is : who are the deutsche volk ? 
  as i was saying , this is the main difference between nationalists : defining the nation . 
  american nationalism asserts that americans are `` one nation '' ( it 's in the [ pledge of allegiance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pledge_of_allegiance ) so it must be true ) , thereby rejecting ethnic origin as a requirement of membership in the nation . 
  legally , as far as i know , so does germany . 
  although both countries at different times have had [ less inclusive ideas . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/master_race#.27master_race.27_in_the_united_states ) and for less ideologically prone countries there 's the canada/uk method , where `` nation '' is defined as the inherited realms of queen elizabeth ii and her heirs and successors . 
  i considered putting it more diplomatically , but it would have been a massive karma hit either way . 
  and they 've been thinking that [ for 240 years ] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=mtljdaaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa29&amp;dq=%22flaming+theories+of+democracy%22+%22imagining+america+in+late%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjk5ps6imhpahwm6imkhtfgadcq6aeihjaa#v=onepage&amp;q=%22flaming%20theories%20of%20democracy%22%20%22imagining%20america%20in%20late%22&amp;f=false ) and that 's unlikely to change in our lifetimes . 
  it 's not similar . 
  actually , jefferson and washington both said that native americans were the intellectual equals of whites and deserved the same rights . 
  after all , all men are created equal . 
  what happened in the 19th century was n't hypernationalism ; it was the gradual extinction of that nationalism due to the pressure of immigration and other factors , including the continuation of racial slavery in the south . 
  and it was the victory of american nationalism in the civil war that reversed that trend . 
  without nationalism , the united states would n't exist , and whatever existed in its place would probably be worse in many ways . 
  / u/gypsiehunter also ,  your wikipedia link on nation states :   a nation state is a type of state that conjoins the political entity of a state to the cultural entity of a nation , from which it aims to derive its political legitimacy to rule and potentially its status as a sovereign state  that 's not how or why the brd was founded . 
  nowhere is something like that written in our constitution . 
  it is . 
  it conjoins the political entity of germany ( brd ) to the cultural entity of the deutsche volk , from which it derives its legitimacy , just like all previous expressions of german nationalism . 
   i do n't think germany is a nation state ( anymore ) . 
  one quarter of our population is n't originally from germany . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multinational_state that link also says the same thing about the united states , but that 's a little ridiculous . 
  americans are a multi-ethnic nation . 
  it seems to be saying that more than one ethnicity ca n't be included in the same nation , which seems rather close to racism . 
   do you know what nationalist ideas are ? 
   this is how we europeans interpret the term nationalism . 
  that 's called [ ethnic nationalism . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_nationalism ) there are [ other kinds of nationalism . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) i 'm fully aware of that europeans ( especially germans ) interpret the word nationalism to mean ethnic nationalism , but that 's not what it actually means . 
  americans have always been highly nationalist , and [ our form of nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american%27s_creed ) is one in which * anyone * can be a citizen and that everyone is equal . 
  and [ everyone else ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canadian_nationalism ) in the new world has the same kind of nationalism . 
  nationalism has been a unifying and constructive force in our history , as it has usually been in german history - germany would n't even exist without nationalism , and neither would the united states , canada or mexico . 
  what europeans say about nationalism is as uninformed as what ignorant americans say about socialism on / r/shitamericanssay . 
  nationalism does n't mean national socialism . 
  in fact , most europeans are nationalists without being conscious of their nationalism . 
   if there is n't a clear definition , then why do you think you can determine whether we are nationalist or not ? 
  because you define the political state of germany as representing the german nation , and you identify with that nation , and you support ( as in the op ) the unity , well-being and self-determination of of the german nation . 
  that 's nationalism . 
  there are different forms of nationalism , but they all have some things in common . 
  the point where forms of nationalism differ is in how they define the nation . 
  ethnic nationalists define it by blood : germans are those with german blood . 
  cultural nationalists define it by shared culture : germans are those who act german or have german beliefs . 
  civic nationalists define the nation by consent : germans are those who choose to live in germany . 
  the last two are the predominant kinds of nationalism in germany today . 
   you just do n't want to accept that people do n't need nationalism . 
  nationalism is a thing of the past . 
  nationalism is the last thing that will make your country `` great again '' . 
  i 'm not a trump voter . 
  and clinton is more of a nationalist than trump is . 
  unlike trump , she actually believes america * is * a great nation and endorses traditional tenets of [ american nationalism . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_nationalism )  the brd never formally acknowledged the souvereignity of the ddr . 
  there was only one legitimate germany . 
  barsoap already emphazised that . 
  i actually am aware of that . 
  the expression `` two states in one nation '' was often used . 
  notice the word * nation . 
  * that 's because germany is a [ * nation state * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation_state ) and the brd never recognized the ddr 's sovereignty because of the principle of * national sovereignty . 
  * nowadays we might be so accustomed to these ideas that we forget they 're nationalist ideas . 
   no form of nationalism `` exists '' . 
  i 'm done here . 
  this is just so bizarre . 
  the meaning of political theories is n't determined by what the `` man on the street '' says they mean . 
  civic nationalism is a political theory , a form of nationalism that asserts that democratic polities need a national identity in order to function . 
  that 's what it is . 
  it exists . 
  if germans believe that it does n't exist or that it means what that link says , they 're objectively wrong . 
   within an academic context people can discuss concepts in more precise ways using stipulated definitions ... that context does not exist in a reddit thread , nor did you make any explicit indications that you were engaging in that kind of discussion . 
  really ? 
  what was the point of my original comment , if i was n't indicating that ? 
   people can not be misinformed as to the meaning of `` nationalism '' if they are using it in the way that is accepted in normal conversation . 
  ugh . . yes , yes they can be . 
  you 're basically saying that if enough people are misinformed , it 's not misinformation anymore . 
  it does n't work that way . 
  germans actually are misinformed about nationalism , as you can prove to yourself just by asking any number of germans about it , or by reading the comments in this thread . 
  most are unaware that any such thing as civic nationalism exists . 
  they think nationalism means ethnic nationalism , basically nazis . 
   the point is that , as you well know , the definition of `` nationalist '' that you are using is completely divorced from the common use of the term . 
  the other point , as i said in my first comment , is that the common use of the term is misinformed . 
  the way europeans use the word * nationalism * is no different from the way americans have traditionally used the word * socialism . 
  * you would n't say that socialism legitimately means something different just because americans think it does . 
  europeans , especially germans , are misinformed about nationalism and patriotism . 
  and the fact that the top-voted reply is about americans being stupid should tell you the real reason for much of the hostility . 
  then you obviously have n't read the arguments below , which prove that people obviously do n't know what it is . 
  and the fact that the top-voted reply is about americans being dumb should give you a hint as to the real reason for the hostility . 
  the fact that there are different types of nationalism was my point - that 's why i linked to the wiki page for `` types of nationalism '' in my * first comment . 
  * the fact that there are * different * types of nationalism means that people who endorse any * one * type are nationalists to the same extent as people who endorse any * other * type . 
  the fact that you 're calling this a fallacy of equivocation just proves the original point i was making . 
  i obviously understand that nationalism has a negative connotation in germany ; the point of the comment was that connotation and definition are n't the same .
