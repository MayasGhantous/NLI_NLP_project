  books are great , you can get published even if you believe that space aliens can cure all diseases and you get money . 
  great for you that is . 
  i do n't see how a common feminism banner would help in their sales . 
  a transfeminist is unlikely to buy janice raymond 's books . 
  even if there was n't a common feminism banner those people would still buy their books . 
   i do n't recall if it was relationships or askwomen but a guy posted about a girl that cheated on him twice with 2 different people and she argued she felt bad saying no , and to my utter disbelief the comments supported her and cried rape . 
  and i found it horrible that the simple notion that she has issues in setting boundaries got me labeled as a rape apologist , cause that 's what happens when you do n't jump on the r word bandwagon . 
  / r/askwomen is n't all of feminism at all . 
   no , the message is fat is sexy , jenifer lawerence is fat , marlyn monroe was fat and so on , it is delusional and only creates disappointment and self esteem issues when the girls find out that in the real world fat is n't sexy for the majority of men . 
  because ** society ** tells that fat is ugly . 
  ** society ** tells people that fat people are bad people that should be rejected . 
   exactly , banding up under the umbrella term of feminism is counterproductive alienating and is only useful to increase book revenues for specialty authors . 
  how does feminism = book revenues ? 
  i do n't get that connection at all . 
   not negesaraly , i heard variables like if the woman was emotionally vulnerable or the woman could not properly turn down the man because she felt bad rejecting him i 've never heard anyone call that rape . 
   no , they intent to attack superficial standards that are n't voluntary , and do n't give a fuck about how it perpetuates the body image issue among young feminist bystandards the message i hear is that be who you are . 
  that 's the message support . 
  as for the keeping it a women 's issue , that 's what the third-wave is trying to combat . 
  women 's issues intersect with many other issues and you ca n't make it just a women 's issue . 
  race-related , lgbt + , secular , men 's , etc. 
  issues must be addressed as well . 
   redefining rape to a ever increasing vague term , diminishing the role of female responsibility and agency when it comes to sex if they say yes and of an age to consent , it 's consential . 
   artificially generating new standards of beauty and perpetuating a women 's value in terms of sexual attractiveness they intend for the opposite but it backfires . 
  you are beautiful messages define beauty as worth . 
  this is a legitimate concern people have made . 
   60 % of college graduates are women and a lot of jobs are dominated by men  abortion bans are generally accepted as primitive in the us this is n't so . 
  the second largest party in the us is anti-abortion and the `` pro-life '' movement is a major movement . 
  sigh . 
  what do you see as faux battles and what do you see as actual progress ? 
  yep , it will be done anyways and there is no reason to ban it . 
  it will be safer if legal . 
  a person can do whatever they want with their body as long as it does n't restrict another person 's freedom . 
  she is n't all second wavers but she is most certainly the people the third wave grew in opposition to . 
  feminism is n't just fighting for fighting 's sake . 
  do you think all rights for women can be achieved just like that ? 
  that there 's no left over inequalities ? 
  i do n't believe that but we 're getting better . 
   wow , can you tell me the author that said that ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janice_raymond  i disagree , they should limit themself to common sense gender inequality . 
  and hop on the humanism train for non gender issues . 
  there is only so much you can do with a name until you dilute all of its core values and render it pointless . 
  the equalism movement is a new one . 
  i do n't call myself an equalist or a gender humanist or what have you because i do n't much about it . 
  third-wave feminism is a movement i can study and i agree with its message of rejecting gender roles , supporting body autonomy , caring about lower class people and the like . 
  what do equalists view as gender equality ? 
   completely false , ask 1000 people and most will give it a semantic value feminism needs to rebrand itself . 
  we 're not all second-waves !, 
   attacked or not promoted it because they knew the issue would spark conservative flames ? 
  you can blame them for not protesting with their breast out but they had clear political common sense objectives and that is what made them successful . 
  arguing for something is always easier than arguing against , and if you look trough the responses of those 1000 people , a lot of them will use `` against '' when describing third wave . 
  nope . 
  many attacked it . 
  many believed that prostitution was an invention of the patriarchy . 
  they also attacked gay men and trans people as agents of the patriarchy . 
  third-wave feminism grew in opposition to those people . 
  for one , feminist as a term means nothing . 
  the word came from an area where women had less rights than they do now and nobody bothered to change the name . 
  historical continuity i guess . 
  second the reason third wave feminists greatly support body autonomy is because second wave feminism attacked it . 
  a lot of third wave feminism grew in reaction to second wave feminism . 
  it is n't a gender issue but third-wave feminists support body autonomy for all genders . 
  as long as it does n't harm others . 
   feminist aspects third-wave feminism supports sex work rights including prostitution . 
  a sex worker can do whatever they want with their bodies . 
  why is this work of art getting downvoted ? 
  this video makes me sad i ca n't afford to visit other countries . 
  to play devil 's advocate : there was a lot of pro-russian sentiment before the troops were there . 
  i was talking about this and we came up with the conclusion that if they 're going to lose anyways why give it legitimacy ? 
  of course the question is would they lose if they voted ? 
  i would argue that / r/oney is pretty good , not perfect though but nothing is . 
  still the red pill was never good and pretty much is the definition of misogyny . 
  the red pill ideology would harm men if got into power too as / u/maxet 's comments about rape show . 
  just do n't read it . 
  tl ; dr : if you want to make your life miserable by only focusing on sex and outdated gender roles , shallow the red pill . 
  if you do n't want that , just say no . 
  of course if those regions were n't pro-russia to begin with they could n't do this . 
  still amazingly sad . 
  it is hard to say what russia wants . 
  we know that they want ukraine to be close to russia but how close , that 's debatable . 
  they wo n't , when they say that separatist movements are russian imperialism i think that they honestly believe that . 
  even if they do n't it shows they oppose separatism . 
  my bet is the referendum results are going to either be union with russia or independence . 
  if that comes to pass then shit is going to get even worse . 
  i thought ukraine was n't going to recognize referendums in the east . 
  then again that has n't stopped people in the past . 
   demanded that the regional council call a referendum on the future of donbass { the donets basin } does that mean that donbass could join russia like crimea might ? 
  does n't this basically mean donetsk is declaring independence , at least temporarily ? 
  really the only thing that united the revolutionaries and their supporters is that they do n't like yanukovych . 
  the euromaidan stopped being about just the eu as soon as the government repressed the protests . 
  some of the protestors were fascists , rioters and fascist rioters but most were just peaceful people who wanted democracy . 
  that 's a very bad photoshop . 
  true, 
  more like the russian empire , putin is n't anywhere close to being a communist , socialist or even a social democrat . 
  i guess you 're right , to russia this is justified and is worth international condemnation . 
  russia refuses to recognize the new government and now it is invading crimea . 
  great way to show that you can be trusted internationally russia -_-, 
  i never said they should join russia , i was only saying that it would n't set a precedence for other irrendentist movements . 
  well seeing the only political party in south tyrol who wants to join austria is s\u00fcd-tiroler freiheit and it only has 3 out of 35 seats in the provincial council i assume they do n't want to join austria . 
  the difference is that the hungarian slovaks do n't want to join hungary and south tyrol mostly does n't want to join austria . 
  crimea has a good amount of citizens who want to join russia .
