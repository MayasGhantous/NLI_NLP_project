hmmm ... 
  i believe most states in the us have restriction codes for automatic transmission only . 
  i have no idea what would trigger them aside from an amputation . 
  well ... it 's annoying to do the mental math - we tend to think of temps in terms of `` 50 's , '' `` 60 's '' `` 70 's , '' etc. 
  i had to find a way to mentally frame centigrade !, 
  why would they pay sales tax for raw materials ? 
  [ from the u.s. small business administration ( sba.gov ) ] ( https://www.sba.gov/blogs/sales-tax-101-small-business-owners-and-online-retailers )  what types of transactions are exempt from sales tax ? 
   while you should check with your individual state government as to which goods and services sold in your state are subject to sales tax ( unfortunately , it varies a lot ) , generally you are not required to collect sales tax for the following transactions :  resold items -- retailers and resellers do n't typically have to pay sales tax on wholesale purchases since it 's assumed that the end consumer will pay sales tax on these items at the point of purchase . 
   raw materials -- if you produce and sell goods that will be the raw material for other goods , these items are typically considered sales tax exempt . 
   non-profits -- sales made to non-profits are exempt from sales tax . 
  if you are involved in these types of transactions , you 'll need to get a copy of the buyer 's tax-exempt certificate or number ( issued by the state ) . 
  $ 50,000 / year is gross . 
  figure ( generously ) 40,000 / year after taxes . 
  divide it by 12 months , and you have $ 3333 now , figure $ 900 for a nice apartment ; if you 're stuck sharing walls with your neighbors , you do n't want to live in a dump . 
  $ 1500 if you rent a house . 
  let 's just say $ 1200 so , $ 2100 left . 
  now , figure $ 100/month for your phone . 
  maybe more , maybe less , and there are a ton of variables . 
  now groceries ... 
  living alone , you should be able to get by on $ 200/month . 
  you still have no way to get around . 
  lets add in a $ 300/month car payment for a modest car , and another $ 100 for insurance . 
  now , $ 100 for fuel . 
  you 're at $ 1200/month remaining . 
  $ 300/week . 
  you want to go out once or twice during that week , so put aside $ 100 for that . 
  down to $ 800 for the month . 
  let 's be responsible and put $ 500 into savings and investments . 
  you still have n't bought things like clothes , furniture , entertainment , vacations , tires/maintenance on the car , christmas gifts , and so on . 
  we still have n't even addressed healthcare ( ideally you have a good plan through work , pay a small premium , and do n't have many issues - most people really do n't have the health insurance problems that reddit implies ) . 
  the money disappears quickly . 
  you can shave off a number of areas there - get a flip-phone and a cheap plan with no data . 
  split the rent with roommates , if you do n't mind living with others . 
  buy a beater car and keep minimal insurance on it . 
  but $ 50,000 / year is n't that much . 
  i think the average displacement is 3.2 l , or at least it was a few years back . 
  my car has a 2.5 l , and my wife 's has a 1.8 l. . . funny enough , i think this is the largest engine i 've ever owned . 
  my grandfather had a pickup with a 6.4 l v8 . 
  i asked what the mileage was like , and he said it got about 8 miles to the gallon but could hit 11 on the highway . 
  he left it to me when he passed away , but i did n't want to pay to feed it . 
  ahem ... that 's 54 cents per liter , thank you very much . 
  but i started driving in the 90 's , and usually filled up for 25 cents / liter . 
  as a 16 year old , i budgeted $ 11/week for 12 gallons of gas , and that would take me my usual 350 miles or so of driving to school , visiting friends , going to the movies , driving around aimlessly , etc. 
  not counting school-busses ( which are n't quite public transportation ) , the first time i rode public transportation , i was 25 - the london tube . 
  its not a thing most people do in the u.s. ( outside of a few metro areas ) . 
   farenheit temperatures . 
  here water freezes at precisely 0c and boils at 100c . 
  -10 c means you 're in moscow , 10c is fresh weather , 20c is easygoing , 30c is too hot to go outside and 40c you 're ill . noone has to know any other value . 
  i 've traveled enough to have a good mental value for centigrade , and it 's a bit off from yours !, 
  - 0 ( 32\u00baf ) = coat and avoid the outdoors - it 's cold enough that water is turning to ice outside - 10 ( 50\u00baf ) = still need jacket , and not going to spend much time outside . 
  - 20 ( 68\u00baf ) = the low end of acceptable - a bit below normal indoor temperature ( 23/73 ) . 
  sweatshirt - 30 ( 86\u00baf ) is a perfect outdoor weather . 
  warm , but not hot . 
  - 40 ( 104\u00baf ) s a hot summer day . 
  stay inside until it cools in the evening . 
  i enjoy coming here , as the answers are informative , and people are generally not dismissive or quick to leap to judgement . 
  cross-cultural dialog is what brought me to reddit in the first place , but many of the larger subreddits are filled with vitriolic attacks on strawmen ; it 's fatiguing after some time . 
  i always try to offer the same courtesy , enthusiasm , and to the greatest extent possible the benefit of the doubt that a question is not an excuse to troll on / r/askanamerican . 
  the statues in front of buckingham palace looked older than that , but it could just be confirmation bias , as i expect everything i see in europe to be incredibly old !, 
  the wikipedia article on the sickle and hammer does n't have much to say on the historical use of the emblems . 
  it does mention that [ latvia ] ( https://sputniknews.com/russia/20130621181788657-latvia-bans-soviet-nazi-symbols/ ) , [ lithuania ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7459976.stm ) , and [ ukraine ] ( https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-bans-soviet-era-symbols-1428606171 ) have banned both nazi and soviet symbology . 
  for example , hungary 's law on `` use of symbols of totalitarianism '' prohibits the sickle and hammer in the same sentence as the swastika , the insignia of the ss and `` arrow cross '' ( i 'm not sure what that is )  section 335 any person who : a ) distributes , b ) uses before the public at large , or c ) publicly exhibits , the swastika , the insignia of the ss , the arrow cross , the sickle and hammer , the five-pointed red star or any symbol depicting the above so as to breach public peace - specifically in a way to offend the dignity of victims of totalitarian regimes and their right to sanctity - is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by custodial arrest , insofar as the did not result in a more serious criminal offense . 
  i 'll add - i 'm surprised at the negative response to my question : i did n't insult anyone , nor imply that any nation is inferior or evil in any way - just my puzzlement that fasces did n't pick up the same connotations as the bolshevik symbols . 
  the eagle emblem reminds me of the byzantine/russian double-headed eagle - do they have a common source , or is it just a coincidence ? 
  thank you for your response - the history of symbols and how they are adapted and appropriated through history is fascinating . 
  also , regarding the fasces : they used to be on the u.s. dime , [ but were removed in 1946 , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dime_ ( united_states_coin ) # / media/file : mercury_dime . jpg ) and replaced with [ a torch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dime_ ( united_states_coin ) # / media/file : dime_reverse_13 . png ) ( along with replacing liberty with president roosevelt ) . 
  were the sickle and hammer common in european iconography before the soviet union made them their symbol ? 
  i recall standing in front of buckingham palace and seeing a statue on one side of my holding a sickle , and one on the other side , a statue holding a hammer . 
  i 've always found it fascinating that here in the u.s. , we have the symbol of fascism ( fasces ) on [ each side of the podium in the house of representatives . 
  ] ( http://drmcapitolgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cong.jpg ) somehow they do n't have the same stigma - if you tried to put a swastika , sickle & hammer , etc. 
  on the wall of the house , all hell would break loose . 
  what about austria and hungary , since they were historically tied together in the austro-hungarian empire , and their catholic history ? 
  thank you . 
  8 million you say !, 
  i 'm often surprised by how small the populations are in european countries , i suppose because we tend to think of them as being very densely populated . 
  i would 've guessed 10 million or more in austria . 
  i was also startled recently to discover that ireland has less than 5 million people ; again , i would have guessed 10-20 million . 
  if any of our friends abroad care to watch , [ here is the episode ] ( http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/christoph-waltz-champagne-cigars-and-pancake-batter ) ( i tested it with the vpn , it works with a german ip address , so hopefully it 's not blocked in other countries ) . 
  it also has gratuitous footage of a bmw 507 , and you get to see mr. waltz suffer through a visit to ihop . 
  that man is a treasure . 
  may we keep him ? 
  in both that interview and on comedians in cars getting coffee , he mentions humor , and his humor is quite understated . 
  i did n't realize there was a religious divide as well . 
  do you still see signs of the famous protestant work ethic in germany as opposed to austria ? 
  it seems that there has been a divide between historically protestant and historically catholic countries in europe ( the derogatory `` piigs '' epithet , for instance ) , but austria seems quite underrepresented in the news - no chancellor making headlines like angela merkel , no massive financial crisis like greece , no excruciatingly dramatic trials overlaid with superstitions like italy , no massive terror attacks like france ... from the american perspective , looking over , it seems something of a wallflower . 
  ( no offense intended to austrians . 
  i 'm curious about your country , as germany is always present in our concept of continental europe , but our views of austria are somewhat vague at best , and `` the other germany '' at worst ) . 
  i would see lithuania as the most vulnerable , if the russian government felt its access to kaliningrad were threatened . 
  the ukraine situation had much to do with strategic interests in the sevastopol . 
  for latvia and estonia , they 're more likely to just try to project soft power and manipulate the populace as they see fit . 
  i always have my phone with me already , and pulling it out is easier than digging trough my wallet and choosing the card i want at the moment ( 1debit +3 credit cards ) . 
  with applepay , i pull out my phone , flip between the desired cards on the screen , and hold my thumb over the reader to authenticate . 
  honestly , aldi reminded me of a tiny , tiny costco . 
  costco operates on a slightly different model ( club membership , bulk items aimed at businesses ) but uses many similar tactics ( no baggers , extreme cutting of overhead , single brands , store brands , no real effort at aesthetics in displaying items ) to keep costs down . 
  [ it 's bigger though ... ] ( http://media.columbian.com/img/photos/2013/10/09/03-07_c5_costco-minimumwage.jpg ) , and sells many items beyond groceries . 
  you can go in , buy tires , a tv , and perhaps a casket when you only meant to buy 10 lbs . 
  of butter . 
  out of curiosity , do you have anything like costco ( or sam 's club , it 's walmart-owned rival ) over there ? 
  apparently aldi nord is aldi , aldi s\u00fcd is trader joe 's here . 
  not exactly the same company , but cousins .
