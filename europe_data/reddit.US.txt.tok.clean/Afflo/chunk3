  does `` hole in the wall '' have the same connotations colloquially ( at least among english speakers ? ) . 
  `` hole in the wall '' in american english generally means a small business with a very modest physical footprint , often advertised by word of mouth ( e.g. 
  a tiny takeout restaurant ) . 
  dime is the only one without an intuitive value on it . 
  penny is a colloquial term ( borrowed from english pence ) , but the coin is labeled `` one cent '' nickel is a colloquial term ( based on the traditional metal makeup ) , but the coin is labeled `` five cents '' quarter is obvious , and labeled `` quarter dollar '' half dollars and silver dollars are so rare in everyday use that they 're not worth addressing . 
  dime is the only odd one , being labeled `` one dime '' ( from the french word for tithe ) . 
  that said , i ca n't help but imagine that having the value in cents written numerically would be easier for people who speak limited english , and our sizes are not intuitive . 
  it never occurred to me how odd our sizes are until i found myself in a shop in england with a handful of change , trying to pay , and realized the 20p was the size of a nickel , the 10p sized like a quarter , and the 5p sized like a dime . 
  yes , as do guam and american samoa . 
  ford has moved as of late toward integrating all their arms into one global ford motor company , at least with cars . 
  the focus , fiesta , and fusion ( mondeo ) are now globally using the same design . 
  it 's much smarter , and similar to what the japanese have long done . 
  if you design a car like the focus in the u.s. , they know it 's a cheap car for the low end of the market , and will design it as such to keep the costs in line . 
  in europe a car that size would be expected to be more refined . 
  it 's far easier to take an existing design and make a more basic version with fewer features and trim ( and the engineering costs already accounted for , or even better , shared between the markets ) , than to try to design a cheap compact car from scratch . 
  it took american carmakers far too long to understand this . 
  it has given them a bad reputation here , as their trucks and suv 's have typically been very good , but the cars are often half-effort afterthoughts . 
  and cadillac - it 's like buick . 
  they 've tried to renew the image , and maybe to kids they have , but just hearing the words , i think of giant sloshy boat-like cars that old people love . 
  my mother-in-law will part with her buick ( seats six , front bench seat ) when it can simply no longer function !, 
  and the jeep renegade - it 's a fiat wearing very well tailored jeep clothing . 
  i actually love the look of it , but i 'm waiting until fiat-chrysler gets its act together before even considering buying one . 
  what about jeep ? 
  i recall 10 years ago that a grand cherokee was an incredibly expensive vehicle in the u.k. . . more expensive than the land rover discovery . 
  here , the land rover discovery ( lr4 ) has a starting price that 's almost double the grand cherokee ( the jeep gc starts at $ 29,995 , or # 21,045 ) i definitely get the impression that the mustang is a premium product across the pond , rather than the aspirational car of choice for young 20 somethings that want a fun car before they settle down . 
   i think it 's a simple matter of capitalism capitalism is fine when we do it ... but when someone else takes it a step further , we go up in arms !, 
  i was on a tour of the tower of london about 11 years ago , and the beefeater giving the tour asked `` who is here from america ? '', 
  ( hands went up ) . 
  `` ireland ? '', 
  ( a few hands ) . 
  ( a large group of hands ) `` europe ? '', 
  ( uk hands go down and other hands go up ) . 
  `` not so fast brits , we are european . 
  ( lots of grumbling ) . 
  most houses have a water heater that heats the water in a large tank . 
  there 's hot water `` on tap , '' but it 's coming from a large boiler tank inside ( usually in a garage ) . 
  wow , that 's quite a difference . 
  at that price , i can see trying to cut down wherever possible . 
  as a follow up , do you mean kilowatt-hours ? 
  the going price per kwh in the u.s. is around 11 cents , and dryers average [ around 3.3 kwh per load , but vary from 1.5 - 5 kwh depending on the size and model ) . 
  ] ( http://homeguides.sfgate.com/average-cost-hour-run-dryer-68320.html ) if that 's kwh , it seems really high , unless that 's over the course of a certain amount of time ( x loss per week/month/year ) [ this chart shows kwh across different countries ] ( https://www.ovoenergy.com/binaries/content/gallery/ovowebsitessuite/images/guides/elec_prices_relative_to-pp__large-copy-6.png ) ... is it not including taxes ? 
  [ ( from ovoenergy.com ) ] ( https://www.ovoenergy.com/guides/energy-guides/average-electricity-prices-kwh.html ), 
  that is ... incredibly well thought out and efficient . 
  the beauty of reddit . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/m9ah5/why_do_most_americans_use_a_dryer_for_drying/ https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3hflu3/eli5_why_do_americans_use_dryers_for_their_clothes/ it seems like it comes up as a pretty frequent question , usually with the implication that having/using a dryer is unusual in european countries . 
  that 's the norm for apartment complexes i 've lived in here in the us as well - i 'll add , more often than not they 're coin operated - seems like they were usually $ 1 to wash , 25 cents / 15 mins of drying time . 
  the coin machines were always broken , so i 'd have to beg a cashier in a shop to sell me a roll of quarters . 
  i do n't have any data ... 
  it 's come up on reddit threads from time to time that drying clothes in a dryer seemed like a weird u.s. thing . 
  also , when visiting the u.k. about 10 years ago , an american friend and his wife who were living abroad mentioned that it was hard to find houses with dryers , or even hookups for dryers . 
  you 're not the first person to comment on dryers being expensive . 
  is there a reason for this ? 
  mine is a fairly cheap electric dryer , and i believe it was $ 350 new . 
  it costs about 36 cents in electricity to run it . 
  are there high taxes on dryers as luxury items ? 
  taxes on electricity ? 
  as for `` washing day , '' it 's not so much that we schedule a day - it 's more that my wife and i do all the laundry for the week/weeks ( we can easily go two weeks without washing clothes ) on a sunday afternoon and fold them as the loads come out ( usually while watching netflix ) . 
  it might be 3-4 loads , but we cycle them through pretty quickly and fold/hang them while the clothes are still warm so they do n't wrinkle . 
  we do n't usually have radiators over here , but i know from a visit to england about 11 years ago that there 's nothing quite as wonderful feeling as stepping out of the shower and grabbing a towel from the radiator . 
  do people tend to wash small loads daily rather than large multiple loads on a `` washing day ? '', 
  it seems that you 'd need multiple indoor clotheslines or , as / u/jlkng mentioned , clothes horses . 
  how long does it take ? 
  i 've hung stuff in the spare shower to dry , and even with that shower not being used , it still seems to take at least 8-16 hours for something to completely dry . 
  when you say investments , do you mean investments over a certain amount ? 
  or do 80 % of people have no investments such as iras , mutual funds , stocks , etc. ? 
  a part of the return process for us is using different strategies when paying taxes , and claiming various deductions , so , i have a few followup questions on this : - is there anything comparable to the irs w-4 , where you can set the withholding of taxes at the level you prefer ? 
  set it higher and you have a buffer against any surprises ; set it lower and you receive more in your pay , but may have to pay at the end of the tax year . 
  - charitable donations , as well as deductible expenses ( professional expenses , child care costs ) reduce your taxable income here . 
  are these handled automatically , or are they calculated as part of the return ? 
  - is there any equivalent to the mortgage interest deduction ( essentially , interest paid to a home mortgage is deducted from your taxable income ) . 
  - do you have a choice as to how you file ( married filing separately , married filing jointly , head of household , etc. ), 
  - is there an equivalent to a traditional ira ( contributions to an investment account are deducted from your taxable income , but must be kept in the account until a set age ) - is there any time where you can show proof of other taxes paid and use it as a deduction on your income tax ? 
  ( see the note below ) i know i 'm asking you directly , but these questions apply just as much to any other country who cares to answer . 
  in the u.s. , many states have their own income taxes in addition to federal income taxes and federal payroll taxes . 
  your may claim this as a deduction * in your federal taxes . 
  in the case of the u.k. , do you pay income taxes just to the national government , or do the constituent countries have their own income taxes as well ? 
  ( same question applies to other countries of europe - states , provinces , cantons , as the case may be ) . 
  thank you in advance . 
  i used to read my daughters edgar allan poe poems as bedtime stories , because i wanted my kids to be twisted and awesome . 
  indeed . 
  i never read 1984 in school , but i did read animal farm . 
  it seems like it 's a 50/50 chance whether your curriculum will include 1984 or brave new world ( mine had the latter ) . 
   twain 's known for tom sawyer and huckleberry finn , but not really for anything else . 
  i mentioned it in another response , but i 'm very fond of `` letters from earth . '', 
  it 's a very biting critique of both christianity and organized religion itself , and was n't released until the 1960 's , well after his death . 
  it was having a friend recommend it about 20 years ago that first turned my attention to twain as something other than `` the dead guy who wrote tom sawyer . '', 
  absolutely . 
  i read 1984 in one sitting , in an airport during a long layover , about a year after 9/11 . 
  an airport , with paranoid security everywhere , really added to its impact !, 
  no need to apologize !, 
  and thank you for the suggestions ... stevenson , defoe , verne , doyle ... all well known here as well . 
  huckleberry finn and tom sawyer are sadly what twain is best known for , but it 's his other books that have always intrigued me . 
  letters from earth is written as a series of letters from satan to his friends among the unfallen angels as he wanders the earth in exile , and is probably twain 's sharpest wit , though also most abrasive as he skewers organized religion . 
  innocents abroad * is his account of a tour across europe to palestine , making observations and mocking his fellow travel companions , as well as other travel writers grandiose descriptions . 
  the prince and the pauper and pudd ` head wilson explored `` trading places '' themes a century before , the latter being particularly critical of racism . 
  i guess i 'm asking about grand adventures in fiction and short stories , as well as biting wit and observation . 
  i 've read parts of de toqueville , and found some similarities in his observations of people . 
  * innocents abroad had my favorite twain quote : `` travel is fatal to prejudice , bigotry , and narrow-mindedness , and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts . 
  broad , wholesome , charitable views of men and things can not be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one 's lifetime . '' it 's no less true today than a century ago . 
  also ... this is the first i 've ever heard of donald duck magazine .
