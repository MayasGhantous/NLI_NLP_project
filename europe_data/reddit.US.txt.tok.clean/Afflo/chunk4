  cool , thanks !, 
  it does n't get very hot , or at least not for very long there , so it makes sense that you would n't use the a/c a lot . 
  i bet the sea breeze is wonderful ... 
  i miss living near the coast . 
  what what is the weather like in the area where you live ? 
  friends who have visited always comment that , other than the interior , the weather is wonderful - like a giant southern california ( desert interior with very comfortable coastal weather where most people live ) . 
   the new uk class system thanks ... that was fascinating . 
  i have a layman 's interest in sociology and language , and once you dig past the cultural arguments and irritating teenagers spouting off for giggles , reddit is an incredible way to explore the world . 
  just for fun , i tried it out , and i seem to have broken it , because based on my answers , it thinks i 'm a member of the elite who went to a private school and an elite university . 
  it 's somewhat reminiscent of having a friend who immigrated from the u.k. ( croydon , i believe ) take the [ new york times ' dialect quiz ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/20/sunday-review/dialect-quiz-map.html ) . 
  edit : if you 're curious , [ this ] ( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/41yqozzbhil._sy344_bo1,204,203,200_.jpg ) is one of the better descriptions of the u.s. class system ( which we all know exists but is taboo to discuss ) . 
  some of the details come off as a bit dated now , but the underlying premise still stands . 
  unless they 're away for college , living at home is pretty common for young adults in the u.s. as well . 
  it becomes somewhat stigmatized once a person is in their upper 20 's ( thus the `` living in mom 's basement '' jokes , '' ) but is still not that unusual . 
  supporting your kids while they travel the world and not turning their bedroom into a guest room or den are n't quite the same thing . 
  traveling is expensive !, 
  it seems based on the answers ( u.k. sweden , denmark , netherlands ) that 's it 's more a northern europe phenomenon ? 
   sure you see the similarities between english and german . 
  it 's one of the reasons why learning english is n't that difficult for us . 
  i read a lot in middle high german ( german from the middle ages ) and there are words which are n't used in modern german anymore but in english . 
  ( l\u00fctzel -  little for example ) . 
  what languages are , on average , easiest for german speakers to learn ? 
  it 's taken as a matter of faith that spanish is the easiest language for ( american ) english speakers , but i imagine that is mostly due to shared ( and similarly spelled ) words of latin origin , and the fact that it 's the most useful language for many americans ( approximately 4 in 10 residents of my city speak spanish at home , and about 1 in 4 in the state - texas ) . 
  thanks for posting that . 
  funny enough , scots is n't hard for me to understand , aside from the vocabulary . 
  it takes a moment for me to listen to it and get a feel for the vowels ( which are all shifted quite a bit ) and the rhythm , but the consonants are all sharp . 
  accents from devon/cornwall sound closer to general american than any of the others . 
  if i hear r 's pronounced like ours , it 's generally a good bet that they 're from the west country ( and people are generally surprised and pleased that i picked up on this ) . 
  that said , i 've traveled enough , and watch enough international tv that i can usually adapt pretty easily to strong accents . 
  except scouse . 
  that 's like another language !, 
  tell me what you think of these . 
  i 'd be curious how easily the come to a uk anglophone .

  [ gullah geechee storyteller ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0dgijyigqu ) - gullah is a dialect from the southern atlantic coast . 
  i thought twice about posting it , because it seems fairly easy to understand to me , but i grew up near [ that area ] ( http://www.sott.net/image/s7/155843/full/new_map.jpg ) , and it 's not so different from the local black vernacular english . 
  ( black american dialects , loosely grouped together as african-american vernacular english , or aave , is particularly fascinating to me . 
  still very stigmatized , it 's a bona fide dialect with its own [ unique tense/aspect system ] ( http://africanamericanenglish.com/2010/05/19/5-present-tenses-of-aae/ ) . 
  waltz has almost no other noticeable accent . 
  it 's actually rather unsettling - his english speech is almost like a verbal uncanny valley . 
  you know he 's not a native speaker , but you ca n't put your finger on anything that 's actually wrong . 
  that 's interesting ... the moment i heard him , all i could think of was `` gold member '' from austin powers . 
  it 's obviously a play on the same common esl tell , but something i did n't notice when i saw that movie as an untraveled 20 something . 
  of course , thinking of both your `` sloppy s '' as you call it , and kitchy spy the biggest tells from german esl speakers usually revolve around speaking it too well . 
  sometimes the dipthongs are slightly off , but it usually every consonant perfectly expressed , without the usual assibilations like `` innernet '' ( internet ) , `` bidd\u0259r '' ( bitter ) or `` buh ` n '' ( button ) . 
  they 're so common in ( american ) english that we do n't notice it when we do it , but immediately hear it when it 's not there !, 
  edit : can you give an example of the ui vowel ? 
  as an aside ... 
  the rolled spanish r ( rr ) is n't that challenging for me , but the single r is difficult to discern ( and pronounce ) . 
  to my ears , it sounds more like a very quick , very light `` d '' sound . 
   but there are some interesting features to german which english has lost . 
  verbs always go in the second position , unless in a dependent clause , in which case they go last . 
  ** whether you put the subject and object first and third or third and first is up to you , depending on what you want to emphasize . 
  ** `` my homework ate my dog , because he faster than i is . '', 
  is the verb conjugated in a different way to show that it 's passive ? 
  we can do that in english too , though we have no way to conjugate passive verbs other than extra particles . 
  - my dog ate my homework . 
  - my homework * was * eaten * by * my dog .

  go torrenting for his podcasts ?

  is there a linguistic ( rather than political ) difference between dutch low saxon and west low german ? 
  the maps seem to overlap ... is that dialect a sort of transitory dialect between dutch and german speaking areas ? 
  how different are these dialect from west frisian ? 
  i 've often seen west frisian described as the closest sister language to english , save for scots ... which may be regarded as a language or dialect depending on the source . 
  if i hear it ... it 's confusing because i feel like i * should * understand it , and if i see it written , it definitely triggers the part of my brain that says `` you know this , '' but other than fragments , i do n't get much from it . 
  edit : for example ... [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/t8lxrfdlrlu?t=5m3s ) sounds so much like english that i ca n't help but try to understand , like hearing an unfamiliar accent from the north of england . 
  i 've been listening to a podcast series called [ `` history of english '' ] ( http://historyofenglishpodcast.com/ ) that delves into the history of the english language from it 's roots in proto-indo-european , the evolution of ie languages through the greek and latin periods , and the growth of germanic languages . 
  the differences between high and low german were discussed , and i was surprised to learn that regional dialects are still quite marked . 
  [ wikipedia provides this map of the current distribution of german . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_dialects#/media/file:continental_west_germanic_languages.png ) i have some questions about these dialects , and german in general : - how much does day-to-day language vary ? 
  is it better thought of as a continuum between the dialects , where you notice little difference from one area to the next , but over greater distances it becomes harder to communicate ? 
  - following up on this ... are dutch dialects distinct , or is there a continuum where regional dialects in the netherlands are mutually intelligible with adjacent dutch dialects ? 
  - is use of the regional dialects common among younger people , or has standard german become more common in day to day life ? 
  - as an english speaker , i can often see the common roots with german words when i read or hear german , but not to the point of being useful in any way . 
  do you see the same in english ? 
  is the relationship as a fellow germanic tongue obvious ( aside from the considerable influence of french vocabulary ) ? 
  one extra question ... 
  there 's a dialect of german that is orphaned and dying in central texas . 
  [ ( bbc article with video ) ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22490560 ) . 
  is this easily understood to a modern german speaker ? 
  the concept of a gap year is not well known in the u.s. , and taking time between secondary school and university education is frowned upon ( or at least it was when i was graduating . ), 
  what is the norm for gap years across the countries of europe ? 
  are they typically a thing for people with family ( upper-middle class ) means to support them ? 
  would they be out of reach to a student from a working class or lower-middle-class background * ? 
  is it typically a `` work abroad for a spell '' type of thing , or focused more on traveling and soaking as many cultural experiences as possible ? 
  * i 'm using the american sense of socioeconomic classes , as i 'm not terribly certain how the lines convert : - working class - wage earners , tradesmen , no university education . 
  - lower middle-class - bachelors degree or equivalent , salaried , semi-professional career , office/managerial work . 
  - upper middle-class - members of a profession - masters degree or equivalent , salaried or charge clientele by the hour . 
  lawyers , doctors , professors , executives , etc.
