  on the 7th of may at [ 7 pm bst ] ( http://time.is/bst ) , 8pm cest , 11am civilized human time ( i.e. 
  pst ) we start a new eu4 campaign . 
  the game will last 4 hours per session . 
  anyways , you can drop off at any time before that . 
  no hard feelings !, 
  we only ask to please take a major nation only if you 're going to be sticking it out with us regularly , because major nations , at least at first , affect the balance of the game a lot and it 'll be more fun for everyone if they do n't get imploded by the ai . 
  if you reserve a nation in this thread , you will have first pick to it when we play on saturday . 
  * p.s. 
  no reason you ca n't become the most powerful starting from a minor nation - that actually happened in the last game . 
  * ** to join : ** [ this is / r/europe 's steam group ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/europereddit ) . 
  it is open for anyone to join so you do n't even need an invitation . 
  there are two ways to join the actual game . 
  ** first way : ** once you are in , we can invite you , just remind us to in the steam group 's chat . 
  you can also directly join by clicking join game on someone already in the lobby that is also in the group chat . 
  ** second way : ** [ mudcrabmerchant ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977924837/ ) , that 's me !, 
  might be hosting . 
  if i do n't i will know the host , and be the first person in the game after them . 
  either way , if you add me on steam , you can join the game through me by : * entering eu4 and going into the multiplayer window ( if you were in single player , you need to restart eu4 ) * open your friends list where i am . 
  * click on my profile * click join game button as pictured here [ friend profile ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oiyscji.png ) ( that is n't my profile , just an example ) ** faq : ** * - do we use some sort of communication tool ? 
  * yes !, 
  for anything other than super secret plots ( for which we recommend eu4 's whisper and chat groups functionality ) , we use teamspeak . 
  you do n't have to join it , but we strongly recommend it . 
  if you do n't know how to set it up , please ask . 
  the teamspeak server details are : address : 185.4.149.102:9152 room : eu4game password : europe ** - what happens if i miss a session ? 
  can i come back ? 
  ** ** answer : ** absolutely !, 
  the usual rule is that you can also pick any nation unless someone played it previously , in which case , that someone has priority . 
  but if he is n't there when we play , you can take it for at least that session . 
  if an absentee going to be late to a session and do n't want to lose your nation please post in the weekly thread so we know you wo n't be showing up . 
  if you give notice , you can miss ** one ** whole session and still have the right to your nation when you come back . 
  ** - i can only join for 3 hours , not 4 , is that fine ? 
  ** ** answer : ** then join for 3 hours and leave before 4 . 
  that 's fine  ** - i came 10 minutes late and you have already started / i crashed / i got annexed and disconnected , what do ? 
  ** ** answer : ** we will be playing with a ton of people . 
  that means we unfortunately ca n't be restarting every time someone joins or disconnects . 
  we will be having ~ 2 restarts total for everyone that came late or crashed to be able to rejoin , so it 's not the end of the world . 
  in general the first one will be around 21:15 cest ** - i am bad at this game ** you are absolutely welcome !, 
  most of us were n't experienced players in the last game and we had a ton of fun with a lot of wars , plots , politics , etc. 
  ** - i have never played this game before ** you are also absolutely welcome but ... you probably wo n't enjoy this . 
  the game is super complicated and you wo n't understand most things and a 20-40 player game is usually a wild west mess so that would make it even harder to understand . 
  i would personally suggest skipping this week and trying the game in sp first - and then join us once you know at least some basics . 
  it is really fun !, 
  ** - my internet is trash , can i join anyway ? 
  ** ** answer : ** sure but ... your internet probably ca n't handle it if it 's really bad . 
  if you slow down the game too much , it 's not practical to participate . 
  we need to keep a consistent speed 2 and if you ca n't handle that ... sorry . 
  if you are not sure , feel free to join and see how it goes  *************************** ** - rules ? 
  ** answer : we 're figuring out the ideal ruleset as we go . 
  there will be some changes from last time , mostly surrounding player alliances . 
  * ** we are probably removing the basic player alliance limit . 
  ** you used to be limited strictly to 2 player alliances . 
  the rule was more or less useless , as we could easily coordinate larger blocks of player nations anyway . 
  the following rules are up for consideration . 
  please discuss them in the comments below - we will pick a finalized rule set before the game starts , taking into account your feedback . 
  top 3 ca n't ally 2 . 
  gps are top 8 and a gp can only have 1 other gp ally , non gps are limited to 2 gp allies . 
  gps are reduced to top 6 at 1650 , potentially not counted post 1750 and only the top 3 ca n't ally rule remains . 
  alliance limit is either lifted or set at dip relations slots/slots -1 . 
  could also just be a plain you + 3/4 people if people prefer that . 
  bringing a new ally in during a war is not allowed except via enforce peace . 
  if you pick a vassal or pu in the first round ( rule in regards to picking pu/vassal kept ) you have to achieve independance within 2 sessions/60years failure to do so or a failed independance war means losing control of your nation . 
  cn rules kept , limitation to nations supporting independance should match alliance limitations . 
  no timelimit on achieving independance alternatively very late game time limit 8 . 
  being force-vassalized/force-pu 'd means game over . 
  pu by monarch death should be either immediately dissolved or a similar limitation to starting subjects . 
  ex 30 years to get independance or so . 
  ** addendum to the above rules : ** the spirit of the rules above mean that you are n't supposed to be alliance jumping . 
  you ca n't simply quickly break an alliance to ally someone else just to intervene in a war . 
  if you want to defend/attack someone with some other player , you either have to ally them beforehand , you can guarantee them ( which does not count towards alliance limits ) , you can `` enforce peace '' or you can simply declare a seperate war . 
  seperate war is important because if the attacked nation surrenders to one of the aggressors , they have to accept so they can turn on you , making ganking up more risky . 
  breaking alliances in peacetime is , of course , fully allowed . 
  it is also fully allowed to not defend an ally that is attacked . 
  * ** how do you pick the top six ? 
  ** we have our own formula , that reflects real power better than the in-game score . 
  basically , your income , land forcelimits , and naval forcelimits matter , in that order . 
  subject force limits may count in some way from this session on . 
  * ** after the first round , you are not allowed to pick a vassal or pu ( personal union ) of a player nation without the permission of that player . 
  ** you can pick one at the 1st round 's start though . 
  * ** you are allowed to play a player 's colonial nation ( i.e. 
  thirteen colonies in eastern america ) once those are created . 
  ** however , you are limited to two nations supporting your independence , and if you lose your independence war , you lose control of the colonial nation and it has to stay ai . 
  glory is there for those who seize the opportunity , but choose wisely !, 
  * ** try to be a sporting player . 
  ** this is more of a suggestion since this can hardly be enforced . 
  you are of course allowed ( and encouraged ) to declare war on whoever you think , and take what suits you and what you can conquer !, 
  do try and play fair ( ish ) at least , do n't deliberately gank people with like 5 separate alliances on your side , try not to crush someone completely at the very beginning of the game ( unless it 's like you 're castille and he 's navarra because that 's natural ) , etc. 
  do n't abuse exploits if you find any or consistently try to bypass the house rules . 
  feel free to plot and scheme with/against players though , it 's one of the most fun parts of the game !, 
  * ** no nation ruining . 
  ** if someone surrenders ( by saying ` i surrender ' in general chat ) , you have to offer them a peace deal at maximum 100 warscore . 
  taking more than 100 warscore per war from players is not allowed . 
  have fun !, 
  ** p.s. 
  feel free to ask any question regarding this mp game or eu4 in general in this thread or anywhere else . 
  do n't be afraid to ask !, 
  ** ** the savegame is on the new patch so make sure your game is up to date !!, 
  ** remember , all player use the host 's dlc , so you do n't need to own even one . 
  good luck to all the attendees of this week !, 
  ** game postponed till next week ** i 'm retarded and forgot to post this thread until 5 hours before the game started , so we did n't get enough people . 
  the game will continue at the regular time next week , and i will make a thread on time .
