  because kazakhstan is the only other member than belarus in putin 's eurasian union . 
  3 reasons , two that have to do with situation and one which kinda has to do with the situation . 
  any potential war between nuclear powers would be a limited , quick & decisive war so as to avoid escalation * ( which can very possibly happen anyway ) * for the very reason you just mentioned . 
  so that requires a advanced military that has proficient power projection capabilities and can respond to a regional crisis quickly . 
  crimea is the perfect example of this . 
  you go in , win a few short battles/actions , occupy and than threaten nuclear war to whoever tries to dislodge you once you set-up camp & secured your position . 
  those few short battles/action will probably be what determines future wars in my opinion . 
  it shows solidarity & commitment to germany 's eastern european eu/nato allies . 
  even if it 's only symbolic , it 's very important . 
  it also aides with building a strong , broad eu foreign policy as the members feel they can rely on & trust germany . 
  it will put germany in a better position to help it 's other eu/nato allies , france & the united kingdom , in things like mali & libya , both of which were called for by european powers . 
  if germany wants to see the eu integrate , for a common foreign policy to be established & a consolidated military to actually exist , it needs to actually aid france & britain in helping maintain regional stability instead of forcing them to rely on america . 
  a consolidated military & single foreign policy , which i think something like this would encourage , would happy heavily in something like ukraine in my opinion . 
  how about germany leaves the european union if it 's going to side with foreign powers in the pursuit of it 's national interests instead of with it 's fellow member-states in the pursuit of everybody 's supranational interests ? 
  germany 's * all for * the * greater good * of the european union when it comes to imposing austerity , straying a thin line with deflation & undervaluing their exports to the economic determinant of their neighbors , but fuck me if it becomes economically determinant to * germany itself * . 
  than it 's unfair & germany has no reason to risk it 's bottom line . 
  all that bullshit about integration , european brotherhood , the greater good & all that other jazz goes out the window . 
  and you might not want to alienate russia . 
  that 's fine . 
  but russia does n't give a fuck what you think nor will they take you seriously until you show them your serious . 
  germany has failed in this regard not only with it 's woeful & inadequate hard power , but also because it 's refused to reassure and act in solidarity with it 's eastern european allies , let alone actually utilize it 's soft power . 
  say what you want , but germany is alienating eastern europe with it 's refusal to actually expand it 's military and back them up militarily when they ask * ( even if it 's only a symbol ) * and showing russia it 's weak by not being willing to take a economic hit through using it 's soft power . 
  i mean ffs if germany is going to say fuck hard power , they should at least double down on soft power . 
  but germany refuses * to even do that * . 
  * begin aggressively pursuing a eu energy union as was suggested earlier this year by poland * increase military spending to 2 % of their gdp as recommended by nato & develop more adequate power projection capabilities to help instill confidence from neighboring countries in germany 's military . 
  * show more commitment to the baltic nations ; even if it means stationing extra military units there . 
  sure , it 'd irritate russia , but it 'd show solidarity with germany 's eu/nato allies . 
  * if you 're going to talk softly , make sure you 're willing to use your big stick ; as in , germany should be more willing to use heavy-handed economic sanctions against russia . 
  * if russia continues to supply , fund & train the rebels , do the same with ukrainian government . 
  begin sharing intelligence , preparing foreign aid packages , weapons deals & possibly give support to a nato training mission in a one of the baltic countries to help train ukranian military personnel . 
  you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
  i do n't see many pretty outcomes to this situation . 
  but it does make germany chose between it 's national interests & it 's supranational interests ; it 's economic interests & it 's political interests . 
  it shows russia if they 're going to be working with the european union as a nonfactor that can be ignored , or as a actual state capable of exercising actual influence that has to be considered . 
  the german economy ? 
  the one which uses the euro to undervalue german exports & undercut it 's neighbors competitiveness ? 
  the one with a irrationally religious fear of inflation ? 
  the one using it 's influence with the ecb to inadvertently push the continent that much closer to deflation ? 
  and the eu handout programs ? 
  you mean when germany pushed the eu to give the southern nations a credit card without limit , with which to buy german exports , and then pretended they had nothing to do with it when the bill came due ? 
  when the eu loaned greece tens of billion , and then german banks moved to demand repayment of hundreds of billions ? 
  followed by :  * `` i want to find a way , as many others do , which does not damage russia . 
  we [ germany ] want to have good trade relations with russia as well . 
  we want reasonable relations with russia . 
  we are depending on one another and there are so many other conflicts in the world where we should work together , so i hope we can make progress '' *  --------------------------------------------------------------  but earlier on saturday in kiev , merkel also indicated she is willing to make trade concessions to moscow . 
  * `` this [ trade ] is of greatest importance to russia . 
  i think , this has an importance beyond pure economics , it also has a psychological importance '' * , she said . 
   ---------------------------------------------------------------  noting that german energy firm rwe this weekend sold an oil and gas extraction company , dea , to russian firm letterone in a deal worth $ 5.1 billion , one eu diplomat told this website : * `` there are signs germany is seeking a return to peace and to business as usual at any price ... even if this means putting off ukraine 's ratification of the eu free trade pact '' * . 
  the subtext is pretty clear . 
  there was a leak a while ago that corroborated it . 
  [ ** wikileaks : france leads russia , china in industrial spying in europe ** ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/wikileaks-france-leads-russia-china-in-industrial-spying-in-europe/ )  france is the country that conducts the most industrial espionage on other european countries , even ahead of china and russia , according to leaked u.s. diplomatic cables , reported in a translation by agence france presse of norwegian daily aftenposten 's reporting . 
   * `` french espionage is so widespread that the damages ( it causes ) the german economy are larger as a whole than those caused by china or russia , '' * an undated note from the u.s. embassy in berlin said . 
   in october , 2009 , berry smutny , the head of german satellite company ohb technology , is quoted in the diplomatic note as saying : * `` france is the empire of evil in terms of technology theft , and germany knows it . 
  '' *  the cable discusses ohb 's contract for the galileo satellite navigation system , a european challenger to the american-developed global positioning system ( gps ) , afp reports . 
  ** russia & turkey signed & ratified the echr , which is a convention between the member-states of the council of europe . 
  russia & turkey are members of the council of europe . 
  the council of europe is not the european union , & the european union is not the council of europe . 
  why ? 
  it 's a stupid comparison . 
  comparing the echr & the council of europe to the constitution & the united states in a serious matter is retarded . 
  comparing the two documents in general to each other is retarded . 
  now do you got something to contribute to the conversation or are you just going to whine like a bitch about me shutting up ? 
  lol, 
  that 's true and i 'm not going to deny it . 
  i 'd also add in the fact that interpretations change , and the language of the constitution is broad enough to allow a decent number of interpretations * ( and one of the reasons i think it 's lasted so long despite how much we 've changed ) * . 
  sometimes cases are so hot & interpretations so polarizing that scotus does n't want to touch them with a 10 foot pool until they feel the time is right or their hand is pretty much forced . 
  but i do really respect the fact that the constitution gives them the authority to unilaterally strike down * ( unconstitutional ) * laws passed by congress & signed by the president as a check against both . 
  i like the balance it brings to the separate government branches . 
  i do n't really see that as a bad thing & do n't understand why people would see it as useless . 
  and that would be a unilateral action by the executive branch trying to cover up it 's actions from the judicial branch . 
  an it 's forced to do that because it can get into trouble due to the authority & auspices the constitution delegates to the judicial branch . 
  i still do n't see what you 're getting at . 
  americans ' view of the constitution is bad because adherence to the constitution causes the government to cover up certain actions because it 'd get in trouble with the constitution ? 
  that 's a bad thing ? 
  lol if he 's stupid he 's american, 
  go get me when you can enforce the echr on russia & turkey like we can do with the constitution on california & texas . 
  also , get me when you consolidate the eu completely into a actual country and also completely integrate russia & turkey . 
  an when did a international convention * centered on * human rights become equal to a nation 's founding document which * includes * human rights ? 
  does the echr also dictate the working organs , checks and balances , powers , limits & responsibilities of a nation ? 
  i think * `` semi-federal '' * is a cop-out . 
  devolved powers are actually a hallmark of unitary nations , so i do n't think i 'd be wrong to say that the united kingdom has been unitary in it 's treatment of scotland and while what you say about legislative power may be true , that legislative power is still * devolved * through and * given * by westminster , which many scottish individuals , iirc , do n't agree with because they feel it does n't allot scotland it 's appropriate representation , whether in domestic * or * foreign matters as far as uk-wide issues go . 
  than what are you suggesting ? 
  is the constitution not the one thing we have if actions like that are popularly supported ? 
  what other thing can we rely on if the majority , and legislature , approve of those things ? 
  that all depends on your interpretation . 
  and there are many things i would probably agree with your interpretation on . 
  but that 's not the point . 
  the point is that the constitution grants the supreme court the authority & ability to nullify those laws even if they 're voted in by the legislature & signed by the president . 
  that 's something i support and a stipulation i do not want to forfeit . 
  i mean , for example ; if the german government ever did something that went against it 's basic law , and got away with it , do you think that the basic law should be abolished because of it ? 
  the logic makes no sense . 
  that 's a dumb comparison .
