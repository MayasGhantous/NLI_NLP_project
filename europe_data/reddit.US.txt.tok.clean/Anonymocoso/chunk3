  ] ( https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2016-03/wada-statement-regarding-chinese-swimming-doping-claims ) but russia will generate some big money for us executives in basketball , athletics ( track and field ) , gymnastics , boxing and other sports . 
  what are more americans going to watch ? 
  - us - russia in olympic basketball ? 
  - us - slovenia in olympic basketball ? 
  which situation will attract more us viewers to olympic gymnastics ? 
  - the us is 0.1 points behind the russian team ? 
  - the us far behind the chinese and the romanians and headed for 3rd place ? 
  us television will make more money if russian athletes and teams are competing against us athletes and teams . 
  austrian-rules football would be fun . 
  you have to kick the ball between sets of skis located at the end of the field . 
  part of my wife 's job is going through social media and looking for pictures of people who are `` too disabled to work '' but who can go skiing , mountain biking , ride atv 's , etc. 
  not bad . 
  not perfect , though . 
  colorado and washington have big cities . 
  wyoming has oil field workers that get drunk and shoot each other . 
  but everyone loves arroz con pollo . 
  look at the usa , which states have the lowest murder rate ? 
  utah , idaho , new hampshire , vermont , minnesota ; the states with good or at least passable skiing . 
  you can ski on hawaii , on the big island at the top of the mountain and hawaii has one of the lowest murder rates in the country . 
  in a few years , spain will be competitive against japan , the us and the dominican republic in the world cup of baseball .

  the taxes that my hotel or restaurant manager pays end up in a cayman islands bank account .

  the primary `` dark tactic '' was that the democrats nominated a former member of walmart 's board of directors who had accepted money from a certain disreputable casino owner and from middle eastern countries with horrifying human rights records . 
  this candidate also insulted people who were thinking about voting for her opponent . 
  if the liberal/leftist/social democratic candidate in the race has even a semblance of credibility , a trump-like candidate wo n't win . 
  granted , the filipinos i meet are not necessary representative of the population as a whole . 
  but the ones i meet here are devout christians , love the usa and are grateful to live here . 
  it 's strange to see a russian newspaper that agrees with american christian republicans . 
  i would definitely be a refugee in slovenia . 
  i live in utah so i have to buy booze from the state monopoly mafia . 
  and park city wants me to pay us$ 100 for a lift ticket .

  tim mcveigh spent some time in the middle east in the army and he once told an interviewer than he is agnostic . 
  so he no longer counts as a white christian terrorist . 
  our boston marathon bombers were refugees . 
  [ this happened 20 km away from me . 
  there was no evidence that it was terrorism , but the killer was a refugee and the victims are no less dead .

  the crime rate per capita in some of the rural states is lower , too . 
  but the `` intermountain west '' states with easy access to guns have a japan - level suicide rate . 
  some of the rural states with easy access to guns ( utah , idaho , iowa ) have lower murder rates than states with stricter laws against guns ( california , new york ) in the us , a relatively low murder rate seems to coincide with good or at least passable skiing . 
  you can even ski on the big island of hawaii . 
  boomtown , furnacetown and goldtown sound like mining towns in the western part of north america . 
  at the risk of betraying my age , i remember when other countries were going to take advantage of ronald reagan ' s lack of foreign policy experience . 
  i did n't vote for trump . 
  he is a performance artist with a furry animal on his head .
