hussites ( we say moravians ) founded my city in north carolina . 
  however , we get not such day off , of course . 
  here , they are widely revered for their [ cookies ] ( https://www.salembaking.com/catalog/addimages/hsp16t_product.jpg ) , [ cakes ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.oldsalem.org/images/uploads/83101new-l.jpg ) , and [ christmas decor ] ( http://hgtvhome.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/hgtv/fullset/2013/7/29/1/bpf_holiday-house_exterior_moravian_stars_beauty_wide_view_h.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.966.725.jpeg ) . 
  yes , our guide told us about that earthquake i think . 
  was it during mass maybe ? 
  i unfortunately missed tuscany , but i loved umbria as well . 
  best food and friendliest people . 
  and full of american monks !, 
  the relatively new monastary there is about 70 % american i think . 
  i attended a beautiful latin mass there in 2014 , and a texan monk told us about how hard it was to tell his girlfriend he was making monastic vows . 
  i believe they brew the only beer in europe made entirely by monks , with no secular workers . 
  unfortunately , their church was destroyed in an earthquake last year , with only the fa\u00e7ade standing . 
  officially , the italian state took all of rome , even if they did not raid and break into the vatican . 
  only in 1929 with the lateran treaty did the vatican city become independent . 
  well , in the us things are often happening at a precinct by precinct level , with fewer votes to count . 
  they are projecting plaid cymru . 
  does anyone have an exit poll that specifies the 18 `` others '' ? 
  curious about ni . 
  yes , you can , just like us !, 
  once you do , you 'll start eating chicken fingers with ketchup and elect reality tv stars/failed marketing execs to your highest offices with that in mind , i suggest europe shows that someone gives a damn about international law and human decency , even if we ca n't . 
  it 's not so much that the us is anti-nato , but that trump does n't currently understand that alliances are n't sold to the highest bidder , [ except when they are . 
  ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/20/us-saudi-arabia-seal-weapons-deal-worth-nearly-110-billion-as-trump-begins-visit.html ) there is practically no support for abandoning nato in congress , and trump ignoring article 5 is unlikely , as it 's an impeachable offence . 
  i know a local cheese producer that does [ pseudo-parmigiano reggiano ] ( http://www.goatladydairy.com/cheese-products.php ) , and it 's very good . 
  the parmesan cheese in our stores have [ woodpulp ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/17/parmesan-cheese-store-bought-wood-pulp ) . 
  are all italians cheese experts , or is it a specialty of yours . 
  a lovely hue !, 
  i will say , trader joe 's definitely does n't have local cheese where i am . 
  all of theirs is imported or 100 % californian . 
  in north carolina , despite plentiful cows , most local cheese is sheep or goat , not that that 's a bad thing . 
  i think they just think it 's chic . 
  it is true , but there are communities in east coast states , specially in the mountains , that live like albanians , with no jobs or hope of any coming , just a few hours from wealthy cities and industrial work . 
  it 's a madly diverse place . 
  the whole southwest has grown in size and wealth lately , from arizona to texas . 
  `` coast '' is a very relative term in the us . 
  some of those schools , especially in the southeast , are 4 or 5 hours from the ocean , yet , it 's still the coast . 
  and people are using that phrase more and more . 
  somehow , over the course of the last 2 years , i 've gone from being a southerner to a east coast elite . 
  who 'd a thunk it ? 
  that 's what they claim they are gon na do here when they open them stateside . 
  trader joe 's ( aldi ) does it , while still letting me find calabrian buffalo mozzarella . 
  and a significant amount within the united states . 
  but currently without membership in the bundestag . 
  haley was one of a number of republicans who did not endorse trump . 
  that sort of `` bargaining/negotiating '' is common place in america where politicians are for sale . 
  he just tells everyone about it while other politicians have to worry about being thought of as corrupt . 
  trump voters think he 's too rich to be corrupt . 
  yeah , nothing gay in europe makes sense . 
  my gaydar goes off at every european guy i see , and dolce and gabbana think gay marriage is a bad idea . 
  i 'm familiar with the strong rightward tilt of the usa , but far-right , whenever i hear it in a european context , it always seems to be about xenophobia and strong social conservatism . 
  i know that being against marriage equality and abortion are not unheard of in the european center-right , depending on the country . 
  she is the one who took down the confederate flag on the south carolina capitol building . 
  as far as i am aware , standard republican economic policy has n't existed in europe since chamberlain , even in far-right parties . 
  the front national & afd are not uber-neo-liberal or libertarian in the way the republicans are . 
  ukip may lean that way , but they are of a different breed than the continental far-right . 
  i 'm not an expert on european politics , so correct me if i am wrong . 
  she is completely unknown by any name but nikki haley , is not far-right , is no longer governor , and i have met several people from south carolina who thought she was american indian . 
  the republican party * can * be far-right with people like donald trump or ted cruz , and while she is hardly center-right , she is from a different wing than those two . 
  do you think that its proximity to an established holiday is at all a factor ? 
  that 's why we speak ~ ~ correctly ~ ~ differently , while aussis , kiwis & south africans speak more similarly to rp than scouse . 
  i 'm more concerned about the ritual fighting afterwords . 
  if i remember and interview he did , they decided for him to do an american accent on set , after they decided it did n't work . 
  also , til eric clapton is a brit . 
  and when latin americans want to take a jab at us , they usually settle for `` gringo . '', 
  estadounidense is a lovely spanish work which is occasionally used . 
  my hometown has the word `` rural '' and is usually pronounced as ruh-ruhl ( with a schwa ; how i say it ) , roo-uhl , potentially as rurl , or however you like , really . 
  when i went to italy , in a group of 25 american ( and 1 panamanian ) students , people would constantly ask us if we were australian . 
  i assumed it was because they 'd think other anglophones might be offended to be thought of as american . 
  personally , i have more trouble telling the more mild aussi , kiwi , and irish accents from regional or working class british accents . 
  yeah , that does n't seem like a tenable situation , nor does it fall in line even with catholic teaching . 
  there is do demand to keep anyone on a ventilator , only to feed/hydrate them , so far as i have understood . 
  might i ask what `` interruption of care '' means ? 
  can you not refuse some forms of medical care ? 
  i thought \u017di\u017eek was a serb !, 
  maybe that 's why he `` endorsed '' trump . 
  all young , educated americans hear about slovenia is that it 's beautiful and great to hike there . 
  european social liberalism = / = american libertarianism . 
  social liberal is what the democratic party claims to be , and often is , [ despite also claiming to be a big tent from far-left to center-right . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6fq6sh/based_on_his_political_platform_would_bernie/ ) libertarians range from the cosmopolitan right that just want to smoke weed , be contrarian and not pay taxes , and the toxically orthodox who say they support liberal values , but are usually conservatives who do n't mind gay people and think roads and schools are dangerous government intervention . 
  it 's such an american buzzword ( buzzterm ? ) . 
  we 've got one of the most punitive justice systems in the civilized world , and this is a common election phrase . 
  one should read it as `` retribution and madness . '', 
  in the cofe it 's the feast of the circumcision/holy name of jesus . 
  never would have thought whitmonday/pentecost monday would be a french holiday . 
  though , at least at my school , in college it was not uncommon to attend a large frat party without connections , depending on how much of a male/female ratio they were going for . 
  that is the sort of byzantine structure i would have not have expected from a government created in the 20th century . 
  who decided this ? 
  i remember this being in the news here quite a bit . 
  trying to fit square pegs in round holes trying to compare it to the us election . 
  and one us state , nebraska . 
  well , the house of lords is very much an upper house , it might be the original one , but nothing like the us senate ( though it 's function in the 18th century inspired the senate , which almost had lifetime terms ) . 
  do constitutional changes happen often enough for them to be relevant ? 
  our presidential elections are every four years on the tuesday after the first monday of november , without exception . 
  we do not have snap elections or recall elections . 
  we can have special elections ( by-elections ) for congress or state offices , but the presidency has a line of succession , as mentioned by u/das _ intp_drummer , though it is actually speaker of the house ( closest thing to an american prime minister ) that immediately follows the president and vice president in succession , though it used to be the president pro tempore of the senate . 
  the most dangerous thing about boca raton are the elderly drivers blinded by old age . 
  sounds like chipotle , qdoba , or moe 's . 
  not even the whitest gringo calls them mexican any more , tex-mex maybe , and chipotle is now in london as well , it seems . 
  american mexican food is notoriously inauthentic , especially on the east coast . 
  i wonder how british mexican compares . 
  i would have assumed that , given the colonial history , spain would have a filipino community .
