so you have separatists opposing separatists & victims defending their attackers . 
  what a time to be alive . 
  lol, 
  * mexican flag * hovers mouse over flair * california * mother fucker ... lol, 
  san francisco is a major port right across from china/japan , home to shit like wells fargo & a federal reserve district hq * ( one of it 's streets has been called the wall street of the west ) * , and it 's a stone 's throw away from silicon valley . 
  i do n't know about dc , but i think a lot of businesses moved there after the recession . 
  do n't quote me on this , but iirc a article i read a couple years ago said it 's related to the bailouts & stimulus that were going full-steam back then , but yeah , that one kinda surprises me too . 
  orlando was swamp until disney came along . 
  mexico is now deporting more people than we do . 
  lol, 
  no , he was polling strong by the end of it iirc . 
  i do n't think his wife could still look him in the eye though ... which means there 's probably a pretty big metaphor in there with a hard truth somewhere ... but i was so annoyed by the execution i was kinda just like ... meh ... 
  well , it 's only part of the equation , and not applicable to everybody . 
  for example , naked femen protesters do n't got shit on the lbj dick-trick . 
  i mean , i ai n't never see them pass a civil rights bill , or implement a nation-wide war on poverty , or invade vietnam , have you ? 
  well , that 's not true . 
  middle-aged women & teenage girls do . 
  but it 's not exactly like the interests of british middle-aged women & teenage girls are the focal point of our attention either . 
  lol, 
  lbj was a brutal politician . 
  he used to helicopter his dick in front of people he was arguing with in the bathroom while yelling * `` have you ever seen one as big as this !?!? 
  '' * to fuck with them & even when he was negotiating outside the bathroom it looked something like [ this ] ( http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/issue/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/thejohnsontreatment.jpg ) . 
  i would almost hold it against him if that type-of-shit did n't actually work & allow him to get a fuckton of shit though congress . 
  that man could work a legislature like a tijuana callgirl . 
  lol, 
  i would too if we were in a vacuum . 
  but i would n't if it set a precedent for terrorists & others to manipulate my entire nation under it 's direction & get our most powerful officials to bend to their will . 
  * that * would end up killing & hurting more people in the long-run . 
  eh , i thought that episode was pretty weak to be honest . 
  i mean , through-out the whole thing i could n't help but think : * `` we do n't negotiate with terrorists because of the precedent '' * quickly followed by * `` especially when it involves me literally fucking a pig on live television '' * . 
  i mean ... it was just too unbelievable ... i mean the internet comments yeah . . it 's the internet ... but actual public opinion , the media & government officials * themselves * calling for it ? 
  even with the suspension of belief . 
  you 're right next to israel , israel exists because of you guys & you guys provided israel with nuclear weapons . 
  but do n't worry , we 'll contend with them at the same time we 're driving nuclear negotiations with iran & bribing the saudi arabians to not develop their own weapons or declare war on iran over those aforementioned nuclear negotiations . 
  oh , and once you get done with israel , you can take fuckin ' pakistan off our hands too bud . 
  lol plus , if you wan na go outside of your comfort zone a little on-top of it , you can move onto asia and be forced to constantly reassure japan & south korea that they do n't need nuclear weapons because you got their back ... even though china & north korea both have nuclear weapons ... 
  so ... you know ... have fun with all that shit & not looking like a hypocrite lol, 
  i do n't know , you should ask the french about that , not us . 
   they & the israelis were a little pissed at us after suez canal . 
  but seriously , what 's the point of your comment ? 
  are you implying that nuclear proliferation & more nukes is a good thing , especially in a region like the middle east ? 
  mocking us for trying to , peacefully , prevent more countries from acquiring nuclear weapons ? 
  because if you are you 're a idiot & you should feel really bad about that . 
  lol, 
  the eu does n't have the balls to send troops to the middle east . 
  it does n't even have the balls to send troops to the eastern part of it 's own territory . 
  lol, 
  * opposition + / = isis * * kurds + / = pkk * * sunnis + / = terrorists * no , really , you 're right though . 
  if there 's one thing we should be doing , it 's ignoring moderate & cooperative sunni & opposition groups completely while allowing extremist shiite militias to run rampant . 
  if there 's one thing that we learned from assad & maliki , * it 's that * , especially so in the context of shit like the dissolution of the awakening councils & the arab spring . 
  we need dictators . 
  more & more dictators . 
  because as we 've seen with saddam , assad , the shah , gaddafi & mubarack * ( you notice how ... when it comes to this shit ... it does n't matter if we support them , oppose them , ignore them or overthrow them ... this shit always tends to follow them ) * , those are * really * the only type of people that can be relied upon to secure long-term stability ... until they 're over-thrown & everybody they 've oppressed , massacred or committed genocide against starts loosing their shit immediately at the moment they show any sign of weakness & tearing shit apart at the seams ... 
  but anyway , we 'll go play big boy with russia & make the hard decisions from a tough position , and you can shut the fuck up and just deal with it . 
  you know , juggling a entire region that 's been fucked since sykes-picot is n't as easy as you think it is . 
  just be glad we managed to get chemical weapons out of assad 's hands on-top of it & ward off french/saudi pleas to bomb his ass , or you know , we 've actually had the balls to bomb isis & raid them with special forces , convince numerous arab countries to commit to a campaign against them , continue to help prop up iraq against them without bombing assad , work with iran in iraq against them , champion a nuclear deal with iran at the same time to try & prevent nuclear proliferation in the region , basically bribe the saudis & israelis to accept that & not start a war over it while the former keeps the oil flowing so all of us can afford to live , while also opening up dialogue with russia here ... oh yeah & dealing with turkey 's shit the whole time while we 're at it ... . because we all know the eu could n't do it , let alone get it 's left foot in front of it 's right . 
  yet , excuse my manners , please continue to do nothing but bitch & complain . 
  it 's very useful when the only potential solution against isis that the majority of the eu has offered is basically as effective as a non-violent protest march on raqqa . 
  now go pay another ransom & fund some more isis human traffickers . 
  well , i might 've not heard much about bosnia over the last fifteen years ... but * i have heard * less about all-out warfare & genocide in the balkans as well ... which directly coincided with the u.s. throwing it 's weight behind that nato mission ... 
  yeah ... the constant warfare & genocide ended itself ... just burnt out & such ... the united states actually committing itself fully to a nato mission there & that directly coinciding with the peace process has nothing to do with it ... purely coincidental & such ... nothing to see here ... move along & keep calm ... 
  japan and the balkans stop being so ... balkany ... after the united states actually committed full-heartily to a nato intervention . 
  two of the most influential republicans , ted cruz & marc rubio , are both latinos who parents were immigrants , represent two of the most immigrant-laden states , texas & florida respectfully , while also being the two who are committed to upholding harsh immigration laws * ( marc rubio tried to get out of his comfort zone a little , but was reprimanded by the party & base pretty harshly , so he fell back in line ) * . 
  puerto rico , a spanish-speaking territory of 4 million that 's pretty impoverished , has verbal support of both parties to become a state , with numerous presidential administrations , from both sides of the aisle , calling for it too happens . 
  mexico now deports more migrants than we import . 
  everything is ass backwards here . 
  lol, 
  which took advantage of sykes-pikot , which was created by the british & french empires , which is the reason canada exists . 
  you forgot to include the world 's 12th largest naval force , the coast guard . 
  when the hell has the eu been more benevolent than the us ? 
  it 's fucked with africa just as much as we 've fucked with latin america & has supported numerous middle eastern dictators , from genocidal saddam to mass-murdering gaddafi , with ya 'll being the one who forced the latter 's overthrow . 
  funny you mention bankruptcy , because we actually have more lenient & forgiving bankruptcy laws than most of europe , spain especially . 
  lol it 's much easier to walk away from debt in america than it is in europe , and it 's been said that 's one of the more important reasons as to why we were able to bounce back much quicker & stronger from the great recession than the eu could with it 's double-dip recession . 
   u.s. companies have flooded eurozone bond markets with a record amount of new debt deals this year , a trend that bankers and investors say is likely to continue at a fast pace for the rest of 2015 . 
   ------------------------------------------------  but nonfinancial corporations have also got in on the act this year because of the low borrowing rates in the euro area . 
  in total , these u.s. companies have raised nearly $ 54 billion in eurozone bond markets this year as of monday , according to data provider dealogic . 
  that already is a new yearly record and 40 % more than they managed over the whole of 2014 . 
   ----------------------------------------------------  u.s. companies have accounted for more than 22 % of all euro-denominated corporate bond issuance in 2015 , more than french and italian companies combined , and outpacing the 12 % of the market the u.s. accounted for last year , according to dealogic . 
  they also make the u.s. the largest issuer in eurozone corporate bond markets by country . 
  last year , the u.s. came in at a distant third , with french companies issuing almost double the amount of bonds as u.s. companies . 
   ---------------------------------------  many u.s. firms have been lured by cheap financing rates that have resulted from the european central bank 's easy-money policies . 
   ---------------------------------------------------  the ecb last week [ reaffirmed its commitment to loosening its money supply ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged-as-investors-eye-staff-forecasts-1441280953 ) to boost sagging eurozone inflation . 
  the central bank [ cut interest rates to record lows ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-cuts-interest-rates-in-surprise-move-1409832304 ) last year and [ started buying government bonds in march ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-central-bank-bets-big-on-stimulus-1425947453 ) , an approach known as quantitative easing , or qe . 
   the prospect of the u.s. federal reserve [ raising interest rates ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-adds-173-000-jobs-in-august-1441370212 ) has also prompted a debt deluge from u.s. companies eager to lock in cheap dollar funding ahead of time . 
  dollar debt issuance is on track for a record year with $ 575 billion so far , according to dealogic . 
  this flood of debt has increased the cost of raising new money in dollars , prompting u.s. firms to look elsewhere . 
   --------------------------------------------------  some analysts warn that the wave of new debt deals in the eurozone could weigh on investors ' appetite . 
   many analysts predicted the ecb 's qe program would further boost corporate bond prices in the secondary market when it started in march , as investors sold low-yielding government bonds and bought higher-yielding corporate bonds , but the flood of bond supply has meant the opposite happened . 
  our access to healthcare is on the same level as western europe & we have a number of worker rights , especially in relation to blue states like california & new england , and while it 's definitely lacking in a number of states in comparison , you 'd have to be a idiot to think we 're on some third-world or developing country-type shit . 
  we could use some federal mandates on vacation too ... but do n't act like the vast , vast majority of jobs do n't provide it ... 
  i mean ... what are you ... willfully ignorant or just stupid ? 
  lol how the fuck are you going to take enough time out of your day to learn english , but not to educate yourself on this & develop a understanding of the situation at hand ? 
  well , actually , we only have a population * 318.9 million * . 
  compared to the eurozone 's population of * 338.3 million * . 
  while i do agree with your general sentiment , i have heard a number of people on here , especially irish & dutch people , defend their countries ' tax haven bullshit , even though it sucks away desperately needed tax revenue from my government & others . 
  so ... forgive me ... but i have a * little bit * of schadenfreude here . 
  not that surprising . 
  our manufacturing costs are becoming [ competitive with china ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/despite-a-strong-dollar-the-us-retains-a-big-manufacturing-cost-advantage-over-europe-japan-and-other-developed-countries-2015-07-23 ) , we 're the [ one global brightspot ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/business/economy/us-economy-q2-gdp-first-revision.html?_r=0 ) in a world defined by stagnant or recessive growth and , pound-for-pound , when it comes to truly integrated national marketplaces , we 're the world 's largest consumer market , underpinned by the world 's largest financial & commodity markets . 
  a [ record number of manufacturing jobs ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-flips-the-script-on-jobs-reshoring-finally-outpaced-offshoring-in-2014-2015-05-01 ) have either been returning home or coming here for the first time like with this factory , with the rate of jobs being reshored having finally outpaced offshoring jobs . 
  to give some perspective ; 60,000 manufacturing jobs were added in the u.s. in 2014 compared to 12,000 in 2003 .
