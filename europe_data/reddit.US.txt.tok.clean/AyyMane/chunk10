  bah , the royal navy still ruled the seas . 
  and while that might 've changed eventually in the context of a relatively united europe , the royal navy remaining a formidable force capable of defending britain is something i ca n't see changing for a long time . 
  in addition , the continental system did n't work the first time & i ca n't see it working a second time . 
  plus , as a island , britain is just really , really god damn hard to invade in general . 
  and as i said before , i think , as more & more debt piled up , as the war of 1812 continued to heat up , that britain would move to protect it 's colonies as opposed to going for one last , * all or nothing * , gamble in the power games of europe . 
  diplomacy & the politics of economics would 've had the day when it came to mainland britain in relation to this , not really warfare in my opinion . 
  although colonial matters & competition are another matter i admit . 
  so , in the context of the above , i just do n't see how what the general british public thought would 've really mattered . 
  the upper-class & posh would 've had terms with napoleon , and the rest would 've followed . 
  we 're talking about early 19th century britain here , a strict class society , where the army was maintained by the whip and the officers made commission by purchase . 
   and if napoleon himself is to be believed , when he came back to power during the 100 days , he did n't want to go on a conquering spree again , and just wanted his dynasty to survive as leader of france . 
  well , to be fair , the large majority of napoleon 's territorial acquisitions & client states * ( with the exception of the spain & russia ) * were n't acquired through offensive wars meant to * conquer them * , but rather carved out from the losers in defensive wars meant to * conquer him * . 
  of course , the way those defeats were determined & losses dictated were because of napoleon 's ambition & search for glory , it 's not like he purposefully set out to establish or take any of it . 
  i mean , he adapted to the situations and took advantage of them to the full extent of his capabilities , but he did n't create those situations . 
  and i was n't trying to imply napoleon would go on to * `` rule europe '' * , but rather dictate it 's politics indirectly by hegemony of influence , and even if that is doubtful * ( which i admit , it is ) * , i still think france , if napoleon empire & institutional foundations survived at their full extent , would 've had a much more positive effect on europe than otherwise . 
   i just would n't want to live in a nation dominated by another . 
  ---------------------------------------------------------  i 'm sorry that your plans to annex british territory in canada did n't work out . 
  irony much in the context of colonies ? 
  lol but seriously , i was n't really being that serious with that and was more just kidding around really . 
  and you do n't , perhaps , even a little , see how a meritocratic europe , united together in peace & stability , inspired by the ideals of the french revolution , might 've been ... perhaps even a little ... * a good thing * ... as opposed to rampant nationalism , power vacuums & a strict social order with little upper mobility ? 
  and i mean , for all the faults of the british empire , * pax britanica * , with the peace & stability it 's hegemony of the seas brought , is n't really ... one of the most pressing ones in context ... 
   this is napoleon we 're talking about . 
  yes , napoleon . 
  it was n't napoleon who was the warmonger , but napoleon who had to * deal with * warmongers . 
  constantly . 
  the third coalition war was ** started by britain ** , who paid both austria & russia to go to war with france . 
  afterwards , for all intents & purposes , napoleon comes across as legitimately wanting peace . 
  the fourth coalition war ** started by prussia ** , with the backing of british money , because they feared the rise of french power after the defeat of austria . 
  one could say that the medization of western europe & unification of germany into the confederation of the rhine as a result of the previous war was a * `` aggressive move '' * that prompted prussia , but only if you ignore the context of basically all of europe declaring war on france for money & using those very things to fuel it . 
  the fifth coalition war ** started by austria ** , once again with the backing of british money , in a attempt to break the franco-russian alliance which was forged in the aftermath of the last war . 
  the sixth coalition war ** started by most of europe ** who , after france 's defeat in russia , jumped at the opportunity to take advantage of the situation & finally oust napoleon . 
  the seventh coalition war ** started by most of europe ** who , after napoleon 's return from exile , immediately sent armies to invade france to put him down for good . 
  the only two wars napoleon really started himself was the russian campaign & the peninsular war , and with the former , the fact that russia had consistently declared war on france & mobilized against it had to be taken into context * ( although it was still a offensive war started by napoleon ) * . 
  and you also have to take into account all of europe basically moving to pick apart and invade france willy-nilly during the revolution * ( although , in context , there was a fuckton of talk about spreading the revolution by force ) * before napoleon even came to power . 
  and let 's also remember , it was napoleon who brought order to the chaos of the revolution and stopped the notion of a fiery crusade to * `` spread the revolution '' * across europe . 
  so as far as napoleon goes , the man who brought order to chaos , most of his territorial gains , most of the states he established , were done in the context of defensive conflicts . 
  fueled by ambition & a search for glory , yes , but still in the context of defensive conflicts and everybody declaring war on him . 
  and * maybe * his death might 've triggered some conflict , but i still believe any conflicts or war that might 've followed in his wake & legacy would 've been * far less * destructive in the context of a divided & politically fragmented europe . 
  an just how many wars do you think the british could 've funded ? 
  how many more times do you think europe could go back to war just to spite one man ? 
  britain was already up to it 's neck in debt by waterloo , and europe as a whole was already exhausted from more than a decade of war . 
  you think britain would risk it 's colonies just to spite napoleon ? 
  especially with america acting up at the time with the war of 1812 * ( kinda defeats my earlier point about canada , but meh , still ) * ? 
  how many more times do you think austria & prussia could mobilize , especially if british money began to slow down to a trickle ? 
  and , also , do n't forget , it did n't matter what the british people wanted , it just mattered what the british upper class wanted . 
  it was n't britain that was fighting for those revolutionary ideals & values of a meritocratic social order , it was britain and everybody else * fighting against it * . 
   i 'm glad that never happened . 
  why ? 
   do you think his empire would have lasted until today ? 
  no , but i think it 's political , cultural & social legacy would 've of been much stronger today , which in my opinion would 've been a good thing . 
   what ? 
  * battle-hardened , well-trained british soldiers * = * burnt white house , no canada * * ^ p.s. 
  ^ above ^ bit ^ is ^ rather ^ light-hearted ^ & ^ not ^ meant ^ to ^ be ^ taken ^ that ^ seriously *, 
  in the context of the british-encouraged political fragmentation & bismarkian-styled division ? 
  excuse me if this sounds far-fetched , but i 've always been of the notion that political unification & strong hegemony , as opposed to political balkanization & strong competition , had the greater effect on stopping wars from erupting & encouraging stability . 
  although , to be quite honest , i ca n't help but find it hilarious that this type of argument is coming from a dude who 's country took pride in establishing * `` pax britannica '' * on the same principles i 'm espousing now . 
  perhaps . 
  but it was napoleon . 
  if he could 've isolated & beat both the british & prussians , separately , at waterloo * ( which he almost did mind you ) * , who 's to say he could n't do the same to the russians & austrians , especially if given a little more breathing room * ( shit , he only needed 100 days to get to the point of waterloo from basically nothing ) * , or at the very least , negotiated a truce with them * ( which also would n't be without precedent ) * . 
  although , i will still say that you 're probably right , and that the best thing napoleon could 've done in hindsight is to stay as far as away from russia as fucking possible . 
  lol, 
  a united europe under french hegemony , imbued with the ideals of the french revolution & values of napoleon 's meritocratic social order * ( in a relative sense to the time ) * . 
  i mean , a lot of those ideals & values took hold regardless , especially in the context of the napoleonic code ... but just imagine if napoleon 's empire , in it 's institutional form , with all it 's foundations intact , had survived ? 
  imagine a europe united & led by * that * ? 
  * skeet , skeet , skeet son * plus , you know , not having all those well-trained , battle-hardened british veterans being shipped across the atlantic to us afterwards would be pretty cool ... so would having canada ... ... but meh ... i digress ... 
  :( * vive l'empereur * oh , how it feels to fantasize about things going differently that day . 
  what 's wrong with belarus & kazakhstan ? 
  lukashenko & nursultan are pioneers when it comes to new structures of power retention & new means of wealth collection . 
  so while you might say kleptocratic dictator , i say innovative trailblazer . 
   the sea belongs to us . 
  * lol *, 
  assange ? 
  of all people ? 
  what are you trying to tell me here ? 
  that the guy who posted a edited video of two journalists with big-ass cameras , in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods of baghdad , surrounded by actual armed militants with rpgs & assault riles * who just ambushed a american convoy * , being killed when the militants they were surrounded with were attacked by a american gunship way up in the sky , and then painting it as the deliberate murder of non-combatants to silence them * ( oh , and also ignoring the unit , which was the same one ambushed earlier , that came under extensive fire from surrounding buildings when they arrived at the scene minutes later ) * , might be a sensationalist attention whore who thrives on misinformation and edginess ? 
  * nooo ... * assange is a man of unbiased , journalistic integrity . 
  he simply wants to express certain parts of the truth in the manner he determines they should be expressed . 
  well , we did it for the british at their urging , who , with the soviets , are the ones who invaded iran & installed the shah in the first place a decade before . 
  and , that 's kinda what i 'm saying actually . 
  a authoritarian dictator in those type of situations results in the opposition turning to religion as a outlet for social & political opposition as there is no real viable alternative . 
  ** so , what 's your point ? 
  ** because you * literally * just agreed with me . 
  an i mean , i 'm really not trying to have a dickwaving contest over here , especially over a event that happened more than half-a-century ago , only a decade after the nazis , around the same time stalin was still in office , eastern europe was under a iron boot , in the same period when the dutch were still fighting in indonesia , the french were in vietnam & getting ready to go into algeria , and when a number of other european colonial empires still existed in a very real sense * ( portuguese in southern africa , the belgians in the congo & rwanda ) * ... 
  it was a shitty time and a shitty period and my country did horrible , unforgivable shit we still have to atone for . 
  i 'm not going to sit here and pretend that all countries do n't practice realpolitik . 
  but i am going to say there 's a difference between doing it competently , with conviction & commitment , and incompetently , with indecisiveness & lack of leadership . 
  one is good for the long-term , the other for the short-term . 
  america has forged strong alliances around the world , we 've delineated clear lines in the sand that other countries know to adhere too & when we make a commitment to you it 's a clear commitment , it 's direction predictable to both the country we 've aligned with & it 's competitors . 
  * that 's the difference . 
  * it would n't work if we tried to appease everybody & give light commitments to everything to appear more flexible . 
  on the downside , we 've made a lot of enemies & justified critics , but we also have a lot of strong allies which trust our word & can rely on us , and our competitors know which boundaries they can & can not cross , or at least , our reaction is well understood . 
  in addition , i 'm not saying any of this is absolute or divine , but that the exceptions do end up proving the rule . 
  i 'm not trying to take things off-topic with the european union , but rather trying to demonstrate how , when it comes to german foreign policy , it 's not just about us-russia , because in my opinion , there 's a very real presence of institutional indecisiveness & lack of leadership . 
  and once again , i do sympathize with the plight of large countries expected to be regional , or global , leaders , and maybe i am blinded by black-and-white cold war politics , i admit that , but watching these thing play out , i ca n't help but feel like , at the end of the day , whether your russia , or the united states , you 're not going to be able to trust germany , much less have confidence in it 's politicians , * no matter what * with the way things are going . 
  and that type of wildcard shit is n't really helpful to anyone in the long-run , much less germany in itself , as it lacks a direction you can predict , and boundaries you know to adhere to . 
  it makes everything foggy & unpredictable , which just makes things more unstable , especially in consideration of the higher likelihood of mistaken intentions on why countries are doing certain things & wrong estimations on how countries will react to certain things ... 
  this is n't realpolitik , it 's the exact opposite , as your goverment is literally going against it 's own interests in the long-term . 
  and trying to avoid fallout from * anything * is the crux of the whole problem , because it causes you to get fallout from * everything * . 
  i do n't think the german government are anti-american crusaders for the most part , i just think the german government is completely incompetent when it comes to foreign policy . 
  ** example # 1 : ** germany builds nordstream , refuses to back a bolstered nato presence in eastern europe & flirts with russia about them joining the eu , * `` omg the americans do n't trust us anymore & might be spying on us !?!?!,
