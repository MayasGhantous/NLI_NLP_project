  wtf !?!? 
  '' * , and than germany opens dialogue with ukraine & flirts with them about eu membership despite it being in direct opposition to one of the strongest pillars of russia 's overall geopolitical strategy , * `` omg the russians do n't like us anymore and are invading ukraine !?!? 
  wtf !?!? '' * . 
  ** example # 2 : ** germany tells britain there 's no more negotiation on integration in regards to finance & free movement , it 's a zero-sum game , * `` omg !!, 
  the british do n't trust us anymore & are talking about a brexit !?!?!, 
  wtf !!!, 
  '' * , and then goes and tells southern europe there 's no more negotiation when it comes to increased integration in the form of fiscal policy/transfers and help with outside migration , * `` omg !!!, 
  southern europe does n't trust us anymore & are talking about a grexit !?!?!, 
  wtf !?!? '' * . 
  and this attitude is n't just like ... electoral differences ... from what i can see it 's like ... a very real , and underlying policy of germany 's political establishment on foreign issues . 
  it 's like ... watching a indecisive bipolar guy trying to both have his cake & eat it too ... while sharing it with everybody ... which at the end of the day just ends up with everybody not trusting him and being pissed . 
  so , you see , by trying to appease everybody , germany is literally opposing everybody , which might work great in the short-term , but it goes against it 's interests in the long-term because germany is n't actually making * serious * commitments and forging * strong * alliances with anybody . 
  it 's just ... making everybody really distrustful & annoyed . 
  and this might not be * so bad * for a smaller country , but germany is n't a small country , it 's one of , if not * the * primary cornerstone of the eu & it 's expected to be a leader in regional politics . 
  that requires hard decisions & large commitments , two things germany seems reluctant to make or hold too . 
  an do n't get me wrong , i do sympathize . 
  large countries come with large responsibilities . 
  you 're going to have a lot of people pissed at you guys * no matter what you do * , but * you need to do something & stick to it * . 
  indecisiveness , fair-weather convictions & a lack of leadership when it comes to great powers & super powers just ... does n't work ... . 
  the german public is [ opposed to defending fellow nato member-states ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20150610/germans-against-helping-nato-militarily ) , the german government has [ routinely opposed bolstering a nato presence in eastern europe * ( specifically the baltics & poland ) * ] ( http://en.delfi.lt/lithuania/defence/germany-does-not-approve-of-natos-military-expansion-to-poland-and-baltic-states.d?id=65445596 ) and [ the ex-german chancellor is chairing the construction of gazprom pipelines * ( immediately after leaving office & approving said project on his way out ) * ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/09/ar2005120901755.html ) which will not only increase europe 's dependence on russia , but also [ isolate a number of eastern european states from the rest of europe * ( allowing russia to cut-off gas to them or gauge prices for them without effecting the rest of europe ) * while posing a serious risk to swedish security . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream#controversy ) i do n't even have * the slightest idea * why people would suspect we might have spied on the german government before . 
  the middle east has n't been calm since sykes-pikot . 
  you ca n't blame us for everything that 's going down right now in the region and act like shitty european map-making skills and the legacy of colonialism has n't played a huge god damn part in it as well * ( especially so in the context of authoritarian dictators trying to fill power vacuums ) * . 
  an the thing about middle eastern dictatorships is that they always lead to the opposition becoming radicalized , as their only political/social alternative is religious expression . 
  people blame us for iran 's religious extremists because we supported a authoritarian dictator . 
  they blame us for egypt 's religious extremists because we supported a authoritarian dictator . 
  but when we help or consent to the overthrow of a authoritarian dictator , we 're also blamed for the religious extremists that pop up in their wake * ( which was actually hilarious in the context of egypt , because we simultaneously got blamed for causing religious extremists by both supporting mubarak and initially opposing sisi in support of the democratic egyptian government ) * ? 
  so is n't it weird that , no matter what , whether it 's a dictator we support , or we oppose , or we ignore , they always end up having bloody civil wars & insurgencies defined by religious extremists ? 
  are you so blind that you ca n't see that the one constant factor associated with authoritarian dictators in the region is religious extremists , regardless of america ? 
  oh , and by the way , we were so thirsty for that iraqi oil that european & chinese corporations ended up getting the vast majority of contracts for it . 
   * p.s. 
  and just to clarify , i know iraq was started over some bullshit , and i believe the occupation was incompetently handled until about 06-07 with the surge & sunni awakening , but i also stand by the fact that the type of religious extremists you see now , not only in iraq , but through-out the region , were inevitable in the context of authoritarian regimes which criminalize any contradictory social or political opposition outside of religion , regardless of america 's role in the situation . 
  and please , forgive me in general if i do n't have much sympathy or fucks to give for authoritarian dictators who put down protests with mass murder and routinely invade their neighbors . 
   it 's al america 's fault yeah you can screw off with that . 
  lol the british & the french led the charge on that and pushed us into it , after we were reluctant to get involved in the first place , and even after our hand was forced , we rushed to hand it back over to the europeans when things were back under control , who afterwards scoffed at the very idea of occupying libya or anything of the like , and you know , actually even * trying * to stabilize the situation after they championed gaddafi 's overthrow . 
  not to mention your own country took part . 
  and i 'm not trying to say we have no blame , because we do , we helped significantly at first , but we did n't push for it , and it was you guys who bit off more than you could chew forcing us to act . 
  we were n't about to let our allies be shown up by a 3rd world authoritarian dictator , especially when they 're operating under a unsc banner . 
  and it 's not america , but your fellow eu countries with their shit military spending that 's one of the largest reasons for you being flooded . 
  you think shit would be half-as-bad if germany , the netherlands and numerous other european countries actually had a navy worth half-a-damn and were committed to actually helping italy ? 
  and now , what the fuck are the same countries which pushed everybody into libya doing ? 
  the same countries which championed european free-movement , integration & solidarity ? 
  they 're turning on you , cracking down on their borders & refusing to give italy more naval assets to help with the crisis . 
  we 're not in the eu , we did n't lead the charge for libya , yet we catch * all * the god damn blame somehow . 
  ** edit : i 'm being downvoted pretty heavily , but can anyone actually reply & tell me where i 'm wrong , or better yet , give evidence contradicting me ? 
  ** [ ** france and britain lead military push on libya ** ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/world/africa/19europe.html )  * paris * -- france and britain continued to press their hawkish position on libya on friday , saying they intend to take the lead in enforcing a no-flight zone . 
   both countries , the most adamant backers of the united nations security council resolution to authorize military action in libya , also pointed to the passage of the measure on thursday as an important -- if rare -- example of european resolve . 
  [ ** libya : can britain and france really run this conflict ? 
  * america does n't even want to be in libya , and the germans are just getting in the way , writes con coughlin * . 
  ** ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/concoughlin/8399184/libya-can-britain-and-france-really-run-this-conflict.html )  we 've only been at war for four days , but already serious divisions have appeared within the coalition leadership over how to prosecute the campaign . 
  it is easy to understand barack obama 's reluctance to play a lead role in a conflict he did n't want in the first place . 
  this was one war that america did n't want . 
   britain and france may have made all the running in drumming up international support for a no-fly zone . 
  so if london and paris are so keen to confront gaddafi , why do n't they run the campaign ? 
  after all , it was only at the end of last year that the british and french governments signed a new defence cooperation pact , whereby they agreed to cooperate more closely on military issues . 
  the french even agreed to allow us the use of one of their aircraft carriers -- assuming , that is , we had the aircraft to fly off it . 
   ----------------------------------------------------------  but unlike recent coalition campaigns in kosovo , iraq and afghanistan , libya is different . 
  this time , mr obama and his generals ca n't wait for the opportunity to hand over responsibility for the mission to someone else . 
  as one senior us officer told me yesterday : * `` the europeans wanted the no-fly zone ; so the europeans can command the no-fly zone . 
  '' *  the only problem with this neat solution is that , as is so often the case when dealing with a major security issue , * `` the europeans '' * just ca n't agree on how the command structure should be run . 
  and do i really need to give sources for italy 's fellow eu member-states cracking down on their borders with it & failing to commit serious naval assets * ( whether because they 're unwilling or simply incapable ) * to help with the protection of it 's sea borders ? 
  bah , just shut up canada & follow our lead like you did during the crisis . 
  lol we 'll even let you pretend you did it & truly broke alliegence to the british empire because of * `` peacekeeping '' * , which you can then build a overinflated legacy around . 
  we overestimated the missile gap , yes , but it 's not as if they did n't have * any * missiles with nuclear warheads either . 
  and we had no way of knowing any of what historians say now in hindsight , and because of that i 'm glad we did n't call that bluff for the sake of some dying empires . 
  in addition , it 's also generally accepted , both then & now , that the soviets had the conventional edge around this time in regards to the european theatre . 
  probably one of the reasons they felt they could get away with the berlin siege that forced the airlift . 
  so even if they did n't go nuclear , them going conventional would n't have been very pretty either . 
  it was chancing all of europe & countless american lives for some dipshit colonies & foreign imperialism that nobody felt the need to inform us about even though we 'd be doing a huge amount of the fighting in the world war it could 've ignited . 
  after moving in completely opposite directions on the issue as well interestingly enough . 
  i 'm 21 ? 
  lol, 
   note that the article says officials denied israel prepping nuclear weapons was the reason for the resupply . 
  it is slightly amusing though that kissinger 's response to desperate israeli begging went from * `` calm down , you 'll be fine with a modest increase to our present support '' * to * `` fuck it , here 's the keys to half the american armory , have fun '' * practically overnight . 
  entirely coincidental however . 
  lol, 
  yeah , but let 's be fair , damn near every country spies on damn near every country . 
  israel spied on us & we spied on israel , germany spied on us & we spied on germany while we were helping each other spy on everybody else , france has committed industrial espionage against germany while probably helping , or at the very least sharing , with germany industrial espionage against us . 
  everybody & their mother spies on the european union including the european union , and it 's pretty much a given that it 's the same with nato . 
  the only countries that likely , but ar n't guaranteed , to not spy on each other are five eyes * ( u.s. , canada , u.k. , australia & new zealand ) * . 
  it 's why the first thing merkel did when us bugging her phone went public was to try & use it to leverage germany into five eyes . 
  yeah , personally i think both them & yugoslavia are the two nations that managed to birth something that was closest to communism as it was envisioned * ( even if neither actually achieved it for their own respective reasons ) * . 
  the impressive thing about israel though is they managed to get so far into it without the authoritarian dictator or gun to the back forcing them to participate . 
  lol although , the fact that tito had to use such force to achieve what yugoslavia did , israel never committed to going all the way & that most of the kibbutz eventually , and very willingly , decided to turn themselves into some type of capitalist enterprise has only reinforced my * personal opinion * that communism is incompatible with human nature overall & in general . 
  israel was basically run by communist-lite for most of it 's history in a much more radical way than pretty much all of western europe when it comes to socialism * ( an not ussr-type socialism either , but like huge self-sufficient equal-slice co-op commune type socialism ) * , and to this day is just as socialist as any european country & more so than most iirc . 
  so ... you know ... there goes that argument ... also , sweden & germany are like ... literally ... two of the biggest arms dealers in the world ... 
  both were trying to re-start their colonial empires through it & the soviets were threatening a nuclear war in europe because of it . 
  what part of that sounds like a good idea to you ? 
  lol the resurrecting of empires which willingly & knowingly caused untold misery for countless millions around the world in the most unfair way possible or the starting a world war that would kill countless millions right off the bat in your own backyard for the * third time * ? 
  and it would 've been very hard to ignore us when not only was our threat to wreck france , britain & israel economically very credible given the uneven dependence relationship of the 3 & us , but also because all three were presently applying for assistance from the imf , which the united states basically controlled at the time given the level of our contributions to it . 
  all of this , too , in the context of france & britain having * just * ate up a huge chunk of the aid we provided then through the marshall plan & the troops we had garrisoning the fulda gap in preparation to defend them . 
  are you implying only catholic ones ever did ? 
  one by a respected professor & senior research fellow who specializes in israel 's nuclear history & strategic policy and get 's published by the nyt ... 
  if that 's not good enough for you , than just use google yourself & pick one of the fifty articles that pop up from there , because i do n't got time to go fishing for you all day . 
  lol, 
  sure . 
   [ ** the last nuclear moment ( * the new york times * ) ** ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/06/opinion/the-last-nuclear-moment.html )  later that morning , at the end of a somber briefing before the war cabinet , mr. dayan raised the nuclear option with the prime minister . 
  no detailed record has surfaced as to what exactly mr. dayan proposed , but we know he gave an overall assessment that israel was fast approaching the point of '' * last resort * '' . 
  and certainly ** mr. dayan wanted the united states to take notice that things had reached such a point . 
  ** that he meant using nuclear weapons ( * albeit in coded language , as at the time nobody dared call them by name * ) was confirmed in an interview last week by naftali lavie , who was mr. dayan 's spokesman during the war .
