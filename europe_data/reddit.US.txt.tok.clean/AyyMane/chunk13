  quite the opposite actually . 
  we owe it to hegemony . 
  which we only achieved by deconstructing imperialism . 
  if it was n't this way , we 'd be living in a * very * different world right now . 
  lol we 're not a small , poor or weak nation . 
  we 're a big , wealthy & strong one . 
  we did n't need colonialism like european nations did to flex . 
  and if we did adapt it , we sure as fuck would n't be facing a multipolar world today for better or for worse . 
  this is so annoying though . 
  * `` imperialism '' * should n't be used as a catch-all word for any & all influence jockeying in foreign policy . 
  that 's just power politics . 
  it 's * sooo * fucking retarded how edgy neckbeards & college liberal hipsters have basically subverted this shit with emotionally-charged & misleading buzzwords . 
  ** historically , no , they have n't . 
  ** for much of israel 's early history , it was * france * & * britain * that israel relied on , best evidenced by when we slapped both them & israel down during the suez canal crisis , as well as the fact , iirc , both , if not mainly france , were their primary arm suppliers & foreign supporters up until the yum kippur war . 
  america kept a rather measured hand , so as to not push arab nations into the soviet sphere , whom we were still hoping to bait away into ours . 
  it was n't until the 70s when israel threatened * ( or , more accurately , bluffed ) * to nuke * ( with tech france helped them develop , we pressured them to abandon & they lied to us about having ) * egypt & syria by making what seemed to be easily-detectable preparations to do so at the lowest point of the yum kippur war , and after it was clearly established that the arab nations would dig themselves in deeper with the soviets no matter what we did , that we moved to support them in a heavy , exclusive manner . 
  and even then , the massive airlift of military equipment & emergency logistical/tech assistance we gave during the yum kippur war was more of a kinda spur-of-the-moment typa temporary life-raft decision than anything else , intended to potentially prevent nuclear war & the fall of one of the few western-aligned nations in the region . 
  things did n't really solidify into the special relationship we have today until the 80s & after the camp david accords , the latter of which entrenched us even deeper into regional affairs by tying us to egypt as well . 
  also , there 's that whole thing about israel being born from a british colonial mandate & all ... 
  because congress slashed & burned every other way , leaving this obama 's only clearly legal & constitutional way to get it done , unless he attempts something else radical , hence my comments about the supreme court . 
  congress is blocking it despite obama 's like fifth attempt to force them to shut it down , and he 's now trying to say fuck them completely & try to pull it off unilaterally , but if not enough countries agree to take detainees , this whole thing will probably go to the supreme court or something . 
  ** now , do you have a actual source on what you claimed about obama or argument supporting it ? 
  ** why are you distracting from the conversation ? 
  lol you were so fucking smug & self-assured before , but now this . 
   whales this is why we sent obama instead of you bob . 
  there 's a difference between saying he did nothing wrong & calling you out for your bullshit when you 're lying over something very specific . 
  there 's a reason you do n't have a source or real argument for a reply , just a smug one liner . 
  lol go circlejerk somewhere else . 
  * ** the churchill bust was never removed , get your facts right ** * ** he criticized cameron on libya , since we only went into libya , reluctantly i might add , at britain 's request , & cameron could n't uphold his side of the bargain which we got blamed for ... and then he could n't even back us on syria afterwards ** * ** kerry said france was our oldest ally ... which they are ... and obama only called for britain to maintain the defined 2 % nato target for military spending ... after pushing us into libya & basically forcing us to help france in mali because you guys were incapable ** * ** he made that comment after your government invited him over & requested him to back their position on a brexit ... which he is doing here ... as a favor to your government ... as he did for the scotland vote ** i swear , wtf is up with brits & obama on reddit lately . 
  between scapegoating america for every shitty decision your government makes because you ca n't take responsibility for your own actions ( * `` we only did it because we 're their poodle !, 
  swear !, 
  '' * ) , you 're demonizing obama like he 's personally out to get you & eat your children . 
  but what was your implication again ? 
  because it sounded like you 're implying that obama supports & conducts torture like the queen & your prime ministers have supported & conducted pedophilia . 
  that happened under bush , he personally declassified the information around it & called it out for what it was despite everybody on both sides of congress , probably with the exception of mccain , refusing to do so . 
  ** no , he does n't . 
  ** get the fuck out of here with that bullshit man . 
  and it 's over . 
  pivoting to asia to counter a rising china , trying to force europe to take more responsibility for it 's military , normalizing relations with cuba & playing iran off against saudi arabia so they 're too distracted to deal with us & israel , and also forcing saudi arabia even deeper into our corner so it made it pretty much impossible for them to ever pull a repeat of the 1971 oil embargo again . 
  i agree with all those things & think they 'll outweigh the bad . 
  opposing keystone , withdrawal from iraq , even in the context of maliki & fucking up with that * `` red line '' * in regards to syria are some things i disagree with though , even if i understand why he did them .

  let 's be real . 
  lol the publics in those countries are * already * against the idea of including us . 
  that just makes it worse though . 
  because it increases our feelings of isolation while giving us seemly no leverage in return . 
  kinda ironic though . 
  anti-americanism is so prevalent in countries which have been treated the most preferentially & given the most respect by us , the ones descended from the same mother country as us , and thus , are the ones who benefitted the most from american hegemony . 
  meanwhile , some of the most pro-american countries in the world now-a-days are vietnam , japan & the philippines ... all of whom we have either invaded , nuked or colonized brutally ... and all of which are oriental & could n't be father from us culturally ... how the fuck did this happen ? 
  lol anyway , i would argue it goes beyond the poets & such , like kipling & his hopes for a anglo-american union , and into wwii with spoken & unspoken agreements made by churchill & roosevelt . 
  if it looked like the british were trying to go behind our backs & resurrect their empire on the sly , cutting us out politically from the anglosphere ... than yeah ... probably ... 
  but we 'd also probably be open to being included , although domestic opposition in your own countries would likely prevent that from happening , hence a impasse . 
  we 've established ourselves as the hegemon of north america & the anglosphere by invitation of the british . 
  we did n't seize it forcefully . 
  we 've given both groups , especially canada , preferential treatment & more respect than most other countries in the world for more than half-a-century . 
  the american government would view a attempt to steal that away from us & abandon us on top of it as basically being stabbed in the back by a friend the minute they smelled weakness * ( a multipolar world ) * , and would likely react accordingly . 
  the united kingdom ca n't provide the economic benefits to canada that our trade can & ca n't protect the shipping lanes around australia/new zealand like our navy can . 
  so no . 
  lol the british empire & commonwealth as political entities died in the 60s . 
  plus , even if we did n't have such a huge carrot over britain in this regard , we 'd still have a bigger stick . 
  but , yes , it would be unfortunate to see the uk alienate the european union & then alienate us back-to-back like a ping-pong ball outta hell . 
  it 'd literally be foreign policy suicide . 
  although , in context , we would probably be eager to join a pan-anglosphere integration movement . 
   we just would n't allow a concrete one without us . 
  no , the fact we * went into libya * for the british is evidence enough . 
  lol, 
  sure , if you do n't count five eyes , assistance with nuclear weapons , us being britain 's most important military partner in basically all ways , how we 're each other 's largest source of fdi and the diplomatic/political preference/respect we give each in relation to other countries . 
  but than you 'd just be a idiot reading too deep into editorialized headlines from articles with a inherent bias , and who could be that stupid ? 
  lol, 
  hey , hold the hell up , just because we do n't support the british leaving the eu does n't mean we wo n't have their backs if they did . 
  that said , if they try to cut us out of the equation afterwards & integrate the rest of the anglosphere without us , especially in the context of canada , thus basically trying to isolate & fuck us geopolitically in our own back yard , than yeah , we 're not going to tolerate that & they 'll regret not trying to include us . 
  lol, 
  all of you have been willing partners in spying , not only with us & within our framework , but with each other & within your own framework . 
  if the uk is the backdoor for american political influence in the eu , than you 're the gaping asshole for american corporate influence in the eu . 
  most americans do n't understand the implications . 
  but the government does . 
  every country stanks of hypocrisy everywhere . 
  welcome to the real-world . 
  bitchy semantics & passive aggressive edginess is n't going to get these kind of discussions anywhere outside of furious & smug circlejerking . 
  i was n't trying to explain the motivations & reasoning of the british elite , only the american ones . 
  and ... personally ... i actually support a north american union in one sense or another ... so ... 
  no problem . 
   though it also was n't all sunshine & roses . 
  we also launched fucked shit like * operation gladio * which , while it encouraged european integration in a sense , did it in a. . . horrible ... manipulative way ... even in the context of europe 's desperate security situation at the time ... and it might 've eventually spun out of our control & created a monster we could n't tame ... but hey !, 
  still encouraged integration !, 
  i guess ... also , one reason we even managed to achieve so much influence was because we slapped down britain & france during the suez canal crisis by threatening to crash their markets ... which while yes ... it was in the context of them trying to forcibly revive their colonial empires & the soviet union threatening us with nuclear war in europe because of that ... was still pretty bullyish ... ** edit : ** oh , and we also forced west germany to abandon it 's nuclear program , because we did n't like the idea of a country right on the front lines being able to turn a conventional war into a nuclear one without our permission ... the precedent of which infuriated france & made them withdraw from nato 's command structure & begin their own nuclear program so they could basically say * `` fine !, 
  if you do n't choose to go nuclear against the soviets when it comes down to it , we 'll do it for you & force your hand whether you like it or not !, 
  '' * , since , in context , while france 's nuclear arsenal could never compare to the american one , all they needed to do was launch a single french nuke to force us to fire all our nukes ... basically co-opting our nukes in favor of their timing . 
  lol, 
  defense for the second part & half of the first part . 
  even ignoring wwii in itself , we garrisoned the fulda gap for damn near half-a-century & have a significant amount of troops stationed in europe & dedicated to it 's defense to this day . 
  the worse did n't come to pass thank god , but if it did we had a huge number of soldiers ready in both europe & prepared to ship across the atlantic on short notice to meet it . 
  in addition , our military spending in this regard has allowed a number of eu nations to divert spending that might 've originally been earmarked for that to things like social spending & inter-european projects . 
  so basically , to summarize , we 've committed ourselves to providing a security umbrella for both the eu 's predecessor organizations & the eu itself to come together & integrate in a safe & stable environment . 
  in regards to the 1st part , you have the marshall plan , the debt forgiveness we gave germany in the 50s * ( or 60s ... ca n't remember ) * , the foreign aid we 've provided to eastern europe following the cold war , the money we dumped when the euro was introduced to help stabilize it , the backdoor liquidity we provided to european banks during the great recession that we diverted from our own massive stimulus & the fact we 're by far the largest contributor to the imf in relation to it 's contributions to the bail-outs given to european countries . 
  also , diplomatic pressure . 
  going back to the 60s & 70s britain has been reluctant to integrate closer with europe , and countries like france to accept it . 
  we 've bent over backwards , diplomatically speaking , to convince the british it was a good idea & the french that it was n't a bad idea , in addition to the diplomatic encouragement we gave other european countries across the board to integrate .
