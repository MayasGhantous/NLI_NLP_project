  we 're approaching a multipolar world . 
  he 's right in a sense . 
  a unipolar world , under american hegemony in this sense , represents stability & predictability , while a multipolar world represents the opposite . 
  there 's going to be a lot of pushing of the boundaries , challenging of old power structures & newly empowered countries competing for their respective spheres-of-influence . 
  oh , and now throw in global warming , shrinking water resources worldwide & a growing dependence on rare earth materials on-top of that . 
  lol i do find it slightly amusing though . 
  many redditors , especially from the anglosphere & western europe , have been cheering this on as if it will give birth to a era of peace & prosperity for them , not realizing that they have been the ones to benefit most & get the most preferential treatment from american hegemony , or that history books always go to show the opposite of their predictions in regards to these types of events . 
  no , churchill agreed to it originally & made a official proclamation in support of it back in around 1940 during the fall of france . 
  it was n't until around 4 years later , during d-day , when what you referenced was said in a emotionally heated argument between the two . 
  and the way it was phrased , while it might not matter much , was in a way which specifically mentioned de gaul & roosevelt by name , not by nation or title , showing how personal , for better or worse , the relationship had become between all the leaders . 
  you say that like eastern europe does n't exist , especially poland , which given projected growth rates & the foundation it 's working off , is likely to be pretty god damn influential in the future of the eu relative to the influence it has now , and romania as well to a lesser degree for the same reasons . 
  ** united europe ** = a influential western political union the united states can find common ground with more often than not in a increasingly multi-polar world , a strong regional military alliance which should be able to look after it 's own so our military can actually focus more on our pivot to asia & a solid single market which would be more profitable to american corporations . 
  there also might be the whole * `` sunken-cost fallacy '' * motivating us . 
  we 've spent around sixty year pushing for a united europe & prodding the british to go along with it , dumping immense amounts of money into the idea , putting countless lives on the line to achieve it & expending huge amounts of political capital to make it seem tenable , so fuck the idea of all that going down the drain over just a couple years . 
  lol, 
  remember when people said scotland would * definitely * go independent after obama came out against it ? 
  lol, 
  * lol * how 'd that work on hong kong , currency manipulation & academic integrity ? 
  but no , what does all that matter when you can just be an edgy neckbeard ? 
  lol, 
  yeah , remember how scotland voted for independence after obama came out against it ? 
  [ ** wikipedia ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-british_union#world_war_ii_.281940.29 )  reynaud supporter charles de gaulle had arrived in london earlier that day , however , and monnet told him about the proposed union . 
  de gaulle convinced churchill that '' * some dramatic move was essential to give reynaud the support which he needed to keep his government in the war * '' . 
  the frenchman then called reynaud and told him that the british prime minister proposed a union between their countries , an idea which reynaud immediately supported . 
  de gaulle , monnet , vansittart , and pleven quickly agreed to a document proclaiming a joint citizenship , foreign trade , currency , war cabinet , and military command . 
  churchill withdrew the armistice approval , and at 3 p.m. the war cabinet met again to consider the union document . 
  despite the radical nature of the proposal , churchill and the ministers recognized the need for a dramatic act to encourage the french and reinforce reynaud 's support within his cabinet before it met again at 5pm . 
   the final '' * declaration of union * '' approved by the british war cabinet stated that :   france and great britain shall no longer be two nations , but one franco-british union . 
  the constitution of the union will provide for joint organs of defence , foreign , financial and economic policies . 
  every citizen of france will enjoy immediately citizenship of great britain , every british subject will become a citizen of france . 
   churchill and de gaulle called reynaud to tell him about the document , and they arranged for a joint meeting of the two governments in concarneau the next day . 
  well , actually , we pretty much begged you guys to adapt a * actual * form of federalism by giving us representation in parliament & providing us some kind of * guaranteed * autonomy . 
  you told us to fuck off . 
  lol so we fucked you guys out of the united states in turn . 
  he accomplished a lot . 
  it 's hard to say he has n't . 
  the edgy neckbeards with their sarcastic comments are going to be the grumpy old men in denial once the history books get to him . 
  he also threw his support behind a joint franco-british union during wwii . 
  dm ; sg, 
  you say that like it 's any clearer over here . 
  lol, 
  what was so disastrous about their remarks ? 
  all they implied was that european & greek politicians are absolute shit at their jobs who only get shit done when moving from crisis-to-crisis . 
  sounds about right to me . 
  lol, 
  you 're right to a extent . 
  but russia is a member of the western world . . in the same way as south america ... not eu-usa ... but still western . 
  that eurasian union works both ways . 
  you get the benefits * and * the downsides . 
  and let 's be real , our countries have been fucking with each other * heavily * on some geopolitical-type shit for more than a century , we 've got translators for each other for days * ( sorry if that does n't translate well , but basically what i 'm saying is that we 've fucking with each other over serious shit for so long we ca n't afford to not have translators ) * . 
  lol my problem is merely when our countries use * `` neutral , fact-finding '' * organizations to fuck each other in the ass . 
  which we do all the time . 
  but still it fucks everything . 
  and that 's my problem with wikileaks . 
  kinda , but the congress event solidified it . 
  you have a upvote . 
  real shit . 
  honestly , i was really pissed when netanyahu did it , but at the same time , i could n't help but think ... what a american fucking thing to do ... but still ... netanyahu is israeli ... so ... still ... unless israel is down to become the 51st/52nd state or a commonwealth than i got a problem with that kind of interfering ... 
  outside of letting europe push us into europe & not putting more pressure on the iraqi government to let us stay * ( which , to be fair , despite what you say , following bush 's withdrawal was actually dovish , even if i disagree with it ) * ... i do n't really mind any of that ... 
  although , on a serious note , while obama has n't been a dove , he has n't been a warhawk either really , which is a stance i agree with him in general a lot of the time . 
  no , run out the building , but when he tries to fuck me in the ass while trying to get out the fire escape , he 's still a dickhead . 
  i did n't say disregard it , nor did i ever question the source 's authenticity , but when you allow yourself to be used as a weapon by russia to * specifically * go after my country & dismantle the alliances we have around the world , with no balance given at all in the most biased way possible , you can suck a dick . 
  you 're over here talking about * `` this should n't be about teams & taking sides '' * , while justifying wikileaks joining russia 's team & taking sides against us . 
  how is that in my interests ? 
  i 'm not fucking russian . 
  lol why make it so fucking difficult for me to support them , which i really want to do , when at the end-of-the-day , they just want to go after * my country * & * our allies * , without actually giving any actual fucks about the principles they supposedly espouse ? 
  they 're poisoning the well with their political bullshit & geopolitical games , turning me , and the people of my country overall , the most influential in the god damn world , against them . 
  so if you really give two shits about * actual * transparency & neutrality than you would understand why i 'm disgusted by their actions , since it gives the enemies of transparency & neutrality a fuckton of ammunition to use , since the ** actual ** mccarthyists are going to point to shit like russia 's ties with wikileaks to justify their bullshit against others . 
  i disagree , it goes deeper than that . 
  the slap-in-the-face that netanyahu gave to the office of the president when he went behind obama 's back to address congress against the iranian nuclear deal was disgusting . 
  that type of shit would 've never happened before , even when israel basically had communist-lite running the county at the height of the cold war & had a even shittier security situation on their borders . 
  only netanyahu could manage to [ piss off ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/international/sarkozy-obama-netanyahu-liar-israel/story?id=14903750 ) both america & france , two of the most pro-israel countries around . 
   ** sarkozy : ** i ca n't look at him [ * netanyahu * ] anymore , he 's a liar . 
   ** obama : ** you 've had enough of him , but i have to deal with him every day . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  lol i mean . . could you ... * please * ... explain your reasoning when you accuse me of mccarthyism ? 
  or ... is that just the loudest buzzword you could think of to distract from the conversation ? 
  lol i mean ... it 's not even a random accusation ... the most famous spokesman has a show on russia today , their most prominent asset was provided asylum in russia after direct negotiations between the fsb & wikileaks staff ... fuck , around 2010 wikileaks was talking about dropping * `` a bombshell '' * on russia and dumping * `` huge trove of classified documents '' * . 
  you know what happened ? 
  the fsb said * `` we can destroy you '' * , and all of a sudden , six years later , i have n't seen * shit * about their bombshell , but i have seen wikileaks members get tv shows on russian state media , have contact with russian secret services & every american ally/partner be targeted for confidential document dumps , dwarfing any leaks coming out of russia , which was pitiful to begin with . 
  i mean , you can support what they do & support the leaks for the leaks themselves , but do n't bury your fucking head-in-the-sand and ignore shit when it 's staring you straight in the face . 
  are you seriously asking why ideologues of the regressive left are tied in so deep with wikileaks ? 
  next you 'll be wondering why their * `` russia '' * section is lacking , how they were able to coordinate directly with the fsb on the dime for snowden using contacts already in moscow or how assange got a tv show on russia today . 
  wikileaks is useful , but i think they cause more harm than good in the long-run given how tied in they are with the russian state & the fact they do n't give a fuck what they leak , whether it 's legitimate , justified or not , as long as it makes america specifically look like shit without context & no balance given to countries like russia & china . 
  it 's , * literally * , the greatest propaganda platform in recent memory in my opinion . 
  moscow pulled a fucking master stroke when they backed/hijacked them & managed to control the message/medium . 
  bruh , they can maintain a functional * ( if completely shitty ) * state during wartime & field a army when being bombed by some of the most militarily effective air forces in the world . 
  i think they can infiltrate a mind-boggling flood of migrants . 
  i think i might support compensation given * it was * a terrible tragedy & i 'd definitely support formal condolences for their deaths , but not a apology for our actions here . 
  we did n't know they were there & we 're dealing with religious extremists who use terrorist tactics . 
  plus , the united states has * repeatedly * explained it 's take on negotiating with terrorists over ransoms . 
  as in , we do n't do it & we do n't encourage it , because it not only justifies the kidnapping of * ten more * innocent people given the precedent it sets , but it * also * bankrolls terrorist attacks by said groups . 
  and that argument is what leads to populists & partisan bullshit taking hold on all sides . 
  the tea party , corbynites , trump crew & the sanders brigade are evidence of this . 
  by the time people finally realize they 're in more control than they realize , they 've elected the loudest mother fucker in the room just because they wanted to seem contrarian on some hipster bullshit without thinking of the consequences . 
  that or they just did n't vote because * `` it does n't matter '' * . 
  if you 're kidnapped by a terrorist group , i 'm not going to support setting a precedent which will lead to ten other people getting kidnapped & which will help bankroll future terrorist attacks . 
  is that fucked ? 
  absolutely . 
  but it 's also the best solution in my opinion .
