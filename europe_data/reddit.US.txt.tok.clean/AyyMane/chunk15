  you ca n't lose their game if you do n't play their game . 
   i hope the us sends a apology to you guys and a big compensation to the victims families since these people while being in the wrong place at the wrong time could 've been saved . 
  ** how ? 
  ** the serbian government did n't know where they were and we were unaware they were where we were performing airstrikes . 
  are you suggesting we should 've halted the air campaign completely because of the possibility of human shields & waited as another european nation wbankrolled another group of daesh by giving into their ransom demands after negotiations which were n't even certain to end well ? 
  both of those things just lead to * more * kidnappings and groups like this getting stronger through increased funding & dettering overall military action against them . 
  it 's the truth though . 
  the people who say otherwise just want to shift responsibility away from the citizenry * ( and thus , indirectly , themselves ) * . 
  same thing with anglosphere countries who blame every shitty decision their politicians make on the united states , whether domestic or foreign , while bragging about how much more democratic they are than us . 
  people love a scapegoat or foreign boogeyman to shoulder responsibility for them . 
  otherwise they might actually have to be honest with themselves instead of parroting * `` my vote does n't matter '' * & * `` they 're all the same anyway '' * . 
   they are not risking anything by just paying the ransoms . 
  yes , but this is my point , * they are * . 
  if terrorists know that the serbian & croation governments are willing to pay ransoms without the bullshit , they 're much more likely to * target * innocent serbians & croations in kidnappings . 
  it 's feeding into a cycle & setting a precedent . 
  countless american hostages have been killed in the past * couple years * dealing with the * same group * , not just in accidental airstrikes & failed special operations raids , but also in beheading videos after ransom demands were outright refused . 
  even we 're not immune to these things or capable of preventing them a lot of the time . 
  in addition , it 's not just tiny countries like iceland & luxembourg doing it , it 's countries like [ germany & italy ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/world/africa/ransoming-citizens-europe-becomes-al-qaedas-patron.html ) too . 
  no , you 're right . 
  even though we did n't know exactly where those hostages were , we should 've called off a entire military campaign across a huge region & then vindicated the kidnapping of innocent civilians by terrorists as both a lucrative & effective tactic . 
  setting a precedent like that * surely * would n't backfire & end in countless more deaths . 
  you act like they do n't have the same * `` we do n't negotiate with terrorists over hostages '' * & * `` we do n't call off entire military campaigns because of human shields who 's exact locations we do n't know for certainty '' * . 
  it 's not like you have n't turned into a stable & peaceful country after that . 
  or that everybody in the region was committing genocide & invading everybody willy-nilly before that . 
  well , if you look at a map or compare how things have fared in serbia during the 2000s compared to the 1990s i would ... disagree ... 
  did you just compare putting a end to a decade of out-of-control widespread warfare & genocidal massacres of civilians by targeting legitimate targets to a terrorist attack against civilians in a peaceful , stable county ? 
  we did n't intervene seriously for around a decade . 
  your countries had all that time to not commit genocide & stop invading each other . 
  your countries did n't though . 
  although , really , i * do * sympathize with you . 
  serbia in the 2000s , after the intervention , seems to have been absolutely * terrible * compared to the decade before . 
  lol, 
  * ** serbia knew they were somewhere in libya , not exactly where . 
  ** * ** paying ransoms , giving into demands or calling off a entire military campaign across a huge region in relation to terrorists who kidnap innocent civilians is fucking retarded & only sets a valid precedent for more kidnappings ** * ** russia is known for having the same * `` we do n't negotiate with terrorists '' * attitude as us , and as much as our two countries disagree with each other , at least we agree on that , and if serbians hatejerk against us while circlejerking russia for doing the same shit , than i ca n't help but laugh at their hypocrisy **, 
  oh , have european nations gone back to paying ransoms & giving into demands over hostages like they 've been doing with extremists who use terrorist tactics for more than a decade ? 
  one can only guess why kidnapping still appears such a lucrative & effective tactic to these groups when it comes to europeans . 
  at least russia & the united states got shit right when it comes to negotiating with terrorists . 
  the rest of europe however ? 
  not so much ... 
  the alternative would 've been paying a ransom , thus both funding daesh & setting a precedent of negotiation with them , or calling off military action against them completely & justifying their tactic of using hostages as human shields . 
  both recourses of action above would 've only encouraged more kidnappings . 
  that 's even more retarded & disgusting than this . 
  yeah , with the exception of haiti , napoleon was a pretty fucking cool dude . 
  lol, 
  [ ** context ( * warning * : fucking hilarious ) ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z9hvo7p8dw ), 
   that was a french and british led operation ______________________________  obama declared an illegal war ______________________________  pulled out 30 days later . 
  ( legal length of time for a president to declare a war without the senate voting ) . 
  you 're contradicting yourself . 
  syria was after you pushed us into bombing libya & left us to do most the heavy-lifting for france in mali, 
  two dollars more ? 
  ** five guys is god damn delicious , but the prices are pretty crazy . 
  now taco bell ... that 's my shit ... cheap ass food that so god damn simple it 's hard to fuck up even if you tried ... 
  popeyes is better and if you disagree we can start the civil war 2.0 right here & now . 
  history also shows that those same dictators ' countries eventually implode due the fucked system they 've set-up or are invaded because of the retarded , egotistical bullshit they 've done against more powerful foes . 
  dictators just provide short-term stability in return for long-term instability , and democracy vice-versa . 
  i knew sweden 's intake was bad , but fuck me . 
  # ** nasa stronk ** # ** esa girly man **, 
  does the pope shit in the woods ? 
  i actually do n't find it strange when mexicans , italians or the french take pride in their food . 
  i see it * all the time * actually . 
  lol and you talk about me being defensive or aggressive , but i feel as if you 're implying i think i 'm a fucking astronaut or too stupid to realize i do n't work for nasa . 
  it 's like ... dude ... chill out . 
  we pay taxes & it 's a public agency under a democratic government . 
  you know what i 'm saying , you know where i 'm coming from , being pretentious about useless information that you throw under a microscope in the most passive aggressive way possible is more annoying than you being straight-up about it . 
  it just seems kinda ... pretentious & useless ... idk ... lol ... something that 's plainly obvious yet i feel as if you 're talking down to me or something like i need clarification ... 
  i mean ... yeah ... you root for your country at the olympics & talk about them as * `` us '' * ... but no shit you 're not a actual olympian ... 
  it 's like , you know , thanks captain obvious , you 're a real rhodes scholar there standing above the rest . 
  no lol do you feel strange seeing austrians self-identify with your country 's national soccer team ? 
   that 's only possible if we bundle all our space budgets and make esa the only space program in europe . 
  even after that , the esa would still have to increase it 's budget by like 40 % to match nasa 's funding . 
  the esa alone would have to increase it 's budget by around 321 % to match us , or convince all european national space agencies to fold into them permanently , but even then it would need a budget increase of aroud 40 % to match nasa . 
  and then the esa would have to jump-start it 's heavy-lift rocket programs and get ahead of us , despite the sls & falcon 9 heavy already being * well * into development and scheduled for their first flights in the next couple years . 
  the esa would have to increase it 's budget by like 321 % to match us . 
  * ** nasa funding : ** $ 19.3 billion ( * $ 17.6 billion * ) * ** esa funding : ** $ 6 billion ( * $ 5.5 billion * ) and even if you include * all * of europe 's national space agencies with the esa , it still only comes out to around to $ 12.7 billion ( * $ 11.6 billion * ) , or around 66 % of nasa 's budget . 
  plus the esa would have to jump-start it 's domestic rocket program for super-heavy rockets , match us & then * beat us * . 
  * [ ** falcon 9 heavy ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falcon_heavy ) - ** first flight ** - *** 2016 *** ; a heavy launch vehicle capable of lifting 53 metric tonnes into low-earth orbit & 21 metric tonnes into geosynchronous transfer orbit . 
  variant to be possibly reusable in the future . 
  * [ ** space launch system ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space_launch_system ) - ** first flight ** - *** 2018 *** ; a heavy expendable launch vehicle that will be the world 's most powerful rocket capable of carrying up to 130 metric tonnes to low-earth orbit & 45 metric tonnes to geosynchronous transfer orbit . 
  and i 'm not even going to mention darpa & military space funding , like that unmanned shuttle/drone that the air force had in orbit for a year or two , and then had land back home . 
  heh , that explains stockholm syndrome . 
  got ta make friends the hard way . 
  i do n't understand this at all , but for some reason i still find it hilarious . 
  lol, 
  yeah , but how many have put a [ unmanned space shuttle in orbit for * two * years ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/13/us/air-force-space-plane/index.html ) before landing it back home ? 
   nasa has a budget of 18,5 billion and russia 5,5 . 
  nasa 's 2016 budget is actually $ 19.3 billion * ( $ 17.6 billion ) * , and russia 's budget is actually about $ 2.3 billion * ( $ 2.11 billion ) * following the ruble 's collapse * ( but the russians are really , really good at making shit really , really cheap & having it last really , really long lol ) * . 
  * go home !, 
  when you factor those other countries ' budgets in on top of the esa 's budget , it comes out to around $ 12.7 billion * ( $ 11.6 billion ) * , which is around 66 % of nasa 's budget . 
  $ 19.3 billion for 2016 , or in other words $ 17.6 billion . 
  * lol * nasa is in the same league as pretty much every other space agency combined when it comes to funding . 
  the esa would have to increase it 's budget by like 643 % to double us * ( that 's also after already factoring in the article 's mentioned budget increase ) * . 
  and that 's not counting darpa & military spending either , like that unmanned shuttle the air force had in orbit for a couple years . 
  *** nasa stronk ***, 
  * rubs hands together * yes ... good ... good ... let the english flow through you ...

  you think eastern europe would rely more on any other european nation other than the united states & the british when it comes to russia ?
