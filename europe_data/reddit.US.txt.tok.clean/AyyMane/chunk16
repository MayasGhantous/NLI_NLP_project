  you think southern europe would trust any other european nation to keep shit cool between turkey & greece , or if everything goes to shit completely in north africa and they need a military response , other than the united states & british ? 
  france 's most important military partner right now is the united states . 
  if not for any other reason than africa . 
  get me when germany decides to up it 's defense spending to maintain a appropriate level of power projection to assist with shit like that , or better yet , actually willingly commit to serious military operations like that overseas . 
  you would have to get the french to trust & rely on the germans more than the british & americans when it comes to africa , get the eastern europeans to trust & rely on the germans more than the british & americans when it comes to russia and southern europe to trust & rely on the germans more than the americans when it comes to north africa/middle east , especially in regards to maintaining the calm between turkey & greece . 
  all militarily/intelligence speaking that is . 
  and let 's be real , how likely is it that germany is going to up defense spending or stare down russia when needed , much less go along with france on foreign adventures in africa in a serious fashion ? 
  probably southern florida , also known as northern cuba . 
  i 'm from central florida , also known as northern puerto rico or southern new york/new jersey . 
  this whole state is basically hispanic islanders & northern transplants . 
  we only got heavily involved after europe dropped the ball for the better part of a decade , being unable to stop total war in your own backyard even when it was interspersed with genocide , with the watershed moment being when the dutch allowed the mass-murder of innocent civilians right under their nose . 
  tell me , how many genocides & huge wars have broken out since the united states got directly & heavily involved ? 
  why in the world are you under the impression that the majority of saudi executions ar n't sunni ? 
   iran and the us do n't even have embassies . 
  gee whiz i wonder why . 
  lol, 
  personally i think israel & palestine should be combined into a single state that does n't revolve around a singular jewish or palestinian identity , but i 'm rather realistic in relation to the prospects of that given the present alternatives to israel 's course & i think we should play our strengths when it comes to picking stable allies in a chaotic , war-torn region . 
  why ? 
  do you have a better solution that does n't end in instability , all-out war or genocide ? 
  it 's / r/europe mane . 
  the monarchy did for most of the 20th century . 
  i mean , they used wahhabists initially to fight the ottomans & consolidate the country , so there 's always been a shared fabric , but they revolted afterwards and the king had no problem putting them down by force & pursuing a more western-influenced course afterwards . 
  like i pointed out above , saudi arabia was liberalizing at a rather steady rate all the way into the late 1970s . 
  but , once again , like i mentioned , the iranian revolution set a precedent & the mecca siege drove the point home . 
  even today there 's conflicts in their relationship & competition for influence . 
  i do n't know what we could 've done after 9/11 , probably something better , but maybe not . 
  the princes are more scared of the clerics than they are of west , and they believe they need the clerics more than the west to maintain their rule & legitimacy . 
  nor is it like al-qaeda had or has much love for the monarchy . 
  one of the biggest reasons for it 's founding was because the king invited western/christian boots onto the muslim holy land after he chose us to go up against saddam 's armored legions instead of osama 's rag-tag band of mujaheddin . 
  i do n't know , it 's a complicated situation . 
  * [ ** 2012 burgas bus bombing ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_burgas_bus_bombing ) * [ ** 2012 cyprus terrorist plot ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_cyprus_terrorist_plot ), 
  well , to be fair , before the iranian revolution & mecca siege , saudi arabia * was * liberalizing at a steady-rate , and even after that , influence over them has helped with maintaining economic stability , a fact we did n't really truly appreciate the importance of until the 1970s oil embargo which brought most of our economies to a grind . 
  plus , any western or non-muslim country which even tangentially involves itself in the middle east derives a big benefit from a friendly government in the muslim holy land , not to mention the huge multiplier it gives us in soft power when negotiating with other sunni countries . 
  but it 's gotten to the point though , as far as saudi arabia goes socially , where we can only do so much . 
  like i mentioned above , when the iranian revolution happened , with a american-supported middle eastern kingdom being overthrown by religious fundamentalists , it scared the ever-living shit out of the saudis for obvious reasons , and when the mecca siege happened , it kicked the monarchy into high gear cracking down on liberal values to placate the clerics to avoid a repeat of something like iran happening there . 
  i think the royals look at it like this . 
  the kingdom * can * fall , but the clerics * will * stay . 
  and a american alliance , no matter how strong it is , wo n't gurantee them protection from that as demonstrated with the shah . 
  and if anybody knows how to fix that , or knows how to stop a even worse variable entering the equation should the monarchy fall , than i 'm all ears . 
  lol, 
   saudi arabia , or specifically their government , kill more people and sustain a far more oppressive quality of life . 
  statistically iran executes more , but do you know how much more brutal saudi arabian society is ? 
  i guarantee you there is much more death and suffering in saudi arabia than iran . 
  except that iran has a homicide rate [ 4.8 x ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) that of saudi arabia ; 3,126 murder victims to saudi arabia 's 235 murder victims . 
  dude , shut up . 
  lol, 
  bruv , not something for us to comment on . 
  every other american here commenting was pissing me off to no end . 
  but you ... you get a pass ... if only for those who gave their lives during the great galactic war of '97 * ( which was won single-handily by america ... you 're welcome world ) * . 
  yeah , but do n't get me wrong , i still think the saudis are pretty fucking terrible , and i also support the iranian nuclear deal as well as the cold-shoulder obama 's given israel when needed , but still , the way people circlejerk over iran on this site boggles my mind . 
  lol, 
  well , to be fair , iran does have dozens of sunnis on deathrow and have already executed countless more in the past year , for the same type of bullshit religious/political reasons that saudi executed that cleric over * ( which should n't be surprising , since the iranian execution rate is the highest in the world per capita for years in the running , far outstripping the ksa 's rate ) * . 
  not to mention fueling sectarian killings in iraq , as well as the political/social isolation of sunnis there , & propping up a authoritarian shia dictator in syria despite it being a sunni-majority country , as well as constant threats to close of the strait of hormuz which would cripple the kingdom economically . 
  this is a lot more complicated than * `` saudi = bad , iranian = good '' * that people like to boil it down too . 
  lol, 
  are they ? 
  they 're a highly conservative islamic theocracy who execute a fuckton more people than saudi arabia for the same reasons as saudi arabia , fuel sectarian warfare across the region , are one of the primary causes for the de-stabilization of iraq given the sectarian influence they had over maliki with their militias who he turned to for backing * ( in addition to having helped fuel the insurgency for damn near a decade ) * , have close ties with russia & are committed to the destruction of the most liberal & western-styled democracy in the middle east * ( which is n't saying much , but still ) * . 
  not to mention influence over saudi arabia helps prevent a repeat of the 1970s oil embargo , which brought * all * our economies to a grind , and provides a friendly government which presides over the muslim holy land * ( rather important even if you 're only tangentially involved in the middle east as a western or christian-majority country ) * . 
  i mean , if anything they 're equal with the saudis for being fucked , and at best just a little better , but is that tiny bit better enough to outweigh the geopolitical benefits of our relationship with saudi ? 
  that said i do agree with the iranian nuclear deal . 
  [ ** iran to execute 27 sunni muslims ** ] ( https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/23016-iran-to-execute-27-sunni-muslims ) - *** december 24th , 2015 ***  iran 's supreme court in tehran has approved the execution of 27 sunni muslims , anadolu reported rights groups saying yesterday . 
   the iranian agency of human rights activists ( hrana ) said that the supreme court approved the execution of the culprits who were arrested by the iranian intelligence services between 2009 and 2011 [ ** iran executes six sunni muslim ethnic kurds ** ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/iran-executes-six-sunni-muslim-ethnic-kurds/26881877.html ) - *** january 3rd , 2016 ***  six iranian kurds have reportedly been executed despite human right defenders ' calls on iranian authorities to spare their lives . 
   the norway-based iran human rights ( * ihr * ) group said the sunni muslim men were executed early on march 4 inside rajai shahr prison in the city of karaj , near tehran . 
   on march 3 , amnesty international renewed its call not to hang the six inmates , who it said had gone on a hunger strike . 
   the london-based group said they were sentenced to death after being found guilty of the offense of '' * enmity against god * '' . 
   ______________________________________  all of them maintain that they were targeted solely because they practiced or promoted their faith . 
  sympathizing with iran over the saudi execution rate never really made sense to me given that iran executes a fuckton more people over the same shit , including numerous sunnis for their religious/political beliefs . 
  i also never understood why the reddit hivemind likes to think a highly-conserative islamic theocracy which fuels sectarian warfare across the region & is committed to the destruction of the most liberal and western-styled democracy in the middle east * ( an despite israel 's very real & serious faults that they should absolutely be criticized for , that 's still accurate ) * is only a couple steps away from being a secular scandinavian democracy . 
  lol  iranian executions last year were around 6x times higher than the saudi rate , and 9x times higher than the saudi rate the year before that . 
   in fact , iranians are now being [ executed at a higher rate ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/iran-execution-rate-number-iran-executions-higher-under-president-hassan-rouhani-1716446 ) under rouhani than under ahmadinejad , with 2,060 executions altogether .

  we go after bp because they caused a major oil spill that caused massive environmental damage in our country , and go after volkswagen because they committed wide-scale fraud which contributed to unchecked pollution across our entire country , but yet * we 're * the protectionist assholes ? 
  ... lol ... 
  i 'm not freaking out ? 
  lol just making fun of some german redditors for their attachment to volkswagen & knee-jerk responses to people criticizing it over things that ca n't even be denied . 
  well , i mean , he kinda is . 
  a german car manufacturer has been caught red-handed & he 's automatically looking for a way to distract from it or justify it by demonizing us despite there being no evidence to the contrary for his claims . 
  not to mention the chances already being pretty high that the german government probably * immediately * began testing american cars to chance saving some face after the initial findings months ago . 
  in addition , he * specifically * called out the car manufacturers of the united states , with no attention paid or mention given to any other car manufacturer anywhere else on the globe . 
  although , has anyone tested mercedes-benz & bmw cars that are sold anywhere anyways ? 
  would be a fun little experiment imho . 
  passive aggressive german redditors on this are the cutest . 
  lol a lot act like their national identity is under attack or something & they do n't know how to respond to it coherently . 
  i 've enjoyed licking up the tears . 
  yeah , no shit , but once again , the fact that the french are opposed to assad even more than we are , and the huge conflict of interest that exists between us & turkey when it comes to the ypg , shows how flawed your argument is . 
  you can dress it up anyway you want , but the above points stand . 
  big words & emotional declarations do n't change the fact that the french straight up hate assad * even more * than we do & our most important allies in syria are the kurdish ypg whom the turks absolutely hate given their ties to the pkk . 
  there is no concrete european solidarity , let alone american/turkish solidarity really , in light of syria . 
  so , given that , you clearly * do n't * have a clear understanding of existing power structures in the region or the sitaution at hand . 
  lol, 
  ** * the french hate assad even more than we fucking do . 
  they lost their shit when we pulled out from bombing him back in 2012 by cutting that deal * ( one of the reasons they delayed bombing daesh in syria for so long , as they wanted it be conditional on also bombing assad , which we refused ) * , and on top of that , them & the british are the ones which pushed us into libya * american interests in syria conflict with even turkey given our immense support to , and deep cooperation with , the kurdish ypg * finland is n't even in nato , but operates under the * de facto * assumption we 'll come bail you guys out if shit gets hot between you & russia ... you basically get the security gurantee without the security commitment ... so ... wtf does finland have to say when it comes to * `` shared interests , nato & the need for commitment '' * ? 
  lol, 
  that was actually a problem in the marine 's trial program . 
  men would disobey orders & put themselves at extra risk when a woman was injured or needed help compared to a man , hurting unit cohesion . 
  the poverty rate in germany is the same as ours though ... and can i hear your problems with the f-35 ? 
  especially in the context of it 's european competitors own development cycles & price ?
