  lol, 
  you can be both religious & secular . 
  in fact , that 's how it 's mostly been for the longest amount of time . 
  the european union is n't europe like the united states of america is n't america . 
  it 's semantics and you know it . 
  and refugees , by definition , * are * immigrants , just a certain type of immigrant . 
  schnegen , the refugee quotas & external border security are actually ... * all * relevant to my point ... as my point is immigration & european integration . 
  if you would like to explain how all of the above does n't directly relate to both immigration & european integration than i am all ears . 
  lol we 've also agreed to take in 10,000 syrian refugees , and have provided the most funds out of anybody to syrian refugees globally-speaking speaking . 
  although i agree we should be doing much more & taking in a lot more . 
  ever since the combined build-up of the schengen agreement , maastricht treaty & treaty of lisbon , in addition to the recently assigned refugee quotas & recent agreement on external border security , one could argue there very much is . 
  it might seem really confusing & contradictory at first , but i 've heard it off-handily explained like this before : * `` americans dislike immigration politically , but like immigrants socially , while europeans like immigration politically , but dislike immigrants socially . 
  * not really the most academic , nuanced or concrete of explanations , but that 's the most , at least for me , understandable way i 've seen this type of thing rationalized . 
  in the context of october being a record-setting month . 
   the united states has some of the most hostile policies toward an immigrant population found in the developed world . 
   start with the special police forces dedicated to persecuting and deporting over a quarter of the nation 's immigrants , the [ estimated 11 million ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/ ) who entered the country without authorization . 
  then there is the lack of labor laws to shield them from wage theft and perilous jobs . 
   and do n't get me started on america 's stingy social insurance : even legal permanent residents are barred from a host of government programs , including medicaid , food stamps and other welfare programs . 
   so why is it that immigrants in the united states -- including those here illegally -- have managed to integrate far more successfully into the american economy and social fabric than foreigners arriving to the relatively coddled states of the european union , where they often enjoy access right away to a panoply of rights and benefits ? 
   the difference is worth pondering . 
   ____________________________________________________  contrasting the experiences in europe and the united states could help us better enable immigrants and their descendants to find their identities and flourish in the new world in which they live . 
  and it will improve the prospects for greater economic growth and less strife for the rest of us . 
   the very notion of integration is nebulous of course . 
  by some standards one could say immigrants to the united states integrate poorly . 
  rates of naturalization are low . 
  less-educated immigrants often work for very low wages . 
  immigrant poverty rates are substantially higher in the united states than in the european union . 
   _____________________________________________________  yet progress is evident . 
  reporting among some of the poorest illegal immigrants toiling on america 's farms and construction sites , i have encountered a sense of achievement and possibility that belies their harsh living conditions . 
  it [ contrasts markedly ] ( http://image.slidesharecdn.com/indicatorsofimmigrantintegration-settlingin2015-150630153508-lva1-app6892/95/indicators-of-immigrant-integration-settling-in-2015-14-1024.jpg?cb=1435827601 ) with the sense of exclusion and alienation reported from immigrant enclaves across europe . 
   a [ report released in september ] ( http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?recordid=21746 ) by the national academies of sciences , engineering and medicine noted that more immigrants buy into the american dream than do native-born americans : 70 percent believe their children will be better off than themselves , up from 60 percent 20 years ago . 
  among american-born parents , only 50 percent believe that . 
   in fact , the children of the least-educated immigrants are much better educated than their parents . 
  they find much better jobs . 
   `` * current immigrants and their descendants are integrating into u.s. society , * '' the report concluded . 
  `` * integration increases over time , with immigrants becoming more like the native-born with more time in the country , and with the second and third generations becoming more like other native-born americans than their parents were * '' . 
   ________________________________________  still , they identify unique hurdles in the way of immigrants that make it difficult for those coming from outside the european union to get ahead in europe . 
   among the most notable is clearly europe 's segmented labor market , difficult for newcomers to crack . 
  in the united states , less-educated immigrants may work for little pay . 
  but the vast majority of them work . 
  the employment rate of immigrants is higher than that of natives . 
  [ in europe it is lower ] ( http://www.slideshare.net/oecd_els/indicators-of-immigrant-integration-settling-in-2015/6?utm_source=slideview&amp;utm_medium=ssemail&amp;utm_campaign=share_clip ) . 
   a [ report about the integration of immigrants ] ( http://www.oecd.org/migration/indicators-of-immigrant-integration-2015-settling-in-9789264234024-en.htm ) issued over the summer by the organization for economic cooperation and development noted that more than a fifth of europe 's immigrants from outside the european union were unemployed , about double the rate of european union citizens . 
   one in four of the economically active is out of work in france and one in three in belgium and sweden . 
  and these poor employment prospects persist down the generations . 
  youth joblessness among the european-born children of immigrants is almost 50 percent higher than for those with native-born parents . 
   employment is not the only barrier . 
  children from less-educated immigrant families are much [ less likely to succeed at school ] ( http://www.slideshare.net/oecd_els/indicators-of-immigrant-integration-settling-in-2015/10?utm_source=slideview&amp;utm_medium=ssemail&amp;utm_campaign=share_clip ) in europe than the sons and daughters of natives , and much more likely to [ end up marginalized ] ( http://www.slideshare.net/oecd_els/indicators-of-immigrant-integration-settling-in-2015/11?utm_source=slideview&amp;utm_medium=ssemail&amp;utm_campaign=share_clip ) : out of school and out of work . 
  [ immigrants feel discriminated against ] ( http://www.slideshare.net/oecd_els/indicators-of-immigrant-integration-settling-in-2015/13?utm_source=slideview&amp;utm_medium=ssemail&amp;utm_campaign=share_clip ) more often in europe . 
  perceived discrimination is particularly acute among the european-born children of immigrants , who in several countries still do not qualify for automatic citizenship . 
   as professor foner put it : * `` the united states does a better job at accepting immigrants as americans in the making '' * . 
   ________________________________________________  and yet , across most of europe , [ voters want to limit immigration ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/12/chapter-3-most-support-limiting-immigration/?beta=true&amp;utm_expid=53098246-2.lly4cfsvqg2lphsg-kopig.1&amp;utm_referrer=https%3a%2f%2fwww.google.com%2f ) . 
  majorities in many european countries see immigrants as an economic burden and as people who refuse to assimilate . 
  for all the hatred of immigrants stirred up by mr. trump and other republican hopefuls , most americans -- 63 percent in 2014 , according to the national academies report -- still believe immigration is a good thing . 
  majorities across the political spectrum favor granting illegal immigrants [ a path toward legal status ] ( http://www.people-press.org/files/2015/10/10-08-15-immigration_06.png ) . 
   the united states is a nation of hyphenated identities . 
  europe 's nation-states , deeply rooted in history , are not . 
  the boxer is sexy . 
  * guys breaks into your neighbor 's house , shoots him in the leg , robs his living room & occupies his garage . 
  * you ask the police to fine him to deter him from doing it to you . 
  * police laugh at you & tell you to stop being such a paranoid pussy *, 
   canada would be reluctant to sign up to a new type of investor protection system , while eu members had 1,400 existing trade deals with isds not to mention the first modern one was pioneered by germany with pakistan in the late 1950s . 
  and people wonder why others are so annoyed by european hypocrisy & holier-than-thou attitude on this . 
  i was more referencing the sentiment of :  what the hell , there are european states worse than the us ? 
  in this general area , as opposed to this specifically . 
  especially when it 's coming from somebody with irish flair when ireland had the 2nd highest outbreak of mad cow disease overall . 
   not feeding cattle grass is excelled at by the us . 
  yep , we 're so shit we 've only had ** 4 bse cases & 3 cvjd cases ** compared to europe 's ** 186,165 bse cases & 219 cvjd cases ** * ( with the 2nd highest bse outbreak being in ireland no less with 1,353 cases ) * , or the rest of the world 's ** 48 bse cases & 6 cvjd cases ** . 
  yeah . 
  of course there are . 
  why is this surprising to anybody who does n't have their own head up their ass in the most pretentious way possible ? 
  lol there 's a reason that mad cow disease started , and had it 's worst outbreaks in , europe . 
  if the japanese military was on the verge of surrendering before the nukes were dropped they would n't of tried to kidnap the emperor & isolate him so he could n't broadcast the order * after * the nukes were dropped . 
  also , the soviets had no capability really to launch a full-out amphibious invasion of japan . 
  slavs & eastern europeans are considered pretty god damn white . 
  turks would probably be considered either like italian or greek , and thus white , or mexican ... and thus ... mexican . 
  heh , and i always thought that the vampiric conclave met in romania . 
  til, 
  i have no idea why we were n't keen on propping up milosevic with foreign aid after he hijacked the already disintegrating yugoslavian government . 
  * not the slightest . 
  * his political views seemed so moderate before he took the reigns & his actions afterwards so balanced . 
  it 's not like he was a genocidal ethnic nationalist or anything . 
  and yes , gladio was absolutely fucked , but the program & it 's consequences are well-known . 
  oh no , we provided military & economic aid to ukraine when they were being invaded and economically strangled ? 
  ** how terrible & nefarious !!!, 
  ** who would do such a thing ? 
  also , the euro tanking probably has more to do with a potential grexit , the growing threat of a brexit , austerity , stagnant growth that does n't let up & the institution of qe more than it does with ukraine or america . 
  so do n't blame us because europe does n't have a proper fiscal & political union to underpin it 's currency union . 
  and ah , yes , those god damned * `` soft coups '' * that we also carried out with the extensive cooperation of our european allies which you make no mention of . 
  lol the kind of nefarious , publicly-announced , publicly-outlined & rather transparent meddling which involves championing the democratic process & focusing on non-violent reform . 
  ** no , really , that 's literally what your report says . 
  ** and i wonder why clearly-announced public programs which champion democracy , non-violence & a more liberal political atmosphere is such a danger to those aforementioned countries ? 
  also , what would you call that conditional trade agreement pushed hard as shit by the european union & the following loud condemnation of the government than a * `` soft coup '' * by the eu ? 
  i mean . . if this is our definition ... and how is it completely outside of our sphere-of-influence ? 
  are we not the lynchpin of nato , the european union 's closest foreign partner , largest trading partner & the country which threw it 's full-diplomatic weight behind the eu 's creation & integration for more than a half-a-century ? 
  and everybody is in everybody 's business . 
  can you name one country that is n't ? 
  especially in a world more & more affected by globalization by the day ? 
  i 'll support isolationism the day russia , china , the european union , or hell , even individual european countries , fuck off and drop every move they make outside of their borders . 
  lol and world police ?
