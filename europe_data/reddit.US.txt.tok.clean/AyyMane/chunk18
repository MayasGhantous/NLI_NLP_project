  i never said we 're world police . 
  but what do you call the only remaining super power , the guarantee of the world 's shipping lanes , the country who helps ensure the defense of numerous allied countries across the world , from europe to the middle east to asia , and a sitting member of the united nations security council ? 
  as for biden 's son , eh , i got no defense for that . 
  he is a graduate of yale , a high-placed new york lawyer & a adjunct professor at georgetown university 's school of foreign service , so it 's not like his resume is lacking , but it 's bad press with his dad & should n't of happened . 
  although , what 's your implication ? 
  that only russians can work & get good jobs in ukraine when it comes to foreigners ? 
  lol, 
  eh , fair enough . 
  lol, 
  outside of a nato framework & without the cooperation of the european union ? 
  even the balkans had all that with a unsc resolution on top of it , and we basically let europe take the reigns on that for the better part of a decade before we * really * got involved . 
  ** obama did n't annex crimea , obama did n't invade eastern ukraine , obama did n't try to strangle ukraine with energy games . 
  in addition , the european union , spearheaded by germany , are the ones that lit the spark & fanned the flames for the revolution by pushing that conditional trade agreement so heavily , under some retarded assumption that germany 's fondness for russia and willingness to screw over eastern europe with shit like nordstream to negate some american influence would appease russia enough not be bothered by the eu handicapping their eurasian union before it got off the ground & stealing their canada away . 
  and what did the european union & germany do once shit hit the fan with the revolution & push came to shove with the russian invasion ? 
  ** nothing . 
  ** it abandoned ukraine & collapsed into in-fighting . 
  america was the one that actually had the balls to jump in , try to get a grip on the mess , help prop up ukraine & give europe some breathing room to get back on it 's feet . 
  and what do many germans & other western europeans on the internet say * now * ? 
  that * we * created it , that * we * mishandled it , that * we * forced them into it . 
  so yeah , you know what , thank you obama . 
  for not having a completely retarded foreign policy like germany & not being too much of a pussy to actually confront russia on invading a european country right on the border of nato & the eu . 
  ** that video is exactly my point . 
  ** the eu helped create the whole mess , which i do n't really hold a opinion on , but when push comes to shove with the revolution & russian invasion , what did it do ? 
  nothing . 
  it collapsed into itself . 
  we come in , and what does it do ? 
  nothing . 
  of course we 're going to get annoyed & just say * `` fuck it '' * and try to push shit through the united nations instead . 
  you ca n't be incompetent in creating a mess , draw us into it , and then be useless in helping us in gaining control of it without really , really annoying us . 
   if we go in details you started most of these conflict . 
  ah , yeah , we started the yugoslav wars & single-handily forced , and then puppeteered , the eu 's relationship with ukraine , and then forced russia to invade . 
  totally no fault on the eu or russia 's part . 
  ** once again , exactly my point . 
  ** when shit hits the fan , especially in regards to eu incompetence , we get * all * the blame by * everybody * , our allies completely forget their part in anything , and then demand why the end-result to a hugely complicated situation on the otherside of the world from us is n't perfect after a relatively short-amount of time to respond . 
  ... man the whole reason * we went there * was because the proto-eu dropped the fucking ball for a decade in regards to the region . 
  but now we get * all * the hate from the rest of europe for the shit not being * perfect * & like * all * the hate from serbs for whatever the hell they 're mad about . 
  why ca n't ya 'll make the hard decisions for once when the going get 's tough ? 
  same shit with ukraine . 
  european union pushes conditional treaty on ukraine , european union loudly condemns ukrainian government 's treatment of those protesting treaty 's turndown , european union demands imprisoned opposition leader 's immediate release , then revolution happens & russia invades , european union 's united front implodes , infighting erupts across the board , everybody forgets about ukraine and then america rushes in to picks up the pieces until the european union can get back on it 's feet , but by that point all of russia now hates america like almost exclusively & everybody else is saying * we * started it or that * we * did n't act fast enough , even the eu . 
  as far as regional affairs like this go , the european union goes in , fucks up , than we come in , salvage what we can , but get blamed by them for shit not being perfect while everybody on the other side of the fence almost ignore 's the eu part completely while treating us like the great satan . 
  the whole god damn continent is like a geopolitical cocktease . 
  acting like it * totally * does n't want to live with us anymore and can * totally * take care of itself , about how we should * definitely * go live with our asian girlfriend , but the minute we start to leave the neighbor 's house implodes . 
   the british queen elizabeth class will probably be just about large enough to properly classify as an aircraft carrier not like it matters . 
  the rn should 've just got four god damn amphibous assault ships that could 've offered * so much more * flexibility instead of two huge carriers if they 're not going to go the extra mile for cats & traps and are * only * going to operate the f-35b instead of getting some of the * ( i think even cheaper ) * f-35c . 
  and do n't get me started on the lack of nuclear reactors . 
  i feel like westminister just wanted a pretty trophy on the cheap , not a actual increase in operational capability or a fully-capable aircraft carrier . 
  they put no investment beyond the bare minimum and thought up no alternative as a back-up plan . 
  the gripen ng has a estimated [ ** $ 113 million ** ] ( http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/fordon_motor/flygplan/article3601869.ece ) fly-away cost right now , so it 's actually more expensive than the f-35 , which just hit [ $ 108 million ] ( http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2015-03-19/pentagon-revises-down-estimated-cost-f-35-fighter ) in lrip-8 * ( down $ 4.5 million from lrip-7 & $ 8.5 million from lrip-6 ) * and is projected to drop as low as [ $ 80-85 million ] ( http://www.star-telegram.com/news/business/aviation/article37384614.html ) once full-production really heats up * ( 1,899 orders , or enough to pop out one-a-day for five years , and that 's not counting the other 506 planned either , tends to put some downward pressure on pricing ) * . 
  oh , and maintenance ? 
  compared to the f-35a 's [ $ 24,000 ] ( http://www.avioners.net/2013/05/pentagon-and-f-35-operating-cost.html/ ) cost per flight hour ? 
  lol and the other guy who replied to you also said something you did n't mention :  the ng is * to expensive * to make a significant advantage compared to it 's competitors since it has such a small payload and yet you 're over here acting like it 's the cheapest thing on the block with the biggest bang for the buck . 
  lol, 
   corporate state like the us . 
  dude , your country is like the size of fucking north carolina , but at the same time you 're one of the largest arms dealers in the world selling to every tom , dick & jerry across the globe . 
  i mean , you * literally * sell more guns than we do per capita . 
  and to top it all off , you 're also cutting down on defense spending at home by outsourcing the shit to your neighbors & us * ( without actually ... you know . . being apart of nato or forming some sorta scandinavian military alliance ... thus you guys avoid actually obligating yourselves to actually helping anyone if shit hits the fan ) * , while fucking increasing your arms sales abroad . 
  or , in other words , you 've actually managed to somehow get us to help you lower your tax burden & maximize your profits without us actually getting any firm commitments or guarantees in return which ... honestly ... i 'm not even really mad about ... because i 'm actually kinda impressed ... but still ... you know ... hop off your own dick . 
  lol ** edit : ** also , the gripen ng is n't going to be affordable . 
  lol it 's going to be in the same price range as the f-35 and i can pretty much bet it 's not gon na be as stealthy or have sensors as advanced . 
  the eurozone 's debt level was around [ 92.9 % ] ( https://www.rt.com/business/310490-eurozone-countries-total-debt/ ) by the end of the first quarter this year and it was only around 1/7th the way though the initial stimulus plan , which has been expanded another 6-months and in total costs around [ $ 1.36 tn ] ( http://www.hngn.com/articles/156970/20151204/ecb-cuts-interest-rates-extends-asset-purchasing-plan-until-march.htm ) , or 1/11 of the eurozone 's gdp . 
  that is n't much better than the united states with our 103 % ... especially when around 1/3rd of that is held by inter-governmental agencies & around another 1/3rd by american citizens . 
  we also ended qe [ last year ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-29823798 ) , the deficit is at it 's [ lowest ] ( http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/deficit-shrinks-1-trillion-obama-era ) since the great recession for the third year in a row , our economy is a global brightspot with decent growth & we have low employment ... compared to stagnant growth in the eurozone & pretty much twice the unemployment ... and as most would tell you , the best way to combat debt it growth , and we 're growing faster & in a lot broader way than the eurozone . 
  so ... yeah ... there 's all that . 
   oh , and we actually have a firm , tightly integrated fiscal & political union to cement our monetary union as well , unlie with the eurozone . 
  i would n't worry too much about us . 
  lol, 
  also , i think , why you had things like the ecb raising interest rates in 2011 , despite being at the height of the european debt crisis , in the throes of the first grexit crisis & afflicted with the type of stagnant growth that would eventually lead to a double-dip recession . 
  * ** the [ federal reserve ] ( http://www.global-rates.com/interest-rates/central-banks/central-bank-america/fed-interest-rate.aspx ) & [ european central bank ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/monetary/rates/html/index.en.html ) have a present interest rate of .25 % & -.3 % respectfully ** * ** the last time the federal reserve cut interest rates was in [ 2008 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/business/economy/17fed.html?pagewanted=all ) by 3.25 % ; the last time the european central bank cut interest rates was [ this year ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/03/investing/european-central-bank-cuts-rates/ ) by .1 % ** * ** the last time the federal reserve raised interest rates was in [ 2006 ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/08/economist-explains-21 ) by 1.25 % ; the last time the european central bank raised interest rates was in [ 2011 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/articles/07072011130714.htm ) by .5 % ** * ** the federal reserve has implied it will officially recommend raising the interest rate [ this month ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-yellen-iduskbn0tl21r20151202 ) ; the european central bank has implied that present interest rates will be maintained until [ 2018 ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c84c5e0a-8de0-11e5-a549-b89a1dfede9b.html ) ** * ** the federal reserve ended it 's quantitative easing program in [ 2014 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-29823798 ) after spending $ 3.7 tn & having started it at the tail-end of 2008 ; the european central bank has extended it 's quantitative easing program to [ 2017 ] ( http://www.hngn.com/articles/156970/20151204/ecb-cuts-interest-rates-extends-asset-purchasing-plan-until-march.htm ) with plans to spend around $ 1.38 tn , having begun it at the start of this year **, 
   ** europe 's central bank just lowered interest rates as america 's looks ready for a liftoff . 
  **  american and european monetary policies are expected to seesaw this month , with the european central bank on thursday announcing a further interest rate cut just as the u.s. is preparing to lift its own rates for the first time in nearly a decade . 
   as it seeks to accomplish its [ dual mandate ] ( https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/speeches/our-dual-mandate ) , the federal reserve does n't explicitly care about foreign monetary policies , so the ecb 's shift is unlikely to do much to rock the interest rate boat in the u.s.  still , it 's hard to ignore such divergent monetary policies in two of the world 's largest , most closely linked economies . 
   ______________________________________  european rates have been held in negative territory since mid-2014 . 
  the benchmark rate in the u.s. , on the other hand , has been held at near-zero since 2008 , but has yet to dip below zero . 
   ______________________________________  international monetary policies have generally moved in the same direction throughout the global economic recovery , so this month could bring about a rare period of divergence should fed officials decide to lift america 's rates at the federal open market committee 's next meeting . 
   america 's gross domestic product was hit harder by the global financial crisis than the 19-country euro currency bloc , but quarterly economic growth in the u.s. has been head and shoulders above its european counterparts throughout the recovery . 
   and although a nation 's economic growth is driven by plenty of factors , the myriad young employees in the u.s. workforce may have helped drive domestic performance at a faster rate than europe could match . 
   _______________________________________  the [ census bureau ] ( https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-113.html ) estimates there are more than 83 million millennials living in the u.s. , representing about a quarter of the country 's total population . 
  and the [ pew research center ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/11/millennials-surpass-gen-xers-as-the-largest-generation-in-u-s-labor-force/ ) earlier this year said millennials have overtaken both baby boomers and generation xers as the largest generation of employees in the u.s. labor market . 
   europe , on the other hand , has been dealing with an [ aging workforce ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/jobs/10634819/employers-face-new-challenges-from-ageing-workforce.html ) and [ declining fertility rates ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/fertility_statistics ) . 
  and since the ecb ca n't do very much to fix the area 's alarming demographic shifts , it 's being forced to extend its accommodative policies deeper and longer than the u.s. has . 
  the article is actually riddled with typos & weird sentence structure , but it had the best-sounding title ... so ... eh ... i went with it . 
  i feel like it was a italian press release and they just ran it through google translate or something . 
  lol, 
  not as much as you might think . 
  italy 's the first one to get it assembled & delivered * at home * , but the others have them , just they 're picking them up & initially training on them in the united states instead before bringing them home . 
  the ironic part is that i think , as a paragraph or two down reports , italy is going to be flying them to america for training as well . 
  lol so i guess the big thing here is that the planes are assembled & delivered in europe . 
   ** the first f-35 delivered outside the u.s. was taken on charge by the italian air force . 
  **  on dec. 3 , lt. gen. pasquale preziosa , chief of the italian air force , welcomed the first italian f-35a at the f-35 final assembly and check out ( faco ) facility at cameri , in northwestern italy . 
   not only is the al-1 ( * as the aircraft is designated * ) the first f-35 for the italian armed forces but it is also the first assembled and delivered outside the u.s.  with the delivery of its first aircraft , italy becomes the sixth nation to receive an f-35 joining australia , netherlands , norway , united kingdom and the u.s. that already operate the aircraft at various airbase across the united states . 
  yeah , one was a highly-visible & flagged operation in international waters to keep a vital shipping lane open at the begging of a local country who 's tankers were being attacked & sunk . 
  another was a black operation in the middle of a foreign country under a false-flag in support of separatists . 
  wider context is important . 
  no , that 's my point , * i am * thanking germany . 
  lol only it could alienate russia while trying to move closer to russia & increase the influence of the united states while trying to minimize the influence of the united states . 
  some might say it was in the context of a iraqi plane almost sinking a american warship in the * same area * only a * year * beforehand when we were hesitant to shoot it down . 
  not to say what happened was justified really , but the picture is * a lot fucking different * than how you 're painting it . 
  lol, 
  except we were actually withdrawing from europe militarily , germany was the one that initially led the charge on ukraine & as for the european union ... well ... everybody else on the continent ca n't work together for shit under a german-spearheaded initiative . 
  i mean , we were busy focusing on our pivot to asia , but yeah , maintaining a little bit of influence in europe at the cost of a german-russian alliance would 've been cool , not exactly our top priority in regards to china , although sure .
