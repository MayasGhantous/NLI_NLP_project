  but we did n't really throw in a lot of effort to stop the above alliance or change the way the wind was blowing in context . 
  luckily however , germany 's retarded foreign policy & the european union 's hilarious incompetence in regards to it did it for us . 
  lmao, 
  we did n't , and that 's why germany was * really , really * surprised that we were spying on them after they built nordstream & endangered the economic security of most of eastern europe * ( and the general security of parts of northern europe like with sweden ) * in pursuit of stonger ties with russia . 
  but it 's cool , because then germany decided it was a good idea to try and bring ukraine into it 's sphere-of-influence with pushing that conditional trade agreement so hard , loud condemnation of the ukrainian government when people were protesting them turning it down & constant demands for that one chick 's release . 
  and , of course , surprise surprise , russia did n't like the idea of their canada joining the european union , and their eurasian union being handicapped before it even got off the ground , and the german-spearheaded european union was so god damn dysfunctional it could n't handle a response to the inevitable russian invasion by itself and basically collapsed into itself on the united front angle , forcing america 's hand until it could get back on it 's feet . 
  we did n't even have to do anything . 
  germany played itself & the european union was so god damn incompetent under it 's direction it could n't handle the aftermath by itself . 
  ** edit : ** i mean , seriously , wtf goes through the german government 's head ? 
  * `` omg !, 
  the americans are spying on us after we just tried to geopolitically assfuck them out of more than half-a-century of investment & hard-work on the continent with the same institutions they helped build up !, 
  '' * , followed shortly by , * `` omg !, 
  the russians are invading ukraine after we just tried to geopolitically ass-fuck them out of more than a couple centuries of hard work on their part trying to reign ukraine into their sphere-of-influence !, 
  i usually never get a chance to upvote you / u/homsig , but you get this one . 
  i 'm sorry mr. erdogan , but bird law in your country is just not governed by reason . 
  * - tear - * * - bald eagle caw - *, 
  i always hear that , but i was n't sure just * how * prevalent it was & just * how much * of a effect it had on the average person . 
  i 've never traveled outside the country myself so i do n't really have a relative experience to draw from for context . 
  ** edit : ** also , lol , eurotrip . 
  * crickets *, 
  well , to be honest , since he only committed misdemeanors , he would n't really be considered a * `` con or ex-con '' * in the sense you 're implying . 
  i mean , he would , * technically * , but the notion & tone that invokes is more in reference to convicted felons , which he is n't . 
  ** it 's like everytime you talk about the military or anything even relatively right-leaning it becomes about * `` history repeating itself & going down the same roads as before '' * , about how * `` hitler was just human & if you 're not careful it can happen to you '' * or on some pretentious * `` we 've been here before , we 've seen war ( well , not us specifically ) , so we know what we 're talking about here better than you '' * . 
  it 's like jesus christ , germany , you make it seem like if your military spending ever hits 2 % you 'll all turn into a bunch of god damn [ werenazis ] ( http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/m/mv5bmja0mdcxnjuxof5bml5banbnxkftztcwntg2mtkynw@@._v1_sx640_sy720_.jpg ) the next full-moon and immediately start making preparations for the invasion of israel . 
   * `` there is no future ( in syria ) with assad , nor will there be any level of coopeation with troup who are under assad 's command , '' * she said . 
  interesting . 
   u.s. president barack obama met with russian president vladimir putin on monday and plans to meet with turkish president tayyip erdogan on tuesday at the climate summit in paris , white house deputy national security adviser ben rhodes said . 
   __________________________________________  on the sidelines of the climate discussions , obama expressed to putin his regret over the death of the russian pilot , rhodes said , while emphasizing de-escalation with turkey . 
   ______________________________________  obama plans to hold a meeting tuesday morning with erdogan where he will again encourage de-escalation between russia and turkey , rhodes said . 
   ________________________________________  obama and putin also discussed the need for cooperation between the united states , russia , turkey and other countries to resolve the syria crisis , rhodes said . 
   __________________________________________  during the discussion , the american president also emphasized a diplomatic solution to the ukraine crisis , adding that sanctions against russia can be rolled back when moscow honours the minsk cease-fire accord , according to the white house official . 
   the two leaders met for 30 minutes alongside the climate talks in paris , the kremlin said separately . 
  hence why i said when talking about * currencies * . 
  well , to be fair , as far as discussions about currencies go , the eurozone should be included in that list as well for all intents & purposes with it 's gdp of around $ 10.1 trillion , no matter how dysfunctional or disunited it might actually be . 
  * the ** euro ** will go from a * 37.4 % * to a * 30.93 % * share of the basket to make room for the yuan , for a * -6.47 % * drop in it 's overall share & a * -17.2 % * drop in it 's individual share , resulting in the largest overall share drop & the 2nd largest individual share loss . 
  it will have the 2nd largest overall share of the new basket . 
  * the ** pound sterling ** will go from a * 11.3 % * to a * 8.09 % * share of the basket to make room for the yuan , for a * -3.21 % * drop in it 's overall share & a * -28.4 % * drop in it 's individual share , resulting in the 2nd largest overall share loss & largest individual share lost . 
  it will have the smallest share of the new basket . 
  * the ** japanese yen ** will go from a * 9.4 % * to a * 8.33 % * share of the basket to make room for the yuan , for a * -1.07 % * drop in it 's overall share & a * -11.38 % * drop in it 's individual share , resulting in the third largest overall share lost & third largest individual share lost . 
  it will have the fourth largest share of the new basket . 
  * the ** u.s. dollar ** will go from a * 41.9 % * to a * 41.73 % * share of the basket to make room for the yuan , for a * -0.17 % * drop in it 's overall share & a * -0.4 % * drop in it 's individual share , resulting in the smallest overall share lost & smallest individual share lost . 
  it will have the largest overall share of the new basket . 
  * the ** renminbi yuan ** will have the third largest overall share of the new basket at around * 10.92 % * . 
  the size of the imf 's currency basket as of now appears to be around $ 285 billion , which is a little bit bigger than finland 's economy , about half the size of sweden 's economy , or about a quarter the size of mexico 's economy . 
  in overall national reserves , the united states dollar still makes up about 63.8 % of international holdings , the euro about 20.5 % of international holdings , the pound sterling about 4.7 % of international holdings , the japanese yen about 3.8 % of international holdings & the renminbi yuan about 2.9 % of international holdings . 
  in overall currency trading , the united states dollar makes up about 44.6 % of transactions , the euro about 28.3 % of transactions , the pound sterling about 7.9 % of transactions , the japanese yen about 2.7 % of transactions & the renminbi yuan at about 2.2 % of transactions . 
  and my apologies for reacting like that , i 'm sorry . 
  should 've been a little more reserved . 
  there is now . 
   however , all the tows we gave to moderates seem to have wound up with jan. ** jesus christ , what !?!? 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  ** go look up atgm on / r/syriancivilwar * right now * . 
  out of the * hundreds * and * hundreds * of videos , going back * months * and * months * , jan has only ever been able to get their hand on like ... a single tow ... and even then i 'm not sure about that ... get the hell out of here with that bullshit man . 
  i do n't even know how somebody can drop such a bold-faced lie or be so misinformed in the context of google & the absolutely huge online archive of syrian atgm strikes . 
  also , we apparently also trained a couple thousand rebels under the * `` new syrian army '' * , which has allied itself with the syrian democratic forces & been airlifted into daesh 's bacyard , where they 're fighting daesh now in american-supplied kit & calling in airstrikes . 
  there 's rumors that they 're the cia-led training program , as opposed to the dod-led one you 're referencing ... which from what i can tell ... is n't that surprising given this kinda thing being the cia 's * thing * ... 
  good point , especially in the context of ahmad shah massoud & the sunni awakening . 
  hell , you can even ask russia with akmad kadyrov . 
  but really , at it 's core , once again , you 're right . 
  anybody who you happen to disagree with should , without hesitation , be classified as a terrorist or daesh . 
  luckily though we have barrel-bombing , gas-attack assad with his trusty hezbollah sidekicks to go after those nasty terrorists which ... once again ... is * everybody else against him * ... 
  yeah , it helps . 
  ** the international nazi ss **, 
  no , really , that makes sense . 
  * everybody * is either daesh or regime . 
  really . 
  pretty simple & honest . 
  i 'm glad we got this out the way . 
  yep , and gaddafi was going to single-handily unite africa into a entity more integrated than the european union & topple the fiat system of international currency , forever crippling the united states , the third largest producer of gold & now the largest producer of oil . 
  and he would 've gotten away with it too , if it was n't for those darn frenchies & brits with their ... euros ... and pounds ... . 
  yeah , lol , stupid fucking yanks . 
  acting like a conflict like this is immensely complicated as opposed to some easily-explained grand conspiracy , or that the numerous groups involved represent a situation much different from some clear * `` black-and-white '' * narrative . 
  what are they going to do next , drop some historical , cultural & realpolitik context to go with the above ? 
  idiots . 
  luckily we have you here to blindly shit on a entire country in the most pretentious way possible without actually contributing much to the conversation . 
  lol, 
  i did n't make it or defend it . 
  than it 'd be complete bullshit . 
  lol you 'd just be boiling down a vastly complicated conflict with multiple sides to a black-and-white , grand conspiracy with one nation pulling all the strings , with absolutely no nuance or acknowledged context . 
  ** iraq ** - * krg/peshmerga * ** syria ** - * ypg/rojave * ** turkey ** - * pkk * ** iran ** - * pjak * it 's more complicated than that , especially with the hdp in turkey , but that 's the general gist of it . 
  you can curse here friend . 
  this is a safe place . 
  and only like half of us are children . 
  nah , they 're not . 
  lol, 
  not very nationalist ... yes ... but rather * regionalist * from what i 've seen ... 
  yeah , i mean , i see a lighthearted sarcastic comment once every blue moon from non-beligans ... but honestly the vast majority of belgian bashing i see is done by ... belgians ... 
  i would n't be suprised , given the amount of british users , if they 're afraid of turning this sub into / r/unitedkingdom2 ca n't really think of a reason for the others though , especially serbia & switzerland . 
  like i pointed out elsewhere , it 's in cooperation with african union peacekeepers , whom have a united nations mandate , to support the internationally-recognized somalia government against groups like al-qaeda . 
  if people are surprised by this , wait until they find out about the dead french soldiers . 
  a operation carried out with implicit united nations-approval , in cooperation with the au peacekeepers & in support of the somalian government , against groups like al-qaeda . 
  ya 'll are going to focus on us americunts , but not realize you have european countries like france just as deep in the shit there as us with soldiers being killed , or how even for * their * independent operations they need to outsource things like drone surveillance & air support to us since they lack the domestic capability . 
  they 're not ? 
  i just do n't get it . 
  why the fuck would russia not push the * `` 17 seconds is bullshit '' * narrative alone ? 
  that was a good pr narrative to begin with & had some truth to it . 
  yet they chose to double-down on the * `` we never got a warning , we never touched their airspace '' * bullshit , even though the warnings were broadcasted widely on open channels & it involves a border that every major intelligence agency worth half-a-damn is monitoring . 
   nukes , lol not that i agree with the other guy , but you 're not exactly helping your argument . 
   but what are the chances that russia gave untrained rebels an incomplete anti air missile ? 
  who said it was incomplete ?
