  france never left nato itself through & had secret treaties in order to immediately rejoin the command structure should hostilities with the soviets broke out . 
  plus , france rejoined nato 's command structure back in the mid-or-late 2000s anyway .

  yeah , i always found * ` fam ' * to be a little annoying bruh . 
  this is actually a little surprising since france still * really , really * hates assad for some reason . 
  like ... * a lot more * than us . 
  from what i can tell , the entire reason they did n't join sooner was because they were still pretty god damned pissed at us for not going through with bombing assad back a couple years ago when we agreed to that arms deal with assad to strip him off chemical weapons . 
  i 've heard they 've been boycotting joining since , unless the airstrikes were expanded to include goverment targets , while cooperating with israel & saudi arabia to try & make it happen . 
  but i guess this signals they either unilaterally decided to join despite us not targeting assad , or we 've been able to convince them to give that condition up . 
  than again , nothing is concrete yet either . 
  well , we do have around 10 + million mostly mexican immigrants * ( in a country much smaller than europe population-wise ) * trying to escape from poverty & cartel violence so ... you know ... there 's that ... 
  meh , trade * surplus * , eh , my mistake . 
  it 'd be pretty cool if it was man . 
  lol, 
  i 'm not saying the end is nigh . 
  but the whole * `` haha y u jealous of our exports ?

  fucking told you !,

  ** [ ** u.s. blasts germany 's economic policies ** ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052702304527504579168113091545256 ) - * october 31 , 2013 *  employing unusually sharp language , the u.s. on wednesday openly criticized germany 's economic policies and blamed the euro-zone powerhouse for dragging down its neighbors and the rest of the global economy . 
   in its semiannual currency report , the treasury department identified germany 's export-led growth model as a major factor responsible for the 17-nation currency bloc 's weak recovery . 
  the u.s. identified germany ahead of its traditional target , china , and the most-recent perceived problem country , japan , in the * `` key findings '' * section of the report . 
   ----------------------------------------------------  the complaints about germany 's economic model aired in the report are well-known and have been conveyed quietly by u.s. officials over the years . 
  the latest venue for the comments were unusual , however , in a report that typically focuses on currencies rather than broader economic policies . 
   --------------------------------------------------  as germany helps define economic policy for the rest of the euro zone , washington wants to ensure the euro zone does n't rely too heavily on exports -- rather than domestic demand -- to pull itself out of its economic doldrums . 
   the obama administration heightened its criticism of germany markedly from april , when the last currency report was released . 
  at the time , the treasury broadly noted that germany and the netherlands maintained large trade surpluses and briefly mentioned a shortfall in demand within europe . 
  now , the treasury pointedly noted that germany 's surplus now exceeds china 's .

   responding to a pointed critique of berlin 's economic course by the u.s. treasury , german officials said the global appetite for german cars and machinery was driven by market factors and nothing else . 
   * `` the trade surpluses reflect the strong competitiveness of the german economy and the international demand for quality products from germany , '' * the economics ministry said . 
  [ ** u.s.

   treasury secretary jacob lew , visiting berlin , urged the german government to do more to boost lackluster domestic demand , which the u.s. and others argue is partly to blame for the anemic economic growth in the euro zone as a whole . 
   * `` policies to promote more domestic investment and demand would be good for the german economy and for the global economy , '' * mr. lew told a news conference . 
  [ ** u.s. scolds korea , germany as dollar rise spurs imbalances ** ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-09/u-s-criticizes-south-korea-for-intervening-to-resist-won-s-rise ) - * april 9 , 2015 *  the u.s. treasury criticized south korea 's currency intervention and germany 's widening trade surplus in a report that called global growth unbalanced and too reliant on the strength of the american economy . 
   ---------------------------------------------  the report also singled out europe 's biggest economy , saying * `` stronger demand growth in germany is absolutely essential , as it has been persistently weak . '' * policy makers in the euro area need to use fiscal policies to complement the monetary stimulus that the european central bank is providing , the report said . 
  [ ** eurozone economic growth slows ; gdp in euro area eased to 0.3 % in the second quarter , missing expectations ** ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/french-economic-growth-stagnates-1439530420 ) - * august 14 , 2015 *  *** frankfurt *** -- the eurozone 's modest economic recovery suffered a setback last quarter as france stagnated and germany posted a tepid expansion , underscoring deep-rooted fragility in the region that could threaten the global recovery . 
   the growth rate in the eurozone -- the world 's second-largest economic region , after the u. s. -- remained insufficient to boost inflation . 
  consumer price inflation grew just 0.2 % in july on an annual basis , eurostat said friday , far below the ecb 's target of just under 2 % . 
  [ ** eurozone unemployment drops to 10.9 percent ** ] ( http://www.sltrib.com/home/2899728-155/eurozone-unemployment-drops-to-109-percent ) - * september 1 , 2015 *  unemployment in the 19-country eurozone fell to 10.9 percent in july from 11.1 percent in june . 
   --------------------------------------------  the rate , however , remains at an uncomfortably high level for the currency union , with 17.5 million people out of work . 
  [ ** u.s. second-quarter gdp growth revised sharply higher to 3.7 percent ** ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/27/us-usa-economy-iduskcn0qw1if20150827 ) - * august 27 , 2015 *  the u.s. economy grew faster than initially thought in the second quarter on solid domestic demand , showing fairly strong momentum that could still allow the federal reserve to hike interest rates this year . 
   gross domestic product expanded at a 3.7 percent annual pace instead of the 2.3 percent rate reported last month , the commerce department said on thursday in its second gdp estimate for the april-june period . 
   the gdp report , which was released in the wake of a global stock market sell-off , should assure investors and cautious fed officials that the united states is in good shape to weather the growing strains in the world economy . 
  [ ** u.s. unemployment rate hits 5.1 % , lowest in 7 years ** ] ( http://abc11.com/business/us-unemployment-hits-7-year-low/969821/ ) - * september 4 , 2015 *  *** washington *** -- the u.s. unemployment rate fell to a seven-year low in august as employers added a modest 173,000 jobs , a key piece of evidence for the federal reserve in deciding whether to raise interest rates from record lows later this month . 
   the labor department says the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent from 5.3 percent , the lowest since april 2008 . 
   --------------------------------------------------  there are other signs that the u.s. job market remains solid . 
  americans overall have a brighter outlook : according to the conference board 's consumer confidence survey , nearly 22 percent of americans said jobs were plentiful in august . 
  that matched the proportion who said jobs were hard to get - the first time since the great recession began in 2007 that the two figures have been equal . 
  also , if somebody wants to fix the middle east , they need to go in there , with ground forces , and occupy for a good twenty years , and not bow to public pressure , from either side of the aisle , and leave after only ten . 
  that means dealing with dead soldiers from ieds and dead civilians because of collateral damage * ( within reason ) * without any of the bullshit . 
  spending all that money without any complaints . 
  no * `` yankee go home !, 
  '' * or * `` imperialist western bastards get out of the middle east !, 
  '' * , because if somebody does n't do that , than this cycle is just going to continue . 
  but i mean , i get it , while dictators cause religious extremists , they 're also the most effective at containing them . 
  which leaves us at a catch-22 . 
  if we do n't prop them up without committing to a long-term occupation , we get something like isis or the iranian mullahs , but if we do prop them up , we chance getting something like saddam , a genocidal dickhead who invaded most of his neighbors at one time or another , is the root cause for much of the underlying religious extremism in the first place & will probably end up forcing our hand anyway one way or another . 
  so , we 're left at a precipice . 
  do we put lives on the line & throw money down the hole , for a full twenty-something years , or do we put no lives on the line & go with a bargain price dictator , even though he 'll probably be overthrown or bite our hand in twenty years , forcing us to intervene or replace him again ? 
  and not to mention the very high likelihood of extremists never going away in this scenario ... just remaining constant in what seems like a never-ending cycle ... 
  i 've always been of the opinion that the greatest culprits for this type of extremism is the dictators themselves * ( which one could trace back to possibly being a necessity after sykes-pikot & decolonization if they want ) * . 
  whether talking about dictators we 've supported or opposed , put in power or dethroned , these type of extremists always follow in their wake . 
  from iran , to iraq , to syria . 
  when you oppress a population politically & socially , and make it so their only real means of opposition is through religious groups , than yes , of course , you 're going to get extremists because that becomes the people 's only real legitimate & permitted social outlet * ( nor can you exactly try & squash out religion itself , as that tends to backfire in much the same way , as evidenced by the soviets & afghanistan ) * . 
  egypt is the perfect example of this . 
  when we supported egypt under mubarak because of the suez canal & peace with israel , we were condemned by everyone for propping up a authoritarian dictator . 
  when we opposed sissi because the muslim brotherhood had won the election democratically & peacefully , we were condemned by everyone for supporting religious extremists . 
  when russia went & made overtures to sissi is regards to the above , putin was called a master chessplayer who 's wisdom knows no bounds . 
  when we reacted by laying off sisi & unfreezing that aid money so as to off-set that growing russian influence , we were condemned as bastard dog imperialists propping up a authoritarian dictator . 
  no matter what we do , we 're in the wrong . 
  the public , and reddit , does n't even know what they fuck they want , or truly oppose , for the matter as well . 
  and , just for the record , when we left iraq , al-qaeda & groups like it had been either successfully suppressed & widdled down to nuisance groups , thrown out or systematically destroyed . 
  it 's not a coincidence that isis had to infiltrate & attack from syria , instead of the opposite . 
  i do find it odd that no blame is placed on iran & maliki as well by your implications . 
  the iranian-backed militias who supported maliki single-handily burned every fucking bridge we forged & alliance we made with the sunni awakening after the troop surge . 
  and not only that , he also managed to fuck up every relationship the country had with surrounding sunni countries while doing everything in his power to make sure it was untenable for us to maintain a presence . 
  but no , personally fueling sectarian warfare in your own country at the behest of a foreign one , betraying the sunni tribes which helped you push these type of extremists out , pissing over every one of your sunni neighbors , while letting your shia neighbor train & arm shia militias in your own country , and not to mention moving to kick out the one country which had made stability after saddam 's fall possible was a * great course of action * that puts no huge amount of fault on maliki & iran 's shoulders what-so-ever . 
  haha how are we brushing it under the rug again ? 
  because you still used it as a excuse to comment on racial relations ... * like the type of excuse a racist gives * ... 
  but you know i 'm just fucking with you on this & not being serious , so can you ** please ** answer this ? 
   and back to that point ... where the fuck was i racist or even said something that implied racism ? 
  like ... why the fuck would you call me a racist ? 
  lol who the fuck are you and where do you get off doing that shit when you do n't have a single fucking thing to back your bullshit up ? 
  what you just said . 
  it 's always something like * `` oh , i 've been to brooklyn which has a lot of black people , so i can comment on race '' * , when it 's really just something racists say to excuse their racist-ass comments . 
  you know , like when i mentioned i grew up with half-the-people i knew being black , and you automatically painted me as a racist ? 
  lol and back to that point ... ** where the fuck was i racist or even said something that * implied * racism ? 
  so , what the fuck does that have anything to do with this ? 
  that type of shit is just a typical escape tactic of racists to insist that since they 've lived somewhere with a lot of black people , they * `` ca n't possibly be racist '' * . 
  how so ? 
  did censorship help during * the troubles * ? 
  wha - ... what did i say that was racist ?
