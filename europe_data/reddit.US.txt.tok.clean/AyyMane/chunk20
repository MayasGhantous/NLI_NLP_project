  and i 'm sure if they gave equipment they 'd give some hobbled-together & accelerated training , if not straight-up supervision & some advisers . 
  but , even in the context of that , if russia did do it , i mean , what would happen ? 
  them shooting down a airliner after misidentifying it in a frenzied state ? 
  turkey has the most powerful military in the middle east , the largest economy in the middle east , a clear national identity & a competent intelligence service . 
  it can shut down the bosporus strait , cutting russia off from the mediterranean , & probably flood the caucuses with soldiers & military equipment , creating a fortified choke-point right on russia 's border , in addition to likely bolstering countries like georgia and stirring shit in chechnya . 
  also , just like russia can strike * from * the black & caspian seas , turkey can strike * into * the black & caspian seas , and i would wager could also defend it 's airspace well enough to cause a good number of ruaf casualties . 
  oh , and it 's pretty much guaranteed that assad is gone and the russian military has been ejected from syria in this scenario . 
  underestimate them at your own risk . 
  never said the ukrainian army is the best , i did n't even say they 're top-tier , i was just pointing out that they 've fought in heavy combat against the russian military before . 
  that shows both willingness & experience . 
  also , a conventional war would be bloody , but russia would win in the end . 
  holding onto western ukraine though ? 
  and ever being able to successfully extract themselves from such a unconventional clusterfuck once they dig in ? 
  lol parts of eastern ukraine has come at a cost , and it 's completely alienated ukraine from russia , but the cost of invading the rest of ukraine & the long-term result of a full-out occupation ? 
  while simultaneously getting drawn deeper & deeper into the syrian clusterfuck ? 
  good luck . 
  doe n't matter if ukraine is in nato or not , they 've got a independent military that 's relatively-equipped with the necessary armaments to do it & have killed a couple hundred russian soldiers in their country before over the course of the last year or so . 
  also on feburary 19th , 2014 the understanding and consensus was that crimea was apart of ukraine , and that was recognized by everybody , including russia . 
  what changed after that day ? 
  lol, 
  nato was n't the driving factor in this though at all . 
  the european union was , germany especially . 
  the united states did n't even really get involved until after the european union dropped the ball completely & became embroiled in in-fighting once shit hit the fan . 
  it 's as plausible as russia invading ukraine or turkey downing a russian jet . 
  hindsight is 20/20 . 
  it 's completely possible that ukraine could down a russian fighter in the future .

  lol, 
  yes , i will say , the european union did help ignite & encourage the protests when they threw their full diplomatic weight behind that conditional trade agreement , demanded the release of yulia tymoshenko & loudly condemned the ukrainian government 's policies . 
  but do n't sit here and bullshit like the protests were n't massively popular * ( especially in the context of the orange revolution ) * , that the ukrainian government did n't respond brutally in trying to put them down & that russian meddling in , and manipulation of , ukrainian affairs was n't aggressive as shit . 
  also , if you 're justifying russia for securing interests in it 's own backyard , and thus it 's * `` sphere of influence '' * , than the same logic should be expanded to include the european union , as ukraine is * also * in it 's * `` backyard '' * . 
  for france , it 's mainly about preserving francafrique . 
  for america , it 's mainly about counter-acting chinese influence . 
  in addition , not many people like religious extremists & instability in the first place , especially if it 's on their doorstep . 
  also , showing solidarity with the two aforementioned nations can gain you some favor which you can use in the future . 
  that also coincide , incidentally , with the aftermath of the orange revolution , lead-up to the 2010 election & course of the war in eastern ukraine . 
   they did n't . 
  * [ ** russia cuts off gas to ukraine ** ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/russia-cuts-off-gas-to-ukraine/article700947/ ) - *** january 2nd , 2006 *** * [ ** russia cuts off gas deliveries to ukraine ** ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/02/world/europe/02gazprom.html?_r=0 ) - *** january 1st , 2009 *** * [ ** russia cuts natural gas supply to ukraine ** ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/06/16/russia-rejects-ukraine-gas-deal/10568467/ ) - *** june 17th , 2014 *** * [ ** russia 's gazprom halts ukraine gas supplies ** ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/russias-gazprom-halts-ukraine-gas-081331383.html ) - *** november 25th , 2015 ***  / r/conspiracy now , let 's be fair , i did n't say the jews had america order ukranian nazis to do it in support of daesh . 
  but , seriously , what are the chances that a advanced russian mobile sam system getting stolen from a heavily-guarded military base , snuck over the border , operated without a hitch by rebels with no known experience on it , and then snuck back over the border before anybody noticed what happened ? 
  ** edit : ** and to respond to the ninja edit about motive & evidence , the motive was to deny the ukrainian airforce air superiority & the primary evidence was shipped backed across the border , but the rebels tweeted about the incident right before , and the overall investigation * ( even after the crash-site was mishandled the way it was initially ) * confirmed it was buk which shot the airliner down . 
  yeah , except for the fact it was the european union which pushed that conditional trade agreement so hard in the first place & was the one of the most adamant about consistently condemning the ukrainian government over it 's policies , which both helped ignite & encourage the protesters . 
  i mean , you 're completely ignoring how popular the protests were , how brutal the ukrainian government was in trying to squash them , the incarceration of yulia tymoshenko or just how deep aggressive russian meddling went when it came to the ukraine . 
  i mean , is it really that hard to see why the euromaiden revolution would of enjoyed popular support , especially in the context of the orange revolution ? 
  eh , not really . 
  i 'm neither calling for the nuking of turkey , demanding the global isolation of ukraine , or foaming out the mouth about wwiii being imminent . 
  i just bolded a sentence . 
  people on other subreddits are losing their shit over this , calling ukrainians warmongerers & saying it does n't belong in europe/the western world , making it like russia is being bullied here . 
  but russia has annexed crimea , fueled a separatist war in eastern ukraine & shut off natural gas to ukraine whenever it felt like it , depriving ukrainian civilians of life necessities . 
  ** if anybody 's justified in this , it 's the ukrainians . 
  ** especially in the context of mh17 , when russia basically oversaw the shooting down of a packed civilian airliner over ukrainian airspace with no warning given what-so-ever . 
  not to mention ... you know ... other ukrainian military planes shot down by russia , both directly & indirectly . 
  at least in turkey 's example , they actually shot down a fighter jet , carrying two military personnel , which * was * warned & * did * violate turkish airspace . 
  a overreaction , yes , but still legal & justifiable , especially given past russian violations of turkish airspace and the two country 's spate over the bombing of syrian turkmen rebels near the border . 
  this is n't ukraine over-reacting , this is actually rather mild in comparison to russian actions over the past year or two . 
  the kurdish/assyrian daesh . 
  or the turkmen & sunni arabs who , in close cooperation with the above , are cutting a steady , deep hole right through daesh territory at a pace the saa with russian air support could only hope to achieve . 
  can you show me something comparable to the southern front , new syrian army & syrian democratic forces in saudi arabia ? 
  lol, 
  * dear citizens , * i like your idea , but i like the idea of actually being able to provide cheap energy & not suffer from a oil embargo like in the 1970s more . 
  nor do i like the idea of losing one of our most important vestiges influence in the region . 
  also , have you seen the guys who would replace the monarchy ? 
  * yours truly , * * every western government * * p.s. 
  * if you have a magical solution to stop the world from being dependent on oil overnight , retain a comparable level of influence in the region without saudi arabia as a ally & know a way to succeed with a western-backed initiative to change the muslim holy land 's government without it completely backfiring , than i am all ears . 
  cheers . 
  the legacy of european colonialism , authoritarian dictators , a sectarian proxy war , a world-wide dependence on oil , a crippling regional drought , the arab spring & erodogen 's populism ? 
  or did you think you were edgy enough to boil it all down to 2003 ? 
  in context of saddam ? 
  i mean , the pinnacle of stability that guy , if only after he seized power in a bloody coup , installed a kleptocratic sunni oligarchy , undertook a couple genocides , committed mass-murder against shia civilians & invaded pretty much all of his neighbors . 
  yeah , we went in on some bullshit , and we fucked up with bremer , but by the end , with the sunni awakening & troop surge , we had also managed to establish a inclusive government that had managed to relatively contain the insurgency and basically fractured al-qaeda to the point that large chunks had to flee to syria . 
  in addition to blaming us , you should read up on maliki & the antics of the iranian-backed militias which propped him up , or the militant rat-lines that assad supported for damn near a decade into iraq so he could wage a proxy was against us , the same rat-lines that allowed al-qaeda to establish a support network & supplylines through-out his country . 
  let 's put it this way . 
  the arab spring would 've happened with or without saddam , and if you think arms supplied by the united states to other rebels * ( including kurdish groups ) * which ended up in daesh 's arms is what gave them real fangs , than you have n't paid any attention to them or the conflict in general . 
  lol because you do n't seem to understand just how small of a fraction that really is in context . 
  and if you 're blaming kurdish groups for loosing weapons to daesh * in combat * , or that they never should 've been supplied in the first place , than i could n't really care much for what you say at all . 
  lol but really , i mean shit , if we 're talking about who armed who in this sense , than assad & maliki have been the biggest suppliers of daesh . 
  probably our support for israel * ( who started that again ? 
  ) * , the after-effects of colonialism , our close ties with saudi arabia * ( western boots in the holy land is not as attractive a idea as you might think it is ) * . 
  domestically their most motivating factors are likely the authoritarian dictators & iranian-backed militias which probably had the biggest effect on their respective populations for the longest period . 
  the occupation definitely had a effect , especially in the context of things like de-baathification & collateral damage , but it also led to shit like the sunni awakening at the same time . 
  in addition , this shit has been going on for * generations * across * the region * , not just since 2003 & in iraq . 
   well maybe the us did a lousy job regarding it 's interests in oil , but their presence was real : oh , without a doubt . 
  you got to keep context in mind though . 
  that was immediately after the oil embargo , which brought the entire western economy to it 's knees really , and what was basically a declaration of economic war . 
  carter appeared on national television in a * sweater * to try and encourage americans to turn down their heat to save costs , and there were lines around the block for gas stations . 
  i mean , that 's ** jimmy carter ** saying that . 
  the dove president of doves . 
  the very opposite of a war-hawk . 
  if that does n't drive the point home , than i do n't know what will , and i doubt many europeans who were around during the embargo would 've disagreed with that sentiment at the time . 
  the intelligent approach would be a region-wide large-scale long-term occupation of syria & iraq * ( and anywhere else for that matter ) * by russia , china & the west with threats of embargo against iran , turkey , pakistan & the gulf states for continuing to fuel their proxy war . 
  but the west either hates or is already exhausted from occupations & nation-building , russia & china both have issues with either the west or america thanks to ukraine & the south china sea , russia needs iran , pakistan is nuclear with both china needing them for the same reason russia needs iran & america needing them because of afghanistan , everybody in nato needs turkey and * everybody-in-general * needs oil from the gulf states . 
  if you have a intelligent approach , compared to all these dumb * `` easy '' * approaches , than i 'm all ears . 
  lol oh , and do n't forget to throw in nuclear-armed israel , ever-growing kurdish independence movement , a shaky libya & a egypt which might one-day see a * arab spring 2.0 * given sissi 's coup . 
  are you going to go back-a-century to reverse sykes-pikot ? 
  save the ottoman empire ? 
  abolish russia & britain 's great game ? 
  prevent any authoritarian dictator from ever seizing power in the region ? 
  get the world off oil so the region ca n't embargo us like they did in the 1970s , thrashing pretty much all of our respective economies ? 
  make that syrian drought non-existent ? 
  or are you foolish enough to think that everything went to shit in the middle east come 2003 ? 
  that sectarian , kleptocractic , nepotistic authoritarian dictators , one of which committed two cases of genocide & invaded pretty much every one of his neighbors , share no responsibility in their country 's ultimate fate ?
