  lmao get a grip & stop the delusional bullshit . 
  there 's a reason that * `` peace in the middle east '' * was a joke for most the 20th century and not just the beginning of the 21st century . 
  there 's a reason that the * `` arab spring '' * was ever a thing . 
  idk , would germany be better if it was ran by bavarians or the united kingdom by the scottish ? 
  maybe , but would n't that still piss everybody else off & make a nation 's very foundation unstable ? 
  so many people act like this is a foreign dilemma they ca n't understand or something that happened far enough in the past that they can excuse themselves as having forgotten about it , but the balkan wars only cooled off around the turn of the millennium . 
  and our justification in syria is daesh & to help our local allies . 
  nobody was bitching when we helped stop kobani from being slaughtered , and nobody complained during the past couple weeks as the sdf cut a deep path straight through daesh territory . 
  other than that , eh , assad is getting a taste of his own medicine . 
  most europeans on the internet did n't have shit to say when syrian & iranian-backed militants blew american & iraqi soldiers to fucking pieces , so i do n't really care what they have to say now . 
  it was always * `` well , let 's ignore iran & syria 's actions , and other than that , it 's understandable , i mean they invaded '' * , so you know what ? 
  now most europeans on the internet should ignore us & be all understanding and shit about people rising up against a authoritarian mass-murdering dickhead . 
  lol as for the iraq war in itself , meh , it would 've been better if we went in on the excuse of saddam being a asshole than the bullshit we did , other than that i could really give two fucks about that genocidal dickhead 's overthrow . 
  my real complainants are paul bremer 's retarded de-bathification & us not trying to reel in maliki more . 
  an if it was over oil than we 're the most generous fucking country in the world given that european , russian & chinese corporations got almost all the contracts . 
  a little off-topic , but i ca n't help at laugh at the stereotypical hypocrisy on this subreddit from some germans . 
  ** on genocide ** * from europe : * never again !, 
  * to the middle east : * okay ... maybe once again if we just ignore it ... . ** on middle eastern immigrants ** * from europe : * it is racist , islamophobic & fascist not to accept as many middle eastern immigrants as we can & for us to not welcome their culture !, 
  these people deserve the values of tolerance & liberal democracy to be championed for them !, 
  * to the middle east : * these people need a brutal dictator to keep them in line !, 
  there 's no other way !, 
  the iron fist must come down !, 
  ** on uprisings ** * from europe : * it 's completely understandable why militants are fighting american & iraqi government soldiers during the occupation , especially after the theatrics of the initial invasion , i mean , it 's justifiable to a degree , is n't it ? 
  * to the middle east : * i do n't understand why so many syrians are fighting against their own authoritarian dictator who thrives on mass-murder , systematic torture & who 's entire ruling elite is grounded in ingrained minority sectarianism , nepotism & kleptocracy !, 
  it makes no sense !!, 
  well , to be fair , assad tolerated & even supported to a degree , militant ratlines into iraq for a entire decade while waging a proxy war against us . 
  this gave al-qaeda a established support network & presence through-out his country . 
  he attempted to control it , but the cat was already out the bag , and after the troop surge & sunni awakening , the insurgency had become relatively contained in iraq & al-qaeda was in a number of ways fractured , with large parts forced to flee to syria . 
  this is also when assad found out that blowback is a bitch . 
  and one could also trace the initial revolution & unrest in syria to assad being ... well ... a authoritarian dictator who ruled through sectarianism & neopotism in a modern-day kleptocracy ... not to mention the drought or sykes-pikot . 
  hence why daesh had to gather up strength in syria & * then * double-back into iraq . 
  which , one could also argue , was in large part possible because maliki thought it was a good idea to solidify his rule with iranian-backed militias , burn every god damn bridge we forged with the sunni awakening , begin persecuting sunni groups/individuals on a whim and alienate everyone of his sunni neighbors . 
  we got some blame * ( paul bremer & not pushing harder to maintain a invested presence in-country , even in the context of maliki 's demands that american soldiers be tried in iraqi courts ) * , but do n't sit here on some bullshit and boil it all down to * '' ` murica '' * . 
  because i can also boil it down to * `` yurop '' * over sykes-pikot , which helped enable said genocidal iraqi dictator who invaded most his neighbors in the first place . 
  there 's a lot of blame to go around and it 's not just on us . 
  this shit is a lot more complicated , a lot more nuanced and goes a lot deeper than you assume it does with the simple-minded , one-size-fits-all bullshit you sprout . 
  inside job, 
  i am kinda surprised , since every bnd activity is supervised by the nsa . 
  no we do n't . 
  lol cooperate heavily , yeah , but not supervise . 
  you would n't be able to spy on us if that was the case , not to mention the mass surveillance agreements your country has with other european nations independent of the nsa . 
  you ca n't for the life of you actually admit your government did a lot of this of it 's own accord & in it 's own interests , can you ? 
  even in the face of all the mounting evidence , it 's still that pretentious holier-than-thou innocent victim shtick , huh ? 
  except ... it is able ... and does so regularly ... hence why it tracks most the metadata of all foreign communications that pass through germany * ( like sweden ) * & the majority of the data the nsa got from germany was collected by ... the germans ... who then * handed * it over to us in exchange for * other information * & * better technology * . 
  and that 's not counting all the other tech & info sharing deals that germany has with a number of other european nations for * their * domestic mass surveillance programs . 
  do n't pull that mr. innocent victim , holier-than-thou bullshit , especially in * this * thread . 
  lol, 
   americans are a great example of this . 
  personally , i would 've went with the french , given how many times they 've been caught spying on us & german ceos having complained about them being worst than china & russia . 
  lol oh ... and actually ... you know ... i wonder how volkswagen managed to hide that carbon emission software so well in the united state now that we 're on this subject ... 
  well , let 's be fair , there 's also a chance they 're on german , swiss , swedish & italian servers , depending on whom & where you e-mail from or to , and possibly french ones too depending on how your mass surveillance laws are structured , and that 's not even mentioning the broad & integrated pan-european information sharing programs . 
  well , to be fair , germany & sweden store the same kinda data that the nsa does for any foreign information passing through their borders , and france , italy & switzerland all have their own mass surveillance programs too . 
  even though we were some of the ones who pushed hardest for it & were fundamental in it 's very creation . 
  ironic , no ? 
  lol, 
  well , shit , those chinese communists helped with that too if we 're being honest . 
   and , yeah , we did it after the soviets backed a coup which overthrew the nationalist/secular government whom advocated progressive policies , one we had good relations with for decades , murdered our ambassador , murdered the dude they helped put in power with the aforementioned coup to replace him with a direct puppet & then drove a whole army into there just to dickwave . 
  like , lol , wtf ? 
  what were you expecting us to do ? 
  we were tried so we tried the soviets back . 
  simple as that . 
  do n't try no shit , and there wo n't be no shit , because otherwise , we will implode your shit man & burn the whole god damn house down . 
  lol plus those contacts with the northern alliance proved useful when we had to intervene come 2001 . 
  and those guys are alright to a degree , at least in a relative sense to their alternatives . 
  and the afghan communists and soviets had more to do with the root causes of islamic extremism there than we did . 
  that 's what happens when , in around a * single year * , you manage to kill tens of thousands of political prisoners spread across the entire spectrum of society , dismantle the only credit system peasants have access too , implement one of the most incompetent land reform programs ever attempted that benefits nobody and try to force atheism on a traditionally conservative islamic country-side . 
  oh , and then , * after that * , flood the country with a bunch of foreigners whom straight up take-over the government after killing the dude who invited them into the country , begin to bomb entire villages/cities to dust , thoroughly destroy the country 's agricultural infrastructure , directly kill around a quarter million citizens , which is marked by instances of large scale massacres involving hundreds of civilians at a time . 
  ** 1933-1977 : ** relatively secular , stable & possesses national foundation ; good relations with both major superpowers & advocates progressive policies ** 1978 : ** communist coup ** 1979 : ** full-blown revolution ** 1980 : ** complete soviet occupation like , lol , they managed to piss away half-a-century of solid progress in three years & ignite a insurgency which has n't stopped until this day . 
  not to mention the huge amount of central americans which go through mexico to get to america . 
  mexico is now deporting more people than we are iirc . 
  lol, 
  for what ? 
  ya 'll the ones which drew all those genius borders with shit like sykes-pikot , started the great game with your colonial empires & helped us throw fuel on the fire afterwards . 
  also , you forgot to thank the united nations , since the invasion & occupation was specifically authorized by them . 
  what fucking revolution ? 
  lol it was a foreign-backed armed coup . 
  and the monarchy was already gone by this time after * it * was replaced in a bloodless coup by the king 's cousin & the country 's prime minister , who established a relatively nationalist regime under the notion of a republic which advocated secularism & progressive measures , as well as having actually successful economic initiatives . 
  and it 's * afghanistan * . 
  the people did n't want the communists , but at least they could tolerate the monarchy & nationalists . 
  the monarchy & nationalists just really enforced it 's rule heavy-handed in the urban centres * ( which were relatively secular & western-influenced ) * , leaving the country-side to itself . 
  hence those pretty pictures you see . 
  the communists started to immediately kick down doors , disappear people in the night to be tortured & murdered , and then started confiscating land willy-nilly . 
  everybody rising up & going ape-shit over that is what caused the real * `` revolution '' * . 
  and , it is literally , all on wikipedia [ ** saur revolution ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saur_revolution#communist_rule )  it prohibited usury , without having in place any alternative for peasants who relied on the traditional , if exploitative , credit system in the countryside . 
  that led to an agricultural crisis and a fall in agricultural production . 
  land reform was criticized by one journalist as * `` confiscating land in a haphazard manner that enraged everyone , benefited no one , and reduced food production , '' * and * `` first instance of organized , nationwide repression in afghanistan 's modern history . 
  '' *  once in power , the pdpa implemented a socialist agenda . 
  it changed the national flag from traditional islamic green color to a near-copy of the red flag of the soviet union , a provocative affront to the people of this conservative islamic country . 
   ______________________________  the revolution also introduced severe repression . 
  according to journalist robert kaplan , while afghanistan had historically been extremely poor and underdeveloped , it * `` had never known very much political repression '' * until 1978 . 
    the soldiers ' knock on the door in the middle of the night , so common in many arab and african countries , was little known in afghanistan , where a central government simply lacked the power to enforce its will outside of kabul . 
    taraki 's coup changed all that . 
  between april 1978 and the soviet invasion of december 1979 , afghan communists executed 27,000 political prisoners at the sprawling pul-i-charki prison six miles east of kabul ... many of the victims were village mullahs and headmen who were obstructing the modernization and secularization of the intensely religious afghan countryside . 
  by western standards , this was a salutary idea in the abstract . 
  but it was carried out in such a violent way that it alarmed even the soviets ...  it was the saur revolution and its harsh land reform program , rather than the december 1979 soviet invasion * `` as most people in the west suppose '' * , that * `` ignited '' * the mujahidin revolt against the kabul authorities and prompted the refugee exodus to pakistan , according to kaplan . 
  [ ** soviet-afghan war ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93afghan_war )  vigorously suppressing any opposition from among the traditional muslim afghans , the government arrested thousands and executed as many of 27,000 political prisoners . 
  by april 1979 large parts of the country were in open rebellion and by december the government had lost control of territory outside of the cities . 
  in response to afghan government requests , the soviet government under leader leonid brezhnev first sent covert troops to advise and support the afghani government , but on december 24 , 1979 , began the first deployment of the 40th army . 
  arriving in the capital kabul , they staged a coup , killing the afghan president , and installing a rival afghan socialist * ( babrak karmal ) *  ______________________________________  soviets used their air power to deal harshly with the afghan rebels , leveling villages to deny safe haven to the enemy , destroying vital irrigation ditches , and laying millions of land mines . 
   __________________________________  decrees setting forth changes in marriage customs and land reform were not received well by a population deeply immersed in tradition and islam , particularly by the powerful land owners who were harmed economically by the abolition of usury * ( though usury is prohibited in islam ) * and the cancellation of farmers ' debts .
