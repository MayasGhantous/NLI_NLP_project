  by mid-1978 , a rebellion started with rebels attacking the local military garrison in the nuristan region of eastern afghanistan and soon civil war spread throughout the country . 
  in september 1979 , deputy prime minister hafizullah amin seized power , arresting and killing president taraki . 
  over two months of instability overwhelmed amin 's regime as he moved against his opponents in the pdpa and the growing rebellion . 
   _________________________________  on october 31 , 1979 soviet informants to the afghan armed forces who were under orders from the inner circle of advisors under soviet premier brezhnev , relayed information for them to undergo maintenance cycles for their tanks and other crucial equipment . 
  meanwhile , telecommunications links to areas outside of kabul were severed , isolating the capital . 
  with a deteriorating security situation , large numbers of soviet airborne forces joined stationed ground troops and began to land in kabul on december 25 . 
   ___________________________________  that operation began at 19:00 hr. , when the kgb-led soviet zenith group destroyed kabul 's communications hub , paralyzing afghan military command . 
  at 19:15 , the assault on tajbeg palace began ; as planned , president hafizullah amin was killed . 
  simultaneously , other objectives were occupied * ( e.g. , the ministry of interior at 19:15 ) * . 
  the operation was fully complete by the morning of december 28 , 1979 . 
   ________________________________  however , the presence of soviet troops did not have the desired effect of pacifying the country . 
  on the contrary , it exacerbated a nationalistic feeling , causing the rebellion to spread further  _________________________________  there have also been numerous reports of chemical weapons being used by soviet forces in afghanistan , often indiscriminately against civilians . 
  a declassified cia report from 1982 states that between 1979 and 1982 there were 43 separate chemical weapons attacks which caused more than 3000 deaths . 
  by early 1980 , attacks with chemical weapons were reported in * `` all areas with concentrated resistance activity '' *  _________________________________  r.j. rummel , an analyst of political killings , estimated that soviet forces were responsible for 250,000 democidal killings during the war and that the government of afghanistan was responsible for 178,000 democidal killings . 
  there were also a number of reports of large scale executions of hundreds of civilians by soviet and dra soldiers . 
   __________________________________  irrigation systems , crucial to agriculture in afghanistan 's arid climate , were destroyed by aerial bombing and strafing by soviet or government forces . 
  in the worst year of the war , 1985 , well over half of all the farmers who remained in afghanistan had their fields bombed , and over one quarter had their irrigation systems destroyed and their livestock shot by soviet or government troops , according to a survey conducted by swedish relief experts  the population of afghanistan 's second largest city , kandahar , was reduced from 200,000 before the war to no more than 25,000 inhabitants , following a months-long campaign of carpet bombing and bulldozing by the soviets and afghan communist soldiers in 1987 . 
  land mines had killed 25,000 afghans during the war and another 10 -- 15 million land mines , most planted by soviet and government forces , were left scattered throughout the countryside . 
  the international committee of the red cross estimated in 1994 that it would take 4,300 years to remove all the soviet land mines in afghanistan . 
   _______________________________  a 2005 report estimated 3 -- 4 % of the afghan population were disabled due to soviet and government land mines . 
   _________________________________  critics of soviet and afghan government forces describe their effect on afghan culture as working in three stages : first , the center of customary afghan culture , islam , was pushed aside ; second , soviet patterns of life , especially amongst the young , were imported ; third , shared afghan cultural characteristics were destroyed by the emphasis on so-called nationalities , with the outcome that the country was split into different ethnic groups , with no language , religion , or culture in common ** 1978 ** - * coup * ** 1979 ** - * full-blown revolution * ** 1980 ** - * complete soviet occupation * in the manner of a couple years , decades of stability & good relations with both superpowers were reversed . 
  a incompetent communist government was followed by a even more incompetent soviet occupation . 
  anybody who lauds this shit while condemning us in afghanistan & iraq in the same breath is a idiot . 
  lol, 
   did you know that american policy created dash and isis ? 
  yeah , we helped with it 's creation thanks to bremer 's bullshit , but where did al-qaeda & isis go after the troop surge & sunni awakening ? 
  when we managed to eject them from the country & contain , relatively speaking , the overall insurgency ? 
  ** syria ** hence why isis had to gain strength there , and then * double-back * to infiltrate iraq . 
  which should n't come as a surprise , given that assad was , as i pointed out , training , sheltering & funding these types of groups to fight a proxy war with us . 
  and when maliki 's government managed to destroy every bridge we made with the sunni awakening , throw more fuel on the sectarian conflict with persecutions of sunnis & trashed every relationship he had with neighboring sunni countries , thus giving isis the perfect opportunity for a re-surgence in iraq , who was he propped up by ? 
  ** iran ** yeah , we got our fair share of blame , but saying we have all the blame , and are the sole reason for isis ' rise , especially in the context of syria & iran , is fucking outrageous . 
  lol  was the war in afghanistan really about finding one man , and his small group ? 
  pretty heavy price to pay for that . 
  then again , bin laden was a powerful guy . 
  never mind usa refused an offer from the taliban government to take him just a while before 9/11 . 
  it about sending a message , and , as a bonus , getting a foothold in central asia . 
  it was authorized by the united nations , was it not ? 
  al-qaeda was based out of afghanistan , were they not ? 
  the taliban had continuously sheltered them , protected them & supported them for years & years , despite numerous other terrorist acts committed by them , did they not ? 
  and that offer was bullshit & you know it . 
  did you see the conditions tied to it & the type of relationship they had with osama ? 
  people are on america 's dick about assange & sweden , or snowden & russia , but that kind of doubt is n't applied to the fucking taliban & osama ? 
  given their relationship & bullshit * `` offers '' * ? 
  get the fuck out of here with that bullshit man . 
  lmao, 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  have you even actually * researched * any part of what you just said ? 
  afghanistan was relatively secular & had a good amount of western-influence for * decades * before that . 
  it 's governments advocated for progressive measures . 
  it had good relations with * both * america & russia . 
  you know when shit went downhill ? 
  after decades of relative stability & enclaves of secularism ? 
  ** when russia orchestrated a communist coup , which , in around a * year * , managed to kill * tens of thousands * of political prisoners and implement one of the most incompetent land reform programs ever attempted , igniting a nation-wide uprising . 
  ** for decades shit was cool , and in the matter of a year or two , a communist coup managed to piss * everybody * off , sharply divide the nation & cause a insurgency which has not ended to this day . 
  and when the communists that russia put in power asked for help ? 
  what did russia do to the president which invited them into the country ? 
  ** they murdered him , installed a direct puppet , and managed to alienate the very afghan communists they relied on for shit to work . 
  ** and , once the invasion started , how did russia handle things ? 
  how did russia respond to the situation after they just put in power one of the most incompetent administrations ever seen & then alienate that administration , which was really their only local allies on the ground in afghanistan ? 
  ** by bombing entire villages to dust , burning down entire forests & pretty much , thoroughly , destroying afghanistan 's agricultural infrastructure , in the context of the country 's agricultural output already being hit hard by the aforementioned land reform . 
  ** russia managed to upset decades of stability with a coup , alienate the very people they put in power with that coup and then completely piss off * everybody else * in the country with a incompetent counter-insurgency strategy . 
  read about that shit you sprout , because while shit might look pretty on paper , it 's good to look at how the shit actually came about , the context it came about in & what kind of effect it had in relation to the latter two things . 
  and those pretty little pictures of western-dressed women you see in kabul , surrounded by relative stability ? 
  ** that 's not from the communist era . 
  ** it 's from before it , when afghanistan , once again , had good relations with both the soviet union & america * ( which the soviets did n't much like , hence the coup ) * . 
  after the coup there was n't much time for that type of shit , as , relatively speaking , * immediately * after the coup everything pretty much imploded thanks to one misstep after another , by both the local communists & russians . 
  well , honestly , i think the first gulf war helped & set a pretty good precedent . 
  plus , afghanistan was authorized by a united nations security resolution & carried out under the context of nato 's article v . in addition , despite what you might 've heard , afghanistan under the taliban was neither a safe , stable nor nice place . 
  in addition , people love to bitch , but they never notice that their economy has n't been brought to a stand-still like it was in the 70s with the oil embargo or that oil flows freely & securely through the strait of hormuz without interruption . 
  they do n't remember that there has n't been a major war between israel & it 's neighbors for decades . 
  they do n't remember how european colonialism died , and nuclear war avoided , at the suez canal . 
  all the bad is brought to the fore-front , all the good swept under the rug , and then those same people talk about * `` balanced views '' * and * `` the importance of context '' * . 
  lol, 
  well , actually , technically speaking , it 's sanctioned by the united nations per a binding unsc resolution authorizing the invasion & resulting occupation . 
  it 's also nato-sanctioned as per article v. and ... ugh ... do ... do you remember afghanistan under the taliban ? 
  lol people want to bitch about the islamic state and then defend the maintenance of the same type of system in afghanistan like ... wtf ? 
  lol, 
  assad thought it was a good idea to shelter , train & support sunni extremist militants so he could wage a proxy war with america in iraq . 
  iran thought it was a good idea to shelter , train & support shiiite extremist militants so they could wage a proxy war with america in iraq and increase their hold on the country . 
  and now there are extremist sunni militants infesting syria & maliki 's iranian-backed government managed to completely alienate pretty much all of iraq 's sunni population . 
  you want to say it 's entirely our fault , and in part it is , but , lol , not entirely . 
  syria & iran are having their own chickens coming home to roost to prove that . 
  why ? 
  we did n't carve up the entire region in the most retarded way possible or start the great game . 
  you guys did . 
  nor were we the ones who advertised unlimited refugee capacity while misleading the entire third-world into thinking * everybody * from * everywhere * was welcome . 
  you guys did . 
  we just had to deal with the mess that came afterwards . 
  yeah , we 've thrown some fuel on the fire here & there , but you guys lit the match , and then helped us with the fuel . 
  that does n't mean we control it dipshit . 
  lol it just means we have more influence because a fellow anglosphere country & one of our closest allies is in it . 
  we do n't control the eu anymore than the french control the african union or canada , or the brazilians control portugal . 
  and if you think the above is nefarious or a grand conspiracy than you 're a fool who does n't understand that * every single country in the world * pulls that type of shit , and there 's nothing wrong with it in this circumstance . 
  but if you want to start condemning britain over this & accusing us of controlling the eu , than you better get on your knees and start thanking us for protecting & helping make happen both the eu & it 's predecessors , since all of that was done in the * pursuit of our interests * . 
  so , you know , you 're welcome . 
  lol,
