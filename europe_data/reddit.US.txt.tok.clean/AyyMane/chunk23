  but , in reality , that penetration-rate is probably somewhere like * 80 % * , if not higher . 
  and that 's a good two weeks * after * russian airstrikes began , and not counting ieds , vbieds , rpgs or units that 've been overrun with crews killed & equipment captured . 
  i mean , yeah , assad is making some gains under russian air cover , but the losses he 's taking are absolutely unsustainable , and the territory captured not that great in the context of them . 
  for instance , these are some of the worst armor losses that the saa has suffered * in the entire war * . 
  in addition :  ** around 80 aircraft in syria ** = ** around 300 sorties-a-day **  * russian aircraft like to travel in pairs  that means there are a estimated 24 aircraft in the air every hour , with 2 conducting attack runs or beginning their patrol , on average , every five minutes . 
  every aircraft , to make this work , may have to fly up to 4 sorties a day , with 3 sorties probably being the minimum . 
  that , above , is * absolutely insane * , especially in the context of russia 's maintenance woes that it 's only recently , in the past year or two , began to really try & fix , as well as the subpar infrastructure & conditions on the ground in syria which ar n't helping . 
  they 're going to have to slow it down or double-down if they want to maintain this tempo before russian planes start falling out of the sky from lack of maintenance & pilot fatigue . 
  heh , never heard of it . 
   thanks . 
  probably , but it 's also free . 
  so there 's that . 
  [ hola-unblocker ] ( https://hola.org/ ) is free too for the same thing * ( although it comes with it 's consequences , as explained below ) * . 
  gee whiz , i wonder why people do n't take my no-revenue/no-profit approach to making multi-million dollar entertainment that they wan na watch more seriously instead . 
  because we actually have guns . 
  we prefer to shoot people over drugs instead of sports & join gangs instead of soccer clubs when we wan na act like hooligans . 
  i think it depends on what the statistics say people prefer really . 
  subtitles are pretty much guaranteed , but they dubbed * ( according to the article ) * all the original content in italian here because of local preferences . 
  ** edit : ** also , if a dub already exists for licensed material , i do n't see why they could n't just throw it up as well . 
   netflix , the world 's largest network of internet tv is now available in italy . 
  the streaming platform premiered thursday in italy as netflix continued its tour across southern europe , launching tuesday in spain and wednesday in portugal , with a slew of original series stars in tow . 
   --------------------------------------------  subscribers across southern europe can sign up for $ 9 * ( $ 7.99 ) * a month for one sd connection , two simultaneous hd connections for $ 11.35 * ( $ 9.99 ) * a month and four simultaneous hd connections for $ 13.60 * ( $ 11.99 ) * a month . 
   netflix will be available across smart tvs , tablets , smartphones , game consoles and computers . 
  the company has also struck a deal with telecom italia to make netflix available on timvision . 
  vodafone is also offering several exclusive promotions that include netflix subscriptions . 
   ---------------------------------------------  while some series , such as * house of cards * , currently belong to sky atlantic in italy , netflix focused thursday on the original series it will be launching in italy , including * daredevil * , * marco polo * , * grace & frankie * , * unbreakable kimmy schmidt * and * narcos * . 
  content will also be available dubbed in italian , in accordance with local viewing preferences . 
   netflix 's first big foray into original italian content , * suburra * , will premiere in 2017 . 
  the 10-episode mafia drama explores the ever-popular local topics of politics , corruption , the vatican , drugs and prostitution on the roman coast . 
   the film * suburra * has proven to be a local hit since its theatrical release in italy on oct. 14 . 
  it 's currently available for streaming on netflix in the u.s. and in latin america and will be available on italian netflix in may of next year . 
   many italians have already voiced fear at slow bandwidth speeds to access premium content , especially outside of urban centers . 
  the company responded that the concerns in italy are overblown , and in any case a free month is on offer for everyone to try before they buy . 
  once again , by this logic , the european common market & nafta were protectionist measures . 
  in fact , ** every free trade agreement ever ** has been a protectionist measure unless participated in by ** every single country in the world ** . 
  do ... do you still not see the fault in your logic ? 
  ** no , no it 's not . 
  ** lol it is * literally * reducing tarriffs & harmonizing regulations between members to * ease trade * between members . 
  members are not raising tariffs and introducing more regulations against each other to * complicate trade * . 
  the latter is protectionism , the former is not . 
  otherwise it 's like calling drives to establish nafta or the european common market protectionist . 
  it makes no sense . 
  i mean , will china be mad that the west has solidified it 's standards & regulations on a global scale before it could ? 
  will it be mad that now it has to spend more money to meet higher standards , instead of playing divide & conquer to get it 's own personal , and lower , standards to become the global norm ? 
  of course . 
  ** but is this * ` protectionism ' * in the sense that you 're implying it ? 
  ** as far as * the agreement itself goes * , it 's streamlining trade & harmonizing regulations between the world 's two largest markets . 
  that 's going to increase trade & make the market more free no matter which way you cut it . 
  that fact that this has become your argument implies you 're now grasping for straws . 
   protectionist you say that word ... but i do n't think it means what you think it means in the context you 're implying it in ... 
  no , he probably actually supports it in regards to american national interests , especially in response to a rising china and fast-approaching multi-polar world . 
   ** tens of thousands of syrians have fled a government offensive on rebel-held areas south of the city of aleppo in the past three days , an activist says . 
  **  dr zaidoun al-zoabi , head of the union of syrian medical relief organisations , told the bbc that several villages he had visited were empty . 
   he saw thousands of people on the move , with no shelter or medical support . 
   ------------------------------------------------  dr zoabi told the bbc 's newsday programme that he had seen at least 70,000 people on the move in the countryside south of aleppo . 
   ---------------------------------------------  more than 11 million syrians have been driven from their homes since 2011 . 
  more than 4.18 million have fled abroad - 2.07 million of them to turkey - with growing numbers now making the dangerous journey to europe . 
   -----------------------------------------------  more than 250,000 syrians have been killed and a million injured . 
  ** like what ? 
  ** seriously , what * `` key food safety measures '' * is this website talking about ? 
  what ? 
  ** they do n't even fucking know what they 're bitching about you say !?!? 
  ** i swear , this reactionary populist shit is so annoying , it 's basically a emotional mob mentality of , * `` fuck americans , amirite guise ? '' * . 
  i mean , you wan na see the * entire basis * , in fact , the * only basis * this * entire article * is stretched out across ? 
  it 's cool , i 'll show you :  put forth by the uk-based social justice organization global justice now , the report ( pdf ) , published sunday , highlights a component of the pact known as * `` regulatory cooperation '' * or * `` regulatory coherence , '' * which seeks to establish common standards between the united states and the european union . 
  ** that 's it . 
  ** really , * that 's it * . 
  that 's the only god damn thing they have . 
  nothing in particular , just that . 
  you know , the * same fucking thing * the ttip has publicly & loudly declared about being * itself * . 
  fuck this website , fuck this propaganda , and fuck any idiot who is actually stupid enough or deceitful enough to trump this shit up like it 's a major discovery of super-secret classified information that * nobody * knew about or that * `` the man '' * was * scared * to tell us about . 
  fucking useful idiots . 
  the whole lot of them . 
  i swear . 
  the exact opposite actually . 
  i 'm confident that china will , pretty much without a doubt , surpass us in the future , and i 'm * alright * with that . 
  the only thing i disputed was that they 'd become the next all-dominating superpower , because i ca n't see * anybody * becoming a all-dominating superpower . 
  hence why i 've focused so much on the word ** multi-polar ** , as opposed to ** uni-polar ** . 
  even the chinese recognize that if they 're to be believed . 
  it seems to me that more people are upset that we wo n't implode like the soviet union or break-apart like the british empire , which makes no god damn sense , because the dynamic , both internationally & domestically with us , is * way different * than either of the above . 
  personally , i think people were * so set * on us going out like them , a colonial empire , overnight , and being forced into the same type of relationship with china like they now have with us , that they 're now really pissed off & confused , not knowing how to react , when it turns out we 're still going to be here , one of the most powerful countries in the world , and will always be respected at the big boys table , even if we 're not * the * superpower anymore . 
  i swear , this thread is full of people simultaneously being scared of china 's future rise , and still pissed about america 's past rise . 
  it 's like ... the perfect mix of insecurity and bitchiness ... lol, 
  what the fuck is that supposed to mean ? 
  lol this entire thread is filled with * other europeans * and * britons * bitching about china and it 's future rise , bitching about china 's human rights record of shit . 
  americans are all just kinda ... calm & cool , or at the very least , meh , about it ... 
  the fact you made that comment ... well ... it says more about you than us ... 
  no , i think if you can expand from 13 states to 50 states , from running a single coast to having a the entire expanse of a continent , and not lose them all overnight , and have them all integrated into a unified national institution , ** than you 're not a empire ** . 
  like i said , i never did like the whole * `` imperial '' * thing . 
  you tend to collapse over a long weekend and never stop bitching , or feeling insecure , about it . 
  there 's more europeans in this thread bitching about china & worried about them becoming the new superpower . 
  look through the thread . 
  lol you have british people crying about whoring themselves out , europeans worrying about what the new world order is going to look like , and americans basically being * `` meh '' * about it . 
  probably the british ... you act like they did n't have their hand in the cookie jar too ... 
  so are they probably . 
  lol, 
  * shhh ... * he 'll find us if you talk to loudly ... 
  well ... it is kinda . 
  no , superpowers left ... just competing great powers ... all trying to establish their own international system and carve out their own little spheres of influence ... we should rename the u.n. the thunderdome . 
  correct .
