  it turns out we did n't surpass * that * economically until about 1916 or so . 
  my apologies . 
  i personally prefer the term american hegemony . 
  never much did like the whole * `` imperial '' * thing to be honest . 
  the european union is already the same size as us economically . 
  you do n't need to * `` get your wealth back '' * , you just need to put it in one room and be satisfied with it . 
  unless we see another major break-up like with the british empire & the soviet union , there 's just going to be too many similarly-sized countries competing & wielding influence around for any one country to reign everything in or be able to keep a semi-form of order based around it 's general policies . 
  and even if * we do * see a major break-up , the most it would do is just buy us a little bit more time as superpower , possibly in a bi-polar world , until the other potential great powers finally get up into the same league . 
  you mean ... the one with alright growth that 's basically acting as the one reliable engine which the global economy is running on despite a shitty international showing of recessions in japan & russia , stagnant growth in europe and slowing growth in china ? 
  huh ? 
  lol you 'd kinda have to ignore history , present trends & the fact we 'll be in a competitive multi-polar world to come to that conclusion . 
  or ... are you comparing us to the soviet union & european colonial empires ? 
  because , i assure you , we will not lose new york like the dutch lost indonesia , florida like the british lost india or california like the soviet 's lost kazakhstan . 
  and if you do n't understand why the dynamic is different ... i just ca n't help you ... lol, 
  gdp ppp is good for measuring internal trade and the value of things domestically , but gdp nominal is what matters when talking about the value & influence your country has on international trade . 
  and you have to keep in mind , when talking about internal trade , that china has 4x our population . 
  and the soviet union had a inefficient economy , and that economy was outmatched by us , * but they were still able to achieve enough influence to compete with us internationally , in the same league as us , for half-a-century . 
  those god damned fools !, 
  what were they thinking !?!?

  nah , even a centralized eu would only be on our economic level today , and if ya 'll keep up with us into the future , china will eventually match you economically like they 'll eventually match us . 
  if the european union solidifies & serious integration happens with the united states , united as a allied bloc , the west would probably have a significant edge over china , now , at the end of this century , and beyond . 
  but divided ? 
  like i 've said elsewhere , i can see us & china still being in the same league by the end of this century * ( even after matching us economically decades before ... hell ... the soviets managed it for around half-a-century despite being dwarfed by us economically ) * , with china gaining a ever-increasing edge over us as the next century dragged on . 
  i do n't see us dropping out as being the number 2 guy even after that though ... 
  there will never be a superpower china . 
  only great power china . 
  there wo n't be any superpowers at all in fact after us . 
  ** welcome to a brave new multipolar world . 
  we surpassed the british economically somewhere around 1880-1900 . 
  they were still the most influential country for the next half-a-century . 
  china wo n't match us economically for around the next three decades or so . 
  we dwarfed the soviet union economically for it 's entire existance , but it still managed to trade punches with us and garner enough influence to get on the same level as us . 
  we 're not the british empire , our states wo n't all declare independence over a long-weekend . 
  we 're not the soviet union , the federal government wo n't disintegrate overnight . 
  we 'll still be here , one of the most influential countries in the world , the only one china will ever be able to look at as a equal . 
  and that will remain the case , even more than a century down the road , even after china surpasses us economically , even if they surpass us in influence * ( ala soviet union comparison ) * . 
  and vietnam did have a big effect on us . 
  we invaded to stop vietnam from becoming a communist puppet . 
  we left & communist china invaded them . 
  turns out , even communist vietnam is not a communist puppet . 
  now vietnam is becoming increasingly more capitalist and is one of the most pro-american countries in the world , it 's government is rushing to build military & economic ties with us , doubly-so in the context of a rising china . 
  funny how these kinda things work out . 
  lol, 
  lol no they 're not . 
  they 're just the future great powers . 
  there is going to be no superpower after us . 
  we 're heading into a multi-polar world . 
  the days of uni - or bi-polar international dynamics is over . 
  china is n't going to take two steps up , it 's going to take one step up & we 'll take one step down until we 're on the same level . 
  we 'll still be at the top . 
  india is a long-way off , but we 'll still be here . 
  first for the rest of this century , and still trading punches on a somewhat equal footing for as far as one can predict after that . 
  well , can you blame us ? 
  it 's the fucking * moon * . 
  would n't * you * want to own a part of it ? 
  i mean , we do n't even need to kill any natives to do it either . 
  lol it 's pretty much just sitting there ... waiting for a mcdonalds & walmart to be set-up on it ... 
  but on a optimistic note , antarctica has n't gotten too bad in comparison ... yet ... 
  as far as i 'm concerned , the moon is * our * property . 
  so it wo n't be a excuse , it 'll be a * declaration of war * . 
  * loads moon rifle , as guaranteed by the mooninite 2nd ammendment *, 
  * ** government launches domestic surveillance programs , willing hands over info to u.s. & allies in return for more info & technical help . 
  ** * ** government prohibited from trading with the u.s. , but maintains extensive domestic surveillance programs & continues to hand information over to various other european countries & other allies in return for more info & technical help ** * ** ???? 
  ** * ** you saves us from america !!!, 
  ** ya 'll are such cowards . 
  lol you could n't take responsibility for your own actions & culpability in them if it killed you . 
  and then you wonder why nobody takes what you say seriously on the international stage . 
  * hint : * it 's because you ca n't even take yourself seriously . 
  lol,

  i think we kinda got pissed back in the 70s when they unified , cut off oil to us & figuratively brought all of our respective economies to a grinding halt . 
  i think we kinda got pissed back in the 70s when they unified , cut off oil to us & figuratively brought all of our respective economies to a grinding halt . 
  oh , yeah , totally . 
  that 's why europe has such a amazing & competitive start-up scene compared to the united states . 
  lol, 
  yes , but that * `` drop '' * is made up of hundreds of research projects in many of the world 's most prestigious universities * ( mit , oxford , berkeley , harvard ) * and dozens of ph.d fellowships for many of the world 's brightest researchers in cutting edge technology * ( especially in regards to british & canadian researchers in a.i. 
  or american researchers in regards to robotics ) * . 
  they 're even cooperating in a serious fashion with [ nasa ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantum_artificial_intelligence_lab ) on quantum computer research . 
  hell , it was only last month that they announced that private lab in zurich & began funding hundreds of european a.i. 
  experts to begin research . 
  and that was on top of acquiring deepmind two years ago * ( which had no commercial products ) * and snatching up their 250 a.i. 
  experts so they could put them to work under google .
