  so , objectively , once again , how is google not a serious source of * `` science '' * again ? 
  lol, 
  ** they 're not threatening to fine google , they 're threatening to break it up . 
  ** the commission already tried to settle it with a fine like three time already , but european lobbyists & it 's corporate competitors have got it rejected every time & demanded it to be more & more severe , basically nothing less than a chop up . 
  ugh ... yeah ... but first off i was talking about past eu cases & settlements ... and second off comparing google to either of the east india companies ... which governed territory , taxed a population & fielded a private military ... almost two centuries ago ... is kinda retarded ... 
  well ... i mean ... it kinda is when you think about it ... 
  the way they 've adapted , organized & implemented a wide-range of ground-breaking technology on a massive global scale in a rather short time-frame is a achievement that speaks for itself . 
  and that 's not even mentioning their massive investments in future technology like robotics , artificial intelligence , self-driving cars & home automation . 
  you also have to acknowledge their venture capital arm , which has given billions in funding for risky technological start-ups . 
  what 's your argument for it not being a major source of * `` science '' * ? 
  lol what european corporation has been faced with what google is facing on the charges google is facing ? 
  which one has had multiple settlements agreed to by the commission turned down for not being harsh enough ? 
  and it 's great that you feel like that , but calling everybody a shill who does n't agree with you does n't mean shit really . 
  you 're just as likely to be a corporate european shill as i am to be a corporate american shill . 
  you realize a lot of them are funded in the first place by u.s. firms because european ones do n't want to take the risk on them , right ? 
  the punishment is basically * `` kill yourself '' * though . 
  lol and completely different than what they gave the last three guys for the last three same crimes . 
   also with it there would be room for european competitors . 
  no there wo n't . 
  lol it 'd just be another american competitor like microsoft . 
  europe does n't risk shit on start-ups & has n't tried to create something even close to the same foundation that the united states has done when it comes to encouraging them . 
  but it was n't always like that . 
  that 's relatively modern development . 
  they 're all mostly employed by recent companies who came from basically nothing , as dorm room & garage ideas . 
  so yeah , america built all that that , but it built it on a gamble with billions of dollars placed risky moves . 
  that was n't a given . 
  it was a choice . 
  and europe chose to be risk-adverse & not make gambles on tech like that . 
  and that attitude has persisted * to this day * . 
  but you want to criticize the united states for doing the ... opposite ... and building something like silicon valley ? 
  and reward europe for ... achieving ... what ... exactly in this regard ? 
  yeah , because americans decided to risk $ 41.5 billion more than europe in funding small start-ups & chance ideas there . 
  europe had the space & resources needed , just not willingness to risk a gamble on it . 
  * lol * the united states outspends europe by 70 % on r&d , by 450 % in venture investment & has close to 5x as many top-ranked universities than europe per capita . 
  what good is * `` space '' * if europe has n't committed to the universities needed to fill it , the money needed to fund it or risk needed to grow it ? 
  the original parliament resolution was proposed & sponsored by a german lawyer who was on the payroll of german publishers , and the result that resolution demanded * ( complete break-up of google ) * would be completely unprecedented & out-of-line with similar past anti-trust cases pursued by the european union . 
  the commission has attempted to settle three different times before with google , and each time european competitors & lobbyists prevented it & demanded more , and more extreme punishments . 
  the reality of this whole thing is that where we are now is because of protectionist lobbyists who ar n't even trying to get a fair judgement , they 're trying to basically destroy google & salt the earth around it . 
  no they 're not . 
  eh , a little . 
  by that logic , i should n't of had to include the south in the united states ' figures either . 
  i mean , you just ca n't include eastern europe in the schnegen area , single market , parliament , council & commission , but then pretend like they do n't exist & should n't be counted when you want shinier e.u. 
  numbers . 
  lol, 
  yeah , no shit . 
  lol and we 're just as ready to do the same to european corporations in response to that . 
  and that 's a view shared by both our [ executive ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/41d968d6-b5d2-11e4-b58d-00144feab7de.html#axzz4ev0v4svc ) & [ legislative ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3d903290-74c9-11e4-a418-00144feabdc0.html#axzz4ev0v4svc ) branches , across both party lines . 
  chop up what you want & do what you want . 
  just do n't bitch when the united states , which is much more integrated than the european union , spends a lot more on r&d than the european union , has much more high-ranking universities than the european union , invests more in tech start-ups than the european union , & has a larger overall tech sector than the european union , hits back & starts retaliating against european tech companies before they even know what 's happening . 
  we 're more prepared than you to * fight * a trade war over this & more prepared than you to * recover * from a trade war over this . 
  yeah , and i mean , they 'd basically be losing it anyway if their search engine is split from them , since they 'd no longer be able to use that revenue to fund all the other ventures that google is planning to diversify into & survive on in the future . 
  allowing a precedent like that to go unanswered would basically kill google as corporation in the long-term & cripple them beyond repair in the short-term . 
  yep , and in other news , internet piracy has also been utterly eradicated & internet proxies completely blocked . 
  and you fix that with privacy laws & regulations . 
  all of which google has abided by & complied with , from the eu 's * `` right to forget '' * law to germany 's privacy laws . 
  you do n't fix it by trying to basically cripple google as a corporation . 
  you only do that when you 're trying to destroy foreign competition on some protectionist bullshit . 
  and google as also been one of the most adamant about fighting government accessing that data with easy & has taken them to court over it . 
  it has abided by the eu 's * `` right to forget '' * laws & neutered a number of their services like streetview in germany to comply with local privacy laws there . 
  you might not care about * `` america vs eu tribalism '' * , but that 's the entire reasoning for this . 
  and congress should follow through on it 's threat to retaliate against european corporations as well if the eu follows through on this protectionist shit . 
  this ruling * ( splitting them up ) * would be completely unprecedented & nothing more than a predatory move to destroy google . 
  like i pointed out below ; europe does n't invest as much in r&d as us . 
  they do n't take as much risk with venture funding as us . 
  they do n't foster as many high-ranking universities as us . 
  they have n't grown their tech sector as much as us . 
  but they want to destroy the fruits of all that shit just because they did n't want to put in as much effort as us . 
  pathetic . 
  it would destroy them as a corporation & be completely unprecedented . 
  they 'd no longer be able to use any of their search revenue for robotics , space exploration , green energy , self-driving cars , home automation or gigabyte-fast internet . 
  and why ? 
  because europe does n't want to bite the bullet & invest more money ? 
  make it easier for venture capital to be invested ? 
  actually commit to the tech sector like america ? 
  *** annual research & development funding *** * ** united states ** - 2.7 % of gdp * ( $ 473.4 billion usd ) * * ** european union ** - 1.9 % of gdp * ( $ 334.3 billion usd ) * *** annual venture capital investment *** * ** united states ** - .28 % of gdp * ( $ 52.1 billion usd ) * * ** european union ( plus switzerland & norway ) ** - .06 % of gdp * ( $ 10.6 billion usd ) * *** top 100 universities *** * ** united states ** - 1 per 5.4 million people * ( 59 ) * * ** european union ( plus switzerland & norway ) ** - 1 per 25.4 million people * ( 20 ) * *** tech sector *** * ** united states ** - 7 % of gdp * ( $ 1.2 trillion usd ) * * ** european union ** - 5 % of gdp * ( $ 925 billion usd ) * europe does n't spend as much as us in r&d , it does n't take as many chances as us in venture investment , it does n't foster enough high-ranking universities to plant the seeds for revolutionary shit & it 's economy has n't transitioned into i.t. 
  as much as us , but than it wants to tear down shit like google because ... what ? 
  it did n't put in the work needed to really compete with them ? 
  why do n't you have your german flair anymore romek ? 
  and just how was it a shit-show again ? 
  lol it was worldwide , systematic fraud that reached to highest levels of vw & had infilitrated the entire market to it 's deepest level . 
  the only shitshow is the german/eu wrist slapping that 's being used against them as we speak . 
  i mean , do n't get me wrong , holy shit , i get it , a lot of germans have tried to replace stereotypical national pride & fervor with corporate pride & fervor for * `` german engineering '' * , so this whole thing must be traumatizing or some shit on many levels for a lot of people , but that 's still no excuse . 
  if the eu goes through with splitting them , it would be completely unprecedented & in stark contrast of every other anti-trust ruling they have ever made . 
  so , by your logic , * this * should 've never happened , and given that if it does happen , since it could completely cripple google as a corporation by precedent , i could very well see google responding like that . 
  for all intents & purposes , they would literally lose * all * their disposable european revenue if the eu follows through with this . 
  splitting the search engine away from google would deprive them of the revenue they use to invest * all * their other ventures , whether talking about robotics , self-driving cars , home automation , giga-byte rast internet & space exploration . 
  google has consistently re-affirmed the fact that they do n't want to be a search engine-centered corporation forever and they 're ultimate goal , and entire future , is to diversify with long-term plans over 20 + year periods . 
  in context , it might actually be a good idea for them to respond like that given their very survival would be on the line after the eu established a precedent like that . 
  and russia claims he was a masked man rushing the door . 
  yeah , it 's ppp , so it takes into account the prices of local services & products to bolster up the value to a extent iirc . 
  it 's ppp , not nominal , so it takes exchange rates & local pricing into account to some extent . 
  for example , hungary 's nominal gdp-per-capita is $ 12,240 , compared to the figure nearly twice that above in ppp terms . 
  so figures above would likely be worse than almost half if nominal & exchange rates were at the forefront of how they were calculated . 
  it 's actually ** income ** and ** median ** does n't work like that , only ** average ** does . 
  lol hence the difference you might notice in them . 
  median measures the very middle of the middle . 
  not really . 
  we have a higher [ ** gdp per capita ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) , [ ** average income ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_average_wage ) & [ ** median income ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income ) than the netherlands , the united kingdom , germany , france , japan , south korea , canada & new zealand . 
  i do n't know how that * `` median wealth '' * figure is calculated though . 
  here 's some : [ *** median income ( disposable in ppp , oecd placement ) *** ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=idd ) * ** united states ** - $ 30,616 * ( 4th place ) * * ** the netherlands ** - $ 26,440 * ( 12th place ) * * ** germany ** - $ 25,528 * ( 14th place ) * * ** france ** - $ 24,233 * ( 15th place ) * * ** united kingdom ** - $ 21,033 * ( 19th place ) * * ** italy ** - $ 20,085 * ( 20th place ) * * ** czech republic ** - $ 15,055 * ( 25th place ) * * ** poland ** - $ 13,248 * ( 28th place ) * * ** estonia ** - $ 11,947 * ( 30th place ) * * ** hungary ** - $ 11,927 * ( 31st place ) *,
