  also , for additional context , to be apart of the * `` 1 % '' * in america you need to make at least $ 450,000 . 
  to be fair though , the united states is n't doing too bad in that regard either compared to europe .

  and yet , it is the european union which is the one who had a double-dip recession , and is only * just now * starting to , ever-slowly , shrug off stagnant growth . 
  the united states , in comparison , managed to return itself to steady growth & recover all the ground it lost during the great recession in a couple years , as opposed to damn well a decade for europe . 
  problem is though , any additional competition is going to come from the united states , not europe . 
  the amount americans are willing to invest in high-risk , high-reward ventures completely dwarfs all of europe combined , and that 's without even mentioning the eu in itself * ( the uk leaving is n't going to help here ) * . 
  the european parliament can try to chop up google & apple & microsoft all they want , they can try to overregulate them in a protectionist reflex , but at the end of the day , another american start-up is just going to take their place . 
  do n't worry , i doubt europe has much to fear when it comes to american-style start-ups any time soon .

   the campaign allowed more than 14,000 guardian readers to send letters to voters in clark county ( * population 145,000 * ) who had not declared their party affiliation when they registered . 
  it was canceled less than 24 hours after the first letters arrived in ohio . 
   and on election day , clark was the only one of ohio 's 88 counties -- and among only 5 % of all 3,113 u.s. counties and independent townships -- to turn from democratic blue in 2000 to republican red this year . 
   ____________________  state republican officials reported a surge in call-ins and volunteers in clark county and across the state in the weeks that followed . 
  lol holy shit . 
  we must take a stand against foreign political influence by becoming foreign political influence . 
  honestly , i 'm not even sure if enough americans care about it to have a poll like that mean anything ... lol, 
  at least we 're not making illegal campaign donations & phone banking for the brexit like so many europeans did for bernie . 
  meh , let 's be real , a candidate like clinton , who supports free trade with the eu , strong nato commitments , is against the brexit , is for more european integration , is committed to not going too soft on russia & is open to using hard power more when it comes to shared western interests in the middle east/north africa is * exactly * what most influential european politicians want . 
  i mean , sure , you can say * `` but that 's not what the people want !, 
  '' * , but than i could just say , well , i guess it turns out you 're not very democratic after all if that 's the case , huh ? 
  yeah , when i think of people wanting to tear down big banks , go hard on huge corporations & crack down on tax havens , i think of ireland . 
  meh , i think you 're both pretty retarded for not actually understanding what * `` socialism '' * is . 
  * `` oh , look at me , with my free market economy & social programs funded by taxing private industry . 
  i 'm so socialist & contrarion on my privately owned land .

   the three soldiers died on tuesday after a roadside bomb hit a military vehicle that was traveling between the villages of **** and **** during their escape from the forces of the islamic state that were pursuing in the area . 
   here are some pictures and documents obtained by amaq agency and found in the possession of one of the dead soldiers , bodies were blackened by the explosion : [ ** remains of the burnt-out truck in which the aforementioned russian soldiers were supposedly killed in or by ** ] ( https://mobile.twitter.com/tri54poli54/status/745730885232664577 ) _________________________________________________________________________________ for those unaware , following a recent daesh counter-offensive against the regime 's * `` to raqqa '' * campaign , the saa , it 's pro-regime militia & russian advisers have effectively been [ ** ejected from the raqqa governorate ** ] ( https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/disastrous-turn-events-force-syrian-army-withdraw-west-raqqa/ ) by daesh .

  relatively sizable casualties . 
  ** disputed : ** whether the regime pre-maturely withdrawing * `` elite '' * units , or those units possibly withdrawing by their own inhibition without cordination , is to blame , or whether russia refusing to provide sufficient support & air cover is to blame . 
  whether the overall retreat was organized or disorganized . 
  whether the saa 's 555th regiment , which the regime 's * `` elite '' * units supposedly abandoned to be * `` crushed '' * has even existed at all since 2011 . 
  exact casualty figures & equipment lost .

  for context , al-masdar news is a pro-regime media outlet . 
   the islamic state of iraq and al-sham 's ( * isis * ) official media wing * `` al-amaq '' * alleged on wednesday that their forces killed three russian military advisers along the salamiyah-raqqa highway in west raqqa . 
   isis claimed they killed these three russian military advisers near the large desert village of albu allja , which is located between the zakiyah and rusafeh checkpoints . 
  the three military advisers were allegedly killed by one the islamic state 's many vbied ( * vehicle borne improvised explosive device * ) strikes this week . 
   this has not been confirmed by the russian military command ; however , the islamic state has released images of the soldiers they allegedly killed in west raqqa . 
  until people wan na make some money or need some international backing . 
  it 's all passive aggressive bitching until you want to watch * the wire * on your * iphone * on * netflix * or your country needs some military support & help with sanctions . 
  just because we 've been speaking softly for a couple years , does n't mean we have n't been walking around with a huge stick . 
  yeah , we should 've did it the swedish way . 
  ignore it , arm it & then invite it . 
  wow ... this is so ungodly wrong it makes my head hurt ... 
  i mean shit , just look at how much influence washington wielded or all the shit jefferson pulled ... and * he * was the leader of the small government party ... hell , and do n't even get me started on jackson . 
  that fucker was probably the closest we came to having a dictator power-wise . 
  also , ca n't forget the wartime authority lincoln wielded , or which johnson wielded after him during reconstruction . 
  oh , and i 'm like 95 % sure that * none * of our recent presidents could compare to fdr 's authority ... and the notion of having to have congress authorize a military deployment after a couple months was n't implemented until nixon ... and they overrode his veto for that ... 
  if anything ... the judicial branch has grown stronger while the legislature has pretty much remained steady ... with only the executive branch really ebbing & flowing ... but on the all pretty stable none-the-less ... which is why you can see the same spirit of arguments over branch authority being made at the turn of the 19th century as you can see at the turn of the 21st century ... one could also argue that * many * prime ministers have * much more * authority in a monarchial sense than our president ... what with one man , not bound by term limits much of the time , being able to control the executive & legislative branches at the same time , or the fact that in a number or countries , like the uk , since there is no set constitution , the prime minister can also overrule the courts with a majority vote in parliament ... thus basically brushing aside the judicial branch ... 
  we speak ` murican round here boy, 
  more than 2 iirc . 
  like 4 to 5 now i believe . 
  and yeah , we blanked on them ... after you blanked ... who do you think they blame most for causing that ? 
  and when it comes to shit like mali & other countries in francafrique , we 're always the ones they fall back on the most ... reluctantly on both our accounts ... 
  it usually goes like france begging the rest of europe to help because they want independent regional power projection , the united states prodding the rest of europe to help because we wan na focus on asia , and then europe spassing out , giving token support & then coming a year late with what was needed , while france & the u.s. have become reluctant bosom buddies in the meantime . 
  neither country likes it this way , both would want it the other way , but europe keeps dropping the ball . 
  you do when we 're the ones who will be leading the defense against the soviets in western europe in a war you started without even giving us so much as a heads-up . 
  not to mention we were also trying to sway arabian states away from the soviet sphere at the time , so you can imagine how our closest allies all-of-a-sudden deciding they 're going to re-colonize them & give a fuckton of their land to israel kinda annoyed us . 
  also , we did n't put a stop to france & the uk uniting . 
  you did . 
  twice . 
  first when you got cold feet in wwii & again when you outright rejected the idea against in the early 50s . 
  if anything , we 're the ones who have pushed for & encouraged uk integration with france . 
  to the point of prodding you for decades to go along with european integration despite reluctance & hesitation on your part . 
  also , we gave you a 90 % discount on lend-lease . 
  shit was practically free to begin with . 
  lol, 
  yeah , but you guys , like the germans , have kinda been pissing that away as of late . 
  now france 's most important & closest military partner is the united states , if not for any other reason but africa . 
  yeah , but we 're not talking about the last two world wars though ... we 're talking about the last couple decades ... and ... how did the irish government generally treat those irish veterans from wwii again after they fought for the british ? 
  we probably did more for the british than any other anglosphere country during the falklands . 
  we had a entire aircraft carrier prepped for you to take over immediately if you lost one , gave you vital up-to-date intelligence in regards to argentina & it 's military , armed you with a bunch of sidewinder & stinger missiles , and allowed you to use our military bases & aircraft for logistics & naval refueling * ( probably the most important thing we did ) * . 
  and we 're not even in the commonwealth . 
  in addition , canada is the country which probably backed us most adamantly on the suez canal crisis , and in addition , the soviet union was threatening a nuclear war & conventional conflict in western europe over it . 
  the uk & france literally gave us no warning that they were going to try & re-claim their colonial empire that day * ( oh , yeah , sorry for helping putting a end to that lol ) * & push the world to the brink of another world war , when it was * us * who would be the ones doing the most to defend your own countries in your own backyard . 
  also , ignoring us bailing you out in two world wars & helping rebuild your country after the 2nd one through things like the marshall plan because you wan na imply it had too high a price is a weird way to describe us letting you be one of the countries who benefitted most from & get the most preferential treatment in the american hegemony that followed . 
  i swear , despite a bunch of brits constantly reminding americans how the end of the british empire was the best thing that ever happened & you guys could n't be happier or more proud of colonialism dying , a lot of you sure do get passive aggressive about the shit & bitchy about the suez canal . 
  ireland & the united kingdom have a very close military relationship . 
  as in , ireland goes , * `` fuck it , we 're neutral , we do n't need to spend money on a military . 
  '' * and then the united kingdom goes * `` you ca n't just do that dipshit you still have borders & airspace that are connected to ours . 
  here , take a naval taskforce & two fighter squadrons for fucks sake . 
  if we still hated the british than you 'd of been our european israel . 
  how is this right here not blowback from germany throwing lenin on a sealed train cart to st. petersburg with money & guns to start a revolution ? 
  and then deciding to invade the country they helped give him twenty years later ? 
  that 's like ... double blowback ... and i doubt that whole peaceful & favorable reunification thing would 've went so swell if west germany did n't have a american military deterant at the fulda gap or american political backing at the negotiating table ... 
  i mean , would west germany even had been prosperous enough to carry the burden of east germany if the united states did n't help rebuild it with the marshall plan , forgive it 's debt & encourage it to integrate more with it 's largest trading partners in western europe under our security umbrella ? 
  would it even have survived as we remember it without the american-provided berlin airlift ? 
  oh , and i 'm * pretty sure * those people in the twin towers were pretty innocent despite you trying to imply otherwise . . 
  also cut down on red tape & curtailed corruption . 
  which is funny because every death & infection from mad cow disease we 've ever got has been from european beef .
