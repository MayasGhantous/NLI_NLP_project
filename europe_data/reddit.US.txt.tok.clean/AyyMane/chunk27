  [ ** well , that 's a lie . 
  lol ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_central_america )  nicaragua is the least stable country in the region , and the second poorest in the hemisphere after haiti . 
  nicaragua is the country that produces less , has the lowest hdi in the region , and even it has the lowest minimum wage in central america ( usd $ 141.00 ) . 
  nicaragua is the country that receives financial assistance in the region , since 4 out of 10 people live on less than a dollar a day , according to the pnud . 
  nicaragua is integrated into the bolivarian alliance for the peoples of our america ( alba ) . 
  and yet , ortega is still in power , nicragau is still the poorest & least-developped country in central america , and the sandinistas are probably maduro 's [ ** strongest backers ** ] ( http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/nicaraguas-sandinista-youth-back-venezuela-against-imperialism-20170513-0016.html ) outside of cuba . 
  bernie just has a soft spot for [ ** latin american dictators ** ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/when-bernie-sanders-thought-castro-and-the-sandinistas-could-teach-america-a-lesson ) loves him some latin american dictatorships :  in the 1980s , any bernie sanders event or interview inevitably wended toward a denunciation of washington 's central america policy , typically punctuated with a full-throated defense of the dictatorship in nicaragua . 
  as one sympathetic biographer wrote in 1991 , sanders `` * probably has done more than any other elected politician in the country to actively support the sandinistas and their revolution . 
  * '' reflecting on a potemkin tour of revolutionary nicaragua he took in 1985 , sanders marveled that he was , `` * believe it or not , the highest ranking american official * '' to attend a parade celebrating the sandinista seizure of power . 
   it 's quite easy to believe , actually , when one wonders what elected american official would knowingly join a group of largely unelected officials of various `` * fraternal * '' soviet dictatorships while , just a few feet away , nicaraguan president daniel ortega bellows into a microphone that the united states is governed by a criminal band of terrorists . 
   none of this bothered sanders , though , because he largely shared ortega 's worldview . 
  while opposition to reagan 's policy in central america -- including indefensible decisions like the mining of managua harbor -- was common amongst mainstream democrats , it was rare to find outright support for the soviet-funded , cuban-trained sandinistas . 
  indeed , congress 's vote to cut off administration funding of the anti-sandinista contra guerrillas precipitated the iran-contra scandal . 
   but despite its aversion to elections , brutal suppression of dissent , hideous mistreatment of indigenous nicaraguans , and rejection of basic democratic norms , sanders thought managua 's marxist-leninist clique had much to teach burlington : `` * vermont could set an example to the rest of the nation similar to the type of example nicaragua is setting for the rest of latin america . 
  * ''  _________  but sanders was mistaking aspirational sandinista propaganda for quantifiable sandinista achievement . 
  none of it was true , but it overlaid nicely on top of his own political views . 
  sanders 's almost evangelical belief in `` * the revolution * '' led him from extreme credulity to occasional fits of extreme paranoia . 
   for instance , in 1987 sanders hosted sandinista politician nora astorga in burlington , a woman notorious for a mata hari-like guerilla operation that successfully lured gen. reynaldo perez-vega , a high-ranking figure in the somoza dictatorship , to her apartment with promises of sex . 
  perez-vega 's body was later recovered wrapped in a sandinista flag , his throat slit by his kidnappers . 
  when astorga died in 1988 from cervical cancer , sanders took the occasion to publicly praise astorga as `` * a very , very beautiful woman * '' and a `` * very vital and beautiful woman , * '' positing that american foreign policy might have given her cancer . 
  he asked a group of university of vermont students to consider how `` * we deal with nicaragua , which is in many ways vietnam , except it 's worse . 
  it 's more gross . 
  * '' his answer was to raise money and civilian materiel for the revolution , establish a sister city program in nicaragua , and act as a mouthpiece for the sandinista government . 
   the local vermont journalist corps , with whom sanders had an extraordinarily contentious relationship , occasionally questioned sanders on nicaragua 's increasingly dictatorial drift . 
   in 1985 sanders traveled to new york city to meet with ortega just weeks after nicaragua imposed a `` * state of emergency * '' that resulted in mass arrests of regime critics and the shuttering of opposition newspapers and magazines . 
  while liberal critics of reagan 's nicaraguan policy rounded on the sandinistas ( talk-show host phil donahue told ortega that his actions looked `` * fascist * '' ) , sanders refused to condemn the decision . 
  he was `` * not an expert in nicaragua * '' and `` * not a nicaraguan , * '' he said during a press conference . 
  `` * am i aware enough of all the details of what is going on in nicaragua to say ` you have reacted too strongly ? ' i do n't know ... * '' but of course he did know , later saying that the sandinistas ' brutal crackdown `` * makes sense to me . 
  * ''  what `` * made sense * '' to sanders was the sandinistas ' war against la prensa , a daily newspaper whose vigorous opposition to the somoza dictatorship quickly transformed into vigorous opposition of the dictatorship that replaced it . 
  when challenged on the sandinistas ' incessant censorship , sanders had a disturbing stock answer : nicaragua was at war with counterrevolutionary forces , funded by the united states , and wartime occasionally necessitated undemocratic measures . 
  ( the sandinista state censor nelba blandon offered a more succinct answer : `` * they [ la prensa ] accused us of suppressing freedom of expression . 
  this was a lie and we could not let them publish it . 
  * '' )  ________  while freedom house and amnesty international agitated on behalf of la prensa , sanders was making excuses for the government that censored its articles , prevented it from buying newsprint , harassed its staffers , and arrested its journalists . 
   ________  sanders countered that he was free to quiz real nicaraguans on their political allegiances , but they `` laughed '' when he asked which party they backed because `` * of course they are with the government . 
  * '' when asked about the food shortages provoked by the sandinistas ' voodoo economic policy , sanders claimed that bread lines were a sign of a healthy economy , suggesting an equitable distribution of wealth : `` * it 's funny , sometimes american journalists talk about how bad a country is , that people are lining up for food . 
  that is a good thing !, 
  in other countries people do n't line up for food : the rich get the food and the poor starve to death . 
  * '' when asked about nicaragua 's notoriously brutal treatment of the miskito indians , the free press noted that sanders `` * attempted to cut off * '' the line of questioning . 
  ( ted kennedy called the sandinistas ' crimes against the indigenous miskitos `` * unconscionable , * '' `` * intolerable , * '' and `` * disturbing , * '' commenting that they were relocated at gunpoint to `` * forced-labor camps which resemble concentration camps . 
  * '' )  through the mayor 's council on the arts , sanders tried to bring some revolutionary third-worldism to vermont when he funded cable-access television that showed `` * films from cuba [ and ] daily television fare from nicaragua . 
  * '' at a press conference , sanders highlighted the grants that allowed the importation of `` * films produced in nicaragua , that appear on nicaraguan [ state ] television , on channel 15 . 
  we have films from cuba on channel 15 . 
  * ''  __________  ah , yes , let us not forget the democratic socialist shangri-la in havana . 
  in 1989 sanders traveled to cuba on a trip organized by the center for cuban studies , a pro-castro group based in new york , hoping to come away with a `` * balanced * '' picture of the communist dictatorship . 
  the late , legendary vermont journalist peter freyne sighed that sanders `` * came back singing the praises of fidel castro . 
  * ''  __________  sanders had a hunch that cubans actually appreciated living in a one-party state . 
  `` the people we met had an almost religious affection for [ fidel castro ] . 
  the revolution there is far deep and more profound than i understood it to be . 
  it really is a revolution in terms of values . '' it was a conclusion he had come to long before visiting the country . 
  years earlier sanders said something similar during a press conference : `` * you know , not to say fidel castro and cuba are perfect -- they are certainly not -- but just because ronald reagan dislikes these people does not mean to say the people in these nations feel the same . 
  * ''  there is , of course , a mechanism to measure the levels of popular content amongst the campesinos . 
  perhaps it 's too much to expect ademocratic socialist to be familiar with the free election , a democratic nicety the cuban government has n't availed itself of during its almost 60 years in power . 
   __________  during his tenure as mayor , burlington established sister-city programs in nicaragua and the soviet union , and tried -- and failed -- to create one in cuba . 
   __________  sandinista strongman daniel ortega , while achieving none of the milestones bernie sanders once claimed he had achieved , stole enormous amounts of money from the nicaraguan people and was , to name just one example , behind the infamous bombing at la penca which killed seven people ( including three journalists ) . 
  literally : [ ** labour mp insists venezuela is n't a socialist country ** ] ( http://talkradio.co.uk/news/labour-mp-insists-venezuela-isnt-socialist-country-17080216951 ), 
  better go threaten to sanction romania too germany . 
   venezuela is a basket case but i am truly sick of hearing about it . 
  where were you when corbyn was praising it for years then ? 
  lol, 
   a labour mp has criticised the united states ' decision to impose sanctions on the venezuelan president , who the us called a '' * dictator * '' . 
   chris williamson said it would be '' * better to facilitate talks * '' between the government and the opposition . 
   labour leader jeremy corbyn has faced pressure from some of his mps to condemn president nicolas maduro , after voicing support for him in the past . 
   more than 120 people have died during months of unrest in the country . 
   two opposition leaders who boycotted a controversial election to create a new constitutional assembly - denouncing it as an attempt by the government to strengthen its power - were put in a military prison on tuesday . 
   ____________  under the sanctions , announced on monday , us firms and individuals are banned from doing business with president maduro . 
   '' * surely it would be far better to try and bring the sides together , to facilitate talks and to encourage the right wing opposition to stop these protests on the streets , * '' mr williamson added . 
   venezuela 's 30 million citizens are suffering shortages of food , basic goods and medicines . 
   families of uk diplomatic staff in the oil-rich country have been temporarily withdrawn from the country as anti-government protests continue . 
   ____________  mr corbyn has previously supported the venezuelan government under both socialist president hugo chavez and his successor mr maduro . 
   as a backbencher mr corbyn attended a 2013 vigil following the death of mr chavez , hailing him as an '' * inspiration to all of us fighting back against austerity and neo-liberal economics in europe * '' . 
  he also shared a platform with mr maduro in 2006 . 
   ken livingstone has given his backing to beleaguered venezuelan president nicolas maduro and accused the us of trying to `` * undermine * '' the south american country . 
   the former mayor of london re-iterated his support for mr maduro despite who has been widely criticised in his homeland for an economic crisis and an election which was widely boycotted by his opponents . 
   ___________  '' * hugo ch\u00e1vez did not execute the establishment elite , he allowed them to continue so they 're still there * '' , he told the times . 
  `` * i think there 's a lot of rumours they 've been blocking the important food and medicines and things like that because they control a lot of the companies . 
  * ''  he added : `` * america has got a long record of undermining any left-wing government as well . 
  so i suspect it 's not all just down to the problems of the [ venezuelan ] government . 
  * ''  asked whether he continued to support mr maduro , he replied : `` * oh god , yes . 
  * ''  during his time as mayor , mr livingstone welcomed mr. chavez to city hall and struck a deal for venezuela to provide # 16m worth of oil every year to transport for london in exchange for british support with urban planning and management . 
   jeremy corbyn has also been a firm ally of venezuela and its socialist governments , although less vocally since becoming labour leader . 
  yeah , but the u.s. economy is similiar-sized & also developped , but grew by [ ** 2.6 % ** ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-gdp-accelerates-to-26-in-second-quarter-2017-07-28 ) , more than 3x as much . 
  for comparison to a similiar sized developped economy , the united states grew by [ ** 2.6 % ** ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-gdp-accelerates-to-26-in-second-quarter-2017-07-28 ) in the 2nd quarter . 
  [ ** european defence community ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_defence_community ), 
  i think drawing from the 12 traditionally accepted founding fathers of the eu would be a good choice . 
  deciding which ones should be included , and then ranking then , seems like it 'd be a fun debate though .
