  * ' long-term imprisonment in an american jail or suicide : such is the 32-year-old british hacker 's bleak assessment of his options as he contemplates his future from a bayswater caf\u00e9 . 
   two years ago , officers from the metropolitan police service appeared at the door of the suffolk home where love lives with his parents to arrest him on an extradition request from the us . 
  his alleged crime ? 
  hacking into dozens of government computer systems , including those of the fbi , us army and department of defense , stealing ` * massive amounts * ' of data and defacing official websites . 
   last september , westminster magistrates ' court granted the extradition request . 
  if found guilty of the charges , love faces up to 99 years in prison and $ 9 million ( * # 7 million * ) in fines . 
  he is appealing the decision in the high court in november on the grounds that he has asperger 's syndrome and severe depression , and would be a suicide risk in the care of a us penal system unable to deal with his conditions . 
   __________  if love 's plight sounds familiar , that 's perhaps because it has echoes of the case of gary mckinnon , the british hacker who was arrested in 2002 for allegedly penetrating the defences of nasa and pentagon computers in pursuit of evidence of ufos . 
  he believed the us government was hiding extraterrestrial technology that might solve the world 's energy problems . 
   three years later , mckinnon was charged by us authorities who applied for his extradition from the uk . 
  the case dragged on for years , during which time mckinnon , like love , was diagnosed with asperger 's syndrome . 
  by 2012 , when theresa may , then home secretary , ruled mckinnon would not , after all , be extradited , he was holed up in his house , researching suicide methods . 
   but their cases differ in one crucial respect . 
  after ruling on mckinnon 's case , may introduced legislation that transferred the final decision-making power to the courts , making it difficult for the current home secretary , amber rudd , to intervene in love 's case . 
  all now rests on the high court 's decision in november . 
   ____________  unlike mckinnon , love is not accused of being a lone operator pursuing an esoteric agenda . 
   ____________  the accusations against love are that he was part of a wider activist network of hackers engaged in a political undertaking . 
  he is charged with hacking the us government as part of a protest against the treatment of aaron swartz , a programmer renowned for helping develop the social network reddit . 
   swartz was arrested in 2011 for allegedly downloading articles en masse from an american academic-journal site with the intention of sharing them online . 
  facing up to 35 years in prison under the computer fraud and abuse act , he hanged himself in 2013 . 
   _________  before swartz 's suicide , a group calling itself anonymous launched operation last resort , a ` hacktivism ' protest against swartz 's charges . 
  anonymous has in the past campaigned against nation states , religious groups and major corporations . 
   __________  allegedly , love was one of the four anonymous hackers who claimed to have breached computers run by the us army in october 2012 , with access to 400,000 emails and 4,000 employee details . 
  the protest continued after swartz 's death . 
   at one point , the us sentencing commission site was defaced with a version of the 1980s video game asteroids . 
  after the us department of energy was hacked , love , under the moniker ` * peace * ' , allegedly wrote to the other hackers , ` * yassss , i am invincible !!!, 
  * ' three months later the uk 's national crime agency appeared at his door to arrest him . 
  two years after that he was charged in new york , new jersey and virginia with conspiracy to defraud the us through computer activity . 
   _______  american courts deal with illegal hackers severely . 
  the longest sentence for a computer crime in the us is 27 years , handed to a russian hacker earlier this year . 
  in the uk , it 's less than three years . 
  had he been prosecuted in britain in 2013 , love would have served the maximum sentence by now . 
  ` * i would n't be worrying about this any more . 
  i have n't been in a jail cell for most of the past four years , but i have been dealing with this on a daily basis , * ' he says . 
  i 'm honestly surprised juncker even found the time to go after google , apple & every other american tech company europe has trouble competing with . 
  his schedule just seems like it 'd be so full between helping southern europeans set up shell companies in luxembourg & lecturing southern europe on the importance of austerity . 
   also , us is too op . 
  to avoid a nerf we 've agreed to delay entry by three years . 
   first : i gave nothing , since i have never been member of any government or company in this business . 
    however it is clear to me since 49 % are owned by european companies it is about the europeans to decide about sanctions concerning them . 
  so america ca n't unilaterally sanction the state-owned companies of a non-eu country , russia , over non-eu matters , the ukrainian conflict & election meddling , without clearing it 's foreign policy through the eu first ? 
  else the eu will sanction us to protect russia ? 
  lol okay , do it . 
  oh , and by the way , 49 % of a foreign company means you do n't own shit . 
  instead it means you 're just invested in somebody else 's shit . 
  and i apologize that your sugardaddy is getting sanctioned . 
  oh shit my fault . 
  lol edited . 
  just kinda figured you know , since he 's been in there so long . 
  though i will say for paul , who 's junior to mcconnel , it is surprising the kentucky gave birth to two so radically different republicans . 
  it might be the same scenario with bernie & leahy when talking about liberals in general , but i do n't know enough about leahy to comment . 
  you seen to be confused . 
  you gave gazprom 51 % ownership over nordstream i & ii , and helped/are helping them build these massive pipelines coming directly from russia to pump gazprom 's natural gas . 
  gazprom is a state-owned company of russia . 
  their natural gas is russian . 
  they own the pipelines . 
  so , i have to ask you , why should gazprom be exempt from sanctions on russia ? 
  or , since they 're state-owned , in other words , why should russia be exempt from sanctions on russia ? 
  rand paul , the junior senator from kentucky & son of ron paul the savior , and bernie sanders , the junior senator from vermont & leader of our political revolution , because of the iran sanctions for the most part . 
  i do n't really disagree with them on that point to be completely honest , but there was no way you were going to get a veto-proof piece of legislation for sanctions like this against russia , with restrictions on trump too , through the gop , and on trump 's desk , without binding them together with iran first . 
  compromise is a bitch sometimes . 
  but anyway , both of them have built a following around never compromising on their beliefs for political points , solidarity or to help push a seperate agenda , so eh , good to have them around to break-up the echo chamber in both respective parties . 
  good . 
  he said as ukraine choked , trump laughed & eastern europe worried . 
  a article from two days ago before it passed the senate for a little more context : [ ** russia warns of ` * painful * ' response if trump backs u.s. sanctions ** ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-26/russia-says-new-u-s-sanctions-killing-chances-for-improved-ties?utm_campaign=pol&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;utm_source=applenews )  russia threatened to retaliate against new sanctions passed by the u.s. house of representatives , saying they made it all but impossible to achieve the trump administration 's goal of improved relations . 
   the measures push u.s.-russia ties into uncharted territory and `` * do n't leave room for the normalization of relations * '' in the foreseeable future , deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said wednesday , according to the interfax news service . 
   hope `` * is dying * '' for improved relations because the scale of `` * the anti-russian consensus in congress makes dialogue impossible and for a long time , * '' konstantin kosachyov , chairman of the international affairs committee in russia 's upper house of parliament , said on facebook . 
  russia should prepare a response to the sanctions that 's `` * painful for the americans , * '' he said . 
   the bill , passed by a vote of 419-3 on tuesday , would strengthen sanctions against russia less than three weeks after president donald trump and his russian counterpart vladimir putin held their first official meeting at the group of 20 summit . 
  the measure , which now goes to the senate , would let congress block any effort by trump to unilaterally weaken sanctions imposed under the obama administration for russian meddling in the 2016 presidential elections and its support for separatists in ukraine . 
  the white house has sent mixed signals about whether trump will sign the bill . 
   __________  the sanctions are `` * pretty sad from the viewpoint of russian-american relations and prospects for developing them , and no less depressing from the perspective of international law and international trade , * '' kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters wednesday on a conference call . 
  putin will decide on a response if the bill becomes law , he said . 
   trump will sign the law because `` * he 's a prisoner of congress and anti-russian hysteria , * '' alexei pushkov , a senator in russia 's upper house of parliament , said on twitter . 
  the sanctions are `` * a new stage of confrontation , * '' he said . 
   __________  russia has prepared `` * economic and political measures that will be adopted if the senate and trump support the bill , * '' said vladimir dzhabarov , deputy chairman of the international affairs committee in the upper house , the ria novosti news service reported . 
  relations with the u.s. `` * are at such a low level that we have nothing to lose * '' by retaliating , he said . 
   ________  the house vote adds to deepening russian gloom over prospects for a breakthrough in relations , six months after trump took office pledging to improve ties with putin . 
  russia threatened last week to expel u.s. diplomats and seize embassy property in moscow after ryabkov failed to gain agreement at talks in washington for the return of russian diplomatic compounds . 
  [ ** putin ** ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/27/putin-russia-us-sanctions-bill ) himself also called congress * `` insolent '' * & vowed retaliation after the senate passed it . 
  but back to the point , the sanctions passed 98-2 in the senate & 419-3 in the house . 
  for reference , you only need 67 votes in the senate & 290 votes in the house to override a presidential veto .
