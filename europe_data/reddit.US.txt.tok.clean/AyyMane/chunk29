  [ ** well , they sure have russia shitting bricks .

   the measures push u.s.-russia ties into uncharted territory and `` * do n't leave room for the normalization of relations * '' in the foreseeable future , deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said wednesday , according to the interfax news service . 
   hope `` * is dying * '' for improved relations because the scale of `` * the anti-russian consensus in congress makes dialogue impossible and for a long time , * '' konstantin kosachyov , chairman of the international affairs committee in russia 's upper house of parliament , said on facebook . 
  russia should prepare a response to the sanctions that 's `` * painful for the americans , * '' he said . 
   the bill , passed by a vote of 419-3 on tuesday , would strengthen sanctions against russia less than three weeks after president donald trump and his russian counterpart vladimir putin held their first official meeting at the group of 20 summit . 
  the measure , which now goes to the senate , would let congress block any effort by trump to unilaterally weaken sanctions imposed under the obama administration for russian meddling in the 2016 presidential elections and its support for separatists in ukraine . 
  the white house has sent mixed signals about whether trump will sign the bill . 
   __________  the sanctions are `` * pretty sad from the viewpoint of russian-american relations and prospects for developing them , and no less depressing from the perspective of international law and international trade , * '' kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters wednesday on a conference call . 
  putin will decide on a response if the bill becomes law , he said . 
   trump will sign the law because `` * he 's a prisoner of congress and anti-russian hysteria , * '' alexei pushkov , a senator in russia 's upper house of parliament , said on twitter . 
  the sanctions are `` * a new stage of confrontation , * '' he said . 
   __________  russia has prepared `` * economic and political measures that will be adopted if the senate and trump support the bill , * '' said vladimir dzhabarov , deputy chairman of the international affairs committee in the upper house , the ria novosti news service reported . 
  relations with the u.s. `` * are at such a low level that we have nothing to lose * '' by retaliating , he said . 
   ________  the house vote adds to deepening russian gloom over prospects for a breakthrough in relations , six months after trump took office pledging to improve ties with putin . 
  russia threatened last week to expel u.s. diplomats and seize embassy property in moscow after ryabkov failed to gain agreement at talks in washington for the return of russian diplomatic compounds . 
  so there 's that . 
  i can understand europe 's frustration however . 
  when your companies are helping gazprom build a massive pipeline that 's going to be 51 % owned by gazprom , and is going to be pumping gazprom 's gas , it 's hard not to get caught up in sanctions that could hurt gazprom .

  you know , i actually agree america should begin implementing more european-style healthcare & social safety nets . 
   plus they 're still a bit spoiled with all the resources they have as citizens . 
  but this right here shows me you do n't actually comprehend or respect the resources that go into , and are nessecarry , to maintain those types of systems , and the clusterfuck the italian state is facing in regards to it 's future . 
  most of the world ca n't really afford it in a developped fashion . 
  italy , because of it 's lack of capital & shitty demographics , is starting to be unable to afford it too , and the solutions to fix it , the importation of german/northern european capital & north african migrants , the implementation of a eu fiscal system , etc. 
  seem to just be making things worse america has none of those problems , in fact , we basically have everything we need to maintain & keep growing at a healthy rate from a already-healthy base , and then some . 
  you 're asking people to be thankful for watching their very national foundation erode in a way which no solution seems to fix or stabilize * ( in fact , sometimes it does the opposite ) * , and doing it by pointing to how shit america is , when america is n't that shit & who 's main problem is a lingering unwillingness to implement what you want as opposed to a growing inability . 
  one of those is frustrating , but the other is scary . 
  the united states has much more capital than italy with much better demographics and a stronger , more integrated fiscal union to connect it all . 
  this is why our consumer market is bigger than most of the eu & china combined , our financial markets are the most massive in the world , we 're the world 's largest food producer with the most arable land , we 're the largest r&d spender and our internal market is so massive that trade as a percentage of gdp is lower for us than almost every other major country in the world . 
  we do n't have to import german/northern european capital & north african migrants to compensate for our situation , and we 're not forced to depend on a ever-fractured & handicapled eu fiscal arrangement to hold it all together when those things start pushing against the seams of national society . 
  and we literally do have a good education system . 
  otherwise we 'd be facing the same problem north africa is facing with it 's young people & italy is now facing with it 's new migrants . 
  we can improve more on our social safety net , but we do have one . 
  i know this because i grew up surrounded by people on food stamps & medicaid . 
  idk where the fuck your well-off ass grew up if you did n't know anybody on either . 
  i agree on universal healthcare , but once again , like with our social safety net , the foundation to fund & maintain it is there & will continue to be there . 
  italy is watching that foundation erode , and not only is it watching it erode , but every solution , the german capital , the north african migrants , the eu fiscal system , seems to be de-stabilizing the entire situation more than helping reverse the erosion . 
  it 's literally about sanctions on russia , a european country . 
  implementation of new ones & the upholding of old ones . 
  how is this textbook off-topic ? 
  and when you remove a post for even like a hour , it basically burries it . 
  so what 's the point of discussing it ? 
  how is this not on topic ? 
  and the spam filter filters it , i send modmail , mod approves it , but another mod takes it down , but than puts it back up , and now you 're taking it down again ? 
  wtf ? 
  it 's been postponed for the senate , not for the house . 
  nobody 's sure yet if ryan will follow mcconnell 's lead . 
  although he 's getting pressure from reps to do it & trump * ( lol ) * himself , who wants some kind of major legislation on his desk to sign & point too for a first year accomplishment . 
  i think he will if he can , but the senate is pretty much guranteed to pass it with more than the 67 votes out of 100 needed for a veto-proof majority * ( they passed the original bill 98-2 ) * . 
  so it really just comes down to the house , which needs 290 votes out of 435 for a veto-proof majority , which most people seem to think is likely . 
  and for context , if all 194 democrat congressmen vote for it , than you 'd only need less than half of the 240 republican congressmen to go for it * ( 94 overall ) * . 
  and if that happens , i can see trump signing it anyway just to avoid the headline * `` trump hit with first veto override in less than a year since taking office because of russia '' * . 
  ** edit : ** also looks like trump might be able to use a pocket veto , which is when the bill can die if the president sends it back unsigned to the house it originally came from after 10 days , but congress is n't in session to respond to it . 
  but half of the august recess was already cancelled for the senate , which is where the bill came from , so they 'll still be in session to recieve it , but i 'm not sure what 's going on with ryan & the house of reps , even as many reps are pushing for him to delay recess like mcconnell did , and trump himself said they should n't leave * ( the irony lol ) * until they put something significant on his desk to sign . 
   despite the white house lobbying for changes to the measure , the legislation will give congress a new ability to block the administration from easing sanctions on moscow . 
   ____________  congressional aides say they expect trump will sign the bill because it will likely pass both chambers with strong , veto-proof majorities . 
  cool , cool thank you . 
  yet when it comes to tech , most potential heavy-hitters tend to get bought up or outcompeted by the googles , facebooks , apples , microsofts & amazons of the world that were borne from american venture capital . 
   openly disrespect and circumvent top-level us leadership . 
  the fact that * this * is the face of `` open disrespect '' & `` circumventing america '' is my entire point . 
  i mean , seriously , how dominated by american soft power do you have to be to seriously compare the petty gestures as of late to the days when america was a * `` colonial upstart '' * ? 
  and , not to mention , you 're saying all of this in english on a american website with a american majority userbase . 
  lol, 
  we ai n't force you too buy that iphone & stream * breaking bad * off netflix bruh . 
  are you sure it 's just that ? 
  because future access to & already existing ties with silicon valley venture capital , wall street markets , hollywood production & ivy league research seems like one hell of a pull too . 
  but the uk is in 2nd despite the iraq war & brexit too ... . 
  but even then , the non-coercive & cooperatve economic , cultural & technologichal influence we exercise , best represented by the three places i mentioned above * ( wall street , hollywood & silicon valley ) * far outstrip that of france and act as the foundation for our soft power . 
  and we 're not really ranked that low in the study either anyway . 
  lol we 're still 3rd place yo . 
  yeah , but the british empire did it mostly by hard power , through colonialism . 
  america did it , and continues to do it , by soft power for the most part , which this is ranking . 
  as for things like [ ** silicon valley & venture capital ** ] ( https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/which-countries-have-the-most-venture-capital-investments/ ) :  ** annual venture capital investment ( * 2014 * ) **  * ** america ** - *** $ 52.1 billion ***  * ** china ** - *** $ 15.5 billion ***  * ** europe ** - *** $ 10.6 billion ***  ___________  ** total venture capital invested ( * 2006-2013 * ) **  * ** america ** - *** $ 254.6 billion ***  * ** europe ** - *** $ 55.4 billion ***  * ** china ** - *** $ 33.05 billion *** and i understand that the study above does n't deal specifically with germany & was published back in 2015 , only dealing with figures that go up into 2014 , but i still think there 's a lot of truth to the dynamic it presents , even in the year of trump , if not for any other reason but the utter disparity between america & everybody else . 
  the fact it helps push you to respect & compromise with a incompetant leadership in the way you have with trump should be evidence enough of it 's strength . 
  yeah , but how does france surpass the united states in non-coercive technological , economic & cultural influence ? 
  the international success of hollywood , wall street & silicon valley , of our world ranking private universities , has n't really been depedent upon or proliferated by government coercian , at least relatively speaking in comparison to framce . 
  one could even argue that 's been a foundation of their success . 
  now compare that to france with it 's massive state initiatives to bolster all the above & strongly push it abroad . 
  to it 's backing of things like a netflix tax & content quota . 
  to even macron 's $ 66 million climate scientist fund directly targetted by the state at snatching up american scientists . 
  i mean , the french state strongly supports & pushes things like the organisation internationale de la francophonie & the acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise to preserve the influence of french . 
  all america does is just speak english & everybody starts adopting it of their own accord because that 's where all the money , tech & blockbusters are . 
  how is french influence more effective though ? 
  it does n't even come close to matching the mountains we can move from east asia to the middle east to south america in regards to economic , technological & cultural influence . 
  i mean , you can point out francafrique & the eu , but the united states has massive ties with & a presence in both those places too , not enough to match france of course , but probably enough to equalize it to the point that it allows the u.s. to surpass france in soft power globally .
