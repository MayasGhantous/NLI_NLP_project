  i mean , just imagine if france had the type of pull in north america that america has in europe . 
  that dynamic right there should put the rest of the globe in perspective . 
  yeah , but we still have a larger diplomatic network than france , and i 'd wager a much larger foreign intelligence one too . 
  a conservative-leaning supreme court upheld obamacare & basically legalized gay marriage . 
  why are you being sarcastic ? 
  although , tbh , it 's kinda different in america . 
  we 're not a parliamentary democracy centered on the fusion of powers , we 're a presidential democracy centered on the seperation of powers . 
  the president does n't have the type of authority over the legislature that a prime minister has . 
  and after confirmation , removing a judge from office is a utter bitch that requires a entire impeachment proceeding . 
  when did france start making more blockbusters than hollywood , churning out more start-ups than silicon valley & doing more trades than wall street ? 
  i mean , if cultural , technological & economic influence do n't matter when it comes to soft power , wtf is the point of soft power ? 
  lol, 
  with the exception of like norway & luxembourg , the united states has a higher median & average wage than pretty much all of western europe , with a decently lower cost of living too . 
  the u.s. has had continous growth since the great recession & recovered all the ground it lost in 2012 . 
  the eu otoh had a double-dip recession that it did n't exit until 2013 & it only recovered all the ground it lost from before the great recession * last year * . 
  different strokes . 
  how am i insecure when you just implied we own the world ? 
  lol those types of perceptions , even if exagerated , are exactly what constitutes soft power . 
  it 's corporate , diplomatic & cultural influence . 
  am i insecure for pointing out we exceed france in these regards ? 
  i mean fuck dude , lol , can i not have a logical disagreement without people lambasting me as a stupid fucking american because they dislike my country as a whole ? 
  can you focus on what i 'm saying for a minute & not just my nationality ? 
  or is that too much to ask ? 
  it also says france overtook america in soft power . 
  and i mean , listen , i like macron , i hate trump , but france did n't start churning out more shit than hollywood , silicon valley & wall street after either was elected ... and the lingua franca did n't stop being english & start being french again overnight either . 
  idk who the fuck put this shit out , but i 've seen a lot more legit soft power rankings and this right here just seems to de-legitamize the whole concept . 
  like ... i get that politics are super important ... but ugh ... hollywood , silicon valley & wall street did n't all just stop working or some shit on inauguration day ... and mandarin has n't exactly overtaken us as the lingua franca * ( ha !, 
  ironic in context ) * yet . 
  i completely agree . 
  and i think the overall division in the western world atm , and strain being put on the trans-atlantic relationship from both sides of the pond , is one of the biggest threats to both our countries ' * ( and union 's ) * national/supranational interests . 
  anti-american sentiment in europe , anti-eu sentiment in britain & anti-globalist sentiment in america are creating a very self-destructive situation for all of us . 
  well , the eu & it 's official predessor organizations were n't around back then , but i get what you 're saying , and if it did prop us up , than i think we repaid the favor in full , and then some , when we intervened during both wars to help the liberal democratic side of europe to win * ( well ... and +1 for the 2nd war if we 're being honest ) * . 
  i mean , we were late both times , and we should 've come sooner , but it was still decisive in both contexts & essential to allied victory in my opinion * ( perhaps more so for the western european allies in the 2nd war than the sovet union , ignoring debates over how important , or not , lend-lease was for them ) * . 
  a * `` french initiative '' * which was authored by frenchmen who was suspected of being a american agent by de gaul , and a initiative that , as described by it 's very architects , started in washington dc of all places . 
  and what do you mean * `` what '' * ? 
  we threatened to cut aid being given through the marshall plan if france did n't start playing nice with germany & treating it like a equal after wwii . 
  an now by this point i 'm literally just repeating the source i clearly quoted above . 
  lol, 
  i do n't agree with the opinion of the author myself , but the points he references about american support for the eu 's creation are accurate . 
   the problem is that none of those things made germany and france each other 's closest friend and ally . 
  well ... i mean ... threatening france to play nice with germany under truman & then throwing all our weight behind supporting the schuman declaration kinda did to be honest ... 
  sure , i 'm not arguing that . 
  but ... just for the record ... we did openly fund , discretly bribe , covertly threaten , & publically encourage you to band together too ... 
  no , but i 'll be damned if america was n't one of the most important driving forces behind it & i 'd also argue that the conditions created by american hegemony were essential for it to happen regardless of anything else . 
  hence my contention with giving the eu in itself all the credit for the post-wwii peace , stability , prosperity & political atmosphere . 
  it does n't even deserve most the credit . 
  because , like i said above , it was , for the most part , a child born from that , not one who helped create it .

  it 's so weird . 
  that 's exactly when american hegemony started too . 
  it 's almost like the military protection , economic support & diplomatic encouragement for integration provided by america had a bigger role or something ... like ... the eu was instead a child of that period of peace & stability where liberal democratic politics & free market economics were encouraged , rather than a driving force behind it or something ... 
  because america is the one who kept the peace , not the eu . 
  in fact , the eu would n't be around if america had n't been militarily protecting europe , economically propping it up & diplomatically supporting integration . 
  i mean , we can go on all day about nato , the fulda gap , berlin airlift , german debt forgiveness , etc. , but even more so to the point when it comes to the eu : [ ** american committee on united europe ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_committee_on_united_europe )  the american committee on united europe ( * acue * ) , founded in 1948 , was an american organization which sought to counter the communist threat in europe by promoting european political integration . 
  its first chairman was ex-wartime oss head william joseph donovan . 
   _________  declassified american government documents have shown that the acue was an important early funder of both the european movement and the european youth campaign . 
   ________  the u.s. policy was to promote a united states of europe , and to this end the committee was used to discreetly funnel cia funds - by the mid 50 's acue was receiving roughly $ 1,000,000 usd per year - to european pro-federalists supporting such organizations as the council of europe , the european coal and steel community , and the proposed european defence community . 
   the end of an article appearing in the daily telegraph in september 2000 noted that : '' * the state department also played a role . 
  a memo from the european section , dated june 11 , 1965 , advises the vice-president of the european economic community , robert marjolin , to pursue monetary union by stealth .

  this is good & makes me happy . 
  but like with everything trump , every positive action must have a opposite & far greater negative reaction . 
  i 'm now expecting trump to declare war on the netherlands & invade belgium by mistake . 
  yes , and we 're going to stay a strong , single nation because of it . 
  when the country was founded it was at a time when the colonies treated each other like foreign states & the political dynamic was more like that between eu members than modern-day states . 
  an i think many a european federalist would give their left nut for the type of long-lasting , ever-deepening union our government has produced & maintained over the past few centuries . 
  so when you see archaic , i see reliably functioning , and when you see asinine , i see a better working & better tested system than the eu , one which achieved more in a shorter time for what 's likely too be a longer time , and one who managed to prevent it 's own brexit & potential grexit . 
  europeans love to mock us for our * `` artificial '' * identity , but honestly , i think it 's one of our most important achievements & one only made possible by our system of government .
