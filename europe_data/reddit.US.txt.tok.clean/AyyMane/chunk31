  very unifying . 
  also : [ ** average wage ( * ppp * ) ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_average_wage ) * ** united states ** - $ 60,154 * ** germany ** - $ 46,389 [ ** median wage ( * ppp * ) ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income ) * ** united states ** - $ 43,585 * ** germany ** - $ 33,333 and to be quite honest , the broader income spectrum might actually work in america 's favor , especially when you see just how much broader it is compared to germany despite still having a decently higher median wage than germany . 
  yeah , but facebook & google are barely a decade old . 
  apple , microsoft & the other legacy big hitters outside of like ibm are barely a generation old , and even they could n't stop the rise of google , amazon & facebook . 
  the very examples you 're giving are pretty much * `` new money '' * too & a result of america 's modern start-up industry . 
  europe is n't just lacking in this field today , it lacked in this field ten , twenty & thirty years ago as well . 
  it has n't so much been stiffled as it has n't really got off the starting line to begin with , whether talking pre-microsoft , pre-google or the present-day . 
  except ... really really ? 
  lol do you even comprehend what * `` checks & balances '' * are ? 
  you know ... seperation of powers , federal autonomy , constitutional gurantees of all this , etc. . 
  he does n't define or negate their existance . 
  in fact , his existance is the entire reason for their existance . 
  if there were n't people like him than there would n't be a need for them . 
  and they have been rather clearly demonstrated in regards to both the legislative & judicial branches . 
  otherwise , your link does n't prove , say or demonstrate anything to disprove that . 
  at all . 
  lol i mean , it 's * literally * apples & oranges . 
  you 're comparing the parliamentary system of a unitary country with no real executive branch to a federal country with a strong executive branch & very clear seperation from the legislative branch . 
  not to mention , one has a party-based election system , the other a individual-based election system . 
  ** but anyway , fucking seriously , where has our constitutional foundations been challenged in any way what-so-ever comparable to places like turkey & poland ? 
  ** an hell , even trump 's election , even if i despise the man , is a type of check & balance in itself . 
  the electoral system is specifically designed in a way to balance the influence of less populated states with more populated states . 
  each state is guranteed 3 electors because each state is guranteed that big of a congressional delegation . 
  and while states like new york & california have huge congressional delegations , they , like everybody else , is limited to only 2 senators , and thus , the 2 electors that correspond to them . 
  so while the most populated states will always determine the president 7-8 times out of 10 , when supermajority of smaller states in vote for the other guy , they can override the popular vote , as with trump . 
  and once again , while i despise the man , i 'd rather the less-populated rural states have him as a stress release for 4 years than let the wounds fester for 20 years & end up with the disease of serious seccession . 
  because than you end up with thinks like catalonia , scotland , basque country , northern ireland , brexit , grexit or the clusterfuck that is belgium . 
  i mean , remember , it 's the united states of america under a federal government , not the republic of america under a unitary government . 
  both set-ups are still representative democracies , but with very different ways approaches & goals . 
  i do n't understand ? 
  what do you mean by * `` this shit '' * ? 
  if anything the united states checks & balance have held up remarkably well . 
  the trump presidency has even helped demonstrate this , even if i preferred the boundaries were n't tested in the first place . 
  plus , the comparison to the uk does n't really make any sense . 
  the uk does n't really have no checks & balances compared to america . 
  the legislative branch dominates everything with little seperation of powers , with the executive being little more than a ceremonial figurehead & judicial branch having to always yield to legislative suptemacy with the lack of a constitution to draw authority from . 
  there is no guranteed , federal autonomy for it 's regions , and no u.s. senate-type chamber to help compensate for the voice less populated like scotland . 
  i mean , hell , there 's a reason our democracy is older than every democracy in continental europe . 
  i mean , shit , our republic has literally survived multiple wars , economic crises , social upheavals & technological transformations ... . guiding the countries ' centuries long journey from small backwater coastal republic to continent-spanning global superpower ... 
  america would likely withdraw into itself like it was prone to do pre-wwii , what with it 's most powerful pacific & atlantic allies turning on it . 
  possibility there might be re-alignment towards latin america if not downright isolationism . 
  japan & germany would lose their most important ally in regards to upholding liberal democratic & free market influence internationally . 
  and since america would lose the system of alliances it needed to drive liberal democratic & free market influence internationally in this scenario , it might no longer care for keeping active membership in the very international organizations it helped create to shape the global order * ( league of nations 2.0 ) * . 
  illiberal authoritarians in russia & china will pop their state capitalist champagne , and double-down on expanding their influence in eastern europe & east asia respectfully at the expense of america , germany & japan . 
  but japan , germany & america wo n't become actual enemies in my opinion though . 
  they may very well become deeply divided & isolated from each other however . 
  identity politics ? 
  lol bruh , i 'm like 90 % sure you 're not using that word right . 
  we 're literally talking about foreign policy & international geopolitics . 
  and how the fuck do you lecture me on that , but then label all americans as being no better than chimpanzees ? 
  in fact , your entire post history in this thread has basically just been playing upon the ugly american sterotype . 
  oh , and you still have n't answered on whether you 're a european or not . 
  never said we were without flaws , just that our very political foundation shares more values & culture with the eu than russia & china . 
  an shit , to be real , rather fuck up & end up trump , despite how much i hate the man , than fuck up & end up with mao . 
  lmao and i 'd rather be a proud self-identifying american in el paso than being forcibly labeled as chinese in taiwan under threat . 
   they are not you 're not european ? 
  what are you ? 
  and we 'll do what we do . 
  we 'll defend our allies & our allies will defend us . 
  we 'll support them & they 'll support us . 
  it 's in our national interests as it is in their national interests . 
  your desperate anti-american bullshit , insults & cheering about our downfall quickly being traded in for * `` but it 's for your own good trust me just do it '' * kinda betrays the fact you recongnize that already too outside of the propaganda bullshit . 
  lol and i think that scares you . 
  the alliance survived schroeder 's putin-loving bullshit and it 'll survive trump 's putin-loving bullshit . 
  russia & china are illiberal authoritarian regimes with a focus on state capitalism . 
  america & the eu are liberal democracies with a focus on free-market capitalism . 
  the eu was literally forged under american hegemony , with american military protection , american economic support & even early european federalists being funded by america . 
  europe & america are natural allies . 
  lol a poll that was literally taken before ukraine . 
  and i get it , i 'm uncultred , fat & fucking retarded because i 'm american . 
  lol you think you 're the first to attack me & shit all over me just because of my nationality ? 
  but anyway , you wan na know the greatest threat to world balance , take a look at the russian border in ukraine or who 's trying to turn the south china sea into a personal lake , not a bunch of people off the street , especially it many of those people are from countries who have n't seen or been threatened by war for as long as they lived thanks to a american security umbrella . 
  when you have ukraine now as one of the most anti-russian countries in the world & vietnam one of the most pro-american countries in the world , that should serve as a wake-up call . 
  and during the last 15 years , the united states has supported the euro 's introuction , helped support european banks during the great recession & helped bail out european governments through the imf . 
  it helped extend military protection to eastern europe & through it helped push eastern europe into the eu . 
  it stood by & even at times compensated for the eu over russian agrression against ukraine & eu interests . 
  ** as for how bullied you are , where was europe in vietnam if you 're puppets ? 
  where was most of europe in iraq ? 
  hell , america only got involved in libya because europe basically pushed us into it , obama was reluctant as shit . 
  ** so do n't give me that oppressed bullshit . 
  lol the united states helped forge the european union . 
  it 's helped protect europe . 
  it 's helped economically prop up europe . 
  not over years , not over just decades , but over literal generations . 
  and not in the distant past , but all the way up until recently into the new millenium . 
  ** so stop avoiding my question , and explain just how the fuck is europe oppressed by america ? 
  because , from where i 'm sitting , it looks like you 're rather independent , prosperous , stable & in control of your own destiny , thanks in large part to the legacy '' * american imperialism * '' . 
  ** to despise the effect of * `` american imperialism '' * on europe is to despise the european integration it pushed , the european stability it helped ensured & the european prosperity it helped encourage . 
  not just in 1949 , but in 1959 , 1969 , 1979 , 1989 , 1999 & 2009 too . 
  you wan na talk about the domination of american imperialism & puppetry of european governments , well , lol , under what circumstance do you think modern europe was forged ? 
   it is wonderful finally seeing the emergence of a real europe that is throwing off the yoke of us oppression . 
  yo , i oppose trump , hope he get 's impeached , damn well shed a tear on election day , but wtf ? 
  like ... wtf ? 
  we ... we helped re-build the continent , economically prop it up & militarily defend it ... ** for more than half-a-century ** ... we backed economic , military & political integration ... we funded european federalists & the eu 's predecessor organizations ... we brushed aside french , british & italian opposition to german re-unification to help basically force it through . 
  we helped flood eastern europe with foreign aid after the wall came down , moved to expand nato to protect them & diplomatically pushed them to integrate furthur with western europe . 
  we helped support the euro 's introduction , diverted funds from our great recession bailout through a back door to provide emergency liquidity to european banks , helped bailout european goverments afterwards through the imf & went toe-to-toe with russia over ukraine after the eu basically became paralyzed by infighting for a month or two . 
  under american hegemony , europe rebuilt to once again become one of the wealthiest regions in the world . 
  under american hegemony , europe undertook unprecedented integration . 
  under american hegemony , europe can , and has , opposed us on things they disagreed with , from vietnam to iraq to trump 's bullshit . 
  ** so just how in the hell are you oppressed ?
