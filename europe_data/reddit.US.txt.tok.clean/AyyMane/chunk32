  how have we oppressed you ? 
  we basically built you into what you are today , drove it , and you 've had the freedom to tell us to fuck off . 
  america has added fuel to the fire , but drawing random lines on a map , setting up unnatural artificial constructs to govern those lines in a colonial contexr & then immediately fucking off with little continued support to those constructs really fucked the region dude . 
  i mean , you can blame america for everything bad that 's happened all you want , but america got there * after * europe had already shit the bed & lit a dumpster fire , forced to work with the people & variables directly spawned by that . 
  one of the reasons al-qaeda was founded was to overthrow the saud monarchy . 
  the monarchy choosing the americans to defend saudi arabia against saddam 's armored legions instead of his rag-tag band of musketeers , and thus allowing the military boots of christians to march across the muslim holy land , absolutely infuriated him . 
  shoes for a more civilized age . 
  i 've been told that if russia ever invaded , sweden would fight until the last finn .

  very true , but tbf , we still have to deal with places like mississippi & arkansas ourselves . 
  for r&d , but they 're still a couple miles or more behind in venture capital . 
  and tbf , california when compared alone would look ridiculos , and i 'd wager texas & new york ar n't looking too bad either . 
  one could argue that it 's even greedier to risk less , but demand more , as is the mentality many seem to have when comparing american & european tech companies . 
   at the same time europe has mentality problems , that 's why they ban uber left and right and then they wonder `` why such companies can not take off in europe '' duh ... that 's one of the mentality problems , but it 's not the only one & not even the biggest one in my opinion . 
  from what i 've seen , the biggest problem is simply european investors ' fear of risk . 
  in general , american investors seem to like to gamble on new industries & almost see failure as a kinda badge of honor , while european investors come across as the exact opposite . 
  they seem to prefer the safest investments in the most proven industries , and view failure like a death sentence . 
  this has crippled european venture capital & start-up potential more than anything else in my opinion . 
  because , i mean , the money is there , the research universities are there , but the risk-taking just is n't . 
  the eu has a bigger economy & more consumers than america . 
  but in every regard , whether talking about gdp percentage , per capita or absolute figures , america still outspends the eu in both ventute capital & development research . 
   that does n't strike me as accurate at least when compared to the us . 
  it should n't . 
  as a proportion of it 's gdp , america risks about 4x as much on venture capital for start-ups than the eu . 
  per capita , it risks about 8x as much . 
  overall in absolute dollar terms , it risks about 5x as much . 
  the picture for r&d spending is n't much better . 
  [ ** i detailed it here . 
  ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6cmzp8/europe_isnt_the_new_silicon_valley_its_better/dhw5811 ) i honestly do n't know how they could imply it 's easier to get funding in europe than america with a striaght face . 
  lol not many things are so completely wrong in every way . 
  guys , i get it . 
  this is a * `` yurop stronk '' * moment , and by all means , i encourage you to build upon your tech industry & seriously compete with us . 
  but you 've barely even gotten off the starting line , yet you 're * already * declaring yourself * better * than us ?

  lol so i 'd advise you hold your horses & tone down the pre-mature bragging for a minute . 
  tbf , if france gets on board , it 'd completely change the equation because of their influence in nato & eu , which would be two of america 's biggest concerns in such a scenario , but i just do n't see them doing it . 
  lol u.s. would n't let that shit slip . 
  it 'd infuriate a nato ally , alienate the eu & give regional momentum to the break-up of the uk . 
  we do n't want shit to do with any of that . 
  russia would probably be the only unsc member to support it , as china would n't want to alienate the eu either & is probably weary about giving the west grounds to poke back over taiwan and tibet , like you mentioned .

  idk how you fix that though . 
  i think it 's more of a cultural thing than a economic thing to be real .

  who was in the driver seat ? 
  marshall plan , german debt forgiveness , eastern european foreign aid , politically backing economic integration on the continent , helping with the euro 's introduction , backdoor stimulus during the great recession from our own bailout , imf contributions , etc. 
  plus , you know , helping defend your capitalist prosperity during the cold war from that whole communist thing ... 
  but no , yeah , i fully expect you to not want us to hep us at all & instead cheer for our destruction if shit goes bad on our side of the atlantic . 
  i 've come to expect that from you . 
  lol, 
  notice how you can whine & call me names , but ca n't give me a counter-argument ? 
  lol, 
  there would n't of even been a western-derived germany or eu without america though , that 's my point . 
  we economically propped up , politically supported & militarily protected both . 
  both were fostered & grew under american hegemony . 
  an that 's not me taking credit for shit we did n't do . 
  that set-up & result was , quite literally , our grand strategy in europe & geopolitical goal . 
  oh , no , i burst your bubble & reminded you of your own history . 
  lol how sad . 
  far back ? 
  it literally stretches from the end of wwii to the present era in a unbroken pattern . 
  lol, 
  well , we did flood you with foreign aid when the wall came down & push for you to join nato * ( lol who 's the big deterrant against russia there dude ) * . 
  and west germany was re-built with the marshall plan , defended with american soldiers , had much of it 's debt forgiven by the american government and then had continental opposition to it 's re-unification with east germany basically overridden & forced through by america . 
  you also joined the eu ... which was started by eu federalists who were also helped by cia funding & state department political support , and which in itself grew under american hegemony . 
  wow ... i guess the big , ugly american might not be as fucking stupid & worthless to the enlightened european as originally presumed ... 
  and economic support . 
  you know ... both the eu & us being liberal democracies who 's economies are based around free market economics ... compared to countries like russia & china ... whom are both illiberal regimes with economies driven by state capitalism ... plus ... therr 's that whole thing with the eu & it 's predecessors in themselves being fostered under american hegemony with american support backing them from the very start ... 
  fuck all ? 
  lol the cia literally funded eu federalists , the state department backed integration every chance it got , the american military literally garrisonned the iron curtain & the american government literally funded the re-building of europe with the marshall plan . 
  the center-piece of the eu , germany , only exists as it does today because of america . 
  even ignoring the marshall plan , we forgave their debt , held the fulda gap & overrode european objection to basically force though unification . 
  we helped support the euro 's introduction & help prop up european banks during the great recession through backdoor stimulus from our own bailout . 
  we 're the biggest contributor to the imf & it 's bailouts . 
  we 've done more for europe as a whole than your country has done alone . 
  you do n't even know your own history man . 
  lol i mean , shit , why do you think your ass is speaking english * right now * ? 
  lmao they 're so insecure . 
  since the end of wwii we helped make them what they are today . 
  from the political to the economic , we helped guide & protect them . 
  but all they do now is pray for our downfall & disintegration after we pulled them up & helped them integrate . 
  no wonder trump 's dumbass got so many votes for playing on american anger over that . 
  ** are you fucking serious ? 
  ** for more than half-a-century helped guide your political integration . 
  we economocally supported & militarily protected the entire continent . 
  and now , what ? 
  you 're cheering for us to break up ? 
  you would n't be shit without us . 
  try to rewrite history if you want , but the truth is , your liberal democratic free-market based economies , the neo-liberal union you find yourself under , it 's all the direction american hegemony pushed you in , upheld & cemented . 
  wtf do you get off praying for our destruction when we helped gurantee your independent prosperity yuh petty bitch ? 
  we fucking built you dude . 
  lol helped fund your re-construction , helped push your integration & protected you in the whole time . 
  economically propped you up & politically supported you for more than a half-a-century . 
  you 're basically our son . 
  i. ... disagree . 
  everything should be in english . 
  including french . 
  ** edit : ** guys , it was a joke .
