  at least with guantanamo they 're * actually foreign combatants from a warzone/active conflict area . 
  * and if they 're citizens , they wo n't even go to guantanamo , they 'd go to court . 
  the problem with guantanamo is that ... they 're in this weird grey area . 
  they were captured in a warzone or active conflict area , but they 're non-uniformed & belong to illegitimate organizations that have used terrorist tactics , so they ca n't be held like pows until a wars over or a trade takes place , and it 's hard to try them because proving beyond a reasonable doubt they 're guilty in a chaotic warzone on the other-side of the globe is hard , especially on * specific * charges , and no other country wants to take them , so you 're kinda just ... stuck with them ... 
  i do believe guantanamo should be closed & all of them given trials . 
  if nothing sticks , fuck it , let them go back out to where-ever they came from to try again . 
  ca n't kill them , ca n't hold them forever , and i 'm sure some of them are actually innocent or at least repentant .

  * wwi, 
  talk about the two most pissed off marines to get that job assignment ... lol, 
   you 're a swede , you 're not even in nato !, 
  i do n't know why , but the way you threw that on there at the end had me crackin ' up so hard . 
  lol i said something related yesterday , how the finnish & swedes are some sneaky bastards who somehow managed to gurantee the protection of nato without any of the responsibility of actually * being * in nato . 
  meh , maybe it was over the line and i do apologize for that , but i meant more in a informal/nonchalant way than anything ... but i get your point . . 
  well , no , they 're just criminals who commit terrorism . 
  since it 's in france & not a active warzone . 
  but , once again , it 's not like they were n't aiming for french , dutch & other european citizens either . 
  their body count was about to get a lot bigger than ours if it was n't for those marines . 
  why yes i am . 
  lol always wondered if text would give it away . 
  it 's the vibe man . 
  you 're just pointing out islam ... without none of the socio-political & secular affairs context , which we 've been involved in one-way-or-another , for better or worse , when talking about the countries or regions a lot of these people are from ... 
  the majority of muslims from there ar n't like this , and the majority of muslims ar n't even * from there * . 
  and i did n't say gas chamber or nazi , but discriminatory with blanket statements that do n't take anything else into consideration ? 
  yes . 
  shit happens man . 
  the vast , vast majority of them are still * french citizens * whom are muslims . 
  if you care about nato and our allies you should actually respect their citizens & the people that fight for those countries . 
  i would expect nothing less when asking a foreigner something similiar in regards to american-muslim citizens & servicemen . 
  man we ai n't got nowhere to stand when it comes to our crime rate & psychos here . 
  stop trying to peddle this shit into a ulterior agenda or some shit . 
  and there ai n't a damn thing wrong with islam either . 
  i know way to many good muslim americans & have heard about way to many good muslim servicemen to hear that implied shit . 
  ah shut up man and stop being such a asshole . 
  we 've been heavily involved in mainly muslim countries as of late , so * of course * people from those countries are going to be the first to trip , but shit man , i know too many good muslim-americans for this emotional populist shit to take hold of the conversation . 
  i do n't like this logic , especially when we have muslim marines , soldiers , sailors & airmen who are putting their lives on the line for this country . 
  a lot of fuckers dying near the border because of cartels , and a lot of dead black people because of history & poverty , but i 'm not about to start implying a demonization of mexico or black people . 
  please no . 
  we only just stopped being the soviet galactic nazi empire a year or so ago . 
  people hate on season 2 because it 's a little slower and focuses more on the * `` working man '' * than the drug dealers on the streets , but it 's such a important season that acts as a sorta lynch-pin for the entire series in relation to baltimore 's workings . 
  you do n't really appreciate it until you 've seen the whole series & understand that the show is n't really about any one person or group in particular , but the entire city in itself . 
  also another reason to love the wire , great rewatchability . 
  lol, 
  sweden & finland are some sneaky fucks no-offense . 
  they 've somehow managed to gurantee nato protection without any of the responsibility of actually being in nato . 
  if i was swedish or finnish i 'd stay keep the status quo , but as a american , all i can say is fucking join already . 
  lol, 
  * narrows eyes * you frenchies stay out of our north american business now you hear . 
  keep your ass to africa . 
  i do n't know much about what the situation in southern europe is now , but god bless the italian navy regardless for helping innocent & desperate people . 
  if you disapprove , it 's not a point of voting , it 's a point of the eu . 
  you 'll vote , but the eu will negotiate . 
  if people do n't trust the eu than they should n't of agreed to closer economic integration . 
  you can have the rest , but you better keep your damn dirty palms off t-swizzle & the wap . 
  * rubs hands * good ... good ... let the english flow through you ... 
   this is the only known photo of him where he is identified in a public area . 
  do n't worry , reddit 's on the case . 
  we 've been on a roll ever since we identified that czechoslovakian terrorist in boston . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  we 've adopted both drake & the weeknd as our own after annexing toronto . 
  all your good jamz belong to us now . 
  shit , we even snatched bieber from ya 'll too . 
  lol, 
  yeah , despite his r&b background & new r&b / pop hybrid direction , bruh lives a pretty rockstar lifestyle . 
  one of the biggest * ( or at the very least , most successful & popular ) * pussy hound druggies in the music industry right now . 
  it was n't that long ago he got arrested in las vegas for punching a cop either . 
  lol, 
  yeah , but europeans & the chinese got the vast majority of oil contracts afterwards ... 
  you 're wrong . 
  their latest victim has been the weeknd . 
  ** god damn you max martin you swedish bastard !, 
  god damn you !!, 
  ** ^ ^ no , ^ ^ but ^ ^ seriously , ^ ^ i ^ ^ have ^ ^ really ^ ^ liked ^ ^ the ^ ^ weeknd 's ^ ^ latest ^ ^ shit . 
  ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ looking ^ ^ forward ^ ^ to ^ ^ his ^ ^ album ^ ^ later ^ ^ this ^ ^ month . 
  who tried to assert ownership over the english language ? 
  lol like ... do you even listen to yourself ? 
  well , my mom was adopted from a french woman after their biological daughter died so ... you know ... it might be those european genes that did me in ... 
  still have yet to see any of the statistics i asked for from him ... . all you 've done is insult me , tell me you do n't want to talk to me anymore & that i should go figure it out myself ... that 's ... not really facts ... 
  well , i do n't think he could 've done it with just machetes . 
   do n't be surprised when people do n't like you half as much as you always thought they did ( or should ) what the fuck does that even mean ? 
  lol i 'm not under the impression at all that you owe me shit , but i 'm also not under the impression that i deserve shit from you just because i 'm american . 
  what type of ignorant ass shit is that ? 
   you 've been living in an echo chamber that refused to acknowledge the rest of the planet 's existence for most of your damn life . 
  how do you figure that ? 
  you got on here bitching about american pop-culture , in english , on a american website . 
  that 's like me going on a hispanic website and bitching about people always talking about mexican soap operas & spanish pop stars . 
  like wtf ? 
  lol drop the superiority shit and the pretentious bitchiness . 
  this is what i 'm talking about . 
  what do i owe you ? 
  a apology for english-language american pop culture on a english-languaged american website ? 
  also , drake 's canadian . 
  alright , so where are they ? 
  and where have i been denying facts ? 
  well , i do n't disagree with you there . 
  touchy are we ? 
  lol, 
  yeah , and my grandfather was in that same war & lived through the depression . 
  fuck if i know what it 's like to live through a depression or be in a war though . 
  let alone use my grandfather 's experiences to win a personal argument , as if i understood his struggles after having grown up in a first-world , peaceful developed country .
