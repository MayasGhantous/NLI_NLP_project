   you mean the bottom comments where you said `` yurops can not take the bantz '' and a few of us had fun turning the `` bantz '' around ? 
  you said that ? 
  lol i did n't say or imply anything like that . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  seriously , * what the fuck * happened to you dude ? 
  you 're such a nationalistic prick who ca n't stop bringing america as a whole into this . 
  well , to be fair , i said this too :  not to mention the sounds , so many different regional sounds & styles . 
  you got your west coast g-funk , east coast boom-bap , dirty south trap , and so much more , with hybrids & cross-overs & everything . 
  and , hip-hop is n't entirely mainstream anymore than rock is . 
  it 's literally a huge , vast landscape of increasingly layered & varied music . 
  nor has part of it been in the mainstream for a long time , as it 's only been around a decade or so on that account . 
  so , on that note , excuse me if i continue to stand by the notion that there is * a fuckton * of diversity in hip-hop . 
  anybody who knows * even a little * about the genre would tell you the same . 
  it 's not a american thing , it 's a common-sense thing not defined by national boundaries . 
  any hip-hop fan , from poland to fucking china , will tell you the exact same and call you a fool if you say otherwise . 
  why is that hard for you to understand ? 
  music is n't defined , dominated & dictated on simplistic nationalism . 
  why are you having trouble with this concept ? 
  an , just to remind you , but the only one who made this about america was you . 
  lol you basically shit on a entire genre of music , implied all it 's artists were hacks , insulted all it 's fans & than centered it around america & how i 'm going all * '' ` murican on you '' * . 
  like wtf ? 
  lol i mean , shit , your only interactions with me have accusing me of having a superiority complex about my country , while continuously bringing up my country and making stereotyped insults , which i laughed at actually and played along with , hence my bacon-wrapped , cheesefilled burgers & corn-syrup . 
  i have n't said anything about belgium or europe in general on a serious not . 
  in fact , i quite directly implied hip-hop was a international institution earlier in this very same conversation . 
  the most i did was * make a personal shot at you * , and yes , i did ask you if a american rapper fucked your girlfriend , but not because i think i 'm superior because of my nationality , but because you seem to really , really fucking hate hip-hop , it 's artists & it 's fans , while constantly bringing america into the conversation & accusing me of being a dick because of my nationality . 
  like ... wtf gives man ? 
  lol what the fuck happened to you ? 
  * so please , create another account , post this thread there , and see what kind of reaction you get . 
  lol, 
  alright , post this there then . 
  if you think there ar n't hip-hop fans in that sub than you 're in for a very rude awakening . 
  lol good counter-argument by the way . 
   very detailed & intellectually refined . 
   ah , yes , emi/universal 18th century . 
  in more ways than one , yes . 
  booking & setting up operas take 's investment & connections * ( which comes with conditions ) * , being the personal musician for a wealthy group of noble patrons comes with constraints . 
   yes . 
  in one vid , the dude homoerotically boasts whilst women shake their asses in silver bikinis and in another , the dude homoerotically boasts whilst women shake their asses in green bikinis . 
  i find that no matter how far back in history you go , the vast majority of musicians still love sex , money & drugs . 
  they also like to lament about where they 're from & what it was like for them to grow up . 
  but seriously , you have so many forms of hip-hop . 
  sure , you got your gangsta rap , but you also got your political rap , your conscious rap , your trip-hop druggy shit , your religious shit , your interpersonal shit about love & the bedroom and what not , your lighthearted club shit , you know , like i said , it 's varied & layered in every which direction , and artists do n't just stay to one lane . 
  not to mention the sounds , so many different regional sounds & styles . 
  you got your west coast g-funk , east coast boom-bap , dirty south trap , and so much more , with hybrids & cross-overs & everything . 
  if you do n't realize that , or have n't taken the time to discover that , you 're either deaf or , more likely , ignorant * ( which makes the pretentiousness absolutely adorable lol ) * . 
   why would i , when it 's so much cooler to be a badass like halfdollar ? 
  did you hear about that time he capped that dude 's ass ( no homo ) ? 
  i heard a lot of things from the man . 
  he talked about where he grew up , what it was like growing up there , his struggles , his drive to escape poverty , the things he had to do to accomplish that , his relationships , love of women , how he liked to spend his money & ambitions for the future . 
  what 's your point ? 
  artists express themselves & relate their life experiences through music . 
  i 'm sorry if you do n't understand or appreciate that ? 
  lol, 
  was that why she did it ? 
  i prefer corn syrup . 
   and jesus fuck dude lmao did a american rapper fuck your girl or some shit ? 
   yeah , because there is no way your precious hip hop could ever be preformatted and specifically designed to sell by corporate interests . 
  as opposed to being preformatted and specifically designed to sell to the aristocracy ? 
  i mean , really , is that any more authentic than hip-hop which started on the streets ? 
  not to mention the fact that it 's still young enough to be in touch with it 's roots , or at the very least , still directly influenced by them . 
  i mean shit , it 's only been mainstream for around a decade to be real . 
   hahahahahahaha . 
  thanks , i can now justify buying an irony meter . 
   it 's now pretentious to not share a random ` murikan 's musical tastes . 
  no , but it is to sweep a entire genre of music like hip-hop , as layered & varied as it is , under the rug as pop bullshit , and then make it solely about american musical tastes when it 's a internationally popular & renowned thing . 
  you can drop the names of as many classical musicians as you want to sound * `` cultured & intellectual '' * , but your attitude and world-view betray your ignorance . 
  ah , do n't get offended now sweetie . 
  i have standards . 
  it 'd have to be wrapped in bacon & filled with the cheese first . 
   never , but neither did that figurehead . 
  his major , that 's another story . 
  well then , i guess we can sweep aside the accomplishments of most those classical musicians too . 
  because i mean , would they have even been able to do what they did , or achieve the fame that they did , if it was n't for their wealthy noble patrons ? 
   hip hop is about as `` culturally relevant '' as mcdonalds is culinarily relevant . 
  it 's pop for edgy teens , not the second coming of haydn . 
  the only thing thing that resembles a edgy teen more is you with that comment . 
  lol the attention-whoring contrarianism is palpable . 
  an i do n't know what 's worse about that comment , the pretentious * `` rap is crap '' * dickheaded-ness , or the fact it resembles so strongly the close-mindedness of what people were saying about * the beatles * & hendrix back in the late 60s . 
  now i 'm not saying it 'd be * the right thing to do * if we invaded italy & bombed sweden to help snoop , but i am saying it should n't be * off the table * . 
  snoop dogg is n't a b-tier rapper though . 
  he 's pretty much a living legend in hip-hop circles , who 's still putting out good & commercially-successful music , and even outside of that , he 's pretty well known among the mainstream ... hence why there 's so much publicity from this ... . 
   he 's probably just a fucking retard . 
  when was the last time you worked on , and put out , two landmark musical albums that acted as a foundation for an entire genre/sub-genre ? 
  or the last time you were worth $ 135 million dollars & managed to remain culturally relevant for a quarter-of-a-century ? 
  and managed to do all of it after coming from a shitty , gang-infested neighborhood ? 
  well , he 's worth about $ 135 million , so , in context , that 's like $ 200 to somebody worth around $ 60,000 . 
   he is either a complete moron , well , * the chronic * dropped when he was just 20 , and he put out * doggystyle * when he was just 21 , the two foundational albums of west coast hip-hop & g-funk * ( along with being two of the most essential albums in hip-hop in general ) * , not to mention , a quarter of a century later , he 's still worth about $ 135 million while remaining culturally relevant , and is still putting out albums which are good & commercially-successful ... so ... he ca n't be * that * stupid . 
  how the hell do you figure that ? 
  the cops followed & stopped him , he did n't track down the cops & flag them down . 
  they did n't even catch him with weed , or observe him smoking it , but they still dragged him down to the station anyway & made him piss in a cup . 
  so they got him on piss in a cup . 
  that 's it . 
  just piss in a cup . 
   ( i really do n't get what he 's done to earn his fame ) he worked on one of the most important hip-hop albums ever put out at 20 , and put out another essential hip-hop album at 21 . 
  he heralded in the era of g-funk and basically set the standard for west coast rap for decades to come . 
  he was a highly-respected & influential artist in a era where his contemporaries were tupac , biggie & nas . 
  if you ever considered yourself even * the tiniest fan of hip-hop * , you have to respect him for that & not diminish his accomplishments in that regard . 
  unless you 're just one of those pretentious * `` rap is crap '' * guys or a * `` real rap '' * backpacker , at which point it does n't matter what i say because you 're probably just a pretentious dickhead . 
  lol, 
  based on * experience * is a funny way to describe the antiquated mess we have on our hands here .
