  i mean , i 'm not even allowed to keep a hummingbird as a pet without a permit ? 
  bird law in this country is simply not governed by reason !, 
  but as * we are * talking about this in the context sweden , i do n't think i 'd be wrong to say that * acquis communautaire expelliarmus napoleonorum * should be the established precedent , and rightly so for that matter . 
  no hard feelings though . 
  we 're both men of the law . 
  you know . 
  we get after it . 
  we jabber jaw , we go tit for tat , we have our little differences . 
  but at the end of the day , you win some , i win some , and there 's a mutual respect left over between us . 
  it 's clear we 're both well-versed in matters of lawyering here , so how about we go toe-to-toe on bird law & see who comes out the victor to settle this ? 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about , but that dope dealer deserves everything the court can throw at him . 
  sure , they did n't catch him actually having weed , or observe him actually smoking weed , but he could 've three weeks ago in a completely different country where it 's legal , and is n't that enough ? 
  well , no , but they can be looking at your bob marley shirt , or your dreadlocks , or your psychedlic-colored necklace , or hear the music you 're listening to which might be stoner bands/rappers * ( and ... i mean ... that 's a lot of different & famous bands & rappers ) * . 
  the instagram example was more for if you live in a small-town or are within a cop 's personal circle * ( who has more cops in his personal circle which might be able to view your online posts ) * , or if you 're going through your phone in front of him and he catches it , even if you only had it up on accident . 
  i mean ... you can literally not have weed , or be caught smoking weed , but because you smoked a joint three weeks ago , even if it was in a country or state where it was legal ... * you can still get fucked up because of the above * ... . 
  i. . . i feel as if i 'm taking crazy pills here when trying to explain how this type of system can be bad ... . 
  well , in snoop 's case i mean ... he 's a international celebrity who 's known to smoke pot ... so i mean ... even though they did n't catch him with anything , or witness him smoking in sweden , that was their cause i would assume . 
  but for normal people it can be because you have dreadlocks , a bob marley shirt , psychedelic colored apparel/accessories , listen to stoner music , have facebook/instagram/twitter / phone pics of you smoking in another country where it 's legal , or simply taking pics of being at a coffeeshop or cannabis store in those countries , or because you 're tired , or your eyes are red & a little irritated , or shit man ... . there 's a lot of reasons that can fuck you over having taken a substance that does n't leave your system in a month even if you have n't touched or did it since ... i mean a cop might just be annoyed at you & know he can jam you up over some shit , even if he did n't catch you with the shit or observe you doing the shit ... 
  i 'm ... i 'm not crazy here guys , right ? 
  this is a stupid precedent & system , right ? 
  yeah , but , when it comes to weed , you could 've only smoked a joint three weeks ago , in a country or state where it 's legal like the netherlands or colorado , while not having had any since , and * still be fucked * if you get drug-tested in sweden . 
  thc stays in your system * for a month . 
  * even if snoop * ( hypothetically speaking ) * only smoked a joint 3 weeks ago at a coffee shop in the netherlands or somewhere in colorado , he 'd still be fucked . 
  lol, 
  well , they 're one of the few democratic & secular nations in the middle east with a * real * national foundation . 
  not to mention they have the largest economy & most powerful military in the middle east , along with being one of the most populous countries there as well . 
  so it gots all that going for it too ... 
  before this thread really starts to get riled up , i 'm going to preemptively point out that the kurds are not under some united , monolithic organization . 
  there are large differences between turkey 's pkk & hdp * ( note : as in , these two have huge differences with each other as well ) * , syria 's ypg and iran 's pjak . 
  the only kurdish groups really united are the kdp & puk through iraq 's krg , but , once again , they have huge differences with the other kurdish groups . 
  for example , america has a strong alliance with the kdp/puk * ( peshmerga ) * & a good working relationship with the ypg , but we 've opposed pkk since the 80s , and the cia even helped the turkish government capture it 's leadership in the 90s . 
  hell , iraqi kurdistan 's president , barzani , has even given his blessing , or to put it more accurately , his acceptance of , turkey bombing the pkk . 
  and , while we 're on the subject of the pkk , it 's important to keep in mind ** they actually use terrorist tactics ** . 
  i 'll quote a [ relevant / r/worldnews post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3enbh1/the_white_house_has_backed_turkeys_right_to_take/ctgt05w ) to drive this home a little more :  about the pkk , here 's some shit they 've done .

  ** hell , iraqi kurdistan 's president , barzani , even gave his blessing , or at the very least , acceptance of , turkey bombing the pkk . 
  also , if you want a independent kurdistan , * fine * , but just do n't bitch about it when it becomes a neo-israel . 
  lol i love how the hivemind lost it 's shit when america said kurdistan should remain apart of iraq , but do n't understand the opposite of that is the same logic which created present-day israel who the hivemind hates because ... it 's a ethnic-based country who has problems with most it 's neighbors ... shit 's all great & good until the government begins carving out land from their neighbors * ( syria , iran & turkey ) * & starts to pass policies which exclusively benefit ethnic kurds . 
  and then , after it 's all said and done , when the populist bullshit makes it happen , and we become allies to a independent kurdistan because they 're the best & most reliable option out of a shitty bunch ... you can hate us for that too ... . . 
  how ? 
   how 's the un ? 
  well ... there has n't been a third world war ... so we got that going for us ...  how 's the suez canal doing ? 
  well , a nuclear war did n't start over it , colonial empires did n't pop back up and we have no problem using it , nor have we for the longest time now ... so ... pretty good ... .  how is the territory we leased to you for 99 years in the indian ocean in order for you to do the lend lease act ? 
  well , considering the fact you still use it & benefit from it ... pretty good ? 
   you humiliated and embarrassed us at our most vulnerable time and your government backs argentina when it comes to the falklands . 
  by giving you intelligence , crucial air-defense missiles & offering up a free carrier if you needed it ? 
  i do n't know if that 's embarrassing , but i do know it 's a fuckton more than what your fellow european & commonwealth allies did . 
   built an institution specifically to destroy empires ( un ) what a terrible , terrible thing to do in the face of colonial empires . 
   stopped the uk acting independently on the world stage ( suez crisis ) and many more . 
  i 'm sorry for avoiding a nuclear war with the soviet union , where europe would be the battleground , by stopping you from trying to reestablish a colonial empire ? 
  no , it does n't . 
  lol and it 's pretty damn petty for you to stereotype like that . 
  i mean , you can disagree or dislike me , and there 's probably a number of things that you could justifiably disagree or dislike about me for , but that 's just not one of them . 
  that 's just some pretentious bullshit . 
  lol, 
  the eagle of freedom has heard you brother . 
  am i supposed to pretend we did n't do that & white-wash history ? 
  is it wrong ? 
  one dude stabbed a kid over being knifed in counter-strike . 
  so you 're in good company . 
  thank you . 
  it 's one thread ? 
  and yes , as far as this goes , * we have more to offer * . 
  thus the others benefit more , specifically because of our larger influence & power , both soft & hard . 
  not bringing that up in a discussion about this is like not bringing up wealth when talking about economics . 
   though it 's pretty funny how you 're constantly mentioning how powerful the us is . 
  compared to the rest of the anglosphere ? 
  we fucking dwarf all of them combined .
