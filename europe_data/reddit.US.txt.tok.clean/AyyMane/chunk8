  lol that 's not even like ... disputed ... in fact ... it 's utterly obvious ... and it 's pretty well agreed upon that we 're the most influential country in the world ... . which is a whole different league from the anglosphere in itself ... and i mean ... i. . . did answer your question ... if you 're a mid-level drug dealer ... and you make a alliance with me ... a columbia n supplier ... that 's better for you even if it benefits me ... 
  i. . . i do n't know how much more clear i can make this ... are you just like ... blindly ignoring reality and replacing it with your own fantasy version ? 
  ya 'll just seriously upvoted somebody who implied america was a bastard , who nobody wanted assistance from , for helping deal with nazi europe , rebuilding post-war europe & committing to western europe 's defense at the height of * stalin 's * iron curtain . 
  for helping , encouraging & protecting the very foundations , predecessor organizations & present-day form of the european union . 
  ** ya 'll are a bunch of fucking geniuses . 
  lol **, 
  how do they benefit more from getting intel from , and not being spied on , by the the world 's most powerful & influential country whom has some of , if not * the * best access to intelligence & most efficient means of gathering intelligence ? 
  wow ... i take it you 're not a regular in / r/commonsense ... 
  china is n't on the list of current or future problems for the united kingdom . 
  * unless * the united kingdom begins to seriously try & revive a deeply-integrated commonwealth under it 's leadership , independent of the united states , like op suggested . 
  the only reason we 're at heads with china is because of the alliances & game of influence we have in the region ... the uk is n't entwined in that ... unless the above happens ... 
  no , we benefit , lol , but the other members benefit more . 
  i 've never said we act out of pure charity and altruism , do n't be a fool or try misrepresent me . 
  and do n't act like those countries act out of altruism or charity either . 
  it 's just common sense . 
  the power dynamics of the situation clearly point out who has more to offer , and it 's not new zealand . 
  what ? 
  that the most powerful & influential country in the world sharing a fuckton of it 's intel & agreeing to not spy on a country who 's a ocean away with 1/5th it 's population , 1/8th it 's economic size and 1/40th it 's size , is n't a stupidly amazing deal for the smaller country ? 
  it was hyperbole , but the significance of the literal fuckton of intel we give to five eyes , along with it being the only real no-spy alliance we have , is rather undeniable . 
  yeah man , germany was basically on it 's knees & lend-lease did n't help the allies at all at the beginning of 1942 . 
  britain was basically in clear waters by this point . 
  i 'm sure another couple years of the most devastating war in history , with the iron curtain extending over the netherlands , if not beyond , under stalin would 've been much more preferable . 
  or hell , who knows , maybe even under hitler with no italy/d-day , american naval convoys or lend-lease to worry about . 
  because really , is that not really what matters here ? 
  the fact that america is a big , bad bastardman ? 
  the dutch soviet republic or greater german reich would 've , honestly , been the better solution here . 
  and your last point would be relevant if the eu did n't drag us into both mali & libya already with france being the most adamant country about bombing assad . 
  ** edit : ** and yeah , we used nazi collaborators to get to the moon , but it 's better than using them to try & re-conquer indonesia . 
  the fact that everytime obama or kerry compliments france or makes a off-the-cuff remark about our intertwined history , the british media explodes in sensationalist bullshit & british internet users begin going off on passive-aggressive rants , actually , in my opinion , signals that the * `` special relationship '' * is very much alive . 
  it 's also just god damn hilarious . 
  lol, 
  simple : * `` hey , i see you 're now the most powerful & influential country in the world who everybody has to do business with , can you please share all your intel with me ? 
  yeah , because the united kingdom can economically & militarily prop up australia/new zealand against china by itself & canada against russia by itself . 
  especially when it involves purposefully excluding the largest , most powerful & by far the most influential anglosphere nation ... who is smack-dab in the middle of the uk & all those countries ... while the uk simultaneously isolates itself from europe in the process . 
  or ... are you talking about the ... commonwealth * commonwealth * ... because ... to be honest dude ... i do n't think india , south africa & indonesia are down for * round 2 * to be honest ... . 
  i forgot . 
  the united kingdom & western europe did n't want any of that money , protection & encouragement for peaceful integration over the past 70 years . 
  hell , i know eastern europe did n't want any of it over the past two decades either . 
  no european countries asked or lobbied for any of that . 
  we forced all of that on you guys . 
  i forgot . 
  my apologies . 
  i mean , shit , lol , for a second there i was under the impression that the whole reason this entire chain-of-events even got started in the first place was because your country was begging us for help when you were in your darkest hour . 
  except when you pushed us into libya , or needed intelligence , missiles & a potential replacement carrier during the falklands , or wanted into five eyes , or needed help during the two most dangerous wars in your country 's history , or money rebuilding afterwards through the marshall plan , or protection through nato after that through-out the cold war . 
  not to mention the absolutely huge cultural & economic benefits that come with a strong alliance to the most powerful anglosphere nation * ( by a ridiculously huge margin ) * . 
  but no , hate us because we pushed you to integrate with the continent for a peaceful & stable europe . 
  i mean , shit , i remember pretty clearly when we forced you guys into vietnam & did n't explicitly wait on commons to vote on syria/assad . 
  was n't the imf the first to admit they made mistakes with the way austerity was implemented and the one who has been pushing hardest for debt forgiveness ? 
  as far as partners go , why would greece want to burn that relationship completely ? 
  *** edit : *** * in reference to everything i 've been watching happen & the populist notions which define them , from the brexit , to the grexit , to full-fledged fiscal integration , the defense situation in eastern europe , to the sentiment that europe should cut ties with us or that all the good we 've done over the past decades does n't matter since it benefited us & was in our interests * for seventy years we 've thrown our economic , military & diplomatic weight behind european integration . 
  from the marshall plan , to nato protecting the eu 's predecessor organizations * ( who we economically supported & diplomatically backed ) * , to propping up the euro during it 's introduction , the fuckton of liquidity diverted to european banks during the great recession & our contributions afterwards to the bailouts with the imf . 
  we 've had to exhaust diplomatic pressure to influence the british to slowly abandon their island mentality & integrate with the continent , to convince the french to become more palpable to german reunification and , most recently , to convince the germans to lighten up on the greek negotiations . 
  countless american lives , countless american dollars & countless american man-hours have been put on the line for this * `` european project '' * shit for the better part of a century . 
  and yes , it 's been all in our interests , it 's all benefited us , but it 's benefited all of you guys too , i 'll be damned if all that good is swept under the rug just because it was in our interests , while still being consistently reminded & condemned for all the bad . 
  you ca n't just point out the bad and act like all the good did n't happen . 
  that 's such a asshole thing to do . 
  ** tl ; dr you guys are all assholes . 
  we 've thrown all our weight behind european integration , we 've basically handed regional stability & peace to you guys on a golden platter , and all you want to do is piss on us and try to burn the shit down just for the fuck of it . 
  we control the united kingdom as much as you control switzerland . 
  besides , as much as a neo-german reich might get your dick hard , i do n't think it 's as good a idea as you think it is , as southern europe can attest too . 
  we used our influence to push your country together when france & britain opposed it , and we 'll use our influence to push britain & the eu together even as many of the elite in your country oppose it . 
  you 're both european . 
  deal with it & stop the dick-waving . 
  a divided europe and petty squabbling over who has regional hegemony is n't going to do anybody any good . 
  they were both shitty . 
  how do you do not understand this ? 
  you glorifying those fucks because of the opposition is just as bad as people justifying the junta because of the opposition . 
   but it 's just really ironic , in my opinion , that the question who 's answer so many people are mad about was asked by a government-funded public service , ** as opposed to a private corporation owned by a foreigner like murdoch . 
  i pretty clearly said what we did was terrible and we should be condemned for it . 
  i also said it should n't of happened and should 've been avoided . 
  but i mean , you know , i heard that stalin guy was a dick so i guess , by your logic , i 'd be justified in idolizing nazis ? 
  you see where i 'm getting at here ? 
  well , there was n't wide-spread & systematic rape or massacres in the first place , so eh , probably not . 
  i mean , lol , honestly i ca n't really see it having a effect on that at all . 
  the ones you hear about are isolated incidents which get a absolutely huge share of media attention , from reddit to hollywood . 
  though i would n't be surprised if it actually caused ** more problems ** , as having a friend tried by a foreign third-world country 's islamic-based courts riddled with what 's probably unfair bias * ( and corruption ) * immediately after a occupation & war , on trumped up bullshit charges , might cause some ... well ... unforseen problems ... 
  although i hear isis has a pretty strict islamic-based judicial system as well , much , much , much more so than iraq . 
  so i 'm sure , by your logic , if the finnish adapted many aspects of their system your country would be a moral paradise . 
   might have been worse for greece ? 
  i do n't think the junta should 've happened at all , what we did was horrible & i feel terrible about it , but when you idolize stalinists & titoists you 're a damn idiot & should feel really really bad about yourself . 
  because opposition to the junta is one thing , but cheerleading ideologues which have consistently been shown to be just as oppressive , murderous & authoritarian as military rule is a complete other thing . 
  especially when it colors your modern day perceptions to a significance degree . 
  and we did n't single-handily cause the greek civil war so you can fuck right off with that shit . 
  lol we responded & adapted to it in what was a chaotic post-war environment . 
  you ca n't blame us for every god damn thing that 's gone wrong in greece . 
  bush agreed to the referendum which asked the iraqi people whether the occupation should continue . 
  the iraqi people voted no . 
  the only way obama could 've stayed was if he agreed to a treaty that required american troops be tried by iraqi courts , something maliki would n't budge on , so i 'm glad he pulled us out in the context of that . 
  although he did try , hard , to find a compromise there iirc . 
  plus maliki was just a shitty , shitty leader . 
  he single-handily managed to destroy every pro-government alliance we made with sunni tribes & groups during the awakening councils , while also managing to piss off every major neighboring sunni country iraq had . 
  i never said greece thought stalin was a stand-up guy , only that the opposition at the time was riddled with stalinists & titoists who guided it 's ideology . 
  and are you under the impression that the opposition was n't being aided & manipulated by somebody more powerful than you ? 
  like i said , it was horrible what we did & we should be condemned for it , i just do n't understand why the other side is so idolized & sympathized with , leading to a present-day atmosphere of pro-russian , anti-american popular sentiment . 
   the iraqi 's also did n't invite them in , so what the iraqi 's want is not really decisive . 
  well , the iraqis ' did n't really have a say in the matter at the time , because saddam did n't run a democracy . 
  and when the iraqi people did , with a democratic mandate , ask us to end the occupation , we listened to them & respected their request . 
  we could 've stayed to a certain degree if we agreed to have our soldiers tried by iraqi courts . 
  i 'm glad obama pulled us out in the context of that . 
  doubly so in the context of maliki systematically destroying every relationship & pro-government alliance we had formed with sunni tribes & groups through the awakening councils , while also deciding it was a good idea to alienate every neighboring sunni country he had .
