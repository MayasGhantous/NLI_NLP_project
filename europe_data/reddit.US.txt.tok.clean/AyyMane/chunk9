  well , the way you phrased that is complete and utter bullshit . 
  and nobody laughed when they discovered the children in that van , in fact , they immediately moved to provide medical assistance despite coming under fire from surrounding buildings . 
  nor did they know that van had innocent people . 
  it just pulled into a active combat zone to interact with the same , from the perspective of the pilots , heavily armed non-uniformed militant group which just ambushed a american convoy . 
  i do n't think they should 've got permission to fire , and i do n't know who to blame more for that , the gunner who requested permission so adamantly or the guy who granted it without more information , and it 's absolutely fucking terrible what happened , but they did n't know it was a civilian driving that car and they sure as shit did n't know there were children in that car . 
  dude , stop trying to go against the narrative of britain being our lap-dog . 
  you were there man . 
  we told you to come and bitches ca n't say no . 
  british popular opinion has assured me that this is the case . 
  yes , that was my point sorry . 
  lol did n't mean to represent it otherwise , i just find it really ironic how many people tend to skip over things like that in favor of reactionary populism & revisionist history . 
  allies are supposed to disagree on certain things . 
  you did n't though . 
  you 're our lap-dog , so when we told you to come with all that useful malayan emergency experience in our time of need , you jumped right up and said * `` yes sir ! '' * . 
  stop trying to pretend you 're not our bitch or that history proves you 're not . 
  reactionary populism & historical revisionism ca n't be wrong . 
  i still do n't understand why the other-side is so idolized in greece when it was full of stalinists & titoists . 
  we deserve all the condemnation we get for supporting the junta ... but i never understand why so many greek people sympathize with the otherside and have evolved it into some sort of modern-day russian support/anti-american thing . 
  i mean ... once again ... what we did was horrible ... but the ideologies of neither stalin nor tito were very democratic , liberal things grounded in the idea of freedom & liberty . 
  in fact , i would say both of those ideologies revolved around quite the opposite in practice . 
  well , yeah , the second most-important anglosphere nation and our most important ally tends to help with influence . 
  but canada , ireland , australia & new zealand will also benefit greatly from another influential anglosphere nation in the eu , not just us . 
  joining a foreign military group , travelling to a active warzone & taking military action against us & our allies ? 
  yes , actually . 
  it 's called treason . 
  but it also does n't apply to this situation ... because it was a foreign military group , in a active warzone , waging military action against us & our allies . 
  americans also joined the german military during wwii . 
  by your logic the war should 've been paused so the fbi could be sent into the battle of the bulge to arrest any potential german soldiers with american citizenship . 
   the wikileaks leak on the july 2007 apache attack alone should make that point . 
  yeah , i know that video . 
  now let 's give some context to it . 
  those journalists were in * the most dangerous neighborhood * of * baghdad * at the * height of the iraqi war . 
  * the non-uniformed heavily-armed group they were with & surrounded by ** just ambushed a american convoy ** . 
  that 's actually why the apache was called in the first place . 
  so you have two journalists , surrounded by heavily-armed non-uniformed militants , who just ambushed & attacked american soldiers , in the most dangerous neighborhood of baghdad , at the height of the iraqi insurgency , carrying heavy camera equipment and pointing it around * ( a helicopter way up in the air ca n't really tell if it 's a weapon or not , especially when the same people are surrounded by people with actual weapons ) * . 
  and when american soldiers finally got to the scene a little afterwards , from the same unit as the one ambushed before , they were * immediately fired on by surrounded buildings . 
  * just to give you some idea of the situation on the ground there . 
  but now , do n't get wrong , it 's absolutely terrible what happened to them and i truly wish it did n't happen at all . 
  but at the same time , i think it 's also understandable under the circumstances , and justifiable accident in context of the situation . 
  although i never really did like assange after he spread edited copies of that video with the title * `` collateral murder '' * , as if they were purposefully & deliberately murdered with full prior knowledge of them being non-combatants . 
  oh no , i understand that , but it 's just really ironic , in my opinion , that the question who 's answer so many people are mad about was asked by a government-funded public service , as opposed to a private corporation owned by a foreigner like murdoch . 
  i mean , i would n't really mind either way , as that 's the point of news in general , but the context is just rather amusing given the direction many critics are coming from . 
  lol, 
  i understand that . 
  but i do find it rather amusing that so many british people on here are getting so pissy & telling obama to fuck off from their business , when it was a * public-owned * british media corporation that explicitly asked the question . 
  i just find it a bit ironic is all . 
  lol, 
  * `` alleged '' * is a weird way to describe somebody who plastered videos & pamphlets of himself declaring allegiance to said militant group & committing himself to jihad against us & our allies , while being in the middle of a active combat zone surrounded by same said militant group . 
  yeah , and remember when the british government jumped into vietnam at our beck & call ? 
  the bbc asked him a question , and he answered it . 
  the british should n't have their public-owned media ask questions they do n't want questions too if that 's the case . 
  maybe the reason it took shape the way it did , but i 've always been of the opinion that when you have strong-armed dictatorships who snuff out any other form of political or social opposition , making religion the only means of outlet for protest , you 're going to end up with religious extremists . 
  it 's really the one constant that has remained true independent of america , whether talking about dictators we 've supported , opposed , invaded or ignored . 
  well , we are talking about non-uniformed insurgents who use civilians as shields & have no qualms about using terrorist tactics , so i think context is important . 
  american citizens , in a warzone , who pledged allegiance to a foreign military group , which waging armed warfare against our government & allied governments , and whom have no qualms about using terrorist tactics to accomplish their goals , let alone being un-uniformed & using civilians as shields while they do so . 
  yeah because * we 're the ones * who offered ukraine that free trade agreement & road to eu membership that prompted russia in all of this . 
  ** oh fucking wait , no we did n't , we 're just picking up the pieces you abandoned following shit hitting the fan **, 
  how exactly was he a warmongering fuck though ? 
  the majority of conflicts he fought were defensive , not offensive . 
  if one was keeping score , it 'd be the rest of europe who came off as the greater warmonger , not napoleon . 
  so if you truly oppose warmongers , why do you cheer-lead the biggest ones of them all , instead of having some sympathy for the lesser of two evils ? 
   by conquering all of them for the large majority of the wars against him , that 's a weird way to say , * `` omg , the guy we just invaded and tried to conquer just straight up took half our shit !, 
  '' * with a army made up of individuals actually promoted on merit as opposed to nobility or wealth . 
   sent them on santo domingo ( haiti ) where they joined the rebels and stayed . 
  heh , i never knew that . 
  i mean , i knew about napoleon 's involvement in haiti , but not the polish soldiers staying . 
  thanks for that . 
   gon na look into it a little more . 
  and every time poland & napoleon are brought up , i ca n't help but be reminded of [ this excerpt ] ( http://www.napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/imperial_guard_cavalry_1.html ) about general wincenty krasinski & his men of the imperial guard 's polish lancers on the eve of napoleon 's initial abdication & exile :  ** charles parquin writes : ** general krasinski who commanded the polish lancers ... came forward with his officers . 
  as he took his leave of the emperor he uttered these words , which do the greatest credit to his nation : * `` sire , if you had mounted the throne of poland , you would have been killed upon it ; but the poles would have died at your feet to a man . 
  '' *  krasinki wearing his parade uniform announced to his lancers that * `` god has visited misfortune upon the emperor '' * and all began to weep . 
  they regreted they had not all been killed before hearing that anyone had dared demand napoleon 's abdication . 
  loud cries for vengeance were heard along with * `` vive l `` empereur !, 
  '' * sabers and lances were brandished and the cavalry moved toward fontainebleau . 
  they passed through nainville before sebastiani 's adc halted them . 
  yeah man and i 'm really happy i did go out of my way for this . 
  lol some of the most interesting history i 've read . 
  napoleon was kinda weird back in school . 
  we covered the french revolution pretty well & touched upon how he came to power some , but than we kinda just skipped to the war of 1812 after that , with only a couple mentions of napoleon here and there involving the louisiana purchase & haiti , as well as every now & then during following wars to give context on how the tactics there were influenced by him . 
  but god bless the internet though . 
  lol, 
  the united kingdom literally bank-rolled & participated in pretty much every offensive war against napoleon . 
  and in the context of russian serfs , bought british commissions & austrian hapsburg , yes , very meritocratic * for the time * . 
  it would be disingenuous to sit here and say that the napoleonic empire , underpinned by the ideals of the french revolution , was n't * much more * meritocratic than the british , prussian , russian & austrian empires in context . 
  i think the uk could 've very realistically gone broke or become overburdened by debt if it did n't slow down significantly in the event of loosing waterloo , especially in the context of america beginning to start shit across the atlantic and the general cost of maintaining one of the world 's largest colonial empire . 
  to be honest i 'm not really that knowledgeable outside of a layman 's understanding . 
  lol and after reading the comment you posted , you seem to be just as knowledgeable , if not likely more knowledgeable , than me on this regard , so i 'd feel uncomfortable answering your question in such a manner . 
  i would direct you to / r/askhistorians though for your question . 
  their [ archive & past threads ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/search?q=napoleon&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) on napoleon are a god damn gold mine in themselves for history lovers as well . 
  lol, 
  napoleon losing is what led to political fragmentation & numerous competitive powers in europe , which is the richest fuel for rampant nationalism & instability , which is the breeding ground for wars . 
  napoleon losing meant that the ideals of the french revolution , the virtues of a meritocratic social order , were dampened and condemned to hibernation . 
  napoleonic france was n't a barrier to modern western society , it was a precursor . 
  even with his defeat we still relate to the values of napoleonic france more than we do those who opposed napoleonic france at the time . 
  well , that 's what happened anyway . 
  and it 's what led to bismarkian-styled politics & world war i. 
   and you do n't educate me on the class system in my country . 
  i 'm not educating you , just reminding you , because you know exactly what i 'm talking about when i say that when the upper & mercantile-class dictated the foreign policy on napoleon , the early 19th century british public would follow regardless of how they felt personally . 
  you make it seem like they would rise up & revolt or something just to get their napoleonic crusade going . 
   also , the lower/middle class british people would not have liked being invaded by a foreign army .
