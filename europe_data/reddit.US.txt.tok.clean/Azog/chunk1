lookee here you boszomeg kurva , i have lived in your capital city for a year - i know more about your magyarul asses than you can imagine . 
  you on the other hand have not forked over any facts , just sentiments and assumptions . 
  so , in summation you can cane a great day and be welcome to be an asshat elsewhere , quisling . 
  how many conflicts has t-90 been in , how many have been destroyed as opposed to the combat history and the losses of m1a1s/merkava vs/leopard 2s ? 
  start with the facts that support ** your ** statement . 
  you have claimed that t-90 is as good as western tanks and that claim is your to prove . 
  you are following a wonderful tactic your former soviet masters taught you : troika shows up and says you are guilty and it is up to you to prove your innocence . 
  in the civilized world it is the way it should be - your claim , your burden of proof . 
  supply one reliable source confirming your statement . 
  you refuse because you know that you are wrong , russian shit is shit , plain and simple . 
  nobody but an armchair rear admiral such as yourself would make such a uneducated statement . 
  it seems that it is easier to squeeze a two meter pole into your ass than it is to squeeze a fact into your head : you made a claim , you should prove it . 
  that is how it works in the real world . 
  good job on stereotyping , now if you could do half a good job at being able to back the drivel you spew with fact you 'd be golden . 
  you did not link anything , you just made an asinine claim and then pulled a wikipedia link . 
  again , show me one reliable source saying that t-90 is comparable to any western mbt . 
  can you do that ? 
  jane 's ? 
  rand ? 
  anything ? 
  of course not . 
  instead you choose to fetishize the boot that stood at the neck of your people for half a century . 
  are you even hungarian ? 
   clearly i 'm the asshole here . 
  yes , yes you are . 
  you need to learn what the burden of proof is . 
  i have asked you what do you base your statements on , you did not provide sources . 
  to say that a t-90 is on par with any of the modern western mbts is plain ridiculous and i wanted to see if you can back such an extraordinary claim with extraordinary evidence . 
  you could not . 
  wikipedia is not a reliable source . 
  do you have any valid sources or are you pulling that retarded shit out of your ass ? 
  nah , do n't bother answering , i could care not less what some internet retard thinks . 
   as for sources , look them up if you want to . 
  i based them off my knowledge . 
  you made a statement hence the burden of proof is on you . 
   i consider this to be a tank capable of brawling western tanks . 
  any tank is capable of `` brawling western tanks '' , whether they will get themselves blown to smithereens is a whole different story . 
  i am glad to see that in ** your ** expert opinion a t-90 can take on abrams , leopard 2 or merkava 5 . 
  also , thank you for the sources . 
   their t-90 mbts are on-par with western mbts in term of performance . 
  what do you base this on ? 
  oh , but that is a whole another can of worms . 
  how would we go about that without ruining the companies themselves ? 
   `` this content is not available in your country '' german youtube is the worst when it comes to that . 
  i live in the netherlands so i do not have to deal with that kind of retardation . 
  i am skeptical about any suggestion re . 
  the internet coming out of germany . 
  russian ballet and music are heartbreakingly beautiful . 
  their classical writers are some of the best in the entire history and i absolutely adore their sacral architecture . 
  there is much much more to russia and her culture to be appreciated !, 
  yeah , let 's fuck up the internet . 
  everybody hates america , but everybody wants to be cool like america . 
  damn straight : republiek amsterdam !, 
  this is a failure of the local officials to protect the citizenry , whatever the reason behind might be . 
  the police should be present in the buses where loitering occurs and should act to deter , prevent and detain the troublemakers . 
  if someone starts a fight - arrest them and throw them in jail . 
  if someone spits on someone , arrest them and throw them in jail . 
  if there is someone littering , give them a ticket and if they fail to pay - arrest them and throw them in jail . 
  the failure of the local government is creating a fertile ground when something bad will happen down the road and there will be a mob setting the roma camp on fire while roma are still inside . 
  this whole problem is created by a few criminals and miscreants , but it has been exacerbated by the local authorities that are either incompetent or unwilling to solve the issue but most likely both . 
  the hague is where we sent the royals when we kept the title of the capitol . 
  how about `` squish '' ? 
  regardless of how or it happened , she is still his mother and her heart is torn out because of his death . 
  yeah , this is not going to happen . 
  ever . 
  what is that granny with the umbrella supposed to represent ? 
  he did unite germany for the first time . 
  bismarck , of course . 
  i have read it in german and was surprised by the colorful , understated descriptions he had for his friends and foes alike . 
  i have watched the events mentioned in the article and have found it very interesting to hear kohl 's unvarnished words about it . 
  such a wonderful putdown . 
  the man is the second greatest german chancellor . 
  you are entitled to your opinion and your teenage-sounding obnoxiousness . 
  wow !, 
  such an interesting read !, 
  kohl is the master of understated insult !, 
  wait , what now ? 
  i think that your translation was incorrect . 
  you are welcome to fantasize about the edwardian era and wax nostalgic for the imperial boot on your own neck . 
  look at the putin jr. here . 
  so you would exchange one master for another ? 
  damn hungary , you came below italy , france and spain . 
  what happened !, 
  damn !, 
  i remember `` oz '' covering the entire city back in the 90s !, 
  rip !!, 
  that is like saying that it is better to be a pile of vomit instead of being a pile of shit . 
  you are welcome to wallow in it , that is all you . 
  nor do we want to bomb you ever again , we would love to see you being a successfull eu country that is liberal and prosperous . 
  fool me once , wo n't fool me again . 
  i am glad to see that serbia is moving in the right direction , despite reactionaries trying to drag them back into the 90s ' style ignorance . 
  there is hope for them . 
  we did , at the tip of a tomahawk . 
  not much good can come out of somebody calling themselves `` shitcunt '' . 
  guess what greek : it already crashed and burned many , many times after codifying and practicing pederasty for centuries . 
  god forbid we have an opinion about the way some serbs treat gays . 
  i do not care about russian public . 
  ps : you really think your elections are selecting your leadership ? 
  that fool is getting ridiculous . 
  somebody needs to assassinate his short ass post haste .
