'' [ thick southern accent ] you call this a car ? 
  where i come from they call this a cry for help . '', 
  france is literally just minecraft but with french people instead of squidwards . 
  thank you , that 's interesting !, 
  that 's * amazing * ... 
  i wonder how much longer it took for ganesh to be invented , because i feel like a lot of his appeal is the statues of him . 
   ganesha emerged as a distinct deity in the 4th and 5th centuries ad oh shit , hmmmm ... man , i have stuff to read about tonight , that 's for sure . 
  capitalism . 
  i really liked hearing your perspective , thank you . 
  the working class in america have this weird thing where they vote right wing even if it means being hurt by their own decision . 
  it 's bonkers but there you go . 
  indeed . 
  in fact sometimes it 's even less obvious what the real causes were . 
  perhaps a drought years before you 're born causes your parents to move which puts you into a school where you 're bullied which leads you to take refuge in the school library where you discover x-men comics through a fellow student which leads you to conventions where you meet your wife . 
  [ these are fun i could do this all day ], 
  thanks for the perspective . 
  i guess we 're ok ( * i guess * ) as long as you 're right about the nukes . 
  fair enough . 
  no country where this bullshit right-wing wave of mutilation is in full swing is currently spending enough on education to stop it , and if we started now it would likely be too late . 
  [ god damn i 'm like 2 steps away from making a cardboard sign that says `` the end is nigh '' ], 
  i like this line of thought . 
  i would support it . 
  forgive me , i live in the us and we 're living through it here . 
  you are n't feeling it yet but you will if the sane people in the us ca n't contain this shit to our backwater continent . 
  edit :  the ` schools ' were teaching kids to hate other countries , they were instilling nationalism . 
  they are doing that here , now . 
  this is some well put , well needed perspective and i thank you for it . 
   i do n't feel better . 
  me neither . 
  especially since this time we 're the one 's shunning intellectuals and cultural pluralism and instead are pushing fundamentalist , nationalist agenda . 
  i do n't think i have to remind you that those guys lost last time . 
  well that sounds reasonable for a gut feeling if one can even say that ( lol ) . 
  there are a lot of factors at play actually , reminds me of the fact that climate change * did * have an impact on the current syrian crisis ( they had a massive drought that caused a huge population shift to the cities and caused a lot of turmoil/unrest in general ) . 
  honestly it 's a reminder that our individual lives and the lives of nations are influenced more by the random actions and consequences of actions of * other actors * than our own actions and their consequences ( unintended or otherwise ) , which is such a terrifying notion we tend to push it out of mind . 
  they will not , however . 
  no country on earth spends enough on education to stop this wave , we 're going to have to learn the lessons of the 20th century all over again the hard way . 
  up to and including nuclear weapons being used again . 
  i say this with no proof whatsoever so feel free to ignore this statement . 
  it 's pure opinion . 
  christianity 's role model is an anarcho-communist . 
  they should seize the means of production an institute a dictatorship of the proletariat . 
  [ [ pitty clap ] ] ( https://youtu.be/ddcymvaucra?t=27 ), 
   canceling the visit could jeopardize relations , as trump takes those types of actions very personally . 
  maybe he should have thought of that before he banned muslims ( that do n't associate w/his businesses ) . 
  no one expects th - ... [ sorry ], 
  oh no he 's triggered , guys , please give him a safe space to cry in, 
  we did , and you are right , you were . 
  the joke was in extremely poor taste . 
  that was part of it , in a way , so i ca n't take that back . 
  but i can say that war is a horrible , unholy thing , that can not be entered into lightly , but should be mocked as an idea . 
  also fuck nazis . 
   it still values free market capitalism not left e : enough e2 : for me e3 : i really appreciate your view on this , thank you !, 
  you can replace `` globalist '' with capitalist, 
  it was a joke but i mean , yeah , i can see why it would piss you off . 
  yeah but the economist ? 
  they 're a * strictly * capitalist publication , you ca n't get any more `` centrist '' or `` right leaning '' than that . 
  by definition it ca n't really even be `` left '' unless you 're in america right now because the left is basically just a butch of crybaby basic bitch bourgeois fucks . 
  well , britain has a history of appeasing nazis . 
  since when is `` the economist '' part of the left-wing press ? 
  what kind of drugs do you do , and where can i get some ? 
  we good, 
   both are still quite meaningless . 
  then ultimately we agree it 's * not * as simple as `` north/south '' . 
  i wo n't argue though , you 're right , it 's like the `` european '' thing , it 's not like that either but sorta . 
  thanks though , i appreciate the nuance . 
  please elaborate i like to learn . 
  i merely say it 's not homogeneous , is that incorrect ? 
  `` america '' is so enormous that saying `` americans '' is almost meaningless . 
  it 's like saying `` india '' , like ok yeah but which part of it ? 
  e : everyone in the world watches top gear , or did lol e2 : not as extreme as saying `` europeans '' as a catch all term , as though it meant something , but similar to that . 
  eat shit, 
   but there will be lots of cut backs and a move to an american style ` wild west ' economy . 
  yeah , what you are describing here is actually a disaster . 
  e : you should fully privatize healthcare too lol, 
   #also ukraine sorry , i think it aught to be larger, 
  that we are `` still having problems with russia . '', 
  crimea , hacking , influence in the new trump administration ( not talking about secret stuff , just the publicly known appointments ( tillerson ) ) . 
  everything we * do * know is enough . 
   `` you broke it , you pay for it mr. 
  no , like literally hash tag that shit , you 're 100 % right . 
  * that * is his language . 
  let 's just hope the actual people on the ground in europe ( not the generals in the pentagon ) have the strength of will to do the right thing , what ever that might be . 
  it 's that bad * in places * . 
  in many ways saying `` us people '' is like saying `` europeans '' or `` indians '' . 
  all these places are far too large and actually not homogeneous enough to generalize like that . 
  but in some places , yes , in america , some places have all but completely abandoned public education . 
   and icons oh god i just laughed so hard that i split in half and a slightly smaller , slightly differently decorated me came out , and then split in half and another one came out . 
  president richard hammond, 
   children 's shows the teletubbies should be more representative of the makeup of modern britain . 
  i suggest tinky winky be a member of isis . 
  if you keep this shit up we 're going to petition to change your name to little usa or america 2 : the little island that farted, 
   make deutschland great again !, 
  that 's my favorite part [ swoons ] . 
  no but despite the failure of the graph , my main reaction is `` man , what an * asshole * . '', 
  they knew exactly what they were doing . 
  are we living in the same universe ? 
  `` hold my treat '' -- versailles, 
  that 's metal as hell . 
  oh good point . 
  anyone see any virgins lately ?
