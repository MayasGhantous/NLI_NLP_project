they 're a city without having to support all the surrounding landscape 's infrastructure . 
  if you cut out a city from just about any western country you 'll see very high gdp per capita . 
  the difference is that those cities also support the rest of the country through taxes while luxembourg does n't . 
  he sounds like a guy doing an impression . 
  the entire world would be dragged into our media apocalypse . 
  also it would be called cursegate . 
  24-hour news networks are n't actually news anymore . 
  it 's talk shows and political opinion rambling . 
  withdraw from crimea , kick putin out on his ass , remove press restrictions . 
  it 's actually `` creating 10 jobs '' or something like that . 
  typically that just means building something and hiring some construction guys for a while , which could cost as little as $ 500,000 probably . 
  from what i can gather this is frank abernathy of efs investment partners llc , efs investment partners , llc , the law office of frank g. abernathy ; aka nobody https://www.linkedin.com/pub/frank-g-abernathy/8/685/6a6 http://spittalstreet.com/?p=7466  at the invitation of the kiev times and the american spiritual diplomacy foundation , a small delegation of native americans from the sioux nation , more specifically the lakota people , and native americans living in hawaii , recently arrived in kiev . 
  the sioux nation was represented by their chief , joseph brings plenty ; his son cole brings plenty ; and evelyne serais , a native of france now living in the united states , who has devoted her life in service to native americans . 
  kaiulani kahalekai , a princess and spiritual leader of native hawaiians flew directly from hawaii to kiev . 
  those representing native americans were joined in kiev by the leadership of the spiritual diplomacy foundation : messrs. mikhail morgulis , frank abernathy , and mark bazalev . 
  right . 
  he 's probably there fishing for an oil well construction contract . 
  carthage is long , long , long gone . 
  the romans made sure of that . 
  moreover they are n't the `` frontline '' heavy bomber anymore . 
  both the b-1 and the b-2 supersede it in that roll . 
  deaths not casualties , there would be a couple million more wounded and unable to fight . 
  my bookshelf was definitely a two person job . 
  because it 's a plot of land only large enough for a naval base with no resident cubans being subjected to a foreign government without consent . 
  crimea is more like the bay of pigs invasion . 
  a heinous act that rightfully receives skorn from all quarters but the partisan and hateful . 
  sounds exactly like the texas toll routes . 
  except texas gets federal interstate money to build and maintain good free highways . 
  usually only for large bridges that are hugely expensive to build and maintain ( particularly those over salt water ) . 
  there 's typically less direct routes for free . 
  having a lifting body means it would make a horribly dangerous car . 
  russian engine . 
  dude it 's teddy roosevelt and not even close . 
  * maybe * jumbo taft . 
  yes . 
  the previous secgen who just ended his term this month was even a dane . 
  we will take care of your kebab problem . 
  please send all your kebab to us . 
  we 'll handle it the same way as the taco influx . 
  not that i know of . 
  i assume there 's a process that designs have to go through where law enforcement approves the legibility of the license number , etc. 
  many states let you get a custom license number though . 
  the ones i posted are just the `` normal '' license plates for those states . 
  there are some that are sort of super bumper stickers though . 
  https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/online/elp/elp https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dmv/node/43491/ they basically require like a one-time ~ $ 50 donation to the cause they represent as well as the usual vehicle registration fees . 
  so in a way they are bumper stickers in that they are intended to deliver a message or support for something . 
  jarritos mandarin is the best `` orange '' soda http://www.jarritos.com/ also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ltbudbq8xw, 
  prohibition vietnam for actual physical things maybe the superconducting super collider . . which should still be made . 
  it would be like 50x the energy of lhc . 
  europe needs stylized license plates [ e ] ( http://www.plateshack.com/y2k/wyoming2/wy2013-2.jpg ) [ x ] ( http://www.plateshack.com/y2k/new_mexico/nm2011centennial.jpg ) [ a ] ( http://www.oregon.gov/odot/dmv/publishingimages/plates/plate_tree_lg.jpg ) [ m ] ( http://www.plateshack.com/y2k/hawaii/hi2002.jpg ) [ p ] ( http://www.scdmvonline.com/dmvnew/images/final%203m%20plate%20design%208-14-07.jpg ) [ l ] ( http://www.plateshack.com/y2k/oklahoma3/ok2011.jpg ) [ e ] ( http://www.plateshack.com/y2k/new_hampshire/nh2012.jpg ), 
  they 're basically just atms next to a driveway now . 
  they used to have cool pneumatic tubes so you could shoot stuff to the teller . 
  you would n't just be getting gas from the us . 
  the us plan is to sell lng on the open international market , it 's not the only country to do so . 
  nor is europe the only buyer . 
  japan has a large demand for lng since shutting off their nuclear power . 
  in the long term europe should rely be pushing for pipelines to the middle east , iran , and africa as well as developing their own supply . 
  they do n't need to understand it . 
  just say they 're practicing magic and witchcraft . 
  that 's what these nutters used to say about dnd . 
  first to step of saving face is removing one 's face from the woodchipper it 's currently in . 
  that 's what it is in most of the us . 
  if you do n't live in a neighborhood with lots of young children you do n't put in much effort . 
  it 's primarily a holiday for kids . 
  fuck the saints, 
  free speech card : aka it 's not illegal to say something this stupid . 
  assuming they know anything . 
  most of them do n't even speak the language . 
  try / r/askhistorians too , the day to day living of the past is precisely the kind of thing they 're good at answering, 
  cars are cheap . 
  car insurance is n't because liability also has to include potential medical costs . 
  buy a well cared for toyota . 
  you must pull out all stops to capture the pilot and put him on trial for espionage . 
  without the pilot they will just deny , deny , deny . 
  there was a russian empire before the soviet union . 
  putin definitely seems more tsar than comrade . 
  that you think a person ca n't choose to change how they are identified by moving to and immersing oneself in another culture is what 's tribal . 
  identity is not something you are born with either by heritage or by location of birth . 
  how tribal . 
  your university probably has had the address since prior to 2001 . 
  since then qualification for the domain has been reduced to only accredited post-secondary education institutes in the us and its territories . 
  existing sites were grandfathered in . 
  http://net.educause.edu/edudomain/show_faq.asp?code=edueligibility http://net.educause.edu/edudomain/policy.asp, 
  there is and there is n't . 
  there is a . us but it is n't used . 
  . gov , . edu . 
  . mil are us exclusive top level domains . 
  . com is also under control of the us but in a less restrictive and direct way nowadays . 
  this is a perk of creating the system in the first place . 
  see also : us+c anada international telephone prefix is 1 ; uk does n't have a country code for their stamps, 
  at this very moment the french navy is probably superior . 
  once the two fleet carriers for the royal navy are completed and armed with carrier wings it will probably retake its position as superior to the french navy . 
  china , india , and possibly japan will overtake both in the near future . 
  japan could do so pretty much in an instant ( in naval construction terms ) . 
  brazil is also a future naval power . 
  russia is a weird case in which their navy is really only a denial tool instead of a projection tool ( as well as a mad tool ) . 
  the science prizes are very legit . 
  the peace , economics , and literature are frequently political . 
  do n't you see , though , the uk had the right to strip the united states of its assets . 
  we should help them out some more then .
