  more like 52 % http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_regions_by_past_gdp_ ( ppp ) i suppose if you include india as part of uk it 's more . 
  regardless , japan , china , and russia are major economies outside of the traditional west . 
  firstly , almost all educational standards in the united states vary from state to state , with only relatively low national standards introduced fairly recently . 
  that said here 's what i remember for california : it 's taught from grades 3-10 ( ages 9-16ish ) . 
  in elementary school ( k-5 ) it was once a week for 45-60 minutes , in middle school ( 6-8 ) it was daily for about 50 minutes , and in high school ( 9-12 ) it was 2-3 times a week for 90 minutes for half the year ( basically a full period in a [ block schedule ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/block_scheduling ) ) . 
  the required curriculum covers a wide range of activities . 
  from what i remember there 's a standardized test of sorts for things like running a mile , flexed arm hangs , stretches which are not pass-fail but participation is required and results are recorded . 
  more generally it 's required to touch on a number of different types of activities : team sports , dancing type stuff , both indoor and outdoor sports . 
  basically a really quick survey of a wide variety of sports . 
  i do remember a few theory things . 
  some of it general health , some of it super basic kinesiology , some of it learning the rules of whatever sport we 're doing at the time . 
  in middle school and high school it 's a full class which counts towards your gpa . 
  getting a poor grade will get you in trouble , barred from student activities , etc. 
  high school graduation requires passing two years of pe . 
  that said , the grade is pretty much solely based on participation on effort , you 're not required to actually be physically fit or a great athlete in any way . 
  it goes somewhat without saying , however , that people who are n't physically fit will sometimes refuse to do things and then get a crappy grade . 
  i ca n't imagine any college cares about it in regards to admissions , except maybe , * maybe * that fs would be a sign of poor self discipline . 
  there is the matter of the us 's rather unique collegiate and high school sports systems , but that 's another topic and for that pe would be such a hilariously low standard anyway . 
  edit : as an aside i recall that in some countries there 's a pretty large portion of the population with little to no swimming ability . 
  young kids are usually taught to swim here as toddlers or young kids . 
  there is an additional aquatics segment in high school . 
  for schools without pool access it still includes things like rescue and dry land training . 
  nobody in the world uses the yuan if they do n't have to . 
  chinese only use it because they 're not allowed to trade it in for a more valuable/stable foreign currency and outsiders use it only because it 's required to do business in china . 
  pretty sure it 's `` cheese product '', 
  west virginia is probably undergoing net emigration if anything , and has been for quite some time . 
  it 's been an economically depressed region basically since it 's founding . 
  my initial thought is either russian or spanish . 
  however i think i prefer the latin american spanish accents to iberian , so i 'll go with russian . 
  if the cardinal electors were actually proportional to the world 's catholic population then it would n't be that unbelievable to have a black pope from central or south america . 
  counties and cities can also have higher minimum wages . 
  san francisco 's $ 10.55 is the highest in the us . 
  reddit does n't in the remotest sense reflect the opinion of the majority of americans . 
  if you read by saying the words in your head it sounds ( in many accents ) nearly identical to could 've . 
  the european system does n't mean that that the players are any more local than nfl teams . 
  it 's more like they are a bunch of green bays . 
  at lower levels there are clubs with stipulations for local players , but at that point you 're dealing with the equivalent of us high school and jc teams . 
  1 % of the population speaking another language is worthy of this ? 
  i 'm rather amazed that 1 % qualifies it as the largest non-native language , really . 
  i suppose that 's because most immigrants to the uk come from english-speaking former colonies . 
  i would have guessed there 'd at least be like 2 % french or german going on . 
  that was actually liquid cheese product stuff .

  i have n't seen a paper check used outside of mailed bills in like 10 years . 
  this is typical protocol for war memorials and cemeteries on foreign soil . 
  there 's a memorial on the eastern seaboard of the us for british ww2 uboat victims that is perpetually leased to the united kingdom . 
  it 's not the same as an embassy or consulate , basically just a piece of land owned by a foreign country just like a private citizen might except probably exempt from any taxes . 
  usually the foreign government is responsible for maintenance of the memorial . 
  the american battle monuments commission oversees and pays for the upkeep of us memorials for wwi and wwii , for instance . 
  from the numbers for my own area i would guess that sunlight means clear sky or partial clouds . 
  be advised that as this is solar energy per area it 's going to be far less at extreme latitudes even with comparable total hours of sunlight . 
  i 'm so sorry . 
  the political capital of making this move is probably worth a great deal more than a few thousand euros . 
  both numbers have significant meaning . 
  research published per capita can indirectly show how much of the populous is engaged in the field , which is interesting . 
  however , publications are not similar to income in that only one person/household will be the beneficiary some lump sum . 
  research is n't consumed and the entire country ( or world ) could very well benefit from a single piece of research . 
  he 's still involved in international politics even if not a direct participant . 
  perhaps more importantly he heads a major international charity organization . 
  what 's interesting is that he 's more `` powerful '' than his wife the current secretary of state of the united states . 
  probably because she does n't actually set policy ( well , the important policies anyway , those are obama 's call even though she and the rest of the cabinet have influence ) .
