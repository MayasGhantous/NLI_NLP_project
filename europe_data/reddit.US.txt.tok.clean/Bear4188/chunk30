  both of these are problematic . 
  same reason uk does n't have one . 
  he has a great eye . 
  we already have mountains . 
  [ beagle 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exploration_of_mars#timeline_of_mars_exploration ) failed . 
  ships basically have a fixed lifespan in terms of how long they can spend at sea . 
  us navy likes to extend this over as much real time as possible by rotating fleets . 
  something like 1/3 at sea , 1/3 in maintenance , 1/3 sitting in port . 
  this also means that at war time they can pretty much instantly double the number of active fleets by going to 2/3 at sea , 1/3 in maintenance . 
  numbers are n't exact but that 's a rough idea of the doctrine . 
   airwars conflict monitoring group director chris woods told the mirror :  `` where we have more concern with the mod is its assertion , an aggressive assertion at times , that they have killed no civilians in the war in iraq and syria despite more than 1,000 air strikes . 
   that would be unprecedented in the history of warfare . '', 
  tacos do n't really have any carbs beyond the tortilla . 
  but without the tortilla it 's not a taco . 
  countries like mexico are every bit as developed as western europe or the united states when it comes to their major cities and economic centers ( [ e.g. 
  they juxtapose this with regions that have been totally neglected , e.g. 
  the southern states with higher native population . 
  it 's a tale of extreme inequality .

  the only english accents i have trouble with are the thickest of indian ones and those ones in england that sounds like english from 500 years ago . 
  american/canadian english is very similar relative to other languages because of all the movement and mixing . 
  for reference , australia mandatory voting system which fines anyone who does n't vote has a turnout of ~ 94 % . 
  most us games are like this . 
  the 84 and 96 village are student dorms iirc . 
  yes they are . 
  duterte , if he thinks anything at all , is gambling that the us will protect the philippines regardless . 
  he 's probably right . 
  we are allied to the philippines not to their turd president who will be gone after a term . 
  in the us it 's used for large trucks , heavy equipment , and freight trains . 
  that 's what we actually call it though .

  so does fiji !, 
  production lines are definitely movable . 
  toyota moved a bunch out of my area a few years back . 
  yes that 's what happened . 
  the us is to blame for european state agencies failing to uphold environmental protections violated by a german multinational . 
  because having super low tax rates for multinationals is ( they argue ) valuable to the irish economy . 
  eu argues that this amounts to illegal subsidy . 
  i expect this will be elevated to a wto dispute eventually . 
  why not falcon ? 
  6.3 is not the strongest of earthquakes but strong enough that non-retrofitted masonry buildings are turned into deathtraps . 
  the soil composition for the area is also very important . 
  you need to account for team and relay medals . 
  for instance serbia had a lot of team success . 
  more than half their athletes won a medal . 
  they 're retiring soon . 
  ours ( california ) subsidizes education . 
  i 'm fine with it . 
  pretty much the only military parade we ever get is a presidential inauguration . 
  those are just marching with no vehicles . 
  the other thing we get is fleet week which includes a naval parade . 
  the relationship between americans and their army is complicated . 
  basically we do n't want to see it flexing its muscles except in case of war ( or a celebratory parade after a `` popular '' war , e.g. 
  gulf war i , ww2 ) . 
  historically the army would be torn down to a tiny remnant during peace time . 
  if you want to see equipment you need to go to an event at a military base ( e.g. 
  that would be arctic camo for when the gulf stream dies . 
  yeah there should be fewer opportunities for swimmers to compete in the olympics . 
  medal table rankings are the real priority . 
  beijing olympics involved a great deal of displacing residents without proper compensation , shutting down industry and traffic for the whole area for weeks just to get visible pollution down , are the most expensive in history , and still they 've ended up with a bunch of structures that now sit empty . 
  it was successful if your only criteria is whether or not foreigners were entertained . 
  considered the human and monetary cost it was a robbery . 
  world cup is a national event . 
  each city just accommodates one stadium 's worth of events . 
  the olympics has all events in one city , more competitors , and a much faster schedule . 
  realistically only well developed mega cities can actually meat that sort of demand without everything else grinding to a stop . 
  it 's something people do when they 're angry but do n't have anything of substance to communicate . 
  our flag is burned so often it does n't even mean anything anymore . 
  the us has possession of nuclear weapons ( i believe they are all of the air launch variety ) that are stationed on turkish soil . 
  no it is n't . 
  uk needs to sort their shit out before anyone else can negotiate anything with them . 
  tpp is pretty much a conglomeration of countries that have inserted themselves into the process when they decided they liked where it was headed . 
  south korea and taiwan are considering entry right now . 
  it 's really just a matter of whether usa/japan/australia are comfortable with uk coming in . 
  it 's not like being on the pacific as actually important . 
  the focus is actually on setting trade rules in asia so china ca n't bully all the weaker members . 
  you do n't even know who 's in the basketball tournament maybe you do n't have a pulse on what people are interested in . 
  got ta watch out for the white house chef . 
  only if the asian countries get to bring horse archers . 
  36 % is an abysmal rating for a presidential candidate . 
  france has a nuclear arsenal . 
  [ americans do n't like to elect short presidents ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heights_of_presidents_and_presidential_candidates_of_the_united_states ) , in the television era anyway . 
  we had history , geography , or social science classes every year from 3rd through 12th grade . 
  obviously most of those the students are too young to actually learn anything meaningful though . 
  iirc early civililzation/classical period history was covered in 6th ( china , india , egypt , mesopotamia , greece , rome , mesoamerica ) and 9th grade ( european or world history ) . 
  unfortunately my 9th grade teacher was a bum who had no business having a job . 
  american history is covered in 8th and 11th grade . 
  economics in 10th . 
  american government ( civics ) in 12th . 
  so obviously the greater emphasis is given to american history by teaching it at a later age when the students may actually learn something significant .
