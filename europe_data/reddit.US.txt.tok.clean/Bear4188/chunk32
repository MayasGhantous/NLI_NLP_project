  you sauce it immediately before serving and eat it before it gets soggy . 
  never had a problem with this , or mexican , or chinese , whatever . 
  are you supposed to condemn yourself to soft textures just because you like sauces ? 
  schnitzel is great . 
  they 're replacing the los angeles class . 
  36 * los angeles * - class nuclear attack submarine 3 * seawolf * - class nuclear attack submarine 13 * virginia * - class nuclear attack submarine ( 48 planned ) 14 * ohio * - class nuclear ballistic missile submarine 4 * ohio * - class nuclear guided missile submarine they 're all pretty big subs , too . 
  she 's baygoing at least . 
  they can borrow our constitution for a little while . 
  we 're not using it anyway . 
  both la olympics have been very successful . 
  still using the stadium 90 + years later . 
  village turned into dorms for ucla , smaller venues become convention centers , etc. 
  it 's better to read that as a relation between celtic and romance languages . 
  there was certainly plenty of intermingling between celtic groups and latin during the roman empire . 
  all indo-european languages are pretty closely related , relatively speaking . 
  yes but only death valley . 
  it really depends on the gop congress . 
  imo if trump knew about this and did nothing for two weeks , as has been suggested , it 's a more egregious offense than watergate . 
  impeachable . 
  at the lightest we 're talking about obstruction of justice ( lying to the fbi or withholding evidence ) or violating the 1799 logan act prohibiting anyone other than official diplomats from partaking in diplomacy . 
  at worst it could be tried as espionage , which carries a maximum sentence of execution . 
  if the gop wants to go down with the ship , though , who knows what will happen . 
  right now it looks like the senate wants to investigate and the house are rats . 
  normal, 
  topography has a big affect . 
  mountains pen in pollution and it builds up until a strong wind comes in . 
  the europe equivalent would be the ural mountains . 
  escape from new york ? 
  i protest .

  we stay out of the sun . 
  if you have to work in the sun then you should wear it . 
  also wear sunglasses . 
  actually i was wrong . 
  it 's * gerald ford * then * john f kennedy * then * enterprise * . 
  maybe they can get together and we can have experienced islands . 
  enterprise is expected to be the name for the carrier to come after * uss gerald ford * . 
  ships are named by congress . 
  e pluribus unum is the good one . 
  it 's sitting in the corner covered in dust . 
  it may be a little too federalist for the eu though . 
  [ that 's nothing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4mlwjdl_a8 ), 
  i do n't like all the color . 
  prefer things just be etched in stone . 
  it will be massive when it happens though . 
  buses , taxis too . 
  any military appointments were bound to be at least acceptable . 
  you just ca n't rise through the military without being very competent in some way . 
  americans and mass migration due to climate change, 
  trump is probably going to end up as an effectively powerless figurehead that does whatever his cabinet tells him to . 
  he 's been mimicking other people the whole way already . 
  the us shares warhead designs with the uk . 
  it 's disingenuous to say that the uk has n't benefited . 
  the missiles all come out of the same stockpile . 
  drop one off for maintenance and pick up another . 
  us and uk mate their own separate warheads to the missile . 
  it would make no sense for the missiles to have any sort of remote defeat device , putting such a vulnerability on the us 's own last resort weapon would be insane . 
  they 're meant to be able to guide themselves and detonate without any external assistance once launched . 
  because being entitled to free expression is one of the foundations of western civilization . 
  what do germans know about border walls anyway ? 
  they do when they hate the sitting government . 
  puritans were not the first settlers . 
  if donald trump is a presbyterian then i 'm a zoroastrian . 
  china knows what it is to suffer and that 's why they do n't want to suffer again . 
  they allow for all sort of political repression as long as they continue to see economic growth . 
  the opposite is not something they are signed on for . 
  checking if the meat is ready is just a simple matter of checking the temperature and time it 's been at that temperature . 
  this can be done with infrared or with a probe . 
  they did n't used to be . 
  iraqi freedom and op . 
  enduring freedom are just ham fisted propaganda from the bush administration . 
  desert shield , desert storm , desert sabre , gothic serpent , able sentry , new horizon , neptune spear , arc light , game warden , linebacker , rolling thunder , iceberg , detachment , cartwheel , downfall , etc. 
  they are n't usually so on the nose . 
  really the next worse is the desert - theme for anything to do with iraq up until bush administration inexplicably changed away . 
  the power of china is that it has a natural geographic center so it keeps rising again and again . 
  there 's no real reason that the mediterranean should have a power based in italy instead of iberia or greece or egypt or anatolia . 
  in china the dominant power is always that which controls the yangtze and yellow rivers . 
  so even when they split apart or are conquered the regime that follows inevitably concentrates in the same place and absorbs the local culture all over again . 
  i remember being annoyed that walker : texas ranger reruns were being interrupted by the princess diana special news broadcast . 
   on november 3 , 2016 , he u.s. army announced thursday that it will deploy about 4,000 soldiers from 3rd armored brigade combat team to europe in winter in support of operation atlantic resolve - to help deter possible russian aggression . 
  [ 23 ] the brigade will arrive in poland and will fan out across the continent , one battalion with m1 abrams tanks will cover the baltic region of estonia and latvia , while another will operate in germany . 
  a mechanised infantry battalion with m2 bradley troop carriers and m1 abrams tanks will have a foothold in the romanian and bulgarian region , whilst brigade headquarters will remain in poland , along with an armoured cavalry unit and a field artillery battalion wielding self-propelled m109 paladin howitzers . 
  [ 24 ] [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_infantry_division_ ( united_states \\ ) #operation _ atlantic_resolve ), 
  pretty much . 
  i assume they were supposed to try to fire from a foxhole or something so they can get some cover . 
  basically the strategy of the small shells was to just completely irradiate an area and make it impossible to fight in or move troops through . 
  us had a 155mm nuclear artillery shell . 
  also the ridiculous man portable nuclear recoilless rifle . 
  storefront looks completely fine . 
  no less tasteful than a souvenir shop . 
  except for the previous 8 months of him taking his crap . 
  us offensive cyber capabilities are extremely sophisticated . 
  defensively it 's a mess . 
  `` sanctioning '' an economy larger than your own hurts yourself more than your target . 
  unless you have some monopoly on an essential commodity you ca n't really sanction the us in any meaningful way . 
  pretty much only china has any such monopoly , btw , and they do n't give a fuck about anything but becoming wealthier . 
  it is , as would be tpp . 
  alaska is that far north . 
  this projection is useless for comparing area , it 's for comparing latitude . 
  technically the electors vote tomorrow .
