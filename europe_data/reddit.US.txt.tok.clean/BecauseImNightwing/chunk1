oh man , you really want to play this game what with russia 's history ? 
  how about russia committing genocide in ukraine ? 
  or how about the soviets signed pacts with the goddamn * nazis * ? 
  or how about the fact that the ussr invaded and pretty much raped and occupied eastern europe for half a century and you * still * wo n't admit it was wrong ( i mean , at least the germans have the common decency to apologize and be ashamed ) ? 
  or how about the invasion of afghanistan and the death of over 2.5 million afghan civilians that occured there ? 
  want more ? 
  i got heaps . 
  we 're not perfect , but maybe you should get off your high horse , as you 're in no position to judge . 
  libya was sanctioned by the un , so not much use pointing the finger at nato since the entire security council was on board . 
  iraq was n't a nato op . 
  sure , the countries involved belonged to nato , but it was n't a nato operation like afghanistan was/is . 
  you need to either try harder or do more studying of recent history . 
  `` racial identity '' ? 
  what the fuck does that even mean ? 
  sounds like you 're on some master race trip . 
  really ? 
  because the last time i checked ukraine was in europe and that country recently caught a case of the ruskies ... also , do n't overestimate yourselves . 
  even as a coalition the eu lacks the capabilities to take on russia in a conventional conflict without us support . 
  your logistical capabilities simply are n't there . 
  probably . 
  still much cheaper than an a-10 . 
  still think a 20 would do the trick . 
  that 's the same size gun they mount on the bradley . 
  20mm i think would work fine . 
  in coin ops cas is n't going to be going after anything heavier than a toyota pickup . 
  even quad .50 s would be more than enough to shred something like that . 
  even if some guy got his hands on an apc or an up-armored humvee the 20s could shred it or you could just drop a jdam on it . 
  the biggest issue with mounting a 30mm on a prop plane is the weight . 
  not only of the gun but of the ammo itself . 
  you would n't be able to fit many missiles or bombs on it . 
  that 's why we should replace the a-10 with aircraft like the super tucano or the texan ii ( or please , please * please * bring back the a-1 skyraider ) . 
  propeller driven aircraft are relatively cheap to make , * very * cheap to operate and are great for coin . 
  we do n't need jets for cas when we 're fighting pukes in the desert armed with aks and rpg-7s . 
  yeah , american companies are n't owned by the government so if another country allows them to drill there it 's on the host . 
  still is n't the same branch . 
  try calling a marine a sailor . 
  see how it works out for you . 
  ah , the ol' `` but we spend more as a percentage ! '', 
  argument . 
  figured this would come up . 
  irrelevant . 
  we still spend more . 
  those kids in the phillipines did n't care that sweden spends more as a percentage of their gdp , they just knew that most of the foreign relief workers were wearing the uniform of the us military and most of the boxes carrying their food were stamped with the american flag . 
  yes , but they are their own separate branch of the us military . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_marine_corps never said they were a humanitarian organization but the dod undertakes more humanitarian operations and provides more relief in a year than the eu does in five , so i 'll let you decide . 
  kek . 
  the world 's wealthiest , most military dominant , most scientifically advanced country in the world that is a permenant member of the unsc and is the driving force behind nato is just a `` follow-up colony '' and is n't as `` universal or important '' . 
  wow . 
  the ignorance is so strong with you . 
  that or the bitterness that europe has been playing second-fiddle to the us for the better part of a century . 
  probably both . 
  it 's okay man , some people still care what europe thinks , even though * everyone * knows the eu lacks the solidarity to actually create something resembling a cohesive foreign policy . 
  edit : oh , i remember you !, 
  you were that nutball who said that europe is wiser than the us . 
  remind me , which of the two ( or 20 of us if you want to talk about eu nations individually ) is the superpower ? 
  marines are n't the navy , dude . 
  jesus , if you 're going to insult us military at least get the branches right . 
  also , til that this picture negates the haitian earthquake disaster relief , the japanese tsunami and earthquake disaster relief , the philippine typhoon disaster relief , the malaysian tsunami relief and on ... and on ... and on ... all that hard work down the drain because a few jarheads took a piss on the corpse of a jihadist . 
  smh . 
  but hey , it 's easy to criticize when someone else does all the heavy lifting when it comes to disaster relief , amirite ? 
  [ whatever man ] ( http://media.giphy.com/media/134cbbasmerpda/giphy.gif ), 
  the british empire controlled half the world 's wealth at one point ? 
  even at the height of both of those empire 's glory they were challenged at every level by their neighbors . 
  the british by the french , the spanish by the british . 
  that list is n't talking about the greatest empires . 
  it 's talking about the * largest * . 
  hey , it 's cool . 
  i was n't exactly a shining example of a human being myself . 
  aaa is n't nearly as important as sams these days . 
  like what ? 
  your guns ? 
  when was the last time there was a gun kill in air combat ? 
  i believe it was in the falklands . 
  air superiority is * the * deciding factor in wars between states . 
  has been since wwii . 
  if you do n't have air superiority it 's much , much worse . 
  not really . 
  you 're citing a study which claims people think germany has more global influence than the united states . 
  furthermore all you did was link to the graph , which calls into question the legitimacy of the poll . 
  how was it worded ? 
  why is it a black and white response ? 
  personally i think you 're just a dude with an axe to grind against the us . 
  which is cool . 
  you have at it my man . 
  til your everyday dude on the street has a real comprehensive idea of who has global power and who does n't . 
  come on , do you seriously think * germany * has more global power than the united states ? 
  give me a break . 
  they ca n't even fly a plane to iraq without it breaking down . 
  only if starting wage for a pfc is six figures ^ ^ dod ^ ^ pls, 
  if you 're saying land-controlled = success than i guess russia is the most successful country of the modern era , and we all know that is n't true . 
   you 're nurturing anti-americanism on / r/europe [ 1 ] . 
  that 's what you 're doing , `` ambassador of the u.s. ''  great job .

  [ debatable ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/1/ )  china is rising . 
  geostrategists agree on this . 
  they also agree that china will not become a hegemon because it is surrounded by powerhouses that * all * dislike it .
