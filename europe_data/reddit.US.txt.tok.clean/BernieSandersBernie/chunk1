haha , you 're always welcome . 
  thanks for the ideas . 
  oh , it 's all good . 
  er - so , could i make a post like that ? 
  if not , that 's okay . 
  no sweat , just trying to get the word out , but it 's kind of hard with sub reddit rules . 
  i just mean that people wo n't be accused of shilling , that is , stating opinions because they 're getting paid to do so . 
  that 's exactly what i 'm saying . 
  it 's a symbol of oppression to you and to some , but it 's a symbol of modesty to others . 
  i mean , it 's one thing asking for things to be a certain way in your own country and for muslims to respect that , but then to go to their country and not respect their laws . . ? 
  this right here . 
  does n't france forbid the wearing of headscarfs in school ? 
  how is that any different ? 
  it 's the control of clothing . 
  but there are many places where we regulate clothing . 
  when you go to church or school , when you go to work - there are always regulations on what is appropriate and what is inappropriate . 
  if you do n't follow those regulations you can get kicked out or fired . 
  this is another culture with different regulations . 
  but you would see her face ... 
  a more long-term effort of what exactly ? 
  serious question . 
  true , true . 
  the point is , being world police friggen ' sucks . 
  we are idealists and optimists , but reality is setting in . 
  let 's be world police together , europe , on equal footing . 
  you really think that if we left troops in iraq those acts would n't have happened ? 
  is n't this what the romans tried to do in palestine back in the day ? 
  but fascism was n't a religion . 
  it 's much easier to disprove the idea that germans are the superior race - just defeat them in battle . 
  much harder to disprove god himself . 
  i mean , kind of ... europe always gives us shit , no matter what we do . 
  and that 's all right , that 's their right and duty , someone should call us out . 
  but the thing is , why would we want to be the leader of the free world when it comes to military ? 
  we want to have better social policies like europe does , and it 's very hard when we 're spending this much on weapons . 
  keep up the good work . 
  sounds awesome . 
  i 'm just playing around . 
  you guys are all right . 
  we love and care about our allies . 
  we just do n't want to be paying a disproportionate amount of the bill . 
  i mean , we are very , very safe over here in fortress america . 
  pretty sure the bern is on board . 
  hillary ... not so much ... 
  thank you , russia . 
  yes , come on easterners , get these western softies to create an army . 
  good question . 
  yeah , right now they have what we had under the articles of confederation . 
  an alliance that does n't work in many areas . 
  and that 's huge . 
  with $ 70billion dollars we could afford free public college in all of the united states . 
  we are hurting over here and need to trim the fat . 
  why do we need to do this though ? 
  i mean , that 's literally madness - we need to always be ready for a pacific and european crisis at the same time ? 
  why should it not be a requirement ? 
  right , the us does n't really have any security problems either . 
  nor does canada . 
  it 's hard to be buddies with russia ... 
  but even if it happened , that would be fine . 
  if europe became buddies with them , the us would probably be buddies too . 
  i agree with you about the american situation , but why would increased military spending by europe be tribute to the us ? 
  thanks for the clarification , yes , i see what you mean . 
  without a doubt , and there are people here trying to work on that . 
  in this election , senators paul and sanders were trying to push this message . 
  sanders has come close to the democratic nomination , but not close enough it seems . 
  i am just talking about the fact that we pay for most of the nato budget , as can be seen here : thanks for this explanation . 
  it 's helpful . 
  i guess i am talking about statistics like this : https://www.google.com/search?q=nato+budget+by+country&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=657&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=dkshk45surveum%253a%253bwqapearprl7krm%253bhttp%25253a%25252f%25252fukcmilhist.freeforums.org%25252fdoes-nato-have-the-will-to-face-up-to-russia-t2214.html&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=dkshk45surveum%253a%252cwqapearprl7krm%252c_&amp;usg=__ebsv6ey9_c1k0oecy7bojejkbsm%3d&amp;ved=0ahukewj-85fvq8rlahugbd4kherna0cqyjcijq&amp;ei=mqlsvr7dc4by-qhqm4-4ba#imgrc=um00msxpmiwyhm%3a, 
  that 's right . 
  and it 's a bad policy . 
  i would argue that it is to the benefit of european citizens . 
  it 's good to have a hegemon having your back while you can focus on other important matters in your countries . 
  yeah , what is actually good for american citizens as a result of the us being a hegemon ? 
  we are in a very safe position over here , with important allies to the north and south , and no one really being able to threaten us . 
  so why are we spending a disproportionate amount on nato ? 
  this is not meant as any kind of insult to my european brothers and sisters , it 's just a situation that does n't make sense . 
  thanks for this explanation . 
  it 's helpful .

  perhaps . 
  it still seems like the us and russia make the best weapons , and people will keep wanting to buy these weapons no matter what . 
  basically , the people are fooled by the politicians/media into thinking we 're under threat . 
  the politicians are bought by the military-industrial complex/other special interests and would have trouble getting re-elected if they cut the budget . 
  it 's a fucked up , vicious circle . 
  right , that 's why the us needs to lower its military budget , spend less money on forces in europe and continue profiting from arms sales to europe . 
  we make money from arms sales not because we have forces in europe but because we manufacture good weapons . 
  exactly . 
  yeah . 
  what i 'm saying though is that this is not actually helpful to the average american . 
  just the military-industrial complex screwing people over . 
  agreed . 
  we 're not going to leave or threaten to leave . 
  europeans and their politicians know this . 
  so there 's not really any reason to raise budgets . 
  meanwhile , our media focuses on scaring the crap out of the people and the politicians raise and raise the military budget ... obama just proposed one that 's the highest budget we 've had since wwii ... 
  but the thing is , as long as the us spends more , it 's not in the interest of eu citizens or politicians to want to raise defense budgets ... kinda sucks ... 
  i suspect it 's not as extreme in europe ? 
  so , we have one family , the waltons , that owns as much as the bottom 40 % of the country . 
  the top .01 % of the nation owns as much as the bottom 90 % . 
  yeah , we 're rich , but all the wealth is in the hands of very , very few people . 
  come on , germany !,
