marx wrote one . 
  lol that got the ball rolling in a pretty big way . 
  but there 's also the dictionary definition & wiki page too to help cover the others . 
  however , if i can ask you , how do you figure that a ideology that has pushed for worker-control of the means of production & the abolishment of private property , who 's most prominent thinker was a famed economist , does n't have it 's own brand of economics ? 
  i mean ... is socialism not pushed often as a alternative to capitalism ? 
  i do n't know whether to be mad that you 're ignoring the fact that at it 's core socialism is as much a economic ideology tas a political one * ( more so even , with the latter side merely existing as a means to serve the former ) * , or happy that socialism is such a abysmal failure that capitalists have literally managed to rip out it 's very soul & force people to re-define within a capitalist framework ... the the point that people like you now even question the very existance of * `` socialist economics '' * ... 
   there is no socialist economics . 
  good point . 
  * `` socialism '' * is basically inter-changeable with * `` private ownership '' * & * `` free-market economics '' * . 
  in fact , socialism has never been put forward as a alternative to capitalism what-so-ever , and socialiste have always been capitalists . 
  the only true socialism is the scandinavian kind which rejects socialist economics as retarded . 
  from your link :  modern social democracy has ** abandoned economic socialism ** as its goal by rejecting state ownership or direct worker ownership of the means of production and a reorganization of the economy , and instead advocates a welfare state , ** regulated capitalism ** and some public ownership of supporting industries . 
  while it is still considered a socialist political movement , modern social democracy ** advocates capitalist economic systems ** such as the social market economy , third-way mixed economies and relies on keynesian economics . 
  how socialist is that really ? 
  i mean there 's literally like a mile of text on that page describing various socialist movements , and then you have that tagged on too the end , basically saying * `` some people consider it socialism even though it ' a capitalist as shit '' * . 
  iceland has the population of amchorage , alaska . 
  iceland has the population of a larhe suburb . 
  * admit to increased regional instability & need for stronger military * recongnize that eu army , in the best circumstances , is years off , and in the worse circumstances , not going to happen * do n't increase military spending & rely on eu army which is unlikely to happen in the forseeable future * ????? 
  * v-day logic ^ tm, 
  * sanctions are contentious because of how they could negatively affect european bussinesses collaborating with the occupiers *, 
  is this article implying revenue as a whole should be taxed instead of profits ? 
  amazon went from a small start-up online bookstore to dominating retail distribution globally within 20 years . 
  in other words , it 's gone into expansion . 
  lol, 
  sounds like internalized racism to me . 
  house horses manipulated by thoroughbred privelage . 
  underfed cancer ponies that hate the queen . 
  are you happy now brexiters !?!, 
  they 're all racist too , so they 're probably cousins or some shit with the underfed cancer-ridden british ponies . 
  juncker would have to go set up shell corporations in a gold-plated maybach instead of a platinum-plated one . 
  and probably has cancer from the non-eu american feed it 's been forcefed . 
  also likely racist . 
  russia has flown strategic bombers & docked warships in cuba , venezuela & nicaragua . 
  so what ? 
  fair enough . 
  and as for context for everybody else , i wrote a long post at first , but deleted it , deciding to basically summarize it instead so as to be more diplomatic . 
   you only like countries if they adore your country ? 
  well , i would n't say they * `` adore '' * us , just are cooler with us than a lot of the others . 
  and i like all our european allies ... just as much as i like all our anglosphere & far east asian allies ... but i got a soft spot for eastern europe . 
  real recongnize real homie . 
  i 'm american dude . 
  the populations of most european states hate us , treating us like rabid imperialists terrorizing the world & holding them down through shadowy influence , completely ignoring how unprecedented , prosperous & independent the international system we pushed & maintained after wwii was ... he same one they happily embrace ... or just how essential & close a ally we 've been to europeann integration , defense & economic growth for more than half-a-century . 
  the baltics , poland & romania are like a breath of fresh air . 
  the type of countries that remind me , hey , this is why i do n't support trump 's retarded * `` america first '' * protectionist & isolationist attitude . 
  yeah sure , whatever , that works too . 
  lol still cool with them . 
  like the rest of the baltics , very cool with america , so i 'm very cool with them . 
  we . . ugh ... might 've taken this competition a bit too far in hindsight ... 
   i did n't say the american legal system is bad or that i do n't think we should use anything from it . 
  yo , literally from your first post :  it 's really bad because , in my opinion , the american political system is a really bad one . 
  i honestly do n't think i would . 
  * `` not america '' * is a essential part of the national identity you 've forged . 
  it 's the defining feature that you yourselves have chosen for being canadian . 
  to abandon all the insecure shit talking would cause ... hell ... it 'd cause mayham . 
  absolute mayham . 
  riots in the streets , angry mobs roaming the countryside , raping your churches & burning your women . 
  or not . 
  and the whole thing 's just kinda a silly . 
  but i 'll be damned if widespread anti-americanism does n't exist anyway . 
  yes , and you ever hear the sterotype of canadians being obsessed with the united states ? 
  that 's where that comes from . 
  in fact , i think it was a canadian academic who once described it best , and to paraphrase them :  americans are benovently ignorant of canada , while canadians are maliciously informed about america . 
  canadians are pretty insecure over their weak national identity , so i can forgive them for their constant anti-americanism . 
  i mean if it was n't for that & ties to a foreign monarch who 's a ocean away , what would they be ? 
  ireland is gone , north ireland is half-way out the door & scotland is trying to pick the lock . 
  the westminister system has proven nothing to me other than that it creates a weak national identity and that it 's pointed lack of checks & balances alienate entire regions to the point of never-ending & always-present threats of seccession . 
  there 's nothing to truly check a shitty executive either , since the executive is by extension the legislature , and both can basically run wild on the judiciary . 
  you wo n't find trump being able to three-line whip congress into doing whatever the fuck he wants it too , or it blantantly overruling him with enough support . 
   it 's really bad because , in my opinion , the american political system is a really bad one . 
  we should n't be trying to replicate it . 
  and yet your provinces do n't even have free trade between themselves , you 're permanantly insecure over quebec seccession & you have such a weak national identity that you have to compensate for it with unfocused anti-americanism , which alienates your closest ally and the only country you share a real border with , & a foreign monarch , which furthur alienates quebec . 
  not to mention , because of your system of government , you basically have very little checks & balances compared to us . 
  we get trump or somebody else , the other branches of government can move to check him because their power is relatively balanced . 
  hence our focus on a seperation of powers . 
  you operate on the basis of a fusion of powers , like westminister , where basically everything is subordinate to the legislature . 
  you get a trump or somebody worse than him , you 're utterly fucked . 
  i mean , lol , who 's going to check their power ? 
  the queen 's ceremonial governor-general , who 's only appointed with said leader 's permission ? 
  the canadian senate , who 's also onoy appointed with said leader 's permission ? 
  america 's system has been tested through the best times & the worse times . 
  we were by ourselves for our expansion from a coastal backwater to a continent-spanning superpower . 
  we survived foreign war , civil war , mass social transformation & economic depression . 
  canada did n't become a country until the british had already conquered the continent , and it did n't stop being a colony until the worse of the 20th century was over & american hegemony had begun with canada closely tied in alliance to the country upholding it . 
  do n't sit here & shit on america when your system is not only so flawed in itself , but has also never been pushed the brink & tested like the american one . 
  [ ** also from three days ago ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6rluwc/til_that_due_to_eu_regulations_eu_eggs_are_about/dl68fz9 )  more regularly than in america even . 
   [ ** cdc ** ] ( https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6253a1.htm ) :   in 2013 , the incidence of salmonellosis in the united states was 15.5 laboratory-confirmed infections per 100,000 population ,  [ ** european food safety authority ( * warning * : pdf ) ** ] ( http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/publications/eu-summary-report-trends-sources-zoonoses-2013.pdf )   in 2013 , a total of 82,694 confirmed salmonellosis cases were reported by 27 eu ms , resulting in an eu notification rate of 20.4 cases per 100,000 population . 
  [ ** and ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6rluwc/til_that_due_to_eu_regulations_eu_eggs_are_about/dl6bfbt )  well , to quote / u/helpmeredditimbored below :   the video says that there has been no study to say which method is better . 
  the data they present only compares england & wales to the entire us , and even they say that it needs to be taken with a large grain of salt ( also it 's mostly the uk egg industry that is talked about , while eu regulations are barely mentioned ),

  the right wing base voted for him because they did n't like the far right . 
  the left wing base voted for him because they did n't like the far left . 
  niether really much like him because he reminds them too much of the otherside . 
  they are not a logical race , wise one !, 
  they go around chopping down trees for tables , when they have perfectly good tummies to eat on . 
  how logical is that ? 
  gets pushed to the top of / r/europe with thousands of upvotes . 
  why in god 's name would you think i was trying to imply that ? 
  lol of course i 'm aware of them , as is every american , but my contention was with the accusation that they were caused to compensate for a weak national identity . 
  hence me pointing to the very popular sterotype of us being a big circlejerk with our backs to the window , for better or for worse .
