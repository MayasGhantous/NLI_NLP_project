  yeah i 'm retarded sorry . 
  lol i should 've caught that after i wrote what two hundred years from alaska & hawaii 's statehood would be . 
  your king at the time did like to eat nazi ass though . 
  actually , in reference to the continental united states , it 'd either be 2053 if we 're going by territotial aquisition , or 2113 if we 're going by state-hood . 
  your king at the time would 've eaten nazi ass if you did n't move to constantly check him . 
  as a authoritarian dictatorship & you did n't preserve it for two centuries either . 
  the confederacy literally seceded to preserve slavery . 
  bleeding kansas was fought because of slavery . 
  the missouri compromise was about slavery . 
  the civil war was over slavery . 
  the union knew it , the confedetacy knew it , and every american knew it . 
  and not only did they know it then , but they knew it was a ticking time bomb for decades before . 
  i. ... do n't think that 's accurate ... lol in fact , one of the most frequent criticisms i hear of americans are that they are ignorant of world affairs , untraveled & under the impression the nothing really much matters beyond our borders . 
  it literally takes a massive terrorist attack or the threat of nuclear annihalation to get us to focus on something . 
  it 's become more prominent now that we have a incompetant piece-of-shit as president , but the anti-american bullshit & * `` us vs them '' * drive by eu federalists was there with obama too & it was just as annoying as now . 
  however , than again , this might be a return to normal . 
  the anti-american vibe was atrocious pre-ukraine as well . 
  although , trump aside , we 're europe 's closest & most powerful ally . 
  we helped defend it 's liberal democratic order through two world wars & a cold war . 
  we helped re-build it after it was turned to rubble . 
  we played a vital role in driving it 's integration . 
  europe devours our culture & embraces the international system that was forged at our direction , under americam hegemony , after wwii . 
  but , you seemingly hate us , and do n't view us as a close ally , but as a potential enemy . 
  an this did not just happen with trump . 
  it seemingly goes much deeper , since the sentiment goes way furthur way . 
  no , i get it . 
  america is still a white supremacist slave-state , it 's shit legacy will be a stain on human history due to the widespread global destruction it 's imperialism hae wrought , it 's neoliberal capitalist influence is the worst thing to have ever happened to europe , which would 've been 1000x better without american involvement , & the only thing that can fix the oppressive tyranny that is the american government is a socialist revolution . 
  no need for a long debate , i 'm conceding & admitting you won right off the bat homie . 
  enjoy your victory over the amerikkkunt empire . 
  i ai n't the sub having a anti-american bitchfest every day . 
  lol hell , what is this ? 
  like the 5th day in the row that a * `` fuck america '' * shitpost has hit the top with thousands of upvotes ? 
  and the comments are alway the same , shitting on us to encourage some abstract eu national identity . 
  i mean , like seriously , are european federalists seriously so inept & incapable at forging a new national identity for their dream state , that they have to make america the scary foreign boogeyman to unite everybody around ? 
  do n't they have any home-grown pride or ideals that do n't need a foreign boogeyman ? 
  or at the very least , can they pick a boogeyman that is n't their closest ally & the country which played a vital role itself in the eu 's creation ? 
  it 's as if they 've become so dominated by american culture that we 're the only other non-eu foreign country that they feel comfortable using as a reference point . 
  also afterwards , when we threw all our military , economic & diplomatic weight behind european integration through things like the marshall plan , nato , and the : [ ** american committee on united europe ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_committee_on_united_europe )  the american committee on united europe ( * acue * ) , founded in 1948 , was an american organization which sought to counter the communist threat in europe by promoting european political integration . 
  its first chairman was ex-wartime oss head william joseph donovan . 
   _________  declassified american government documents have shown that the acue was an important early funder of both the european movement and the european youth campaign . 
   ________  the u.s. policy was to promote a united states of europe , and to this end the committee was used to discreetly funnel cia funds - by the mid 50 's acue was receiving roughly $ 1,000,000 usd per year - to european pro-federalists supporting such organizations as the council of europe , the european coal and steel community , and the proposed european defence community . 
   the end of an article appearing in the daily telegraph in september 2000 noted that : '' * the state department also played a role . 
  a memo from the european section , dated june 11 , 1965 , advises the vice-president of the european economic community , robert marjolin , to pursue monetary union by stealth . 
  it recommends suppressing debate until the point at which `` adoption of such proposals would become virtually inescapable '' * . 
  [ ** as well as this which goes into more detail than wikipedia : ** ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/27/the-european-union-always-was-a-cia-project-as-brexiteers-discov/ )  the schuman declaration that set the tone of franco-german reconciliation - and would lead by stages to the european community - was cooked up by the us secretary of state dean acheson at a meeting in foggy bottom . 
  '' * it all began in washington , * '' said robert schuman 's chief of staff . 
   it was the truman administration that browbeat the french to reach a modus vivendi with germany in the early post-war years , even threatening to cut off us marshall aid at a furious meeting with recalcitrant french leaders they resisted in september 1950 . 
   ________  for british eurosceptics , jean monnet looms large in the federalist pantheon , the emminence grise of supranational villainy . 
  few are aware that he spent much of his life in america , and served as war-time eyes and ears of franklin roosevelt . 
   general charles de gaulle thought him an american agent , as indeed he was in a loose sense . 
  eric roussel 's biography of monnet reveals how he worked hand in glove with successive administrations . 
   it is odd that this magisterial 1000-page study has never been translated into english since it is the best work ever written about the origins of the eu . 
   nor are many aware of declassified documents from the state department archives showing that us intelligence funded the european movement secretly for decades , and worked aggressively behind the scenes to push britain into the project . 
   as this newspaper first reported when the treasure became available , one memorandum dated july 26 , 1950 , reveals a campaign to promote a full-fledged european parliament . 
  it is signed by gen william j donovan , head of the american wartime office of strategic services , precursor of the central inteligence agency . 
   the key cia front was the american committee for a united europe ( * acue * ) , chaired by donovan . 
  another document shows that it provided 53.5 per cent of the european movement 's funds in 1958 . 
  the board included walter bedell smith and allen dulles , cia directors in the fifties , and a caste of ex-oss officials who moved in and out of the cia . 
   papers show that it treated some of the eu 's ' * founding fathers * ' as hired hands , and actively prevented them finding alternative funding that would have broken reliance on washington . 
  hell , we even strongly backed the [ ** european defense community ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_defence_community ) before france killed it . 
  wtf has sweden done but sit out two world wars , refuse to join nato , stay neutral during the cold war & abstain from the euro ? 
  well , i mean , we went from a small coastal backwater who 's republic nobody thought would survive , to a continent-spanning global superpower . 
  we helped save the very same colonial master we broke free from , along with the rest of liberal democratic europe in itself , during the two most destructive wars in human history . 
  we helped support the re-building & integration of europe afterwards , whether speaking economically , militarily or diplomatically , which was utterly essential in fostering the creation of the eu . 
  wtf has sweden done ? 
  i doubt that . 
  simply because the median is already ... the median ... 
   only median income . 
  but ... the united states has a higher [ ** median income ** ] ( http://thismatter.com/money/tax/foreign-earned-income-exclusion.amp.htm ) than pretty much all of western europe ... the only countries that rank higher are luxembourg , norway & switzerland ... none of the big 5 * ( uk , germany , france , spain , italy ) * match it ... 
  with a metric fuckton of oil under them . 
  [ ** that 's not true at all ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income ) according to the oecd , the united states has the 6th highest median wage in the world , behind only luxembourg , norway , sweden & australia . 
  and of the former three european ones , all of their populations combined only come out to about 1/3rd of spain 's , the least populous country of the big 5 * ( germany , uk , france , spain & italy ) * . 
  more tax haven than nation 2 . 
  snow arabs 3 . 
  nazi gold 4 . 
  kangaroo jack only 3 of those countries are european , and all of their populations combined only add up to about 1/3rd of spain , the least populous country of the big 5 * ( germany , france , uk , italy , spain ) * . 
  no , we have a higher [ ** median wage ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income ) than pretty much all of western europe too , including every one of the big 5 . 
   it 's pretty bad in the us the united states has a much higher [ ** median wage ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income ) than pretty much all of europe , including the big 5, 
  deviation from the average do n't mean shit when the purchasing power ot a median wage in itself is so high . 
  it has a [ ** higher median wage ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income ) than pretty much all of western europe too . 
  but that does n't make sense , since america has a higher median wage than almost all of western europe too . 
  all the europeans up in here talking about how in realiity they actually make more one way or another . 
  but that brain drain is real homie . 
  you know it , they know it & i know it . 
  the money going to follow the money . 
  an we have the biggest paychecks , do n't we folks ? 
  the most beautiful paychecks . 
  i credit the industrious nature of atlanta trap stars . 
  the video actually only talks about , and has data on , uk eggs , with no mention of eu regulations or other eu countries , which makes sense given the british lion scheme . 
  too doped up on oxys with my pet gator to get out the door right now unfortunately . 
  i 'm from florida actually . 
   the montana part is homage to gucci bandanna comin ' striaght outta east atlanta like tony montana . 
  blessings of american citizenship . 
  how can you properly regulate the quality of the meat when you ca n't even regulate what the meat is though ? 
  the eu has more estimated cases than that too , but i just included the confirmed cases ... because they 're confirmed ... 
  well , to quote / u/helpmeredditimbored below :  the video says that there has been no study to say which method is better . 
  the data they present only compares england & wales to the entire us , and even they say that it needs to be taken with a large grain of salt ( also it 's mostly the uk egg industry that is talked about , while eu regulations are barely mentioned ), 
  well , i mean , the posted video admits that there has been no peer-reviewed study to say which method is better , and data they present only compares the uk to the us * ( not the eu as a whole ) * , while cautioning about taking to strong & hasty conclusions from it . 
  idk whete the fuck op got his title from though , does n't match the video 's title . 
  well , i mean , it 's not the only example of this kind of thing either .
