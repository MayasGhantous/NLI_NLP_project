  i like this game . 
  lol no , but seriously , are europe federalists seriously so inept & incapable at forging a new national identity for their dream state , that they have to make america the scary foreign boogeyman to unite everybody against ? 
  do n't ya 'll have any home-grown pride or ideals that do n't need a foreign boogeyman ? 
  especially when that boogeyman is your closest ally & a country which played a vital part in the eu 's creation ? 
  pdf for your second figure : http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/publications/eu-summary-report-trends-sources-zoonoses-2013.pdf, 
  so like is this the new federalist plan now ? 
  incapable of forging a strong , home-grown national identity by your own hand , so you attack & pick on america instead ? 
  to forge some kind of foreign boogeyman you can be united in opposition against ? 
  huh . 
  ca n't ya 'll like ... pick on another country that is n't your closest ally who literally played a massive part in helping forge the eu ? 
  or have you become so dominated by american culture that we 're the only viable reference point ? 
  which is fine , but * it is * up to us to sanction non-eu countries for non-eu matters , since these only came about thanks to russian aggression in ukraine & their meddling in our elections . 
  even if we are milking it for that sweet , sweet lng . 
  but we 're not sanctioning eu companies . 
  however ... is nordstream a eu company if gazprom owns 51 % of it & it exists solely to pump gazprom gas ? 
  lol russia owns that shit , and it 's the one supplying that shit . 
  your willingness to start a trade war with us to defend russia & prevent energy diversification is why you scare eastern europe shitless . 
  you ca n't help gazprom build a massive pipeline to pump gazprom gas , and then bitch about america breaking international law when it sanctions gazprom . 
  i mean , nordstream 2 is going to be 51 % owned by gazprom & is going to pump gazprom 's lng . 
  gazprom is a state-owned russian company . 
  thus russia is going to own 51 % of nordstream 2 & it 's going to pump russian gas . 
  so if we 're sanctioning russia , no shit european companies who are entwined with nordstream are going to get hit in the process . 
  you literally let russia own 51 % of the company . 
  lol it 's theirs now . 
  i mean , no wonder eastern europe shit bricks over it ... twice ... western europe is literally willing to ignore their pleas for energy diversification & start a trade war with america to defend a state-owned russia company . 
  what 's your point ? 
  europe should also target russian energy to promote american liquefied national gas exports to europe .

   the measures push u.s.-russia ties into uncharted territory and `` * do n't leave room for the normalization of relations * '' in the foreseeable future , deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said wednesday , according to the interfax news service . 
   hope `` * is dying * '' for improved relations because the scale of `` * the anti-russian consensus in congress makes dialogue impossible and for a long time , * '' konstantin kosachyov , chairman of the international affairs committee in russia 's upper house of parliament , said on facebook . 
  russia should prepare a response to the sanctions that 's `` * painful for the americans , * '' he said . 
   the bill , passed by a vote of 419-3 on tuesday , would strengthen sanctions against russia less than three weeks after president donald trump and his russian counterpart vladimir putin held their first official meeting at the group of 20 summit . 
  the measure , which now goes to the senate , would let congress block any effort by trump to unilaterally weaken sanctions imposed under the obama administration for russian meddling in the 2016 presidential elections and its support for separatists in ukraine . 
  the white house has sent mixed signals about whether trump will sign the bill . 
   __________  the sanctions are `` * pretty sad from the viewpoint of russian-american relations and prospects for developing them , and no less depressing from the perspective of international law and international trade , * '' kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters wednesday on a conference call .
