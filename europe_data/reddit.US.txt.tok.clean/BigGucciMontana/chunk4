  putin will decide on a response if the bill becomes law , he said . 
   trump will sign the law because `` * he 's a prisoner of congress and anti-russian hysteria , * '' alexei pushkov , a senator in russia 's upper house of parliament , said on twitter . 
  the sanctions are `` * a new stage of confrontation , * '' he said . 
   __________  russia has prepared `` * economic and political measures that will be adopted if the senate and trump support the bill , * '' said vladimir dzhabarov , deputy chairman of the international affairs committee in the upper house , the ria novosti news service reported . 
  relations with the u.s. `` * are at such a low level that we have nothing to lose * '' by retaliating , he said . 
   ________  the house vote adds to deepening russian gloom over prospects for a breakthrough in relations , six months after trump took office pledging to improve ties with putin . 
  russia threatened last week to expel u.s. diplomats and seize embassy property in moscow after ryabkov failed to gain agreement at talks in washington for the return of russian diplomatic compounds . 
  even [ ** putin ** ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/27/putin-russia-us-sanctions-bill ) himself called it * `` insolent '' * & vowed retaliation . 
  i 'm sorry we do n't favor the state-owned russian corporation you have building pipelines to pump russian gas . 
  these sanctions are not only much stronger than the last ones * ( explaining juncker 's backlash over it ) * , but the bill that makes them law forces trump to get 's congress 's approval before relaxing either them or the old ones . 
  hence why the white house lobbied against the bill & bitched about it at first so much * ( lots of talk about robbing the wh of `` flexibility '' with the congressional handholding over sanctions ) * . 
  but since it 's probably passing both houses with veto-proof majorities , and is bundled with iran & north korea sanctions , not to mention the pr context of the special consul investigation , trump has been pretty much cornered into supporting it , which he has already announced he 'll do after all the above pressure . 
  so your argument does n't really follow in context . 
  this * will * hurt russia more than anything else . 
  remember who & what is being sanctioned . 
  ah , yes , poor poland & the baltics , too weak & powerless to stand up to bully america over beautiful russian trade & energy dependence , needing mighty germany to protect then . 
  i mean , as we speak , america is forcing them to politically push & economically invest in lng terminals to diversify from russian gas . 
  but luckily , the germans are here to liberate them :  germany and austria lashed out at the proposed sanctions in june , accusing the u.s. of politicizing its economic interest in selling shipments of liquefied natural gas to europe , which would compete with projects like nord stream 2 or the southern gas corridor from the caspian . 
  thank god they have you guys to see through the imperialist mind control & force through shit like nordstream 2 for them . 
  unilateral sanctions against russia for aggression against ukraine & meddling in american elections does not count as inner-eu dealings . 
  you 're asking us to basically clear all unilateral foreign policy on russia through you first , else face retaliation , because you 're dependent on russia & have economic ties with them . 
  and ukraine is not another discussion . 
  ukraine is the reason for the discussion . 
   if you take steps that harm the economic interests of your allies , you should talk to them first and try to get them on board . 
  like i said , eastern europe & scandinavia probably got a point on nordstream 2 . 
  are you trying to annex ukraine & meddle in american elections too ? 
  because that 's the only justification i can see for trying to dictate both ukraine 's foreign policy & the validity of unilateral sanctions by america on a non-eu country . 
  again , non-eu sanctions on a non-eu country for aggression against a non-eu country & meddling in non-eu ar n't under the authority of the eu either . 
  when did ukraine join the eu & when did the eu become the protector of russia ? 
  especially over them meddling in american elections ? 
   that 's not exactly comparable . 
  which is why these sanctions are motivated by ukraine & the election meddling , not that . 
  though ... just for context ... they probably got a point ... 
  well , the sanctions are kinda our business . 
  ukraine is one of our partners , is n't a eu country & you guys basically ignored them when they needed help the most . 
  plus russia did just intefere in our elections . 
  as for the whole energy thing , well , it 's not like you gave a shit when fellow eu member-states in scandinavia & eastern europe objected to it ... so ... eh ... 
  fair enough . 
  western europe 's foreign policy on russia is the same reason that the present ukraine sanctions are pretty short in the tooth anyway , & why the eu in itself was pretty much paralyzed immediately after crimea , forcing america to pretty much handle everything until the infighting could be settled * ( i.e. 
  the famous `` fuck the eu , we 'll go through the un '' remark ) * . 
  so i can see where you 're coming from . 
  i do find it amusing that nordstream & russia sanctions seem to be the one thing that really triggers juncker to start threatening america . 
  lol wtf ? 
  out of all the dumb shit trump has said , a bipartisan sanctions bill against russia for election interference & agression in ukraine , that the white house had to basically be brow beaten into supporting , is where you 're going to take your stand ? 
   the european commission plans to hit back `` * within days * '' at the united states if possible new sanctions against russia , which could be finalized by the end of the month , are agreed upon and leave european energy and other companies vulnerable to u.s. interference . 
   ________  the biggest affected interest would be the mooted nord stream 2 gas pipeline from russia to germany , itself a source of political controversy in the eu , though the commission note says `` * the impact would in reality be much wider . 
  * '' germany and austria lashed out at the proposed sanctions in june , accusing the u.s. of politicizing its economic interest in selling shipments of liquefied natural gas to europe , which would compete with projects like nord stream 2 or the southern gas corridor from the caspian . 
  i feel like if the single market reflected exports like the u.s. internal market does , the american trade deficit would n't look nearly as bad in comparison . 
  a communist society * is * a stateless society though . 
  this is why the soviets , mao , castro , etc. 
  never claimed to have actually achieved communism , only ever claimed to be socialists working * towards * communism . 
  an , tbf , china even changed the socialist thing after mao too . 
  now it 's * `` socialism with chinese characteristics '' * . 
  ya 'll have that triple lock shit for military action in your constitution , do n't you ? 
  would be a kinda difficult situation if the eu intervened somewhere or went to defend something , but the unsc did n't authorize it because of a veto from one of it 's members . 
  kinda creates one hell of a constitutional dilemma for ireland , huh ? 
  lol, 
  ugh ... the dude spent the last decade circlejerking the chavista regime & making heartfelt movies for his newfound comrades & their glorious revolution ... oliver stone has been a useful idiot * for awhile * dude ... 
  that 's literally bullshit though . 
  lol, 
  $ 1.6 trillion in annual exports is nothing ? 
  we pretty much export a entire canada every year . 
  and unlike germany , we do n't count what 's basically internal trade * ( common market/schenegen/eurozone ) * as exports . 
  we actually are by a long-shot when going by nominal . 
  but i actually agree with you because i personally prefer ppp , so meh . 
  than why is this a issue ? 
  how is this in germany 's long-term national interests though ? 
  seems more like germany is more concerned with short-term effects than long-term interests . 
  so germany ca n't stand with us when we sanction russia for intefering in our elections ? 
  lol, 
  lol jesus , was it a cia conspiracy now ? 
  was poor , innocent russia justified with their invasion ? 
  get that dumb shit out of here . 
  if euromaiden happened because america * `` sponsored '' * it , than by that same logic the eu striaght-up organized & micromanaged it . 
  i mean ... do you not remember the condemnations coming from the eu about how the ukranian government was treating the protests ? 
  do you not remember the intention , motivation & whole god damn reason the protests started ? 
  just where were you dude when that shit was going down ? 
  lol and nobody was talking about lethal aid thete . 
  which makes the lack of support & cooperation from the eu to help ukraine that much more infuriating . 
  and just how in the hell did it * `` strengthen '' * america ? 
  it utterly weakened our hand . 
  the un is fucking useless , but we were forced to try & hit back agaunst russia through them because the eu was being , rather impressively , * even more useless than the un * . 
  like dude , when allies give up on you to work with the fucking un of all things ... the writing is on the wall ... 
  are eastern european countries not american allies ? 
  are they not nato member-states ? 
  are they not eu members ? 
  you know , for as much as southern europe bitches about northern europe using germany to economically fuck them , ya 'll sure do n't mind using germany to geopolitically fuck eastern europe . 
  well , if europe does n't like america working with russia through trump , and if europe does n't like america working against russia through obama & the senate , than idk wtf we 're allies for . 
  the trans-atlantic relationship is dead . 
  gerhard schr\u00f6der & donald trump were both right . 
  europe 's destiny is to the east with russia , and america 's destiny is pointed inwards . 
  looking across the atlantic for both was folly . 
  she had a point . 
  the eu helped create the mess by pushing the trade agreement with ukraine in the first place , and when russia invaded they were paralyzed by infighting & did n't want to help america support ukraine , despite america struggling to deal with a chaotic situation that was basically dropped on it 's head . 
  the state department literally had to turn to the useless as shit un to try & forge some progress in helping ukraine instead of being able to work with a close ally who helped create the mess in the first place . 
  so yeah , when it comes to private conversations , * `` fuck the eu , we 'll go through the un '' * is rather appropriate in that scenario . 
  i was n't a fan of his attempt at carpentry , no . 
  ai n't they centre-right ? 
  oh shit yeah ... china is literally outsourcing it 's fucking pollution to africa . 
  lol if only there was some kind of binding international trade agreement which set a precedent for free trade with increased standards & opportunities for green energy in developing countries affected by that sorta arrangement ... like the god damn tpp which populists from around the world trashed & demanded be scrapped .
