your government did the right thing . 
  the rights of the minority were trampled on , so the government responded accordingly . 
  i find the comparisons to italy kind of weird , since yes , they do drink coffee all the time , but the thing is , that coffee is in little cups . 
  the same thing used to happen in the more gay-friendly countries , though . 
  eventually , the attitude of the public shifts toward acceptance . 
  ugh , snowblowers . 
  in the neighborhood i previously lived in , i could look out my bedroom window over the next street and there was a guy on that street who would fucking snowblow as little as 2 inches / 5 cm of snow off his driveway . 
  every time it snowed i could count on hearing at least his snowblower in the morning . 
  way to go , serbia ... 
  meanwhile when i was in croatia , i saw the gay pride parade in zagreb . 
  a bunch of people participated , it was heavily police-protected , and looked like it went perfectly . 
  yes i do know about the referendum they had , but this is still how you set a good example . 
  i absolutely love washington . 
  i do wish my parents did n't move us away right after i was born , but of course i 'm also very happy here in co. 
  i 'm in the us but i hope you accept a list from my state . 
  * colorado * 1 .

  and of course ... [ craft beer ] ( http://www.travelenvogue.com/app/webroot/img/userfiles/craft%20beer.jpg ), 
  i did exactly that in zagreb ; walked down ilica just enjoying everything around me . 
  it was very neat !, 
  i loved zagreb and croatia . 
  i did n't go to the southern part , so someday i 'll be back for that . 
  sounds like he 'd love somalia . 
  the us a blight on humanity ; how delusional does one have to be to honestly believe that ? 
  i guess it 'd be easy for russians since , like you said , they get misinformed . 
  very small , alpine country that seems very much like a little fun-sized version of its neighbor switzerland . 
  its capital city is vaduz . 
  because switzerland and austria are both landlocked , liechtenstein is doubly landlocked . 
  was actually `` accidentally invaded '' by the swiss army during poor weather . 
  before joining shengen , it did share open borders with switzerland . 
  a nice , well-kept little place !, 
  i made sure to drive through and set foot on its soil while traveling from switzerland to austria so i would be able to say i 've been to liechtenstein . 
  that 's blatantly false . 
  in the usa there are also large disparities like the ones seen in this map . 
  i do n't know how reliable `` tns polska '' is , but in 2011 they reported 54 % of poles agree that same-sex couples should have legal recognition and 27 % support full same-sex marriage . 
  numbers that are a little low but no doubt better than what they could be . 
  it 's very true , i can see it happen all the way from the us . 
  it is the same here , to an extent . 
  lots of arabs in our universities . 
  but i 'm sure you guys still think the influx in immigrants from the middle east is at least kind of annoying because they all bring their intolerant religion with them . 
  it 's like an average conservative american voluntarily moving to canada in search of a `` better life '' and then going off about how horrible they think socialized healthcare is and how it would be better if things were like how they are back home . 
  good read . 
  i love everyone surprised at # 4.50 for a pint . 
  where i live , if you want real beer - good beer - it 's $ 5 to $ 7 per pint . 
  $ 4 if you 're lucky . 
  yeah , but i 'm talking big mountains like where i 'm from . 
  germany has those too , but only way down south on the border . 
  true ; it depends on your priorities . 
  i 'm a professional in a tourist town and do n't earn as much as i would in denver , but that 's okay . 
  i 'm actually in the mountains instead of battling the gridlock traffic from the city to get here every friday evening . 
  it amazes me they 'd pass through such an amazing place just to go live in some concrete jungle in germany . 
  my life revolves around the outdoors though so i may be a bit biased . 
  do you guys have room for an entry level engineer from the us ? 
  i happened to be in zagreb last year when they marched . 
  i was just watching it , and police made me show id because they thought i was some gay-basher . 
  but i 'm gay ... 
  i 'm hourly , but i 'll use last month 's pay as an average . 
  job : entry level civil engineer ( eit ) , 6 months in and 1 year out of college . 
  40-45h week . 
  net : $ 3457 * ira deduction : - $ 104 * tax deductions : - $ 782 take home : $ 2571 * rent ( all-inclusive ) : - $ 1000 * car insurance : - $ 150 * phone : - $ 50 * food/other grocery : - $ 200 that leaves me with $ 1171 for saving , gas , eating out , and other `` fun . '', 
  certain food items seem to be cheap in countries like germany compared to here . 
  my local grocery store only just lowered the zucchini price to $ 1/lb , or 2 eur/kg . 
  i think it 's only a seasonal price . 
  used to be $ 1.70 / lb or 3.30 eur/kg . 
  same deal with the potatoes . 
  0.45 eur/kg comes out to like 23 cents per pound . 
  i pay 79 cents !, 
  this is for a national chain ( kroger , but our local variation is called city market ) . 
  if i go to the independent grocery down the road , it 's more expensive . 
  small prices , but it adds up . 
  if you think that 's bad , you should see the sheer amount of people in my country who believe that . 
  we do have plenty of those too , particularly in the west close to the border with utah , the mormon utopia . 
  but muh beautiful mountains !, 
  mine was from veneto . 
  it seems to stand out among other northern regions in terms of how many people left for the americas . 
  [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/98/12/9e/98129e90172a13d796c0f98ccf84f898.jpg ) really could be practically any guy from colorado , usa . 
  pretty simple . 
  my part of the us is on par with italy . 
  not bad i suppose . 
  yes !, 
  definitely take it . 
  i had a great time in mine . 
  that 's interesting ; for me , learning beginner german was very simple , and i 'd always heard that german as a whole is one of the easier languages to learn for native english speakers . 
  perhaps it is much more difficult for those whose native language is n't a germanic one , which would make sense . 
  `` america '', 
  having american flair does n't guarantee automatic downvotes anymore , so that 's nice . 
  wyoming is a bit backwards but not like mississippi . 
  most of wyoming is a modern-day version of the old `` wild west '' except for the northwest corner near jackson , which is a left-leaning resort area with lots of skiing and money . 
  the northeast part of the state is very oil-driven . 
  as a whole , the state is pretty wealthy because of natural resources , and to a lesser extent , tourism . 
  it 's really sad . 
  : / dammit , i did n't even think i had that wrong !, 
  yes , definitely cbsa . 
  canada takes their border control probably more seriously than even we do . 
  maybe it 's a little because of * where * i crossed , but i was driving from montana into alberta and have colorado plates .
