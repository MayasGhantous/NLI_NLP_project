nobody is talking about your friends . 
  are you so limited you can not process , in your brain , the separation of denouncing an idea rather than denouncing every person who may hold the denounced idea ? 
  how the hell can you not understand that ? 
  please , go argue this campaign of yours with someone who is saying `` muslims are xyz . '', 
  i am saying islam , christianity , and judaism suck . 
  each with a terrible history on earth and none showing any actual benefit to humanity since these ignorant superstitious myths about an incestuous iraqi were invented . 
  and to top if off , we do n't need these religions . 
  if we had to have religion as a species to survive , then maybe we should have it . 
  yet we do n't . 
  and we definitely do n't need these 3 worthless religions which have heaped nothing but misery on the world for the last 2-3k years . 
  and how do you reply ? 
  you reply with repeated name calling and f.s.j.w.d. 
  - frustrated social justice warrior disorder . 
  you reply in self serving righteousness against an argument i did n't make and an argument you apparently are n't able to understand . 
  well played . 
  you 're a funny little sjw , - still typical though . 
  refuses to read what was written without projecting her own issues into another 's post . 
   who is really practicing the founder 's faith ? 
  the men who run around slaughtering , marrying little girls , beheading others ( all as their muhammad did ) ; or the ones who try the propaganda `` islam , religion of peace ? '', 
  and this is your answer ? 
  name calling ? 
  and `` a few people '' . 
  yes throughout history ( west civ ) we only see a few examples of religion doing wrong , right ? 
  really , before using a term such as a moron ... ** edit ** wow , the poster 's a brit . 
  on a day when her fellow englishmen and women are making arrangements to bring home their dead kin , brits killed in tunisia ; here is an enlightened ( though it is probably not appropriate to label one who is so adamant about myths as enlightened ) here reminding us all again `` it is n't islam 's fault they are dead , even though islam 's founder would have killed them too . '', 
   but the actions of a few i damn the entire histories of these ignorant iraqi religions . 
  look at history my friend and tell me catholic church abuses were `` actions of a few '' . 
  then look at the history of christianity and tell me terrible things have only been done in the name of christianity by `` a few '' . 
  and judaism - it 's secrets are a little less open but once you see what it has done as well , well then you wo n't be tossing uninformed claims about `` actions of a few . '', 
  around . 
  time to get over the niceness with you people . 
  your myths are false and the world is really tired of dealing with these 3 abrahamic pain in the asses . 
  the same 3 abrahamic pain in the asses which have historically delivered nothing of value to this world but have increased the misery that humanity must continually fight to live through . 
  are you generally this rude and stupid or was this an exception ? 
  not only is my post `` true '' in the sense european governments do track people down and arrest them for saying offensive things on the internet ; my post was also supposed to be read with a bit of a sarcastic , rather than literal , tone . 
  i said  seek opportunity to speak out against islam , judaism , and christianity notice the difference between that sentence and the following , please - * seek opportunity to speak out against muslims , jews , and christians . 
  now , fuck islam . 
  a religion founded by a child rapist , a mass murderer , a thief , and an egoist who would have chopped your head off if you refused to submit . 
  who is really practicing the founder 's faith ? 
  the men who run around slaughtering , marrying little girls , beheading others ( all as their muhammad did ) ; or the ones who try the propaganda `` islam , religion of peace ? '', 
  in ending , i suggest not pushing your sensitives into my postings again . 
  do not project your own ideas into my words . 
  i very clearly stated the religions were the problem . 
  i made no mention of people . 
   i am deeply disappointed in many members of this sub . 
  why ? 
  i would be more disappointed in people who do n't believe these abrahamic faiths which have delivered such misery to the world should be heavily denounced . 
  we should seek opportunity to speak out against islam , judaism , and christianity ; not quiet down when one of the three delivers a pile of shit into the world . 
  europeans need to be careful . 
  their government ( they only have one that counts now ) will track them down and arrest them for offending islam so maybe the mods just do n't want to go to jail ? 
  hey chum , learn the definition of editorialized yet ? 
  haha , so now mentioning a person 's nationality ( as reported in the article ) is nazi ? 
  gee , here is how the article reads -  israeli-born ilan shor , one of the richest people in an impoverished country , denies any involvement in a secret takeover and looting of three banks sorry bloke but it seems you ca n't use the nazi denouncement here in defense of the thieving israeli banker . 
  all information is taken directly from article . 
  thanks though , have an enjoyable night . 
  and this is exactly what these international bankers do . 
  they get settled into your lands and they then drain the wealth from your lands . 
  this man , his cousin , his uncle , and his brother thank you and your elected politicians for allowing them to do as they do . 
  a majority wo n't even see this reality . 
  too busy not wanting to offend any particular group of people while that particular group of people rob the coffers , right ? 
  may as well let travellers have open room and board at the house , that is what we 've done is n't it ; done given the fox the henhouse with allowing these people to seize and then control our nation 's financial systems . 
   some people in / r/news [ 1 ] and / r/worldnews [ 2 ] were already saying stuff like that though . 
  even the police officer said that what happened was n't related to terrorism . 
  it could be muslims and not related to terrorism unless you believe all crime related to muslims is terrorism . 
  is that what you believe ? 
  sorry for the delayed response but my post meant to refer to the government and not the average person . 
  i apologize for not wording the post in a proper manner . 
   lets for example take d-day . 
  many people think that mainly was an american operation . 
  well , it was n't . 
  3/5 beaches were taken by british/commonwealth soldiers . 
  2/3 of the airplanes and ships used in the invasion were british . 
   there were 73,000 american soldiers involved , and 83,000 british . 
  no offense here but the brits walked on to the beaches while the u.s. and canada fought their way on . 
  if this sounds familiar to those familiar with how the brits use other nation 's men to die first it 's because this is familiar to how the brit 's have others go first , go hardest . 
  turks , indians , aussies , irish , canadians , and quite a few other nations have experienced this british tendency . 
  did n't moldova just have 1b $ stolen from its purse ? 
  something like ~ ~ 1/7th ~ ~ 1/5th of the nation 's entire reserve just disappeared ? 
  edit - yes . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/05/us-moldova-corruption-banks-iduskbn0nq1xd20150505 - 20 % of that nation 's money , gone . 
   democracy at work right there , luckily ** it later was shot down by the federal goverment ** that 's a republic at work right there and this is why the u.s. is not a democracy . 
   i feel that the communist party enjoys a lot of legitimacy based on the fact that it is able to provide rapid economic growth and benefits for most . 
   the think you are making a mistake about is that you think that 80 % european orgins means that 80 % of ashkenazi jews are completely european . 
  i know exactly what it means . 
  i word my message fitting the manner i want my meaning to appear . 
  the way my meaning appears in the message is absolutely correct . 
   what it really means is that a small group of jews married a small group of roman woman . 
  roman is n't known . 
  what is known is the women who were integrated were n't 1 ) jews 2 ) semitic 3 ) of near eastern ( ne ) origin but were 1 ) part of a lineage that traced back into european ( e ) history some 12k years . 
  this means 80 % of all jewish europeans are descended from 4 women who descended solely from prehistoric europe . 
  as an atheist i do n't often reference the bible . 
  in this discussion it is a must . 
  the bible is clear is its genealogy : those who are to posses israel must be descended from the lineage of abraham who descended from the lineage of shem . 
  europeans , according to the bible , are not descended from the line which carries abraham but are instead descended from japeth . 
  religiously the rules are clear - if you are n't from the line of shem and descended from abraham , no israel for you . 
  also , there is a part in the ot about the fake jews coming to claim israel . 
  so we 've covered a bit of science and religion - both areas clearly state european jews have no business in israel taking land from people actually descended from the land and mentioned how the bible warns of the imposter coming to claim the land - science backing the bible ? 
  im sure a religious loon could make the argument it does . 
  anyone could rightfully make the argument , yet only the religious loon would really believe that the bible stories are real . 
  non zealots would see it as the appreciated coincidence that it is .
