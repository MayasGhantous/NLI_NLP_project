  it subdued nationalist tendencies in republics , but the government itself did not have any particular nationalism . 
  how could it ? 
  the politburo itself was n't any one ethnicity ( though russians dominated it ) . 
  stalin was not a world revolution activist , fyi . 
  trotsky was . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism_in_one_country ), 
  i 'm still disappointed that kruschev never got a chance to go there . 
  i would have loved pictures from that . 
  it 's simply because romania did n't present a threat to moscow . 
  they were still communist . 
  they still shared many of the same geopolitical interests . 
  they were still in the warsaw pact . 
  they were still a dictatorship . 
  it 's simply not worth it for the soviets to come in and invade for every little disagreement . 
  the soviets were brutally repressive , but not * that * repressive . 
  compare this with the 1956 hungarian revolution : moscow was n't really wanting to invade until announcements from hungary said they were leaving the warsaw pact and were having free elections . 
  even after it was put down , hungary 's implementation of many free marketish reforms and comparatively good standards of living were tolerated because they did n't geopolitically threaten the ussr . 
  sure , there 's always a guy with a gun , but you 're comparing two completely different countries with completely different forms of government decades apart from each other . 
  you 'll notice that they had bulletproof glass there , so it 's not like they did n't forsee * some * idiot doing something . 
  it also looks like the guy was a long distance away if the grenade only came within 60 feet of bush . 
  anyway , my point was that there was none of this in romania . 
  there were no ethnic groups there that had any reason to do anything , and the government had nothing to gain by doing something either . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's impossible in other cases . 
  i 'm just saying that a host country for a foreign head of state spends a lot of resources to make sure that nothing happens to them , because it shows your country is unstable or your government colluded to kill them . 
  neither of which looks good at all . 
  the diplomatic crisis that would fall out of such an event would be enormous . 
  pretty sure romania would be on top of putting down any assassination attempts . 
  there 's a reason why it 's unheard of for heads of state to die during foreign visits . 
  no underground or official romanian organization had any reason to do this anyway . 
  it 's not like the us had just bombed romania or blatantly helped the regime with oppressing the people , and they would n't gain anything out of any assassination anyway . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  this makes much more sense now . 
   fucking up our codfish supply not to sound like a dick , but did n't you guys already fuck up your cod supply ( i.e. 
  the atlantic cod ) ? 
  i was wondering how a norwegian fish became a portuguese traditional food , and then i read about the atlantic cod and got sad : /, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg02nw8oxlk ), 
  thanks . 
  would this have any symbolic meaning like the title implies , or is this just one of those gifts that heads of state give to each other during visits and does n't mean anything ? 
  i really wish he was named `` banana fartman '' now , just so i could hear it in the news all the time : /, 
  to be fair , i do n't think he has a choice in the matter . 
  dictators are a product of their environment . 
  as the article says , if he were to come out tomorrow as wanting to join the eu , russia will economically cripple them and probably do some other not-so-nice things to the country . 
  sticking with just russia will doom it to always being a impoverished puppet state . 
  there is a balancing act inherent in that so you * have * to play both sides for your benefit . 
  of course , i 'm sure the situation suited the dictator just fine for a while too . 
  i have no idea what that is . 
  wish i could say the same about the ones in the us . 
  they are outright despised in some areas because of their behavior . 
  the energy and manufacturing industries are smarter than that . 
  if you try to strong arm them , they will just pack up and leave and do the same shit , just in a different area , or find some other way to avoid being ordered around . 
  it 's not a smart way to try to solve the problem . 
  in the end for things like renewables to be successful you need many of these players to be stakeholders in it so they benefit as well . 
  i 'm not saying that 's what is going on here : there is a lot to be concerned about just based on the information in the article . 
  i 'm just saying that talking to the industry and trying to work out something for everyone is n't necessary a bad thing by itself . 
  nato membership too . 
  to be fair , if you want to do work on climate change , you are going to need the cooperation of heavy industry and energy providers . 
  it 's the content of the discussions that are what need to be known , not necessarily the time spent , though 94 % is a bit much . 
  ok , i see what you 're trying to say now . 
  however , i think the voters who think there was more to this are wrong . 
  i do n't see how it suits fidesz to keep the rest of the tapes secret if they reflect something worse than what was published . 
  it would have completely destroyed gyurcsany 's credibility further than it had been already . 
  gyurcsany would know this as well , which is why i ca n't see him making up another speech that was different from what was actually said . 
  so did an impersonator [ do this ] ( https://youtu.be/z4jtk9sib_o ) then ? 
   the whole speech has never been publicised btw , only that single sentence . 
  what ? 
  that [ does n't seem to be true ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferenc_gyurcs%c3%a1ny%27s_speech_in_balaton%c5%91sz%c3%b6d_in_may_2006 ) at all . 
  just a quick search on youtube has the entire audio of the speech . 
  i do n't think anyone seriously thought that the communists states were economically competitive with the west during this time . 
  all you had to do was go across the curtain to see this first hand . 
  i went in 1989 to hungary ( which was considered one of the best performing eastern bloc countries ) and i felt like i had traveled back in time by about 50 years , and i was only 8 years old . 
  it was the military that the west was concerned about , and that was competitive ( not to mention that nukes made any conventional military fight obsolete anyway ) . 
  i do n't think you can say `` this earthquake was unequivocally caused by fracking '' . 
  that 's like saying `` this hurricane was caused by climate change '' . 
  that 's simply not possible to say . 
  however , it is [ suspected that a 5.6 earthquake ] ( http://users.clas.ufl.edu/prwaylen/geo2200%20readings/readings/fracking/earthquakes%20and%20fracking.pdf ) that ~ ~ killed ~ ~ injured ( edit : my bad , i misread that ) two people and destroyed some homes was caused by fracking wastewater disposal . 
  i 'm just saying that there is a measured increase in earthquakes and magnitudes since fracking has started , and that many of the processes that fracking interacts with are not well understood . 
  is it my understanding that if fracking was done `` properly '' , many of these problems would n't exist . 
  in those cases , i would say that yeah , fracking sounds great . 
  my problem is that these safeguards are not being followed . 
  if i am completely wrong on this , i would be more than happy to read up on it . 
   and regardless , there have never been earthquakes that strong from fracking anyway it 's funny how you did n't include the sentences right after that :  `` yet , wastewater disposal by injection into deep wells poses a higher risk , because this practice can induce larger earthquakes . 
  for example , several of the largest earthquakes in the u.s. midcontinent in 2011 and 2012 may have been triggered by nearby disposal wells . 
  the largest of these was a magnitude 5.6 event in central oklahoma that destroyed 14 homes and injured two people ''  earthquakes are measured on a log base 10 scale , so a five is a lot smaller than a 6 which is tiny compared to a 7 , etc. 
  is oklahoma built to withstand 5-scale earthquakes ? 
  i know california is , obviously . 
  seeing as how people have already ~ ~ died ~ ~ injured ( misread that ) from a 5.6 earthquake and several homes were destroyed , my guess is `` no '' . 
   there are a lot of very wealthy and powerful interests with a massive vested interest in slowing or stopping fracking i do n't disagree at all , but let 's face it , there are a larger number of environmental consequences to it than the normal drilling . 
  can these be mitigated ? 
  my understanding is yes . 
  if these were properly mitigated , then i would support it without reservation because we need to move off of coal yesterday . 
  but it appears that regulators are looking the other way , or that it 's not as easy as it seems . 
  that depends on whether the building is built to withstand earthquakes . 
  a 5 in california ? 
  does n't even register for anyone . 
  a 5 in indiana ? 
  that would cause moderate amounts of damage . 
  for the most part , yes , but more major ones of 5 + are becoming more common as well . 
  it 's also not clearly understood how this will affect earthquakes in the future or how it will destabilize the fault line . 
  they do n't even know if the earthquakes will stop if they stopped fracking altogether . 
  [ it is n't ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/us/oklahoma-acknowledges-wastewater-from-oil-and-gas-wells-as-major-cause-of-quakes.html?_r=0 ) oklahoma used to have 2-3 earthquakes/year , and since fracking has started that has gone to about 600 .
