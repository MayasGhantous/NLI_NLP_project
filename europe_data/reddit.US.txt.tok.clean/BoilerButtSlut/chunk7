   wankshaft this is my new favorite word . 
   my ( first-generation ) indian-american uncle asked me that exact same question about gps when he was visiting . 
  :| i 've seen americans bring out their phone and start to show it to someone new to the us saying things like `` have you ever seen one of these ? 
  '' , and questioning if they had electricity in their town . 
  they were from europe . 
   oh , i 've heard of this , is it all that true ? 
  yes . 
  seriously , do n't say it unless it 's in a private group and you explain to them that it means something different . 
  even then , i 'd be careful . 
  this word would be an instant firing from most jobs if directed to a woman , or an instant ass-kicking from a husband/boyfriend . 
  most guys would probably just look at you weird or be mildly offended ( it does n't make sense to say this to a man ) , but it 's still not a great idea because it 's so easy to be taken the wrong way . 
  i 've never heard it asked in that way in a household . 
  it 's always `` where is your bathroom ? '', 
  however , `` do you have a bathroom ? '', 
  is not unusual if you are wanting to use the bathroom of a retail store , as they may not have a public facility and you may need to go somewhere else for one . 
  edit : it could be a regional quirk , so it might not be unusual , i 've just never heard it where i live . 
  yes , this is correct . 
  i was just trying to formulate a general rule . 
  other than maybe seeming a little weird , a polite person is n't going to be bothered anywhere . 
  in some other places , a person cursing or talking shit is going to get the crap beat out of them . 
  it 's better to just start being polite first and then go down from there as the situation warrants . 
  related story : my one friend had a post-doc in germany and basically got to live there for a year or two . 
  before he left , he was talking with a german friend of his and asking about the do/don ` ts , much like this thread . 
  other than the obvious stuff mentioned above , he was told if he is solving a problem in front of someone , to never say '' ... and the final solution is ... '' . 
  in a similar vein , i asked him to find out if it was taboo to do an expansion on a house and call the expansion more `` lebensraum '' . 
  apparently that is ok . 
  russia still does internal passports ? 
  i thought those ended with the soviet union . 
  nice try at reverse psychology , tourism minister of serbia . 
  that 's for the british . 
  i thought you danes were supposed to slap people with pickled herring when upset . 
  ** do n't ** criticize the military . 
  you can say whatever you want about foreign policy , but the people and soldiers are sacrosanct . 
  ** do n't ** get insulted if someone has never heard of your country , confuses yours for another one , does idiotic stereotypes about it , or asks retarded questions ( ie . 
  `` wow !, 
  you have an iphone ? 
  do they have those in your country '' ? ) . 
  most people are just terribly informed about the world . 
  ** do ** talk about your country as long as you 're not a douchebag about it . 
  they love to hear how other countries live . 
  if you making friends or are staying with a host , give them something that 's indicative of your country . 
  the easiest thing is money ( small bills/change , obviously ) . 
  americans very rarely see foreign money and are always excited to see or get some . 
  ** do n't ** fuck around with the police . 
  if you are pulled over , ** do not get out of the god damn car unless told to ** . 
  do exactly as you are told , and do n't make sudden motions or put your hands where the police ca n't see them . 
  be polite . 
  do not offer bribes . 
  if the cop is obviously wrong , other than saying that you think they 're wrong , do n't argue . 
  it 's not worth the trouble . 
  you can fight it later in court if needed . 
  ** do n't ** assume you can go topless on a beach if you 're female . 
  ** do n't ** rely on public transportation outside of big cities . 
  it 's almost universally terrible . 
  get a rental car or just fly . 
  ** do ** take advantage of hospitality . 
  if someone offers you something , you do n't need to play the back and forth yes-no game they are n't doing it hoping that you 'll say no ( not usually at least ) . 
  ** do ** be polite . 
  lots of people ( especially in the south ) take politeness seriously . 
  cursing loudly in public or with people you do n't know is bad form ( unless it 's an extremely casual environment or expected ) . 
  `` cunt '' is also probably the absolute worst word you can say , especially to a woman . 
  do n't use it in public or with people who wo n't understand the context . 
  ** do ** feel free to talk to people . 
  as long as they are n't busy with something , they will usually chat . 
  ** do ** feel safe . 
  we have a bad reputation as being unsafe , but really , unless you 're being stupid in a terrible neighborhood , you 're extremely safe and wo n't get shot or something . 
  ** do n't ** be an asshole . 
  because nuclear is not something that can set up and dissaembled quickly ( so not short term ) , and because a practical replacement is likely ~ 50-100 years away ( so it 's not a permanent or long-term solution ) that was my thinking anyway . 
  maybe i could have used better wording . 
  us is considered the guardian of security in the former eastern bloc . 
  and the us does n't impose government or ideology on the country . 
  that 's why you wo n't find the us really unpopular even if the foreign policy leaves a lot to be desired . 
  well , it means it 's greener in that it 's not emitting co2 and other pollutants . 
  it 's in the same way that iceland is greener because it 's sitting on a huge volcano that they can extract energy from . 
  i completely agree . 
  nuclear in the middle-term is the way to go until something suitable can replace it . 
  it 's a shame the greens there are still against it . 
  the tide seems to be turning in the us in favor of it . 
  only 20-30 years ago , it was politically impossible to get a nuclear power approved expanded , and now the greens are started to get so terrified of climate change that they are willing to live with it as a compromise . 
  hah , do n't worry about it . 
  i 'm not sure why everyone is making a big deal . 
  i did n't think it was an unreasonable opinion . 
  hydro is a necessary component of green policy-making though . 
  none of the current renewable favorites like solar , wind , etc can sustain a baseload electrical demand . 
  even in the ideal case of 100 % renewable generation during the day , you still need to keep a coal-fired plant running so it can take over during the evening . 
  hydro can fulfill that role . 
  i agree that it 's extremely geography-dependent , though . 
  i understand your point with the flair . 
  i actually do n't use the hungarian one exactly because of this , and because i do n't want people to get the wrong idea when i comment on things . 
  but i 'm not sure how i fit into this : i already had us flair and was n't misrepresenting anything at all . 
  is it because the topic is what a person thinks of their own country 's anthem ? 
  i mean , i hear both anthems in roughly equal amounts in an everyday basis due to the hungarian community where i live . 
  because it 's a european sub , and i do n't have a strong enough opinion on the american one to really say anything about it . 
  i 'm american by birth and live in the us . 
  both my parents are hungarian , however . 
  [ related ? 
  a former british colony , the democratic african republic of hungary , perhaps ? 
  hungary is high proficiency ? 
  if my family is any indication , i 'd say it 's a proficiency rate of about 20 % , with almost all of that being under 30 years old . 
  outside of tourist areas , it 's non-existent .
