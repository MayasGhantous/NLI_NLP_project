well , guantanamo does n't suit your fancy . 
  how about adx florence , 23/7 solitary confinement for the first year ( at the very minimum ) if determined to be a danger to others . 
  you start chewing off your fingernails by the end of the first month or bob 's your uncle . 
  got it . 
  thanks . 
  american here , misdemeanors are n't crimes in hungary ? 
  also , because nobody cares , we are taking a token amount , 8k or so . 
   and if american media or politicians start with human rights / ethics bullshit , we should say `` ok , for every 1000 you take , we take another 1000 '' . 
  implying people in the us would care enough about the `` human rights crisis '' to do more than just donating some spare change . 
  well , good luck getting them airline tickets and proper paper work to send them here ... kapppaaa . . that 's the great thing about being bordered by two oceans and a long border of desert . 
   strange , is n't it . 
  not really ? 
  its like you making fun of your siblings or family but taking offense at strangers doing the same thing . 
  man , its so weird seeing people having such an adverse reaction to the solitary confinement . 
  the only reason i can see it happening is if china does something really stupid and actually creates a situation where japan can unequivocally invoke the us-japan security treaty . 
  i doubt we would be enthusiastically enter on japan 's side if they were the one that escalated the mess . 
  the ffl march is pretty nice . 
  katyusha , farewell of slavankia , and polyushke polye . 
  we already have an auxiliary pacific fleet , its called the ~ ~ ijn ~ ~ jmsdf . 
  dayone, 
  and its certainly not the only us unit to adopt the symbols of the country where it 's stationed . 
  many us units in japan have the rising sun on its unit patches . 
  your flair says us . 
  should n't you know what at will employment is already ? 
  unless the us social welfare system gets a massive overhaul , i would also be against nordic prisons in the us . 
  why should criminals be able to live better lives and have access to more resources ( education and training ) than regular law abiding citizens . 
  wow ... damn ... that shit sounds nice . 
  1 % of japan 's nominal gdp is still a fairly substantial chunk of change . 
  too be fair , for some essentials , the japanese do try to maintain domestic capability . 
  if they ca n't make it , they 'll license produce it . 
  they will not by mots ( off the shelf ) . 
  the f-2 was an absurdly expensive strike fighter ( due low unit production , but excessive r&d , i.e. 
  first fighter with aesa and large amounts of composites ) , it 's purpose was to maintain indigenous capability so as they would n't be completely in the lerch should the worst happens . 
  same with their new service rifle , the howa type 89 has a ridiculous per unit price as their only users are the jsdf . 
  iirc , their new akizuki class ddgs also use a domestic fire control radar . 
  i did n't know the us was allied to any country prior to ww1 and ww2 ... oh wait . . we were n't . 
  yet , we were pretty far from neutral both times ( `` neutrality '' patrols my ass ) . 
  plus , all that logistical support we gave the russians once the war started . 
  depends on how you much you weigh power projection ( as the japanese fleet is constitutionally a `` defense '' only force ) and nuclear deterrent . 
  because in tonnage of surface combatants , the jmsdf clocks in at 413k to the royal navy 's 367k . 
  plus numbers of awds and swcs also . 
  6 type 45s for the uk vs 6 + ( 2 planned ) aegis ddgs for the japanese vs 3 +3 rokn kdx-iii aegis ddgs batch 1 & 2 ( mind you the japanese kongos/atagos [ 96 ] and korean ddgs [ 128 +8 ] all have more vls cells than the type 45 [ 48 ] ) . 
  plenty of genpurp dds and frigates for japan also , although only the 4 akizukis ( all 4 commissioned by 2014 ) of them are `` modern '' like the planned type 26 . 
  plus the whole nimrod maritime patrol craft debacle for the uk and having a period of no maritime patrol assets available compared to the 80 + p-3cs and p-1s for the japanese . 
  of course , once the qes are properly fitted out and equipped with their air groups , the rn will be undisputedly `` more powerful '' than the rokn and jmsdf . 
  we have that in us prisons ... well ... its more of a nutraloaf thing ... 
  technically , adx florence also has an area called `` z unit/the black hole '' . 
  inmates can be fully restrained to the concrete bed and the room itself is completely dark and soundproof . 
  normal solitary iirc is just 23 hour isolation . 
  with 1 hour of exercise time in a cage . 
  cells with windows to disorient the inmates ( i.e. 
  showing only sky , no landscape ) . 
  they can attempt to talk to fellow inmates by yelling via the plumbing ( rumor iirc ) . 
  tv for lessons and religious stuff . 
  minimal conversation with guards and staff ( for example , sgt might ask when they want their excercise hour , nurse might ask general health stuff ) . 
  http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/25/us/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-supermax-prison/ there 's a reason why the warden of adx calls it a `` clean version of hell '' . 
  meh , i should care ... but then i do n't really . 
  florence especially . 
  since those in the solitary wing are usually there for multiple life sentences ( which means rehabilitation is already out of the question ) , or for the protection of the guards/themselves . 
  i would understand a laxer more rehabilitative approach to petty criminals . 
  but for stuff that warrants capital punishment or life in prison ? 
  well , those prison 's could be like devil 's island and i could n't be bothered to give a shit . 
  we do n't have to kill him literally , we can do it figuratively . 
  florence 's solitary wing is pretty damn close to a modern day oubliette . 
  throw him in solitary in adx for his own `` protection '' for the rest of his life . 
  we 'll have him amputating his own scrotum in a ~ ~ year ~ ~ decade .

  man , he would love adx florence . 
  we should have a prisoner exchange . 
   the finnish navy is a self defense force unlike most nato navies which are used for expeditionary tasks . 
  just because its a self defense force does n't mean it ca n't be swag . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3wtucpwmei https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dribyqvg_4 mind you these were found to be unpopular and apparently did n't work all that well  `` we 've been phasing out the global force for good tagline over the past year , '' said cmdr. 
  chris servello , spokesman for the chief of naval personnel . 
  `` it 's not that we are n't a global force for good , but rather that the tagline alone does n't capture all of who we really are , as a navy , that led to the decision to phase it out over time . '', 
  replaced with this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thimmln-i8s and a bonus , a perennial classic an old 90s jmsdf ( totally not a navy ) ad https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjrif7phyo0 the japanese at the end means : love japan ? 
  love peace ? 
  maritime self defense force but now replaced with things more like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4weguuq_ck, 
   but the us should take in a decent portion of these refugees ha . . ha ... ha.hahahaha . . well , they can try getting in boats and try a transatlantic run then . . cause there is no political will to take them in voluntarily . 
   zero awacs to give those typhoons a mobile , long range radar platform to help it protect hundreds of square miles at any given time . 
  wait what ... even japan with a far more restrictive anti-war constitution has 4 e767s and a dozen hawkeyes ... 
  polish investigators were part of the original investigation also iirc . 
  there was a canadian documentary on it . 
   ty for your service 07 not military ... but yea , pretty damn awesome yea ? 
  our new carrier is going to have electro-magnetic catapults and expansion space to put on dews if they ever become viable . 
  well ... yea . . but do you have this ... http://cdn.rsvlts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/awvktlr.jpg i think not , checkmate yurop . 
  teddy did n't seem to like the russians all too much ...  `` the russians think only with half a mind ... i think that japanese will whip them handsomely . '', 
  learning from the best . 
  i do n't think he meant best `` armed forces '' ( meaning overall strength ) but `` best armed '' forces ( i.e. 
  one of the best equipped ) which is accurate in a `` general sense '' , except for the jgsdf . 
  jasdf has more awacs than germany , but admitedly is facing a fighter crunch barring faster f-35 and f-3 procurement . 
  jmsdf is one of the few country with aegis ( plus apparently , they 're extremely well integrated w. the usn in terms of interoperatbility ) , and has one of the strongest martime airborne surveilance/asw arms outside of the us . 
  the jgsdf apart from its qrfs , amphbat , airbat , and armored division is fairly behind in terms of t.o.e iirc . 
  some of the non-frontline formations are still equiped with the type 64 and cold-war era body armor . 
  you would n't think he was some uber islamic type guy based off of that pbs report on him . 
   or am i missing something ? 
  is this like the american ` correspondent 's dinner ' , or whatever it 's called ? 
  pretty much , except its a weekly thing ( approx 30 minutes every time ) . 
  today 's was a bit less serious cause it 's cameron 's final pmq . 
   that america follows suit and impeaches bush so they can keep each other company . 
  then the whole gang can be turned over to the hague to be tried for war crimes .
