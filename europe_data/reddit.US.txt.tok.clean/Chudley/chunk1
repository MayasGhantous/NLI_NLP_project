sweet , looks like we both agree that the system we have now is aimed towards meeting those ends . 
   my thinking , and i 'm sure other americans , are that people should n't go hungry and without shelter ( both of which are provided ), 
  i read it as `` should people be free to do literally whatever they want , and explore their laziness or artistic endeavors and ** be supported by the rest of society ** that works '' or `` should people ** be able to work hard ** so that they can then be lazy and free to do literally whatever they want '' i agree that some lazy jerk should n't be propped up by society , and that he/she should work before he relaxes . 
  ( i should also add , that there are a lot of items that are provided while on welfare , that makes it comfortable to stay there ... such as air conditioning . 
  my thinking , and i 'm sure other americans , are that people should n't go hungry and without shelter ( both of which are provided ) but it should n't be comfortable , they should need to get out of welfare . 
  what was he going to do once he landed ? 
  there are workers everywhere in major airport hubs . 
  a weird looking , confused , scared outsider , without safety clothes/uniform would look quite out of place out on the tarmac . 
  i 'm pretty confident that if this were happening frequently , and there were successful landings , that any person hiding would be quickly found . 
  i read ` could of ' in my head as ` couldave ' ( my accent ) which to me automatically translates to ` could have ' . 
  i like reading these questions ; it makes me consider parts the english language that i take for granted ( words that sound the same ( or very similar ) but are different ) . 
  thank you for blowing my mind, 
   that and the price of an er visits in the us are infamous ... because of the uninsured who do n't pay for their treatment , now everyone else picks up their bill . 
  if you have insurance you 're not seeing the high fees unless you see the report from the insurance company saying you saved 4k by having insurance . 
  but , that 's neither here-nor-there though ; just to show that if people do n't see the actual costs they do n't see a problem . 
   i do n't think the argument of `` it 's a scammable and therefore flawed system '' that was n't the argument . 
  the argument was : ` how do we all not get screwed over by everyone who did n't contribute - why are we paying for deadbeats who did n't work hard enough to get insurance in the first place ' . 
  i ** have ** to state again , that this is n't my opinion , and only what i believe to be the argument against the nationalized/socialized healthcare system, 
  if asking me personally ( who wanted the healthcare to change to a national system ) i think it only bolstered our case to see healthcare change . 
  on a national scale , based upon who i talked to , i do n't know know if it changed people 's opinions . 
  surely everyone who was unemployed my age ( few years out of college ) saw the need for change , but everyone that graduated with me ( was republican ) and had a nice job did n't challenge their views just because of others who were now unemployed . 
  i never did understand why they thought that way though . 
  maybe it 's because the group of friends i have is young , and therefore do n't use as much healthcare . 
  everyone i asked who was older seemed to understand that it was an issue , but most already saw that the system needed change to begin with ( aka democrats ) . 
  i live in a liberal state , so more people are open minded to the canadian & european styles of hc . 
  i have no idea what the individual people of the south thought . . 
  i do n't agree that people think that a system is scammable because it 's state based . 
  all systems are on some level scammable so long as you understand how it functions . 
  the military is a no-bullshit organization that does n't run on emotions . 
  politics is 100 % emotion and therefore more pregnable ( sp ? ), 
  to corruption . 
  but that 's neither here nor there, 
  i meant the abstract social system is being scammed ; the idea that if you work hard you 'll have more and better than the guy who did n't work hard . 
  the idea is that those who did n't work hard do n't deserve healthcare because they did n't plan for it and probably bought frivolous items instead . 
  lets say i 'm a hardworking fella ' that has healthcare but did n't go on vacation and do n't have a lot of ` toys ' , because the system is set up either i have toys or i have healthcare . 
  now if joe-schmoe goes off and buys ps3 's , atv 's then goes on vacations a few times a year and pays for it with the money joe could have spent on healthcare , then ya , i 'd be a bit pissed that he 's scamming ` the system ' now that he receives all the benefits i paid for . 
  insurance is a gamble that takes care of you in the end ; but you can screw everyone over if you do n't pay when you 're young then take out more than you put in when you 're old . 
  in this way , joe-schmoe is screwing me over because i kept investing into the insurance system when i was young and now both of us ** share ** the money ** i ** was putting into insurance . 
  i 'm against the mandate to buy healthcare ; i think that 's a stupid idea and is truly unamerican ( american being you 're free to get what you want and nothing is forced upon you with the exception of taxes ) . 
  if , the plan was so that everyone has coverage and it comes out in the form of a tax , then i would feel much easier . 
  republicans do n't like the word ` new tax ', 
  i dont follow . . 
  the aversion comes from the belief that people will scam the system . 
  when hardworking people who worked their entire lives just to be covered , now have to cover the slackers who did n't work hard to get coverage . 
  to the people against , it 's an issue about social justice . 
  to the people for , it 's about raising the quality of life . 
  i 'm just playing devils advocate ; personally i think that pettiness like this needs to be left behind . 
  although the two parties are the same now , it has n't always been that way , and undoubtedly they 'll probably change a lot in the future . 
  right now they 're both different degrees of pro-business ; but who knows what 's in the future . 
  the republican party were once the progressives and have changed drastically . 
  just because there 's a 2 party system it does n't necessarily mean that they need to be different magnitudes of the same message . 
  just putting it out there ; the alternative vote is an awesome idea . 
  yea ... we all should have googled a bit before writing ( especially me ) [ http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/415/states-income-inequality.html#here] ( http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/415/states-income-inequality.html#here ) [ http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/25/news/economy/income_gap/] ( http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/25/news/economy/income_gap/ ) the two links contradict a bit ( just checking new york pbs says # 1 income inequality ; cnn says it 's # 3 -    but cnn is dated in 2006 ; and pbs is from april 2008 a lot can happen over a few years i suppose, 
  i doubt you 'll find those graphs for individual us states ; but you can find it on wikipedia for a list of countries income inequality, 
  i think that the reason we americans do n't have a great understanding about world geography is that we 're incredibly proud to be americans and anything foreign is either a novelty ( ikea ) or a bad thing ( chinese merchandise ) . 
  we always want to be bigger and better than everyone else and because of our size and economy we 're allowed to do that . 
  we * were * the first for a lot of very progressive ideas : women voting , industry , etc. . and we were afforded a lot because after world war ii we did n't have any competition and had many factories . 
  now the world has changed and a lot of the things that made america great either are old or simply not possible any more and the biggest generation ( the baby boomers ) are stuck in their old ways . 
  when you look at the world today , with the glasses of the 1950 & 60 's , then you see the mistakes that it seems you 're angry at . 
  another reason is in our culture it 's work work work work work work work ; and it 's been this way since the early puritans that first came to this country . 
  it 's a society that says you only get what you earn ; and this is a double edged sword . 
  you 'll get people working very hard , but also those who do n't know how to work hard will get left behind . 
  also , with our work work work mentality we do n't often have time to travel , and taking too many days off in a row ( even if sick ) is frowned upon . 
  i have n't really understood why this is yet , but it certainly does affect us a society . 
  now , as we do n't have a lot of time to travel we only see the united states ( also it 's all english ) and thus only care about where they 're traveling to . 
  another point is that if it 's 8hrs of travel to go anywhere of importance outside the united states then people are n't going to be wanting to waste 2 of their vacation days just in the air . 
  all this are excuses . 
  we as americans should know more about geography , but if people are n't pushed to learn more and actively punished with the time in the air to get anywhere , then they 're just not going to want to travel . 
  knowing the capital of cyprus does n't matter in world affairs . 
  knowing where in the world iraq is ; yea , that 's an important fact that americans should know . 
  ( and i wont get into that ) it 's a stretch to call out americans , and my voting record ( wtf was that ) when cnn fucks up a map though . 
  also , i have nothin ' against your country ; for all i hear it 's actually quite smart and dedicated towards improvement . 
  it seems like you have a lot of aggression towards america that i 'm not going to touch on . 
  just remember ; nato went into both afghanstan and iraq . 
  honestly , no matter what i say i 'm not going to change your view on me nor my country so i 'll leave with saying that we do a whole heck of a lot of good with a lot of aid and a lot of charity . 
  whenever there 's a natural disaster you bet your ass my country will be there en force with supplies . 
  if you do , do a rebuttal ; please tell me where you 're from so i can harshly judge your country and people as you do to mine, 
  ok , first , i do n't care about cyprus . 
  it does n't take a second of thought in my day . 
  if i were to think about cyprus once a decade then that 's a pretty eventful decade for cyprus in my book . 
  i was n't trying to be a dick to cyprus , but prove a point . 
  second , do n't infer who i vote for . 
  third , i do n't go to war . 
  rich powerful white men go to war and drag everyone else in with them . 
  my point was that as far as important countries in europe ; cyprus certainly is n't one of them ( and that 's fine , there 's nothing wrong with being in a small country ) . 
  my offence stems from the misleading title of ` americans ' instead of ` cnn ' . 
  i do n't know what the capital of your country is , but you probably do n't know what the capital of my state is ( and that 's fine too , it 's not important to know , or remember what a capital city is if it 's not a major player in world affairs ) . 
  also , i draw the parallel to your country to new york state because new york state is bigger economically and geographically and / should / be considered higher in importance than cyprus ( n.y.s. 
  gdp = $ 1,156,500,000,000 cyprus = $ 23,190,000,000 ; cyprus gdp is roughly 2 % of new york state ) ( n.y.s. 
  area 141,300 km2 ; cyprus area 9,251 km2 ; about 6.5 % of new york state ) . 
  now , all of this i do n't really care about ; borders are pretty much pointless . 
  but americans were called out for not knowing what the capital of cyprus is , and i argue that most europeans could n't name new york 's capital city . 
  to re-re-iterate , my argument is n't against you , i 'm sorry for the blunt , arrogant offense towards cyprus . 
  the misleading title enraged me and i needed to draw a strong parallel . 
  i just did and got 21 with about 12 correct capitals . 
  ( more i know , but ca n't think of them off the top of my head ) once i looked at wikipedia i could certainly place the rest on the map ; but i would n't remember off the top of my head . 
  ( most that i missed i 'm kicking myself for . 
  like : bosnia , crotia , greece , macedonia , lichtenstein , luxemburg , malta , netherlands , vatican city , ukrane ) . 
  most of the eastern countries i could n't name, 
  i 've been making this point a few times on here ( i 've been blasted quite harshly today with many downvotes ) that the u.s. states are the same size and/or economically similar to the european countries .
