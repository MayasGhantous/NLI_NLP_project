  the reticence to allow wives/sisters/daughters to work and integrate is very troubling and bodes poorly for the future . 
  because that is the key : immigrants working to build a new life in a new land . 
  that 's everything . 
  cultural immersion , sacrifice , and hard work make you a citizen . 
  welfare , obstinacy , and isolation make you a malcontent . 
  i fear europe is building up a huge sub-population of malcontents . 
  and muslim malcontents have n't had a very good track record , anywhere . 
  about language : i have a good friend in vienna ( i love that city and have visited many times ) . 
  years ago , he told me a story about the integration of muslims in vienna : there was a political move by center-right politicians in austria to force immigrants to learn german . 
  this was vehemently opposed by the left , who viewed the measure as nationalist chauvinism and forced `` germanfication '' . 
  they won . 
  immigrants were no longer forced by law to learn german . 
  then , something wonderful happened . 
  muslim women ( wives and mothers mostly ) marched in the streets on vienna , calling on the government to force them to learn german . 
  why ? 
  because their husbands and family members often forced the women to stay in the shadows , to avoid meaningful work , and remain unseen . 
  but these women wanted jobs . 
  they wanted to break away from that cultural patriarchy . 
  they wanted to get divorces and raise their kids and get jobs and be functioning members of viennese society . 
  i 'm not sure how it all turned out ( this was about 10 years ago ; i 'd welcome any comments or updates from austrians ) , but i think it shows there is a need to instruct all the new immigrants in the local language . 
  classes should be free of charge , available to all , and thorough . 
  mainstream an immigrant and you get a citizen . 
  ostracize an immigrant and you get a malcontent . 
  i was intimidated at first , but then i discovered that amsterdamers cycle like new jerseyites drive : fast , aggressive , and with an emphasis on keeping traffic moving . 
  once i got `` into the flow '' and kept pedaling rather than gliding , i joined `` the pack '' and got around quite well . 
  as an american tourist who spent a week in amsterdam last year , i was able to avoid walking in the bike lane by ... renting a bike . 
  i got around much better , saw more of the city , and did n't clog up traffic . 
  i have no idea why tourists would want to walk . 
  thanks for the sentiment , but we do n't have a revenue problem or a money problem . 
  we have a political will problem . 
  we are far and away the wealthiest nation on earth . 
  our gdp is $ 17t , second only to the combined eu . 
  and i would wager that if you added in the value of resources and private property , the usa is stupefyingly wealthy and valuable . 
  it ai n't the money . 
  we just have a culture of whining about taxes . 
  we founded our nation on whining about taxes and we 've whined about taxes ever since . 
  we proudly cough up for the military , the roads , and moon landings because they are vivid , concrete measures of our investment . 
  once the investment becomes abstract ( education , health , welfare , art , research ) we immediately start whining . 
  it 's in our nature . 
  we appreciate your offer , but it would be refused . 
  we need to spend some more time in the weeds before we come around . 
  that 's another aspect of our culture . 
  oh , and fried foods . 
  we really like fried foods . 
  and pick up trucks . 
  and action films . 
  and bbq . 
  we 're really good at bbq . 
  here in merka , we have ** 41 million ** immigrants . 
  about ** 14 million ** of them are here illegally . 
  so , in the words of that sage statesman bruce willis : `` welcome to the party , pal ! '', 
  note : i do n't mind immigrants . 
  the vast majority are hard-working law-abiding folks . 
  the arab-american community is one of the most law-abiding and family-centric groups . 
  and the mexicans ? 
  in my mind they 're as american as apple pie , albeit with a tortilla crust . 
  even that would be helpful . 
  `` a swiss person was seen gunning down people in the city center . 
  citizens are asked to be on the lookout for a tall , blond man with yellow britches , a striking red vest with embroidery , a black mid-brim hat with flowers on it , and a cheroot in his mouth . 
  the suspect is armed and dangerous and may be carrying a toblerone and yodeling at passersby . '', 
  i have yet to visit turkey or greece . 
  turkey is high on my list . 
  i have created itineraries and browsed hotels . 
  i want to see istanbul , fly to izmir , drive the south coast , see cappadocia , etc. 
  but i have concerns lately . 
  walking around with an american passport is n't always a good thing . 
  our state department warnings are often overblown but their overall concerns are genuine . 
  americans are the # 1 value target for islamist lunatics ( behind israelis , i would think ) . 
  i would n't go anywhere near se turkey . 
  but even five days in cappadocia gives me concern . 
  it would be a perfect terror target . 
  assault a hotel , shoot down tourist balloons , etc. 
  i realize the actual numerical likelihood of getting killed in turkey is low , but i think i 'll wait until there is some stability in syria before i go venturing in that area . 
  instead , i 'm looking closer at greece , thus fulfilling the premise of op 's news story . 
  a few days in athens to overcome jet lag and see old things would be nice , followed by crete , delphi , and the greek islands . 
  i know greece could really use my tourist dollars . 
  all things considered , my next projected trip ( should i decide on that region ) would be greece . 
  i 'll wait on turkey . 
  it happens in the us , too . 
  `` in breaking news : a human has allegedly gunned down five people in the city center . 
  this human is considered to be armed and dangerous . 
  police are investigating and looking for any leads to identify and locate this human . 
  citizens are urged to be on the lookout for a human who is armed and killing people . 
  residents are being asked to stay indoors but remain vigilant until this human is caught . '', 
  the donbass rebels had a huge yard sale . 
  they unloaded a lot of old mattresses and samovars to local babushkas . 
  with this revenue they were able to purchase these tanks from the russian government . 
  so it 's all legal and there is no direct russian influence in the region . 
  reminds me of the infamous [ cleveland tourism video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysmla5tqbiy ) . 
  how dare you question official verified american intelligence !, 
  enjoy your 10 year stay on the global no-fly list , ya commie !, 
  we americans have always been interested in the ethnic source of [ belschnickel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnu2orf-gjw ) . 
  seems to me the un is organized enough to have some minimal standards for their interns . 
  no need to pay them a luxurious salary . 
  but they could lease an apartment block commensurate with their known intern population and offer free dorm-style rooms . 
  tack on a small salary for food and the occasional beer . 
  then ask switzerland to provide health care . 
  it would be a tough six months , but it would `` level the playing field '' for interns , open it up to anyone who could afford the travel costs , and create a sense of shared camaraderie among the intern staff . 
  toss in some packages from home and it might even be downright livable . 
  two can play at this game !,
