  this will turn the tide towards peace . 
  it 's not so much that we want to win , but that we want to see other countries lose at their own game too . 
  this one i really do n't understand , but i 'm more talking about spice blends in general . 
   ingredients : paprika , salt , celery seed , sugar , dehydrated garlic , black pepper , dehydrated onion , green onion , dill seed , fenugreek , caraway , turmeric , dillweed , bay , cumin , coriander , ginger , cinnamon , fennel , nutmeg , white pepper [ 1 ] ( http://www.urbanaccents.com/spice-blends-hungarian-herb-paprika-blend-p/1508.htm ) it 's a pre-made blend of spices with a paprika base , which is why it says `` blend '' on it . 
  maybe you do n't have pre-made blended spices in europe , but it 's pretty common to have stuff like this in stores for people who want a specific flavor but ca n't get the ratios right or do n't want to buy 20 different kinds of spices . 
  like if you were a pirate or a sea captain and sailed the oceans of the world it 'd be pretty important . 
  and yet , people still drink j\u00e4germeister .

  he got shot before a speech and kept giving the speech . 
  let alone what he did at san juan hill and the rest of the wars where they were actually fighting , not just putting on some gloves and dancing around in a ring . 
  damn , that 's some good shit , dog . 
  this just seems wrong . 
  if you rape a statue you should probably go to jail . 
  it 's an english phrase that means to purposely divert attention from what would otherwise be of greater importance , to something else of lesser significance .

  it seems to be several related small groups of orthodox protestants . 
  they tend to be members of the [ reformed political party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reformed_political_party ) ( sgp ) . 
  [ look at this map of their where they recieved significant amount of votes . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/sgp-stemmers_per_gemeente_tweede_kamer_2003.png ) it 's pretty much the same as the maps linked . 
   despite high vaccination coverage , there have recently been measles , mumps , and rubella epidemics largely confined to an orthodox protestant minority that objects to vaccination in the netherlands . 
  [ 1-3 ] this orthodox protestant minority consists of about 250,000 individuals representing a number of denominations that separated from the dutch reformed church . 
  do n't forget the italian scientists who were guilty of earthquaking . 
  arthur seems like a good choice .

  we pretty much started this party by dominating the internet in number of users early on . 
  it 's only recently that that has shifted . 
  here 's a interesting chart : http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/worldwide-internet-users_50c1f5f869b1d.png,

  i think an important thing to note is this is * municipal * solid waste . 
  so , the trash that 's picked up by city services . 
  while norway is high , they also lead using trash to generate energy , so it 's not really a bad thing for them . 
  it does n't mean they produce more trash , they just collect more . 
  the opposite might be true of croatia , where they produce as much trash , they just do n't do a good job of collecting it . 
  if your opinion is against the reddit status quo , then stating it is just an invitation to be flamed . 
  there are certain topics where no meaningful discussion can take place . 
  this is just off the top of my head , so if i 'm wrong , sorry . 
  it 's an small island in the mediterranean , pretty close to africa and specifically libya . 
  it 's a catholic country that in its history was the where the knight templar or some order of knights derived from that order wound up settling . 
  i assume they have falcons because of the maltese falcon .

  we must find some whales for turkey . 
  not just people either . 
  we 're related to ( probably ) all life on earth . 
  some of my relatives lived across the river in ohio and the hillbillies can be pretty awesome when you get to know them . 
  my brother said he 's had some of the best liquor ever in the form of moonshine and they grow some great stuff to smoke up in the hills . 
  he also said they 'd tell him stories about the people who lived way up in the mountains that were so inbred that their skin has started to turn translucent . 
  i do n't know how much is legend and how much is fact , but he was told to stay away from the ones who live way up there . 
  they also all believe in the mothman around those parts . 
  it is really beautiful from a scenic standpoint in that it has lots of mountains and untouched valleys with beautiful rivers flowing through them . 
  it 's a nice place to drive through , but it 's the people that live there that give it a reputation . 
  this is the region that really defines the term `` hillbilly '' . 
  the monks did n't mind , it was the criminals before jabba that did not leave politely .

  kangaroos are marsupials , not mammals . 
  why ? 
  i think it 's hilarious the guy that wants to eat all the animals is from hungary . 
  enjoy !, 
  the gamey taste comes from the wild diet and increased exercise . 
  so it 's more about how the animals are raised . 
  i 've had bison and it tastes a lot like beef . 
  it 's just much leaner . 
  back in the 80s or 90s there was a kangaroo scandal here just like the horse one going on now . 
  they found ranchers were using ` roo meat to supplement their beef . 
  i 've heard kangaroo is really good from people who 've traveled to australia . 
  i 'm questioning your word choice . 
  i do n't think `` hole '' is what you were going for there . 
  bison is the direction we 're already headed in for those who want a healthy alternative to beef . 
  i think kangaroo could catch on too . 
  i 'd like to see a mcponyburger though . 
  i think , at least the issue with horses ( not bugs ) is that it is morally wrong . 
  for many people horses are our friends and you do n't eat your friends . 
  sort of the same reason we do n't eat cats , dogs , or other people . 
  it just seems wrong . 
  they are our friends and should be treated with respect . 
  it might not be entirely logical , but is is a valid emotional and moral issue . 
  locusts , caterpillars , crickets , moth larvae , and termites to name a few . 
  there are species of bugs that are healthier , less expensive , and have less enviromental impact . 
  do you eat those ? 
  i do n't see a hole . 
  are you sure `` hole '' is the word you want to use ? 
  what hole ?

  not really .
