  say you hit the ball and it hits the ground before a defensive player catches it . 
  your man on first or second can advance immediately without having to `` tag up '' . 
  say there 's a runner on first and second , there are no outs and the batter hits the ball on the ground . 
  in this scenario the runners on first and second * must * advance to the next base to make room for the batter advancing to first . 
  if the defense can field the ball and a defensive player touches third base with possession of the ball before the runner gets there that runner is `` forced out '' . 
  depending on the situation this can lead to what are called `` double '' or `` triple '' plays where two or even all three outs of the inning occur in a single play . 
  [ example of a triple play ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rivv2ecp7l4 ) now , any baserunner ( player who is `` on base '' ) can `` steal '' the next base before , during or after the pitch ( assuming the batter does not hit the ball ) and will be safe at the next base . 
  you most commonly see a man steal second base just as the pitch as thrown because it 's the longest throw from home plate where the catcher is . 
  but you can steal any base other than third . 
  once a player advances from third to home without being tagged out that 's one point for his team . 
  if a player hits a ball out of the field but within the `` v '' shape of the field ( marked by the `` foul lines '' ) it 's a `` home run '' and he automatically scores along with any of his teammates that were already on base . 
  if the bases are `` loaded '' , that is to say first , second and third base all have a runner , that 's four points and a huge swing in the game referred to as a `` grand slam '' . 
  if the home team is ahead when the visiting team gets their third out in the `` top of the ninth inning '' the `` bottom of the ninth '' wo n't be played and the home team wins . 
  if the teams are tied after nine innings the game goes into extra innings until one team finishes an inning ahead and wins . 
  the longest game in major league baseball history was 33 innings lasting 8 hours and 25 minutes on may 8th , 1984 between the chicago white sox and the milwaukee brewers . 
  each team plays 162 games in a season , sometimes more than one a day ( called a `` doubleheader '' ) . 
  the mlb ( major league baseball ) has 30 teams and is divided into two `` leagues '' ( the american league or al and the national league or nl ) . 
  in the national league pitchers must bat whereas in the american league his spot can be taken by a `` designated hitter '' whose entire job is to bat . 
  each league is divided into three `` divisions '' with 5 teams each . 
  every year four teams from each league advance to the postseason playoffs where an eventual champion is determined in the world series . 
  the most infamous of which is the 1919 `` black sox scandal '' where members of the chicago white sox coordinated with members of the american mafia to fix the championship and intentionally lost . 
  resulted in a grand jury and criminal trial and 8 members of the white sox ( who would n't win another championship for over 85 years ) were banned from baseball for life including the illiterate shoeless joe jackson ( considered one of the greatest ever players ) who actually had no involvement . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_sox_scandal probably not a very good eli5 due to the length but there you go . 
  i 'm sure i 'm forgetting stuff as well . 
  ask away if you have questions . 
  someone has to fight the war they 're fleeing from . 
  and my point is that if they 're admitting their original * estimate * was off by such a magnitude why should anyone trust their new estimate will be accurate ? 
  how do they know it 's going to cap off at 30k ? 
  i do n't know if swedes use a different calendar than us but there 's still 2.3 months left in 2015 . 
  they already admitted their initial estimate was 2.5 times less than what they 're saying now . 
  very well said and i wholeheartedly agree . 
  it 's victim blaming . 
  may as well say women deserve to get raped for wearing short skirts which is particularly ironic considering who it is that 's usually pushing this viewpoint . 
  people in western countries have lived in a bubble for decades and think that their institutions , governments , countries , etc. 
  are set in stone and take them for granted . 
  it 's pretty naive and arrogant . 
  and how many british children could be fed , clothed , schooled , etc. 
  for that money ? 
  people love to spend money that is n't theirs . 
  but then leftist politicians do n't gain from demographic shifts in which they gain whole new voting blocs that will continue to put them in power and `` leave the door open '' . 
  plenty of these people are not going to ever leave . 
  just like democrats with hispanic immigration in the us . 
  organized crime is having a field day at the moment . 
  going to be interesting to see what they do with the huge amounts of capital they 're making off this in the coming years . 
  too much thoughtcrime . 
  and to think i used to want to visit sweden one day ... 
  by that logic why not just start shelling out 23k `` tax refunds '' to british citizens ? 
   eu elites are giving away the farm not * their * farm . 
  the elites do nothing but benefit from a fragmented and infighting working class and a shock increase to the labor pool/market . 
  it 's not university professors , politicians and bankers that are worried about their jobs being taken by an immigrant . 
  when you 're at a point where enforcing your international borders and enforcing international law ( such as registering and containing refugees in the first safe country of arrival ) is `` fascist '' you know something is very , very wrong . 
  the political and economic elites always benefit from a fragmented working class population and shock increases to the labor pool .

  that was less than a minute of googling and those are all from the last year or two . . 
  and wages have stagnated since the 1960s when we basically `` opened the door '' . 
  these are n't mutually exclusive . 
  so fuck the native working class basically ? 
  shock devaluation of labor market sure as shit is n't `` really good '' for them . 
  are they really an `` anti-immigration '' party or is that just one of their stances and they 're the only ones with the balls to actually do something ? 
  and the federal government sent in troops to forcibly integrate against public opinion . 
  when it 's somebody talking from personal experience that did n't have a pleasant one you lot start yelling about anecdotes . 
  at least i have a flair for people to make assumptions and insults about me for my nationality you fucking coward . 
  the `` white savior '' complex is real . 
  it only hurts everyone involved . 
  so what you 're saying is we should go back to the old ways of settling things by brute force and strength of arms . 
  so we should start machine gunning down every man , woman and child that tries to cross our border illegally . 
  that 's what you 're saying right ? 
  you can still play with us , we still < 3 you guys . 
  but we 're not going to call it football . 
  it was pretty naive and stupid of them to think they could force eastern european countries as well . 
  all they have to do is let the germans blink first , which they will because they 're the ones being swamped by hundreds of thousands . 
  a lot of people seem to think that you can just flip a `` war '' switch and start pumping out tanks , bombs and soldiers overnight . 
  it takes years to do a lot of these things in quantity needed for actual conflict and you can give soldiers the best equipment and weapons in the world but if they 've had very little experience with them , especially combat experience , they can run into trouble from shepherds with rusty aks who have spent their entire lives fighting . 
   i agree , that 's more than sufficient and better than whatever europe has to offer . 
  you know there 's plenty of americans that have just that exact attitude towards 90 % of the european nato members right ? 
  because 50 + angry men violating the borders of bulgaria were advancing on border guards outnumbered nearly 20-1 . 
  so they did their jobs and duty . 
  and we have plenty of laws both federally and at the state level . 
  people that think it 's still the wild west in regards to owning or purchasing a firearm are just flat out ignorant, 
  and that 's a societal price plenty of us are willing to pay in exchange for our individual rights . 
  it 's just frustrating when these hardcore anti-rights types get so worked up they ca n't accept anything other than full bans on something they do n't understand or have any experience with . 
  `` better judged by 12 than carried by 6 '' . 
   guns are not useful against surprise knife assaults . 
  blatantly false . 
  i take it you did n't see the video of the palestinian who surprise attacked israeli soldiers with a knife from one foot away and still got lit the fuck up . 
  if someone comes at you with a knife while you 're off guard from within 21 feet you 're going to get stabbed . 
  that 's going to happen . 
  i 'd rather get stabbed once or twice and then be able to shoot my attacker than get butchered . 
  slovenia does n't have a military sworn to defend slovenia and the slovenian people ? 
  that 's kind of the entire purpose of a military . 
  to defend the nation and people . 
  this is pure social darwinism . 
   and the value of the house increases who says it 's going to do that ? 
  in my area property values still have n't gotten back to where they were pre-2008 . 
  october 16th , 2025 we 'll see . 
  the majority will most likely never return . 
  germany will now always have a sizeable minority of syrians and all the people who claim they are . 
  there 's no going back at this point . 
  especially once they 're handed citizenship which they will be . 
  having thousands if not tens of thousands of raving violent lunatic murderers , rapists and other literal human filth is a far bigger societal problem .
