  i never said we should abandon anybody . 
  i said we do n't need to lead from the front . 
  and russian aggression in continental europe is because of your weakness . 
  maybe if we 'd gotten more help we could have better policed the place and w would n't have had so much leeway to fuck shit up . 
  both of these situations were avoidable . 
  but that was the past and this is now . 
  eu needs the us a hell of a lot more than the us needs the eu , especially looking at a fucking war with russia which is a hell of a lot different than a war in the middle east which europe has done without the help of the us just fine for centuries . 
  and then we get accused of `` muh cia coups '' . 
  we were n't sitting like ducks between europe and the nazis in ww2 and we came out alright . 
  there 's no reason to think we could n't support our interests and potentially even help them fight a war without leading the charge . 
  it 's not our weakness that 's emboldening putin . 
  one could even argue allowing europe to be given a reality check would be beneficial to us long-term interests in getting european nations to invest in their military infrastructures and personnel . 
  cool . 
  i 'm not denying that . 
  but like i said we should send to our so called allies exactly what they sent us when we called on them . 
  not a soldier ( the majority of which absolutely need to be away from the hot areas and combat like most of our `` coalition allies '' did in iraq/afghanistan ) , boot , bullet or cent more . 
  and we should do just as much time-wasting , bitching and moaning as we got before we do it as well . 
  but why are you even worried ? 
  surely your `` european brothers '' would n't leave you to fend for yourselves in the face of a full scale russian invasion ? 
  not with how much they love to jack off about the `` eu army '' . 
  who could even think of facing down such a magnificent and powerful force ? 
  not the russians . 
  or so / r/europe tells me . 
  you would n't even need us support . 
  we should do a token job like what we got from our nato allies in iraq and afghanistan . 
  send each a couple hundred or thousand and call it a day . 
  limited combat and front line postings to be sure . 
  we were n't the ones who invited aggression through decades of gluttony and weakness . 
  but i would rather defend ee than anywhere to the west besides uk and denmark . 
  it 's not our fault that when we 've told europe for years to invest in their military forces they spat in our face and called us baby killing warmongers . 
  there is no `` post-eu '' that should concern us . 
  eu wants to have us bankroll their expansion by betting american cash and blood . 
  fuck that . 
  we already get accused of trying to hurt the eus stability . 
  at least we provide protection . 
  what does the eu provide us that we did n't have before beyond holier than thou bullshit rhetoric ? 
  fuck the eu they want ukraine let them pay and bleed for it . 
  i mean all germanic languages are going to have some similarities . 
  how about a german or french base ? 
  how about some eu armed forces , that everyone here loves to circlejerk over , go dig in out there ? 
  why should we keep sending our boys to stand between the eu and russia like lambs to the slaughter just so we can be accused of warmongering and imperialism ? 
  eu wants to be a superpower so let them guard their own damn backyard . 
  damn straight . 
  at least you guys actually have a military worth a damn which puts you in the top 10 % of nato countries . 
  dd is n't even that good , so many better options . 
  you can disagree with merkel getting awarded it and also disagree with obama having been awarded it . 
  just got ta stop worrying and learn to love the bomb . 
  like it fucking matters . 
  literally everything is fully our fault . 
  the 6.7 billion other people on this damn rock have no fucking free will or agency apparently . 
  if they started doing that here to house illegals people would be getting fucking shot . 
  personally that would be the final straw for me and i would join one of the local militias . 
  `` this video is blocked in your country '' that does n't happen often . 
  i do n't know i 'll let you know after the super top secret american meeting . 
  maybe they 're worried the germans will give syria to russia for some cheap gas ? 
  mhmm which is why we spent 50 years with our tanks standing between west europe and the ussr . 
  also why we 've been practically begging our nato `` allies '' to get their heads out of their asses and invest in their armed forces the past 15 years . 
  all part of the long con to destabilize the countries we 're sworn to defend and are our biggest economic partners ... 
  sometimes the lengths europeans will go to in order to avoid responsibility for themselves is astounding . 
  but at the end of the day if all you can see yourself as is a puppet of bigger countries that 's all you 'll ever be and have nobody to blame but yourselves . 
  that 's funny because my `` gun culture '' was growing up knowing to respect and how to handle and care for firearms from the age of four . 
  idiots not being able to handle themselves does n't mean my rights should be violated . 
  you can get .17 & .22 revolvers as well . 
  `` revolver '' simply describes the mechanical action of the firearm . 
  it 's meaningless in terms of round size . 
  if food , water and shelter was all that was being asked and given the right to self-determination would never be under threat in the first place . 
  i once still had respect for the republican party . 
  imagine what an ass i feel like . 
  who is currently polling as the leading republican candidate by far . 
  2nd declaration from `` the universal declaration of human rights '' :  2 . 
  ** all ** peoples have the right to ** self-determination ** ; by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic , ** social and cultural development ** . 
  why does this apparently * universal * declaration of rights apply to some people more than others ? 
  there 's a difference between military regulation and law . 
  only idiots think there are n't exceptions . 
  crusaders controlled the holy land at times as well . 
  does that mean they still have rights to it ? 
  do the brits get to start claiming the old empire again ? 
  the french ? 
  at the end of the day people have a right to decide the future of their nation and ethnicity . 
   i 'm sick of this weaksauce ancestral homogeneity argument around a concept that has never fucking existed . 
  for who ? 
  not the japanese or syrians or plenty of other non-white majority countries right ? 
  the ones that are do not have the right to remain as such if that 's what the people of those countries decide ? 
  that is to say , they should not have the human right of self-determination ? 
  us is n't the ancestral homeland of various white ethnicities or nations . 
  white people have a right to the nations of their ancestors . 
  nobody questions this of anybody else in the world . 
  why are traditionally white countries the only ones supposedly obligated to destroy their homogeneity ? 
  fair enough but they do the exact same thing in regards to americans and us being flooded by mexico and central/south america .

  right ? 
  fucking decades of their holier than thou `` moral superiority '' complex and then that 's all thrown out the window in less than a year of `` crisis '' . 
  popcorn tastes good watching this shitshow . 
  pretty sure american leftists have been saying that 's almost exactly what we should do ... 
  an over saturated labor market does nothing but benefit big business and the wealthy . 
  are you honestly comparing processing and registering people in an orderly fashion and enforcing international borders with jim crow , slavery and reservations ? 
  you 're right , the animal should n't suffer . 
  but all things considered is it really any worse than being eaten alive ? 
  they are an invasive species and they 're absolutely destroying our native ecosystems . 
  iirc it 's actually against the law in some states and counties to not kill them if caught .
