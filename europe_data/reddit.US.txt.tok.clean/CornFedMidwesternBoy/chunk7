  our prison system needs reform to be sure but to pretend like our violence and gang problems are even close to the same level of magnitude or scale as theirs is just disingenuous . 
  i 'm pretty confident that if we did a max security `` prisoner swap '' type deal our inmates would tear their prisons and guards to shreds . 
  i mean shit we have 1.4 ** million ** gang members in the us . 
  the prison mentality and culture and scale are just very different . 
  it 's going to take decades to reform and it 's not just the prison system that needs that reform but our law enforcement and aspects of our own culture as well . 
  okay . 
  and ? 
  that does n't change the fact that i do n't want to die because of some assholes in washington . 
  yeah that was fun but at least out of some 17 candidates not all of them came across as raving lunatics . 
  so we got that going for us which is nice . 
  if we have clinton v. bush ( trump ) 2016 i 'm ragequiting voting . 
  this country is pretty crazy right now :(, 
  which go back much further than us involvement in the middle east . 
  maybe i am crazy ? 
  usually you get `` jumped in '' . 
  that is beaten by other gang members for a certain length of time to prove loyalty to the gang . 
  could be couple seconds could be over a minute or two . 
  some of the more hardcore prison gangs require you to spill blood for the gang . 
  most have a `` blood in blood out '' rule , as in the only way to leave the gang is death . 
  as far as how do authorities know who is banging ? 
  usually they 're proud and admit it . 
  otherwise through `` flying colors '' , throwing out gang signs and gang/prison tattoos . 
  i do n't want to . 
  that 's a pretty good reason for me . 
  so because people in high places fucked up average working people should let themselves be slaughtered because of the passport they carry ? 
  is that what you 're suggesting ? 
  please . 
  more people get killed in most of our cities in a good weekend than most of your countries get in half a year . 
  there 's 1.4 ** million ** gang members in the us . 
  we have plenty of neo-nazis here as well . 
  also militant black supremacist groups we have mexican and central/south american cartels operating here . 
   how does being a terrorist justification for solitary confinement and a near complete ban on outside communication ? 
  how about the fact that plenty of these dudes have already murdered many people while already in prison . 
  they communicate to the outside and order hits and other shit on the streets . 
  if you want to help us with our problems do so in a constructive way . 
  not with this holier than thou bullshit that completely ignores some of the major issues . 
  what about the rights of lower security prisoners to not be murdered while serving their time or the right of corrections officers to not be murdered on the job ? 
  that 's the thing . 
  a lot of these people that are in these supermax facilities are in there because they quite literally ca n't be handled in gp . 
  we could go back to our old systems and prison layouts of large overcrowded cellblocks . 
  we 'd probably start seeing the murder and assault rates go through the roof inside . 
  more riots . 
  more dead correctional officers . 
  i 'm not saying everything that 's done to keep these people in custody and the rest of the prison population safe is exactly hunky dory . 
  i just think it 's important to remember exactly what kind of people we 're talking about dealing with here . 
  some of these guys have been in the prison system since they were kids . 
  they 're criminally insane and have nothing to do all day but work out and think about ways to escape or otherwise do things they are n't supposed to be doing . 
  many of these guys are gang members , that 's the reason their communications to the outside are so limited and monitored . 
  there are guys in prison who are still capable of leading their gangs on the street from inside and ordering murders and such while still behind bars . 
  most of them have killed people . 
  frankly most of them probably would have been put to death 20 years ago and that would be the end of it . 
  i 'm not saying things are perfect but this country moves slow sometimes and practically no politician is going to spend political capital on these issues so that their opponent can slam them for being `` soft on hardened criminals '' . 
  unfortunately it seems the way things change in the prison system here is when things get bad enough that prisoners riot and people get hurt and die . 
  koch brothers = / = the united states . 
  that 's really not fair at all . 
  here in the us we still fight about federal/state/local government and their roles every day and we 've been a union for 250 years and are a common people with a common language . 
  i honestly think many europeans are way too gung ho about federalization without understanding the consequences . 
  it 's all fun and games until it 's * your * city or neighborhood being forced to do something against its will by the powers that be . 
  it costing my whole paycheck is a pretty good reason not to do it . 
  get the fuck off our turf . 
  gon na take a wild guess here and assume that 0 % or close to it of these migrants hold a degree in economics . 
  so it 's not like he has to worry about * his * job . 
  maybe they should have thought of that before marching thousands of kilometers north . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_eyes too bad your government and intelligence services do . 
  and ours yours . 
  exactly , it not happening to american citizens or an american airliner is irrelevant , they can still study it to learn from it to try and prevent it in the future . 
  no different than military forces the world over sending observers to conflict zones to see the tactics and weapons and such that are being used and their effectiveness . 
  edit : and even if it was n't really a bomb but an accident or mechanical failure it would still want to be studied from an engineering and aviation standpoint . 
  why should they give anything to foreigners so long as there are children of their own country going hungry and their own countrymen living in poverty ? 
  why are foreigners who have never paid a cent in more entitled to taxpayer money than the people who provided it ? 
  i 'm not saying we should n't help them out but if anybody thinks american troops there will do anything other than escalate things is delusional . 
  what do you want us to do bomb moscow ? 
  any us military involvement would only escalate the situation and we would be widely accused of imperialism and playing `` world police '' . 
  we go in and it becomes a giant clusterfuck and we get all the blame . 
  well duh , you 're trying to inflict pain and suffering but to get them to talk . 
  if they 're dead they ca n't tell you shit . 
  that 's like a chihuahua barking while standing under the legs of a rottweiler . 
  what is n't simple about it ? 
  you restrain them and tell them that if they attempt to free themselves they 'll be met with force . 
  they 're not stupid or cattle . 
  here in the us we call that type `` limousine liberals '' . 
   it 's a win for everyone involved other than for the native unskilled labor market yeah , just tens of millions of people . 
  no biggie . 
  it 's absolutely * possible * . 
  legal ? 
  probably not , but neither is illegally crossing international borders . 
  possible ? 
  definitely . 
  extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures . 
  if they do n't have a passport or id there 's no paperwork anyway . 
  unless they 've already been somehow processed . 
  but i bet if you start telling people : `` you 're getting on this plane and leaving the country tonight no matter what . 
  so you can either tell us where you 're from and we 'll take you home , or we 'll drop you off in some random sub-saharan shithole and you can figure things out for yourself '' . 
  people may be inclined to tell you where they 're really from . 
  so business as usual ? 
  you 're telling me you ca n't get some rope and a large man with a weapon for less than 6000 ? 
  i never said we do it out of kindness . 
  nobody should have any access to nato resources unless they 're a member or are willing to pay well for them . 
  that 's only fair to the taxpayers keeping the whole thing afloat . 
  we 're in a position to use much more pressure than just asking them .
