  without us there is nothing , we can protect our interests in the region without nato or the cooperation of most european states in the first place . 
  but we would anyway because of the strategic value of sweden which the swedish government and people have known full well for decades . 
  ultimately i just do n't want american troops put in harms way to defend those who would n't defend us . 
  i do n't think that or caution in expanding nato is unreasonable . 
  and like i said , i do n't care if you do or do n't . 
  my point is it 's not really up to sweden if they join , it 's up to nato . 
  just like it 's not up to nato if sweden does * not * join , but up to sweden . 
  at the end of the day if you 're not going to bring a net benefit to nato we should n't let you in even if you want to be in . 
  if you 're not in it 's pretty irrelevant to nato unless war actually breaks out in scandinavia in which case you 'll probably see sweden 's sovereignty ignored anyway if they do n't want to cooperate ( assuming they 're not somehow fighting in the first place by themselves against an invader ) ala iceland in ww2 . 
  we should kick out all the slackers as well . 
  i do n't think they should be strongarmed into joining , i think they should n't join period if they do n't meet minimum standards . 
  every country that does n't meet their 2 % spending should be kicked out as well . 
  i see it as a burden to involve and provide another country with the benefits and resources of nato when they have no obligation to come to the defense of the rest of nato yes . 
  there should be no free riders in military alliances . 
  why is the us still stuck like a mother hen over europe ? 
  because of european inaction and disdain for maintaining hard power . 
  no other reasons . 
  european countries are sovereign . 
  neither the us nor russia has forced the overwhelming majority of european countries to ignore military spending . 
  in fact in the case of the us government they 've literally been begging you to increase spending and get met with being called warmongering , imperialist babykillers . 
  lol . 
  better negotiate with the terrorists eu . 
  because everybody knows you glorified bureaucrats would be able to do fuck all to stop them . 
  assuming they even wanted to stop this madness . 
  which they 've shown no sign of . 
  fuck that , i say make them pay through the teeth for anything and everything they want to take advantage of . 
  we owe them nothing and should charge for our services . 
  playing our old game together one more time ivan ? 
  well okay , but only if you agree to no face or nut shots . 
  i 've always loved the way he says `` sofort '' . 
  like all you had to do all these years was just ask ... 
  money is now protected `` speech '' and corporations are `` people '' . 
  what do you expect ? 
  the mere fact that he was standing on that stage during the first democratic debate and that because of his presence all the candidates were actually debating the merits of unfettered capitalism by itself is progress . 
  i had never before seen or heard that in an establishment political setting in my entire life . 
  shit if i were you i would leave now just to make the point . 
  there would never be any serious barriers this is all just hot air . 
  [ you can have our yards , acres , rods , furlongs , ounces , gallons and pints when you pry them from our cold dead hands you pinko commie bastards !, 
  well , they ca n't force people breaking international law and the integrity of the borders of the nation onto a plane against their will !, 
  that would be a gross violation of human rights !, 
  they ** can ** , however , force taxpayers to pick up the bills . 
  could there be a relation between them being expensive and fewer young people drinking ? 
  my dad tells me stories of how they used to have 25 cents beer nights . 
  2015 is over already ? 
  my calendar still shows 2 months left . 
  they 're squirrel refugees , plenty of people still eat them around here . 
  [ we were friends once ] ( http://imgur.com/65wi9sa ) . 
  the american and russian people are very similar . 
  our governments are different , but similar . 
  depends on your definition which varies . 
  most midwesterners just look at the region as a whole . 
  but those states also have a lot of land that 's prairie or farmland as well . 
  oh yes there is . 
  minnesota 's motto i think is still `` the land of 10,000 lakes '' . 
  minnesota , wisconsin , up are all very wooded and lakes , hell on lake superior i 've seen people drive trucks 20 + miles out onto the ice to fish . 
  no i understand perfectly that pro-immigration people tend to not give a fuck about the working class . 
  no we do n't compete . 
  we lose . 
  why hire a native when you can hire an illegal and pay him less than what 's illegal . 
  in longer hours and worse conditions than legal and have them deported if they get uppity or god forbid unionize . 
  they 'll just bus in a new load the next day . 
  it does nothing but hurt both working americans ** and ** mexicans . 
  it 's only `` populism '' when the right are doing the will of the people . 
  so they 're going to just accept that their relative standard of living is much lower than it was back home ? 
  that now instead of middle class they 're barely even `` working class '' with no marketable skills ? 
  they 're just going to be cool with all that ? 
  not get angry and resentful or turn to crime to continue having nice luxuries like iphones and designer jeans ? 
  if i were leaving my home to seek refuge in foreign lands i would never expect anything from the local population and would be incredibly grateful for anything they generously provided me . 
  i 'm assuming you 're not one of the hundreds of millions of working class americans that has seen their real wages walk off a cliff the past 40 years in large part thanks to our corporate conglomerates exploiting illegal labor and showing an utter disregard for us labor and immigration law . 
  he never said that , that 's what the msm wants you to think he said . 
  because god fucking forbid anybody challenge the big corporate conglomerates and their insatiable need for cheap and illegal labor that they can exploit at the expense of working class americans ( and mexicans for that matter ) . 
  there certainly are criminals and cartel members among the millions flooding across our border . 
  that 's fact . 
  he never said they all are though . 
  how did northern europeans survive the tens of thousands of years before central heating was invented ? 
  if they ca n't handle cold they should have thought of that before marching through an entire continents worth of milder climate countries . 
  only if you 're an economic migrant . 
  nothing wrong with them for the people working and paying taxes to support said migrants apparently . 
  legal immigrants are utterly irrelevant to the conversation . 
  they are not criminals . 
  if they do not hold us citizenship , they should not be working in the united states without a visa . 
  period . 
  if they are in the united states illegally they should be arrested and deported to their country of origin immediately . 
  period . 
  the us federal government should also put an immediate end to all so called `` sanctuary cities '' which are utterly unconstitutional and a direct violation of the rights and duties of the us federal government . 
  period . 
  illegal aliens have no rights to remain on us soil whatsoever much less work here . 
  notice how i specifically stated ** illegal aliens ** and you changed that to me having `` strong feelings about american immigrants '' in general , implying that i lumped illegal aliens and lawful immigrants in the same category . 
  but who 's really pandering to bullshit emotion you ask ? 
  but from your source :  by contrast , this paper studies the effects of immigrants on local labor demand , due to the increase in consumer demand for local services created by immigrants . 
  this effect can attenuate downward pressure from immigrants on non-immigrants ' wages , and also benefit non-immigrants by increasing the variety of local services available . 
  so , yeah . 
  hurt the wages of americans and in exchange we get `` authentic '' mexican food or something because that can only be done by an illegal worker ? 
  what a load of crap . 
  there 's nothing we were doing here before that we ca n't do now without illegal aliens . 
  even if it was economically beneficial , which i disagree with . 
  it would ultimately be irrelevant . 
  as we must still uphold our international borders and law . 
  trump has said nothing racist to my knowledge . 
  unless you count not wanting 11 + million illegal aliens and all the hardcore criminals and cartel members among them that are spitting in the face of our laws and everyone who migrated here legally and waited their turn and paid their dues `` racist '' .
