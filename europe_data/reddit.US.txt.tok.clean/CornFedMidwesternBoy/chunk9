  which many do in our country that 's apparently now running on `` feels '' instead of solid economics and the backs of working class americans who are hugely harmed by the devaluation of the labor market and the utter disregard shown by large corporations for labor and immigration law . 
  but your friends are also probably redditors and thus also probably members of the faux-intellectualist petty-bourgeois themselves . 
  is that supposed to be jan pawel 's corpse propped up on the tank o_o ? 
  because i never disputed that the politics are a huge part of the issue ? 
  i only took issue with you saying it dates back to the 50s . 
  it 's not * that * bad . 
  our trains and rail lines in chicago are not from the 50s , it 's the largest and busiest rail hub in north america . 
  my grandfather worked the lines for 50 + years . 
  the passenger systems leaves much to be desired because freight almost always gets priority but the train is pretty convenient 50 + miles out of the city and you can easily get an amtrak to go basically anywhere . 
  you also have to keep in mind here that the chicago metro area has a population greater than sweden in a relatively tight area . 
  yeah , miami , which is in the very southern tip of the state . 
  hence the further north you go the more culturally southern it gets . 
  lol these are chicago unions and politics we 're talking about here . 
  say that as someone from there and a proud union home . 
  in florida the further north you go the more southern it gets . 
  no , instead here they get called satanists . 
  if the politicians are already this delusional why do you think they 're not going to start passing out swedish citizenship like candy ? 
  especially if they feel they 're not going to get reelected ? 
  marines are n't allowed to die without permission :( semper fi , rest easy . 
  thank fuck they are n't us citizens . 
  i think the word you 're looking for is `` terrorist ''  ter \u00b7 ror \u00b7 ism  \u02c8ter\u0259\u02ccriz\u0259m  noun  the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims . 
  they 're certainly not in any danger beyond maybe burning themselves to death as they set fire to the tents . 
  they 've passed through how many safe countries now ? 
  what violence and war are they fleeing exactly at this point ? 
  they did . 
  a whopping 5 yards . 
  correct . 
  if you kick it through after a touchdown it 's one point ( this is only like a 10 yard try so it 's 99.99 % automatic for professional kickers ) whereas the 3 pointer is for when you can not get in the endzone and can be anywhere from a 10-55 + yard try . 
  please yourself , it 's one of the most strategically complex sports in the world . 
  every single play the offenses and defenses are shifting formations and calling audibles , shifting line protection , sending players in motion , etc. 
  nfl playbooks are the size of phonebooks and players are expected to have them memorized .

  the players ( some ) drink too  pierzynski joined katie nolan on fox sports ' garbage time , and admitted he 's been known to toss back a few `` rally beers '' from time to time . 
  `` sometimes , you 're in the 15th inning of a game , and you 're six hours in , and one of the starting pitchers is 12 beers in , and you 're like , ` man , i 'm really jealous of this guy over here . ' and then the next thing you know , they 're like ` rally beers !, 
  ' '' http://uproxx.com/sports/2015/06/aj-pierzynski-drinks-rally-beers-during-games/  another cool story is when babe ruth visited chicago for a game against the white sox . 
  the opponent players afraid of his far hits , and familiar with his reputation as a heavy drinker , took ruth out the night before . 
  a friendly bartender did his part by overserving ruth horribly . 
  in the end he was so smashed that everyone was convinced there was no way he could harm the hometeam . 
  ruth showed up for the game without any sleep and still fairly loaded . 
  not only did he dominated the game in an impressive way , after it he shocked the players of the white sox by asking where they were going for drinks this time . 
  one `` play '' or `` down '' is from when the offense takes position and `` snaps '' the ball ( begins the action ) until the ballcarrier is forced to the ground , out of bounds or scores . 
  football is way easier than baseball in terms of basics . 
  offense has four `` downs '' or plays to advance the ball ten yards and gain a new set of four downs . 
  advance the ball into the opposing endzone for a `` touchdown '' and it 's 6 points . 
  extra point play after a touchdown where you can kick the ball through the goalposts for one additional point or attempt to advance the ball into the opposing endzone again for two points . 
  fail to advance the ball into the opposing endzone and you can kick it through the goalposts for three points . 
  four 15 minute quarters in the game . 
  i would say the only thing more complex about football are the penalties . 
  bare basics . 
  game is nine `` innings '' , each inning is divided into 2 commonly called the `` top '' and `` bottom '' of the inning . 
  home team always bats the second half or `` bottom '' . 
  the playing field is divided into the `` infield '' , the dirt area where the four bases are , and the `` outfield '' , the grass beyond the infield but before the boundary outfield wall . 
  teams are n't limited to 9 players but while the team is on the defense they can only have 9 `` fielders '' out on the field . 
  the pitcher ( throws the ball to the batter ) , the catcher ( the guy wearing all the protective gear who catches the pitches and defends home plate ) . 
  the `` infielders '' : a first baseman , second baseman , third baseman and short stop ( guards the space between second and third base ) as well as the `` outfielders '' : left , center , right . 
  other than the pitcher and catcher there really is n't a `` set '' place they have to be while defending and defenses will often move around when different batters come to the plate and defensive scenarios evolve . 
  pitcher throws the ball to the catcher , batter on the other team tries to hit it . 
  you get three misses or `` strikes '' before you 're out ( a `` strikeout '' ) . 
  you can also get a strike by either not swinging at a ball thrown in the `` strike zone '' ( from the knees of the batter to his chest ) or by hitting the ball into `` foul territory '' ( but you can not receive a third strike from hitting a `` foul ball '' ) three outs and the other team is at bat . 
  if you get hit by the pitch you get to advance to first base ( note that you can not stand in front of home plate or intentionally step into a pitch and the ball is generally being thrown at 80-100 + mph and have killed people in the past ) . 
  batters will oftentimes `` crowd the plate '' by standing very close to home plate in order to minimize their inside strike zone . 
  pitchers will often counter this by intentionally throwing the ball close to the batter or even `` headhunting '' ( intentionally throwing the ball at the batters head which is illegal and pitchers can be ejected for this ) . 
  sometimes when a batter is hit by a pitch they will `` charge the mound '' and `` physically confront '' the pitcher . 
  this can sometimes lead to brawls between the two teams ( referred to as the `` benches clearing '' ) . 
  [ good example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vizb9o24bee ) . 
  a `` perfect game '' is when a pitcher wins a game ( pitching a minimum of nine innings ) in which no opposing player reaches a base . 
  this has been achieved just 23 times in mlb history , the most recent in 2012 . 
  a hitters `` batting average '' is his number of hits divided by his number of at bats . 
  presented as .000 . 
  in the modern game a season batting average of .300 or better is considered excellent . 
  just three players in league history have a career batting average over .350 ( ty cobb , rogers hornsby and shoeless joe jackson who all played in the 1910-1930s ) . 
  a season batting average of .400 + has only been achieved 28 times with ted williams being the last to have done it in 1941 . 
  in 1909 a ball with a cork center was invented and the `` dead ball era '' ( in which defensive strategy reigned supreme over offensive hitting ) is considered to have ended by the emergence of babe ruth as a power hitter in 1919 which often makes it difficult to compare those statistics to their modern counterparts . 
  there are four bases . 
  first , second , third and home plate where the batter , catcher and umpire ( referee ) are . 
  you can only advance to first by hitting the ball , being hit by the ball or being `` walked '' . 
  you 're `` walked '' when the pitcher throws four `` balls '' ( pitches thrown outside the accepted `` strike zone '' ) . 
  pitchers will sometimes intentionally walk players known for their hitting ability when a player is in scoring position . 
  skilled pitchers can manipulate the flight path of a pitch by alternating their grip on the ball and their throwing motion . 
  the most common pitch is the self-explanatory `` fastball '' in which the pitcher throws the ball as fast and hard as he can into the strikezone . 
  throwing an off-speed slow pitch to catch batters off guard is called a `` changeup '' . 
  pitches where the ball changes its motion in flight are referred to as `` breaking balls '' . 
  the most common are the `` curveball '' ( pitcher adds a spin to the ball which causes it to curve as it approaches the plate ) and the `` slider '' ( where the ball moves laterally and downward as it approaches the plate ) . 
  batters have just a split second to determine whether to swing and the speed and movement of the incoming ball . 
  pitchers will also sometimes throw `` knuckleballs '' which minimizes the spin of the ball and causes the pitch to be erratic and unpredictable which makes it difficult for batters to hit but also difficult for pitchers to control and catchers to catch . 
  a `` spitball '' is an illegal pitch where the pitcher applies a foreign substance ( usually his saliva or petroleum jelly ) to alter the flight path of the ball . 
  when a pitcher strikes out a player this is marked down on the stat sheets as a `` k '' . 
  fans will oftentimes keep track of a pitchers strikeouts in a game by hanging large `` k '' posters over the outfield wall . 
  i once had to explain to a visiting foreign friend that there was ** not ** a large group of ku klux klan members attending a game when the pitcher had three strikeouts . 
  if you 're on a base , you 're `` safe '' . 
  that is to say you can not be `` tagged out '' by a member of the defense with the ball . 
  if you 're not on a base you 're fair game to be tagged out . 
  a baserunner can not leave the `` baseline '' ( an imaginary straight line between each base ) within reason or he is automatically out . 
  if you hit the ball and a defensive player catches it before it hits the ground you are out . 
  any player that advanced while the ball was in the air must go back and touch the base he advanced from before he can advance further or he is * not * safe at the next bag . 
  so say you 're batting , there 's a man from your team at first base , you hit the ball into the air and a defensive player catches it . 
  you are out , your man at first needs to return to first base to be `` safe '' , he can advance but only if he `` tags up '' at first base before he does . 
  now , say your man is at second base and you hit the ball and it 's caught in the air . 
  he does not have to advance but could .
