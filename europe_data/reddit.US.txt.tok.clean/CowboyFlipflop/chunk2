  of course the only reason we 're not under attack right now is the atlantic ocean . 
  ^ ( i 'm here in my american safe ~ ~ space ~ ~ place . ), 
  i think everyone missed your joke here . 
   `` we are currently investigating ... why the security guard opened fire '' lol, 
  our state department ( travel.state.gov ) does this all the time , yes . 
  every page says something like `` you have to follow the local laws or else you 're in danger of being arrested . '', 
  `` you have to be on the lookout for pickpockets . '', 
  `` stds exist . 
  therefore japan is a scary place . '', 
  what are `` european style gloves '' ? 
  what does `` european style '' mean ? 
   franco roberti , head of italy 's a prominent anti-mafia judge told we 're missing a few words here . 
   vehabis '' [ wahabists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wahhabism ) '' in english i 'm guessing ? 
  the `` regressive left '' is not a myth . 
  cheese, 
  you 're getting downvoted for asking about english . 
  you 're from poland . 
  i did n't think you deserved the downvotes . 
   downvote for asking about english, 
  sounds like the [ french terror ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reign_of_terror ), 
   made a weird throat noise . 
  he was speaking swiss . 
  what the duck, 
  welp , that was horrifying . 
  good thing it 's morning . 
   diyanet ministry that sounds like [ scientology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dianetics ) is your state religion . 
  sorry , just a joke . 
  where it always smells like kangaroos . 
  roma got ta romance . 
  the last soviet republic, 
  yup and the same % of gypsies and jews were killed . 
  none ? 
  nowhere ? 
  you have so much experience beheading fishes . 
  you 'd be great at it . 
  `` russians '' `` britons '' `` frenchmen '' , and everyone 's boogieman `` belgians . '', 
  no , that 's something i 've never heard of before . 
  he means phage -  bacteriophage . 
  it means make yourself better by getting bacteria sick . 
  i wish we did n't, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banjo probably a mix of a west african instrument and a european guitar . 
  i was n't sure if you were trolling up to this point . 
  i ca n't believe he 's still arguing with you . 
  i ca n't say i 'm surprised this is an exaggeration . 
  i 'm sure the streets get a bunch of new hookers whenever everybody loses their jobs but that seemed a bit extreme . 
  just do n't barge in when they 're alone . 
   or he 's referring just to islamists or christianity/islam . 
  or the lingering bits of feudalism europe still has/the new dictatorships and monarchies of islamic countries . 
  why would someone do that to a car ? 
  well , the whole country is poor two gals . 
  everyone wants germoney instead . 
  `` ethereal excrementor '' `` otherworldly output '' `` shit specter '' `` asshole of the afterlife '' `` bunghole boogieman '' `` rump reeker '', 
  i thought this was a russian joke at first . 
  yeah not disagreeing with you . 
  i just thought it was funny . 
   in campaigners believe that the outpouring of sympathy in britain for france over the massacre will help rather than damage the pro-eu cause . 
  you 're still allowed to think nice thoughts about the french . 
  you can still hope the french do n't get blown up without letting 100 % of them and their muslims move to britain at any moment . 
   too many middle-easterners in germany , huh ? 
  with their non-indo-european religions . 
  2000 years ago . 
  they 're not black , yes , but there are much lighter people at the top of the world than them . 
  crap . 
  i ca n't read german . 
  itt : everyone critiquing the map as a population density map . 
  [ here ] ( https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/06/europa_beventw20012011_maponly/532c3df08.jpg ) is a map which is strictly population density . 
  ( [ here ] ( http://cache.eupedia.com/images/content/europe_density_map.jpg ) is a pop density map that hates the slavs for some reason . ), 
  using both maps lets you compare definition of a municipality/density/town density/data collection methods . 
  like a [ baby dragon ] ( http://pre03.deviantart.net/1f2d/th/pre/i/2010/003/4/5/baby_dragon_by_mary1517.jpg ) on southern germany ? 
  poland knows . 
   six i 'm guessing : town , federal district , federal/kingdom level , eu . 
  what levels am i missing ? 
  county ? 
  fourth for a source that is not the daily mail . 
   they were closed at the time , and it was the conservative right-wingers that opened them up to immigrants in order to put pressure on the workforce ( they now blame the lefties , of course ) . 
  yup . 
   other than that , most muslim `` immigrants '' in france moved there from french colonies - they were already nationals when they immigrated . 
    same goes for spain and britain . 
  due to the rightist ideology of imperialism . 
  yep . 
   opening the borders is not the cause of these attacks or the perceived problem with muslim people . 
  but you 're contradicting yourself . 
  it indeed * is * the problem , it 's just not always the left that has opened europe 's borders . 
  yup . 
  i found this : http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/alanjohnson/100195901/is-slavoj-zizek-a-left-fascist/, 
  that 's what i meant yeah . 
  but closing the borders 50 years ago would have . 
  i understand your surprise . 
  germany is n't supposed to exterminate humans without austrian leadership . 
  to the mewish problem, 
  you 're germans . 
  it 's the first solution you think of . 
   we are a union without borders , our security must be without borders too . 
  that 's a good point . 
  the two have to go together , parallel . 
  cameron is a witch ? 
  this explains things . 
  you 're right that it 's easier , but then again getting into a country has some hurdles you have to jump over . 
  and france is somewhat frankish . 
  yes but apart from burning down our temples , razing our cities , raping our women , and refusing to follow basic hygiene ... what have the vikings ever done to us ?
