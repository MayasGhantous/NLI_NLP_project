   i mean , fuck me , even morocco/algeria/tunisia have had the berbers living among them for centuries . 
  the berbers are the original people there . 
  more like the berbers have had the arabs living among them for centuries . 
  downvote for a reasonable question . 
  this whole crisis is bringing out the crazy in everyone . 
  i understand - it 's a crisis , so it 's crazy - but i 'm not sure / r/europe is reading comments before downvoting .

  you 're funny . 
   `` we left turkey 10 days ago . 
  the trip was very dangerous for the kids . 
  i decided to leave syria because i want my kids to have a comfortable life , to study , '' siha said . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  the point of being a refugee is to flee from death , not a comfortable life or an education . 
  ** england ** no feelings . 
  hence the food . 
  ** america ** unhappy . 
  so we bomb the shit out of you . 
  ** australia ** even the electricity is showing its chinese heritage . 
  ** denmark ** hey ladies ... this is what makes your vibrators work .

  just what the internet was made for !, 
  thanks . 
  i was wondering if this was when she was working or after she 'd gone into politics . 
  ( wikipedia says she was a `` physical chemist '' so i 'm not sure what kind of sciencing she could have done with fishermen . ), 
  yup . 
  what ** troubleshooter11 ** said . 
  i think english used to not distinguish and some parts of america still do n't . 
  [ wimme soahkesuovva \\ ( mun album \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp0hjq7k5c4 ) in english , this is wimme saari 's `` birch smoke '' from the album * mun * . 
  wimme is a lap from finnish lapland and he usually sings what are called `` yoiks . '', 
  i do n't know what that is exactly but this song is probably a yoik . 
  i can hear the english -  swedish -  finnish in your head . 
  i mean my head . 
  i mean your head . 
  what makes a good man go neutral ? 
  lust for gold ? 
  power ? 
  or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality ? 
  so ... germany is doing anything necessary to make europe safe and diverse ... about that ... 
  you 're a friesen pirate ? 
  i want you to know how happy i am to meet my first frisian pirate . 
   of note , `` pennsylvania ` dutch ''' is not dutch , but rather a corruption on `` pennsylvania deutsch '' . 
  of note , `` dutch '' is not a corruption of anything but the old dialectical way of saying `` deutsch '' in english . 
  it 's also still the current way of saying `` germans '' in some parts of america , like where i live for example . 
  i see you know all the german words that i know . 
   some ~ ~ german ~ ~ guy on ~ ~ reddit ~ ~ accused me of being from stormfront . 
  welcome to the internet . 
  austrian asking a spaniard about swiss cantonal laws . 
  lol,

  zombie virus is transmitted by leeches . 
  as long as you pay your fine , no one need ever learn about the crime . 
  good point . 
  that 's exactly what this is like . 
  see ? 
  this is n't just a cliche . 
  `` it 's their culture . 
  we need to understand them . '', 
  is a real thing . 
   i 'm really starting to like you guys . 
  you 're saying god will not strafe england ? 
  * neck shot * sounds like a threatening name in english . 
  i think that was ** mrtambourineslo ** 's joke . 
   is our europe getting raided or is it normal ? 
  yes . 
  for the last few weeks now . 
  you have n't noticed ? 
  d8 m8 d8a m8a bring the d8a m8a, 
  interesting . 
  i 'm not from there so i wonder if other places do that too . 
  tbh most black people in the cities do n't have the anger , time , or mental illness for that kind of behavior . 
  and most of our black people do n't live in cities anyway , despite everyone 's conception of them . 
  most live in the country in the old south where blacknecks * really * do n't know much about angry rap culture . 
  i do n't know , but the rest of the world probably knows more about the wire than rural black people do . 
  not european , but just to clear up a misconception about us : no one says `` african american '' here unless they 're in politics . 
  black people are `` black people '' or `` black folks '' or whatever . 
  some older people will still say colored . 
  that 's pretty good . 
  or just for native american/poles . 
   warning : dutch language my ears thank you !,

   isle of wight flag more , but it 's very badly designed . 
  if you think that looks bad you should see our state flags . 
  most of them are indistinguishable blue . 
  my name is eastzone and i do not think this joke is funny . 
  i would like someone to explain this joke to me . 
  yes i know . 
  but since i can tell the difference i thought i 'd point out the difference . 
  california/vancouver/california / vancouver ... occasionally somewhere else in america . 
  occasionally england . 
  they do n't like to admit the rest of the world even exists . 
  vancouver might as well be america and it 's just a tax-based jurisdictional change . 
  can butanol ride in the back seat ? 
  the natives must feel like you 're one of them . 
  whatever that means .
