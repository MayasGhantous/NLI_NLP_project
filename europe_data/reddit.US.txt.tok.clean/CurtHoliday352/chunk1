true , but has n't putin tolerated a similar situation in chechnya ? 
  i mean ... * it 's a totally different situation * ... but it does show russian tolerance for father-son transfers of power , even in their own autonomous republics . 
   until even germany etc insisted that it should go through sweden . 
  which may or may not be related to the fact that the german chancellor who championed and approved the project went on to immediately chair the corporation building the pipeline . 
   what the hell was the point of libya intervention ? 
  what did it achieve ? 
  a secular state now turn by sectarian violence , with a bunch of islamists in charge . 
  great success that was . 
  it does n't matter what the point of it was . 
  what matters is ** you called for it ** . 
  the united states did n't call for it , the united states did n't even want to be involved with it that much . 
  but we helped , and basically led , it anyway . 
  if you start shit , you should be able to handle it yourself . 
  eu deal was brought forward when yushenko was still in power , and he was replaced by a democratically elected yanukovich who scrapped it . 
  and they could have voted him away and gone on with their european aspirations if they just waited for another year . 
  europe never intended there to be a revolution . 
  europe did not have anything to gain by it . 
  it was largely sponsored and perpetrated by the likes of victoria `` fuck the eu '' nuland and the us government , still is oh fuck off with that bullshit . 
  yanukovich was going to sign it than pulled away at the last minute , know what 's going on around you on your god damn continent dude , this happened only six-months , if not less , ago . 
  and * `` fuck the eu '' * nuland only said that because of the eu 's inaction and indecisiveness after protesters started dying , getting abducted and the government started passing draconian anti-protest laws . 
  and in my opinion , she was fully justified in saying-so to a fellow employee on a private phone call . 
  you ai n't never curse with a fellow worker ? 
  and i love how you gloss over the whole russian dick-deep involvement . 
   what , like spending 5 billion to bring democracy to a country and end up with a fascist government instead ? 
  fuck off with that amateur propaganda bullshit dude . 
   how does one start a revolution with a trade deal ? 
  did you see any european politicians prancing around on the stage in kiev ? 
  did you hear any phone recordings of european politicians discussing which opposition leaders they would prefer in power ? 
  do n't be silly . 
  i do n't know , are you blind ? 
  * lulz * have you seen ukraine ? 
  how does any revolution start ? 
  a spark . 
  you gave the ukranian people hope for the eu , you kindled the flame , and it blew up in your face . 
  and influencing which opposition leaders meet with negotiations with the ukrainian government is important when you 're trying to keep order in a chaotic environment , or if worse comes to worse , have a stable transition if the president did step-down . 
  yes , we used our influence in the situation , you 're damn right , that 's what countries are supposed to do , ** that 's the point of soft power ** , and i love how you just skip over russia 's underhanded involvement in the whole thing , subverting the whole process . 
  europe did n't do shit . 
  they instigated the revolution , but they did n't do shit when protesters were being murdered , when authoritarian laws were being passed , they were n't doing shit at all . 
  so yes , * `` fuck the eu '' * for it 's inaction and indecisiveness on a paramount issue directly on their border . 
  america , a country half-a-world away , had a more cohesive and effective foreign policy than the eu over the course of this whole thing . 
  and that 's a damn shame . 
  it literally took russian soldiers invading ukraine for the eu to fucking step-up and develop some sort of cohesive foreign policy , and even now it 's handicapped . 
  for fuck 's sake , human rights abuses were going on right before your eyes in ukraine and you ai n't do shit . 
  also , russia never seems to get any criticism or blame from you , huh ? 
  * how odd ... * i guess everything and anything is ameri ** kkk ** a 's fault when shit goes wrong in europe . 
   and the only fascist shit i saw was the anti-protest laws and yulia tymoshenko , yanukovich 's only real opposition and political threat , languishing away in prison . 
  is n't he grooming his son ? 
  i recall seeing the kid dressed up in military uniform and meeting putin with his dad . 
  it 's funny , because the same people were saying ** `` russia will not invade ukraine !, 
  that 's fucking ridiculous you armchair neckbeards !, 
  this is n't the cold war !, 
  '' * and now it 's russia wo n't invade * `` the rest of ukraine '' * . 
  ** lulz **, 
  [ no problem sir ] ( http://realitybasedbob.sayanythingblog.com/files/2014/02/cryingeagle11.jpg ) :'), 
   there is no reason for eu to rev up anything right now . 
  much less so if it means investing more into nato . 
  did nato actually manage to accomplish anything of value , that justifies preserving it at all ? 
  well ... sure ... if you completely ignore the fulda gap , the balkans , libya and mali , yeah , you got a point . 
  replacing reality with your own version of it works wonders . 
    what , are you suggesting that zee russians are going to invade the eu ? 
  uk , france and italy each have more military power than russia does . 
  eu has enough deterrence as it is . 
  this whole shitstorm in ukraine was stirred up by americans anyway . 
  thanks obama , now we got a fascist state on a brink of civil war at our border !, 
  the whole shitstorm on your border was stirred up by a eu associated deal which * you put forward * and it was inflamed by reforms * you demanded * as a condition of it . 
  and than when things got out of hand , protesters starting getting shot and the government started passing draconian anti-protesting laws , you dropped the ball and did n't do shit , at which point america picked up the pieces to the mess * you started * . 
  thanks eu . 
  :d and it 's odd ... the estonians and polish always head to the united states for military assistance instead of the non-existent eu military . 
   you ca n't even maintain the confidence of your own member-states . 
   yeah , and each of these ( probably mali eventually ) ended in a big waste and failure . 
  whats the point in spending hundreds of billions on your military force if you ca n't achieve the political goals that you have set ? 
  does n't matter how it ended , the point of the matter is ** you called for it ** and then ** could n't handle it ** . 
  kinda like ukraine ; see the running theme here ? 
  starting shit you ca n't finish because you did n't prepare enough for it ? 
  and it 's odd , the balkans did n't really cool down until america got involved and actually gave the peacekeepers some teeth to their bite . 
  or are you forgetting about srebrinca which happened right under the nose of eu peacekeepers ? 
  or that the whole situation spiraled out of control because of european inaction and indecisiveness * ( wow ... there 's that running theme again ) * ? 
   yeah , go for it !, 
  mind you that these guys would n't even need any reassuring if ukraine just waited until the next elections . 
  instead you send them this douchebag and ruin the balance in entire region . 
   i 'm not advocating isolationism or anything , but like you said , this is n't the cold war anymore . 
  eu should let the us sort out its geopolitical ambitions alone and just focus on defense at home . 
  then let us ? 
  * lulz * when you want to do something like mali or libya , ** be able to do it yourself ** . 
  when you want to start shit in ukraine with a trade deal that has extensive reforms as a condition and who 's offering riles the population into a uprising , ** then be able to clean up the mess and handle the fall-out ** . 
   there is no reason for eu to rev up anything right now . 
  much less so if it means investing more into nato . 
  did nato actually manage to accomplish anything of value , that justifies preserving it at all ? 
  agree to disagree ? 
  i understand your logic , i do , as sometimes to learn to swim you need to be pushed in , but i still think we can still convince europe to integrate and increase military spending without cutting off american influence * ( to the degree it is ) * on the continent . 
  yes , but american identity is a mix of ethnicities , which is what i think the original poster was implicating . 
  i disagree , i think the recent events in crimea go to show that europe very much * does * need american protection . 
  and yes , the european union integrating militarily and establishing some kind of coherent foreign policy would be ** fucking awesome ** , but we 'd be foolish to completely eliminate any and all u.s. influence on the continent just because we 're annoyed by them not doing it sooner . 
  we should be motivating them , not abandoning them . 
  to do so would not only be morally fucked up , but it 'd also go against our realpolitik interests . 
  it 's like shooting ourselves in the foot because our toe has a splinter . 
  i think she meant as it in there 's no single * `` american '' * ethnicity , which i believe is correct . 
  the closest you can get is wasp , but even then you have the italians , irish and all the other varieties of white people messing that up . 
  i have to disagree ** strongly ** with this . 
  yes , we should be able to focus less on europe and more the pacific/asia , but cutting off europe completely , the logistical network our military bases provides us there * ( thus increased power projection = increased hard power ) * and the influence a strong military relationship ensures us * ( increased soft power ) * would be damn foolish .
