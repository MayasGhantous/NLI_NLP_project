  exactly , the soviet madman was never true , and winter in russia is no longer the fear . 
  nuclear weapons have completely changed the game , and russia can no longer keep retreating until the enemy trips over it 's own feet . 
  nuclear weapons have brought russia onto the same level as everyone else , and made total war just as costly for them as everybody else . 
  it was n't like this in wwi and wwii . 
  quick , decisive and limited wars are the future . 
  i do n't think we 're on the precipice of darkness , but i 'm not foolish enough to think that we 're in a peaceful utopia either . 
  and i 'm not saying each eu member-state should maintain massive , conscripted armies with huge stockpiles of equipment or massive military-industrial complexes , but i do believe that they severely need to increase their power projection capabilities , so they can actually utilize those militaries they have , which are some of the most professionally-trained and technologically advanced forces in the world , against countries like libya or in scenarios i mentioned above without having to enact emergency measures , or having to rely on the u.s. for logistical and intelligence capabilities to carry out in the operation in a timely manner . 
  all that is required is a small , tailored , well-trained and well-equipped force which possesses power projection . 
  european militaries * ( well most of them ) * have all of that ... except for the power projection ... which even france and the united kingdom need to focus more on as libya has shown . 
  and i believe china is the best country to back up my example . 
  they have a huge population , a large amount of territory and the world 's largest reserves of rare earth materials , with overland borders with some of the most natural resource-gifted nations in the world * ( i.e. 
  russia and central asia ) * . 
  but despite that , even their military leadership has began implementing a doctrine of * `` short , limited & decisive '' * wars in potential scenarios against nations they have territorial disputes with in the south china sea , many of whom , like nato , have mutual defense pacts with the united states . 
  ** edit : ** and estonia was a wrong example , i should 've just stuck to ukraine for such a hypothetical scenario , so if you do n't mind i 'd ask you imagine that instead , a place of contention that is nether russian soil nor eu/nato soil . 
   the funny thing is that i generally agree with you in terms of eu nations meeting their nato obligations , even though i stop before your desire for a unified eu military or a more `` active '' force , it 's kind of absurd that this long after the cold war we still let nato members shirk their responsibility and i 'd like to see that change . 
   my problem with your position is that you use examples as proof of your argument that are wholly inappropriate , like how you say that libya is proof that the eu needs the us to do anything which is patently not the case . 
  you can argue your position without trying to bend the facts to meet it ; saying that every time the us joins in on an operation shows that eu forces are incapable of acting independently is like saying that the us was incapable of handling iraq or afghanistan on its own and required help from other nations to invade - it just does n't join up . 
  but they are * incapable * of acting without u.s. support , at least for countries like libya . 
  sierre leone , the ivory coast , mali and car are all examples of where u.s. support is n't needed , but when it comes to semi-advanced states with libya with half-competent aa defense and a standing military , than u.s. help is * absolutely needed * . 
  iraq and libya are nothing alike . 
  it 's not even comparable to mali , because mali was n't motivated out of a plea of solidarity for international justification of the intervention like iraq was , it was about capability . 
  yes , france could 've more than handled mali itself , especially with the united kingdom helping , but it did n't ask for u.s. help out of solidarity , it asked because of capability . 
  america did n't ask for help with iraq and afghanistan because of capability , they asked because of solidarity . 
  the * primary * motivations behind each different . 
   the eu is already more than capable of taking on russia in a conventional war , just because our spending and power is skewed towards certain member states does n't mean we 're woefully unprepared for a conflict should they force our hand . 
   it seems like a pretty moot point though considering the us would never stay out of a conflict like that even if they peeled back their european activity . 
  of course it can , because that 's a total war scenario . 
  it 's not one which relies on power projection and quick , decisive strikes . 
  it allows european countries to fully mobilize their educated populations and technologically-advanced military-industrial complexes . 
  preparedness * ( at least in comparison to the type of preparation needed for interventions like libya ) * is secondary when you have the time to align your entire country against it . 
  but let 's for example , say that estonia is invaded , or that in the slimmest fucking chance , eu member-states decide to intervene crimea . 
  american support is cut-off or unavailable for whatever reason * ( remember , it 's a hypothetical scenario ) * . 
  at this point , power projection is absolutely critical , because for all intents and purposes , i really do n't , * in my opinion * , think that either the european union or russia want to escalate into a nuclear confrontation , or start mobilizing in a * `` total war '' * scenario , because then the chances of nuclear holocaust are all be inevitable * ( and why it probably will never happen ) * . 
  so in my opinion , in such a scenario , both russia and member-states of the european union would want to keep it as limited and short as possible , as both know they 're playing with irradiated fire . 
  it 's the same doctrine the chinese military is applying to contested territory in the south china sea when faced with the threat of american reprisal * ( as per our mdp with countries in the region ) * . 
  so , even when talking about russia instead of libya , the need for power projection and increased military funding/preparedness is still absolutely critical . 
  of course ... this is the same logic the confederacy used in the american civil war and the german empire used in wwi ... both of which inevitably ended up as * `` total war '' * scenarios ... but fuck ... i think the point still stands ; and who knows what would 've happened if lee captured washington or moltke the younger captured paris * ( without churchill as prime minister to buoy the home front ) * in the very first phases of each war ? 
   i 'm not in high school , alright dude i 'm not even in college . 
  i 'm a 19-year old burnout trying to get my ged after 7 years of some serious fucking mistakes . 
  but i do n't believe that takes away from the merits of my argument , especially since that same argument has been voiced by people much more credible and experienced than me . 
   do you seriously not get it ? 
  utilising us assets and capabilities does not equal proof that they are required . 
  do you seriously think european militaries started dropping cement training bombs on libyan military targets in some elaborate ploy to get the united states to help when they really did n't need help ? 
   your argument is that the eu is incapable of an action like libya without us involvement , in reality of course it 's able but why would you when us support is so readily available ? 
  ** of course it does n't in the long-term ** . 
  it 's the most developed and militarily advanced region on the god damn globe . 
  my point was it ca n't do it with it 's present standing military without taking timely emergency measures . 
  you ca n't be in the middle of a operation like libya ... and than just be like * `` oh , fuck , hold up gaddafi , give us a couple weeks/months so we can properly rev-up our military-industrial complex , logistics and intelligence gathering abilities . 
  thanks bud . 
  '' * you should n't have to take those types of measures when all that is being undertaken is regional bombing runs with no prospect of occupation . 
  it takes fucking years to build up power projection capabilities , ** so get on it ** . 
  a lot of men and a lot of weapons does n't mean shit when you ca n't use them when you need them , when you ca n't put them where you want them . 
  we both know war with russia is slim , but interventions like mali and libya are to be expected , so the military should be prepared . 
  you know ... is n't that a pretty fundamental part of any peacetime military strategy ? 
  military preparedness for the most likely scenarios ? 
   what do you know about being in the military ? 
  you 're almost certainly some fat , student reddit neckbeard who thinks he understands military matters because he reads some dumb yank 's clickbait on fp , the whole reason i get angry with you is because you clearly do n't understand the basics and have zero willingness to learn - instead you dismiss those with more experience than you because you ca n't afford to have your warped worldview altered . 
   my only hope is that you grow out of it . 
  and what the fuck do you know about me ? 
  i do know enough to respect somebody 's position , without devolving into personal attacks on them . 
  i guess respect and a balanced conversation is n't something they taught you in boot camp , is it ? 
  do n't sit here and fucking get on my dick with your psychoanalysis bullshit . 
  i 'm not in high school , alright dude , i do n't got time for this bitchy catfighting where we trade mean girl barbs and put words in each other 's mouth like we got our panties in a bunch . 
  stick to the topic , or shut the fuck up . 
  respect and keeping focus , that 's something you should know something a little about , should n't it ? 
  you caught me bruh , bruh . 
  :d but really , it 's rather impressive you get internet access all the way up there in the bavarian alps . 
  how do you find the time to reddit between the goatfucking and yodeling ? 
  and it 's really easy to own a mercedes and boost your economy when your country abuses the low wages and living standards of the poorer eu members to artificially depreciate the value of your exports ... thus upping your competitiveness by draining the competitiveness of the weaker and poorer eu members . 
   but how strong is a foundation propped up by on russian natural gas and constructed through picking at your neighbor 's houses like a vulture ? 
   i mean shit , at least the [ united states actually made serious economic reforms following the great recession ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regulatory_responses_to_the_subprime_crisis ) , all while germany has failed to take a leadership role in the european union * ( which it benefits most from ) * and motivate the other members to make serious , wide-sweeping emergency reforms that are concrete and authoritative . 
  and you seem pretty confident about that german economy , but i do n't see why . 
  [ america came out of the recession four years ago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_great_recession ) , the european union did as well , but had [ a double-dip recession ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/15/eurozone-double-dip-recession ) shortly afterwards , [ which it only exited from last august ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/eurozone-exit-double-dip-recession ) . 
  in short , we * ( america ) * still have years of growth * ( albeit small ) * while europe as a whole still has years of recession/loss looming over it 's head . 
  we 've reached pre-2008 levels this year iirc , but europe still has a long way to go before it regains the ground it 's lost . 
  plus , america had a 2012 [ gdp growth of 2.2 % ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=u.s.+gdp+growht&amp;oq=u.s.+gdp+growht&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65l2j69i60j69i61j69i60.9043j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=utf-8#es_sm=122&amp;espv=210&amp;q=united+states+gdp+growth&amp;safe=off ) , compared to the european union 's projected 2013 [ gdp growth of .2 % ] ( http://rt.com/business/eu-gdp-q3-eurostat-707/ ) ( remember , the e.u. 
  was in recession in 2012 ) . 
  and since our growth has remained relatively stable , ** our economy is growing at something like 12x that of europe . 
  ** and our 2013 growth numbers are supposed to be even higher , so expect that multiple to rise . 
  if iirc , we 're even projected to surpass the european union 's economy by 2020 . 
  unemployment wise , the european union has a [ unemployment rate of 10.9 % ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=european+union+unemployment+rate&amp;oq=european+union+unemployment+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5239j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=utf-8 ) and the eurozone an unemployment rate of [ 12.1 % , which is projected to go up to 12.3 percent ] ( http://www.dw.de/oecd-predicts-record-eurozone-unemployment-for-2014/a-16953636 ) by the end of the year . 
  the united states has [ a unemployment rate of 7.3 % ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=united+states+unemployment+rate&amp;oq=united+states+unemployment+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5218j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=utf-8 ) , which is projected to [ fall below 7 % ] ( http://www.dw.de/oecd-predicts-record-eurozone-unemployment-for-2014/a-16953636 ) by the end of the year . 
  and to top it off , unlike germany and europe with russia , we 're [ no longer dependent on foreign energy like we used to be , and we wo n't be for the foreseeable future ] ( http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/earth_to_power/2013/04/us-natural-gas-reserves-hit-record.html?page=all ) , so we got that going for us too . 
   ** tl ; dr shit ... shit ai n't lookin ' too bad for america . 
  because there is a ** need ** for us involvement :  why on earth would we take action on our own when the us has so many assets here already and is our ally ? 
  for some pointless dick-measuring contest ? 
  this is real life . 
  so even when you call for the shit yourself , and you know you ca n't do it like libya , you do it anyway because you know we 'll have your back and fill the capability gap ? 
  that 's a stupid fucking doctrine , and for somebody who claims they were in the military , you should be the first to realize that 's a stupid fucking doctrine . 
  and you can keep downvoting and disliking my posts , it does n't change the facts . 
  and i 'm glad to see i got just as strong a emotional response out of you . 
  makes me just as validated and justified . 
   oh , and we 're not raping our allies . 
  * lulz * it was our allies who helped us with prism if you do n't remember you do n't follow your own country 's politics . 
  ** it 's not rape when it 's consensual . 
  **  you might have a misunderstanding of the word . 
   how 's that united country and nuclear umbrella going for you ? 
  hope you did n't mind us garrisoning the fulda gap for half-a-fucking century . 
   oh , and yeah dude , the future is totally with russia , just compare eastern germany to western germany , or poland/estonia with kazakhstan/belarus . 
  seriously , you 're building a fucking pipeline that completely circumvents poland .
