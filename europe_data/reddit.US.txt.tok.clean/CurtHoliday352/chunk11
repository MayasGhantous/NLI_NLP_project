  you 're giving russia the opportunity to not only increase europe 's dependence on russia 's natural gas , but economically isolating your fucking eu and nato ally . 
  now russia can cut off gas to ukraine and poland without cutting it off to the rest of europe * ( yeah , you can redirect gas from germany to poland , but at a huge fucking cost of suddenly having to re-direct enough fuel to power an entire nation , and irking russia at the same time , who germany just fucking loves to appease ) * . 
  ** where was germany in libya and mali ? 
  where was germany when poland requested extra security ? 
  where was germany when poland pleaded with them to cancel their pipeline with russia which could economically isolate them and increase european dependence on russian gas ? 
  where was germany with it 's outrageous trade deficit and export policies which is draining the life out of it 's neighbors ? 
  ** * germany does n't give a fuck about the long-term as much as you think it does , it only cares about the short-term and it 's immediate needs , no matter who 's dick it has to suck or crisis it has to ignore . 
  * it likes the status quo , so it tries to maintain the status quo by ignoring every fucking thing going on around it , which is a useless fucking strategy . 
  ** so who 's really raping their neighbors ? 
  ** there 's a reason that the united states shares such a strong relationship with the netherlands and the united kingdom . 
  there 's a reason we have such strong security relationships with poland and sweden . 
  there 's a reason that the franco-german brigade fell the fuck apart and france shifted towards more defense cooperation with the united kingdom and america instead . 
  ** we 're not trying to abandon eastern europe , economically and militarily , to russia like germany . 
  ** we 're not ignoring our allies in the european union when it comes to interventions in mali or libya . 
  we 're there when they need us . 
  we act when we 're expected too . 
  * germany does n't . 
  * ** believe it or not , you might be the savior of the european union , but you 're also it 's death nail . 
  ** your failure to take up a leadership role , your failure to help militarily when your european allies need you , your failure to properly align yourself with and push the interests of your allies like poland * ( choosing russia instead ) * is what 's going to kill the organization and keep the continent divided , not us . 
  so , good luck being the pawn of of russia , america and china in the future , bitch . 
  yeah , until he uses his clout as a ex-chancellor to chime in on politics and encourage appeasement of russian foreign policy so his own personal wallet can get fatter under the guise of * `` genuine political advice '' * . 
  he 's allowed to act in his own interests when he admits to acting in his own interests . 
  so it 's america 's fault for crimea ? 
  not your country 's hesitation and refusal to make a decision ? 
  get the fuck over yourself . 
  ** germany is absolutely fucking impotent in foreign politics by it 's own choice . 
  ** it 's whole god damn outlook revolves around appeasement and suckin ' who 's ever cock helps them economically . 
  snowden and the ** dragnet spying your own god damn government agreed too and cooperated with ** did n't bring this about . 
  and you 're really fucking quick to forget that russia spied on american , polish and european union diplomats and their private phone calls . 
  so by your logic , every u.s. decision in this situation is completely and utterly justified given it 's only a response to * `` invasive spying by a hostile nation '' * , right ? 
  everything my country does is justified by this , you said it yourself , so i 'm right in declaring so . 
   and you better support this response against russia too , because you have too , because you were spied on by russia as well , since you 're in the eu and a ally of poland . 
  right ? 
  that 's the logic you 've put forward , right ? 
   germany must accept the fact that it ca n't play both sides of the field . 
  it ca n't refuse to help other european nations in libya and mali , while having a ex-chancellor join gazprom and chair a corporation building a massive natural gas pipeline between russia and germany * ( while condemning eu members for taking too harsh a stance on russia ) * without it being considered a competitor and suspect , just as you consider us suspect . 
  an you drop that word * `` hostile '' * a lot , but you do n't know what the fuck it means . 
  we compete because our strategic objectives do n't align , but we 're not hostile with each other , so do n't be a fucking fool and claim it , alright ? 
   but it does mean we will have friendly competition , and it does mean we will spy on each other . 
  you are not the united kingdom bitch , you are the netherlands , hell , you 're not even sweden , we do n't trust you on certain levels and from a lot of the attitudes i 'm seeing and a lot of the past actions i 've witnessed , we 're completely justified in being concerned about certain areas . 
  ** but yeah dude , whatever , go build your pipeline with putin and follow your policy of appeasement . 
  ** i 'm sure fucking poland and romania , you know , your european union allies , will really enjoy this renaissance of russian-german relations . 
   the main competitor of eu is usa . 
  i think ... given the issues of natural gas , tension over eastern europe and the launching of russia 's eurasian union , that honor belongs to russia , not us . 
  sure , we 're competitors , but we have much stronger relations , alliances * ( nato ) * and in the case of the united kingdom or the netherlands , special relationships than russia has with any european members . 
  i mean , hell , yeah the spying shit is fucked , but the dragnet your governments were just as guilty , and on the merkel phone taps and eu office wiretapping ... well shit ... you just admitted yourself we 're competitors , so it 's still fair-play . 
  and the tension between us over that has never reached the level it has with russia over ukraine or other eastern european countries * ( to the point of using gazprom as a weapon ) * . 
  yes , but that might take too long . 
  if you want to prevent nuclear escalation , if you want to prevent a * `` total war '' * scenario from breaking out * ( which nobody wants , cause it usually leads to that whole nuclear holocaust thing ) * , you need to be quick , you need to be decisive . 
  in my opinion , both russia and the united states , if god-forbid , a conflict ever did break-out , would want to keep it as limited and short as possible , as both know they 're playing with irradiated fire . 
  it 's the same doctrine the chinese military is applying to contested territory in the south china sea . 
  so yes , usually , if you had the benefit of the doubt , you * would * sanitize the whole baltic before you moved in ... but you might not have that benefit . 
  you might need to get paratroopers and marines into the ao * immediately * , at least quickly enough to open up a enclave and prevent the country from falling completely . 
  at least than the fighting is still focused on that specific contested area , and not spreading like a wild-fire across the region . 
  i mean ... if you do n't do that ... you 're mobilizing massive armies to move across huge swathes of europe ... ai n't no way that does n't end in nuclear devastation ... and i 'm pretty sure all the major powers realize that . 
  future wars , in my opinion , will be dominated by those principles i mentioned above : short , limited & decisive . 
  and you ca n't deny all the things european countries get out of american military power . 
  i do n't think anybody is saying this is a moral thing , though i think morality plays a strong factor , but i agree it 's mostly realpolitik . 
  that said , compare american realpolitik in western europe to russian realpolitik in eastern europe , or poland/estonia to kazakhstan/belarus . 
  i think it 's pretty easy to see which one is more beneficial , and which one , specifically in europe 's case , leads to a more open and democratic society with a more dynamic economy . 
  also , there comes a time when the negatives outweigh the positives . 
  back during the cold war , the influence our military protection bought us in the continent was invaluable . 
  but now ? 
  * not so much . 
  * we are moving away from our old europe-based strategy and * `` pivoting to the pacific/asia '' * . 
  there 's a reason they 're calling this the * `` asian century '' * , and america does n't want to be left behind , especially in a multi-polar world . 
  with this in mind , having to carry most of europe 's weight , as evidenced most strongly by libya * ( and the balkans i guess ) * , and to a lesser degree mali , is taking away from our overall strategy , instead of being the center-piece of it . 
  the game has changed , and america is changing with it , the only one who has n't seemed to get the memo is europe . 
  yes , and only russia recognizes russian crimea , but i doubt that 's gon na deter much or ease the tension . 
  maybe a chubby , i 'm not going to lie  i 'm very proud of the united states military and the stability , even if you deny it , it brings to the world . 
  iraq and the cia 's meddling during the cold war was a mistake , but overall , as evidenced by the commitment we provided to western europe through nato * ( canada as well ) * and our garrisoning of the fulda gap during the cold war , or our support of europe in libya & mali in recent times , or the mutual defense pacts we hold with many eastern asian nations which help maintain the balance-of-power in that region , i think we are a force of stability . 
  the american empire , the american hegemony , pax americana , call it what you want , whether as a insult or as a observation , but i think my point stands . 
  but i also realize the cost of war , as i elaborated too in another [ post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/204qc3/romanian_and_ukrainian_foreign_ministers_sign/cg05tzf ) :  nah , but seriously , i really hope war is avoided , because even a short war limited to ukraine would be insanely bloody and costly for all involved , and unfortunately , the worst-affected will be the innocent civilians caught in the cross-fire * ( not mentioning the refugees your own country will be flooded with , or the regional economic effects that a gazprom cut-off would have on the short-term ) * . 
   that said , nato definitely should n't go down the road of appeasement either . 
  it has n't done it , because it has no intention of doing it . 
  and you have no evidence to the contrary . 
  all you 're doing is sprouting unfounded assumption with no concrete basis . 
  but the pipeline does exponentially increase europe 's reliance on russia 's natural gas * ( which is the complaint poland is raising ; ala the headline ) * , and allows russia to cut the pipeline off to poland and ukraine without cutting off the rest of europe , thus potentially isolating both countries economically from the rest of europe . 
  of which there is ** plenty of evidence ** of russia doing in the past , and ukraine-russia-poland relations * ar n't really the highlight of the region * . 
  poland is damn right in opposing this . 
   i do n't think we 'll be the winners . 
  ] ( http://quickman.gameological.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/130703_inventory_birds_featured.jpg ) you ai n't got nothin ' to fear with that bird-of-prey above brother . 
  nah , but seriously , i really hope war is avoided , because even a short war limited to ukraine would be insanely bloody and costly for all involved , and unfortunately , the worst-affected will be the innocent civilians caught in the cross-fire * ( not mentioning the refugees your own country will be flooded with , or the regional economic effects that a gazprom cut-off would have on the short-term ) * . 
  that said , nato definitely should n't go down the road of appeasement either . 
  * lulz * ** when has poland ever done that ? 
  ** do you have a source , or are you just sprouting bullshit ? 
  [ replied here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/204xwk/fifteen_years_on_ukraine_neighbours_glad_to_be_in/cg0580k ), 
  yes , but it should at least make you up military spending , if not to nato required levels , at least to a level which ensures you can take care of a small , rag-tag army using old soviet hand-me-downs with no power projection capabilities what-so-ever without relying on a foreign power to give a shit ton of support as a necessity * ( instead of them helping out of solidarity ) * . 
  especially with a intervention ** you called for . 
  ** i mean ... if you ca n't handle that ... . than * what can you handle ? 
  * for all intents and purposes , your standing military would be wiped out by a modern foe before you had a chance to mobilize the rest of your population and industry , let alone your reserves . 
  and hell , even with a total war scenario being unlikely , that just makes a standing conventional force capable of proper power projection ** that much more important ** . 
  because let 's say conflict with russia * does arise * over ukraine * ( or even estonia ) * , chances are , either would be a limited , quick war * ( to avoid nuclear escalation ) * , not a long drawn out one where you have time to gather all your resources and men , so the most valuable asset * ( in this scenario ) * is a well-funded military with the infrastructure necessary to respond to regional crises decisively and quickly * ( time being the utmost factor ) * . 
  yes , but libya and mali , both of which were called for by european powers , both of which showed the short-comings of european power projection * ( specifically in the fields of intelligence gathering & logistical capabilities ) * even against third-world nations and both of which required american assistance * ( in mali much , much less ) * ** already happened ** . 
  and it happened * recently * . 
  those two interventions there should 've been the speed bump needed to wake europe up and get them on the road to that * `` radical rerragement of priorities '' * you were talking about it , but it did n't , and it has n't . 
  which is why , despite that , european countries needed extensive u.s. support in ** libya ** * ( quite the step down from mother russia ) * , to the point of basically being incapable of doing it themselves in a timely fashion * ( you know ... with their standing military ... and not having to enact timely emergency measures ) * ? 
  hell , the logistical capability of european countries is so bad they were reduced to dropping cement training bombs on libyan targets instead of actual bombs . 
  the same goes for intelligence gathering capabilities and first-strike capabilities . 
  the united states wanted to * `` lead from behind '' * , but despite that , was forced to be the tip-of-the-spear in taking out aa positions * ( mainly with tomahawks and stealth fighters ) * before the other european militaries could begin their bombing runs .
