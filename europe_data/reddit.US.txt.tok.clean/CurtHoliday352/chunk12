  and even mali , with france 's military funding and military preparedness , still required us military support . 
  * much , much less * ; but still necessary overall . 
  [ libya , europe and the future of nato : always waiting for the u.s. cavalry ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-fuure-nato )  america was visibly reluctant to get involved , let alone lead the action . 
  and , having helped to knock out libya 's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes , it pulled back from the front-line operations . 
  but america 's role remains essential , not least in providing air-to-air refuelling , as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the european allies . 
  [ nato commander : eu could not do libya without us ] ( http://euobserver.com/defence/115650 )  nato major-general marcel druart , addressing the european parliament committee on security and defence on tuesday ( 20 march ) , said nato relied heavily on us military expertise on intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( isr ) capabilities . 
  [ dempsey : france formally asks for u.s. aid in mali ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/ )  the french government has formally requested u.s. military assistance to combat al qaeda in the islamic maghreb in mali , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the american forces press service on thursday [ u.s. aiding france 's military operation in mali ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57563710/ )  * bamako , mali * - france 's foreign minister said sunday that the united states is providing communications and transport help for an international military intervention aimed at wresting mali 's north out of the hands of islamist extremists . 
   that 's a pipe dream . 
  modern western armies just do n't have `` millions of soldiers '' . 
  to get something like that together would take years , assuming it will be politically supported by people in western europe and the us . 
  no , but we do have the most professional and well-trained personnel core to expand upon , and as far as the united states is concerned , the most extensive and advanced intelligence/logistical infrastructure the world has ever seen to facilitate decisive and timely power projection just about anywhere in the world . 
  also , numbers for numbers , the united states * alone * has more men than russia , and as i said above , a more professional and trained personnel base to expand upon . 
   iraq has taught me that the us army has logistical problems sustaining a conflict even against a few tens of thousands of rag-tag militia members . 
  did ... did you miss the first gulf war or the first couple weeks of the iraqi & afghan wars ? 
  fuck ... we took down the entire taliban government with a couple hundred special forces directing a couple thousand other rag-tag militia members * ( northern alliance ) * . 
  conventionally , the united states military is unparalleled . 
  we 'd wipe the god damn floor with any military standing at the moment . 
  and what ... do you think ** polish civilians will fight american soldiers fighting with the polish government against russia ** ? 
  in a war with russia , if it does n't escalate into nuclear holocaust , and if it is n't limited to poland , we would only really have to worry about insurgents when we got to eastern ukraine or russia proper , not any time before . 
  and even then , a occupation is not guaranteed , all we might want to do is push russia back to it 's borders and go back to poland , not occupying anything . 
  my point is this : ** the united states will curb stomp any foreign military conventionally atm **, 
  poland is n't ukraine . 
  we 'll defend poland , beyond a doubt we 'll defend poland like we 'd defend japan , because poland is probably our closest ally in eastern europe . 
  whether talking morally or realpolitik , we 'd be a god damn fool not to defend poland , a god damn fool . 
  there 's a reason ukraine is n't in nato , i 'm sorry to say it , but it 's the truth ; you 're more valuable as a buffer state separating russia than a member-state bordering russia . 
  it 's too contentious . 
  if we made your country a member of nato , if we built up the same type of military relationship with you that we did with poland , we 'd be in wwiii right now . 
  well ... you know ... doing all this shit ... plus having a ex-chancellor get hired by gazprom and than become chairman of a corporation specifically incorporated to build a massive natural gas pipeline between russia and germany ... well shit man ... perhaps that spying on merkel and your government was justified from a realpolitik sense ? 
  i mean ... that 's what spying is for ... right ? 
  spying on countries who might become competitors and who 's strategic goals do n't align with yours ? 
  ** tl ; dr i disagree . 
  a limited war , like one in ukraine , which would be a conflict neither on nato or russian soil , could play out in a conventional manner , with the * threat * of nuclear holocaust keeping it limited and from spreading out of ukraine/crimea . 
  hence making fast-response and well-trained conventional forces capable of actual power projection * ( and fielding the logistical/intelligence infrastructure necessary for it ) * that much more important ** that 's not accurate , that 's not accurate in the slightest . 
  hell , if it was , the fulda gap would n't of been garrisoned for half-a-century and the soviet union would n't of been in a conventional arms race with the west all the way up until it 's fall . 
  plus , ** what if ukraine goes hot with nato intervening ? 
  ** do you think it would instantly go nuclear ? 
  do you think it would be a * `` total war '' * scenario ? 
  perhaps , but i do n't think it will . 
  i think it 'll be a a * limited conflict * , one where both sides try not to escalate or expand the conflict outside of ukraine , and one which power projection through conventional militaries will be the deciding factor ... which ... as far as power projection goes ... with the exception of france and the united kingdom ... all of europe is absolutely fucking useless at without the united states pulling most the weight , specifically in the areas of logistics and intelligence . 
  and even with the united kingdom and france helping , american support , even if significantly lessened , is still needed , as mali demonstrated . 
  also , if russia looses a conventional war in ukraine , would they go nuclear ? 
  well ... fuck they might ... i 'm not going to deny that ivan be going buckshit crazy and shit at times ... but ** would europe go nuclear over ukraine if they lost conventionally to russia there ? 
  ** would they mobilize for total war ? 
  no , i do n't think so , and russia knows this . 
  worst-case scenario , everybody plays m.a.d. , but ukraine is special because ukraine is n't in the european union and it 's not in nato . 
  honestly , it 's not even completely in the european union 's sphere-of-influence , and the chances of it becoming a eu member is still a long , long way off . 
  in putin 's mind , perhaps correctly , all he has to do is a win a limited , fast war , not a long , drawn out one . 
  and this is the same reason why china is practicing * `` quick , limited '' * wars , because them , like russia , know they have absolutely no fucking chance of winning a extended war against the united states . 
  than again ... that logic is also what germany was counting on during wwi ... 
  what the fuck germany ? 
  stop building pipe lines with russia and signing special trade deals with china you dick . 
   get over it , damnit . 
  ** it was almost 10 years ago ** yeah , but he just became ** [ chairman of nordstream ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream_ag ) ** , which is a corporation specifically created for , and tasked with , ** [ building a huge natural gas pipeline between germany and russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream ) ** . 
  so you agree with and support lobbying in the united states ? 
  because the logic behind that is the same logic you 're espousing . 
  it 's better in the open in the dark , it 's better to know where the money is coming from than not too . 
  but that was never a guarantee , only a assumption . 
  if it was a guarantee , than you would n't of seen the huge conventional arms race between the united states and soviet union , or the tension at the fulda gap . 
  and ukraine is hugely different . 
  it can end up being a ** limited war ** , which is n't something the european union is ready for , or capable of responding too , without extensive u.s. support . 
  it 's not like 1970 , when tensions were at a all time high and it was a zero-sum game . 
  this can be limited , a slowly-developing conflict , that even if it goes hot , might not go nuclear . 
  would russia be willing to go nuclear if they lost conventionally in ukraine ? 
  perhaps . 
  but more importantly , ** would the european union go nuclear if they lost in a conventional war ? 
  ** i do n't think so . 
  at all . 
  hence why if the eu launches a conventional intervention , * without u.s. support * , and they 're beaten back ? 
  well , that 's it . 
  i do n't see europe , even france or the united kingdom , mobilizing for total war over ukraine , a ally neither are tightly bound too or required to defend * ( i.e. 
  ukraine being a non-nato ally ) * . 
  so , all those people , and all those nukes , wo n't mean a god damn fucking thing if it means a non-nuclear , limited war . 
  what matters than is a cohesive , integrated and standardized military which is properly funded and capable of power projection far from it 's borders under it 's own power * ( i.e. 
  without u.s. help ) * . 
  also why china is training for fast , limited wars ; because they know it 's less likely to raise bring about a total war , nuclear scenario . 
  and it 's harder for america to keep up support on the home front when it comes to escalating a otherwise small conflict * ( i.e. 
  chinese seizure of filipino/japanese islands ) * into a full-blown war . 
  russia and ukraine are working on the same principle , only thing different being russia is a lot god damn better militarily * ( i.e. 
  or at least more capable of projecting power ) * than the chinese , and the europeans are much less willingly to go to war than the americans * ( nor , it could be argued , as prepared logistically and intelligence-wise ) * . 
  please , do me a favor and compare the effect that american influence had on western europe in comparison to russian influence on eastern europe , or hell , for a more recent example , compare the state of countries like poland and estonia with that of kazakhstan and belarus . 
  and when was the last time america threatened to cut off the oil/gas when europe did n't play ball ? 
  yeah , we 've done fucked up shit , we 've used our influence to move factors into our favor on the international scene , but we ai n't never pull the shit gazprom has , and places within our sphere of influence , specifically in regards to europe , have ended up being much more democratic and economically dynamic than those in russia 's sphere of influence . 
   turkey has given a us navy warship the green light to pass through the bosphorus within the next two days as tensions in ukraine 's crimea region continue to divide world powers . 
   turkish sources , speaking with the hurriyet daily news on wednesday , declined to elaborate on the name of the us warship . 
  the same officials told the daily on condition of anonymity that the ship in question was not the uss george h.w. 
  bush nuclear aircraft carrier as suggested in some news reports , as it did not meet the standards specified by the 1936 montreux convention in terms of weight . 
   the us vessel to pass through the straits will meet the convention 's standards , the sources said . 
  ** tl ; dr russia has nukes too , and we 're unsure if either they or you * ( french/british ) * would be willing to use them , especially in a limited war confined to a few eastern european countries * ( would france/britain go nuclear if they lost conventionally ? 
  would russia ? ) * . 
  plus , the interests of european nations conflict to a huge degree in relation to defense and foreign policy , and despite the standardization brought by nato , very strong differences/interests still exist , which russia can exploit , not just militarily , but * ( and probably more importantly ) * diplomatically . 
  ** eh , keep in mind , russia has nuclear weapons too , and is just as willing , if not more so , to use them than either yours or france 's government . 
  so let 's ask ourselves , if the european union loses a couple eastern european member-states to russian invasions , would they be willing to go to war with russia and risk a nuclear confrontation over it ? 
  also , if they did choose to do so , would either russia or europe want to go all out , or keep it a limited conflict restricted to the specified area ? 
  would russia or europe be willing to go nuclear if they lost conventionally in a limited war ? 
  i mean , a nuclear deterrent helps , but it did n't end the cold war , and it did n't stop us * ( america ) * from garrisoning the fulda gap and the soviets from garrisoning a fuckton of troops in eastern europe . 
  and it 's a given that if world war iii * did happen * , it would 've started with a conventional soviet invasion of europe * ( which from soviet plans would 've been supported by , but not dominated by , tactical nuclear weapons ) * . 
  a key part of the soviet plan was using the differences of european nations to their aid , with a specific focus on avoiding a attack on france in a attempt to keep them out of the war * ( iirc france had left nato at this point ) * . 
  although , i think we both know , chances are , if things did go bad , it 'd in a massive nuclear strikes which would leave a irradiated apocalyptic wasteland . 
  as for the rest ? 
  it does n't mean shit when you 're militarily divided and unwilling to sacrifice your own interests/security in the protection of another .
