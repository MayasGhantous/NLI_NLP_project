  for all intents and purposes , we are . 
  the more i think about it , the more i realize i 'm mistaken for doubting it . 
  but my main reservations comes not from us * losing influence * as much as it does from others * gaining influence * , like with the european union in soft power or russia/china in hard power . 
  so even if * no one state * rises to rival us single-handily , * multiple states * each chipping away at our influence individually and independent of each other will reduce our unparalleled stature in the world . 
  if that makes sense . 
  although you 're right , we 're still a superpower for the time being , but i think we might be reduced to the strongest of the great powers in the coming decades . 
  to be honest , in the future , i do n't think * there will even be any superpowers * , just great powers * ( america , eu if it integrates , russia , china , brazil with south africa & india coming up from behind ) * i 'm just not sure when that day will come or if we 'll even realize it when it does . 
   ** helsinki ** -- sweden 's government is examining a proposal to boost military spending to defend its own territories and the strategic baltic sea area in the face of renewed russian aggression in ukraine . 
  there is also a movement among high government officials to re-examine the long-running issue of joining nato . 
   the swedish cabinet will discuss , in coming weeks , a cross-party coalition proposal to significantly increase capital spending on the navy 's submarine fleet . 
   in a direct response to russia 's military actions in the crimean peninsula , jan bj\u00f6rklund , the liberal peoples ' party leader and sweden 's deputy prime minister , is pushing for a * `` comprehensive strategic military re-think on capability . '' * bj\u00f6rklund also wants sweden to * `` set the wheels in motion '' * to join nato . 
  well , there 's : [ united states ] ( http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-03-16/news/chi-ukraine-crimea-20140316_1_crimea-lenin-square-president-barack-obama ) [ germany ] ( http://www.npr.org/2014/03/13/289836905/germany-changes-its-tone-on-russia-and-eu-sanctions-may-follow ) [ united kingdom ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-26517583 ) [ france ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-crisis-sanctions-on-russia-could-come-this-week-france-says-1.2567759 ) [ spain ] ( http://www.thelocal.es/20140305/madrid-backs-sanctions-in-ukraine-crisis ) not to mention that the leaders of the [ g7 * ( united states , italy , united kingdom , france , japan , germany , canada ) * supported actions being taken against russia ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/12/g7-russia-crimea_n_4948982.html ) :  * `` in addition to its impact on the unity , sovereignty and territorial integrity of ukraine , the annexation of crimea could have grave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states , '' * they said . 
  * `` should the russian federation take such a step , we will take further action , individually and collectively . 
  '' * and i 'm sure there are others whom i am missing , sweden and denmark are two for instance that have taken a pretty hard-line stance against russia in crimea . 
  yes , but china and russia ar n't * `` unparalleled '' * or that much stronger than others . 
  japan is only slightly behind china in terms of economic strength * ( and it could be argued it much more stable ) * and russia is dwarfed economically by a great number of countries , although it 's natural resources make up for it somewhat , it still lacks in soft power . 
  militarily , china and the russia have * nowhere near * the amount of power projection the united states has . 
  it ca n't launch a 10 + year military offensive half-way around the globe , it lacks the logistical infrastructure * ( military installations , friendly ports , supply bases ) * and necessary equipment * ( aircraft carriers , refueling aircraft ) * . 
  so while russia excels in hard power * ( and it has a absolutely huge border so it has that advantage logistically ) * , it lacks in soft power . 
  and while china excels in soft power , it lacks in hard power . 
  plus , with the degradation and loss of soviet military infrastructure , russia does n't have the reach it once did ... it ca n't reach and conduct combat operations for a extended period of time like in afghanistan or eastern europe * ( by itself ) * anymore , it 's borders have gotten smaller , it 's loss warm-water and deep-water ports * ( as it 's struggle for crimea and syria go to show ) * . 
  china is still a economic beast , but in my opinion , a house-of-cards which depends on extraordinary growth , because if it 's growth ever grows stagnant , or god-forbid , goes into recession , in my opinion , the whole house comes crashing down . 
  it needs to keep momentum or it implodes . 
  in america , such circumstances would be like chopping a limb off , but in china , it 's like loosing your head if that analogy makes sense . 
  and , on top of that , i do n't think you can have more than two super-powers . 
  because once you move away from a bi-polar world and into a tri-polar or multi-polar world ... that whole * `` unparalleled '' * thing does n't really stand anymore . 
  you can , in my opinion , only have one or two superpowers . 
  once more states are able to compare to them , everybody reverts to great powers . 
  this is also the direction i see the world going into . 
  a * `` multi-polar '' * world in which america , china , russia , brazil and the european union * ( if it integrates ) * are the great powers , with india and south africa coming up from behind . 
  but , as of now , only the united states can be considered a superpower ... and even than it 's loosing that position fast and i do n't know how much longer we 'll hold the title , if we have n't lost it already to simply be the strongest of the great powers . 
  it 's nowhere close to what the soviet union was , both economically or militarily . 
  truth is russia is a great power , just like china , but it sure as hell is n't a superpower . 
  america is really the only country you can call a superpower with a straight face , and even then , i myself am unsure if we 're still that or simply the most powerful of the great powers . 
  but calling russia a superpower is ridiculous . 
   us military is a giant inefficient money drain . 
  i do n't see it as an advantage or something that somehow gives them more weight over their eu allies . 
  americans are just terrible with their books . 
  which is exactly why you need to rev up your military spending and integrate more so we have less influence over you . 
   and as i mentioned above , those bullshit projects you pointed out ar n't so * `` bullshit * '' after crimea . 
    eu went to iraq and they also went to afghanistan along with the us . 
  so whats the problem ? 
  that they still request logistics support from us ? 
  well , us requested logistic support from russia and pakistan during their gig in afghanistan , so whats your point ? 
  the united states could operate in afghanistan and iraq without the european union and without russia or pakistan . 
  this was proven clearly when pakistan cut off the supplies going to afghanistan and the united states still managed to provide supplies , albeit of less quality , to the soldiers . 
  see the difference ? 
  eu allies helped with iraq and afghanistan out of solidarity , we helped with mali and libya out of necessity . 
  do n't confuse the two . 
  point is , you 're completely incapable of acting by yourself when it involves power projection without the united states . 
  what if finland is invaded tomorrow and the united states does n't lift a finger because it 's not in nato ? 
  europe ca n't do shit . 
  you 're handicapped , and any action which requires strategic airlift or amphibious assaults , hell , * power projection in general * is determinant on the u.s. willingness to help , thus giving us influence and pull over you . 
  but if you enjoy the present make-up , by all means , continue with the * status quo * . 
  giving the united states undue influence over your foreign policy , and hell , even your domestic politics when it comes to security is a * awesome idea * . 
  though ... seriously ... despite all the benefits and influence it gives me country ... it 's distracting us from our * `` pivot to the pacific/asia '' * . 
  we have to draw forces away from there to reassure our allies in eastern europe * ( estonia , poland , etc. 
  ) * and to help with interventions in mali & libya , which is n't good at all for us . 
  this is n't the cold war anymore , our doctrine is n't based on a europe-based strategy anymore . 
  europe needs to get it 's house in order , there 's a reason they 've started calling this the * `` asian century '' * and america does n't want to be left behind because it 's distracted and tied down by europe . 
  ** note : and you should stop referring to the eu as a nation . 
  it lacks a integrated military and a cohesive foriegn policy , so for all intents and purposes , it 's not a nation . 
  trade deals are the exception , not the rule . 
  ** that does n't account for this though : ** [ libya , europe and the future of nato : always waiting for the u.s. cavalry ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-fuure-nato )  america was visibly reluctant to get involved , let alone lead the action . 
  and , having helped to knock out libya 's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes , it pulled back from the front-line operations . 
  but america 's role remains essential , not least in providing air-to-air refuelling , as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the european allies . 
  [ nato commander : eu could not do libya without us ] ( http://euobserver.com/defence/115650 )  nato major-general marcel druart , addressing the european parliament committee on security and defence on tuesday ( 20 march ) , said nato relied heavily on us military expertise on intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( isr ) capabilities . 
  [ dempsey : france formally asks for u.s. aid in mali ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/ )  the french government has formally requested u.s. military assistance to combat al qaeda in the islamic maghreb in mali , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the american forces press service on thursday [ u.s. aiding france 's military operation in mali ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57563710/ )  * bamako , mali * - france 's foreign minister said sunday that the united states is providing communications and transport help for an international military intervention aimed at wresting mali 's north out of the hands of islamist extremists . 
  and i do n't understand what point you 're trying to make . 
  the united states cutting it 's military budget does n't magically make europe more capable and efficient . 
  in fact ... * it does the exact opposite * ... . . we account for ** 75 % of nato 's defense spending ** . 
  and those projects were called * `` bullshit '' * because they were designed to fight large , advanced armies instead of low-tech guerrillas and jihadists . 
  but now , looking at crimea , a resurgent russia and nervous eastern european nato member-states ... perhaps those projects were n't such * `` bullshit '' * after all . 
   * moscow ( reuters ) * - russia 's government acknowledged for the first time on monday that the economy was in crisis , undermining earlier attempts by officials to suggest albeit weakening growth it could weather sanctions over ukraine . 
   moscow markets wait to see the full scale of western measures over the seizure of ukraine 's crimea and support of its referendum to join russia , after losing billions of dollars in recent weeks in state and corporate money . 
  man i 'm not sure if * my country * is a superpower anymore , so you got ta be smokin ' crack if you think russia 's a superpower . 
  but that does n't knock the potential of the f-35 , it just goes to show how important modern and advanced fighters are . 
  f-18s and eurofighters * still * would have to rely on f-22s , but the f-35 has to rely on the f-22 * less * and has a higher survivability than either * ( f-18 or eurofighter ) * in contested russian airspace , plus it can network and coordinate with drones acting as missile trucks for those saturation strikes you mentioned . 
  but yes , let 's simply concede we have differing views on the matter and leave it at that . 
  but i did enjoy the debate . 
  agree to disagree ? 
  i think the f-35 is the best option in any war with russia . 
  we can send in drones for saturation attacks , but when you need a man in the air , a dog-fighter , or simply a delicate operation executed , there just is n't any replacement . 
  plus , unlike the f-18 or eurofighter , one of the [ f-35 's capabilities is the ability to network with a number of drones ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2014/01/uavs-and-the-f-35-partners-in-air-power/ ) , thus it can use drones like missile trucks to fulfill those mass-wave attacks to overwhelm russian sam defenses that you 're referencing . 
  and keep in mind , we 're not under-buying the f-35 like we did with the f-22 , hell , [ the united states alone plans to buy up to 2,400 f-35s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f-35 ) , and if our allies stick to their guns , they 're supposed to acquire up to 3,100 f-35s on top of that as well . 
  the united states promised `` economic help '' if the ukranian government * agreed to reforms * , ** before ** russia invaded and began the process of annexing crimea . 
  the whole move came out of left-field and is still developing , so we ca n't throw around final judgments yet about the united states ' response . 
  and you keep acting like ukraine is a mirror-image of any conflict that might happen with estonia , but that 's just not the case . 
  one is in nato * ( with extensive military ties with the united states ) * and the european union , one is n't . 
  america does not view all others as subhuman scum . 
  but it does view people who think that as idiots . 
  * lulz * or do you consider people whom have pride in the european union or their own countries and it 's accomplishments as viewing all other countries and their people as sub-human ? 
  and you 're absolutely right , nato does n't matter when we 're talking about a virus which has targeted military facilities in nato countries and which supposedly originated from russia , which just invaded a country directly neighboring the eu . 
  yeah , but one country is in nato and integral to the defense of the continent and one is n't . 
  guess which is which , 
  that 's yet to be proven or combat-tested . 
  there is absolutely no evidence you can draw from to back that up . 
  but there is one thing you can probably count on , that the f-35 , in comparison to the f-18 , grippen or eurofighter , will still , more than likely , * have a higher survivability in contested russian airspace than any other fighter bar the f-22 * . 
  even if by mere minutes/seconds , and in a heated warzone , minutes/seconds can mean all the difference . 
  it 's not the * guaranteed * solution , but it 's the * best * solution .
