  the most reliable solution . 
  are you sure ? 
  because many on this subreddit are still calling him a warmonger and bully for threatening to bomb assad back to the stone age . 
  and who says it has to go nuclear immediately ? 
  if wwiii * does break out * , it 's going to start with bullets before nukes . 
  we just have to get enough marines and paratroopers into estonia to ensure it does n't fall , and to surround any-such town in question so it 's cut-off from the outside world and the only way russia can enforce such a measure is through military force . 
  and even then , it could stay limited to estonia and remain a short-affair . 
  in any conventional conflict , the united states is going to win , especially one which relies on power projection and fast-reaction forces . 
  so in such a scenario , the ball 's in putin 's court . 
  and if putin wants to start nuclear war over estonia , than that 's on putin . 
   the f-35 is not a real option in a conflict vs. russia . 
   it is a plane designed for conflict with a technologically inferior opponent . 
  i disagree , i contend that the f-35 is one of the * few * real options available in a conflict versus russia . 
  and i actually hear the opposite complaint , that the f-35 is a plane overly-designed for a conflict that 'll probably never happen * ( i.e. 
  china & russia ) * . 
  and this sentiment i hear very strongly from europeans , who insist that f-18s , grippens and eurofighters are sufficient for the guerillas/jihadists in mali , car and libya , and that the f-35 would be a waste of money . 
  i think that is a view which has been dispelled in the last week . 
  and , in my opinion , the f-35 has a much higher survivability than * any of those planes * when in contested airspace , especially contested russian airspace . 
   even 1 % of gdp would be fine - onyl for the eu , this would be ~ 0.13 trillion eur . 
  this would be more than russia could ever dream of . 
  which would be great ... * if the eu had a integrated military and a cohesive foreign policy * , but it does n't , so you do n't know who 's going to be willing to contribute to what or at what level of readiness they are . 
  look at libya , countries which were spending 1 % of their gdp were n't fine , they were reduced to dropping cement training bombs after their logistical lines gave out and before the united states got fully into play . 
  even britain could n't prop up the rest of it 's european allies in the operation . 
  mali also sticks out , because even though france required * much , much less * military support from the united states , * it still required it * , especially in the regards of logistics and intelligence . 
  [ i think that 's been the plan since april 2 , 1996 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_state ), 
   you 've got it backwards , gripen is about the only good thing about the swedish military * ( it 's also by far the most expensive thing ) * . 
  that 's kinda ironic ... since one of the gripen 's main selling points is it 's cost-effectiveness ; given how cheap it is in comparison to other fighter jets on the market . 
  yeah , if they were n't russia 's eurasian union would n't be getting off the ground this year . 
  putin wanted ukraine bad for the eurasian union , it would 've been the organization 's bread-basket and actually given it some-sort of real economic clout ... * but that did n't work out * ... so he just settled for the warm-water ports and ship-building industry of crimea . 
  absolutely , but the infrastructure needed to do such , the logistical network and intelligence capabilities especially , * cost a lot of money * . 
  especially when you factor in the fact you 're going up against ** russia ** . 
  it 's not libya and mali * ( which both required differing levels of united states support ) * , it 's a advanced and powerful nation with technology , while lacking in many regards , are still somewhat on par , especially when it comes to anti-aircraft defenses . 
  so not only do you need to purchase more strategic airlifters and airborne refueling tankers , but you also need things like drones for reconnaissance/intelligence and f-35s for stealth * ( because most other planes going into a russian-controlled airzone are probably going to have a bad day if russian sams have n't been eliminated ) * . 
  personally , and this is my armchair general opinion , it 's going to be very hard to develop the capabilities to do all that if you 're not spending at least 2 % of your gdp on the military ; so the lack of spending and the lack of general plan go hand-in-hand , and once again in my opinion , it 's hard to have one when you lack the other . 
   what does ** lulz ** mean ? 
  another insult obscenity ? 
  how 'd you know ? 
  it 's an old tibetan curse word , which roughly translates to : * '' [ censored ] your ancestors to the eighteenth generation '' *  i did n't realize my english was that bad that you keep on misrepresenting what i said . 
  but no , i welcome ukrainians , like all emigrants . 
  i have been an emigrant all my life . 
  but i know for a fact that 99 % of political asylum seekers are economic migrants . 
  this ** perverts ** the system of political asylum which exists for a reason ( for example for people like snowden ) and which has grown out of a long tradition of civil liberties in europe , dating back centuries . 
  so ... like i said ... you do n't comment at all on why exactly you do n't think the situation in ukraine constitutes one which would result in political asylum ... and instead just accuse them of all being free-loaders and justify it by saying there 's enough ukranians in western europe already ? 
  and if snowden deserves asylum ... than people who 's country just went through a chaotic revolution where dozens , if not hundreds , were killed and whom 's country was just invaded and a part of such annexed , with the russian military massing on their eastern border as well ... * do n't deserve the same treatment you propose for snowden * . 
  like i said : ** lulz **, 
  so you can support somebody calling merkel , a woman you 've never met , a american whore , but you get your panties in a bunch the second somebody implies you 're choking on russian cock ? 
  * lulz * double-standard much ? 
  can dish it out , but ca n't handle it back ? 
  and you can just ignore it and answer my main point , which i think i laid out pretty well , if it really gets you that mad . 
  my apologies , i crossed it out for you . 
   i did n't mean to hurt your feelings . 
  but i expected you to have a little harder skin new-atlantis . 
   especially after you posted a link about [ ** merkel being washington 's whore ** ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20jlik/pravda_washingtons_whore_angela_merkel_will_be/ ) and then [ agreed with the sentiment of the view here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20jlik/pravda_washingtons_whore_angela_merkel_will_be/cg44807 ) . 
  so ... your opposition to ukranians being given political asylum does n't so such much have to do with the political unrest going on there or the recent russian invasion of their country as much as it has to do with * you thinking there 's too many in western europe as is ? 
  * ** lulz **, 
  that 's all great and fine , but in 2006 , every member of nato agreed to spend at least 2 % of their gdp on defense . 
  yet , as of now , only four members meet this bare minimum standard iirc ; the united states , great britain , greece , and estonia . 
  france recently had to cut it 's military spending down to 1.8 % because of economic woes and austerity , while poland has continuously increased it 's military spending , which now stands at 1.9 % of their gdp . 
  but given france 's military commitment as evidenced by mali & car , and poland 's determination to meet the 2 % minimum in the very near-future , i believe both should be excused . 
  ** but that does n't excuse the other 22-members in nato ** . 
  and despite ~ ~ your constant choking on russian cock ~ ~ , this is just as important for defense as it is for power projection . 
   russia is a little more advanced than libya and mali , and any conflict involving them is going to require some very expensive toys to deter against their also-advanced toys , as well to retain the capability to strike within russia aa-guarded rear areas , and if i must remind you , russia has some of the most advanced aa defenses on the planet . 
   * london/boston : * a sophisticated piece of spyware has been quietly infecting hundreds of government computers across europe and the united states in one of the most complex cyber espionage programs uncovered to date . 
   several security researchers and western intelligence officers say they believe the malware , widely known as turla , is the work of the russian government and linked to the same software used to launch a massive breach on the us military uncovered in 2008 . 
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ** nato nations targeted **  security firms have been monitoring turla for several years . 
   symantec corp estimates up to 1,000 networks have been infected by turla and a related virus , agent.btz . 
  it named no victims , saying only that most were government computers . 
   bae said it has collected over 100 unique samples of turla since 2010 , including 32 from ukraine , 11 from lithuania and 4 from great britain . 
  it obtained smaller numbers from other countries . 
   hackers use turla to establish a hidden foothold in infected networks from which they can search other computers , store stolen information , then transmit data back to their servers . 
   nato officials released a list of the estimated 2013 defense expenditures of member countries on monday , saying the figures reflect the tough economic conditions key member states face . 
  officials from the u.s. expressed concern that europe is not doing enough to share the costs of nato operations at a time when new regional threats harm the stability of the alliance . 
   nato 's importance to the security of europe will continue beyond the 2014 withdrawal of u.s. forces from afghanistan , which currently comprise the majority of international troops there . 
  * ... * ** crimea was a incorporated region of ukraine ** , even if only because the soviets gave it to them in the 1950s . 
  russia recognized and acknowledged the territorial make-up of ukraine when they signed the budapest memorandum in 1994 , and confirmed it in 2009 . 
  if america garrisoned saudi arabia 's capital city and annexed it , ** it would be a invasion ** . 
  if america moved outside of guantanamo bay , garrisoned guantanamo providence and annexed it into the united states , ** it would be a invasion ** . 
  it 's not emotion , it 's simplicity . 
  i mean please , enlighten me , was the * `` bay of pigs invasion '' * ** not a invasion ** ? 
  i mean ... japan garrisoned manchuria for a damn little while ... was the second sino-japanese war ** not a invasion ** when they moved into the rest of china and annexed it ? 
  ** how ? 
  ** how do you not understand the difference between a authorized military base and a invasion ? 
  how do you not understand the difference between soldiers being restricted to a military base , and them moving , unauthorized , outside those bases , garrisoning a entire region and annexing it into their country ? 
  i mean ... ** holy shit ** ... 
  this is n't a emotional outburst , it 's the pointing out of a very simple distinction . 
  my apologies , you are correct . 
  but finland ** did ** assault the northern ussr and surround leningrad with nazi support in wwii . 
  this actually is n't that far-fetched . 
  i could definitely see , if america , for whatever reason , moves away from it 's commitment to defend japan , with japan than moving towards russia as a counter against china . 
  of course this would depend on either country forfeiting it 's claims to the kuril islands , but meh , desperate circumstances call for desperate measures . 
  although i ca n't see the united states doing this unless ** rand paul 2016 ** turns into a reality , and even then , i do n't think paul would be so foolish as to abandon such a stable and beneficial ally . 
  no , but mexican/new spain troops were in the southwest for almost 200 years before the texas revolution and mexican-american war . 
  so ... hypothetically ... . if mexico was allowed a naval base at galvensten after both wars ... than it would n't be a invasion if mexico used that naval base to ferry in soldiers and take over houston and a large part of eastern texas ? 
  america has stationed troops at gutanomo bay in cuba for damn near one hundred years ... so i guess it would n't be a invasion if we garrisoned and annexed guant\u00e1namo province ? 
  and i guess ... by this logic ... . . the * `` bay of pigs invasion '' * was less of a invasion and more of a. ... what 's the word you would use ? 
  embrace of shared history and culture ? 
  i 'm not emotional , just contending your notion it 's not a military invasion . 
  it 's not so much a emotional outburst as a tool of rhetoric . 
  ** edit : ** and i edited my initial post to clarify my point more .
