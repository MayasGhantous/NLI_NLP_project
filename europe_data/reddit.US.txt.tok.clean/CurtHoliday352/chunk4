  i made some rhetorical mistakes that did n't convey my main point as it was intended . 
  criticize the logic behind the edit if you want , but please re-read and give your opinion as it would be welcomed . 
   good , point . 
  so , military presence is not invasion , right ? 
  ** nope , it is the same logic in every single situation . 
  even if it 's constricted to military bases approved by the government where they 're located . 
  ** * by your logic . 
  * our presence in modern-day japan , modern-day germany and modern-day united kingdom . 
  i guess that ... and all-of-a-sudden garrisoning all of the cities of okinawa , bavaria and scotland * ( without the permission of tokyo , berlin or london ) * ... and then annexing those regions into our country ... * would n't be a invasion ? 
  * you ca n't argue with that logic . 
  you just ca n't . 
    you should learn your history because this was exactly the other way around . 
  because new spain/mexico did n't hold many territories in that region from the 15th century to the 19th century ? 
  also ... ** based on this logic ** ... russia sending troops into eastern ukraine would n't be a invasion either ... because of it 's shared history with the kieven rus or it 's incorporation into the russian empire/soviet union for two-hundred years ? 
  it 'd be less of a invasion and more of a reunion ? 
  ** breaking : ** the [ single-person commune of rochefourchat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rochefourchat ) in france has held a referendum regarding secession from the country . 
  the result of * `` maybe '' * has thrown the entire nation into disarray , with the french stock market falling at a unprecedented rate . 
  like i said , i 'm not arguing about what * might * or * will * happen , i 'm simply saying it 's foolish to act like either country is a non-factor if one or both of the region gains independence and pursues eu membership . 
   the commander of a u.s. military vessel says it will carry out more exercises with nato allied ships in the black sea . 
   the `` u.s.s. 
  truxtun '' took part in drills with romanian and bulgarian ships in the black sea last week a few hundreds kilometers from crimea where russia has deployed troops after protests toppled ukraine 's pro-moscow president . 
   the united states said the exercises were routine and had been planned long before the crisis erupted . 
   but they coincided with air drills carried out by u.s. and polish fighter jets in poland and nato reconnaissance flights over eastern europe . 
   ** brussels ** -- european and american officials had hoped they could highlight progress on negotiations for a wide-ranging trade agreement when president obama visits brussels on march 26 . 
  but in talks here this week , they made little headway . 
   to take one example , when announcing the trade talks last year , leaders said that the agreement would seek to * `` eliminate all tariffs '' * on trade in goods between the united states and the european union , as a step toward creating the world 's biggest bilateral trade zone . 
  but this week , american negotiators accused europe of seeking to exclude beef , chicken and pork products from tariff cuts . 
   what 's more , europe , at least , set out an ambitious timetable to get a deal done by 2015 . . that may prove difficult . 
   politicians in london and madrid can jump up and down until they are green in the face , that wo n't change anything . 
  politicians in london and madrid are going to be the ones who have to approve new members to the european union . 
  scotland and catalonia do n't join automatically upon independence . 
  and i 'm not here to argue what they * might * do or will * probably * do , i 'm just pointing out that it 's foolish to say they wo n't or ca n't change anything when it comes to either region 's accession into the eu upon independence . 
   now being represented in our media as an irrefutable , official position of the european union on the matter . 
  maybe that 's the point of the move ? 
  to give credence to it without actually giving credence to it ? 
  when it 's at the point of a gun and at the behest of a foreign invasion , ** yes . 
  ** when it 's underdone during a chaotic national transition , motivated by the greed and hunger of foreign powers , ** yes ** . 
  and what about the alsace-lorraine region ( s ) ? 
  you would ignore that being annexed into western germany during the transition between the fourth and fifth republics ? 
  you would justify such appeasement with legislature that approves it at gun-point and a referendum that 's designed to be purposefully confusing ? 
  and how far should self-determination go ? 
  if marseilles wants to secede because of financial reasons , should that be allowed ? 
  a small , mountain town of a couple hundred people ? 
  the [ single-person commune of rochefourchat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rochefourchat ) ? 
  ** edit : ** and keep in mind , all that would be happening during the chaotic transitional period between the fourth & fifth republics . 
  how can mexico invade the southwest when they 've been there for centuries ? 
  how can the united states invade germany or japan when they 've been there for decades ? 
  ** it 's still an invasion . 
  ** texas used to be apart of mexico , but if mexican soldiers invaded the united states , garrisoned the state and annexed it into the mexico , even at the permission of the texas legislature * ( whom all have mexican troops with guns standing around them and their homes ) * , than it * still would n't be legitimate * and it would * still be a invasion of the united states * . 
  there are american bases in germany and japan , we administrated germany and japan for a very short time after the war , but it 'd * still be a invasion if we garrisoned okinawa and bavaria than annexed them into the united states * . 
  it would still be a * invasion of germany and japan * . 
  so you would n't support de gaulle in wanting those foreign armies removed and for french territorial integrity to be returned ? 
  so west germany , britain , america and italy would 've been justified in invading and annexing parts of france when de gaulle was the temporary transitional leader between the fourth and fifth french republics ? 
  you 're right , it 's justified and should be ignored with appeasement . 
  well , the pm of ukraine just met with obama and the ukrainian government just requested u.s. military aid , not to mention the fact that the u.s. is holding military exercises with the ukrainian government as we speak . 
  tell me , would it be justified if mexico deployed their military into texas , if the texan legislature allowed it ? 
  or if the french military deployed to scotland if the scottish parliament allowed it ? 
  the u.s. federal government and westminster have no say in the matter ? 
  how about your own country ? 
  what if china garrisoned french polynesia with the permission of the local legislature ? 
  does paris have no say or authority in the matter ? 
  which is why germany and other countries should 've pursued alternative pipelines to the south which would 've diversified europe 's energy resources . 
  there is absolutely ** nothing ** wrong with russia not respecting * `` western '' * democracy , but if that 's the case , people should n't use * `` western '' * democracy to justify and defend russia saying it 's more representative of such than eu . 
  you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . 
  yes , but one group is probably there with the permission of the ukrainian government and one group probably is n't . 
  guess who 's who . 
   unless ... we 're just referring to the domestic , native borne crimean men and women who are fighting a grass-roots secession ... with state-of-the-art russian equipment and professionally trained russian infantry . 
  in which case ... * shame oh shame * on those war-mongering americans ... 
  exactly . 
  russia would n't tolerate it . 
  and shame on you little boy for using racial epithets . 
  that 's very , very bad and you should apologize . 
  the polish are you neighbors and you should respect your neighbors , not call them mean names . 
  * pats on head * , 
  they ar n't my strong suits , i admit it . 
  you 're such a little cutie i love you . 
  but seriously , russia would ** never ** threaten the eastern european states or europe with gazprom . 
  [ it 's definately not like they 've done it 51 times since 1992 ] ( http://www.fni.no/doc&amp;pdf/fni-r1508.pdf ) . 
  keep it going babe i 'm gettin ' a hard on for them typin ' skillz of yours . 
  i did n't ignore your argument . 
  you said the eu green party was stalinist because it made a ** non-binding resolution ** requesting schroeder to not comment on the diplomatic situation between the two countries given his political prominence and his ties to gazprom and nordstorm , as he has a financial stake in the outcome of heated negotiations . 
  you then said ** there 's absolutely no fucking way you can compare russia as stalinist in the same context ** despite them shutting down news agencies , invading nations and annexing regions . 
  you know ... ** actually restricting speech and expression instead of merely asking someone , in a non-binding un-enforceable way , to not talk on a subject ** . 
  than you said we do n't speak the same language because you had a shitty fucking argument . 
  you were n't fucked by the us , you started it with putting the eu trade deal forward , shit blew up , and i hate to say it because it 's demeaning , but the us basically had to come in and take a lead in picking up the diplomacy side , which is really upsetting for me , because i had always assumed soft power to be the eu 's ace-in-the-hole . 
  but i ca n't take you seriously when you criticize the united states/eu for this , but than defend or deflect blame from russia for cracking down on independent news agencies and fucking * invading ukraine and annexing crimea . 
  yeah , but just calm down sweetie pie , scotland is autonomous , but not independent of the united kingdom . 
  if the united states invaded scotland , garrisoned all major military installations and population centers , and than forced a referendum with a confusing selection of options , ** than it would be illegal and unrecognized . 
  ** you catch it , cutie pie ? 
   or how about this , if germany invades kalingrad because it used to be east prussia and does all i mentioned above , russia would lose it 's shit , and rightfully so . 
  ** i 'm having a lot of fun with you . 
  ** :d i do n't know if you 're a troll ... but if you are ... by god keep it up ... i fucking love it cutie . 
   and if you 're just a russian shill ... than it 's really , really cool to meet you , and if you get a chance , can you perhaps talk to your boss about getting me a job ? 
  because i think i can do a lot better than you at doing the whole defending russia thing , because dude , you 're really bad at this and i could use the money . 
   * pats on head * fun , fun . 
   ** vienna ** : austrian authorities said today that ukrainian oligarch dmytro firtash has been placed in * `` extradition custody '' * , the first step towards a possible extradition to the united states . 
   vienna district court said that firtash , a backer of ousted president viktor yanukovych arrested in austria late wednesday on the basis of a us arrest warrant , has * `` filed an appeal against the decision '' * . 
   it added that it has set bail for firtash , 48 , at usd 173.9 million on the understanding that if he pays this and is released , he will not leave austria . 
   ** washington : ** sitting in the oval office with ukraine 's interim prime minister , arseniy yatsenyuk , us president barack obama has again declared the united states ' support for ukraine , telling reporters , * '' we will stand with ukraine and the ukrainian people in ensuring that territorial integrity and sovereignty is maintained '' * . 
   he said the us would * '' not recognize any referendum that goes forward '' * , referring to a russian-sponsored vote to be held in crimea on sunday on the region 's future .
