  hollande ai n't that bad yo . 
  :( he 's probably one of our most militarily committed and reliable allies . 
  russia was dick-deep in ukraine and it escalated even furthur by fucking ** invading ukraine ** and ** annexing crimea ** with * unmarked soldiers * . 
  that 's like ... three different escalations in one fucking move dude ... * lulz * say what you want , but you 'd have to be a damn fool not to see the obvious . 
  get over it and get with reality , your bitching and hyperbole-laced lies are cute though . 
  poland gets it 's gas from nordstream after it forks off . 
  that means that russia can economically isolate not only poland , but ukraine , the czech republic and slovakia too . 
  it can shut down gas to them without shutting off gas to germany and the rest of europe , thus dividing you and making you weaker by proxy . 
  can you really be this foolish ? 
  can you really be this short-sighted and selfish ? 
  i mean ... fuck dude ... ** do you see what 's happening in crimea right now ** ? 
  are you fucking blind ? 
  how you can willingly and nonchantly strategically cripple not only your neighbors , but your fellow eu and nato members ? 
  it 's pathetic dude , your outlook is pathetic . 
  much of the gas would go from azerbaijan to georgia and then through turkey to the rest of turkey . 
  another one would 've went from georgia to the ukraine to the rest of the eu , but since crimea is out of the picture , i see no reason why they ca n't redirect along the south of the black sea or even just expand the nabucco line . 
   and there might be hiccups , but it 's more stable than russia . 
  russia whom , as we 've seen , is n't afraid to use gazprom as a political weapon , reducing europe to a * `` maybe-once-in-a-while '' * gas supply . 
  america will also become the world 's lead producer , and a major exporter , of natural gas pretty soon , with many lng ports in europe already on the drawing boards . 
   and if russia does n't like this and invades georgia and azerbaijan ? 
  well ... * lulz * ... it 's not like anybody could n't see russia 's true colors anyway . 
  yes , but even then a chinese-russian axis still could n't keep up with a american-european alliance . 
  and i ** highly doubt ** china is going to throw it 's weight behind russia with russia 's present economic state and how bad it 's foundations are shaking just at the * threat * of sanctions . 
  eh , even so , despite your earlier allegations and hopes , a chinese-russian axis * ( as your other post implied and dubbed ) * will not bring down america , especially a american-european alliance . 
  plus , just like with the sino-soviet split , i seriously do not think china will throw it 's very stability and prosperity behind russia in a blind bet , especially when russia is hemorrhaging capital at the rate it is right now . 
  no , we do , you just ca n't call a spade a spade . 
   * pats on head *, 
  do ... do you not understand how close turkey , georgia and azerbaijan are to continental europe , relatively speaking ? 
  do you not know how big russia is ? 
  ** or that the distance , in pipelines , between those countries and russia is actually shorter ** . 
  seriously ... [ look where russia 's largest natural gas field is on a map ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urengoy_gas_field ) . 
  look where it 's [ second largest natural gas field is . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urengoy_gas_field ) . 
  you do n't got to be a genius to see which one would be shorter , those or azerbaijan . 
  seriously dude ... it 's kinda disrespectful you do n't even know the geography of russia ... disappointing almost ... shit ... almost as disappointing as your lack of understanding in international geography ... * pats on head *, 
  no , they would n't be . 
  that 's stupid . 
  and i want you to give me a source on lenta saying that , just to validate your argument , but even if they did say such things , they did not deserve what they got , and it 'd be illegal to do such in america . 
  it 's authoritarian and stalinist to do something like that . 
   if that 's what you support , than just admit to being a authoritarian stalinist . 
  that 's all you have to do . 
   if that was the case , than rush limbaugh , westboro church and glen beck would all be locked up and censored . 
  russia today would be censored and it 's producers locked up in america if the scenario you were posting was factual . 
  and the goverment sure as fuck ca n't replace the editor , even if they were n't turning a profit . 
  i do n't know why any country which respects freedom of speech and expression , and the very ideals that western democracy is based on , would allow that . 
  i guess russia just does n't respect western democracy , let along the inherent and inalienable rights of the citizenry that go with it . 
  no , i believe that [ europe has a number of other non-russian energy options that are just as efficient ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_gas_corridor ) . 
   i know it 's hard to understand if you only have a degree in russian history , but the world 's a lot bigger than russia , and there are plenty of other bountiful places to get your resources , close-by , and with pipelines going through allied nato/eu members as well . 
  i agree , it was a wise move on the part of the ukrainians not to open up fire and give russia reason to invade the rest of the country . 
  and ukraine 's not in nato , so it 's not technically appeasement , and as long as we keep up the soft power pressure i do n't think it 'll be * de facto * appeasement either . 
  ** ... ** it was n't a attempt to silence somebody in the sense you 're implying it . 
  it was a non-binding resolution expressing the opinion of the green party , and if it had passed , the opinion of the european parliament , not a law which could 've been enforced . 
  and you can absolutely compare russia by the same yardstick ... since the thing you 're referencing ... stalinlism ... was based out of russia and is a integral part of russian history . 
  plus putin did what he had to do to ensure his own oligarchs and oil profiteers were in power . 
  do n't misconstruct it , just look through the portfolios of some leading russian cabinet members and united russia party members . 
  an , in my opinion , that is even more stalinist . 
  so , like i said , taking russia 's actions into account , are they stalinist ? 
  or are you saying that the ep green party is more of a stalinist construction than putin 's government ? 
  i 'd argue that yugoslavia is the best example of why hesitation and inaction is so critical . 
  the balkans spiraled out of control while europe sat on the side-lines and only committed itself to token actions ... well ... that was the case up until srebrinca ... at which point the eu actually got serious and the united states got involved ... . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's a saying in every country , in one form or another . 
  hence why there 's a good chance these economic sanctions might actually be effective . 
  and now , my friends , we are officially in the ** cold war 2.0 ** . 
  an to think i thought it was going to be with china this time around ... huh ... i 'll give it to romney , dude was right , but i 'm still confident in obama 's leadership . 
  but anyway ... [ everybody ] ( http://cdnl.complex.com/mp/620/400/80/0/bb/1/ffffff/4d1271f368da8887063e2d3234d2df04/images_/assets/channel_images/pop_culture/2013/04/24-ways-jurassic-park-defined-your-childhood/butts_532815.gif ) ... 
  i do n't know what 's worse , that i laughed , or that this poor dude 's country is being carved apart while under the constant threat of russian military invasion ... well ... a * bigger * russia military invasion ... 
  yeah , a absolutely huge step would be the establishment of a permanent franco-british brigade , given that france has all but ditched the franco-german brigade for greater military cooperation with the united kingdom . 
  yeah , it fell-apart on the german side , so the french kinda just said * `` fuck it . 
  '' * and moved towards [ greater military integration/cooperation with the united kingdom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lancaster_house_treaties ) . 
  which makes more sense to me , as both countries are basically the only two in the european union with actual power projection and a somewhat common foreign policy * ( even if it differs strongly on certain points , it 's still much more coherent than french/german foreign policy ) * . 
  the franco-german brigade still exists , but it 's a shell of what it was and a pipe dream of what it wanted to be . 
  begrudgingly agreed , and i apologize for not being more knowledgeable about the memorandum . 
  no , but i can guarantee you a lot more effort is going to be put into it because of it , and a lot more commitment is going to be given towards integration . 
   * `` the european parliament regrets statements made by former german chancellor gerhard schr\u00f6der about the crisis in ukraine , '' * the paper reads , * `` and suggests he should make no public statements about russia because his relationship with gazprom , a company that is one of russia 's most important foreign policy instruments , creates a clear conflict of interest . 
  '' * i apologize , you are correct , it would 've been a non-binding official request had it passed . 
  an i mean ... i do n't like it , but it 's not stalinist , nor are they even censoring him . 
  plus , it was rejected anyway rejected it in a 208-167 vote . 
  though you did n't answer my other question : do you consider the blacklisting kasparov.ru , grani.ru and ej.ru by putin 's goverment ; or the de facto take over of one of the few major independent news broadcasters left in russia , lenta , as stalinist ? 
  the united states is in the perfect position to exert significant soft power over russia . 
  it is the world 's largest economy in the world , and arguably the most dynamic and influential overall * ( even compared to the european union as a whole ) * . 
  this is exemplified by the fact that the 2008 financial crisis brought the entire developed world * ( including russia ) * into a recession , and caught the growth of developing countries * ( i.e. 
  china ) * in half , if it did n't drag them into recession as well . 
  russia had -7.8 % compared to america 's -3.1 % . 
  compare this to the eurocrisis , which despite plunging the entire european union into a double-dip recession * ( which it only exited last august ) * , neither russia nor the united states were forced into a double-dip recession because of it . 
  yes , the european union is * extremely powerful * when it comes to soft power , but do n't for a second think the united states is n't or is insignificant in the regard . 
  also decisive use of soft power would 've been targeting the ukrainian government and the ukranian/russian oligarchs supporting yanukovych during the crisis . 
  but instead , it did n't , it showed hesitation , inaction and unwillingness , which in my opinion , showed weakness , which gave russia , in my opinion , the confidence needed to invade ukraine and seize crimea . 
  now , finally , the european union has pieced together some kind of coherent foreign policy , but even now there are protests about the sanctions and how they 'll do more harm than good . 
  ** tl ; dr slow and steady is n't always the best approach to fast-unfolding crises . 
  so you admit that german interests supersede that of both european union and nato ? 
  and that the economic isolation of poland , the czech republic and slovakia was worth it ? 
  along with putting sweden , and other countries whom 's exclusive economic zones the gasline passes through , at a security risk ? 
  since now the russian navy has both the motivation and justification to send warships into those eezs to uphold * `` ecological safety '' * ? 
  [ ** why is this more in germany 's interests than the plethora of other projects available that supply gas from the south ? 
  ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_gas_corridor ) you know ... pipelines that mainly travel through fellow eu and nato members ... and whom 's gas originates from the relatively neutral * ( in comparison to russia ) * country of azerbaijan ? 
  i think you 've confused a opinion/unofficial request with a law/legislative bill . 
  as well as a totalitarian one-party state with a tendency for genocide , suppression of inherent rights and a cult of personality from more than half-a-century ago with a modern-day political party that 's main sticking points are environmental protection and increased european integration . 
  that said , it 's odd i do n't see you in other threads saying that russia has been taken over by stalinists after it blacklisted kasparov.ru , grani.ru and ej.ru ; or after it 's * de facto * take over of one of the few major independent news broadcasters left in russia , lenta . 
  ** why is this ? 
  ** tl ; dr yep , giving russian warships the motivation and justification to enter sweden 's economic zone , potential use of the pipeline for espionage purposes , and economically isolating poland , the czech republic and slovakia from the rest of the european union and nato is a great idea ** yeah , it was paid for by the country which just invaded ukraine , annexed crimea and whom is now poised to be on the brink of economic war with the european union and america . 
  increasing natural gas dependence on russia was a * great idea * .
