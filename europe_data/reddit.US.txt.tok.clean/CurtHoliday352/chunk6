  oh , and we did n't try to sabotage it via sweden , as sweden had it 's own legitimate security concerns , contending that the pipeline would motivate a russian navy presence in the swedish economic zone and could potentially use it for military intelligence . 
  this was backed up by the fact that [ putin said that the ecological safety of the pipeline project will be ensured by using the baltic fleet of the russian navy ] ( http://www.redorbit.com/news/business/707474/russian_navy_to_ensure_nord_stream_ecology__putin/index.html/ ) and that [ the fibre optic cable and repeater stations along the pipeline could theoretically be used for espionage . 
  ] ( http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/schroeders-pipeline-spionagekanal-in-der-ostsee-611094.html ) not to mention the fact that this [ isolates poland , ukraine and other eastern european countries * ( slovakia , czech republic , belarus ) * from western europe ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/thf_media/2006/pdf/bg1980.pdf ) . 
  so now if russia wants to cut off the flow to any of them , they do n't have to cut off gas to the rest of western europe . 
  as i mentioned above , this [ isolates these countries economically from the rest of europe , and in member-state situations , the rest of the european union and nato . 
  ] ( http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2679905,00.html ) but i mean ... [ thank god russia has never used gazprom as a political weapon before ] ( http://www.fni.no/doc&amp;pdf/fni-r1508.pdf ) ... like i said : ** brilliant move . 
  ** who said anything about decisive military action ? 
  ** i was referring to soft power being used decisively . 
  in my opinion , the european union 's hesitation , it 's disorganization and it 's unwillingness to act in the ukraine crisis is what directly led to russia feeling confident enough to go knocking down crimea 's door . 
  it literally took a russian invasion and annexation of crimea for the european union to scrap together some kind of cohesive foreign policy , and even than , ** america is still the one leading the charge ** , even in soft power , the area in which the eu is supposed to reign supreme in . 
  emphasis . 
  figure out why i put it on that . 
  i 'm the one being emo ? 
  ** lulz ** you 're the one who 's constantly bitching and throwing around personal insults , all while whining * `` you just do n't understand !!!, 
  you'lll neever understannnd !!, 
   * vicenza , italy * -- atlas vision is canceled . 
  but rapid trident is still a go . 
   the status of two annual u.s. army europe military exercises that were scheduled for july -- one in russia , one in western ukraine -- is being affected differently by the situation in ukraine , which has been described as the worst crisis since the end of the cold war . 
  the fact that the u.s. and its allies chose to go ahead with an exercise in ukraine while canceling the one in russia demonstrates western support for kiev in its confrontation with moscow . 
  i do n't think many people are saying a military option should be * anywhere near the table * in response to crimea , but the very points you make are the same reasons as to why the united kingdom needs to be more involved and more willing to go after russia with soft power . 
  the united kingdom is in the perfect position , along with france , to actually convince the other european nations to up military spending and take a more active part in foreign policy , both in the areas of soft & hard power . 
  if anybody is going to wake the eu up and get things going in the right direction as far as the military and foreign policy goes , it 's going to be france and the united kingdom , and only if they work together . 
  bah , your country should be more heavily involved in the situation and more willing to move against russia . 
  bottom line . 
  and it should be using it 's position in the european union to convince the organization to do something . 
  by signing the budapest memorandum , you signified your will to aid ukraine in maintaining it 's territorial integrity and sovereignty . 
  the language is broad enough to allow that . 
  the united kingdom has a integral role to play in this as not only one of the primary pillars of the european union , but as a member of the united nations security council . 
   the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate united nations security council action to provide assistance to ukraine , as a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , if ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used . 
  ------------------------------------------------------------  the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland will consult in the event a situation arises which raises a question concerning these commitments . 
  so yes , the united kingdom is supposed to * `` guarantee '' * ukraine 's territorial integrity . 
  * `` guarantee '' * does n't necessarily mean militarily intervention , but it does mean that it 's supposed to be doing everything it can to uphold ukraine 's territorial integrity . 
  how is that less democratic than germany 's legislature ? 
  if you 're in a federal or confederate system , you ** need ** to balance the larger and smaller states . 
  it 's the very foundation which a federation or confederacy is based upon . 
   [ the memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear-powers , the russian federation , the united states of america , and ** the united kingdom ** . 
  ] ( http://www.cfr.org/arms-control-disarmament-and-nonproliferation/budapest-memorandums-security-assurances-1994/p32484 ) ----------------------------------------------------------  [ the memorandum included security assurances against threats or use of force against the ** territorial integrity or political independence of ukraine ** as well as those of belarus and kazakhstan . 
  ] ( http://www.cfr.org/arms-control-disarmament-and-nonproliferation/budapest-memorandums-security-assurances-1994/p32484 ) -----------------------------------------------------  [ under the political agreement , ** the signatories offered ukraine `` security assurances '' in exchange for its adhesion to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
  ** the memorandum bundled together a set of assurances that ukraine already held from the conference on security and co-operation in europe ( csce ) final act , united nations charter and non-proliferation treaty .

  you can understand my writing style , it is not incomprehensible . 
  you do not have the reading comprehension of a child . 
  ** and once again with the personal attacks . 
  ** * lulz * and i am bettering myself , if you 're going to bring up stuff i told you , you might as well include * all * i 've told you . 
   but this is your mo. 
  you have a conversation , ca n't uphold your side of the argument , and you resort to childish personal attacks to distract from the main point . 
  it 's what you 've done in every conversation we 've had . 
   ( i do n't know what triggered your reaction about nuclear disarmament . 
  nothing in leondz ' comment blamed the us for wanting to reduce nuclear weapons . ), 
  which i apologized for , but from this :  in fairness , i ca n't imagine the eu having a place at this meeting . 
  the us promised to protect ukraine in exchange for nuclear disarmament , and now the promise is being tested . 
  what this has to do with the eu , is nothing . 
  i had falsely assumed that he was implying the united states was wrong for doing so and that the eu was lucky for not being involved . 
  i apologized for this assumption . 
  [ the budapest memorandum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) . 
  they should n't just be more involved , they should be leading the charge . 
  i do take pride in the influence and power our country wields , but i feel things like this are distracting us from other more pertinent matters , like our * `` pivot to the pacific/asia '' * . 
  ukraine is important , but it 's more important to the interests of the eu than it is to us . 
  and yes , they absolutely did drop the ball . 
  and as i said elsewhere in this thread , that was said specifically in relation to the european union 's indecision and inaction . 
  hence why right after she says that , she says the united states should be moving to cooperate with the united nations on ukraine more instead of the eu . 
  do n't forget the context . 
  and that 's probably why it 's not at these talks either . 
  the united states did n't handicap the eu , the eu handicapped itself . 
   through that , no chinese , russians or americans would ever have a means of coercing the eu into anything . 
  i. . . [ i think ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/capitalizing-on-the-euro-crisis-china-expands-its-influence-in-europe-a-734323.html ) [ recent history ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/world/europe/07gazprom.html?pagewanted=all ) [ proves you wrong ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=history-proves-us-influence-on-eu-2010-11-19 ) ... 
  agreed . 
  my apologies if i had mischaracterized you . 
  i am legitimately sorry . 
  i had erroneously assumed that you were implying the united states was making a mistake in pursuing and signing the budapest memorandum in cooperation with russia . 
   the eu guarantees stability just not regionally . 
   keeps its member states in line luxembourg just single-handily stopped legislation to combat tax evasion . 
  and a number of eu countries still participated in iraq * ( with uk being accused of torture and poland hosting cia black sites ) * . 
  and a number of them have been implicated in dragnet surveillance in cooperation with the united states * ( germany , uk , the netherlands ) * or independent of the united states * ( france ) * . 
   does not ( have the power to ) interfere excessively in other countries affairs . 
  even when a strong , decisive intervention is needed during a crisis to keep stability and hold off further suffering ; as well as to stop a slide into prolonged stagnation . 
  the eurocrisis is the prime example of this . 
  my post was not hard to understand . 
  you understood it perfectly . 
  i refuse to believe you have the reading comprehension of a elementary school student . 
  you 're side-stepping the issue and resorting to personal attacks , like you always do , instead of focusing on the issue at hand . 
  but please , continue to close your eyes and stick your fingers in your ears . 
  yeah , it 's so bad , remember when obama replaced the management of fox news like putin replaced the management of lenta ? 
  or that time we black-listed a bunch of right-wing blogs and websites like glenn beck and rush limbaugh ? 
  or put a guy in charge at facebook ? 
  which would be understandable if the united states lacked a strong , centralized government , with both california and new york constantly arguing with each other over the best course of action * ( while keeping in mind that both california and new york each have separate militaries and different overall foreign policies ) * . 
  oh , also understandable if the united kingdom paid most of nato 's budget and the united states needed the uk 's help if it wanted to launch a bombing campaign in cuba * ( i.e. 
  libya ) * . 
  or more like the european union loosing greece or portugal * ( and we all remember the political shitstorm that the threat of a grexit bought about ) * . 
  well ... you know ... it is a crisis directly on the border of the european union ... and the whole thing did erupt over the prospect of a eu trade deal and the previous government 's refusal to sign it ... so you know ... there 's that ... and there 's the fact that the uk was also a country which signed that treaty and said it would guarantee ukraine 's territorial integrity ... with france and china also giving assurances later on ... 
   it 's ** only one of a few ** warm-water ports that russia has, 
  * `` fuck the eu '' * for not doing anything and refusing to act decisively . 
  that was the context of the quote . 
   which is exactly why they 're not at these negotiations . 
  and this has everything to do with the eu , the whole god damn thing started because of the prospect of a trade deal with the eu , so do n't pull that bullshit dude . 
  oh , and yeah , blame the united states for wanting to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world in peaceful cooperation with russia * ( you know ... back when one of the world 's largest nuclear arsenals was suddenly fractured and spread among a bunch of different people ) * . 
  what a horrible decision . 
  oh , and if you forgot , the united kingdom is also a original guaranteer of that treaty * ( with france & china also giving statements of assurance as well ) * . 
   but ey , it 's kinda weird , even after all that shit , it 's still the united states which ukraine is turning to the most , not the european union . 
   they 're not only not off the table they 're already in force , i 'm certain that if russia fixes the referendum or does something like go further into ukraine they will be expanded and deepened .
