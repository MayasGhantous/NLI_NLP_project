  were you unaware of their implementation ? 
  no , they have not been implemented and have not gone into effect yet . 
  nor did i have ever even hint towards the notion that no action was being taken , i just said that inaction * ( directed towards those who believe it the best course , such as those in the schroeder camp ) * as being unwise . 
  but even now , the economic sanctions are limited , and while not appeasement * ( nor have i stated these moves were appeasement ) * , they should be expanded . 
  but the level of inaction and number of european countries arguing against it * ( germany and britain chief among them ) * was pretty god damn strong before russia rolled into crimea . 
  perhaps russia would 've been a little more hesitant if it thought the european union was a little more serious about utilizing it 's soft power and taking concrete steps against ukraine 's previous government and russia 's involvement in the issue ; but we 'll never know , now will we ? 
   no it is n't , not going full bore with maximum sanctions and/or immediate military action at the earliest opportunity is ** not ** appeasement . 
  by that logic , * all * negotiation is appeasement since you 're giving something up in order to come to a resolution - there is no scenario where russia simply ups and leaves without gaining an inch so we need to stop pretending that possibility exists . 
  all negotiation are not appeasement , but wanting negotiations that are undertaken with the already agreed upon goal of changing nothing * ( with the exception of angry letter writing ) * ** is appeasement ** . 
  i mean britain and france condemned germany annexing czechoslovakia , but them not doing anything after negotiating with germany is still considered the prime example of appeasement . 
  and no , there is no chance of that happening , which is why when you go into negotiations you try to make sure the other guy leaves with as little as possible and you leave with as much as possible . 
  i do n't think the best way to achieve that is with appeasement or limited sanctions . 
   well ; he has a point , after the breakup of the soviet union we did promise not to expand nato to the point where russia felt surrounded and yet we 've done just that , it 's worth looking at it from their perspective , if putin had somehow regained the baltic states , finland and ukraine etc. 
  into a eurasian union and started creeping closer and closer to our borders with a military pact we 'd probably be shitting ourselves , it 's silly to pretend that it 's okay for us to do it instead because we 're the good guys . 
  ** than why do you villianize and condemn appeasement when you understand , and it would appear , even agree with , the principles behind it in this specific scenario ? 
  ** and you misrepresent me . 
  i mean ... sure ... i think * we do * have the moral upper-hand in this situation , and i believe * we do * have a more democratic , open and transparent in comparison to russia , but that said : it 's not okay mainly because we 're the good guys * ( a childish label i dispute ) * , it 's okay because it 's in our interests . 
  russia would do the same because it 's in their interests , and the european union would be shitting itself because it 's not in their interests and threat to their safety . 
  so , guess what ? 
  the shit 's in russia 's backyard , not ours , and that 's , for all intents and purposes , a good thing . 
  and that 's because , at the end of the day , realpolitik rules the scene in international politics . 
  honestly , you know what i believe ? 
  do you know what i think would make for a more stable and prosperous russia ? 
  a more federalized european union ? 
  a more balanced international community ? 
  if ukraine and the baltic states * ( with the exception of finland ) * ** did ** go with russia ' eurasian union . 
  of course , this would be to the determinant of the people of those countries , who still have painful memories of the last time they were in a supranational club with russia , so they would never accept it , but hey , that 's my view . 
  and since the people in those countries do n't want it , what i think would work the best in the bigger picture and what putin wants does n't really mean shit ... well ... unless you 're crimea . 
  but i do enjoy the national american pastime of making life difficult for the russian government , and i do know that russia having to deal with shit in it 's own backyard makes it * a lot more difficult * for them to start shit in * our backyard * . 
  kinda a big fuck-you to putin for syria and snowden * ( whom 's revelation of domestic warrantless wiretapping & dragnet surveillance i consider a hero for , but whom 's revelation of all the legitimate spying i consider a traitor for ) * . 
   russia does n't need crimea for a port , they have 2 other deep water ports they could use and are using atm as well . 
  russia wants crimea . 
  i have to disagree strongly with you on this point . 
  russia absolutely * does need * crimea as a port . 
  [ it 's only one of a few warm-water ports that russia has which it can operate in a year-round fashion without hassle ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/warm-water-port.htm ) . 
  even st. petersburg and vladivostok freeze over at times , with the port in vladivostok having to be kept open with ice breakers * ( not sure about russian naval bases in kalingrad ) * . 
  one of the few other warm-water ports * ( if not the only other one ) * ? 
  it 's in syria . 
  and it 's pretty clear , given putin 's support of assad , just how far russia will go to maintain and expand it 's network of deep-water ports , especially the coveted warm-water ports , many of which , as pointed out above , * ar n't even in russia * . 
  well ... shit ... * that was the case * until recently . 
  oddly enough , the entire norwegian-swedish community is centered on a section of norway 's coast that is directly adjacent to the country 's largest oil reserves . 
  do n't get me wrong , i sure as fuck do n't want to see a war break-out , as a nuclear winter is n't the best way to spend your christmas . 
  and shit , i barely want to see economic sanctions , given the adverse effect it 'd have on the russian citizenry . 
  but i 'm also hearing a lot of people say that economic sanctions are unfeasible , as they 'd hurt europe by proxy . 
  so if economic sanctions are off the table , and military options are off the table , what is there besides empty talk and rhetoric ? 
  is that not appeasement ? 
  or at least * de facto * appeasement ? 
  than you have people in the schr\u00f6der , who represent * real * appeasement in every form of the word , saying the west should do nothing , not even write angry letters , and concede ukraine to russia 's sphere of influence because of the dangers of pushing a hungry bear into a corner . 
  * appeasement * + / = * diplomacy *, 
   it was essentially a transition from a one-party state to dictatorship , whereas the reichstag fire was used by hitler to transition from democracy to a one party-state . 
  * lulz * was n't that the ** exact point ** i made ? 
  i got some minor things wrong , but my primary point was correct . 
   * warsaw * - the united states will signal its resolve to protect its nato allies near russia 's borders on tuesday with the start of the first joint military training exercises in the region since the kremlin intervened in ukraine . 
   in the black sea , across the water from the crimean peninsula where russian military groups have seized control from ukrainian authorities , a us navy destroyer will take part in maneuvers with romanian and bulgarian warships . 
   to the north in poland , us fighter jets are arriving at the central lask air base to take part in joint exercises , with poland 's president expected to review the maneuvers . 
  just for all you headline readers out there , this is n't a blanket sanctions bill , and it 's specifically targeting certain people :  * ( reuters ) * - a u.s. senate panel on wednesday approved legislation that would impose strict sanctions on russians involved in moscow 's intervention in ukraine , provide aid to the new government in kiev , and implement reforms of the international monetary fund . 
  ----------------------------------------------------  among other things , the legislation would impose sanctions on russians and ukrainians judged to be involved in violence or human rights violations during anti-government protests in ukraine that began late last year , as well as against anyone involved in undermining ukraine 's security and stability . 
   the legislation also directs u.s. authorities to help ukraine 's new government investigate acts of corruption and return assets to kiev . 
  it did not target russian corporations or banks , as some lawmakers had suggested after russian president vladimir putin sent troops into ukraine 's crimea region . 
  ----------------------------------------------------------  the sanctions would include freezing assets held in the united states , travel bans and denying visas . 
   the measure also provides $ 50 million in democracy , governance and civil society assistance for ukraine and $ 100 million for enhanced security cooperation for ukraine and other countries in central and eastern europe . 
   it authorizes $ 1 billion in loan guarantees , in addition to millions of dollars in aid . 
  yes , but if i understand this correctly , even by violating that , it still allowed/justified the united states and britain to move in in opposition to guarantee ukraine 's territorial integrity . 
  but by saying that the entire treaty itself is null and void because of ukraine leaving the ussr * `` illegitimately '' * then the united states and great britain have no room to maneuver in aiding ukraine militarily * ( such as garrisoning troops across the country , with the exception of crimea , to deter any further russian chipping away of ukrainian territory ) * . 
  i mean ... at the end of the day , might makes right in international politics , so if the us/uk want to move they 're going to move , but these semantics are * very important * for propaganda and keeping the home front passive/supportive by giving justification * ( and ... you know ... saving face on the whole being the one to break the treaty ) * . 
  ** note : though i could be * ( and chances are am ) * completely wrong on this too ; not really sure , maybe somebody more knowledgeable can chime in . 
  how do you have moral qualms over denmark 's relationship with greenland when your own country 's relationship with the sami people is taken into context ? 
  ha , i knew vlad would find a way to weasel out of the budapest memorandum somehow . 
  funny considering that russia confirmed it as late as 2009 though . 
  * lulz *, 
  how so ? 
  did the riechstag fire not give the cover of chaos needed for the nazi party to seize power * ( real authoritarian power , not the figurative power that hitler held as chancellor ) * ? 
  did the night of the long knives not solidify that power ? 
  iirc , hitler did n't become truly popular until a good little time after his seizure of power . 
  it is . 
   i 'm sorry , but that is complete bullshit . 
  russia does n't want ucraine to be russia , it wants ucraine to be a buffer between it and the western countries . 
  it wants to look strong . 
  ukraine has no chance in direct warfare with russia , but there 's a whole slew of problems arising from russia attacking ukraine , international treaties kicking into place and the various interests of other countries in the area . 
  no , it 's not complete bullshit . 
  i 'm not saying russia * will * invade , but i am saying it is a * very real * possibility . 
  and i never said russia wants ukraine * in * russia , but i do contend that russia needs ukraine * in * the eurasian union if it 's actually going to become a viable , influential and competitive institution * ( instead of cis .2 ) * . 
  i think you underestimate just how important ukraine is to russia 's sphere-of-influence . 
  let me put it like this , if russia does n't convince ukraine to join the eurasian union , it ai n't shit in the coming world . 
  we 're going into a * `` asian century '' * , as many have dubbed it , a multi-polar world , dominated by the united states , the european union * ( possibly if it integrates ) * , russia * ( possibly if it 's eurasian union gets off the ground ) * and china , with brazil , india and possibly south africa coming up from behind . 
  russia just does n't ** want ** ukraine , it ** needs ** ukraine . 
  it 's need 's it 's economic strength , it population , if it wants to compete with other global great powers in the future . 
  kazakhstan and belarus ar n't going to be able to carry russia to greatness alone , and do n't think for a second russia does n't realize this , hence why they 're pushing so hard to influence ukraine . 
   also , ukraine has a population of around 45 million . 
  georgia was 4.5 million , finland is in the same area . 
  ukraine is 10 times as big . 
  it is a big country and it is not possible for russia to seize it by force and keep it so . 
  russia would n't even want that . 
  they only want it under their control . 
  with half the country possibly vulnerable to russian agents working with local opposition , and half the population possibly passive about any russian intervention * ( hell , who says that up to a 1/10th of the population wo n't actually support it ? ) * . 
  and you act like it 's a impossibility ... but ugh ... [ maybe you should read this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_ukraine ) . 
  this would n't be the first time russia has invaded and occupied ukraine , since ** the last time russia stayed for 220 years ** . 
   no , your fantasies of all-out warfare will not come to life , i 'm sorry . 
  russia will rig the referendum ( yes they will rig them , because who in their right mind would want to be a part of russia , really now ) and keep crimeea as a part of russia - crimeea never should have left russia in the first place . 
  ukraine will have payed for its independence from moscow with a piece of it .
