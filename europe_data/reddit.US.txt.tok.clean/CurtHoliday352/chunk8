  it will somehow learn to live with a spiteful neighbor and hopefully not fall pray to nationalists and rusofobia . 
  russia will get international sanctions . 
  crimea did n't leave russia , russia gave crimea to ukraine . 
  and it 's funny , because ukraine was apart of russia for half-a-century longer than crimea was apart of russia , since russia had conquered it from turkey . 
  and * stop putting words in my mouth * . 
  ** i do n't want no fucking war ** , i do n't even want sanctions , but i 'm not stupid enough to think neither is a possibility nor a necessity , respectfully , at times . 
  the ones that suffer the most are the innocent civilians on both sides , not the soldiers fighting the war or the politicians directing it . 
  in wars , entire houses with families in them can be misidentified and blown-up , kids can be hit by a stray bullet on the way to school ; in peace , economic sanctions can lead to you loosing everything you own , to being unable to acquire or afford medicine for your daughter or mother which they desperately need * ( because you ca n't cut off a government 's revenue stream without crippling an economy , and you ca n't cripple a economy without disenfranchising the population ) * . 
  it 's fucked up , and it should n't happen , but it happens for a reason , and at times those reasons are justified and necessary in international relations . 
  simple as that . 
  it 's fucked up , but at times it 's needed . 
   no other country on this green earth will ever relinquish their nuclear weapons . 
  no , which is probably one of the most fucked up things to come out of this situation . 
  it 's the same in the united states . 
  the only difference being , since you have a unicameral legislature , the parliament i guess both impeaches , tries and convicts * ( so i guess 1 vote ? ) * . 
  in america , the house of representatives * ( lower house ) * impeaches a official , and the senate * ( upper house ) * tries and convicts the impeached official * ( 2/3rds majority are needed for a conviction ) * . 
  it 's not / r/europeans , it 's / r/europe ... and it 's on a website hosted by a american company , with servers located in america and with a user-base that is majority american . 
   but if you want to make a counter to my original point , be my guest  though , as far as europe goes during the cold war ... i do n't remember america doing much invading there ... but i do recall the soviet union having some pretty interesting adventures in czechoslovakia and hungary . 
  :d and ... i do remember america garrisoning the fulda gap in germany ... . and being drastically outnumbered by the soviet opposition ; if i recall it was mostly a defensive force meant to delay and hold , unlike the soviet army which [ routinely planned for offensive operations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seven_days_to_the_river_rhine ) . 
  yes , because as the economic well-being of eastern europe and eastern germany have shown , or as the political state of belarus and kazakhstan has shown , that 's * always * a great idea . 
  ukraine is fucked . 
  especially since it does n't have nuclear weapons up it 's sleeve * ( which means even if they did manage to , which is the slimmest fucking chance in the world , take back crimea from russia , they would n't of had the nuclear trump card to stop russia from immediately launching a 2nd offensive . ) * . 
  ** hell , ukraine is fucked if russia invades in general . 
  ** the only thing ukraine can do in such a scenario is go * `` total war '' * and shit like finland in 1939 , but given the terrain and russian sympathies in eastern ukraine/crimea , there 's no chance it hell they 'll win . 
  even finland lost the winter war and had to give up some pretty strategic and valuable territory . 
  so , ukraine 's choices , * in my personal armchair opinion are * : * a. 
  * do as good as finland , but lose eastern ukraine , crimea , and possibly portions of western ukraine . 
  then try to pull a * `` vietnam '' * with west ukraine resembling north vietnam , with partisans chipping away at russia in crimea/eastern ukraine . 
  * do worse than finland , lose the entire country , but hope they can do as good as the mujahadeen in afghanistan and make the occupation too costly . 
  so yeah , as i mentioned numerous times before , ukraine is fucked completely against russia . 
  it 's either the country being torn in half and a decade or more of well-coordinated guerrilla warfare against russia * ( best-case scenario ) * , or the entire country being occupied and a decade or more of loosely-coordinated guerrilla warfare against russia * ( worst-case scenario ) * . 
  the most it can hope for is cutting it 's losses now with crimea . 
  and that depends on two things : russia 's goodwill and america 's willingness to defend them . 
  and , at the moment , it does n't look like america has * any intention * of moving militarily against russia for ukraine , so it really all depends on russia 's goodwill and whether they decide to invade or not . 
  because if they invade , ukraine is in for a real shitty , shitty time for the next decade or two ; and if they lose ? 
  well then , they could be in for a real shitty time for the next century * ( than again , maybe russia might be good to ukraine this time in contrast to the past couple centuries ? 
  though i do n't think many ukranians are going to go for that ) * . 
  ** note : all my armchair general neckbeard opinions **, 
  while true , and the one 's who suffer the most are always the innocent civilians caught in the middle of the fight , appeasement should n't be the preferable path either , in fact , it should n't even be on the table . 
  we saw what appeasement led to with hitler and neville * `` peace in our time '' * chamberlain . 
  if anything , the west should be exerting all the soft power it can muster against russia right now . 
  but even with soft power and economic sanctions , there are still innocent civilians who will be caught in the middle * ( you ca n't cripple a economy/government 's revenue stream without disenfranchising it 's population ) * . 
  but , ** overall ** , i think somebody loosing their house is preferable to it being bombed with their family in it ; or somebody not being able to get/afford medicine for their daughter * ( which is , do n't get me wrong , a tragic scenario ) * as preferable to global thermonuclear warfare which results in the end of civilization as we know it . 
   agreed : / it 'd probably be a fighting retreat doing maximal damage to the invading army and their economy and wait them to crash economically till putin forget one last time to check his glass for warfarin and one of his entourage kills him like staline . 
  i think it 'd be more like what we saw happened in crimea . 
  you move and you seize before the other guy can even react . 
  if it works , you have the entire territory and the other guy either has to accept it or mobilize for * `` total war '' * . 
  it sucks for ukraine because it has no hope of winning a conventional war against russia , it sucks for us because nobody has any hope of winning a thermonuclear war . 
  so , let 's say for example : russia invades estonia . 
  i believe , in my opinion , that the fate of estonia will be determined by who wins the opening battle * ( for the country ) * . 
  estonia 's fate will depend on how fast the united states/nato can get marines and paratroopers into there while * it 's still contested * . 
  even if it means driving a carrier taskforce through a russian submarine-infested baltic sea , because , once again i must emphasis * this is my armchair general opinion * , if estonia falls completely * ( to whomever wins the battle ) * , than the country/alliance who loses it is not going to take it back * ( or get the chance to take it back , so they 'll willingly accept defeat , so as to avoid nuclear escalation ... hopefully ) * . 
  neither russia nor the west * ( alright ... maybe russia ... crazy bastards ... but for this argument we 'll say they wo n't ) * will not want to go nuclear or conduct a first-strike over estonia . 
  an if either of us do mobilize for conventional total war over estonia , i highly doubt we 'll actually conduct total war * ( i.e. 
  huge nato armies advancing across massive swathes of europe against similar sized and positioned russian armies ) * , as i can honestly see no way which that does n't escalate into thermonuclear warfare ... which i do n't think anybody wants . 
  so , in my opinion , there wo n't be long , drawn out massive wars * ( which in this day and age , are all but guaranteed to end in nuclear holocaust , as i pointed out above ) * , but rather short , limited and decisive wars , so as to avoid nuclear escalation . 
  this is the same military doctrine which china has applied to any potential conflict in the south china sea involving the many territorial disputes it has with it 's neighbors in the region , many of whom , like nato , possess mutual defense pacts with the united states . 
  and this is why power projection and fast reaction forces * ( i.e. 
  paratroopers & marines ) * are , in my opinion , probably the most important deciding factors in modern day warfare . 
  of course ... this is the same logic that the german empire used in wwi and the japanese empire used in wwii ... both of which inevitably ended up as `` total war '' scenarios ... but fuck ... i think the point still stands , given that the introduction of nuclear weapons has completely reshaped the game as we know it ; although ... using the same strategy as the two countries which started ... * and lost * ... the first two world wars does n't bode well for this * ( hypothetical ) * war and it 's chances of not snowballing into wwiii ... but i really do n't see many other options in which two nuclear-armed states/alliances can go to war and avoid nuclear escalation ... so it 's literally the only workable scenario which does n't end in nuclear holocaust . 
  eh , i guess , still would be a absolutely * huge * drain on resources , which basically accomplishes the same thing i mentioned above with less bloodshed * ( i.e. 
  it being a nuisance not worth the time ) * . 
  and it might even cost * more resources * , given you have to maintain the blockade for a long-ass time and now the swiss have all the extra resources available to them that would 've been denied in a shooting war . 
  so it comes down too : * a. 
  * do i want to spend a very bloody and costly 1-2 years invading this small little central european country ? 
  * do i want to spend a very tiresome and costly 2-4 years sitting around and blockading this small little central european country ? 
  * c. * do i want to ignore this small little central european country and just make a shit-load of money trading/banking with them ? 
  plus , it 's a great offloading zone for this shit ton of war loot and jewish valuables i 've seized . 
  i seriously doubt we 'd ever get into a shooting war with russia over ukraine , but i agree with everything else you said . 
  any potential war would be over something like estonia or finland ; i ca n't even see us moving for moldova as long as it 's outside romania . 
  that said , to avoid thermonuclear holocaust , any war would also probably be short , limited and decisive . 
  and yeah , the black sea fleet is finished . 
  even if it is n't sunk , as it ca n't do shit if turkey closes the bosporus straits . 
  and if we do sink it , it wo n't be through submarines or anything , it 'll be through b2s and f-35s , something that can break through the russian aa defense * ( the most advanced in the entire world ) * . 
  and even then , we might ignore it and just lock down the bospherus strait , sending the b2s and f-35s to go take out the russian atlantic fleet , which is a much larger concern as it could fuck up our entire logistical network * ( which russian submarines will be doing anyway ) * . 
  an american destroyer is out there now in the black sea , but that 's for show . 
  if things popped off all the men on that ship are dead ; russia is tracking it and will saturate it with so many missiles it will cease to be an actual object in existence . 
  the whole reason it 's there is to * dare * russia to destroy it , just like when we sent that big-ass defenseless b-52 across china 's newly-declared adiz . 
  sure , it 'd be blown up easily , but it 's a * dare * to blow it up . 
  but like i said , any war between two major nuclear powers is going to be short , decisive and limited . 
  neither want to escalate beyond conventional warfare , and neither want to fight to the point it turns into * `` total war '' * , so power projection and expeditionary forces * ( like marines & paratroopers ) * are going to be key * ( in my opinion ) * . 
  the downside being europe , while having some of the most well-trained and technologically advanced militaries in the world , lacks power projection and the necessary infrastructure to use it * ( global military bases , large blue water navies , large number of refueling tankers and cargo planes ) * , and since time is the deciding factor , probably any retaliation will be coordinated between a small , tailored force from the united kingdom , france and the united states forces instead of a huge , roving nato army , and even then , there 's no time for indecision so you might just see the u.s. or like us/france or us/britain go it alone if any arguments between them pop-up , as there 'd be no time to negotiate and re-align . 
  of course , * all of this * is just my armchair general opinion and predictions . 
  ** note : ** an the f-35s ar n't even in service yet , so it may just fall to our single squadron of b2s for hitting russia 's heavily-defended * ( aa-networked ) * backyard . 
  ** note2 : ** and i really do hope war is avoided , for the sake of all the servicemen on both sides , but most importantly for the sake of the innocent civilians who will without a doubt be caught in the cross-fire . 
  :( that said , we should n't go down a road of appeasement with putin either . 
  call it what you want , but it 's a defense that worked against the third reich , when there were no developed nations around to help . 
  yes , but it does have 16,000 tanks in reserve/storage . 
  4,000 of which are t-80s . 
  i really would n't be surprised if many were re-activated specifically for this , especially given the fact that 1,200 t-72s are in active service , along with a couple hundred t-64 / t-62 / t-55 . 
  ** edit : ** plus what / u/paristetris said about them probably fucking up the count and including things like bmps , btrs and bmds as tanks . 
   ** moscow ** -- ukraine is on the verge of civil war , warned ousted president viktor yanukovich , who reemerged in the russian southern city of rostov-on-the-don to make a statement more than a week after his first news conference in russia . 
   his statement came as moscow reportedly reinforced its forces in the ukrainian region of crimea and held new military exercises . 
  in crimea , the regional parliament declared independence ahead of a referendum planned for sunday , when the peninsula 's voters are to decide whether they want to join russia . 
  ----------------------------------------------------------  the operation will involve about 4,000 troops and 36 planes , said the statement , which did n't specify the location of the exercise . 
   russia has deployed a force of 220,000 troops , 1,800 tanks and over 400 helicopters close to ukraine 's border . 
  its neighbor has about 41,000 troops , of which only 6,000 were `` really combat ready , '' ukraine 's acting defense minister igor tenyukh told the national parliament tuesday , unian news agency reported . 
   * `` this [ russian ] force by several times exceeds the armed forces of ukraine , '' * tenyukh said . 
  *** yes . 
  the situation with stephen fry was a non-legal mutual agreement .
