  you ca n't be banned from a city in the united states , especially a large one like salt lake city . 
  he can be banned from lds property or private property in general , but not from the city . 
  that 's ridiculous and would n't last a day in court , fuck , it would n't last a minute in court . 
  and if a extremist mexican politician came to america to stir up shit and support a separatist movement ? 
  ** and he 's not a citizen ? 
  ** than yeah , he can be deported or his visa revoked for whatever reason . 
  ** but if he 's a citizen ? 
  ** absolutely not . 
  hell , there are several individuals already that advocate such and are trying to put together political support for it , many of them educated university professors . 
  they call the movement * `` reconquista '' * : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reconquista_ ( mexico ) you also have movements/political parties like [ mecha ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mecha ) which is a nationalist indigenous mexican group which lays claim to their ancesteral lands in south western united states . 
  i do n't like jobbik and sure as fuck do n't like their political outlook , but i do n't agree with this move at all . 
  it completely goes against a open , democratic and transparent society . 
  freedom of speech and freedom of expression should be honored and upheld , even if you vehemently disagree with what 's being said . 
  people are going to , of course , draw comparisons with the nazis , but here 's the thing : the nazi 's were n't elected into power . 
  they burned down the reichstag and blamed the commies , then forcibly seized power in the chaos and straight up murdered anybody who said otherwise . 
  an to be completely honest , i do n't think the nazi party should 've been banned back then in germany either * ( nor do i believe they should be banned now ) * . 
  nazi germany did n't rise because the country respected free speech/free expression too much , it rose because it tore down the very foundations those ideals were based on * through force and subversion * , not * with words and expressions * . 
   it is far fetched for them . 
  if russia caught wind of ukraine pushing for nukes again they would be all over it . 
  and they 'd be supported because we all know what direction they would be fired in and because the west can hardly be seen to be aiding ukrainian nuclear weapons . 
  it would n't take much to cripple the ukrainian economy , as has been shown . 
  as for the us specifically , i think they 'd have no problem with sanctioning a nuke aiming ukraine . 
  it would even help russian relations . 
  by not being far fetched , i did n't mean them doing it is n't far fetched , i mean them being * capable * of doing it , much more easily than either iran or north korea , is n't that far fetched . 
  otherwise i agree with you . 
   the middle east is interesting because the us has less of a need for the middle east due to its forthcoming energy independence . 
  of course there 's an interest in protecting israel and its current allies , but the usa has no reason to bend over backwards for middle eastern oil anymore ( save assisting american companies in the region ) . 
  while true , the majority of the oil in the middle east , especially iraq , does n't go to america . 
  it goes to europe and china * ( an is extracted mostly by european and chinese corporations ) * , which helps keep the petrodollar afloat . 
  and even if the united states leaves completely , it still worries me . 
  iran , israel , and saudi arabia do n't have the best relations , and the region is n't the most stable in the world , throwing nuclear weapons in the mix , having a nuclear arms race in effect , would be completely destabilizing and pose a honest danger to all of us . 
  as i said , it could only take one shot for everyone to light everyone up , and even if the united states is completely out of the region , it does n't erase the shia/sunni/jewish tensions . 
  if turkey gets nukes than that adds a whole ` nother dimension . 
  it 's not the mainstream view , trust me . 
  and it 's definitely not the one prominent in congress or government . 
  i have to disagree with you . 
  i 'm a american and i support it fully . 
  i 'm actually quite proud of it . 
  and that 's my opinion . 
  they actually are neighboring russia ... artic circle and all ... 
  the quickest way to bomb america is through the artic , not over the atlantic . 
   canada would be on the front-line of any war between america and russia . 
  the molepeople of thule have seized it , framed me as a xenophobic bigot against the brothakians of shambhala , and banished me back to the mortal realms . 
  my old account remains trapped in the lands of purgatorium , the dimension between our universe and theirs , forever drifting in the lonely , cold and unforgiving darkness of timespace . 
  so ... this account will have to do until i can raise enough funds for a expedition back through the earthgate to retrieve it . 
  that 's not true , that 's not true at all . 
  [ the amount it pays is similar to italy ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8036097.stm ) , which has a gdp similar to the united kingdom . 
  with france , germany , spain and italy , the united kingdom is primary pillar in the e.u. 
  's budget . 
  and yet , until this year , france , which contributes a shit-ton to the european union * ( 2nd most after germany ) * , was able to maintain the stipulated rate of military spending . 
  italy , however , ca n't . 
  poland , the tenth largest contributor to the eu , is well on it 's way to meeting the 2 % stipulation . 
  an , despite greece 's shitty economic position , even * it * is able to maintain the stipulated amount of spending * ( even after making some pretty massive cuts too ) * . 
  i do n't believe a nuclear arms race will come out of crimea either * ( though it 's not like there is n't a fuckton of nukes still in the region from the last arms race ) * ... and i fully believe that the united states will use all the soft power in it 's arsenal to dissuade ukraine from acquiring nuclear weapons again . 
  although , while the finances , intellect and time constraints are huge , ukraine * does have experience * with nuclear weapons and has fielded them in the past , so them creating them is n't that far-fetched , as they have a much higher leg-up over countries like north korea or iran . 
  hell , to be honest , i could even see the united states agreeing to unsc resolutions against ukraine over nuclear weapons , or at the very least , simply abstaining from it , much like how china and russia turned on north korea over the issue . 
  but i admit , i really do n't know how the u.s. would react in a unsc scenario over the issue . 
  but what does worry me ? 
  the middle east and east asia . 
  those are where i think regional arms races are most susceptible , with iran and japan being the most likely , in my opinion , to set-the race off in each region respectfully . 
  that 's very , very true . 
  but i do n't think it takes away from the fact that in a crisis like this , a organization * does need a leader * to survive without significant stagnation . 
  all sides should be able to see this in the eurozone , especially when there really is n't any other viable alternative given france 's unfortunate economic state . 
  yes , but honestly , how do you think the united states is going to react when it detects nuclear launches from russia or china * ( even if it 's not aimed at us or nato ... because we might not know that yet ... we just know there 's been massive launches ) * ? 
  how do you think france and great britain are going to react when it see 's this and the united states firing off nuclear weapons ? 
  all it takes is one bullet , one isolated nuclear incident , and we 're all fucked in a nuclear winter . 
  eh , if anything he has a better understanding of the situation , because to make money on speculation , you got ta be able to see where things are going ... even if you 're making money off other people 's despair and foolishness ... 
  though it is quite interesting that when this guy talks about the eu 's economic situation people talk shit , but when gerhard schr\u00f6der talks about eu-russian relations people suck his dick . 
  which could be argued is because germany , as the most economically prosperous and powerful country in the eurozone , did n't take the necessary leadership role in leading the zone through the crisis . 
  ** tl ; dr nuclear proliferation is bad m ` kay **  it 's a great lesson for iran and others . 
  a unfortunate lesson . 
  i completely get the principle behind it , and m.a.d. 
  * ( mutually assured destruction ) * has always reigned supreme in relations between nuclear powers ... but the dynamics of the game change when more and more countries get nuclear weapons . 
  mad than becomes less of a guarantee of peace and more of a game of russian roulette * ( lulz russian ) * . 
  i mean ... let 's look at the countries in the region ... you have the pakis , the indians , the jews , the ruskies and the chinese all with nuclear weapons ... . all pointing their loaded guns at each other in a small room , all with fingers on the trigger . 
  now you 're going to throw the persians in there ? 
  who next ? 
  the turks and arabs are going to get all skitzy and shit , because now not only do the jews and russians have nuclear weapons , but now the persians do too ... so * of course * they 're going to start their own nuclear programs out of self-preservation . 
  now in this scenario , you have the turks , the arabs , the ruskies , the chinese , the pakis , the indians , the jews and the persians all in a small room ... and all with loaded guns pointed at each other . 
  ** and it only takes one bullet to fuck everyone . 
  ** even if they ar n't related to the dispute , what do you think the arabs are going to do if they see nuclear weapons being launched out of iran ? 
  even if they 're headed for israel , the saudis do n't know that , so they launch against iran , now india and pakistan see a bunch of nuclear missiles coming from fucking everywhere , so they freak out and fire nuclear weapons , now china see 's india launching nuclear weapons and freak out , so they launch nuclear weapons , russia detects this , so they launch their own nuclear weapons out of fear of a chinese attack , than turkey freaks the fuck out and launches nuclear weapons on russia , which , since they 're in nato , also leads to the united states , france and the united kingdom launching nuclear weapons . 
  ** so ... we 're all utterly fucked just because two small countries had a isolated nuclear dispute ** . 
  i do n't know what scares me more to be honest , iran 's ambitions for nuclear weapons because of united states ' encroachment , or japan 's ambitions for nuclear weapons because of the united states ' distance * ( low confidence in the american nuclear umbrella ) * . 
  both can lead to some pretty nasty fucking regional arms race , and it does n't look like either east asia nor the middle east are going to be the most tension-free regions in the next century . 
  yes , but it makes any potential military invasion * very costly * . 
  switzerland 's terrain and military preparedness * ( bunkers and airbases in mountains/vital bridges , tunnels and railroads rigged or easily capable of being blown up/large amount of the civilian population trained and possessing a military rifle even if it lacks a firing pin for most/nuclear fallout shelters in almost every home or building ) * . 
  even if they 've taken some pretty large steps in scaling back a lot of those measures since the end of the cold war , the doctrine and basics are still there , making them much more prepared and capable of defending their country than other european nations . 
  hitler hated switzerland , he called it a * `` pimple on the face of europe '' * and beyond a doubt , he could 've crushed switzerland if he truly wanted too , but he did n't , because it would 've been too costly . 
  the balkans and greece set back operation barbarossa by a season , switzerland would 've set it back by a year . 
  so unless switzerland itself is the primary target to subject and occupy * ( even though it 's a neutral country , which , for all intents and purposes , wo n't attack your rear lines and will even trade with you , as the swiss-nazi controversies attest to this day ) * , that military preparedness and ability is a ** huge ** deterrent . 
  i mean , why attack switzerland when you can just go around it ? 
  and keep trading with them the whole time ? 
  i think nazi germany trigger-finger happy ass is the best proof of this rule , and i do n't think the soviets would 've attacked switzerland for the same reason . 
  hell , when france left nato , many soviet plans actually hoped that by avoiding france and not attacking her , and simply focusing on germany and the low countries * ( along with the united kingdom ) * they could keep her out the war . 
  the logic behind that is even stronger with switzerland . 
  neutrality does not always equate military weakness or unpreparedness though , as switzerland goes to show . 
  the united kingdom is actually one of the few to have always met the 2 % of their gdp military spending stipulation of nato . 
  though their recent re-organization and it 's negative effect on their power projection is not so much deliberate as it is a result of incompetence . 
  france met the spending requirement too until this year , when it had to drop to 1.8 % because of economic difficulties and austerity , but their military commitment as evidenced by mali and car , in my opinion , excuses them .
