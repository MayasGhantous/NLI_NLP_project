poland did not have a chance of defending itself , it was being destroyed by the germans . 
  example , 7 days after the invasion , on september 8 , the german armored corps were already bordering warsaw , and it was fully encircled by 9th of september . 
  the polish abandoned pomerelia , greater poland , and upper silesia in the first week . 
  warsaw was attacked on the 9th and sieged on the 13th , and germans also reached lwow around the same time . 
  additionally the polish air force was reduced from 400 to just 54 by the 14th of september and were practically incapable of fighting the luftwaffe . 
  [ battle of bzura ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_bzura ) was a huge success for germany , with the poles suffering 220,000 + casualties with the germans only taking 12,000 + . 
  to be granted , poland did inflict heavy losses in the first few days and did well for the army inequalities , but they certainly did not have a chance of defending themselves . 
  not really anything rare , i do n't think many people want open borders , that would be a disaster , just making it easier/not any harder to immigrate . 
  break *  brake is pressing on the pedal to stop a car . 
  because almost everyone who has ebola is black ? 
  it 's not spreading throughout europe or north america , it 's spreading through west africa , where black people come from , it 's not any type of racism just really logic . 
  obviously i do n't know much about the portuguese constitution but can you show me an example ? 
  so your 1/32 spanish ? 
  they claimed that was because of legal problems . 
  what ? 
  not by next year ... 
  in these cases i really just want the admins to fuck free speech and delete that type of shit . 
  so pretty much almost the same as r/europe ? 
  i too wish death upon millions of peoe because they are an economic drain on the country . 
  source ? 
  i would n't take anything in the youtube comments seriously , it 's the same place where pro-putin shit gets liked a ton , contrary to real life opinion . 
  besides , this video is relating to the balkans so i 'm sure a bunch of super nationalist people came there just to like anything talking shit about a countr other than them . 
  youtube comments are cancer . 
  never expect anything different from youtube . 
  apparently just as much as all the other reddit memes . 
  well most people in this sub are against muslim asylum seekers , have n't seen any talk on anyone else seeking asylum really . 
  pain and suffering ? 
  are you 13 ? 
  that does n't relate to military bases . 
  haha yeah , sometimes i imagine what it would be like if we just let the south secede . 
  [ should be pretty obvious ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/biblebelt.png ), 
  wow , alabama more in favor of gay marriage than poland , that 's pretty surprising . 
  guess we ca n't complain about nazi germany because they helped us greatly in landing on the moon . 
  as the other person said , it 's mainly a few areas that are against gay marriage in the us . 
  northeast , west coast , and midwest all mostly have gay marriage laws , but the . 
  the south and somewhat the big empty states ( wyoming , montana ) are against gay marriage . 
  eh , i somewhat agree . 
  of course here in the us almost all of the abortion and stem cell protesters are christian , but obviously you can be christian and not be against science . 
  example 33 % of scientists still believe in god . 
  and it just would n't be practical to abolish religion , what 's the punishment for being religious ? 
  that would be a huge violation of human rights . 
  that 'll show those barbarians how unbarbaric the west is . 
  yes because as we all know tht worked so well in history and all religious people are all ignorant who do n't understand science !, 
  translating * literally * but i understood it well * like the other posted said , just trying to help . 
  the worst days * , 
  yes exactly , `` hey we 're all american ( not even an ethnic group ) so give us some of your independence ( we all know how iraq is literally a puppet state of the usa ) , after all it would be a shame if something bad happened ( for example spending trillions on a war to secure 5 % oil imports , wake up sheeple ! ), 
  surprised that europe is not drastically different than america . 
  marriage * , 
  so she was `` technically '' in israel , even though most of the world recognizes palestine . 
  if we go by western standards and she 's wrong though , still , why does it matter ? 
  i hear people say stupid shit everyday , i really do n't care . 
  i ca n't imagine being around you if you have to correct every minimal insignificant factual error ever made in your presence . 
  yes , as it 's clear all the recent genocides have resulted in them being invaded by the us . 
  some examples : [ sudan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_in_darfur ) [ rwanda ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rwanda ) [ bangladesh ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_bangladesh_genocide ) [ cambodia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambodian_genocide ) [ burundi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burundian_genocide ) some actual examples that have resulted in the us doing something : [ serbia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srebrenica_massacre ) as we all clearly know , the serbian government is completely being run by the us to advance american interests in harvesting the vast and bountiful resources of serbia !, 
  [ iraq ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-anfal_campaign ) another example of the us spending trillions of dollars to secure 5 % of it 's total oil imports , wake up sheeple !, 
  why the fuck does it even matter in the first place ? 
  yep , i went there when i was in france and liked it a lot better than the notre dame . 
  when you go to the top floor inside and actually get to look at all the colored glass , it 's amazing to think how they could 've done all that in only 1248 , seems impossible really . 
  that 's hilarious , it 's like a polandball caricature of the balkans in real life . 
  croatia is n't an ex eastern-bloc though . 
  forgive me if i 'm wrong , but croatia seems a lot more western than other balkan countries . 
  yeah , i mistook him and thought he was implying the us is training and arming isis . 
  i disagree with him the us wants destability in the region . 
  that 's the irish flag bud . 
  yep , the us gets only 13 % of its oil from the middle east , and about 2/3 of that is from saudi arabia , so even if this is some big plot to get oil , it 's not even a considerable amount , even if terrorism improved that somehow . 
  ok then what is the whole purpose of destabilizing the middle east then ? 
  a yes the old `` usa created isis '' argument . 
  thanks for letting me know there 's no point in debating with you . 
  except keeping nato and the eu as a whole together is in it 's interests . 
  even if it was n't the public demand for war would be insane . 
  what interest does the us have in bombing isis other than stopping them ? 
  no , it 's are since he 's talking about multiple people . 
  iceland going hard in the paint . 
  you 're probably too old to have been taught it in school , but do you know how the us/nato bombing of yugoslavia is taught ? 
  where are you moving to ? 
  i 've had thoughts about moving to uk/nordic countries before , or atleast canada . 
  yep , people forget how huge lend lease was . 
  from wiki , what america send to ussr : over 400,000 jeeps and trucks ; 12,000 armored vehicles ( including 7,000 tanks ) 11,400 aircraft and 1.75 million tons of food . 
  well i do n't know enough about the subject to be knowledgable or have an opinion , my last statement was just something i 've heard catalans say . 
  my choices are probably somewhere in africa , either northern africa or something like a kenyan safari ( typical i know . ), 
  another few interesting places for me would be between indonesia , japan , or south korea . 
  all of these places have very cool history ( i love history ) and would be an interesting culture conpared to my life . 
  well one main reason is because no one seriously wants to secede from the us . 
  at most , 20 % of texans do but in other states there 's hardly any . 
  plus all the us has basically same culture ( maybe some north/south division ) whereas catalans have a distinctive one and many feel as if it is disappearing with support from madrid . 
  possibly . 
  the one russian jew i met was still pro-russia , but of course i ca n't generalize all of them because of him . 
  maybe it 's a location difference ? 
  who knows . 
  just more ideas for us immigration , are you in a skilled job ? 
  you can get in through family if you have any , but that one does n't sound likely for you . 
  last one i can think of is getting asylum if you face fear of persecution for political opinion , but i 'm not sure if that would work in your situation . 
  the us immigration laws really do suck sometimes . 
  strange , most of the russians i 've met have still been strongly pro-russia , like putin , think russia was justified in ukraine etc. 
  maybe it 's just a matter of them being second or third generation immigrants and being disconnected from what life there is actually like ? 
  just fyi it 's `` razed '' instead of raised in that situation , 
  got a source for that one ? 
  that sounds like an insanely bullshit statistic . 
  the scottish are n't living in poverty . 
  everyone is welcome here , even the gypsies .
