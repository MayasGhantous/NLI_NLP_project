united states of greater austria, 
   i think europeans are a little but defensive about their own cultures these days , but i think that we 're very justified in doing so . 
  american culture , products and so on have spread a lot through globalisation , so much so that a lot of media created in , say , england for example , can end up having a lot of american cultural slants , despite not being from or for america . 
  on the same token , but different ( time , place , degree , and i feel more noticeable for europeans ) this is true here in the states as well . 
  i feel it has to do with the industrial revolution vs. expansionism . 
  i am curious how it has effected your culture and assume the industrial revolution would be noticeable where we can rule out expansionism compared to usa huge open lands ( shrugs ) . 
  here , to be blunt our food went to shit between wwii until the last 20 years . 
  ignore the nyers and chicago people , i said expansionism . 
  corporations with increase shelf technology for can foods , chemicals , packaging , fast food and chain restaurants changed our entire landscape . 
  meanwhile , local ranchers , farmers , butchers and restaurants owners began disappearing so crappy tv dinners , market foods and now mothers scramble to adapt recipes to boxed and canned * shit * . 
  basically : big business farms , ranches , restaurants are rising = mom and pops decrease the void was `` middle america '' getting hosed and most everywhere feeling the impact . 
  i 'll give you generational anecdotal in my family beside creme rising to top from milk from the dairy man or other stories . 
  i never had lamb till i tried indian food in my mid 20s ( 1990 ? ), 
  while in grad school . 
  i was like damn this is good and why in the hell is this my first time considering i came from rural ranching community background . 
  so , when i see my old man again i tell how awesome the lamb was and how come as kid we never ate any ? 
  so , i 'm like wtf ? 
  turns out after wwii the nylon industry changed the need of sheep for wool and thus the entire ranching industry was almost dead in an instant . 
  the usa is just so flexible/capitalistic it gives up it 's `` cultural practices '' . 
  i guess being a young nation right at the dawn of the industrial revolution has its drawbacks/perks ( shrugs ) . 
  having said all that , i feel that americans hang onto to the littlest thing that makes us individuals apart from one another ( e.g. , favorite sports teams ) . 
  i put up two links you may want to look at . 
  he/she is probably a typical anti-american that has no knowledge of our history or culture like this red hearing clap trap ( so stay calm ) . 
  so , the commenter sees and hears what they want to believe ( not to mention brits were the main creator and financial benefactors of slavery in his/her targeted geography ) . 
  \u25d4 _ \u25d4 keep in mind with my links the usa is roughly 2/3 the size of the eu if someone was to approach this with earnest statistical analysis . 
   the americans . 
  let 's not get even started how much the americans honour the confederate states . 
  including the us military itself . 
  ... [ yawn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_equestrian_statues_in_the_united_states ) ... [ zzzzz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_tallest_statues_in_the_united_states ), 
   what 's your definition of racism ? 
  i 'm not the person you are responding to but here 's the catcher ** if ** you want an honest academic response . 
  there are three definitions from memory . 
  * you recognize race exist ( so we are all racists ) * you attribute any superiority or inferiority to any race ( super common and so most all of us are racist ) * you attribute superiority to your race and inferiority to others in a hateful manner ( all to common and projected too often on reddit when the comments are hopefully meant as humor ) . 
  the latter one is obviously very dangerous because of the terrible history we all know to well of oppression , slavery and eugenics ( e.g. , sterilizations , genocide ) . 
  there has been a notable increase on reddit , imo , since the george zimmerman/trayvon martin debacle and i will explain why . 
  but first the biggest danger is reddit is open to youth and as such those minds are impressionable . 
  the plus side it creates an open discourse to talk about racism . 
  this part i am very hopeful about . 
  the first bullet point is crucial for us all to recognize for us to get over for the political bullshit but it has been politicized . 
  here in the usa the trayvon martin is a classic example with a person below you mentioning racism comes out in droves on reddit . 
  however the real racism has been the * still * demonizers of george zimmerman . 
  obviously there is crucial complexities and innuendo that blacks can * read * into what happened that night from their life experiences ** but ** there is absolutely no evidence that is the case nor is there any evidence that george zimmerman has been racist towards african americans in his life ( period ) . 
  in fact , quite the contrary and that 's why reddit is really backlashed on the case and those who blindly rally trayvon martin was the victim of racism as call for racism are actually being the `` racists '' ( e.g. , many peeps on with monthly updates during the crucial period at / r/hiphopheads ) just the same as other groups who rally and still do around george zimmerman ( e.g. , / r/trayvonmartin ) . 
  if anyone remembers when this case first hit reddit en masse was not backing george zimmerman at all . 
  it was n't till the facts came out with the trial . 
  i watched the entire case , read the entire notes of the [ fbi investigators \\ ( starts page 97 \\ ) ] ( http://www.clickorlando.com/blob/view/-/15490330/data/1/-/kligxm/-/zimmerman-documents.pdf ) , and it 's just not there . 
  this falls under what we call `` racism vulnerability '' where people who have faced racism against them repeatedly in their life begin to assume all events are the consequence of racism . 
  in short it really says something when reddit is overall outspoken liberal and came running to lynch george zimmerman has woken up to the media spun play narrative of the case . 
  one in which the news media had to keep playing to keep their viewers during the trial . 
  the worst example was how the `` star witness '' rachel jeantel admits on stand to avoid another perjury charge that she had lied during her deposition with district attorney to help trayvon martin 's mother get george zimmerman arrested . 
  i have yet to hear that played on any news network . 
  instead the `` white ass cracker '' got played by only a few select news networks . 
  this should have never gone to trial -- ever !, 
  al , they bet on the wrong case and they should be the ones to blame every time you see a joke on reddit today , and i , dejaboo am a racist ... 
  yes , do you know how to do primary research ? 
  you have n't shown me one yet ? 
  and you have dodged every single point so i 'm tired of your bs . 
  ** the big one !, 
  pilgrims being a myth ... **, 
  tell me , how do you know that `` study '' meets the requirement to be scientific ( i.e. , reliable and valid ) . 
  or , any of those studies listed on ... oh my , let me contain my laughter ... skeptictank.org faith much ? 
  ha ha , keep dodging any accountability and keep focusing on `` stupid pilgrims '' i see . 
  no offense but your best source is n't even relevant and says so itself :  a decline in religious observance ** over the last century ** was directly linked to a rise in average intelligence , he * claimed * you can not compare our access of information -- the information age , gepetto -- with people over 300 years ago . 
  let alone say it 's a personality trait or linked with intelligence . 
  you have logical fallacies running amok with the majority of your links being crap to back up your claim even if they were relevant to this discussion . 
  take a breather and reread the above comments i made and learn . 
  do n't be ignorant and keep arguing when its a lost cause . 
  tl ; dr the only person being stupid and having faith being the epicenter of this discussion so far has been you . 
  edit : 1st [ `` the pilgrims '' is pretty much a myth ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/tetoc/why_do_the_american_pilgrims_get_so_much_credit/ ) . 
   ` religious fanatic ' is certainly a personality trait . 
  source . 
   these were not the best nor brightest human beings history had to offer . 
  and since when was religiosity associated with intelligence ? 
  i did n't know religion was a personality . 
  if i did n't know better , i would think i was getting slapped around for being a yank on here . 
  so i guess i 'm going to have to answer this question in more detail ... you would think , looking at the nation you represent you should n't be asking a '' ? '', 
  but answering . 
  afterall your national empire during the `` age of discovery '' was one of the largest exploiters of the new world . 
  * settler colonialism ( religious , political , and/or economic reasons ) * exploitation colonialism ( we want your shit or your people ) * plantation colonialism ( more what you guys did to the scotts ) * surrogate colonialism ( not related to americas , but way to go with zionism being transplanted in jordan [ aka palestine ] ) obviously , the first two were the main reasons for the populations of the `` new world . '', 
  i included the rest because i was on a roll and you seemed a bit lost on this topic . 
  i hope this helps . 
  i was speaking more about the nature of how `` risky '' the undertaking was for such a voyage regardless of one 's motivation and therefore one may assume how much more on average such a person was a `` risk taker . '', 
  afterall , personality traits are inheritable and is therefore relevant to the discussion . 
   basically in civil war yeah , right ... 
  i would really like `` civil war '' to be operational defined so mexico is included and then compared to every nation and see how that turns out . 
  but ... 
  i love vikings :'(, 
  quite brilliant !, 
  actually  early research on suicide postulated that suicide rates would be highest in areas and among groups where individuals experience social isolation , where the population was least connected through traditional bonds of social networks and social institutions . 
  thus , areas experiencing rapid demographic change , sporting weak social institutions , and marked by low levels of civic engagement and integration ( sometimes called low social capital '' ) were expected to have higher suicide rates . 
  why ? 
  because members of such communities lack social supports and networks -- the protective factors that help us weather personal crises and find or rediscover meaning in their lives . 
  http://cdclv.unlv.edu//healthnv/suicide.html add intertwined factors : * economic hardship * loss of job * loss of spouse * loss of social status * loss of home * divorce ( all the above ) * social stigma ( e.g. , accusation/imprisonment ) and these are the relatively `` rationale '' ones we can list ... you clearly have this perspective that what suicidal people face is permanent . 
  this is false in the vast majority of the situations and is no different than the irrational thinking murderers go down . 
  for example , you are going to tell me is [ jackie chan ] ( http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/jackie-chan.s-marriage-sparked-suicides ) announcing he is getting married or other countless irrational , stupid fucking reasons teenagers commit suicide is okay ? 
  yes , 
   so basically , you want to force someone to live an excruciatingly painful life so they wo n't hurt you emotionally ? 
  even if they perceive their existence to be more stressful for you than their going away , they are assholes to you for doing the latter ? 
  fuck you . 
  um , so you did n't digest the entire post ?
