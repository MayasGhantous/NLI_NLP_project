   exceptions may be right to termination for health reasons just the same as self-defense for killing someone, 
  how so ? 
  please quote where i was sensitive . 
  because i felt i was being very constructive and educational so you could better understand . 
  by just responding that way , so quickly i might add without digesting the material i would say you are being defensive about being one or more of the following : * ignorant * bigoted * uneducated * clearly out classed * epic fail in snobbery any i missed ? 
  hm , you did n't clarify your statement * how * you are defending rednecks . 
   race :  one of the categories from the many subcategorizations of the human species . 
  [ like these ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=redneck&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=w0klubelacqaiwk_5oh4dq&amp;ved=0caoq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1091 ) i do n't think you understand the term race . 
  race is complicated and not 3 , 5 , colors . 
  in fact it so complicated that biologist anthropologist could define all the races in the world ( over 400 estimated ) but would never do it because people have a deluded view what `` race '' is . 
  so even anthopologists have waved their hands and have agreed that [ `` race '' is socially predicated ] ( http://www.livinganthropologically.com/2012/02/18/race-is-a-social-construction/ ) ( i.e. , redneck therefore is/can be a race ) . 
  however , redneck is associated with a geological area ( usa ) , a ses , a color of skin or commonly race ( white ) . 
  so it is a racial slur . 
  you going on about :  i 've seen a number of people that would have been called a redneck in their younger years grow up , move to nyc , california , europe , etc. 
  and take on more of the lifestyle of the locals . 
  what you just said ( now please stay calm ) sounds very similar to :  i 've seen a number of blacks that would have been called a nigger in their younger years grow up , move to nyc , california , europe , etc. 
  and take on more of the lifestyle of the locals . 
  of course i will humbly admit the latter is more emotionally loaded because of political reasons , but that does not change the merit . 
  the above phrase would be only approiate ( if at all ) if you were accepted member of the community that could say those terms . 
  but in this case of redneck you state you are not one and then state you are defending rednecks and then go on about how calling them rednecks and ** presume ** then in an odd way hint at they still need to `` grow up . '', 
   i do n't really do any of that anymore . 
  i guess i grew out of it ? 
  i do n't feel like is the right way to put it but it kinda worked out that way . 
  i guess i just changed . 
  which is why i say you can change . 
  the reality is it 's a `` cultural '' difference . 
  it 's not classism . 
  there are very wealthy rural people . 
  it 's not intelligence or education though when it comes to grade level achievement the mean is less . 
  however if we compare trade skills and achiemement ? 
  * tl ; dr sorry for the lecture , but i have come accross this all my life , 
  disagree , as a person who has suffered the loss of close relative from suicide and witnessed the devastation from both of these issues in therapy , suicide is definitely a very selfish and horrendous act . 
  you are being a dick ( exceptions may be right to termination for health reasons just the same as self-defense for killing someone ) . 
  it is whirlwind of destruction on people and to be honest it seems to have a longer lasting impact on loved ones . 
  after all if you think about it , with suicide you have the murder and the victim be the same person . 
  you are grieving the loss and the anger of the murder at the same time on the same individual . 
  a very complex grieving process and a very `` dickish '' move . 
  ah , your defense of rendencks was not clear at all to me . 
  as a person with redneck heritage i did n't see that at all . 
  i do see it as a slur in certain contexts ( e.g. , definitely this sub ) and you seemed to rebuff that by saying  redneck is n't a race . 
  or even something you ca n't change . 
  care to elaborate then what you meant by that statement then ? 
  now , my guess is your wiki is just adjusted data for timeliness . 
  where as the map is for [ this data page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/user:denkb%c3%a4r/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate ) by wiki . 
  fighting a migraine , so i do n't feel like trying to compare the data sets you have seen . 
  i 'm actually just taking your word for it . 
  but does that fit the differences you are seeing ? 
  now , to be fair we would have to look at the same `` up-to-date '' for homicide rates for data as well . 
  you keep winning at snobbery though , 
  you care to be more constructive since i believe the map is from that same data source ? 
  it may not be as up to date , but surely you could add to the discussion than a link for the viewer to go , `` um , what exactly is your point ? '', 
  or are you from / r/politics, 
  as a person who was raised a redneck , first generation to go to college , graduate and on to graduate school -- i trump you :p, 
  personally , as a retired psychologist , i think it 's relevant . 
  does n't `` mental health '' come up in this discussion ? 
  here 's the various nations comparisons and i find it very interesting . 
  it makes sense from my perspective that this would be relatively balanced out equation as aggression is a part of the `` human condition . '', 
  please note how bad russia has it :( and also take time to notice the color scheme are different in each map . 
  * [ suicide rates in nations across the world ( by least to worse , blue , yellow , red ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/suicide_rates_map-en.svg ) * [ homicide rates in nations across the world ( darker blue = higher rate ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/map_of_world_by_intentional_homicide_rate.png ) tl ; dr simply internal vs. 
  external aggression, 
  or ... [ the farther north you go in the americas the better effect ( in general ) . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:map_of_world_by_intentional_homicide_rate.png ) i really despise comparing our young nations ( sorry , but americas are absurdly young ) to such older and much more established nations . 
  we are still just developing . 
  the usa is the oldest independent nation and is just over 236 years old . 
  and the first 8 years did n't have a constitution in place ... another factor for my fine european friends , please keep in mind what was the average personality and fortitude for people in 16th-18th century to sail clear across the atlantic ocean to the americas ? 
  this is the bedrock of our culture -- our ancestors . 
  i would say there is some truth is this statement ( e.g. , utah ) though i ca n't support it easily . 
  academia seems to tip toe around this topic and honestly it gets complicated rather quickly with how complex urban areas are with multiculturalism in the usa ( e.g. , ny , ny ) . 
  and note , even utah is complicated with a high percentage of catholics almost rivaling mormons ( shrugs ) . 
  interesting little battle going on there . 
  hmmm , care to source ? 
  cause this is false when it comes to sexual violence i know for sure . 
  but i do tend to agree the summer brings it on . 
  but then the fence in my ass , or brain then goes anthropological and notes how colder climate people tend to be more `` war '' like ( but that 's a whole different can of worms ) . 
  redneck 1 . an uneducated , unsophisticated , or poor white person , typically used to describe residents ( of either gender of the rural us . 
  whoa !, 
  i guess you and i have different versions of '' [ red necks ] ( http://i.bnet.com/blogs/map-usa-rural-suburban-city-locales-2003-660px.gif ) '' then . 
  * montana * idaho * dakotas * wyoming etc. 
  pretty much any state with high rural with low urban population that is not against the usa mexican border ( i.e. , illegal drug trade ) . 
  tl ; dr way to suck up to the european myth here , mshotts . 
  get that vitamin d mate and avoid rickets , 
  this map just ca n't be right ... or i feel so sorry for soooooo many of you ... 
  i mean seattle is a blessing ? 
  what ? 
  i 'm sorry is there a source . 
  i know seattle gets a bad rap but it is known for well over 120 days of cloud cover straight . 
  that 's no sun . 
  it 's not about attitude ( idealism ) ; it 's about being a realistic . 
  this topic is about economics and that means ** money !, 
  ** the war on drugs is a huge business in america and that business will have its guns ( period ) . 
  you people in europe are in a fog about this topic and instead of listening you are preaching . 
  thanks !, 
   stop talking about what you do n't understand . 
  are you living and from germany ? 
  if so , that is really hard to swallow from someone clear from the other side of the world talking about my nation and my neighboring nation . 
  you are really representing your country well in this thread with that comment . 
  just because the usa has cracked down on `` organized crime '' greater than mexico does not mean the effect of gang/drug trafficking crime is any less . 
  so mexico moves with large numbers ( suppliers ) out in the open while usa 's are small and turf fighting ( distributors ) does not negate statistics . 
  which , btw , your rational may equal more homicide figures for the usa seeing as police shooting criminals are n't counted as homicides .
