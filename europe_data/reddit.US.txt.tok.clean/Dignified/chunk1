youre all over the place . 
  color ( noun ) and colorare ( verb ) are latin . 
  is opening a new tab yourself and typing in ` color etymology ' really that difficult ? 
  [ color etymology ] ( http://www.google.com/m?&amp;q=color+etymomogy#q=color+etymology&amp;spell=1 ) edit : i think this is deserving of a xpost to / r/iamverysmart . 
  further away from what ? 
  you guys and the non original versions ? 
  color ( latin original ) vs colour ( old french taken * from * latin ) labor ( latin original ) vs labour ( again , old french taken * from * latin ) adding in ` u ' to words in a superfluous manner got you ` favourite ' . 
  once again laitn - no ` u. ', 
  all through its history up until fairly recently . 
  manoeuvre , once again the french taking a latin words and adding in letters to account for palate shape . 
  considering the us uses the original spelling of the words , or closer to them , who or what are they further from ? 
  and ` colour ' came from ` color ( noun : e.g. , red ) and colorare ( verb : coloring ) ( latin ) . 
  armor came from armare . 
  point being , just because ` old french ' has old in the title does n't mean its the origin language . 
  color - original colo * u * r - not original colo ~ ~ u ~ ~ r ( us ) - original edit formatting fix and spelling, 
  why add in letters you do n't need for pronunciation ? 
  why not make every word like ` knife ? ', 
  kas klong kas kwe kare kadding kin kletters ... for reference : ` color ' is latin . 
  ` colour ' is the old french derivative . 
  we ( us ) are using the original . 
  same for ` labor . ', 
  us is using the original . 
  not you . 
  you have the french version . 
  neighbor ( lit : near-inhabitants ) was english . 
  that one we altered * from * the original . 
  we changed the ` u ' to ` o ' . 
  but you changed the ` neah ' to ` nei ' , so apparently improving on old english is the hip thing to do . 
  edit : punctuation fix and words, 
  we have two english options in the us . 
  * english ( uk ) * english ( us ) english ( us ) is very useful . 
  it removes the ` u ' from ` colo ~ ~ u ~ ~ r ' . 
  it also makes us pronounce ` aluminum ' different than the uk for some reason . 
  apparently not . 
  your unemployment is breaking records . 
  maybe they tried your idea , realized it was n't ever going to work , then changed their mind . 
  wow . 
  hes been in america for decades . 
  i find this highly suspect . 
  especially given the [ times ] ( http://www.buzzfeed.com/mhastings/congressmen-seek-to-lift-propaganda-ban ) . 
  playing the race card is a cheap political tool . 
  he demolished clegg in the debate . 
  [ then the propaganda machine went into overdrive ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/10839017/clegg-nigel-farages-beer-swilling-bonhomie-mask-is-slipping-to-reveal-nasty-view-of-britain.html ) . 
  as soon as miliband wanted to bar farage from the televised election debate the jig was up . 
  every human with a pule and 2 braincells to rub together could see what the reason was . 
  fear . 
  possibly of * many * things . 
  not just one . 
  possible examples include : 1 can not handle farage in a debate 2 can not handle possibly getting called out ; in a very big , very public way . 
  3 can not give farage a platform with which to strip possibly more disenchanted lab/cons , from their current voting base , into the evil-flock . 
  i hope his party does *** very *** well in the upcoming elections . 
  this is sad . 
  like one of the most pathetic propaganda attempts yet . 
  the stock market is dead . 
  they 're passing your money , through the corpse , to the wealthy . 
  to put not too fine a point on it . 
  i feel for you . 
  you have the same issue as everyone else currently . 
  you elected corrupt assholes and you ca n't get rid of them . 
  american born-italian heritage . 
  the eu is covertly giving funds to moldova to crack down on transnistria separatists . 
  better cover than the usual . 
  so there 's that . 
  better supercharge that propaganda mill . 
  the eu is gon na need all that lng if ( when ) russia cuts off supply . 
  this is the most blatantly retarded propaganda released thus far . 
  not even trying anymore . 
  could be . 
  could be propaganda . 
  believing either ( any ) side at this point is a testament to willful ignorance . 
  us controlling interest in this makes it hard to swallow . 
  more than likely this will be who can outfraud who . 
  could be referencing the euthanasia or the commission building in brussels . 
  he 's not the president , for one . 
  this was a coup . 
  we 've all heard the tapes . 
  being the us governments willing patsy is the problem . 
  not a birthday . 
  ffs , you 're not only watching history repeat , you 're participatory . 
  [ yes , yes the have ] ( http://www.foodgeeks.com/recipes/awesome-apple-bread-2901 ) . 
  relevant : http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/11/shell-chevron-ukraine-idusl5e8gbae020120511, 
  the us is using the eu ( among others ) . 
  they do n't give a shit about their own citizens . 
  what makes the delusional eu think they 're different ? 
  the us government is using/will continue to use you as a patsy . 
  edit : stuff, 
  lol . 
  no it ca n't . 
  moreover , this trying to spread western debt to old soviet bloc nations might not go over well ; no matter what media is telling you . 
  elections wo n't happen . 
  the us got its $ 5billion coup planted government , it wo n't risk loosing its investment . 
  globalpost is n't a legit news site . 
  its a pr distribution hub attempting to look like independent media . 
  does n't anyone remember this ? 
  when was the last time a city worker just started building * anything * without permission ? 
  they do n't do that here in california . 
  lol . 
  why even bother to write all of this ? 
  just type `` watch cnn to know what i think . '', 
  save yourself some time .
