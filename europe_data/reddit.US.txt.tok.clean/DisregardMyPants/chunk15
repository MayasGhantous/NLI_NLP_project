   from a systemic pov we have no reason to allow that . 
  we 're missing hundreds of billions in taxes here . 
  enough to fix our budget equilibrium . 
  the point of the eu is not just to make the us oligarchs richer and the eu crashing , sorry . 
  i do n't think you realize what you 're talking about here . 
  if people paid tax on any income * derived from * the eu , you guys would be cut off from the internet entirely . 
  a blogger who had 500 views on their blog from 25 countries would have pay income tax in 25 countries if that 's how many countries her viewers came from ( on a whopping $ 0.50 of income ) , and on top of that the taxes paid would be * higher * than her total income from those views . 
  what you 're talking about is just not economically literate . 
  it 's not an opposing point of view , it 's just ignorant . 
  it 's apparent to me that you 're not getting the issue here , so i 'm going to try and give an example of what the issue has become with multi-national internet based corporations . 
  * ** you own widgets inc , a us-based web service ** . 
  it has 2 us-based child companies : widgetsales llc , and widgetdev llc . 
  * ** the parent company exists just to hold the other 2 into a single entity . 
  ** it will never turn a profit or revenue , as it 's profits are paid through widgetsales llc * ** widgetsales llc gets the customers , widgetdev llc builds the product . 
  ** widgetsales llc pays widgetdev llc whatever their expenses are to exist . 
  * in the above scenario , widgetdev llc will always break even , widgetsales llc will profit and have their profit taxed . 
  this is totally above board as no tax is avoided . 
  they can sell their product anywhere in the world with no problems . 
  now , let 's say widget dev llc wants to hire some talent in britain and sweden . 
  in many places , you * can not do this * without registering a corporation in those regions . 
  * ** widget dev brit and widget dev swede ** are now established and wholly owned by widget dev llc . 
  all of their revenue comes from widget dev llc , which pays their expenses . 
  they break even every year as a result , because all sales still go to widget sales llc . 
  income tax * for employees * and other associated taxes are paid . 
  * ** widget sales llc opens up widget support in india . 
  ** it 's a glorified call center . 
  it gets paid out of widget sales llc 's income . 
  it is also breaking even now , and produces no revenue not paid to it by widget sales llc . 
  -------------------------------------- this is a realistic example . 
  what 's happening right now is that ( for example ) india , britain , and sweden say '' * hey !, 
  widgets inc has an office in our country and has customers in our countries , why are n't we getting income tax from their profit ? 
  * '' widgetsinc is paying taxes , and doing everything they should . 
  the issue becomes that aside from the current system where widgetsales turns the profit , there 's no way to decide how much widgetsupport is responsible for , or either of the 2 other child companies . 
  they produce no profit , just product . 
  it is an absolutely unwinnable scenario . 
   if you do n't pay a correct amount of tax and everyone does it and it 's causing systemic failure , then , by definition , for me , it 's a loophole . 
   you * are * paying the correct amount of tax . 
  if you were n't , the countries would actually be able to create problems for you . 
  the problem is simply that they all feel entitled to the same money and only one or two entities actually produce revenue and take in money ( and get that income taxed accordingly ) . 
   i 'm sorry but crashing the continent because nobody wants to pay those is not acceptable . 
  practically everyone is paying * somewhere * , and in a lot of those cases it 's not a tax haven either . 
  in most countries you need some kind of entity there to do certain things . 
  so you end up with a lot of non-revenue producing entities just so you can employ people . 
   you should have to pay all you taxes a single time for the operations in europe , but you should pay those in europe . 
  no `` i pay my ( absence of ) taxes in bahamas '' bullshit . 
  that 's not what i 'm saying . 
  i 'm saying these are companies that have a bunch of locations in different countries and * most of them are not responsible for directly producing income in a taxable way * . 
  if your ( for example ) finnish operation is only doing tech support , * they produce no taxable profit * . 
  if you have programmers in italy but they only create 10 % of the product ( or even more ) it 's the same . 
  only one or two entities directly make sales and produce revenue , no matter how many support entities ( tech support , development , hr , whatever ) exist to make that possible . 
  this is a structure that is * legally required * by many countries . 
   your product is sold somewhere in europe if you make money there . 
  and that money is taxable . 
   your product is sold somewhere in europe if you make money there . 
  and that money is taxable . 
   i consider the country the european union here , as for why , it 's simple `` you are making money here '' . 
  income tax is not paid based on where you make money , it 's based on where the entity making the money is located . 
  if i sell t-shirts to someone in london , i pay american income tax on that income , not british . 
  that 's the same for every country . 
  where this starts to get messy is when you have a section of a company that * does n't produce revenue * located in a country that a foreign parent company also has customers in . 
  that entity is * not * producing revenue and hence does * not * pay income tax ( beyond the taxes related to paying payroll ) . 
   hey , i 'm not writing the law myself nor can possily know every single petty details in the entire system . 
  i ai n't some all knowing kim jong il teaching a farmer how to do it 's job . 
  details like this are the job of law makers or accountants . 
  i 'm just saying they ought to start working on collecting taxes in a clear cut and efficient way and to close all the fucking loopholes . 
   i run a software company with offices in 2 countries , so it 's kind of a pet issue of mine . 
  here 's the thing though : in a lot of cases * it 's not a loophole * . 
  it 's just a country `` not getting as much as they wanted '' . 
  multiple countries publicly ( though not legally ) claim the exact same money from the exact same transactions , then say that the only reason they did n't get it was a loophole . 
  the british ( for example ) will look at a company and say `` oh , they collected $ 50 million from british citizens '' , and think `` therefore we are entitled to standard income tax on that $ 50 million '' ... ignoring that at no point was britain ( or a british office ) involved in the actual sale or that they played a very limited role in the creation the product and that * legally * the tax is owed to whoever made the sale or made the product . 
   it 's not , imho , abuse or unthinkable to expect irs employees to start collecting goddam money and being an actual tax agency to run the system and pay pensions in time instead of all taking bribes ( oh , sorry , it 's true you all call it '' campaign contribution '' nowadays ) to forget about it . 
  no one in the irs is elected , so none of them campaign ... but this is a legitimately difficult issue . 
  when pressed few people ( even those complaining about not receiving taxes ) can actually articulate * why * their country should be the one receiving the taxes and not any of the other ones involved in the transaction . 
   wage taxes in sweden and everywhere else , income taxes in canada , bank taxes in ireland and ad vat or related taxes in sweden . 
  that 's still a lot of taxes . 
  currently some companies like apple pay next to nothing . 
  and that 's not acceptable . 
  yes , and it is my understanding that they pay all those . 
  income tax is what gets debated so heavily ... because where was the money `` earned '' comes into play . 
  processing ? 
  where the product was made ( how much of the product ) ? 
  where the sale came from ? 
  where the headquarters are ? 
  even if what you 're saying was true , it would be utterly irrelevant . 
   then tax avoidance is another thing . 
  you make tons of cash , start paying your taxes !, 
   this one is trickier than it sounds . 
  a lot of countries lay claim to taxes based of the same profits . 
  if a company is based in the us , has a tech/development office in sweden , has a canadian close the sale , and has it 's credit card processing in ireland , but the customer buying ad space is swedish , who has the best claim to the tax revenue ? 
  a lot of these companies are n't exactly doing their best to pay , but countries are going to be pissed at them no matter what . 
  it will be accessible , but only if you can find it . 
  which you wo n't be able to . 
   that 'd assume they are deported to sweden . 
  i think most of these illegal immigrants are from africa and middle east , it 's not that easy to get to northern europe from there . 
  it would make sense they go to sweden , as sweden is the 2nd largest group of immigrants in norway ( besides the poles ) . 
  i was hoping for something a bit more `` direct from merkel '' , but it 's a start . 
  dear germany , please ? 
  do something ? 
  finally ? 
  no one would blame you .
