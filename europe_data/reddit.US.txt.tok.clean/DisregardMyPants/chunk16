  love always , me, 
   dude , i meant a maximum of veto 's per month or year or something like that . 
   that does n't change anything . 
   the un is a expensive club where the big boys can sit and veto stuff all day long . 
  fucking pointless for the remaining 200 member countries to be part of it . 
  it 's not pointless . 
  it let 's them air grievances , request support , whatever . 
  but yes , in the un ( as they would on a battlefield - the alternative to the un ) they have to abide by the most powerful people in the room . 
   they should have a maximum of veto 's . 
  they 're throwing them around like they 're not worth anything . 
  no , they should n't . 
  because someday someone will be out of vetos and there will be an issue important enough to go to war over . 
  then we get world war 3 . 
  the un is slow , but it helps keep our species alive by averting nuclear war . 
  i 'm alright with slow , conservative movement if that 's what we get for it . 
   because as it stands a few nations basically control the entire un ... it 's still rooted to deeply into the system of empires/superpowers . 
  yes , because those superpowers are the ones who can go to war and cause serious problems . 
  * the un is supposed to prevent wars , it 's not supposed to be fair * . 
  part of that means that nations powerful enough to go-it-alone in war can also go-it-alone in vetoes . 
  the un would n't function without that . 
  the entire point is to avoid wars , and allowing nations large enough to conduct a significant war singlehandedly a veto is how we make sure they do n't happen . 
  spoiler : it was us . 
  neither would i ? 
  but then there 's countries like finland where the only minority group to break 1 % of the population is the swedes ... 
  `` damn it . 
  i 've had that song stuck in my head all day . 
  it cost me like $ 50 ! '', 
   every . 
  single . 
  time . 
  that the healthcare debate is brought up : `` well it only works in europe because those countries are small and homogeneous . '', 
   i think this is a very different statement than the title of this thread . 
  europe as a whole is definitely not homogenous ( which is what the treat title implies ) . 
  individual countries ? 
  that 's different . 
   it will be interesting to see if this passion for the game lasts . 
  every world cup they talk about if soccer/football will finally catch on in the us , only to see that energy dissipate soon after . 
  maybe this time will be different . 
  who knows ... 
  i really do n't think we have enough regional teams to make that happen ( 14 top-tier teams ) . 
  sports catch on in the us when there 's games every few days , preferably televised . 
  it takes infrastructure . 
  saudi arabaia does not allow tourist visas . 
   sorry , i read a bit fast and thought it was yet another post of / u/disregardmypants [ 1 ] , who only argue on `` freeedooooom freedooom ! '', 
  and that i 'm a racist anti muslim . 
  my apologies . 
  start making arguments that actually involve the veil ban instead of arguments that are about general `` muslimness '' and i 'll stop pointing it out . 
   yep , religious law . 
  sorry that one is illegal here . 
  it 's not `` religious law '' . 
  it 's `` religion '' . 
  someone following it voluntarily . 
   which is code for `` i do n't want it , but if i do n't in the middle east they will beat me '' . 
  so when someone does n't say what you want you just make things up ? 
  bulletproof argument style there . 
   exactly  and for that ... you need to make that stuff ... 
  illegal . 
  yup . 
  you ca n't send cops after people for legal things . 
  what a surprise . 
  no one is going to fault you with using police to take down shadow-courts . 
  banning religious/cultural practices that do nothing to harm you or others is different . 
   no , about niqab enforcers and salafists , while you try to twist it like i had a thing against moderates who are 99 % of the muslims   denouncing extremists is n't racism , sorry . 
  i denounce just as much the westboro and jesuscamp fuckheads . 
  does n't mean i 'm anti christian . 
  the difference being that you see this as a strike against an entire people - the point of the law is n't actually the law . 
  the point is to make people who make you uncomfortable feel uncomfortable . 
  there 's a million laws you could pass or enforce that would * actually target what the behaviors you 're worried about * , but you 're not doing that because the behaviors are n't the actual point . 
   oh this is rich - an american telling us what to do !, 
   ** you caught me ** . 
  now do you have an actual argument ? 
   except there are no women who actually wants it . 
  try finding more than a single example disproving what i said . 
   http://www.cnn.com/2010/world/europe/02/04/france.burqa.ban/ http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-great-niqab-debate took under 10 seconds . 
   i 'm not big on describing the mechanism but basically we have way to ensure that kids go out at least till they are adults ( 18h ) if only by school registers . 
  if people go missing , we notify child protection service , who do have wide discretionary powers . 
  also , sequestration generally make a big , biiiiiig scandale when found . 
  they are extremely rare . 
  ah , so that protects ... well , practically no one . 
  most muslims do n't wear face coverings when they 're children , and adoption among 2nd generation muslims is n't too high either . 
  so most people wearing them wo n't fall into this category . 
   say the guys who never had nor bothered to deal with any of the salafist fanatism coming from middle east and just let others wade in it then are the first to become self righteous if we attempt to adress anything . 
  i 'm tempted to say `` fuck off ''  grew up in an area that was right next to a 40 % + muslim area . 
  try again . 
   no , they beat or stone to death women who do n't wear it in their areas of control . 
  so essentially we 're now admitting that a burqa ban will do nothing to inhibit isis and has nothing to do with them . 
  good .

  once again : the veil ban will do nothing about this . 
   actually they tried  making `` patrols '' to beat people on the street and such . 
  and you know the best way to stop that kind of bullshit ? 
  sending cops after their enforcers and making the whole thing illegal from end to end by patching every single loophole . 
  very , very , very , very few `` patrols '' ever existed ( even with a sizable muslim population ) . 
  deal with them the same way you would a drug-addled area : with police . 
   the muslims are no problem . 
  and most of them are even repulsed by the niqab actually . 
  extremists who tried to take root and enforcing their own `` religious laws '' `` because religious freedom '' are the problem . 
  quoting your own president  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/29fpb0/obama_european_jihadists_threaten_us/[2] which is why none of your complaints actually had anything to do with face coverings , right ? 
  ** you 're just ranting about muslims , not anything that will actually be impacted by this law . 
   yet here we are with problems of our own .
