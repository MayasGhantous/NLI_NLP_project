  the legal process for removal required * his presence * and he fled before that could happen ... not to a safe haven in the east or crimea ( where if he truly felt threatened he would have been welcome ) but outside of ukrainian legal jurisdiction and into russia . 
  everything that * could * be done legally * was * done legally . 
   out of the other things you listed - not delivering packages to the region if they 're addressed to the annexed region only impacts the people there . 
  probably should have gone with the legal way for leaving ukraine . 
  you ca n't seriously be upset that ukraine does n't consent to and cooperate with the illegal annexation of their country by a foreign power ? 
   also : `` denying them the ability to control their air space '' is not remotely the same thing as `` choosing not to fly there ''  that 's the mechanism : by saying the air space is still in ukrainian control , they prevent a great number of planes from flying there . 
   finally - expecting every separation process to be on good terms is naive . 
  unless you are also into not letting anyone divorce unless their spouse agrees , or anyone quit their job unless employer agrees . 
  even on small scale , separation is complicated . 
  there was a legal method for leaving in ukraine . 
  crimea did not follow it , even slightly . 
  modern nations work by investing money into regions via debt , then making that money back via the growth that results from the investment . 
  that is why you are n't typically allowed to unilaterally leave a country . 
  even then , there was no legitimate vote that said crimea should leave . 
   disincentives for who ? 
  the country that 1 ) has to support crimea . 
  2 ) we want to stop from benefitting from annexing crimea . 
   the other stance of `` lets all gang up on crimea because they decided to be part of russia rather then ukraine '' - well that 's just plain evil as you are attempting to outright force your will on them . 
  nope , the stance is '' * if crimea wants to be russian , they can go through the legal ukrainian process for doing so . 
  * ''  also ... 
  i would n't want to see anyone attempt to `` deny them use of their airspace '' - them being russia in this case , one of the world 's leaders in missile technology , anti-air in particular . 
  [ not everything is solved by force . 
  ] ( http://rbth.com/business/2014/07/07/icao_recognizes_crimean_airspace_as_russian_37997.html ) - '' * in mid-march 2014 , ukrainian air traffic control services closed the airports in simferopol and sevastopol as well as lower airspace over crimea `` until further notice '' . 
  as a result , eurocontrol ( european organization for the safety of air navigation ) banned european airlines from flying to any airports in crimea or passing through the region . 
   that 's a ridiculous argument . 
  it has been annexed , regardless of whether anyone thinks it 's legitimate and regardless of what maps say . 
  repeating a lie does n't make it real , and stating the truth does n't mean you approve of it . 
  actually , in a way it does . 
  it allows you to more easily isolate the region and create disincentives for similar actions in the future . 
  it 's a way of enforcing `` no-man 's land '' status . 
  this can be everything from not delivering packages to the region if they 're addressed to the annexed region , denying them the ability to control their air space , refusing to do business with businesses there ( conflict in regional ownership creates conflict in taxes ) , etc. 
  i 'll do some quick numbers for the us : * ** bars ** $ 1 per beer or shot , $ 2 for a cocktail . 
  this will help you get served faster , especially if you 're making them make you cocktails . 
  * ** restaurants ** - 20 % is pretty much standard . 
  10 % says '' * i hate you * '' . 
  * ** taxis ** - evil bastards . 
  they recently updated a lot of meters to offer 20 % as the minimum , this is bullshit . 
  press `` custom '' and hit 10 % or 0 % . 
  because really , fuck taxi drivers . 
  take an uber . 
  * ** carryout/takeout ** most people wo n't notice if you do n't tip unless you 're a regular , but 10 % is a good rule of thumb . 
  --------------------------- not everyone gets tipped `` because living wage '' - a lot of the time it 's just because you want service at a reasonable speed from someone who has to prioritize a lot ( bartenders ) . 
   i mean , obviously , it was priced 950 so that you leave the change ... it should be seen as a suggestion , a nudge ... 
  i would * never * pick up on that . 
  it legitimizes the russia move to annex it . 
  ... apparently a $ 2 billion tunnel . 
  and that 's the estimate . 
  what could go wrong ? 
   and pakistan does not have parts of india they could hit without destroying themselves ? 
  even ignoring the inevitable counterattack , many locations in both countries would be within the range of potential fallout . 
   we do n't wan na make the world dance ... eurovision makes so much more sense now . 
   crimea river . 
  then build me a bridge and get over it ? 
  ... still waiting on that bridge ... 
  [ from a different comment in this thread ] ( http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/taiwan.html ), 
   as oppose to russia and ukraine , which also border each other . 
  if you do n't mind hitting mostly trees there 's parts ukraine could hit in russia without directly destroying themselves ... though i 'm sure the counterattack would . 
   india and pakistan have skirmishes all the time , they 're nuclear and too close together to nuke eachother . 
   putin would n't invade ukraine , but a lot of ` volunteers ' could still make their way . 
  crimea * was * an invasion . 
  you send armed troops into another country , it 's an invasion . 
   so if they accidentally shot a torpedo to an american submarine , would n't they counter attack ? 
  and i mean ... 
  it 's not like you 're trying to soften relations ... that 's not a `` russia '' thing , that a `` anyone who attacks us '' thing . 
   placing all of those nato military bases on the border of russia ... we place nato bases in the countries who want to join . 
  that 's all . 
  russia is n't really worth special consideration in that regard - not in several decades . 
  they 're a weak country , not even really worthy of news coverage over here . 
  no , not really . 
  they 're not a threat anymore . 
  that 's absolutely idiotic . 
  the us and the ussr were not trusting of eachother . 
  there is no way in hell they would do such a thing verbally , and you have no evidence to suggest they did . 
  1 ) it would n't be a transcript , it 'd be a formal agreement . 
  2 ) no one has ever leaked a document , even after disagreement about its existence . 
  it 's ridiculous to think russia would n't under such circumstances if it existed . 
  if there was an agreement , it should n't be a problem for you to link us to a copy of the agreement ? 
  hilarious : he mentions / r/conspiracy , you reply with a globalresearch.ca article . 
  the soviet union collapsed . 
  that was winning . 
  the soviet communist ideology lost it 's largest supporter and began to fade away . 
   do n't be foolish , at the end of the cold war russia backed of if the west promised to not interfere in it 's slice of the third world . 
  absolute bullshit . 
  there is no documentation of this agreement * at all * and the ussr and the us were n't exactly trusting of each other to the extent they 'd let such a thing be spoken and not written . 
   few ? 
  how about defeating nazi germany with very little help from the rest of their allies . 
  russia played a major part in the war , but that 's getting carried away . 
  they had a lot of help , economically and militarily . 
  * those fucking imperialists are standing in the way of my empire !, 
   okay , but it does n't change that assange and company have some very sketchy connection to authoritarian regimes in eastern europe . 
  [ 1 ] by ` assange and company ' you mean one journalist you disagree with , with one example involving one country ? 
   also julian assange has a show on russian state media and has yet to release any of the damning information on russia that he supposedly had in 2010 . 
  you 're aware a lot of information on wikileaks was destroyed , right ? 
  i support greenwald , snowden , and assange and think this is a terrible fucking idea . 
  russia can not be counted on when it comes to free speech , expression , etc. 
   * of course the muslims may also fight because the russians would no doubt institute policies where non-muslims and non-homosexuals absolutely do n't have greater righter than the normal , native people * til gays are not native to sweden . 
   gazprom usually includes that in its contractual sales . 
  that is why you see such huge price variances within europe for russian gas . 
  because countries that buy it cheaply are not allowed to sell it to countries that pay more . 
  ... yes , i know .
