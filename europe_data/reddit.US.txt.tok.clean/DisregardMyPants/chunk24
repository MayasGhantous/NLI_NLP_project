  normally people do it without any actual whipped cream being involved . 
   that must be the most ingenious and cute way to get high i 've ever heard of . 
  how dangerous is it ? 
  overdosing on whipped cream gases sounds really embarassing . 
  it depends on how you do it . 
  using a balloon you can suffocate without noticing ( though most likely you 'll just ` fish out ' and drop it ) . 
  it 's really hyperventilating into the balloon ( which is how you use it ) that creates most risk . 
  coming [ out of a re-usable cracker ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tjrvyaf.jpg ) the immediate risks are pretty low . 
  long term you can kill some brain cells and run into some vitamin-b related problems if you have heavy usage . 
  [ disposable cans will fuck you up though ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eqkhovf.jpg ) , as it 's not just nitrous coming out the end . 
  the important thing no matter how you do it is to make sure there 's some level of oxygen getting in . 
  i never said it was impossible . 
   your system sucks , it is confusing and overly complicated while the metric system is poetic simplicity !, 
  what is not simple is converting over 100 + years of blueprints , directions , screws , tools , machinery , etc. 
   ah , yes - the appeal to authority . 
  fuck you . 
  you 're an asshole . 
  how 's that for an insult , you insult-bringing motherfucker ? 
  asshole . 
  you happy now , i 'm down to your level ? 
  you started by being a dick . 
  '' * you must be joking . 
  i see your big fuck-off american flag . 
  * i see no reason to be overly nice in response . 
   edit : i do n't argue with people who do n't seem capable of amending their ideas . 
  i 've already made my argument , you 've yet to put forth a coherrent one for who you think is paying for your unemployment/benefits/etc , if not those who are actually working . 
  yes , it actually is . 
  you 're just making a fool of yourself at this point . 
   the country that i 'm from does make a difference in what i have to say -- as does the fact that i 've lived in other countries , some of which have real social-welfare systems . 
  it makes a difference in what you say , but i did n't impact what i said . 
  other people have to pay for you not working . 
  that is math and it is a fact no matter where you are . 
   i 'm american , and i can tell you from experience that what we have here is a systematic attempt to deny people assistance . 
  i do n't see how anybody could deny this assertion with any competent honesty . 
  well , i have an aunt on disability , have known numerous people ( especially in college ) on food stamps , and have several friends on unemployment . 
  so i 'd say yeah , people do actually get assistance . 
   and , in my opinion , the ideology -- the assumption that human labor is a zero-sum game and what i do n't suffer you 'll have to -- this is a large part of the problem . 
  if you are taking from the government , that money came from someone or some organization that is working . 
  that 's really the end of it . 
  while absolutely nothing you said is relevant to the truth in what i posted : yeah , we actually do have a social welfare system . 
  we 've got social security , medicare , unemployment , food stamps , and a litany of other protections . 
  but once again : what country i 'm from has nothing to do with this post . 
  yeah . 
  everyone else has to pay for you not working . 
  i 'm not completely familiar with how uk benefits work , but would n't making a certain ( generally low ) level of income at a job end up making you ineligible for several of those ? 
  then it should n't be hard to explain * why * . 
  if most people in a country have come to the conclusion it 's working a shit job for less money than benefits , there must be a common reasoning . 
  can you explain why someone would work a shit job for less money than thy can get by not working ? 
  by that logic should n't nicotine gums and patches be banned as well ? 
  they also provide nicotine . 
  the only difference is how they 're marketed ( at least in the us you ca n't market ecigs as smoking cessation devices ), 
  hard to know . 
  i 'm not sure what happens if you go through european securty ( determining you 're actually you ) and then go through canada ( where the data would presumably shared ) . 
  it really could go either way . 
  my understanding is that if you do n't share the data ( and verify it to a standard we support ) we pretty much do n't let you fly here . 
  what makes me curious is that even inserting middle-men ( us -  canada -  europe ) , most verification is done when you get on the first plane ... so i have no idea it would work trying to get * back * to the us, 
  [ it passed ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/us-nsa-surveillance-programme-surveillance-bodies-in-various-member-states-and-impact-on-eu-citizens-6.html ), 
  [ eu to vote to suspend u.s. data sharing agreements , passenger records amid nsa spying scandal ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1hmu2r/eu_to_vote_to_suspend_us_data_sharing_agreements/ ) - do n't know how successful it will be , but at least there 's * someone * attempting action . 
  it 's sad that this is the most optimistic response i expect to get ( especially with upvotes being as they are ), 
  i know . 
  i 'm just curious . 
  there 's a lot of countries where you can predict it , but especially the smaller countries are a mystery . 
  i have no idea what would happen in ireland , switzerland , greece , or any of the smaller countries really . 
  would there be pressure to keep him in ireland ? 
  it is absolutely incredible how little she says given how many words she uses . 
  this woman should be in a record book . 
  i do n't know for what , but she should be there . 
   turning yourself in is taking responsibility for your actions . 
  that 's what a responsible whistleblower would do . 
  no , it 's becoming a martyr . 
  there is nothing gained by him turning himself in , especially as he has no practical chance at having a fair trial here . 
  no potential harm is averted if he turns himself in and no potential people are saved . 
  i fail to see where this ` responsibility ' to martyr yourself comes in . 
   i do n't want him to martyr himself , there is not a snowball 's chance in hell that he gets a fair trial here . 
  he almost assuredly would not even have a * public * trial . 
   you ca n't break the law and face no consequences , even if it 's a law you disagree with . 
  yes you can , and he should . 
  this is nothing more than jury nullification on an international scale : if someone in a position of power ( be it a nation or a juror ) believes that you may have broken a law but the law is overwhelmingly wrong or abhorrent , they can extend to you protection ( via a ` not-guilty ' vote or protection if it 's a country ) the law is not the same thing as morality or ethics . 
  it does not determine what right or wrong is . 
   even snowden backed down from his orginal claims of `` i can wiretap everthing !! '', 
  to more most , `` okay well it 's tons of overseas metadata , things that 99.9 % of does n't even get looked at '' . 
  sometimes i wonder how many hundreds of times i 'm going to have to link to this for people who have completely failed to follow the issue . 
  [ these are the nsa ` minimization ' guidelines ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/20/fisa-court-nsa-without-warrant ) the nsa is explicitly authorized to '' * access the * ** content of communications ** * gathered from `` u.s. based machine [ s ] '' or phone numbers in order to establish if targets are located in the us , for the purposes of ceasing further surveillance . 
  * '' ... after which they can keep them for 5 years and will begin re-collecting full content if you change something that confuses their `` identity '' for you . 
  if they are not 51 % sure you 're an american , you will simply be spied on - with them having full copies of your communications - until either you die or they become 51 % sure . 
  the metadata line was absolute , unequivocal , bullshit . 
  they are not even capable of identifying who is/isn ' t an american without compiling and analyzing the ** content ** of your communications . 
   also are you new to the concept of international espionage ? 
  every country is spying on every country . 
  even allies . 
  it 's called cloak & dagger , not sunshine & puppies for a reason . 
  there is no country on the planet that can do this like the us can . 
  we are uniquely positioned in terms of the * huge * amount of internet traffic flowing through our country ( both domestic and foreign ) . 
  on top of that , no one has the budget . 
  [ you know that ' 5 zetabyte ' datacenter ] ( http://www.npr.org/2013/06/10/190160772/amid-data-controversy-nsa-builds-its-biggest-data-farm ) ? 
  at $ 40/terabyte ( 50 % of the retail cost ) it would take china 's entire military budget over 2 full years to be able to buy * just the hard drives * necessary for such a thing ... and china is the closest to the us in terms of defense spending . 
  essentially : no one else has the access to the volume of foreign information we do , and no one else can pay to deal with all the information . 
  other countries spy , but we are the * only ones * who are capable of putting the entire planet under persistent surveillance . 
  i was critical of this literally since the patriot act was written . 
  what exactly is this `` too late '' of which you speak ?
