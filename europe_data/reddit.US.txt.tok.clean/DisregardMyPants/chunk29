  hell , china has built an economy in large part off theft of trade secrets . 
  that 's how business works : your competitors will slit your throat and laugh while you sputter if they can . 
   complete transparency will give focus to what matters in the end : a good product . 
  it will only be complete transparency for eu based businesses . 
  outside the eu companies will just steal what they 're doing and keep their own business private . 
  they will figure out how the company is making a `` better product '' from their disclosures , duplicate it , then cut `` invisible '' corners like controversial supply chains . 
   lending would help if this was a just a liquidity issue . 
  now , it only exacerbates the problem . 
  it 's nothing compared to the problems that would occur if * they just could ' t get loans * which is the true alternative here . 
   also , lending is a risk if the collateral is smaller than the expected payoff . 
  there 's no real collateral here . 
   if you can effectively control your debtor it can hardly be called a risk the only way they can control greece is because of the terms of getting more loans . 
  the minute the money is in greece 's hands they lose the control they had . 
   besides , the same money would be spent on bailing out banks if they were n't lent to greece . 
  bailing out greece is effectively a `` double or nothing '' proposition . 
  you may * still * end up bailing out the banks , but for * more * money . 
   if you have a currency union certain regions will always be in deficit with respect to the more developed regions . 
  greece 's problem is n't that it 's undeveloped , it 's that they have massive amounts of corruption in all social classes and on all levels of society . 
  they have strong protections and safety nets for all of their citizens , but can not pay for it because of the levels of corruption and evasion . 
  if we were talking about bulgaria , you 'd have a point . 
  but greece is not an `` undeveloped '' problem . 
   accepting this fact has as a consequence that the borrowed money can never be repaid . 
  if this were true you 'd see over half the eurozone unable to repay ( romania , bulgaria , estonia , etc ) in similar straights . 
  but that 's not the case . 
  greece is a case unto itself because it 's problems are it 's own . 
   if you keep lending this impossible-to-repay money to the deficit regions with conditionalities , you are effectively turning them into huge debtor prisons . 
  the entire point is that the money they 're getting * is * possible to repay . 
  it 's at artificially lowered interest rates . 
  it 's buying them time to get their shit together . 
  without this external pressure , greece has no reason to reform itself . 
   it 's not unavoidable . 
  the eurozone countries are doing the absolute least to solve the problem . 
  it was a mistake for greece to join the eurozone in the first place but you can hardly argue that there is nothing else that can be done now . 
  the eurozone countries are loaning to them at absolutely massive risk . 
  they 're actually lending when * no one else would * . 
  they 're absorbing risk * no one else would * . 
  they 've gone so far as to keep loaning to the point where their own banking systems are at risk . 
  there 's not a hell of a lot more that can be done . 
  greece requires structural changes to continue . 
  throwing money at it will not help by itself . 
   you are conflating a sovereign state finances with a household 's finances . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  i 'm not saying all deficits are bad , i 'm saying that if you do n't control your own currency * you still need people to loan to you * , which greece would not have without austerity . 
  i ca n't think of a way to do this without exposing entire supply chains , new markets you 're trying to expand into , and other things that would be widely regarded as `` trade secrets '' . 
  it will be a challenge to make this work in a way that allows companies the privacy they need to not be outmaneuvered by other companies . 
   except that the greek state is coerced to cut expenses so much that it creates this sort of situation . 
  i 've had enough of greeks-blaming , this narrative has gotten to the point where it 's absolutely ridiculous . 
  the were n't coerced into cutting expenses because there was no option that involved `` continue things as normal '' because they were out of money . 
  there were 2 options 1 ) austerity to convince people loaning them money that there 's any chance at all they will be paid back . 
  2 ) default austerity where they have n't convinced lenders they can pay back , and they simply do n't have the money to pay . 
  this would be much , much worse . 
  bills simply not being paid , random services no longer functioning with little warning , etc. 
  it would be `` coercing '' them if they had their own money to spend , but they did n't . 
  what they were doing was trying to restore confidence to the point where there was any money available to them at all . 
  it 's sad ... but it 's unavoidable . 
   the destruction of the secondary industries is the obvious example . 
  no doubt they had their failures but history has proven viable , if more limited , secondary manufacturer can exist in developed nations . 
  i 'm asking for some specific examples . 
   her government also resisted opportunities to privatise the dying industries . 
  for instance the workers at tower colliery ( one of the weakest of the supposedly least viable primary industries ) fought tooth and nail to buy their colliery ( and eventually won against both the government and their own union ) . 
  tower ran profitably until it mined out despite being considered a poor mine . 
  i have absolutely zero doubt in my mind that part of her purpose was to break the backs of the unions . 
  i do n't think that was the sole goal , but i would n't be surprised at all . 
  that said , i have n't found much on the arguments or specific actions the government took related to closing tower colliery . 
  interesting though , thanks . 
   she did n't just destroy the financially unviable ones . 
  her target was the unions rather than anything else . 
  which industries do you think qualify as this ? 
   if a union was attached it was destroyed . 
  whether profitable or not . 
  that 's pretty obviously not true . 
  britain still has unionized industries and many were n't targeted . 
  the nhs comes immediately do mind ; thatcher did n't want to privati * z * e it . 
   a constant budget means less real budget . 
  yes , and the budget is n't constant . 
   furthermore now the money goes to banks and debt ; education , health care , unemployment benefits ( but we have more unemployed ) , investment and r&d had really big budget cuts . 
  that 's still hardly austerity . 
   it 's what our politicians call the privatizations and cuts to the social net and workers ' rights , salary and bargaining power , together with the rise in taxes that spending is pretty much exactly what it was in 2008 when the crisis began . 
  slightly higher . 
   no reason they could not have continued , though when you 're subsidizing the hell out of an industry , you have a good amount of opportunity cost : every nickel sunk into it could go towards something that you 'll actually be able to compete with down the road . 
  more than that , miners at the time were striking for * more * in an already unsustainable industry . 
  what you 're asking for is literally `` malinvestment ''  the americans seem to be able to mine coal at a profit , and we import a fair bit of the stuff from the us and russia . 
  we subsidize our coal as well , and almost all of it comes out of red states with weak unions . 
  more than that , we have a massive domestic market not available to the uk at the time . 
   there 's also the argument that unless the subsidy was higher than the economic cost of shutting the mines , which was not close to being zero , then it was a losing proposition . 
  if you 're speaking strictly in terms of economic benefit , there is nothing beneficial about running an industry that can not sustain itself when the alternative ( as was attempted ) is educating the workers to get them into something more sustainable . 
   in so far as she created that vision , perhaps , but the fragility of the banking sector and service economy that she created , as opposed to the resilience of the german model , is quite clear at this point . 
  arguably she could have gone more `` industrial '' , but her predictions about resource extraction were spot on . 
   in this context i do n't particularly care about the rest of the world and what they did , what her influence might have been ; all i know is that i and many in the older generation here see we 've suffered for it yeah , that 's why i said she 's on the wrong side of public opinion , but on the right side of history . 
   why is our water supply owned and run by private foreign companies ? 
  it 's mostly domestically owned . 
  there 's only a couple international companies , and even then they 're mostly just parent companies ( aka they have a uk company paying uk taxes employing uk citizens ) ** domestic ** [ severn trent ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/severn_trent ) - based in coventry , no parent company .
