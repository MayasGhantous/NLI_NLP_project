   maybe you live in an anarchict society and it works for you , but that 's not how it works in most countries . 
  there are rules , permits , etc. 
  ah yes . 
  holding british ski instructors working for a tour group to the same standard as french ski instructors working for a ski school would be anarchy . 
  [ fixed .

   i do n't know how safe it is compared to other capitals , but there are no areas that you should avoid at night . 
  really ? 
  that 's even possible ? 
  do you guys just `` not have crack heads '' or something ? 
  sounded safe until i heard about the cows . 
  what 's it like ? 
  my buddy buys a few new coins every time `` europe '' has to make a significant decision . 
  he 's made 10x what he 's invested so far . 
   thanks for quoting every part of my post other than the one bit you could n't give an answer for , sticks out like a sore thumb and confirms what everyone in this thread thought about you . 
   1 ) it was n't worth replying to , but i will now . 
  2 ) you 've barely actually replied to a single thing i 've said . 
  you latch onto one statement and only reply to that . 
  you do n't even have the actual conviction to respond to a direct question and say whether or not you think you should be able to take 100 % . 
  those in glass houses should not throw stones . 
  you 've clearly and obviously been avoiding the majority of what i said . 
  i 'm not saying millionaire 's do n't work for it , nor am i saying that they 're not wealth creators but we 're not talking about normal circumstances and you do n't seem to realise that it 's a choice between taking the food out of poor children 's mouths , and making a rich person only have $ 2.5 m in his bank account - no brainer to any none-american imo . 
  [ wealth is not a zero sum game you idiot . ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/objectivist/2011/06/14/when-it-comes-to-wealth-creation-there-is-no-pie/ ) . 
  it 's not taking anything from anyone 's mouth . 
  you have a catastrophically poor understanding of how the world works . 
  it 's even more hilarious because you seem to be under the delusion europe agrees with you when your breed of socialism loses in nearly every election in every country . 
   good thing nobody said those things then . 
  here is what i said '' * `` we helped '' is n't a bottomless license to take whatever you want . 
  there has to be a limit . 
  * '' you called all of that `` yank logic '' , which implies that you think yes , it is a bottomless license . 
  when i asked you to actually say it outright , you dodged because you 'd rightly get hammered to the proverbial wall if you said that . 
  but the implication was pretty damn clear . 
   that 's why when the country is in crisis most europeans believe that those with the broadest shoulders should bear the heaviest burden , except in * all * concerned countries , this is the case . 
  they pay more than anyone else , even in the us . 
  most of our total income tax revenue comes from the rich here . 
   because taking away from the poor to give to the rich on the basis that the rich are `` better '' is ridiculous and something that europeans are generally smarter than their american counterparts over . 
  you are seriously an idiot if you think that 's how americans think . 
  i have never met someone who would agree with that statement as a whole ( taking from the poor for the rich especially ) , and few who would agree with even parts of it . 
   i do n't think i 'm ever going to be able to explain to you how a person can only be rich if the society allows it , it can only happen in a world where they are safe , where workers are paid low amounts , where property/stock can be bought and sold , where there is no threat of an army showing up at your door , where his money has value . 
  no shit sherlock . 
  no one is arguing against that . 
   but like i said , you believe that because a millionaire gave up his family ( although i 've never met a single millionaire that was n't a playboy so i 'm not sure where you got that from ) that he should be exempt from tax . 
  1 ) i doubt you know many of them . 
  2 ) no one is saying they should exempt from tax , just that `` well he needed society ! '', 
  has it 's limits on what that person should have to give to society . 
  it has * limits * , not `` it means they should pay no tax '' * ----------------------------- summary : you tried to construct a shitty strawman based on your own pathetic stereotypes . 
  before you act like an arrogant twat to someone who * was * trying to be nice early on , you should probably make sure you 're actually addressing their points and leave your own small minded picture of the world out of it . 
   no , stop being pedantic , do n't take this personally but i 'm not gon na sit here and write an essay to try to explain basic socialism to an american , if you 're really interested then go read up on it then we can chat . 
  stop being an arrogant dick . 
  i 'm personally aware of what socialism is , but europe is also typically not considered socialist beyond a social-democratic streak that most would not even consider actual socialism . 
  true or `` original '' socialism ( worker/government control of the means of production ) is almost entirely extinct . 
  i 'm getting the sense you just do n't want to commit to saying it is right to take 100 % of what someone made . 
   the reason it 's specifically yank logic is because your sentence reads exactly like the `` all poor americans believe that they 're just temporarily embarrassed millionaires '' joke/phrase , and that really shows up your cultural upbringing as a result , since europeans know better/different . 
  that 's not what i said at all . 
  it 's not rooted in the idea that someday everyone will be a millionaire , it 's rooted in the idea that it 's not * right * to take everything ( or almost everything ) that someone worked for ... whether or not you will be in their ranks . 
  `` because i can '' is not a valid reason . 
  some people might ( for example ) forego a family for the sake of building up another aspect of their life . 
  taking the result of that is the same as taking what they gave up without giving them anything in return . 
   all of it . 
  no need to downvote a question . 
  so you believe any support from society means there * is * a bottomless license to take whatever you want ? 
  would that even hold up to 100 % of what the person made ? 
  political discussions get too serious too easily . 
  so imagine me without my pants . 
  can you explain to me which part is yank logic ? 
   dassault is known to be right wing though . 
  the dassault family is even involved in politics , one of them is in congress . 
  they 're very liberal . 
  of course , since they are rich and owner of a defence company ; if it was the us they would be republican . 
  so are a * lot * of business owners . 
  even if leaving is something restricted to the right wing , france could still be in a lot of trouble . 
   the argument is that they only got where they are because of the society they are in . 
  nobody gets anywhere purely by themselves , the whole ' i got here without any help ! ', 
  viewpoint is nonsense . 
  no one gets there * purely * by themselves , but many get there in large part because of the sacrifices and effort they put in . 
  `` we helped '' is n't a bottomless license to take whatever you want . 
  there * has * to be a limit . 
  fuck germany , france is giving europe its * real * bailout . 
  a massive stimulus package of ex-french businesses . 
  bottle service . 
  a nice club can easily run 2000 + just for a table . 
  i 've seen as high as 10k here in the states . 
  i crawl the internet from ~ 15 different countries . 
  big servers , big bandwidth . 
  why do you ask ? 
  i rent servers around europe , and germany has some of the better internet access ( and infrastructure ) out there . 
  nothing tops ovh in france though . 
  `` blown away '' would probably be a better pun ( blow = cocaine ) . 
   44,000 people from somalia , another 44,000 from iraq , another 44,000 from ethiopia , another 44,000 from syria ... and so it gathers ... learn2fearmonger . 
  still less of them combined than there are finns . 
   woah now whats wrong with finland ? 
  just a method of emphasis . 
   i 've never claimed to be a white supremacist you 're a poster in [ / r/niggers , / r/whiterights , and / r/racism ] ( http://metareddit.com/stalk?user=panentheist ) . 
  and as i have quoted you previously : * '' [ when you set up business in a nigger community . . what do you expect ? 
  that they act like civilized , humans ? 
  no ... they 'll act like ghetto porch monkeys and terrorize the business . 
  what he needs to do is put up bulletproof glass , put in metal detectors , and have a intercom system to buzz people in . 
  it 's sad , but that 's the only way to keep animals out of the store when it 's set up in the ghetto .

   i brought up a very valid point no , you actually did n't ( as is always the case ) ... not if you look at any of the statistics .
