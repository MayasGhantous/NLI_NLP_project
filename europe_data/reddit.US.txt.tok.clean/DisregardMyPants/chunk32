   you really think sweden will stay white ? 
  it 's on track to look like somalia . 
  yet again : no , it 's fucking not . 
  sweden has a population of 9,453,000 . 
  it has 43,966 somalians . 
  i doubt math is your strong suit , so i 'll do it for you : sweden 's polution is 0.46 % somalian ... if it was going to become * anything * other than swedish , it would be finnish ( 1.7 % ) or yugoslavian ( 1.66 % ) , but that 's not going to happen either . 
  i swear : if the united states ever starts giving people a proper education in math , it will be the end of white supremacists idiots like you . 
   question ? 
  why is sweden importing so many immigrants from the middle east and africa ? 
  it 's like the white people over there are losing their culture and identity to multi-cultural globalization . 
  * this has absolutely nothing to do with the post * sweden is over [ 86 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_sweden#demographics ) swedish with the largest minority being people from fucking finland . 
  there are only 44,000 people from somalia in the entire damn country . 
  not the first time i 've seen you try to inject your white supremacist bullshit where it does n't belong either . 
   but when they have looked to europe , where germany exercises the decisive influence , they have received what they are told they should be grateful for and things have just got worse . 
  if this is the case , it 's only because they have no fucking clue how bad it could have been without the assistance they got . 
   that 's not exactly the help or solidarity they were hoping for . 
  yeah , not surprising they 'd prefer the kind that does n't make their be any consequences for your actions . 
  most people would prefer that when given the choice . 
  the problem is there * always * is consequences and in the case the only way to keep them off the countries that `` made mistakes '' is to offload their consequences onto those who did n't . 
  they 're statistics about the country 's occupants perception of their country , not perceived statistics . 
  got ta protect the russian oligarchs with money in cyprus . 
   i want to do away with speculation as we have it . 
  that 's a total cop-out . 
  if you make banks have enough in their vaults to pay for every dollar that could potentially be withdrawn , you end lending , mortgages and credit . 
  there 's not 2 ways about this . 
  which is more important to you ? 
  that a bank be able to handle a bank run cashing everyone out 100 % or that a bank be able to give credit and loans to people who need them ? 
  so you want to do away with lending and credit ? 
  plus taking away the children of gypsies has been common in the past . 
  it 's happened multiple places in multiple centuries . 
  poe 's law i guess . 
  for most countries that 's actually not terrible . 
  2007 ( or any year before it ) was pretty great . 
   what makes you say google does n't care about its single biggest market besides the usa ? 
  european non-english traffic is worth considerably less than english speaking european traffic or united states based traffic . 
  your language leaks the language you speak , your ip leaks your country and google 's ads are priced accordingly . 
  i 'm sure they care , but it 's probably not a top priority . 
   there 's a lot of anglocentricism in anglosaxon companies however , they do still realise that there are other non anglosaxon markets . 
  google 's first market was the us and then probably fellow english speaking countries . 
  it 's also worth noting that when it comes to paid ads , english speaking traffic is the most expensive . 
  generally speaking : australia  united states  united kingdom  ireland  new zealand . 
  prepare to be liberated britain !, 
  you have moved into what we consider `` manifest destiny '' territory . 
   you have got to be kidding ... 
  they were not `` killed , enslaved or mutilated '' when they were allowed to to come to mary theresa 's domain . 
  after previous rulers had failed to banish the gypsies ( and yes , they tried ) maria theresa [ forbade marriages between gypsies and stole their children away from them ] ( http://ling.uni-graz.at/~rombase/cgi-bin/art.cgi?src=data/hist/modern/maria.en.xml )  yes , it was expected that their tribal laws are not in place anymore ( eg . 
  it is unacceptable that if you 're not roma it 's ok to steal from you ) . 
  is this racist ? 
  come on ... what does this have to do with the nazis who forcefully sterilized them ? 
  i 'm saying that there 's rarely if ever been an extended period of time in which they were actually encouraged to integrate and were allowed to . 
  in the past `` integration '' meant `` we take your children and do n't allow you to move anywhere '' ( source : [ romani people : forced assimilation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people#forced_assimilation ) )  whatever do you mean `` forcibly segregated '' in the 2000s ? 
  your hyperbole is ridiculous regarding `` burnt down villages '' , where did that happen ? 
  can you link to any sources in the eu ? 
  [ here 's a report from amnesty international about it ] ( http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/governments-urged-end-segregation-roma-schools-after-european-court-rules-against-hungary-2013 - ) referring to [ hungary ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21247053 ) , [ romania ] ( http://www.romania-insider.com/new-regional-initiative-tackling-roma-segregation-in-schools-kicks-off-in-bucharest/76114/ ) , [ czech republic ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8456882.stm ) , [ greece ] ( http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/webservices/content/pdf/003-4192106-4967450 ) , [ croatia ] ( http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=3569 ) and slovakia . 
  please note that each country is linked to a more specific report . 
   the fact that we 're having this discussion is evidence enough that there 's no state level discrimination - more like affirmative action in most eu countries ... 
  without the history that would demand it . 
  at least i hope that you 're not trying to draw a parallel to african americans and gypsies ... that would be the most ridiculous hypothesis of the 21st century . 
  the point is that * it takes time * and it 's only very , very recently you can reasonably expect the clock to start ticking . 
  if you win 20 % + every generation you 're still talking damn near a century for complete integration . 
   without the history that would demand it . 
  this ca n't even be serious . 
  i just showed you a huge number of examples of discrimination and abuse across multiple centuries and there 's a lot more where that came from . 
  it 's only in recent years that europe has even * attempted * to properly integrate the roma , and even then ( as my examples show ) there were some serious flaws . 
   for eu citizens going to us universities ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  yeah , there 's still a fairly large amount . 
  that said , i was n't sure if notangelamerkel was an american making a point about the us university system in general , or if they were making a point specifically regarding eu citizens . 
   from the 12th century they were allowed in some european countries . 
  one thing in common : it never worked . 
  so whatever do you mean by how fast do you expect them to integrate ? 
  you 've got to be kidding . 
  the 12th century ? 
  they 'd be allowed * some * places * some * of the time , but then every few years someone would decide to kill , enslave , or mutilate them . 
  by 1660s [ sixteen different countries outlawed the roma ] ( http://ethosmagonline.com/archives/8502 ) , many executing them on sight . 
  the swiss even hunted them for sport . 
  in the 1700s bohemia was branding , cutting off the ears of , then hanging them . 
  austria was not allowing them to marry , and they were enslaved by the romanians . 
  moving forward there 's obviously the holocaust ( in which huge numbers died ) but a large number of countries inbetween undergoing similar deportation/mutilation efforts . 
  in the 1940s they were sterilized in the czech republic , slovakia , germany , norway , sweden and switzerland . 
  in the 1960s they were effectively outlawed from a large number of establishments in the uk ( `` no blacks , no dogs , no gypsies '' ) in the 2000s they were forcibly segregated in many countries , including the czech republic , hungary , bulgaria , denmark , and romania . 
  most forced them into `` special education '' programs based on their background . 
  in recent years they 've had their villages burnt down and been kicked out of numerous countries across eastern europe as well . 
  ----------------------------------- this is just a * small * random smattering of all the things european countries have done to them . 
  it 's honestly downright bizarre that someone would claim they 've been permitted to integrate after the 1200s . 
  they 've been treated like shit for centuries . 
   but if you 're dirt poor and work your ass off to win scholarships , you go where they let you live like a human being and not as some professor 's coffee-maker slave . 
  true story . 
  there 's actually a * huge * amount of financial aide and scholarships . 
  additionally there 's drastically reduced tuition for people from inside the state . 
  if you 're dirt poor , you also qualify for some hefty fafsa aid which can pay a good deal of the tuition . 
  beyond that there 's a lot of more affordable education options as well that are in the middle or lower tier . 
  on the lowest end ( community college ) you 're paying practically nothing . 
   what a surprise ... they do n't want to integrate anywhere . 
  they want to parasite on others , it 's their lifestyle . 
  how fast do you expect them to ? 
  until not so long ago they were persecuted ( or killed ) damn near everywhere and had been for centuries . 
  if you can convince 20 % of the total potential roma population to abandon their lifestyle every generation ( which is n't bad ) it would still take 5 generations ( or ~ 80 years ) before it 's gone . 
  people have incredibly unreasonable expectations of these people . 
  it 's been an very short period of time since they were even really allowed or encouraged to integrate .
