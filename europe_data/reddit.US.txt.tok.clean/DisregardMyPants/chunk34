  the fines may be worth preserving an active browser monopoly , but they 're certainly not worth a few extra users of free software that turns no revenue for ms. 
  the standard for `` malicious program '' is much higher for android . 
  if pc programs did half the shit android ones do they would be called viruses . 
   according to the tax bought microsoft 's irish subsidiary namely the valuable rights too cheaply by the danish subsidiary . 
  on the way microsoft could move large values of denmark without values were taxed legally in this country , believes tax . 
  ah yes , the old `` you bought your intellectual property too cheap , and because of that paid too little '' argument for increased taxes . 
  good luck , it ai n't gon na happen . 
   microsoft has long attracted the attention of tax authorities worldwide . 
  the company 's ingenious construction of affiliated companies makes it relatively easy for the group to channel profits from the various subsidiaries for tax havens , where there are virtually no paid corporation tax . 
  and this is why it 's not going to happen . 
  they did n't set it up to be * almost * legal or * sort of * legal , they set it up to be ingeniously legal . 
   frankly if i was leading a country and pharmaceutical companies would not sell me the medicine my population needed at the price we could afford greece has the cheapest medicine in europe . 
  the choices are rarely between austerity and no austerity . 
  the choices are between austerity and `` no one loans you money '' - which by default would implement an unstructured austerity . 
  the money has to come from somewhere , and no one will loan without a reasonable chance they will be paid back . 
  interest is a representation of the risk that they will * not * be paid back . 
  so when a country gets to the point where austerity is recommended , they are generally approaching the point where interest rates would get so high they can not take them . 
  the alternative to austerity is not `` keep spending merrily '' , the alternative is `` get no loans and become completely fucked '' . 
  i 'd probably be in texas if austin 's startup scene was in full swing when i started the company like it is now . 
  programmers ( which we need ) are just drawn to cali , so it 's a great talent pool . 
  nowadays there 's enough in texas to suffice , but i do n't want to make everyone move . 
   just out of curiousity , is that 33 % what is taken out of your paycheck ( i.e. 
  before you get your returns ) or is that your effective tax rate after you have filed your taxes ( including deductions and returns ) . 
  i too live in the us , but my effective federal taxes were 12.5 % . 
  i make $ 70k/year , so i do n't know if you 're in a different bracket than me . 
  i believe it 's what is taken out , but to be honest i 'm not 100 % positive . 
  i run the business , so i 'm effectively taxed out of both sides . 
  i rarely bother to distinguish which side is eating my money . 
  i hate payday . 
   i make $ 70k/year , so i do n't know if you 're in a different bracket than me . 
  i 'm about the same . 
   side note : good god california has high taxes , i knew they were high but not that high . 
  i just moved to michigan and the state taxes here are about 3 % . 
  they 're insane . 
  top 3 in the nation for nearly every category aside from property tax , and that 's just because the courts ruled there 's some constitutional issue with raising it too high ... and people here * still * insist that the fact they ca n't raise property tax is responsible for the downfall of the state 's budget . 
  it 's insane . 
  i live in california . 
  i pay ~ 33 % federal +10 % state . 
  so we 're not far behind . 
  if you want low taxes it 's workable , but you ca n't have the type of safety nets that people want in europe . 
   dikes . 
  bloody dikes . 
  dikes in disrepair . 
  to me , from a country in which `` behind the dike '' means the land side , as unimaginable as socialism to the tea party . 
  we do n't have very many of those . 
  * texas ( texas city vs galveston bay ) - last redone a few years ago after hurricane ike . 
  * texas ( galveston sea wall ) * seattle , wa ( alaskan way seawall ) * florida ( lake okeechobee ) * new orleans ( oops ! ), 
  that 's it . 
   and what angela merkel said today is grave and false . 
  care to explain what exactly is false ? 
   yeah , but what the `` austerity-opponents '' want is free loans to countries like greece so that they can use it for big stimulus programs to get their economy going again . 
  the problem always being that the `` free loans '' have to come from somewhere , that `` somewhere '' * always * needs to expect they 'll get their money back , and the loans are never free because there 's risk involved . 
  i just ca n't believe `` we want more free money whether or not we 're likely to pay it back '' has become something of a political warcry . 
   so the idea is killing 2/10 of them because otherwise 8/10 of them would be dead ? 
  do you have any idea how are they living ? 
  do you have any idea how many would be dead * without * austerity ? 
  if the funds just suddenly dried up ? 
  austerity is the only thing allowing greece to get * any money at all * . 
  it is a way to avoid the super-turbo-austerity that comes with all loans suddenly being cut off . 
   germany is the one who is childlike , refusing to acknowledge what is now obvious , austerity has failed . 
  how many more trimesters of negative growth will europe need before we change course ? 
  this is absurd . 
  austerity ( especially in cases like greece ) is just a structured way to use less money as an alternative to simply running out and having * everything * turn off . 
  it gives people enough confidence to loan to you at a workable rate . 
  without that confidence , you ca n't get loans . 
  without loans , everything grinds to a halt . 
  austerity implemented intentionally is far better than the `` austerity '' that would be implemented without it . 
  greece for example would have received no money at all was it not for austerity because no one thought they 'd be paid back . 
   as you 're accepting the new mod-ship on behalf of the usa . 
  does n't red indicate even deeper sins than that of any black colour ? 
  [ 1 ] god has always marked those who are so sinful they must be removed from the land to gain his favor with red . 
  this is why we fought the british ( red coats ) , the indians , and the communists . 
   http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/americas-mid-20th-century-infrastructure/ amtrak is not publicly owned and neither are most of the railways it has to slow down on . 
  taxes have nothing to do with it . 
   http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/08/infrastructure fta : * this seems more probable , based on the fact that the massachusetts department of transportation 's accelerated bridge program is currently replacing 75 such bridges , and plans to start on 25 more shortly ; overall , they expect to replace or repair 200 of the state 's 539 structurally-deficient bridges through 2016 . 
  * his complaint is mostly about the lack of federal subsidies to speed up the work that is actually getting done as is . 
   http://www.businessinsider.com/us-infrastructure-behind-developed-world-2013-1 translation : `` we do n't do light rail and other places do '' . 
  ----------------------------------------- those are all a bit `` meh '' . 
  most roads in urban or suburban areas are just fine , as are our freeways and airports . 
  the only infrastructure seriously in need of replacing is the stuff idefix24 identified .

   do you have an immediate reaction to the word `` islam '' ? 
  how does it make you feel ? 
  where islam goes , shawarma sandwiches will surely follow . 
  god created shawarma on the ninth day . 
   what does the skin colour tell us about a person ? 
  acts of righteousness and sins amass in the dermis layer of the human body . 
  sins represent themselves as brown , with mortal sins representing themselves as a darker shade of brown .

  i accept your nominations at the urging of god , and accept / r/europe as my manifest destiny and future sphere of influence . 
   and unfortunately the flip-side of that is that your basic services and infrastructure are crumbling and falling apart :( nah , they 're not that bad . 
  i appreciate your concern though . 
   the 75 % tax has been torpedoed btw , by the constitutional court . 
  but the fact that they attempted it ( and damn near succeeded ) still factors into how investors and businesses perceive france . 
  i tried to file my own taxes once or twice and took significant time and research to do it .
