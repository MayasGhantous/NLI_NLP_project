  if that 's the goal , this will be completely ineffective . 
  if you see a woman on a board , you 'll just think `` well , guess they had to meet the quota '' , not `` this woman must be effective if she got this role '' . 
  i doubt other board member would take women seriously either if they know they got the job because of their gender . 
  also our `` rights '' in this country are negative rights , not positive rights . 
  that means they are restrictions on government and the legislature rather than a concept that must be respected by private individuals or companies . 
  ie : we are n't given free speech , congress is just prohibited from making laws that would alter the naturally existing condition of free speech . 
   `` do n't touch the cap . 
  hey !,

  we clear ? 
  hey !, 
  hey !, 
  look at me !,

  do n't touch the cap . 
  hey !,

  alright . 
  alright . 
  just do n't touch it . 
  i warned ya . '', 
  `` but do n't expect to get * your * ` rebate ' '', 
   you have missed the `` at every step '' part . 
  essentially hollande just wants everyone to keep paying the huge agricultural subsidies and to do it with a smile on their face . 
   well when france threatened to veto over farm subsidies not an eyebrow was raised . 
  but have n't you heard of ** food security ** ? 
  we even put ** security ** in the phrase !, 
  that makes it more important than anything else , do n't know you know that ? 
   no , it 's not about white guilt . 
  it 's not like he used / r/whiterights as a way to discredit me and it 's not like you 're defending that whites should forfeit a natural advantage that comes from being a native and living amongst their race just so that non-whites can have an easier time . 
  / s / r/whiterights can not be defended by saying you `` have no white guilt '' . 
  neither can your position . 
  white guilt is completely irrelevant to anything posted in this thread . 
   you dumb twat , our ancestors worked hard so that we would have an advantage , why should non-whites who just recently arrived expect to be treated equally as the descendants of those who built this godamn place ? 
  my ancestors worked to establish a foundation for their family on which we could build ( ie : money , education , proper values ) , not for racial supremacy or to establish a structure that makes life shitty for brown people . 
   i 'll care more about those who are more alike me than some random with whom i share no common ancestor in the last thousand years , if you think that 's unfair and your jimmies are rustled by it , then too bad . 
  the color of someone 's skin does n't really have a whole lot to do with how `` alike '' i am to someone . 
  especially with the inbred hicks that make up our white nationalist movement in this country , i 'm much more likely to have something in common with immigrants who move here ... like the desire to get ahead by your skills and what you have to offer rather than some misguided sense of kinship based on skin pigment . 
  allow me to translate this article from french for you guys . 
   hollande warns cameron not to hijack eu summit translation : we do not want to talk about our subsidies and if that happens nothing will be accomplished . 
   in his address to the european parliament , mr hollande said the 2014-2020 eu budget of some $ 1 trillion ( # 860.8 bn ) was open to some savings but insisted the leaders at thursday 's summit should not compromise innovation and shared sectors like farming . 
  translation : france still wants their * massive * farming subsidies . 
  they can cut small things as long as it does n't hurt france . 
   in several remarks that could be seen as targeting mr cameron , mr hollande said `` there are those who want to see cuts , others - possibly the same , who want guarantees on their own rebate '' . 
  translation : if we give other countries `` rebates '' , we would have to cut into france 's own `` rebate '' - yet again , agricultural subsidies . 
  as always , i 'm amazed hollande can say these things with a straight face . 
  `` white guilt '' ? 
  this is n't a question of white guilt . 
  no one is trying to give an advantage to foreigners * over * whites , they want non-whites to have an * equal * chance . 
  dumb fuck . 
  they 're barely doing any controlling . 
  aside from relatively rare domain seizures ( that only impact a * few * tlds ) it 's pretty well left alone . 
  i do n't think there 's many countries that would be as hands off as the us has been . 
  the worst case scenario so far with us control is you have to get something other than a . com domain . 
  that 's not bad all things considered . 
  given the level of control middle eastern countries , china , and russia want and the somewhat troublesome free speech restrictions many european countries support , i feel quite comfortable with it in us hands . 
   america subsidizes their own agriculture . 
  1 ) i do n't support that either . 
  2 ) we support * our own * agriculture , we do n't use funds from other nations or redirect funds intended for international bodies to our own agriculture . 
   you 're a troll . 
  ah yes . 
  i must agree with my own government . 
  after all , what good ` murican does n't ? 
   but since every ( developped ) nation does it , not having subsidies would be an disadvantage towards the others . 
  that 's still an overall advantage , and part of what serves to crush local economies in less-developed countries that previously relied on agriculture . 
  it 's also worth noting that most countries subsidize their * own * industries instead of re-routing the funds from their international commitments to do it . 
   i 'm not disputing the fact that france receives the biggest cap subsidies , but considering we have the biggest agricultural land area of all eu countries , that 's only logical . 
  yes , france tries to get subsidies for the things it can get the most subsidies for . 
  just like oil companies try to get oil subsidies . 
  it is entirely self involved , and you will never see france pressuring for a subsidy of something it wo n't be the beneficiary of . 
   i hope you do understand that france has the most farmed land in the eu , several times more than the uk and almost as much as germany and poland combined . 
  yes , which is why their position on the subsidy is self-serving . 
  it 'd be one thing if say - portugal - was saying that it 's important to have agriculture subsidized for `` food security '' ( what i 've seen the french call it ) , but it 's not . 
  it 's the primary beneficiary . 
  it 's little different than banks calling for the banks to be bailed out , or oil companies calling for oil subsidies . 
   in recent times france has also become a net contributor to the eu , so i would n't say that they 're getting more back by contributing this way , since like you 've said , per capita , other countries are getting more . 
  they would be contributing about the same with or without the subsidies . 
  this is just a way to claw back some of the funds they kick into the eu . 
  it 's a way for the country to benefit off of what would otherwise be spread outside of france . 
   although the cap is criticized intensively over here , it is ensuring food security for the eu and it is a form of protectionism so that eu farmers do n't go out of business while also ensuring a level playing field when it comes to farming practices , animal welfare and environmental protection . 
  subsidies make a playing field * unequal * . 
  they give one nation ( or in most cases select companies from that nation ) an advantage over the others . 
   really ? 
  can you provide a quote or did you just make that up ? 
  france supports the cap but the cap applies to all countries in the eu . 
  cap applies around the eu , but france is the primary beneficiary . 
  [ more information ] ( http://www.ecpa.eu/information-page/agriculture-today/common-agricultural-policy-cap )  ** france is -- and always has been -- the largest recipient of cap funds ( 20 % of the total in 2006 ) ** , with spain , germany , italy and the uk all also receiving significant amounts ( two-thirds of the total between these five countries ) . 
  although getting smaller absolute amounts , greece and ireland receive the largest per capita payments . 
  or for [ more on their efforts ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/specialreport-budget/special-report-france-wins-round-news-506285 )  but a strong lobbying campaign led by paris -- the cap 's single biggest beneficiary -- seems to have paid off . 
   last week , the european commission tabled proposals for the eu 's 2014-2020 budget which largely leave current farm funding untouched . 
  but it is france belief that the cap is in the eu interest ( or else why would n't we just have our own subsidies scheme ? ), 
  because the cost of the eu is a cost you would have to have anyways , this is just a way to get more back from that cost . 
  you 'll note that france is noticeably less excited about subsidizing the agricultural production of * other * countries . 
   national interests , he said in strasbourg , risked taking precedence over the interests of the eu . 
  [ . . ]  `` national interest is overtaking the european interest , '' he said . 
  alright , that makes sense in the eu . 
   `` an agricultural policy that permits a precious industry to be sustained '' and `` the environment to be respected '' ah !, 
  so resisting putting national priorities over those of the eu is important ... unless the issue at hand is french agricultural subsidies . 
  then france 's interests are more important than the whole of the eu .
