  there 's a * reason * most countries wo n't let you marry and will forgive criminal records from people that age . 
  because they 're monumentally stupid ... 
  i do n't think society should be imposing lifelong restrictions on a 15 year old because of something stupid they did . 
  ahhhh ok . you 're right . 
  i 'll remove the comment . 
  ok carry on . 
   a people does n't need a piece of paper to protect their own . 
  for fuck 's sake . 
  ** russians were never in danger in ukraine ** . 
  say it with me folks !, 
  ** russians were never in danger in ukraine ** . 
  no , but they do care about maintaining a sphere of influence . 
  having control of replacement parts , upgrades , etc is a way to assert control over a country . 
  bulgaria is n't just stepping away from russian planes , it 's stepping away from russia . 
  business : hahahahahahahahaha ---------------- bust seriously : several of hollande 's attempted policies did n't even attempt to make an actual difference ( like the 75 % tax ) ... they were attempts to send a message to the wealthy and business community . 
  looks like that message was received loud and clear . 
  finally , russia delivers on quality of life improvements to it 's satellite states !, 
   there should always be an investigation after a significant industrial accident there was . 
  they concluded it 's human error , and that it was diluted enough to not be dangerous . 
   saying `` dude this is europe , of course shit 's safe , '' does n't cut it . 
  did n't say that . 
  i said `` of course it 's been inspected '' , because what you were recommending was inspections . 
   obviously something unsafe happened if 45 liters of a pathogen solution got into a river . 
  ... yes . 
  and they looked into it . 
   there are various ways to handle the situation . 
  the government could inspect their facility to see if their safety precautions are adequate , for example . 
  homie this is europe . 
  their facilities are * definitely * fucking inspected already . 
   i feel as if at a round table a bunch of european politicians were having a discussion about what makes america work and they somehow got to the conclusion that it was diversity . 
   i always thought it was more complicated than that ... when our nation was becoming populated , it was * really fucking hard to get here * . 
  anyone who made it here was seeking something better , and willing to sacrifice practically everything ( their family , their culture , etc ) to make that happen . 
   i 'll toss discredit on any so-called expert or politician who uses the term islamophobia . 
  one should be free to criticize islam without having to be associated with racist ideology , and that 's what i 'll do . 
   i think it 's worth pointing out that such a thing * does * exist . 
  there * are * people who 's problem largely comes down to `` different than us '' . 
  there 's also legitimate criticism though , and those criticisms should be heard as well . 
   honesty , considering the size of the city and the number of marines would they be a significant amount of the population ? 
  i mean , that city has millions of people . 
  and it 's in california for christ sake . 
  by the coast/downtown ? 
  yes , absolutely . 
  san diego has a total of 1.37 million people , and around 250,000 of them are military . 
  at * least * half of them are married , so military families make up ~ 325,000 people . 
  subtract minors from that 1.37 million and add in the retired veterans and the number is * huge * . 
  they 're also not distributed evenly , and cluster close to the coast in north county and downtown . 
  so in certain areas it 's pretty intense . 
  one of the cities was san diego - astronomical marine population , huge number of imports from the south ( who are frequently in the military ) . 
  1 suburb , 2 college towns , 1 beach town , 2 cities . 
  michigan and california . 
   oh come on ... you have to be joking , right ? 
  i live in the us , i 'm openly atheist , and i 've never felt discriminated against . 
  he 's either full of shit or living in the deep south . 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about , north korea is best korea . 
  oh , well as long as there 's a country worse than you everything 's fine . 
  ... but please . 
  do n't go to north florida . 
   ukraine has racked up a 5 billion dollar + debt and is in no position to pay it back . 
  try going months and months without paying your electricity or internet or w/e bill and see how long it 'll take for it to get shut off . 
  and russia took crimea , which is worth far , far more than ukraine 's debt . 
  it 's like securing a loan with your car , but having them take your house instead . 
  part of my job is working with tablets and phones - dozens of them , running hard , constantly . 
  apple 's lightning cable is far , far more reliable than microusb . 
  the inside will bend up or down , i 've even seen them outright rip the middle piece out . 
   benefit ? 
  what benefit ? 
   a strong defensive alliance that discourages actual conflict . 
   see that 's the very issue : the us is assuming there 's some benefit in all their squandering . 
  all their , and specifically also your , bitching pivots on it , and every time people start to justify the assumption they 're talking bullshit talking points . 
  well , we have n't had a world war in a bit , even through some of the most intense cold wars history has known . 
  once again : if you do n't think there 's a benefit , you do n't have to be a part of it . 
  good one . 
  we were n't even properly sovereign when we joined . 
  this is n't a street gang . 
  you can leave ... 
   well , if europe did n't agree there 'd be even more bitching from the us . 
  so we agreed . 
   ... it 's not a question of bitching . 
  it 's a question of many countries all spending significant parts of their income for the mutual benefit of other countries . 
  the way each country makes sure it 's not being shafted is that the other countries spend similar proportions . 
  not paying your percent puts into question the logic by which each other nation justifies putting in their percent . 
  it weakens literally the whole alliance when you do n't live up to your obligations . 
  no one made you be a part of nato , they just requested you put the same percent of your income in as everyone else . 
   why ? 
  it 's not binding in any way . 
  it 's advisory . 
  if the us want to make it binding , let them try . 
  it 's not binding , but no one is talking about literally forcing you to spend that much . 
  it is still however what each country agreed they 'd spend . 
  just because it 's not binding does n't mean it 's not real . 
   percentage of gdp is a hilariously bad way to measure defence capability . 
  do you really think germany spending 2 % and haiti spending 2 % would result in the same defence capability ? 
  nato does n't request absolute equal contribution though . 
  just proportional equality . 
   the nato can defend itself plenty without spending 2 % . 
  what 's less sure is how much power can be projected at the other side of the globe with sane defence budgets , and that 's why us hawks always push that talking point . 
  us hawks push that percent because that 's the percent europe agreed to . 
  if you do n't like it , renegotiate . 
  do n't just quietly fail to live up to the agreement . 
   you seriously think canada ' s prosperity is due to that extra .5 % of gdp they save by not fully paying for their military protection ?
