  same thing in san francisco . 
  it 's getting absurd . 
  i live in * not * a nice area and pay $ 2500 for a one bedroom . 
  * and * it will go up soon . 
  the us navy has the second largest air force in the world . 
  behind the us air force . 
  it kind of comes with the territory of having ass tons of carriers and whatnot . 
   i have n't seen anything connecting them to russia . 
  there 's been an incredible amount of information connecting them to russia , but do n't take my word for it . 
  take * their * word for it : [ `` now russia helps us , everyone knows . 
  it is impossible to hide . 
  it is a fact '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zjbyxf6yi0#t=2m22s ), 
  if they went you * know * russia would start talking about ukraine in the ceremony/speeches , trying to draw a connection between the two . 
  great way to humiliate western leaders and win points at home . 
  do n't forget webcam girls . 
  they have been connected a trillion ways by now . 
  even the fighters on the ground often admit it . 
  no one who is not already convinced will be . 
  * this * is why people did n't want to give the separatists any land at all . 
  they 're just going to use it as a base to launch attacks everywhere else . 
   this did n't happen , i 'm sure you can find plans for a nazi invasion of britain , america and jupiter . 
  1 ) it was n't just `` a '' plan , it went through many revisions , all of which came back with death tolls higher than germany wanted . 
  2 ) it was real enough that [ switzerland mobilized * their entire country * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/switzerland_during_the_world_wars#world_war_ii ) to prepare for it . 
  3 ) [ the most commonly given reasons for no invasion ] ( http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/switzerland-second-world-war-ii.html ) were swiss defense policy and the inability of tanks to traverse the alps ... not that there was no value . 
   you 're completely delusional if you think that switzerland has n't been invaded because its citizens have guns . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  not just `` guns '' - but people educated in their use and trained by the military . 
  the entire purpose of their `` militia '' styled defense policy was to deter invaders and rapidly respond ( after an initial retreat into the alps and the destruction of infrastructure ) in the case of an invasion . 
  the germans expected to take ~ 200,000 casualties if they invaded switzerland . 
  ps : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_tannenbaum#german_plans_for_nazi_rule_in_switzerland, 
   switzerland is surrounded by the fucking alps and he did n't invade neutral countries that had no immediate benefit to him like sweden or switzerland it 's a huge stretch to say there would be no benefit to him having taken switzerland , especially given how incompetent mussolini was . 
  he could * easily * have ended up with an exposed southern front when italy fell that would have put the allies within spitting distance from munich . 
   switzerland was n't invaded in either of the world wars because of its neutral stance and geographical location not because of an armed population hitler did not give 2 flying fucks if you were neutral . 
  he invaded * allies * . 
  that 's kind of my point . 
  yes , who could forget that time the entire swiss population was wiped out . 
   what ` cha need guns in civilized countries for ? 
  we 're out of the jungle . 
  depends how close to the russian border you are . 
  a well armed populace does have drawbacks , but it 's a hell of an incentive to not occupy/annex a country . 
  it does matter , to an extent . 
  the idea is that the closer you are to your potential target , the less chance there is for a response . 
  that said , the largest retaliation to russia would come from the us , not europe . 
  so for them ? 
  it barely , * barely * matters . 
   please , you take every single chance you can to talk about how estonian style military is better than latvian , despite the fact that you do n't appear to know anything about it . 
  ... he did n't bring up latvia ? 
  chicago style pizza . 
  mmmmmm . 
  [ i assume this is sacrilegious as well ? 
  ] ( http://backontheboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/little-star-pizza.jpg ), 
   also , of course kissinger said that . 
  kissinger 's the closest thing america has to a putin . 
  at least putin 's bullshit is n't handwaived away as `` realpolitik . '', 
  kissinger is a product of the cold war . 
  it 's not surprising he still views everything through the same lens . 
   this could be seen as the first in series of steps into larger euro integration . 
  it starts with a trade agreement and before you know it the country is part of nato . 
  sort of the same thing happened with the baltics . 
  1 ) that would be 20 + years down the road . 
  2 ) it still allows us to throw out the false equivalencies . 
  if mexico made a trade agreement with russia , we would not annex baja . 
   this i do n't understand , nato was n't even remotely associated with the raison d'etre for maidan , it was all about the eu deal . 
  i feel like that gets lost so often . 
  this was about a fucking * trade agreement * . 
  if you remember that fact , all the false equivalencies about expansion , war , etc go out the window . 
  no one in the west would annex territory and create a civil war over a fucking trade agreement . 
  i do vote , and follow things close enough to do so properly . 
  yeah . 
  probably not my best word choice . 
  really what i meant is `` not italy , france , germany , uk '' - countries that are relatively big and well represented over here . 
  what can i say : it 's pretty damn good banter . 
   that would be my face . 
  it 's seriously awesome . 
  especially with the more obscure countries like hungary or estonia where the people can have been here * months * and not met anyone who knows much of anything . 
   well , no offense , but i think you should look at your ancestry if you want to experience our glorious european teasing . 
  in order of percent : romanian , english , german , irish , french , scottish , african ( the english guy got down with a slave ) . 
  i 'm afraid i 'm `` from '' too many countries . 
  i 'd end up making fun of myself . 
  the greeks maybe ? 
  [ they have actually dropped the fat bomb on us ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/p\u0105czki ) . 
  i have many fond memories of fat tuesday in detroit , and many less fond memories of the trip to the bathroom after . 
   romanians and hungarians ? 
  what ? 
  it 's our way of showing love for eachother , come on . 
  i even have a hungarian friend i have n't spoken to since highschool ( do n't judge , i 'm from the south ) . 
  yeah , i like that about you guys . 
  more generically : a lot of countries have a long , bloody past with eachother ( or in some cases simple rivalries ) and can joke about it . 
  we do n't get that here . 
  most people do n't identify * too * strongly with a state so it 's not the same and we ca n't make fun of mexico because of racial tensions and imbalance between the two countries . 
  canada is similar i guess , but that 's it . 
  and even then only if you 're from the north . 
  much to my girlfriends dismay , i do . 
  team poland won me over with their butter churning and i 'll never look back . 
  1 ) i absolutely hate our politics and have no interest in them . 
  world events are far more interesting to me , and european world events are the most interesting of the bunch to me . 
  2 ) it 's really interesting to see the banter between the countries . 
  romanians/hungary , british/french , etc. 
  i 'm aware it 's mostly in jest , but it 's still a great window into the countries . 
  3 ) all countries involved have a lot longer history than us , it 's a fascinating history lesson from a lot of different perspectives : how estonia/poland perceive the ussr , how britain perceives it 's colonial past , etc.
