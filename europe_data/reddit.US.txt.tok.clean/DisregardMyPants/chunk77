  it 's the false narrative that gets to me : all these * unreasonable * people expected obama to do what he said ( while falsely implying they 're upset about things he did n't ) , then all the * unreasonable * republicans made it impossible to function ( during a democratic supermajority ) , then list a few small token issues that are tiny in comparison to the missteps . 
  it 's bs . 
   i 'm ashamed of the republicans , but the democrats are a decent party . 
  yeah , they lie and * then * behave like the republicans . 
  the deception is an important step in making me feel like my vote was for someone good . 
   the original budweiser is czech . 
  you 're copying them . 
  also their beer is a lot better then yours . 
  yes , american budweiser is piss . 
  that 's why the name choice was unfortunate . 
  does n't really matter who was first , the crappiness of american budweiser will have a negative impact on czech budweiser 's brand . 
  that is an unfortunate choice of names ( assuming their beer is any good ) . 
  fact : we actually have good craft brews . 
  we drink them , pee the remnants into bottles , slap a `` budweiser '' label on it , then sell it to europeans . 
  i see it as a way to provide a service that could n't be provided otherwise . 
  we 'd either have to charge $ xx , xxx per license or the user would need a several thousand dollar per month infrastructure + employees to monitor it if we were n't doing it as a service . 
   if i am going to buy software , i want the actual files , on my computer . 
  this allows me control over the application in many ways . 
  well , not everything is 100 % client side . 
  many require significant resources to keep everything running . 
  in our case the clients only see half the software - for viewing the data collected by the other half of the software . 
  the only way we can keep everything on our end running ( while keeping the product within a reasonable price range ) is by making sure we have a certain amount of cash coming in every month . 
  just putting it in perspective a bit . 
  i run a software as a service business . 
  why do you feel it 's bad ? 
   all issues the companies will have to deal with . 
  the 3 most likely ways this will go down : 1 ) they `` deal with it '' by forcing the user to prove that it 's been deleted before allowing the transfer ( almost impossible , puts the onus on the user ) 2 ) they `` deal with it '' by adding a * lot * of drm that let 's them definitively kill a unique installation of the software . 
  3 ) everything possible moves to become a `` software as a service '' model where you 're paying for a membership that allows you to use the software , not the software itself . 
  from the faq :  `` you are pretending to swedish feminists who prioritize very strange in terms of women 's rights ''  we think it is macho guys who refuse to sit properly which gives priority to wonder what the women 's rights . 
  just because there is a wide range of gender issues means it 's not that you can not alter even that which seems small in comparison ? 
  the simpler to do something about , how we think . 
  -------------------  `` assuming that this page is for fun . '', 
   no , we are completely serious . 
   you watch too many movies , google would have to play ball for that to work properly , plain and simple . 
  well , [ there 's a reasonable chance they do play ball ] ( http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2175369/google-nsa-relationship-secrecy-continues-despite-courts-efforts ) , but no . 
  the nsa is huge ( larger than either the cia or fbi by a long shot ) and very much technically adept . 
  as-is they log most internet communication in the us , including [ almost every e-mail ] ( http://www.alternet.org/rights/155084/whistleblower%3a_the_nsa_is_lying_--_the_u.s._government_has_copies_of_most_of_your_emails/ ) . 
  every time i hear about something the nsa has done ( which is rarely ) it blows my mind from a technological perspective . 
   i agree with all that , but the uk is a little bit more desperate in regards to that special friendship . 
  the uk bends over a lot more then other nations . 
  many nations are okay with being just a neutral sort of ally , the uk seems to want the title of `` friend '' . 
  we are a lot more interlinked with the uk though : via the [ ukusa agreement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukusa_agreement ) they get extensive access to our intelligence , we share surveillance facilities [ ( see sigint ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:menwith-hill-radomes.jpg ) . 
  we do n't cooperate with most countries like that . 
   what exactly is that hold that the us has over the uk , and what does the uk get out of it . 
  the british go as far as to delude themselves and become sentimental about the benefits of that special friendship because they cant face the truth . 
  i think you 're a bit pessimistic about that . 
  the uk really is held in special esteem by most americans . 
  i do n't think we would go to war ( edit : unilaterally ) if poland , columbia or portugal were threatened ( i 'm sure we 'd issue a sternly written letter ) in our current state of affairs , but i can easily see that happening if there was a legitimate threat to the uk . 
  we obviously should not exert the level of influence we did over blair with the iraq war . 
  a lot of things were done wrong . 
  but i think the us and the uk really * do * have a special relationship . 
  at least it 's seen that way on this side of the pond . 
   i dont know what hold the us has on our politicians but they all bend over to preserve that `` special friendship '' and be the usas bff . 
  well , we control the imf , nato and the un . 
  we serve as the de-facto military for nato ( and the un ) , have an extremely large intelligence community ( which our friends get access to ) . 
  we control the replacement parts for most military hardware as well . 
  we 're a massive percentage ( ~ 1/3rd ) of the global consumer market , and serve as a hub for global financial transactions . 
  we get veto power in most institutions we are a part of , and are the primary source of funding for most as well . 
  a lot of people wonder why the us is considered a global super power despite being behind in so many respects ... the answer is : we are * excellent * at exerting soft power to the point that many ( most ? ), 
  global institutions serve almost as extensions of the united states . 
  tldr ; we have many shortcomings on paper , but we have the world by the balls . 
  there are many benefits to being our friend , and few countries are willing to give that up . 
  honestly i think their capabilities would probably have a lot to do with how much american help is out there . 
  the nsa in particular is absolutely stuffed to the brim with encryption and mathematics types . 
  i would be very surprised if american intelligence could n't read ssl encrypted communications without sending a bad cert . 
   staying in the eu is very beneficial to the uk . 
  people just do n't like the eu because they have been brainwashed by the ( conservative ) media . 
  different opinion ? 
  must be brainwashing . 
  no other explanation . 
   google already pinned the public keys for their sites in chrome . 
  only their keys will be considered valid by chrome for gmail . 
  government mitm ones will cause an error . 
  apparently it 's how they found iran doing it . 
  i think it would be a safe assumption to say that britain has access to better technology in this regard than iran . 
   have you been listening to propaganda pushed out by the american gop party ? 
  watching fox news ? 
  neither of these groups propagandize about the french really . 
  the last i heard the gop bring up the french was during the whole embarrassing `` freedom fries '' debacle . 
  not trying to support either of them mind you ... but the french just do n't come up very often . 
  breathalyzers are * horrendously * inaccurate and borderline useless for determining how drunk someone is . 
  not only is bac not actually a measure of `` drunk '' , but breathalyzers do n't even measure bac correctly . 
  [ this article is oriented to the american justice system , but does a good job explaining some of the problems with breathalyzers . 
  ] ( http://www.duicentral.com/dui/the_dui_exception_3.htmll )  the machine is measuring the breath . 
  it is measuring the alcohol in the vapor of the alveolar air in the deep lungs that you expel . 
  but the machine is telling you how much alcohol is in the blood -- not in the breath . 
  so it uses what we call a partition ratio . 
  to put it simplistically , the machine has an old , very primitive computer inside it . 
  there are different machines , but the computers in them will all report , `` well , if you 've got this result from the breath , there must be 2100 times as much in the blood ! ' using a multiplier inside the little computer , that 's what it prints out . 
   but the computer is assuming that your partition ratio is 2100 . 
  problem ? 
  very few people have a partition ratio of 2100-to-1 . 
  it ranges anywhere from about 1100-to-1 up to 3500-to-1 and higher . 
  and there is no way of knowing at the time of testing what your partition ratio was because medical studies have shown that the partition ratio changes within an individual all the time . 
  one person is going to be very different than the person sitting next to him . 
  * your partition ratio tomorrow is going to be different than what it is right now . 
  *  well , what does that mean ? 
  * it means if you blow , let 's say , a .11 and you have a 1300-to-1 partition ratio , that .11 is really 0.07 . 
  * you 're innocent . 
  your crime , unfortunately , was not being average .
