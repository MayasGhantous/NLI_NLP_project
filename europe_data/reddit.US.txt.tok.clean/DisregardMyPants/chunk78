  [ i searched for it on google ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=unliteracy ) and it said * `` did you mean : illiteracy ? * . 
  the only things that would indicate that it exists are [ an urbandictionary post ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=unliterate ) , and a [ single merriam webster ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unliterate ) entry which defines it simply as `` not literate '' . 
  the rest of the results are things like `` the united nations literacy decade '' . 
  if it 's a distinct concept , it 's not very accepted or widespread . 
  illiteracy, 
  / r/iwantout, 
   i 'd rather have a social system that can be abused by a few lazy fucks than none at all like in the us . 
  we have a significantly sized social safety net . 
  it 's not up to swedish standards , but it 's alright . 
  honestly , people here seem to love hyperbole when discussing the us . 
  `` none at all '' ? 
  half the college town i lived in was on food stamps . 
  we have unemployment . 
  we have ebt . 
  we have social security and medicare . 
  we have huge numbers of grants and scholarships . 
  we also have a lot local and state programs that you will never hear of because they 're not federal . 
  really : it 's not great , but it 's not that bad . 
   no , that 's wrong . 
  with that argument , none of the progress we saw in human rights in the last decades would have been made . 
  and what makes you say that ? 
  a society that can gather up the necessary support to pass laws like the ones you describe is a society that would likely be ready improve on those issues * anyways * . 
  it 's an interesting contradiction of sorts : you ca n't pass the laws until you have significant support , but if you have significant support you 're well on your way to not needing the laws . 
   the same can be said of most things . 
  it does n't mean you should n't take a stand against something that is wrong . 
  i 'm not saying it 's the case here ( i 'm not sure how ineffective it will be ) , but if you ca n't properly legislate/enforce a law , that 's a great reason to not pass it . 
  laws are supposed to be passed for their actual real world impacts , not to `` take a stand '' in an ineffective way that may actually cause harm to those you 're trying to protect . 
  proper vigor nullifies condoms . 
  there 's only one solution : sex school . 
  europeans must become better at sex . 
   banks do n't want to loan because the economy is bad . 
  austerity makes the economy worse . 
  how is that going to solve the problem ? 
  depends on the austerity measures . 
  a lot of the problems when it comes to long term solvency are long term entitlements . 
  most of those wo n't have a negative impact on the current economy . 
  but people do n't like to hear they 'll be working more years , getting less in the way of pensions , etc, 
  austerity is not a punishment . 
  austerity is a policy aimed at making banks comfortable loaning to a country that was unable to pay it 's debts back in the past , or that is in danger of not being able to pay them back present day . 
  agree with austerity or disagree , it 's still not a punishment . 
   i do n't want luxembourg ( 0.5 mil ) to have 3 ` senators ' like germany ( 80mil ) . 
  the us senate is also a failure because of these rules . 
  that 's why we have the house of representatives and any bill has to pass both . 
  it means that for any bill to pass it has to be accepted where each state has an equal vote * and * where each person ( proportionally ) has an equal vote . 
  the senate taken alone would be a catastrophe . 
  it makes more sense when you include the house and understand they are part of the same branch . 
  [ it was called the ` great compromise ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_compromise ) and it was created specifically to address the problem you brought up . 
  [ we already have the highest amount of disposable income per capita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_ranking_of_household_income ) and are consistently near the top in terms of [ gdp per capita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) . 
  minimum wage is lower here , but the average wage tends to be quite substantial , especially when you take into account lower prices ( we have a substantial purchasing power per dollar ) the minimum wage is just that - a minimum . 
  most people are n't being paid it . 
  i do n't disagree , it 's just that it 's a very short term solution , and would eliminate any sense of pressure that exists to address the long term problems . 
  even when times were good they needed to borrow a lot . 
  that becomes harder without germany and * much * harder when it looks like they have n't changed any of the problems that got them into this mess . 
   exactly like those but then enough to eliminate a very significant portion of the energy requirement now fulfilled by the combustion of fossil fuels . 
  i 'm sure you understood the gist of my post as not only being about solar arrays but rather about the step to renewable energy . 
  yeah , i understand it . 
  i just chimed in because it 's just a bit more challenging than all of that . 
  we 're a really big country , and one solution wo n't really fit us . 
  the problem being that most of the political will is on the federal level where a uniform solution is the only thing they are really capable of rolling out . 
  i honestly think our only hope is new generation ( low risk , low waste ) nuclear . 
  it 's the only thing that can provide the necessary amount of energy that can be deployed anywhere . 
  this is certainly an interesting perspective , but it 's only solving part of the problem . 
  similar to the problem with eurobonds it only deals with the present debt . 
  germany leaving the euro would leave absolutely no reason for the other countries involved to introduce the needed structural reforms that could keep them afloat . 
  even if they could just inflate their debt away this time , what about next time ? 
  what about the massive deficits still on the books ? 
  the investment market would be petrified of a eurozone without germany , and there would need to be a strong push at reforms to convince people that the problems of today would n't be the problems of tomorrow as well . 
   a revolution would be for usa to install massive fields of solar arrays in the deserts [ you mean like these ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_power_plants_in_the_mojave_desert ), 
  we are in about the same place as other states financially . 
  the supermajority was ill conceived but many of the others pretty much make up for it . 
  it 's a mixed bag and it 's taking a bit to get the hang of it , but the potential is certainly there . 
  i would n't have it any other way . 
   absolutely not . 
  california has a similar system and it is a disaster . 
  i live in california and the ballot initiative system is just fine . 
   this is what it currently is like in the us ( and do n't try to convince me otherwise , i lived in the us for nearly a decade ) . 
  you can walk into any 7-11 , most liquor stores , and any walmart and get a phone with zero contract at all . 
  [ example # 1 : go phone ] ( http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/gophone.html ) [ example # 2 : metropcs ] ( http://www.metropcs.com/metro/ ) - this whole carrier is built around no contracts . 
  [ example # 3 : a grand total of * 66 ** different no contract/prepaid phones from walmart alone ] ( http://www.walmart.com/browse/cell-phones/prepaid-cell-phones/3944_542371_133261/?ref_values=365087 ) [ example # 4 : straighttalk ] ( http://www.straighttalksavings.com/ ) - another no contract phone provider . 
  welcome to the united states : you might have to look around for what you want , but unless it 's reasonable high-speed internet it 's probably here somewhere . 
   my point about it being infallible was more for the public , in that there are a lot of crazy people in america who believe it is the perfect document . 
  perhaps politicians are less rigid on that definition  i do n't think most of us think it 's a perfect document , many just do n't think it being imperfect is an excuse to ignore certain aspects of it without proper procedure . 
  historically we 've preferred using friendly courts to avoid actually changing it properly ( which is slow ) . 
  this has created some pretty steep divisions , effectively `` ending '' political battles before one side was properly defeated . 
   it requires 2/3rds of the house , 2/3rds of the senate and 3/4ths ( ! ), 
  of the states to approve of the ammendment . 
  there are actually [ 4 ways ] ( http://www.usconstitution.net/constam.html ) to amend it . 
   proposal by convention of states , ratification by state conventions ( never used )  proposal by convention of states , ratification by state legislatures ( never used )  proposal by congress , ratification by state conventions ( used once )  proposal by congress , ratification by state legislatures ( used all other times ) it 's also worth noting there 's no timeline for this . 
  once a state approves it , it does n't matter if it takes 50 years for the next one to , then another 50 for the next , etc , etc. 
   are you kidding me ? 
  if california ever wanted to secede from the us , join the commonwealth ( queenie is head of the commonwealth but you do n't have to accept her as a sovereign or monarch ) , i 'd grab a shovel and reopen the welsh coal mines myself and would n't stop until you had your # 50bn . 
  [ you 're too kind ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7fzij.jpg ) . 
  probably they complain because even without being in the ez their economy is heavily tied to the rest of europe , so the decisions made there have a huge impact on their imports/exports . 
   i know we all like to bitch about our governments , but those people are n't stupid . 
  as one of the few readers here from the united states , i resent this generalization . 
  our leaders are stupid . 
   wait - is anybody for austerity ? 
  so why did the markets fear syriza more than the others then ? 
  the other parties ( as i 've understood it ) either do n't like austerity but wo n't do anything about or are willing to try and renegotiate at a somewhat normal pace .
