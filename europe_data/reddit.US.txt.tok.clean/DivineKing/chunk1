that 's racist . 
  reality does n't change with popular opinion you nincompoop . 
  most white people have names that originated in europe , though there are some new-age type names , e.g. 
  falcon , river native american names , e.g. 
  sitting bull , pocahontas african american names , e.g. 
  that 's racist . 
  since when are russia , turkey , georgia , azerbaijan , and armenia part of europe ? 
  and what the hell is an intersex person ? 
  someone who switches from day to day ? 
  cool editorialization bro, 
   monarchy can easily be debunked , but [ watch the faces , mark well the debunkers ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/arnon_grunberg.jpg ) . 
  these are the men whose taproot in eden has been cut : whom no rumour of the polyphony , the dance , can reach -- men to whom pebbles laid in a row are more beautiful than an arch . 
  yet even if they desire mere equality they can not reach it . 
  where men are forbidden to honour a king they honour millionaires , athletes or film stars instead : even famous prostitutes or gangsters . 
  for spiritual nature , like bodily nature , will be served ; deny it food and it will gobble poison . 
  forget the government . 
  how is it undignified to face a painful fate without looking for a way out ? 
  how is it undignified to accept your fate ? 
  i 'm just going to leave this here : top locations united states canada netherlands top demographics male , 45-54 years male , 55-64 years female , 45-54 years, 
  why ? 
   how on earth is sex harmful i never said that . 
  try to work on your reading comprehension . 
   how is teaching about it unnecessary i never said that either . 
  i think it 's unnecessary to teach 5 year olds how to orgasm because , well , it is . 
  it 's just oversexualizing kids for no reason . 
  furthermore , i have no problem with parents teaching their children on their own however much they want to . 
  you do n't think that it 's just a little creepy that home-schooling is illegal in germany and the state-run schools go way beyond what 's necessary to satisfy the typical 5 year old 's curiosity about where babies come from ? 
  see , my statement actually had truth to it . 
  yours does n't . 
  you 're just ** bravely ** america-bashing . 
  inferiority complexes , how do they work ? 
   greater teen pregnancy rates translate into higher abortion in the united states for the industrialized world . 
  the u.s. has twice the teen pregnancy rate as canada both germany and france have a teen pregnancy rate that is four times lower than the u.s. japan 's teen pregnancy rate is eight times lower the united states and your argument is that this is all because 5 year-olds are n't shown how to orgasm in state-run schools ? 
  there are a million factors ( e.g. 
  race , family , regional culture , financial status , etc. ), 
  that come into play there . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  i think it 's completely unnecessary and potentially harmful . 
  i have no problem with teaching history , which germany apparently does . 
  ah , germany , where you can show kids pictures of people having sex but not an odal rune . 
  i do n't have to explain it . 
  i ca n't explain why humans are the only animals to walk upright , but that does n't mean i would think it was normal if people started knuckle walking . 
  you can say that homosexuality is n't a part of human nature .

  there 's plenty of shit that 's pretty common in animals that should n't be applied to humans , e.g. 
  eating the runts of the litter .

  this is the comment i was replying to originally :  south dakota is part of a country . 
  czech republic is a country . 
  [ definition # 4 ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/foreign ), 
  sd maintains relations with 49 other states . 
  they 're both states . 
   they say `` think about the children '' but none of them accepts to ask a child that was raised by homosexuals . 
   all fixed , fast-frozen relations , with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions , are swept away , all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify . 
  all that is solid melts into air , all that is holy is profaned . 
  congratulations france for being on the right side of history . 
  everyone 's probably too busy modifying their bikes . 
  putting playing cards in the spokes and whatnot . 
  where are the neo-nazi banners ? 
  i see greek flags , golden dawn flags , and sun cross flags .

   but nothing indicates gender . 
  yeah , it 's called cultural tradition ... 
  i think you 're confused about natural types of inequality . 
  it is n't just `` individual abilities that differ from person to person , '' it 's also about types of people , e.g. 
  genders and races . 
  basically what this guy and people like him are going to do whenever they encounter poverty is blame it on `` societal structures '' ( sounds marxist to me ) instead of recognizing that most commonly ( especially in western countries , doubly especially in welfare states ) it 's the poor person 's fault . 
  if by `` inequality '' he was only referring to poverty then he would n't have bothered saying both `` poverty and inequality '' . 
  if by `` inequality '' he meant all inequality of income then he 's a marxist . 
   and the `` inequality '' the author was referring to was clearly not meant as inequality in personal abilities . 
  maybe not specifically , i think he was just referring to the overall concept of inequality . 
  which , since he wants to `` change '' it , means he is anti-nature . 
   but inequal distribution of wealth is unquestioningly a result of social action and historically contingent he said `` poverty * and * inequality '' . 
  he was n't referring to unequal distribution of wealth . 
   however , it is vital to recognise that poverty and inequality also have ~ ~ structural ~ ~ * natural * causes ... inequality is a fact of nature . 
   ... and start a real debate on how to change those things . 
  concession/apology accepted . 
  yes , yes , it 's so clear now !, 
  if you outlaw gay propaganda , it 's only a matter of time before [ putin 's out scourging the wilderness for the last buttpirate in all the motherland ] ( http://media.salon.com/2012/09/russia-putins-cranes.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg ) !,

  racism is a marxist construct . 
  animals function on instinct . 
  i do n't see a group of wolves debating the morality of going after fawns . 
  humans either believe in transcendence and have morals based on that , or they do n't . 
  there 's nothing absolutely inherently morally `` right '' about working together in society to an atheist . 
  essentially everything . 
  any `` morals '' a modern atheist has are pure sentimentality , based on the morals of their historical religious tradition . 
  i do n't believe that people approach the world without the belief in god . 
  i do n't believe in as much circumstance as you 're suggesting .
