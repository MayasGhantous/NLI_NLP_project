  i also do n't believe that punishing an ungodly person is injustice ; `` all pain is a punishment , and every punishment is inflicted for love as much as for justice '' - joseph de maistre, 
  by traditional god i mean a god in line with [ tradition ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/traditional_school ) . 
  the concept of `` god '' is just a way of expressing transcendence . 
  yes , atheism and humanism are both excluded because they deny transcendence . 
  a traditional god . 
  yes , you 're wrong . 
  yes , no . 
  any and all corruption , decadence , or injustice is born of ungodliness . 
   you 're claiming that no great knowledge was reach during the enlightenment ? 
  i said there it was n't a great level of knowledge . 
  in other words , it was all worldly , unessential knowledge . 
  that being said , i 'm not against worldly knowledge , i 'm just not in favor of its supposed supremacy . 
   that leonardo 's great contraptions were irrelevant ? 
  nitpicking : da vinci was n't part of the enlightenment , he was part of the renaissance . 
  i think the first part of this comment addresses his relevance . 
   how can you separate in favour of some thing ? 
  by the way you wording that sentence it sounds like you meant replacement rather than separation . 
  i should have said `` it was a moment of separation ** from ** the higher dimension of knowledge in favor of worldly knowledge . 
  hopefully that clears things up . 
  at the cost of spiritual and moral decadence . 
  the enlightenment was n't a moment of reaching a great level of knowledge , it was a moment of separation of the higher dimension of knowledge in favor of worldly knowledge . 
  so you went from worshiping the transcendent reality to worshiping yourselves , and you expect me to view that as a good thing ? 
  ah , i see you are from france . 
  therefore , it 's reasonable for me to assume that you agree with everything the government of france has ever done and the principles that it has based itself on . 
  it was awesome in the way that you might describe watching someone being beheaded as awesome .

   viii . 
  conclusion  right-to-carry laws reduce the number of people killed or wounded from multiple victim public shootings as many attackers are either deterred from attacking or when attacks do occur they are stopped before the police can arrive . 
  we are able to provide evidence for the first time that the harm from crimes that still occur can be mitigated . 
  given that half the attackers in these multiple victim public shootings have had formal diagnoses of mental illness , the fact that some results indicate concealed handgun laws reduce these attacks by almost 70 percent is remarkable . 
   differences in state right-to-carry laws are also important : restricting the places where permits are prohibited increases murders , injuries and shootings ; more training requirements reduce injuries ; and higher fees increase injuries and the number of attacks . 
  the much greater deterrence that right-to-carry laws have for multiple victim public shootings than for other crimes like murder is consistent with the notion that a higher probability of citizens being able to defend themselves should produce a greater level of deterrence . 
  the results are robust with respect to different specifications of the dependent variable , different specifications of the handgun law variable , and different control variables . 
  not only does the passage of a right-to-carry law have a significant impact on multiple shootings but it is the only gun law that appears to have a significant impact . 
  while other law enforcement efforts -- from the arrest rate for murder and the death penalty -- reduce the number of people harmed from multiple shootings , the effect is not as consistently significant as for right-to-carry laws . 
  finally , the data provides no evidence of substitution from shootings to bombings and little consistent evidence of `` copycat '' effects . 
  why not ? 
  because you are n't willing to ? 
  seems like you should have just said right off the bat that you were an anti-cannibalism bigot and saved us both the trouble . 
  i do n't see how that makes what i said unintelligent . 
  how is what i said unintelligent ? 
  why should cognitive ability factor into it ? 
  pigs are significantly smarter than turkeys , but i have n't felt any worse while eating them . 
  i say we start eating people . 
   the priest said that it 's mainly the victims of domnestic violence against females that are to blame no he did n't . 
  he said :  `` let 's ask ourselves . 
  is it possible that men have all gone mad at one stroke ? 
  we do n't think so ... '' in other words , he does n't think that 100 % of the blame for domestic violence should go towards men . 
  if you disagree with him , then you are of the mindset that i put forth in my previous comment . 
  nope , everyone knows that 100 % of domestic violence is committed by men and all of it is completely and utterly unprovoked . 
  no woman in the history of the world has done anything to exacerbate a problem or contributed to any negative condition whatsoever . 
  so you refute it with anecdotal evidence . 
  but anyway , for people who claim to love diversity , cultural marxists seem hell-bent on turning everyone into a tan-skinned , brown-eyed mass . 
  we got the next freud right here , ladies and gentlemen . 
  so brave, 
  yes , why should n't they ?

  just going to leave this here , a comment focusing on the perpetrators of homicide in the u.s. : http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/14vnt1/why_does_usas_lack_of_functioning_mental_health/c7gx3rf, 
  the full study is linked to in my comment . 
   believe it or not many people feel this will make the country safer . 
  believe it or not , the facts back up this belief : http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/files/41.lott_.final_.pdf  allowing citizens without criminal records or histories of significant mental illness to carry concealed handguns deters violent crimes and appears to produce an extremely small and statistically insignificant change in accidental deaths . 
  if the rest country had adopted right-to-carry concealed handgun provisions in 1992 , at least 1,570 murders and over 4,177 rapes would have been avoided . 
  edit : uh-oh , the facts do n't mesh with my worldview , better downvote them . 
  ** trigger warning ** how dare you say that !? 
  do n't you know that the phrase `` stand up for '' is an ableist chauvinistic anti-egalitarian phrase !? 
  just because you are cis-bodied does n't mean that you can look down upon us trans-gender-queer otherkin !, 
  incredibly high . 
  the highest rate in the u.s. is 35 % , and that 's for people making over $ 388,000 . 
  surely they would be banned and imprisoned if they were actually neo-nazi ? 
  is everything not left of center just automatically considered `` neo-nazi '' ? 
  you need to work on your politically incorrect opinions .

  when did i say that my country had real values ? 
  you guys get defensive about the whole us vs. europe thing too easily . 
  i was n't using `` european '' as an insult . 
  social democracy is an insult to anyone with real values . 
  shocking , you 're a european . 
  i bet you 're a social democrat , too . 
  and for the record , i 'm not a republican , in either sense of the word . 
  alternatively , is n't it a shame how some people have been brainwashed into thinking that favoring one 's race over others is something to be ashamed of .

  oh god , policemen have political opinions that do n't side with the people who throw molotovs at them , sound the alarm !, 
  sorry for believing in indigenous rights ... 
  one time 8 days ago ... totally regularly ... do you not think that white people should have rights ? 
  i never defended golden dawn , i pointed out the double standard of who draws the ire of most people . 
  sorry , but how is any of what i said stupid ? 
  you may not want to accept it , but that does n't make it wrong . 
  it 's not the same shit . 
  look at how much muslims have freaked out over cartoons and shitty mini-movies about muhammad . 
  if you put on a full production play about him being a faggot , they would undoubtedly go a lot farther than allegedly beating some people up and calling them gay . 
  the point is that people are going after the system-determined `` fair game '' of christians and nationalists , while ignoring an obviously much bigger problem . 
   the blog keeptalkinggreece ( via evan fleischer ) reports that the golden dawn ( along with some conservative religious leaders ) were protesting a showing of the play corpus christi , which depicts jesus and the apostles as gay . 
  so golden dawn allegedly beat up and called a couple people faggots for blaspheming their savior . 
  imagine what would have happened if that play was about muhammad ...
