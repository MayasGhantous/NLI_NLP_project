  who cares ?

  does n't it just mean `` hail victory '' ? 
  says the nihilist . 
  not sure if trolling or just indoctrinated by atheists ... 
  a value is something regarded as `` good '' . 
  `` secular '' describes something worldly and temporal . 
  `` value '' and the concept of `` good '' are inherently universal and timeless . 
  something that is conceived of as `` good '' in a secular way would be better described as `` temporarily useful '' or `` subjectively preferable '' . 
   secular values oxymoron .

  there 's a difference between indication and absolute proof . 
  there 's definitely indication that he 's muslim - he 's obviously of middle eastern descent , he 's in a crowd of people protesting because the muslim faith was insulted , and he 's holding a sign declaring that islam is coming . 
  that was only `` awesome '' according to awesome 's neutral meaning ( i.e. 
  causing awe ) as the most decadent , degenerate commercial in existence . 
  why is the sky blue ? 
  why is water wet ? 
  why did judas rat to romans while jesus slept ? 
   a shocking 41,4 % of rapes were commited by immigrants you think that 's shocking ? 
  after skimming over this thread , allow me to quote ted kaczynski :  leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong , good and successful . 
  they hate america , they hate western civilization , they hate white males , they hate rationality . 
  the reasons that leftists give for hating the west , etc. 
  clearly do not correspond with their real motives . 
  they say they hate the west because it is warlike , imperialistic , sexist , ethnocentric and so forth , but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures , the leftist finds excuses for them , or at best he grudgingly admits that they exist ; whereas he enthusiastically points out ( and often greatly exaggerates ) these faults where they appear in western civilization . 
  thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist 's real motive for hating america and the west . 
  he hates america and the west because they are strong and successful . 
  disclaimer : i am not at all a fan of america . 
  the us is most definitely not moving to the right . 
  a person considered `` liberal '' 50 years ago would undoubtedly be considered `` conservative '' by today 's standards . 
   european moral superiority is often asserted , despite the fact that the greatest atrocities in human history -- colonialism , two catastrophic wars , nazism , the holocaust -- were all committed by europeans . 
  was mao a european ? 
  was pol pot ? 
  fuck this white guilt-pushing ethno-masochist . 
  i refuse to continue this discussion . 
  get back to me when you 've managed to pull your head out of your ass . 
   you silly cunt http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/graham%27s_hierarchy_of_disagreement.jpg  just because you 're a racist does n't mean everyone else is . 
  that 's not a political stance , it 's basic logic . 
  i do n't at all agree with their politics . 
   that the color scheme happens to correspond * exactly * to the flag of the nazi party is just incidental this just in !,

  ... yeah , that 's golden dawn 's flag ... 
  i 've already acknowledged the fact that it has a traditional hellenic meander symbol on it . 
  how does restating what we 're arguing about make your argument right ? 
  maybe you 're cross-eyed and when you look at it , somehow you see a swastika ?

  have n't there been anarchists rioting , firebombing , and attacking police in greece for a while now ? 
  but if the police round up and deport * illegal * immigrants , that 's a bigger problem ? 
  are n't there more communists in the greek parliament than there are golden dawn mps ? 
  but since golden dawn 's [ meander ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meander_%28art%29 ) insignia looks kinda-sorta like a swastika to these paranoid leftists , suddenly the ghost of hitler is coming to kill everyone ? 
  give me a break . 
  good . 
  protip : every single race/ethnic group feels natural `` racism '' and xenophobia , and each person naturally favors their own race over others . 
  if a certain race/ethnic group loses their sense of pride in their group ( through years of propaganda beginning in childhood , for example ) , that group will die out and be replaced with a group that is n't ashamed of their heritage . 
  sad . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_brown_%28abolitionist%29 an ideology can no longer be ignored and dismissed once it has driven at least one man to commit an act such as what brown did . 
  in a way he was the canary that shows us the danger posed by the anti-slavery activists in america . 
  he refused to legitimize the court and apologized for not killing more people : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkumb70aat0 butthurt judge . 
  well obviously - he would be 115 if he was still alive .

  a left-wing group famous for using deadly violence to try to achieve their goals , and much more so than any current right-wing group in europe and possibly the world . 
  of course if you took mustquitreddit 's comment as referring to genocide , there are plenty of examples of left-wing genocide as well - from the soviet 's holodomor to the khmer rouge 's genocide of cambodians . 
  like what ? 
  til that expressing some concern about the state of the olympics ( before it was finished ) is making an absolute fool of yourself . 
   would he have done that for the 14 year old child of a person he does n't know and has nothing to give to him ? 
  so for someone to be a decent guy in your book , they have to shut down their company and fly their workers around the country to try to find all the missing people that they can ?

  lewis also , if democracy is the best form of government , what happens when so-called fascists like golden dawn are democratically elected ? 
  fascism is better than liberal democracy . 
  it 's nowhere near as good as monarchy , but it could be a step in the right direction . 
   it would just be better to admit the truth that most of these people have no clue about what is going on around them or in their own country you do n't think this could be said about the average voter ? 
  democracy is a shitty form of governance regardless of whether it 's representative or direct . 
  you need a king .

  `` the monarchical principle is laughed at by vulgar and foolish people in all the suburbs of europe . 
  it is hated in all the gutters of the world . 
  the reason is simple . 
  it enshrines with a fitting dignity and elaboration the principle of authority as something independent of this or that politician . 
  it places it above attack . 
  it symbolises and consecrates an attitude of mind essential to the happiness of peoples . '',
