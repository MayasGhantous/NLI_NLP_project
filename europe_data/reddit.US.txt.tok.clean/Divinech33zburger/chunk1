alright alright fair enough you could have said so at the beggining . 
  it 's just a unique position that i havent really heard of before, 
  sorry , but your opinion is not obvious to me . 
  you said that `` if you are the same skin colour as other people who are generally considered to be white but you do n't consider yourself to be white for whatever reason you are not coming from a reasonable place of thought '' . 
  afghans are the same skin color as people who are ` generally considered to be white ' but i do n't really know anyone who considers them to be white . 
  if you consider afghans white , then that makes sense , but otherwise you are creating a double standard . 
  look mate i do n't see why you feel compelled to look through my comment history ? 
  i could be a conspiracy theorist who believes the nazi 's did 9/11 for all it matters i just want to see know if you consider afghans white, 
  [ most afghans look really white ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/afghan_girls_in_september_2012.jpg ) . 
  i 'm just wondering what your opinion on their whiteness is . 
  are afghans white ? 
  i 'll try to address each of your points individually :  i know exactly what it means . 
  i word my message fitting the manner i want my meaning to appear . 
  there is no doubt in my mind that you believe what you type . 
  but what you type is not at all backed up by either of the sources you provide . 
  you claim that [ 80 + % of european jewish dna ... comes from pre-historical european dna and ... not from the levant . ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y0tbb/headsup_popular_neonazi_site_daily_stormer_is/cp63zv6 ) . 
  had you been claiming that ashkenazi maternal dna is mostly european , then you would [ have provided a very excellent source ] ( http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/131008/ncomms3543/full/ncomms3543.html#ref9 ) . 
   the way my meaning appears in the message is absolutely correct . 
  if your message is that at least 80 % of ashkenazi dna is european , then you are absolutely not correct . 
  there is no where near that much genetic variation in humans , on average , [ humans are 99.5 % biochemically similar . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/04/science/04vent.html?pagewanted=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1428361406-cs4tpskdh9ye4iezyurciw ) but i 'm going to assume you were talking only about the sections of dna which can be used to determine ancestry , namely , ydna , mtdna , and x-chromosomal dna . 
  [ as you can see , even if 100 % of mtdna was of european origin , it would still not make up 80 % of all the ydna , mtdna , and x-chromosomal dna . 
  ] ( http://phillipsdnaproject.com/images/stories/general/faqs/dna_makeup_final.png )  roman is n't known . 
  this was my bad , i should have put a source for that . 
  [ here 's one just if you want to look into it ] ( http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2013/10/did-modern-jews-originate-italy ) . 
  it 's probably not an issue worth looking into too much , as i 'm sure we can both agree that roman-italians would count as european . 
   80 % of all jewish europeans are descended from 4 women who descended solely from prehistoric europe . 
  first off , do n't mistake all jewish europeans for ashkenazi . 
  there are also the iberian [ sephardic jews ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sephardi_jews ) who would not have descended from these 4 women . 
  yet the now modified statement , ` 80 % of all * ashkenazi * are descended from 4 women who descended solely from prehistoric europe ' is still , sadly , incorrect . 
  rather , using the very sources you provided , [ we find that 40 % of ashkenazi mtdna comes from four european women , and at least 40 % more come from later female conversions ] ( http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/131008/ncomms3543/full/ncomms3543.html ) . 
  do keep in mind , the ashkenazi are an ethnicity on their own . 
  the mtdna of one pure ashkenazi jew is going to be extremely similar to the mtdna of another pure ashkenazi jew . 
  and a founder of the ashkenazi ethnic group , such as these four women , are going to be present in the ancestry of anyone with any type of ashkenazi ancestry . 
  in fact , the most accurate way to phrase your statement would be to say that ` * 100 % * of all * ashkenazi * are descended from 4 women who descended solely from prehistoric europe . '  as an atheist i do n't often reference the bible . 
  as a practicing jew , i do n't reference the bible outside of a religious context . 
  in an argument so closely related to science , i do not see such an unscientific source could at all be considered relevant . 
   the bible is clear is its genealogy : those who are to posses israel must be descended from the lineage of abraham who descended from the lineage of shem . 
  europeans , according to the bible , are not descended from the line which carries abraham but are instead descended from japeth . 
  you said you are an atheist , so i 'm pretty surprised you do n't know that avraham , yefet ( or as you know them , ` abraham ' and ` japeth '' ) , and shem have no basis in fact and are almost certainly fictional . 
  and do you really want to argue that europeans are descended from shem , who would have been born only ~ 4,000 years ago ? 
  earlier you stated that jews have ancestry in europe dating back 12,000 years , 3 times longer than ( what you seem to claim is ) the existence of europeans . 
   if you are n't from the line of shem and descended from abraham , no israel for you . 
  are you talking about the modern state of israel ? 
  because that is a ) extremely off topic , b ) disregarding the entire fact that modern state of israel was founded by atheists who would have found what the religious argument you posed as ridiculous , and c ) extremely offensive to the [ 2.3 million non jewish population of israel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_israel ) . 
   also , there is a part in the ot about the fake jews coming to claim israel . 
  do you mean revelation 3:9 ? 
  that is new testament , nothing to do with judaism . 
   to your last sentence - actually the paternal line is far more mixed/diluted than the maternal . 
  it is n't dominated by near east ( ne ) dna as mtdna is dominated by european dna . 
  a reason for this is mtdna ( from mom ) mixes with both children . 
  y chromosomes ( from dad ) only mixes with male children . 
  so you have a dominant mtdna european being delivered constantly into the male line and in case of every girl born she is receiving only european ( e ) mtdna . 
  let us imagine these 4 european ( e ) women ( from the dna study ) married 3 near east ( ne ) jewish men and 1 european ( emc ) male who converted to judaism . 
  each couple has 2 children . 
  1 couple has 2 boys ( b ) , 1 couple has 2 girls ( g ) ( in this case the father 's ne dna completely ends as he had no son to pass his y to ) , 2 couples have 1 boy ( b ) and 1 girl ( g ) each . 
  we 'd have a total of 4 boys and 4 girls . 
  all 4 girls , zero ne dna . 
  3 boys born from a ne jewish father and from a pure european mother , are now half european . 
  the boy and girl from the european convert couple , still pure european . 
  now , each boy marries a girl . 
  the one pure european boy , any girl he marries is going to be 100 % european . 
  their children , 100 % european . 
  until this line was introduced to mtdna from the near east it would only produce european children . 
  the 3 remaining girls , still 100 % european . 
  one of the 3 marries a boy , he is 50m . 
  they have a child , it is a girl - that girl , 100 % european . 
  as long as this family line continues , every girl born from this line will be purely european . 
  in reality , every jewish woman in europe ( or israel ) today with that dna is 100 % european . 
  she has never carried , she can never carry , near east dna . 
  this weakening of the male historical dna through this addition of mtdna ( as well as other biological changes occurring during passing of y chromosome from father to son ) is , from what i understand , a prime reason mtdna is the focus of those doing research in genetics . 
  to end - we should be clear . 
  while up to 20 % of jewish european mtdna is not actually european , the 20 % is n't wholly near east mtdna either . 
  there is asian , there is african . 
  only a small fraction , less than 1/10th , of european mtdna traces to the near east/levant/israel . 
  for the y lineage - it 's a bit stronger than 1/10th but is still incredibly mixed and ( again ) not dominated by one large sub-group as mtdna is . 
  i will aplaud you here for obviously a very good amount of research and math , and i am not going to ignore it , but the fact is that there is very little , in fact , less than 0.5 % genetic admixture in the y-chromosome . 
  again , i invite you to look on the very good article on wikipedia , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_studies_of_jewish_origins#y-dna_of_ashkenazi_jews . 
  the think you are making a mistake about is that you think that 80 % european orgins means that 80 % of ashkenazi jews are completely european . 
  what it really means is that a small group of jews married a small group of roman woman . 
  because of the seculusion jews place themselves in , there was extreme inbreeding , and a very small amoutn of conversion , so every ashkenazi jew today has each of those four women in their ancestry . 
  mix that in with a small amount of converts and all the inbreeding , it is easy to show how the maternal line can get very european while the paternal line does not . 
  in fact , there is very clear consensus that the paternal line is very middle eastern . 
  wikipedia has a good article with a lot of sources on it here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_studies_of_jewish_origins#y-dna_of_ashkenazi_jews there are really only two scientific theories on the orgin of ashkenazi jews today . 
  the first is the levant/ancient israelite theory which is supported by some roman records as well as genetic tests which show genetic similarty most closest to sephrardic jews and then second closest to modern day palestians . 
  the other theory is khazar orgin , which is supported by the fact that there was a large jewish kindgom in central asia . 
  however it mainly only exists as a theory today because no one knows what really happened to them and there any really good sample populations to test on . 
  if the khazar theory is correct , then the khazars would have had a very middle eastern dna for the region of the world they were in . 
  80 percent ? 
  do you have a source on that ? 
  there is no doubt that jews have european dna , genetic tests show that . 
  however , if you look only at the maternal line , you are only getting half the story . 
  the paternal line has consitantly shown a middle eastern origin . 
  this does not at all contradict the article you posted for the record - the article is simply saying that jews have some european dna . 
  there was a lot of genetic testing which seems to show that ashkenazi jews are italian on the matrilineal line and israelite on the patrilineal line . 
  obviously ashkenazi jews look different than modern day palestinians because of severe bottlenecking ( at one point the ashkenazi population was at only around 340 people ) . 
  i appreicate the comment  politics wise , it 's kind of interesting , because right after trump won a lot of the news was saying that the us is similar to italy politically , and that trump is like an american berlusconi . 
  i do n't know enough about italian politics to know how accurate that is , but that 's what the news said anyways, 
  haha , sounds like you 're from glorious bern . 
  visiting switzerland is definately on my bucket list , i 'll just need to remember to bring my own mustard to st. gallen,
