  are you serious lol ... isis have different opinion too , hitler had different opinion too . 
  what 's your point ? 
  * twats, 
  yeah because the western politicians are clean af, 
  but bbbut the domino effect !!!, 
  alt-right and shit ... 
  he played all the battlefields . 
  tell me more . 
  i love how much it bothers you, 
  do n't get upset over what redditors want to post . 
  go destroy some ships . 
  it 's school day tomorrow . 
  all of these flavors and you choose to be salty, 
  and you dedicate a % of your life posting about world of warships . 
  what 's your point ? 
  you must be a fun dude to hang out with on a saturday night . 
  some say he 's still crying to this day . 
  two brits attacked me personally for posting about uk and brexit often and the mods deleted their comments . 
  that 's all . 
  who said it 's about brexit . 
  you having flashbacks ? 
  i 'm not sure . 
  i remember farage used it in his campaign . 
  so basically you are saying `` you are responsible for us hating on immigrants and supporting white supremacists '' lol sure, 
  europe 's rejects . 
  looks like the xenophobia in both countries getting similar too . 
  you will never repair relationship with countries that annex neighbors yet you gon na try to scare ee with supporting annexation . 
  still wo n't get good deal from eu, 
  just brits and people outside eu ( mostly norway and switzerland ) posting how eu is dying . 
  would n't pay much attention . 
  mostly true . 
  woke up to a thread of poles and brits arguing who 's more xenophobic . 
  good times , europe . 
  but but the anglosphere the british redditors told me about ... 
  it must be wrong . 
  brits on reddit told me everything is okay ... 
  well that 's what the xenophobic brexiters do lol, 
  sure sure ... 
  i honestly do n't want bigots and racists to like me . 
  i think you do n't know what these words mean .

  i bet brexiters are street smart though lol, 
  `` 66 % people who left school at 16 voted for leave . 
  71 % of those with university degrees voted to remain . '',

  i agree . 
  a lot of people voted leave because of their hate towards immigrants . 
  this is something i ca n't accept . 
  there are plenty of smart people who voted leave but they should have been more vocal so we can hear some serious arguments . 
  right now the majority thinks bigots and racists voted leave . 
  well , the stats show mostly uneducated idiots and old fart voted leave . 
  like the average brexiter . 
  i just said maybe these protests target these 17 million lol chill . 
  if you think that 48 % of the population will just be silent and wont try to change things you will be surprised . 
  this is not a game that you win or lose . 
  society does n't work like this . 
  also the politicians did n't trigger article 50 yet and this also may be a to put pressure on them . 
  if you do n't see a the point of it maybe you should look closer . 
  brexiters are n't good at math . 
  you are speaking to people that thought 30 million bulgarians and romanians will flood their country ... 
  27.8 % did n't vote . 
  yes , man ... it 's a huge percent . 
  brexit vote won by like 1-2 million people . 
  17 million did n't vote . 
  billions !, 
  maybe to make a huge percent of the uk population that did n't vote take a side ? 
  a russian would know to not protest vote . 
  i doubt it . 
  just like the terrorist attacks in usa did n't increase trump 's support . 
  another economic expert ... no one knows what kind of laws uk will have after actually leaving eu so idk where did you get the idea that businesses can begin shifting ... 
  the thing that 's happening is that the market does n't believe uk will leave in near future and some say they may not even leave after all . 
  fear mongering ? 
  lol, 
  they also operate in north america ... 
  i seriously thought uk 's welfare is okay . 
  seems like they have a lot of problems to resolve there . 
  do n't worry . 
  she still gon na win the elections . 
  no one believes they actually gon na leave anymore . 
  the same yougov that gave win for the remain campaign ... 
  that will change when uk leave . 
  stay tuned for independence day ... soon ... eventually, 
  but ... the domino effect :(, 
  unlike redditors . 
  am i right ? 
  next you will be telling me turkey wo n't join eu this year . 
  uk media lied to me . 
  he speaks what he thinks lol, 
  lol, 
  you mean the 4 countries in uk ? 
  will be hilarious if after all the `` independence day '' shouting they do n't even leave lol, 
  and who had half of their athletes suspended even if they never gave positive probe . 
  wtf, 
  http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/brexit-who-voted-leave-the-old-less-educated-and-christians/news-story/55d06ce2bf15e99fe577d0f2fefa25ef there 's no need to paint them . 
  the stats show it . 
  `` we are fed up with facts and experts '' - brexiters . 
  uk is 4 countries though, 
  brexiters do n't like math . 
  they are fed up with experts and logic . 
  we love it actually .
