  wont feel 100 % like the real thing , but it 's way closer than what you have now . 
  that relationship would make sense , but research has actually shown that circumcision does n't make you last longer and can in fact cause premature ejaculation . 
  some of the nerve endings in the foreskin supposedly allow for better anticipation and control of orgasm . 
  it is . 
  the overwhelming majority of phimosis cases can be cured with stretching . 
  many doctors in the us are astoundingly ignorant of foreskins though and will jump straight to cutting it off , even for minor cases . 
  the bit between the scar and the head is inner foreskin remnant .

  there are forms of fgm that are far less damaging than male circumcision , but they 're still illegal in the west .

  there are different kinds of fgm . 
  not all kinds are worse than mgm , but all kinds are banned in the civilized world . 
  some do n't need lube , some do . 
  it depends how tightly you 're cut . 
  cutting overly tightly is common , as the procedure is done on tiny infants . 
  some guys have it so bad that erections are painful . 
  i 've even heard of bleeding from overly tight cuts . 
  thanks , i 'm already doing it . 
  seems to work pretty well thus far . 
  does n't get everything back , but it 's way better than doing nothing . 
  hopefully foregen is successful and circumcision can truly be undone , although that 's likely to be very expensive . 
  some fgm is more damaging , some is actually less damaging . 
  they 're all banned in the west regardless . 
  circumcision does n't really make sense from the point of view of either side of the abortion debate . 
  for the pro-life side , if fetuses have a right to life and they feel pain during abortions , do n't infants have a right their entire bodies and to not be subjected to excruciating , totally unnecessary pain ? 
  on the pro-choice side , the prime argument is `` her body , her choice '' . 
  well what about `` his body , his choice '' ? 
  the baby is out at that point . 
  the mother does n't gain anything by slicing off the most sensitive parts of his penis . 
  seems more like that 's something circumcised guys in denial tell themselves to feel better about it .
