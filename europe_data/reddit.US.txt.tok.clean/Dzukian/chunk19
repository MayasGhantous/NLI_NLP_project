  they 're not with france and germany on this , they 're with the united states . 
  rumsfeld was merely saying that europe is something more than france and germany . 
  thinking `` france and germany '' as a synonym for `` europe '' is the old way of thinking about europe . 
  the `` new europe '' is one that has many different actors and the power of germany and france has been diluted . 
  his point was that you could n't paint the diplomatic conflict as `` us against europe '' because most of the countries in europe were on board with the us : it was the big countries like france and germany that were not . 
  or at least , that 's what he 's claiming , which is what is important in the context of his quote . 
  now , i do n't really agree because france and germany still hold a controlling share of the influence , but it 's certainly much less franco-german-centric than it was in the ecsc . 
   nations/people do n't like to to used and that is what the us does on a daily bases now . 
  states do n't have friends , they have interests . 
  time to bring back bismarck , because pretending like anyone gives a shit about your `` moral high ground '' does n't do you or your interests any favors . 
   also , no offence and do n't take this as an attack , but this is what you usualy get when you annex another country 's territory , and wo n't do much ethnic cleansing there . 
  so i guess the moral of the story is `` always ethnically cleanse minorities before you can get any negative publicity from your treatment of them ? '', 
  i do n't want the germans ' intelligence efforts exposed , because i have priorities . 
  the german and the american and the british intelligence services have oversight by democratically elected leaders . 
  let 's expose the russians , the chinese , and the iranians . 
  i do n't know why you 're all offended by the phrase `` old europe . '', 
  post-soviet europe , after being liberated by the collapse of the ussr , was free to be `` european '' and not merely satellite of the soviets . 
  they were `` new europe '' because they were new to being `` europe , '' `` europe '' being the free countries of that continent . 
  well , yeah . 
  i 'm just saying , every grocery store i 've ever been to -- including in israel , which despite impressive growth is still not really `` western '' rich -- looks more like [ this ] ( http://kansasgrains.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/aisle.jpg ) than op 's picture . 
  a five-foot-wide stretch might be completely filled with peanut butter , but every shelf has at least two brands of peanut butter , and sometimes more variation of flavor/type within brands too . 
  a variety of options is the hallmark of a wealthy country . 
  that 's why the arrows are pointing out the lack of options . 
  probably the fact that the shelves are filled with the exact same single product , and the huge tray in the middle is filled with one type of bottle ( presumably milk ) . 
  think about the grocery stores you go to : there probably is n't a single shelf in there that has the exact same item on the top and bottom shelves for ( at least ) five feet or so , and no large tray would have only one type of food in it . 
   as you see , nationality , cultural identity , heritage and social class are a complicated subject in europe , at least in germany . 
  many people take deep pride in those things and more so than some time ago , i think . 
  it is then with this background that people are offended by american-italians calling themselves italians , as they clearly do not fit in the framework that is used so much in europe . 
  nationality , cultural identity , heritage and social class are complicated subjects * everywhere * . 
  you 're not some unique special european snowflakes with unique european problems like `` nationality . '', 
  and if you do n't want to have your delicate sensibilities offended by an american daring to identify with a european ethnicity ( the horror !, 
  ) , then maybe you should explain to us exactly what `` the framework that is used so much in europe '' * is * before getting your panties in a twist . 
  we 're 2000 miles away , how do you expect us to understand without putting in ten seconds of effort to explain why you 're irritated ? 
   i go in the realm of speculation now , but imagine someone from the so-called south in the usa emigrating to , say , the new england states . 
  they marry there , have children , those grow up there and in a few generations a member of that family moves to the south . 
  are they southern now or new england people ? 
  in europe they 'd be seen as southern with new england influence . 
  firstly , i do n't know why you said `` so-called south , '' because `` the south '' is perfectly understandable . 
  anyway , a southerner moves to new england . 
  he is still a southerner . 
  his kids , assuming they adopt civilized ( i.e. 
  new england ) ways , will be half-southern , or will at least be `` new englanders with a southern dad . '', 
  their kids will be fully-recognized new englanders . 
  now , if one of those new englanders moves to the south , he 'll still be a new englander in the south ( or , more accurately , a `` yankee '' ) . 
  but his kids will be half-new englanders , or `` southern with a yankee dad , '' and those kids ' kids will be universally acknowledged as southern . 
  you 're the best and everyone else is just jealous of your rad military and your royal head of state . 
   we see them as germans with specific cultural roots , like turkish or korean . 
  really ? 
  because the handful of germans i know refer to the turks in german as `` turks '' and not as `` turko-germans '' or `` germans of turkish heritage . '', 
  they 're `` turks , '' full stop . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but my understanding is that when the personal union between poland and lithuania happened , the grand duchy was larger than the korona : it was only with the union of lublin that the ukrainian lands were transferred from the grand duchy to the crown . 
  this trait is not exclusive to males of the lithuanian persuasion , though ... 
   [ ] ( / abmeh ) watch [ pmqs ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fryxlzetwd8 ) , i heard that some americans do it for entertaiment . 
  wow , pmqs is nuts . 
  it 's like a fucking football game with that much booing . 
  also , disregarding what he actually says , ed miliband sounds exactly what i think a `` snooty british twat '' should sound like . 
   i have crazy idea that tony blair invaded iraq only to appease americans . 
  they give him standing ovation in their parliament , without any reason whatsoever , while in own parliament he was booed . 
  our politicians give standing ovations to pretty much every visiting pm , because the only pms to ever address congress are from really close allies like britain or israel . 
  we would never let khamenei or putin or castro address the congress . 
  russia might not be able to win , but it could make the cost of fighting the war to a finish for the europeans very high . 
  if the europeans think that a war will cost them dearly , then merely the threat of military conflict will be able to coerce the europeans into doing what the russians want . 
  in israel , too , some of the walls of the old city of jerusalem still have the bullet holes from the war of independence . 
  as an american with lithuanian heritage , i 'd love to visit . 
  it looks absolutely beautiful . 
  to be totally shallow , though , i am somewhat put-off by the fact that i hear about how beautiful lithuanian women are constantly but have never once heard such praise levied on lithuanian men . 
  not exactly the most encouraging news ... 
  you might be correct , but it 's still a funny observation about the irish political/press relationship that they can print that . 
  even heavily partisan papers in the us would never do this . 
  the boston globe would never run a picture of republican congressmen with the label `` a fistful of assholes '' underneath . 
  / r/historicalwhatif would have a field day with this , but my amateur guess is that , if poland and the rest of east-central europe had a defensive alliance , then that alliance would have been triggered by the german invasion of czechoslovakia . 
  the czechs/slovaks , backed by the poles , romanians , etc. , would have put up a serious fight , and if the germans were seen to be taking a beating ( even if still winning ) , the french might have gotten involved instead of doing nothing and ignoring their defensive alliance with the czechs/slovaks . 
  the germans , in a weakened position and facing stiffer opposition on all sides , would probably have folded , though the nazis probably would have continued to stay in power . 
  base tax is too high for diplo-vassalizing ... :(, 
  patrilineally , i am lithuanian , and dzukian refers to [ dz\u016bkija ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dz%c5%abkija ) in lithuania . 
   is it really a common sterotype that people from new jersey are douchey/proles ? 
  yes . 
  i am from the new england and new jersayans are definitely seen as trashier new yorkers : loud , obnoxious , provincial , and tacky ( if italian ) or cheap ( if jewish ) . 
  there are only italians and jews in new jersey . 
  basically , every stereotype of douchey boston white trash , bostonians use for new jerseyans . 
  to be fair to chuck , he has no control over that . 
  blame our fearless leader obama and secretary kerry for that . 
  pi\u0142sudski 's [ dream ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermarium ) come true !, 
  ( actually , fairly sound foreign policy on poland 's part , but you know how these things are . ), 
  the idea is that it 's better to have a system where a few criminals might go free because of a bureaucratic mistake than a system where the state can continually harass a citizen because of a single offense . 
  you ca n't compare the us or the uk with france in this regard . 
  france 's language policy can fairly be called * oppressive * . 
  no language other than french may used in an official capacity in france . 
  in the uk and us , there is no national language and non-english languages are used all the time in official capacities . 
   we walk around the city dressed in fabulous neon green yelling lietuva !, 
  at the at the top of our lungs ; make fun of estonians or something ; and go home . 
  there are worse ways to spend a month . 
  first of all , that picture does n't even show a huge disparity between the urban built-up areas between the western and eastern shores of the bosporus . 
  if you look at a map of [ istanbul province/municipality ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/istanbul_in_turkey.svg ) , the western side is obviously larger than the eastern side . 
  secondly , the population differential is huge . 
  more than [ twice as many people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_province ) live on the european part than the asian part ( 9.4 million in europe , 3.85 million in asia ) . 
  most of turkey is n't in europe , but the majority of istanbul is on the western side of the bosporus , making it pretty clearly in europe . 
   katy\u0144 * yes * . 
  came here to say this . 
  i * love * that movie .
