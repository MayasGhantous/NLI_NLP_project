  the only countries to have moral stains about rejecting jewish refugees after the war are the eastern european countries they came from , where they were subjected to pogroms , and britain , for refusing to allow the jews in dp camps to go to jewish communities in palestine . 
   i remember reading that one of the alternatives to israel was brazil . 
  some zionists thought that it would be more practical to carve out a bit of * argentina * , not brazil , than to return to the holy land , but that was discredited by world war i. 
  certainly by world war ii , zionism was 100 % focused on immigration to british palestine . 
   could this be because jews were wary of living anywhere in western europe/north america as well ? 
  possibly , but i 'm sure the fact that the west was n't exactly rolling out the welcome mat contributed to that attitude , and this probably contributes to the fact that zionism is still very much a `` thing '' . 
  it is certainly not lost on modern israelis that no country wanted to help jews , before , during , or after the war . 
  the only people to help jews were private individual gentiles , doing so secretly , and the jews themselves . 
  that 's why israelis are so insistent on why israel must exist as a refuge for jews , and why israel must continue to be explicitly * jewish * . 
  an israel that can be hijacked by non-jewish interests is useless as a refuge . 
  but not on our side of the pacific . 
  the philippines are pretty far away . 
  pretty sure we were well out of our isolation by then , having gone to war with spain to strip them of their remaining colonial possessions twenty years beforehand . 
   `` what are we going to do with all these holocaust survivors ? 
  are we going to settle them in our own countries ? '', 
  let 's dump them in a british colony filled with brown people . 
  they think it 's magic , anyway . '', 
  this is * not at all * what happened . 
  this is one of the biggest issues with public perception of the israeli-palestinian conflict . 
  nobody `` dumped '' a bunch of jews into british palestine . 
  in fact , the british tried their damnedest , before , during , and after wwii , to keep jews * out * of palestine . 
  the israeli mossad started before the establishment of the state as an organization dedicated to smuggling jews into palestine against british wishes . 
  the british kept holocaust survivors who tried to get into palestine in [ internment camps ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyprus_internment_camps ) in cyprus , for christ 's sake . 
  from one camp to another . 
  this is a hugely damaging misconception . 
  the west did n't try to fix the postwar jewish refugee problem by `` dumping '' jews into palestine . 
  the jews themselves did their best to get to palestine , while the british colonial overlords tried very hard to keep them out . 
  it is true that nobody wanted to accept jewish refugees after the war ... nobody * except the palestinian jews * . 
  they wanted them , and they accepted them , and they integrated them . 
  would you have preferred that they languished in displaced persons camps forever ? 
  or gone back to villages in poland and the ussr to be subjected to [ pogroms ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kielce_pogrom ) ? 
  ** tl ; dr ** : nobody wanted the jews to go to palestine except the jews themselves . 
  it 's not `` quite often , '' that 's like 5 people out of millions of outspoken homophobes . 
  as a gay person , i think the `` all homophobes are secretly gay '' is almost as destructive and offensive as the homophobia itself . 
  then you should n't have mentioned the bailouts at all and focused on the reforms you 're making that will make your economy more competitive . 
  okay , that 's true , but you specifically mentioned the bailouts you receive in return for doing those reforms . 
  it 's the bailout you focused on , and that is n't wealth creation , it 's money given to you by someone who did create wealth . 
  that 's not creating wealth , that 's getting charity . 
   dude how many civilizations and regimes have europeans overthrown ? 
  how did you even get to here . 
  also , the overthrow of mohammad mossadegh in iran was at the request of the british anyway . 
  how anyone could place blame for the coup unconditionally on the us is beyond me . 
  let 's remember that '53 in iran was britain 's idea and we just executed it because the british diplomats ( read : spies ) had been expelled from iran . 
  i think nation-states are generally more stable the more homogeneous they are , so if two ethnically homogeneous states of the same ethnic population want to merge , that will just make the world a stabler place . 
  go for it . 
  kind of surprised to see croatia doing better than estonia . 
  also , israel 's not doing as well as spain ? 
  that surprises me somewhat , having been to both israel and spain . 
  meidei 's the worst . 
  i am gay and i 100 % agree with you . 
  if pride parades were done in suits and ties and we did n't let people show up in bondage gear , it would be a lot easier for people outside the lgbt population to realize that stereotypical `` gay '' behavior is just that : a * stereotype * . 
  `` we 're here , we 're queer , get used to it '' might have been okay in the context of the 60s , but it 's the 21st century now , and our motto is `` we 're here , we 're gay , and we would really like to have legally-recognized monogamous relationships with one another while legally raising children '' now . 
  being gay is so mainstream it 's almost acceptable to be a gay republican again . 
  it depends on the border . 
  some borders have a nice dialect continuum , because there was n't a lot of population movement in or out of the area . 
  the case of czech and polish is very interesting : there is a dialect continuum between czech and polish on the czech republic 's northeastern border , where silesian is spoken on both sides of the border ; but there is no continuum on the northern border , where czech speakers in the formerly-german-speaking sudetenland abut speakers of eastern polish dialects in the formerly-german-speaking lower silesia . 
  the ethnic cleansing of germans from lower silesia and their replacement with poles who had been in turn ethnically cleansed from the kresy destroyed the dialect continuum . 
  maybe , but if you saw palestinian muslims at one end of the street and palestinian christians at the other end , what you would be seeing is actually a couple of levantine-looking kids at either end of the street , who could be muslim , christian , or jewish . 
  northern cyprus was majority-greek before the turkish invasion . 
  now there are no greeks there . 
  anatolian turkish settlers have been moving to north cyprus in huge numbers . 
  where do you think those turkish settlers are living ? 
  it 's worth pointing out that those christian neighbor kids might see themselves as just as `` palestinian '' ( or more ) than the muslim palestinians on the other end of the street . 
  some palestinian nationalist groups ( e.g. 
  the pflp , i think ) were founded by christians . 
  also worth pointing out that most israeli jews , christian palestinians , and muslim palestinians are physically indistinguishable from one another . 
  not really , it 's not so much a negative `` make the territories less muslim '' idea , it 's more of a positive `` make the territories more jewish '' one . 
  even if the israelis wanted to annex the entirety of the palestinian territories , that still would n't be `` cultural eradication '' because the arabs in israel enjoy full civil rights and have a flourishing society of their own . 
   little russia is actually what russians ( from great russia ) called ukraine during the empire . 
  i think too much is made of this . 
  there are literally dozens of `` greater x '' and `` lesser/little x '' geographic pairs around the world . 
  the terms `` greater poland '' and `` lesser poland '' even use the same slavic roots ( wiel - / vel - and mal - ) as `` great russia '' ( russia proper ) and `` lesser russia '' ( malorossiya : ukraine ) . 
  exactly . 
  accusing israel of `` cultural eradication '' of palestine is * ludicrous * to anyone who knows * anything * about israel . 
  edit : though , minor correction : arabic is only mandatory in some schools in israel . 
  it is not mandatory nationwide , only , i think , in some schools in the north . 
  annexation sure , but `` cultural eradication '' is a ridiculous accusation in this instance . 
  arabic is not suppressed . 
  palestinians have their own universities , their own newspapers , their own theatres . 
  in what way is palestinian culture being `` eradicated ? '', 
   yes , a lot of the criticism is one sided , but on the other hand israel is the only developed nation to be actively colonising somewhere right now . 
  who cares if they 're `` developed '' or not if they 're actively colonizing someone ? 
  that 's the principal objection that i hear from israelis . 
  crimes that are orders of magnitude worse than what israel does get much less attention in european presses because the perpetrators are not `` developed countries . '', 
  the implicit racism -- israel is `` one of us '' and therefore held to a high moral standard ; the `` undeveloped '' countries are barbarians who ca n't be held to real standards -- is objectionable enough . 
  but the perception that european objections to human rights abuses are based on ** who ** is violating human rights , and not how the rights are being violated or to what degree or on what scale , is what really drives israelis nuts . 
  palestinian persecution at the hands of other arabs is n't given nearly the same press time as israeli persecution . 
  and how much publicity do sri lankan tamils , or turkish kurds , or chechens get , compared to palestinians ? 
  is their suffering of a lesser magnitude than the palestinians ? 
  journalists err towards leftism ; the palestinians are the darlings of the left ; leftist journalists show favoritism towards the palestinians . 
  it 's not exactly rocket science . 
  not a reliable one , at least . 
  and that 's only with an ungenerous definition of `` eastern europe . '', 
  ireland is `` british '' like argentinians are `` american : '' not at all . 
  virtually everything we give the israelis is better six months later than the day it arrived in israel . 
   t\u00edr na n\u00d3g somewhere ( i think it was some book ? ), 
  um , you mean in this [ absolutely amazing tv show ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agqy9zjpnsg ) ? 
  there 's a statue of him in the boston common . 
  he 's the best . 
  well , what i meant was that they 're somehow different from hollanders and limburgers and zeelanders , etc. , but still under the umbrella term of `` dutch . '',
