  that 's the common perception . 
  the frisians and the flemish are both lumped into this `` not really 100 % but basically dutch '' group for me and for most people with cursory knowledge of the low countries . 
  i think most people would consider the netherlands to be a nation-state , as a representative of the dutch people , of whom the frisians are a sub-group . 
  you 're welcome . 
  it 's a distinction that does n't often get made in popular discourse , so it 's not really that well-known outside of academic circles . 
   could n't have put it better myself . 
  i am very happy to see that there are still people that know the difference between `` nation '' and `` state '' like you . 
  well , my $ 200,000 degree in international relations would be a waste of time if i did n't get at least something out of it . 
   one nitpick : germany is some kind of border case as though germany consists of germanic peoples , historically they have been considered seperate nations . 
  this is partly reflected in different , partly mutually intelligible , german languages . 
  this is true , though germans are now considered a single people ( `` wir sind ein volk '' and all that ) . 
  it 's important to note that `` nations '' are all self-conscious constructs , and are often informed by political divisions . 
  there 's no reason , really , why some speakers of franconian dialects are considered `` germans '' and others are considered `` dutch , '' other than the political division between them . 
  likewise , if denmark , sweden , and norway had been politically unified , we might speak of a `` scandinavian people '' instead , with danish , swedish , and norwegian dialects . 
  a nation-state is a state made up of a single ethnic majority that acts as the sovereign political expression of that ethnic group in international politics . 
  that is , the state claims to represent `` the x , y or z people . '', 
  generally speaking , these states come into being by a minority group seceding from a larger empire , but sometimes they come into being by a number of ethnically-similar states merging into one huge state . 
  israel , latvia , and croatia are examples of nation-states . 
  each claims to represent a specific ethnic/ethno-religious group ( jews , latvians , or croatians ) , and they came into existence by revolting from larger multi-ethnic empires that they felt were discriminating against their ethnic group . 
  germany is also a nation-state , which came into being by the ( coerced ) unification of german-speaking states into a single state . 
  only austria and switzerland , among the dozens of german-speaking states , were ultimately left out . 
  spain , india , and the us are not . 
  spain was formed by the political merger of the crown of castille and l\u00e9on and the crown of arag\u00f3n . 
  castilians ( that is to say , castilian-speaking spaniards ) make up the majority of the population of spain , but spain does not claim that it is the sovereign representation of castilians , or that basques , galicians , catalans , etc. 
  are not ethnically spaniards . 
  spain is a multi-ethnic empire , albeit a small one . 
   i 'd really like you to understand where i 'm coming from , do you ? 
  no , because it sounds like you want people to stop thinking of others as `` gay , '' `` bi , '' etc. , which is literally never going to happen . 
  people need a way to describe men who like men or women who feel they are men inside , and they use the words available to them . 
  this itself is a silly argument that is a waste of both of our time . 
  the most productive thing to do to reduce discrimination is go out and act normally : that is , if we just be ourselves , people will respect us for it and treat us like they 'd treat anyone else . 
  that 's what matters . 
  i think that  that way , we can bitch about that instead of actually addressing real issues , because that would take actual activism and energy !, 
  is not consistent with  that the real issue is breaking down genders so we should n't waste time with labels . 
  because whining about how we should n't be labeled is a waste of breath . 
  labeling people is what humans do , because our brains are wired to find and identify patterns . 
  labeling itself is n't bad : it 's making moral judgments based on the labels that is bad . 
  our aim should not be `` abolishing the ... labels and categories that people have created , '' but getting people to realize that gay , bi , trans , etc. 
  carry the same moral value as tall , short , ginger , etc. 
  : that is to say , none at all . 
  but while we all wait forever for human nature to change and people to stop labeling others , i think that activists should work towards actual , achievable goals , like getting parental leave for all new parents in lieu of woman-only `` maternity leave , '' or making sure that transsexuality is discussed in health classes . 
  that 's just my two cents . 
  edit : to be absolutely clear , my point is that you 're not doing anything substantially different from the people complaining that it should be `` lgbtqii '' instead of `` lgbt '' or whatever . 
  neither you nor they are discussing real , actionable policy , just moaning about terminology . 
  honestly , you sound like a bit of a fruit loop yourself in [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1uza0i/gender_is_the_new_enemy_of_the_polish_church/cen9vxq ) , so i do n't think you should be throwing stones . 
  i 'm gay and i think getting offended by `` homosexual '' is positively ridiculous . 
  people * do * need to have a thicker skin . 
  being offended about everyone and everything seems so * tiring * . 
  i am a young gay american , and i do n't say `` queer '' because it has a negative connotation to me . 
  i do know other gay people who self-identify as `` queer , '' though . 
  ~ ~ hatred ~ ~ resentment is nearly as enduring as hope . 
  i am a raging anglophile , and even i would concede that irish anti-british sentiment is not unearned . 
  i want to thank you for making this point . 
  robert shiller comes from the same population of lithuanian immigrants as my great-great-grandparents , who were lithuanian peasants who immigrated to massachusetts . 
  i have ancestors from all over northern europe , but i do identify with my lithuanian ancestors because i bear their name ( which is , confusingly , polish ) , and i do think of myself , non-exclusively , as a lithuanian-american . 
  no , massachusetts ; my step-mother is from rhode island , which fall river is right next to . 
  would you like to be the guy who raises his hand in that mob and says , `` uh , hey guys , maybe kidnapping is n't cool ? '', 
  my step-mother uses `` portugee '' as an adjective meaning `` tacky , '' like `` those fucking portugee houses with six statues of the virgin in the front yard and a horrible pink stripe down the front . '', 
  so i guess the stereotype of portuguese people in fall river is that they design their homes really poorly . 
   grammatically , the only real differences i notice from people around me are that british english seems to allow/require  * `` have you got any sausages you want cooking ? '', 
   whereas in my idiolect ( and i assume in australian english more broadly ) this has to be  `` have you got any sausages you want cooked ? '', 
  in my dialect of english ( diluted eastern new england english ) , the same thought would be expressed as : `` do you have any sausages you 'd like ( to be ) cooked ? '', 
  it sounds equally correct with or without the `` to be . '', 
  uh , well , he did say [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1uh1af/if_your_country_used_to_have_a_monarch_would_you/cei7ers ) :  yes that 's the ticket . 
  we did come close , but then changed our mind ...  do n't panic though , i 've no illusions of this approach being practiced now - but i can be nostalgic . 
   so i do n't think your hypothesis really works . 
  well , you might be getting a lot of negative votes because you 're trying to put a positive spin on genocide . 
  the deliberate , systematic killing of a specific ethnic/religious group is generally seen as evil and never necessary . 
  and the reason your argument for genocide does n't work is precisely because it * is * never necessary , because restive minorities can always be moved , instead of being killed . 
  now , ethnic cleansing , you do n't have to try hard to get people on board to support that . 
  almost all the germans were ethnically cleansed from eastern europe after world war ii . 
  how many czechs do you know that support the repatriation of the sudetendeutsch ? 
  how many poles are in favor of turning wroc\u0142aw back into breslau ? 
  do you think there are many russians who think , `` you know , it was unkind to kick the germans out of kaliningrad , we should let them all come back ? '', 
  and more recently , how many croats think that the majority of serbs expelled from that country should be let back in ? 
  all of those countries , after years of war , expelled minorities who were making separatist or irredentist claims on them . 
  and now , they do n't have any trouble with that separatist or irredentist group any more . 
  problem solved !, 
  and since none of these countries has really had to pay any price , internationally-speaking , for these expulsions , governments see it as an acceptable long-term solution . 
  if you have a restive minority , you can look at britain or israel , who try to deal with the minority that 's already there , while favoring your own group to the best of your ability , and they receive highly negative criticism for decades and decades . 
  or , you can look on the other side at the czech republic or croatia , and see that after some temporary awkwardness , the rest of the world has moved on . 
  occasionally some germans of serbs will raise the issue , but world says , `` it 's in the past : you should move on , '' and no real harm is done to the expelling country . 
  the fact is that the international community has a short memory , and ethnic cleansing has become a forgivable offense . 
  honestly , if i were a ruthless , amoral dictator , it 'd be my first option for a restive minority . 
   the british army had already been deployed to northern ireland to try and maintain order and unfortunately the irish republican community largely misinterpreted the intention of putting troops their ( uk government also takes blame for this misinterpretation ) and the situation was even further exacerbated . 
  no offense to the norn catholics , but how did they not draw the line between `` irish terrorists try to assassinate prime minister and dozens of conservative mps '' to `` prime minister brings more troops to ireland ? '', 
  the despotic monarch maybe , after a trial , but his wife ? 
  his children ? 
  his doctor ? 
  are you a monster ? 
  maybe you could pull the trigger , but i could n't . 
  killing someone 's family because of what one person did is bestial . 
  dialects of french are still around -- though it seems like all frenchmen agree that only parisian french is * proper * french -- but it is the other * languages * of france that are dead or dying : [ breton ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breton_language ) ( a celtic language ) , [ basque ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basque_language ) , [ corsican ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corsican_language ) ( a romance language related to italian ) , [ occitan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/langues_d%27oc ) ( a romance language related to catalan ) , and of course all the [ langues d'o\u00efl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/langues_d%27o%c3%afl ) other than french itself . 
  i 'm sorry , but i 'd prefer a more recent citation . 
  that article is from 12 years ago , and the context is very important : that is an american magazine , and the article was published less than a year after 9/11 . 
  there 's certainly a bias there . 
  not an ideal source , really . 
   they see themselves as the front line in the upcoming civil war and are preparing as such . 
  [ citation needed ], 
   the classic view , and the one which many -- including me -- embrace , is that king michael did what was possible in a very tight spot , when his options were very limited , and acted in the best interest of the country .
