  that 's certainly the prevailing interpretation i 've aware of , and it seems to make the most sense . 
   what is true though is that none of the traditional western allies of romania did or say anything before or after the war to support us , and , ultimately , did nothing to impede the imposition of a brutal dictatorship by the soviets . 
  i 've had this conversation with poles , lithuanians , czechs , etc. 
  before , and my question is : what could we have done ? 
  what could we possibly have done ? 
  were we expected to , upon reaching the elbe after shipping our troops 3000 miles across an ocean and meeting our erstwhile allies who did the lion 's share of the work in grinding the enemy down to nothing , immediately declare war on those erstwhile allies and try to roll them back across the european plain ? 
  no one could accuse me of sympathy for the soviets , and in all honesty , i wish that we lived in a world in which the soviets had allowed the legitimate prewar governments to return unmolested , and not rearranged the borders and governments of central and eastern europe . 
  but what do you expect us to have done , realistically ? 
  the russians were running out of men themselves : if we had declared war , they would have fought to the last pole , lithuanian , and czech to draw breath . 
  yeah , monarchy -- well , aristocracy -- did n't work out all that well last time , so that 's perfectly understandable . 
  okay , while your claim that you were not intending to be patronizing and your admission that you knew your usage of `` bub '' and `` pal '' was annoying are slightly contradictory , i 'll drop it . 
  do n't worry about it . 
   the main accusation against carol ii is of abusing his powers as a constitutional monarch : initially through manipulation of the political parties ( 1930-1938 ) , then openly overthrowing the democratic system and instituting a personal dictatorship ( 1938-1940 ) . 
   his hands-on approach eventually turned against him : he was blamed for failing to act in any way during the year 1940 while romania lost about 1/3 of its territory to claims by its neigbours . 
  fair enough . 
  he sounds like an awful leader . 
   in august 1944 , as the red army was penetrating the front in ne romania , michael i staged a palace coup against wartime leader , general ion antonescu , issued a ceasefire , and announced the acceptance of an allied armistice , on extremely harsh terms imposed by the soviets . 
   his action in 1944 is seen by some as a unnecessary capitulation in front of the soviets , and as a betrayal of the german ally . 
  so , he 's disliked because he * turned his back * on the nazis ? 
  that 's a twist . 
  or was it because he gave up before getting moldova back ? 
  i am actually subbed to / r/rugbyunion already , i just did n't think it sounded like a big deal while scanning article titles . 
  i 'll have to read more in depth . 
  i freely admit that the dutch republic was ahead of the times in terms of democratic rule , but were n't the states general put directly in charge of that `` one fifth '' of the land precisely because that was the majority-catholic territory , and they did n't want to give catholics representation in the states-general ? 
  also , til there was an [ eighth province ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drenthe ) of the republic of the seven united netherlands , but it was n't represented in the states-general because it was so poor . 
  [ what the fuck ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_five_nations_championship ) . 
  americans would 've had an apopletic fit if we entered a competition and * everyone won * . 
  i ca n't even imagine what rugby fans must 've felt like on that day . 
  good for you , wales !, 
   what if we could get , somehow , a smart man or woman with a cabinet of trustworthy educated people which ran the country woth , obviously , some minor info on the issues by the population . 
  have you read thomas hobbes ' [ leviathan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leviathan_ ( book \\ ) ) ? 
  you should . 
   edit : but i am not a very liberal and equally-thinking person . 
  do n't think i represent the wants and needs of latvians . 
  most would n't be content with a dictatorship . 
  do n't count yourself out : half of the self-identified `` liberals '' i talk to are perfectly content with using undemocratic means to achieve `` social justice '' or secure people 's `` rights . '', 
  apparently it is the [ archaic dutch spelling ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1uh1af/if_your_country_used_to_have_a_monarch_would_you/cei9d6b ) . 
  fun fact : while looking for the etymology of `` stadtholder , '' i discovered that the idiom `` last-ditch '' is [ attributed ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=last-ditch&amp;searchmode=none ) to king/stadtholder william of orange . 
  huh , well , that is unexpected . 
  wow , that is an incredible brainfart on my part . 
  you are of course correct . 
   the australian constitutional crisis is a very interesting issue , and is actually one of the reasons i advocate for the continuation of the monarchy , until such a time as the candidates become undesirable . 
  one of the ways i see the royal family is as a sort of fail safe against a nazi germany situation . 
  this is generally the explanation i give when people ask why some people might like a monarchical system , so i 'm glad to see i 'm not that far off-base . 
   king charles while i generally like elizabeth ii , i find it difficult to believe that she choice such a horrid name for the future heir to the british ( etc. ), 
  throne . 
  neither of the previous charles ' were very good role models . 
   the distinction between a constitutional monarch , a president who 's head of state but not of government and a prime minister or president who 's head of government is very small . 
  it 's there , but quite difficult to define . 
  i agree , and that is what makes comparative politics so very interesting . 
  if you want a time-limited monarchy , you should use a strong presidential system , like us !, 
  ^ ( only half-kidding ... ), 
  okay , so then i was mistaken . 
  it still seems odd that descriptions of the federal president 's position still use terms like `` ceremonial , '' though , if he 's really exercising a significant degree of control over the political process . 
  and while it is true that the queen herself has never not acted on the advice of her pm , her [ representative in australia has ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_australian_constitutional_crisis ) , using the powers she deputized to him . 
  some people have other religions . 
  well , you were a republic with a * de facto * hereditary head of state ( the stad ~ ~ t ~ ~ houder ) , so i do n't really know if that counts , but sure . 
  edit : why do we spell it stadtholder in english if it 's stadhouder in dutch ? 
  is the welsh national team good compared to the english and french national teams ? 
  ( i have a slight fascination with rugby , but as it is not really played in this country outside of colleges , i 'm kind of starting from square one . ), 
  i feel like that may be a bit of a stretch of an interpretation on how wwii ( or the rise of the nazi party ) happened . 
  if they had wanted to bring back the kaiser , why did n't they just ... invite the kaiser back ? 
  who do they want to give the crown to ? 
  i do n't speak czech , so their website is n't terribly helpful . 
  it * looks * like they intend to offer it to the hapsburgs , but i 'm not sure if i 'm correct in that assumption . 
   there is no need to get upset . 
   i do n't think i used words that could have offended you in some way . 
  and i do n't think i said anything to give you the impression that i 'm trying to change your writing style or that i 'm incredibly bothered by it . 
  but it can be interpreted as showing off , or at least that 's the way i interpreted it . 
  i 'm going to assume that english is not your first language , because if you 're being serious right now , there is a serious cultural misunderstanding concerning the tone of your posts . 
  your english is excellent , so i apologize if it is , in fact , your native language . 
  the fact is that your previous two comments are written in a way that can be easily interpreted as very patronizing . 
  what really triggered my defensive reaction was your use of `` bub '' and `` pal '' to end sentences . 
  this comes off as * incredibly * patronizing in english . 
  i know this is not true in every language , but in english , one generally does this only to children . 
  it 's literally ** patr ** onizing , because `` bub '' and `` pal '' are nicknames that dads commonly use for their kids . 
  using these nicknames with people who you do n't know very well comes off as belittling . 
  in the previous comment , your sarcastic quip about the world coming to an end was also very dismissive , so i interpreted it as maliciously funny instead of simply flippant . 
  i apologize if i misinterpreted your comments and you were not , in fact , deliberately being an asshole . 
  but i do stand by my interpretation as not being without basis . 
  and i like using foreign words when discussing foreign topics because sometimes the translations are n't what you might necessarily think . 
  if you are learning german and want to talk about the `` states '' of germany , you should n't say * staaten * , despite the fact that that is a perfectly fine translation of `` states , '' and if you were talking about the states of the usa , then you would use * staaten * . 
  but if you 're talking about german states , you should be talking about * l\u00e4nder * . 
  you see what i 'm getting at ? 
  the occasional usage of foreign terms makes language learning easier and does n't seem to confuse conversation that much in the language of conversation . 
  edit : and for the record , i 'm not downvoting you . 
  well , what powers the law gives you and what powers you use in a specific way are not necessarily the same . 
  what matters is generally how the powers are used : whether the individual has lots of discretion or whether he or she generally does what is requested of him or her . 
  is it seen as a partisan decision , like `` right-leaning people are generally monarchist and left-leaning people are not , '' or is it a minority on both sides ? 
  murder them all , including the children , and force all of their relatives into exile ? 
   you just answered you own question , bub . 
  there are english words that are equivalents of the foreign ones , or you could use words we 're more familiar with . 
  just writing words in the foreign language wo n't impress anybody here , pal . 
  why are you being such an asshole about a decision that does n't impact your life at all ? 
  seriously . 
  i broke convention because i like using foreign words , and you 're being a huge dick about it . 
   and if you wanted to be more accurate , why did you only use the name `` juan carlos '' instead of his full name `` juan carlos alfonso v\u00edctor mar\u00eda de borb\u00f3n y borb\u00f3n-dos sicilias '' ? 
  because i use monarch 's first names ? 
  i idiosyncratically broke convention in one instance , but in this stance , i used the english-language convention of referring to a monarch by his first name ( as with elizabeth , or willem-alexander ) . 
  why is it so divisive , if i may ask ?
