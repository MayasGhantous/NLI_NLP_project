   how is `` pr\u00e9sident '' more accurate than `` president '' ? 
  because it 's french , for a french title ? 
   why do you need more accuracy ? 
  because i want to ? 
   oh the horror ... imagine if somebody would confuse `` premier ministre '' with `` prime minister '' and they would believe that they both mean the same thing but are written in different languages . 
  the world as we know it will come to an abrupt end . 
  what if it were n't the `` pr\u00e9sident '' of france or the `` bundespr\u00e4sident '' of germany that i were talking about ? 
  what if it were the president of israel ? 
  he 's not the \u05e4\u05e8\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3\u05e0\u05d8 ( `` president '' ) : he 's the \u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 ( nasi hamedina , `` president of the state '' ) . 
  what about the pm of israel , the \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d4\u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05d4 ( rosh hamemshalah , `` head of the government '' ) ? 
  how many people would instinctively recognize the hebrew terms `` nasi '' or `` rosh hamemshalah ? '', 
  by using the original titles , i give everyone a little language lesson while also being clear about who i 'm talking about . 
  edit : made a typo in my hebrew spelling of `` president . '', 
  some people find it comforting to have an institution that is part of the state , but which remains apolitical and which can be supported by the entire population , not just the part of the population that finds this or that policy desirable . 
  i do n't think i would vote for a monarchy in the us , but i do n't find it that odd when others vote to restore a monarchy . 
   as a german i have to disagree . 
  he has the right/duty to verify whether laws are in accordance to the constitution and if he thinks a law is not , he can essentially veto it ; this happened 8 times so far . 
  so does the queen of the uk , who actually has broad-ranging powers and just chooses not to use them , except by request from parliament , as tradition . 
  that being said , commentators generally agree that the british queen and the german president are ceremonial roles . 
  wait , really ? 
  that is nuts . 
  was there support for a reinstitution of the monarchy , or was everyone just like , `` well , he 's fine for a republican leader but no king for us ? '', 
  i have no idea how the monarchy ( or , let 's be honest , really anything ) is perceived in bulgaria . 
  17.7 % is a pretty hefty chunk of the country , though it is completely outweighed by the 60 + % of the country that wants various forms of republican governance . 
  what did carol ii and michael i do , exactly ? 
  good to know . 
  grading systems anywhere are not particularly intuitive . 
  he looked [ really similar ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/kaiser_wilhelm_ii_and_germany_1890_-_1914_hu68367.jpg ) to his cousin [ tsar nicholas ii ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/mikola_ii.jpg ) , though not particularly like his other cousin [ king-emperor george vi ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/king_george_vi_of_england%2c_formal_photo_portrait%2c_circa_1940-1946.jpg ) . 
  edit : wrong king-emperor george : / u/lazar-taxon has the [ right george ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1uh1af/if_your_country_used_to_have_a_monarch_would_you/ceia7rs ) . 
  good things come to those who wait !, 
   our constitutional history is not really quiet ( it 's an euphemism ) . 
  we made a lot of experimentations ( the first republic , the restoration , second republic , the end of the second empire , the commune , etc. ) . 
  the fifth republic gave us an institutional stability . 
  in 4 years , it 'll be our longest political regime since 1789 . 
  but also , it never had to deal with a war . 
  all of our previous regimes failed , in one way or another , because of a war . 
  so , all we have to do is get you in a war and see what happens !, 
   the affirmation of duverger is less true today . 
  with the last constitutional reform of 2008 , the powers of the opposition have been strengthened and our supreme court , the constitutional council , can control the legislation a posteriori , etc. 
  i would say it 's `` less worse '' now . 
  that is good . 
  honestly , i have no memory of that happening , but i was just graduating high school and did n't really care about the rest of the world at that point . 
  how do french people feel about their political system ? 
  because i enjoy doing so , and so that i can use the most accurate title of the position i 'm talking about ? 
  it seems like the clubs are in the right here , but i do n't know the other end of it , i guess . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  are the red ones failing grades ? 
  okay , i had to google translate and i 'm still not getting what that graph is trying to say . 
  there are no labels on the y-axis !, 
   most of us are republicans , but still , we have a slight tendency to look for the `` providential saviour '' such as napoleon , p\u00e9tain or de gaulle for instance . 
  yeah , we talked about this in my european security class . 
  my professor was ... not terribly positive about this . 
  she flippantly compared it to the desire of russians for a `` strong leader , '' and noted that the fifth french republic is younger than india , israel , and the philippines . 
   maurice duverger , a famous professor of law , called our fifth republic the `` republican monarchy '' because of some characteristics in our constitution , giving extended powers to the president of the republic . 
  indeed , the fifth republic does look like a constitutional monarchy where the monarch has devolved most powers onto a parliament but retains substantial power for himself . 
   in rugby everything continues to go wrong . 
  the regions have [ refused to sign ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/25562387 ) the welsh rugby union 's participation agreement . 
  the union then [ wrote to member clubs ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/25594393 ) explaining their position . 
  the letter was [ condemned by the regions ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/25606481 ) . 
  [ all bbc ] . 
  what is the source of the disagreement between the clubs and the wru ? 
  edit : i ca n't really make heads nor tails out of the bbc article . 
  do the monarchists have some support in the general population , or is it like in france , where there are monarchists but they 're a tiny fringe group ? 
  i 'll look into it . 
  that 's interesting that the prince ( i assume , the heir ) is rated as having higher approval ratings than the king . 
  my brother made it seem like people did n't like felipe but like juan carlos . 
  still , it seems like most of the functions of the monarchy have high approval ratings . 
  also , i 've never taken spanish , but i can still understand the graphs !, 
   in any case , the queen still controls parts of the country for strategic brown people bombing purposes , and so does the successor state to the ottoman empire , so it 's as if little has changed now that we are a republic . 
  yeesh , that 's a pretty bleak outlook . 
   thanks . 
  ah , then princess sophie of lichtenstein [ 1 ] would be queen of scotland . 
  queen sophie , chatting with queen elizabeth - it could be nice . 
  she has four sons too , so the succession is taken care of for a while . 
  and , has studied english . 
  sounds perfect !, 
  that might create some awkwardness when scotland enters into personal union with liechtenstein , though . 
   oh , there seem to be a lot of those . 
  i found this one , the duke of anjou who at least grew up in spain , albeit madrid . 
  it is better than paris i suppose ( or maybe not ... ) i think the basques , like the catalans , are pretty republican-minded in their desire for independence , and a * spanish * monarch would really rankle . 
  i knew france had `` legitimate '' claimants to the throne so i threw it in there , but to my understanding , france is very heavily republican . 
  every frenchman i 've ever met is anti-monarchist to some extent , more so than americans ( who seem ambivalent about other people 's monarchies ) . 
  ( by the way , it 's `` restoration , '' as in `` restore , '' not `` restauration '' as in `` restaurant . '' ), 
  well , i ca n't really argue against that position , my country having done the same thing . 
  from your flair i assume you 're italian , right ? 
  that 's a legitimate concern . 
  the `` bad emperor problem '' is found in every monarchy . 
  just curious : what kind of head of state would you prefer to see in spain ? 
  in the us , for instance , the president is both head of government and head of state ; in france , there is a distinction between pr\u00e9sident ( head of state ) and premier ministre ( head of government ) , but the pr\u00e9sident nonetheless wields a lot of power ; in germany , the bundespr\u00e4sident ( head of state ) is a ceremonial role , while the bundeskanzler ( in ) ( head of government ) wields all the actual power . 
  does the abolition of the monarchy have much support in spain ? 
  my brother studied abroad there and seems to think that , while juan carlos himself has immense personal prestige , the monarchy itself is n't all that popular ; but i read a poll the other day that indicated that almost 80 % of the population approves of the monarchy . 
  well , i guess if you 've been a relatively minor possession under a rotating door of monarchs who never much caed for you , then there 's no real sentimental attachment to the monarchy . 
  so , it makes sense that you 're not into a restoration . 
  for what it 's worth , the current [ jacobite ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacobitism ) claimant to the thrones of scotland ( etc. ), 
  is the [ duke of bavaria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz,_duke_of_bavaria ) . 
  i thought the current scottish plan was to keep the queen as sovereign , like canada or australia , though . 
  as for the basques , i guess they had a king in the [ king of navarre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_of_navarre ) , but the kingdom was absorbed into aragon and then into france ( with the accession of henri de navarre to the french throne ) , so arguably any of the various claimants to the french throne could claim the kingdom of navarre . 
  why are the czechs so euro-skeptic ? 
  is there any specific policy of the eu that they resent ? 
  very short life ?
