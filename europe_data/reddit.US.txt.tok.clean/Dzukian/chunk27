  the only one we 're missing is an openly-gay cabinet secretary , but that 's only a matter of time . 
  i do n't see why `` the new guy fucked up the combination on the safe too many times and it literally blew up in his face '' is * that * unbelievable of an explanation . 
  given that a ) the palestinian civil service is not well-known for its professionalism and competence , and b ) the ambassador was a lower-level functionary of no strategic importance , incompetence seems like the most reasonable explanation , not malice . 
   it 'll be interesting to see the conclusion they come with . 
  when it 's palestinian political figures and diplomats , mossad 's always a suspicious one , lest we forget their numerous assassinations of people in similar cases . 
  indeed , and if there 's anyone in europe with expertise on using bombs to assassinate people , it 's the irish , so i trust your judgment . 
  in all seriousness though , what motive would israel have for killing this guy ? 
  he 's a low-level representative of the palestinian government that israel actually works with ( pa-fatah , not pa-hamas ) , and he 's not even the emissary to an important country . 
  what does israel ( who the israelis presume will obviously be blamed , by at least someone ) stand to gain from assassinating the ambassador to some small central european country ? 
  israel can be petty sometimes , but this just seems like way too much effort to kill someone of so little strategic worth . 
   could just be a simple fuck up , but i 'd like to know how large the explosive charge on the safe is , one would think they 'd have it just big enough to destroy documents , not kill people . 
  that 's a tough question , since the explosives would have to obliterate the documents entirely , or at least destroy them quickly enough that no part of them could be used . 
  a half-destroyed document is a half-usable one , so if the point of the explosives are to make the documents completely unreadable , they 'd have to make the explosives more powerful than might otherwise be necessary , so that the documents are destroyed both immediately and completely . 
  i suspect that most countries ' intelligence services would prefer the minor diplomatic awkwardness of someone 's hands get blown off ( especially someone who breached diplomatic protocol to illegally obtain documents ) to any of those documents getting stolen in a usable format . 
   i 'm sorry if that was the impression i gave you . 
  i do n't think negatively of people who served in the military . 
  oh , you did not give me that impression !, 
  my initial reading of your post was obviously a misunderstanding . 
   my view is just , that people from lower-middle class and up can afford sending their kids to higher education institutions , and reasons to join the military , would probably not include going to college , but the reasons can be old army or navy traditions in the family , trying to do a difference and a lot of other ones . 
  i very much agree . 
  although , given how expensive college has become , it could be more of a motivation for lower-middle - and middle-class people to join the military . 
  that 'd be a more recent development , though . 
  oh , maybe . 
  i ca n't speak to their motivations , but i can point out that the military is not disproportionately from poor households , rather the opposite . 
  and i 'm sorry for being defensive : i misunderstood your comment and overreacted a little . 
  my dad was an army officer who came from a solidly middle-class family , and his cohorts at military school all came from well-to-do southern families , so i get a bit prickly when i ( even mistakenly ) assume that someone is disparaging my dad 's chosen profession . 
  i work at a business school , and i can tell you there are plenty of sexy bankers . 
  i would like to point out that the us military is * not * a repository for the nation 's poor . 
  it 's not just `` poor people moving up . '', 
  it 's a perfectly respectable career for middle class and upper class americans , too . 
  there 's no more up-to-date information , but [ here ] ( http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2008/08/who-serves-in-the-us-military-the-demographics-of-enlisted-troops-and-officers ) is a report from 2008 on the demographics of the us army . 
  here 's the relevant excerpt :  every income category above $ 40,000 per year is overrepresented in the active-duty enlisted force , while every income category below $ 40,000 a year is underrepresented . 
  low-income families are significantly underrepresented in the military . 
  u.s. military enlistees disproportionately come from upper-middle-class families . 
   members of america 's volunteer army are not enlisting because they have no other economic opportunities . 
  most recruits come from relatively affluent families and would likely earn above-average wages if they did not join the military . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.heritage.org/static/reportimages/045130a94ee437e6d7284160bbaa2862.gif ) is the relevant graph , displaying the percentage of 2006/2007 army recruits that come from given income levels , and the delta between that percentage and the percentage of the general population in those income levels . 
  insufficiently british : the leftentant on the left is not captain wales . 
   different turkish tribes inhabited asia minor before the byzantine . 
  ancient greeks live in today 's greece . 
  greeks and turks are a different ethnicity . 
  the byzantine , much like rome had various ethnicities within it 's borders . 
  the greeks were mostly in greece . 
  the turkish migration to anatolia was in the early second millennium ad , by which time greeks had been living throughout anatolia for more than a millennium themselves . 
   many eastern europeans ( russians , ukrainians ) are even paler then swedes or norwegians . 
  i do n't think slavs or eastern europeans are not white . 
  i think they 're very obviously white . 
  you 're the one arguing that `` culture '' matters when discussing race . 
  if it 's the case that greeks are `` white '' because of their `` white '' facial feature while turks are `` not white '' because of their `` not-white '' facial features , as you are arguing , then i do n't understand why you 're having difficulty understanding why someone else ( again , * not me * , but theoretically , someone else ) might make the argument that slavs are `` not white '' because of their `` not white '' facial features . 
   greeks and turks look differently . 
  not different enough for me to say they 're not of the same race . 
   western and eastern europeans do n't have significant physical differences . 
  this is fairly obviously untrue , since even i can identify physical features that are stereotypically `` slavic , '' or `` germanic '' or `` french . '', 
  it 's not cut-and-dry , but there are phenotypes typical of various european populations . 
  saying `` these phenotypes with skin tone x are ` white ' '' but `` these phenotypes with skin tone x are ` not white ' '' does n't really make any sense to me . 
   one more thing-go tell a greek he looks turkish and see what happens . 
  well , i 've spoken to greeks , turks , and lebanese people about this or related subjects , and most of them agreed that eastern mediterranean peoples all look pretty similar . 
  a couple of them have been like `` oh , that 's silly , we look nothing alike , bla bla bla , '' but most acknowledge the close ethnic kinship between them . 
   umm it 's not arbitrary . 
  they have different facial features . 
  not really . 
  most turks are , in fact , the descendants of turkified greek anatolians . 
  they 're really the same population , like serbs and croats . 
  there is a self-conscious * national * distinction , based on language and religion , but there is not really an * ethnic * difference between them . 
  the point that i am trying to make is that the distinction between `` greek '' and `` turkish '' facial features , despite both having the same basic skin tone , makes greeks `` white '' and turks `` non-white , '' is just as arbitrary as the distinction between `` pale '' skin making one `` white '' and `` olive '' skin making one `` non-white . '', 
  my argument is that race is essentially an arbitrary distinction based purely on skin color , while you are the one bringing cultural components into the distinctions between `` races , '' but you 're not being any * less * arbitrary in your distinctions . 
   you sure about that ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i 'm not brown . 
  at all . 
  nor do i know anyone italian who is actually brown . 
  like really . 
  i do n't know how pale you are ( maybe you 're irish or something ) but i 'm pretty sure that if i were in america you 'd only recognize me because of my accent . 
  i 'm a mix of various northern european ethnicities -- lithuanian , swedish , english , scottish , french , and irish -- and i am pretty pale , but that 's irrelevant . 
  and i was being sarcastic when i said that `` y' all look pretty brown to me : '' the point is that race is often arbitrarily decided to mean `` people i do n't like who are a shade darker than i am . '', 
  to britons , that means frenchmen ; to northern europeans , that means southern and eastern europeans ; to southern europeans , that means north africans and levantines ; to levantines and north africans , that means bedouins ; to bedouins , that means black africans . 
  everyone considers themselves `` white '' and the people they do n't like as `` less white . '', 
  the implication of op 's comment was that `` eastern europeans and slavs '' might be perceived or treated as `` non-white '' in some european countries . 
  i 'm not an expert , but it would not be hard to believe that it may be the case that , just like you make the distinction between greeks ( `` white '' ) and turks ( `` non-white caucasians '' ) based on their facial features , other western europeans may make the distinction between western europeans ( `` white '' ) and slavic eastern europeans ( `` non-white caucasians '' ) based on their facial features rather than on their skin tone . 
   well not anyone with pale-ish skin is exactly white . 
  turks , arabs and berbers and whoever else you mentioned is part of the caucasian race but i would not exactly classify them as white . 
  they are the brown part of white people meaning they are n't actually white . 
  if you 're making that totally arbitrary distinction between greeks and turks ( who are , let 's be honest , pretty much indistinguishable , physically-speaking ) , why not make the same distinction between northern italians and southern italians ? 
  y' all look pretty `` brown '' compared to me . 
  um , okay , firstly i need to clarify that * i * do not believe that italians are not white . 
  race is a construct based on visual perception , so anyone with pale-ish skin is `` white . '', 
  europeans are all white , as are turks , arabs , berbers , iranians , and many indians . 
  there 's not a clear-cut distinction in skin tone between `` white '' and `` non-white , '' so basically it 's a gut feeling based on the amount of melanin in someone 's skin . 
  i do n't personally know anybody who thinks italians , greeks , or spaniards are n't white . 
  a hefty proportion of the population in this part of the us ( new england ) is italian , and we all pretty much agree that we 're all white . 
  i do n't know which americans you 've been talking to , because around here , it is the consensus that all mediterranean-looking people are `` white . '', 
  it is the `` old-timey super-racists '' that i mentioned who did not consider any non-germanic ( or french , i guess ) peoples to be `` white . '', 
  now , as for italy never being attacked by non-europeans , that 's just not true .
