  the whole of sicily was under muslim arab-berber control for more than a hundred years . 
  * rome was [ sacked by arabs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sack_of_rome_ ( 846 \\ ) ) in 846 , with st. peter 's basilica being plundered . 
  there was no long-lasting non-european control over the italian peninsula itself , making any accusations of italians being `` non-european '' rather silly , but it 's not accurate to say that italy was never attacked by non-europeans . 
  * side note : til that palermo was the second-largest city in europe after cordoba for a while , and when cordoba 's population dropped , palermo became the largest city , with 350,000 people !, 
  i do n't pretend to be an expert on racism ( though / u/anoldhope , a regular user on / r/askhistorians , is a historian who specializes in racism and white supremacy , so you could ask him ) , so i do n't know why the line between `` white '' and `` non-white '' was drawn where it was . 
  i think saying that italy is one of the most ethnically preserved european countries may be a bit of an exaggeration , though , since much of northern and western europe was never ruled or inhabited by non-europeans . 
  the british isles , france , the low countries , germany , scandinavia , poland , lithuania , and latvia ( and finland and estonia , if you count them as `` european '' ) have never been ruled or inhabited by any significant number of non-europeans . 
  iberia ( during the period of al-andalus ) and the balkan peninsula ( which experienced large-scale turkish immigration in the 17th-19th centuries ) are really the only parts of europe that have been ruled or inhabited by any significant number of non-europeans . 
  it 's worth pointing out that most italian immigrants to america came from southern italy and sicily , not northern italy . 
  southern italy was poorer and people there had fewer economic prospects , so they emigrated . 
  northern italians , who look less `` mediterranean '' and more `` northern european , '' mostly stayed in italy . 
  so the characteristics assigned to `` italians '' in america are associated with southern italians . 
  to old-timey super-racists , italians and other southern europeans were not `` white , '' let alone slavs , who were perceived as `` asiatic . '', 
  it 's worth pointing out that the union of the crowns ( that is , when england and scotland began to be ruled by the same monarch ) started with the accession of a scottish monarch to the english throne . 
  the current british monarchy is as much scottish as it is english . 
   let 's assume that not all subjects loved their habsburgs . 
  at least in romania , there was/is some mythology related to m-t , her sex drive , and love of horses , and a legend that her death was a result of such . 
  in america , at least , the `` queen who got fucked to death by a horse '' is apocryphally [ catherine the great of russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catherine_the_great ) . 
  it 's interesting that this story is told about more than one famous empress . 
  huh , well , i learned something today . 
  thanks for the information !, 
  it certainly does surprise me . 
  our primary ally is almost certainly * canada * , not the uk . 
  the uk probably comes in second . 
   so it 's the catch all clause for justifying federal action that supercedes state law everywhere for everyone ? 
  that 's about the size of it . 
   i know you probably hear this a lot about other legal issues in the us , but someone really should try to fix that law ... 
  yes , we should . 
  the increasingly imperial nature of the presidency would be much less dangerous were the power of the federal government generally to be restrained . 
  yes , though it is not merely to create economic infrastructure , and * that * is where the problem arises . 
  the tl ; dr version of the recent `` health care reform '' mandate that forces every american to purchase health insurance with a specific set of minimum requirements was justified using the commerce clause , with the logic that since americans cross state lines , their health may be regulated by the federal government . 
  essentially , the federal government can now use the commerce clause to issue legislation on * anything * in the us , which is not , constitutionally , how the us was designed to work . 
  this is generally true , but regional identity is quite strong . 
  i identify first as a new englander and then as an american in a very close second . 
  `` southern , '' `` cascadian , '' `` texan , '' and `` californian '' identities are generally pretty strong too . 
  irrelevant to the topic , but in what world are apia , suva , and port-vila `` major capitals '' while jerusalem , tehran , islamabad , and hanoi are not ? 
  ooh , okay . 
  huh . 
  england was not a part of normandy : rather , the duke of normandy was simultaneously king of england . 
  can i ask an honest question ? 
  what , if any , legal legitimacy did de gaulle have for claiming leadership of france ? 
  the way i was taught , de gaulle essentially unilaterally declared himself the new government of france after the legitimate french state capitulated to the germans . 
  unlike the polish , dutch , or czechoslovak governments in exile , de gaulle had no legal power to exercise control over the instruments of french government . 
  he performed a coup in exile , and the allies just decided that the nazi-collaborating government was `` illegitimate '' because the legitimate french government was an enemy country . 
  it was convenient for the us and uk to pretend that vichy france was not the legitimate french government , to rally loyal frenchmen to their own banner , but de gaulle did not exactly have any legal authority . 
  obviously , the us and the uk were not about to immediately accept the authority of some random , unelected french general as the natural leader of france when he created his government-in-exile out of nothing . 
  as a frenchman , how do you see de gaulle 's rise to leadership of `` free france '' during the war ? 
  what happens in diablo ii in 1688 ? 
  i 've never played that game . 
  everyone wants to party like it 's 1688 !, 
  aside from [ galicia and lodomeria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_galicia_and_lodomeria ) , vojvodina , bukovina , and transylvania ... 
  yes . 
  israel 's pretty chummy with cyprus and romania , and increasingly greece since turkey has decided to go full arab . 
  the uk was the result of two unions which each united two kingdoms : the 1707 union which united england and scotland into great britain , and the 1808 union which united great britain and ireland into the united kingdom of great britain and ireland . 
  wales was not a separate kingdom , but rather a part of the kingdom of england ( and then gb , and the uk ) . 
  o come all ye faithful gets sung in a lot of languages -- i have a couple of english-language christmas albums with that song in french , german , and a * lot * in latin . 
  it 's the only song i know all the lyrics to in latin . 
  i do n't think so , since stereotypically `` rednecks '' are from the bible belt , and the tone of the comment seems to indicate that americans outside the bible belt * do * kiss friends on the mouth . 
  i live in new england and i have never , not once , seen anyone kiss a friend on the mouth as a greeting . 
   i actually grew up in the canary islands , and not even a creative interpretation of geography can be used to pretend that they are `` in europe or north america '' . 
  of course , if there was an actual attack on the canary islands ( population : over two million , including plenty of citizens from other nato countries ) , it would be politically very difficult for at least the european members of nato to deny assistance to spain . 
  but there is no legal obligation , i 'm afraid ... you quoted article 5 of the north atlantic treaty , but [ article 6 ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm ) is quite informative :  for the purpose of article 5 , an armed attack on one or more of the parties is deemed to include an armed attack :  * on the territory of any of the parties in europe or north america , on the algerian departments of france ( 2 ) , ** on the territory of or on the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the parties in the north atlantic area north of the tropic of cancer ** ;  * on the forces , vessels , or aircraft of any of the parties , when in or over these territories or any other area in europe in which occupation forces of any of the parties were stationed on the date when the treaty entered into force or the mediterranean sea or the north atlantic area north of the tropic of cancer . 
  the canaries are north of the tropic of cancer , ergo they are part of the territory covered by the north atlantic treaty and an attack on the canaries would legally obligate nato members to respond . 
  i do n't know why this would be a `` fraught question '' in spain , since it is pretty clear that the canaries are part of the north atlantic area covered by the nat . 
   also , there is a difference between 1948 agreement and the 1967 borders . 
  here is a picture [ 1 ] the partition plan was passed in 1947 , not 1948 . 
  partition plan `` borders '' are referred to as `` 1947 lines '' despite never having actually existed in fact . 
  `` 1948 lines '' and `` 1967 lines '' both refer to the same lines : the cease-fire lines that existed between the end of the war of independence and the 1967 six-day war . 
  the puritans who originally settled new england and basically made fun illegal were calvinists . 
   we 're not saints but our more pragmatic rather than ideological approach to most of the values the us follows seems to have worked out pretty well so far . 
  we have good democracies which are being continually reformed and improved , which is juxtaposed to the us 's rigid model which has hardly been changed in decades ( that 's a compliment as well as a criticism ) . 
  your democracies in continental europe are `` continually reformed and improved '' because you either a ) just got democracy in the last century and consequently do n't have a whole lot of experience in it , like all of eastern and central europe , or b ) ca n't seem to find a system that is durable , like france . 
  we managed to create a democratic system in the 1700s that has lasted basically intact -- with a gradual expansion of the franchise -- for more than 200 years . 
   and then we ( british imperial forces from canada ) invaded and burned the white house to the ground . 
  that was kind of a wake up call for the us . 
  i agree with pretty much everything you say , but i need to say that this is wrong . 
  the british troops that burned down the white house were * not * canadian . 
  they were british , shipped over from britain via bermuda . 
  `` defence '' is the british spelling and `` defense '' is the american spelling . 
   the conflict is a major source for instability in the mena area , constantly putting grist on muslim extremists ' mills , further driving people to flee their home countries . 
  `` major source for instability '' is * hugely * overstating the problem . 
  it has an extremely limited effect outside of israel , the palestinian territories , and the parts of lebanon and jordan inhabited by palestinians . 
  it has not really caused any large-scale regional conflicts in decades , though . 
  jordan and egypt both actively cooperate with israel ; saudi arabia and the gulf states have interests that broadly dovetail with israel 's , so they have no reason to fight with israel ; and everyone else is too removed to care . 
  the israeli-palestinian conflict ( really , the palestinian refugee camps , which only exist because arab countries refuse to allow palestinians to integrate , even after living in their countries for generations ) has catalyzed civil wars in jordan and lebanon , but those were fairly limited conflicts . 
  ( edit : the lebanese civil war was not `` limited '' in terms of body count , but it was n't as significant as the iran-iraq war , and the syrian civil war has turned out much more disastrous in much less time . ), 
  as for what muslim extremists really care about , * follow the violence * . 
  how many iraqis , syrians , libyans , algerians , etc. 
  were flowing into palestine to fight the jews ? 
  practically none . 
  but how many jihadis are now flowing into syria to fight the shia heretics ? 
  thousands . 
  the sunni-shia divide , and iran 's attempts to establish a `` shia crescent '' from iran to lebanon are the seriously destabilizing force in the middle east . 
  the sunni-shia religious war -- with serious political consequences -- is what really animates the muslim extremists . 
  a handful of jews oppressing the palestinians ( who are not well-loved themselves by other arabs ) is just not rustling jimmies like the idea of the shia regaining control over iraq , syria , and lebanon . 
  do russians realize that the faggy queens are the most visible part of the gay community * because other gay people are indistinguishable from straight russians * ? 
  the bizarre part is that the parts of the country most dramatically changed in demographics by the armenian ( / assyrian/greek ) genocide became mostly * kurdish * after the loss of the armenian population , not majority-turkish . 
  the point of nato is to defend against russia . 
  expanding nato into the former ussr-occupied countries makes nato 's position against russia stronger , which makes russia * less * likely to declare war first . 
  i hope that you are right , but i 'm not terribly optimistic .
