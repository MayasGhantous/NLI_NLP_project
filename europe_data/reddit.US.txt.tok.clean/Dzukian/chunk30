  do you have a better suggestion as to how the interests of less-populated regions should be protected ? 
  the densely-populated regions already have an overwhelming control over the lower house and the election of the president . 
  giving less-populated states an equal say in the upper house allows people in less populated states to protect themselves from being exploited by the masses on the coasts . 
  remember , the united states is a federation of nominally sovereign states . 
  the constitution was designed to ensure that the most populous states would n't be able to trample over the rights of the less populous states . 
  the upper house is where each * state * has an equal say . 
  the populations are n't being represented in the senate : the states are . 
  it 's not about ensuring that `` rural areas '' have a say , since some less-populous states are highly urban , like rhode island , delaware , or hawaii . 
  it 's about ensuring that every state is , at some point in the lawmaking process , given equal say in what laws are made . 
  * some * people do live there , and they do not deserve to be ignored just because they live far away from densely-populated regions . 
  we have * huge * oil reserves in the dakotas . 
  are the people who keep the oil flowing not an important part of our economy ? 
  i have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  those are n't stereotypes . 
  they 're truths . 
  they could be arrested , sure , but they would be arrested by municipal police officers who were enforcing a federal warrant . 
  but the same effect could be had if massachusetts or california issued a warrant for his arrest . 
  it depends on the state , but mutual extradition treaties between european states would also have the same effect . 
  and actually , the contest between what the federal wants to enforce in the states and what the states * allow * the federal government to do has been a source of tension ever since the constitution was drafted . 
  the states of the us are nominally sovereign entities that have agreed to allow the federal government a certain amount of control over them by agreeing to the us constitution , in much the same way that eu states agree to concede certain powers to the eu by signing the various eu treaties . 
  obviously , over time the federal government has arrogated more and more power to itself , but constitutionally , federal law is not really * supposed * to `` overrule the states , '' except in certain limited areas that the states have agreed to allow the federal government to legislate for them . 
  the biggest area in which the federal government can overrule the states would be `` inter-state commerce , '' which the federal government has interpreted to mean `` literally everything we do , including simply existing , '' but which states obviously interpret in a much more limited fashion . 
  last time i checked , the us army was not being sent into illinois to force their shitty politicians to * not * bankrupt the state with enormous pension payments , but sure . 
  or natural gas from israel and cyprus could , in the next few years , start pumping from the eastern mediterranean into europe . 
  but i guess if you 'd rather rely on iranian largesse , that 's up to you . 
  and now that the jews and the irish are out of the mob business , the italian mafia is the largest and most identifiable aspect of organized crime in the us . 
  people in new england joke about italians being mafiosi * all the time * . 
  certainly the vast majority of the israeli scientific community is . 
   the word chief was taken from french . 
  later chef ( cook ) was taken from french again with another meaning . 
  the same is true of `` warden '' ( norman french ) and `` guardian '' ( parisian french ) . 
  or , in english :  adam ** fucked me over ** to the boss , saying that i ** fucked up ** the printer , while he himself is constantly ** fucking around ** at work and ** fucking off ** early . 
  one day i will ** fuck him up ** and i do n't care if they * shitcan * me . 
  i ca n't think of any good ways to say `` fire '' by using `` fuck , '' so i had to substitute another curseword instead . 
  i have failed . 
  even in tel aviv , nobody drives on yom kippur , during passover everything is dead , etc. . to be sure , tel aviv is less overtly religious and more decidedly secular than jerusalem , but i think tel aviv is still more religious than much of western europe . 
  i studied israel and briefly lived there , so i will offer my impressions of that country . 
  whether or not the country is `` european '' depends on what characteristics you consider to be `` european , '' so i will try to be as broad as possible . 
  the differences : * religion : obviously , the biggest cultural difference between israel and europe is that the majority of israel 's population is jewish , not christian . 
  europe has for most of the past couple millennia been linked deeply with christianity , and israel is not a part of that tradition . 
  what 's more , israelis do not share the antipathy to institutional religion that is maintained to various degrees by western europeans . 
  most israelis are not deeply religious , but jewish traditions are maintained by a huge majority of the jewish population . 
  holidays like yom kippur and passover are taken much more seriously by the average israeli than are christian holidays by the average spaniard , briton , or german . 
  * the military : the next obvious difference between israel and ( again , mostly western ) europeans is the profoundly different lessons that they took from the horrors of wwi and wwii . 
  europeans saw millions die because of state-to-state combat and decided that the clashes between nation-states held too high a cost to ever be repeated , so military conflicts need to be prevented at virtually any cost . 
  the israelis , on the other hand , saw millions die and could do nothing about it because they had no army to save themselves -- or at least fight to a valiant end . 
  their lesson was that the jewish people must never be left defenseless again , and therefore they 've armed themselves and act to defend themselves . 
  while israelis do n't * like * war and want to spare their children the horror of war , they certainly recognize the necessity of military might in a way that most europeans perceive as `` stuck in the past . '', 
  the similarities : * socialism : like france , italy , spain , and the nordics , israel has a strong socialist party in its national politics . 
  the labor party in israel held power for almost 30 years after independence , and was extremely strong until the labor party made the first major agreements with the palestinians , and subsequent violence against israelis by palestinians tainted the image of labor in israel . 
  * the west : israel sees itself as an integral part of the west . 
  much like europe , american cultural influences are everywhere : american music plays in clubs , american shows air on tv , etc. . like europeans , israelis have a sort of love-hate relationship with the idea of the west : they like to assert their own sovereignty and the uniqueness of their culture , but they begrudgingly acknowledge that they share interests with americans and europeans on a broad range of issues . 
  the israeli right in particular is fond of telling people that israel is ( to paraphrase ) a bastion of civilization in a barbarous region . 
  the `` civilization '' that they are referring to is the west . 
  * liberal democracy : ignoring the non-citizen , enemy palestinians for a moment , israel is a deeply democratic country . 
  in its 64 years of history , it has never had a coup , and power has been passed peacefully from one government to another since independence . 
  israelis are justly proud of their courts , which are internationally acknowledged as being of particularly high quality ( the canadian supreme court , iirc , referenced a decision by the israeli supreme court in one of its own decisions ) . 
  while there is discrimination against the arab minority -- which makes up almost 20 % of the israeli population -- israeli arabs are afforded the same rights as jewish israelis , and the jewish population has a remarkable amount of patience with israeli-arab politicians , who flirt scandalously with enemy groups like hezbollah or hamas . 
   ... or another shitty american jew war ... 
  uh , * excuse me * ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  does n't it ? 
  bureaucracies are amazingly good at arrogating power to themselves by drawing up `` standards '' that restrict lawmakers . 
   the eu has no mechanisms to destroy or remove the member states . 
  this is no real comfort to anyone : you do n't need to destroy or remove a level of government to make it irrelevant , just move the responsibilities of that government to the level below or the level above . 
  for example , in the commonwealth of massachusetts , we have abolished 8 out of 14 county governments . 
  we have counties , but all the responsibilities that county governments do in other states are performed in the commonwealth by either towns/cities or by the state government . 
  `` jew '' comes , ultimately , from the hebrew * yehudah * , which is both the name `` judah '' ( which was hellenized as `` judas '' ) and for the region of `` jud\u00e6a . '', 
   ( note that this is not really a critique - seeing as britain still is where it is , who knows if their way of running things is n't better than straight meritocracy ... 
  i mean , even the americans with all their self-made-man loud-mouthing have those skull & bones type organisations for future leaders and opinion-makers ) i think a lot of people -- americans included -- forget just how much american culture is influenced by british culture . 
  not only were the founding european populations british , meaning that every successive wave of immigrants have assimilated into a preexisting british culture , but our elites for pretty much the entire life of the republic have looked up to british norms for inspirations . 
  israel is a small country ; do major newspapers in austria has reporters in damascus , beirut , amman , * and * jerusalem ? 
  it 's not worth having a dedicated journalist just in austria . 
  i 'm just saying that it made more sense for crimea to be attached to the russian sfsr than for kaliningrad . 
  uh , the arab town of jaffa still exists . 
  it is completely surrounded by the jewish city of tel aviv , which was literally founded on empty sand dunes . 
  the arabs have a case for lod ( lydda ) or ashdod ( asdud ) , but the arabs were not expelled from jaffa . 
  they were simply outnumbered by jewish immigrants in the neighboring city . 
   i like germany so much that i 'm happy there are two of them . 
  the crimea borders the russian sfsr over the strait of kerch , though . 
  kaliningrad was separated from the rest of the russian sfsr , of which it was a part , by the lithuanian and belarusians ssrs . 
  we could not possibly raise the ante for russia any higher than it already is for russia . 
  for russia , ukraine * is * russia . 
  losing ukraine to the west is losing an essential part of russian identity , to say nothing of the fact that it pushes the russian border to the don . 
  putin and the russian establishment already sees the fight for ukraine as existential . 
  the us chiming in could not make russia any more frantic than they already are . 
  what 's the difference , though ? 
  irish-americans are ethnically irish the same way irish-irish or northern irish people are . 
  well , that 's kind of a dick way to put it . 
  sorry we care about our heritage ? 
  well , given that they are ethnically germans , i do n't see why calling themselves `` germans '' is improper . 
  if germans move to america and have babies with other germans who moved to america , the babies are still ethnically german , no matter how many generations removed they are from living in germany . 
  also , why would americans refer to themselves as `` anything - * american * '' amongst ourselves ? 
  we do n't need to remind everyone we 're american , because we 're all american here . 
  it 's just extraneous information , so when an american says he is `` irish '' or `` german , '' that is obviously interpreted by other americans as meaning that he is american of irish or german descent . 
  if you moved to germany or whatever for economic reasons , would n't you want your great-grandkids to remember you came from ireland ? 
  that seriously looks like a picture of a model tallinn square , not of the real thing . 
  that 's a real picture ? 
  not to mention that awkwardness with algeria . 
  oh , well , yeah , that was deliberate .
