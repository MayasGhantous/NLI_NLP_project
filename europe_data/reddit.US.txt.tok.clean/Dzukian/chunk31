  well , we guess we did n't think giving a city and a state the same name when they 're 3000 miles apart would confuse anyone ? 
  new york is both a city and a state , and the city is actually * in * the state , but it is * not * the state capital , so you ca n't use it as a metonym * . 
  * a metonym is using something associated with something larger to refer to the larger thing . 
  for example , using `` boston '' to refer to the massachusetts state government , or `` westminster '' to refer to the uk parliament . 
  i am so disappointed in you . 
  :( i hope it was stupid flyover states you screwed up , and not important ones like massachusetts or california or virginia . 
  well , it is my own country . 
  of course i would know the geography of my home . 
  ( and i did a lot of sporcle in college ... ) and chicago is probably our third-largest city , so i guess it 's a pretty easy mistake to make ? 
  it would give you ruhr if you guessed any city within the ruhr region ; for instance , for me it lit up with i guessed `` essen . '', 
  i consider that a solid showing . 
  aside from peterburg and moscow , i would n't have known any of the russian ones to save my life . 
  it would n't take `` upper silesia '' or `` silesia . '', 
  * grumble grumble grubmle *, 
  as a baseline , i , as an american , got 100 % in 1:14.1 . 
  i 'm on a laptop using a trackpad , so i blame that for being slow . 
  out of 50 total states , you guessed 13 states . 
  8 were correct : washington , california , alaska , hawaii , arizona , texas , florida , and maine . 
  4 guessed states were mislabeled : `` wisconsin '' is in fact montana , `` s. carolina '' is actually north carolina , `` n. carolina '' is virginia , and `` newyork '' is new jersey . 
  `` chicago '' is not , in fact , a state : it is a city in the state of illinois . 
  8/50 correct , so your score : 16 % . 
  edit : also , this quiz apparently includes 5 incorporated territories , so your score is 8/55 , so actually 14.5 % . 
  xerxes invaded the balkan peninsula , on which were situated a number of greek-culture city-states . 
  there was as much a `` greece '' during the persian invasions as there was a `` germany '' in antiquity . 
  i was talking about * states * , not cultures . 
  the modern state of greece did pretty much pop out of nowhere , in terms of the institutions that form the greek government . 
  the institutions that form the core of the greek states were created in the early 1800s when the state became independent . 
  i 'm well aware of that , but because of common usage , it would not be incorrect to use `` great britain '' to refer to the uk . 
  greece as a country only dates to the early 1800s , when it became independent of the ottomans in the greek war of independence . 
  washington , dc is n't a state ... 
  it 's a city . 
  in the district of columbia . 
  hence , dc . 
  ( amusingly enough , there is a [ columbia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/columbia_county,_washington ) in washington , too . ), 
  in germany , on the other hand , saxony , saxony-anhalt , and lower saxony are all full-fledged bundesl\u00e4nder . 
  i was just guessing based on what states exist at the beginning of victoria ii , but okay . 
  `` united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland '' is the official name of the country , and both `` uk '' and `` gb '' are common acronyms for the state , so either great britain or united kingdom would be correct . 
  i can never remember the bundesl\u00e4nder because you fools managed to name 3 separate states some variation of `` sachsen . '', 
  what the hell , guys . 
  there 's got ta be some other state in the northwest ) and i have no idea what the last one could be . 
  the old principality of moldavia , and the geographic region of moldavia , is still called moldavia in english , but the modern country of moldova is moldova . 
  you did okay , but you struggled with the balkans and islands . 
  let 's go from the top left and work to the right . 
  * `` i think these belong to either norway or denmark '' are the faroes ( to the west , owned by denmark ) and the shetland islands ( to the east , owned by the uk ) . 
  * `` whoever got there first i guess '' ( in the southern baltic ) are r\u00fcgen ( to the west , owned by germany ) and bornholm ( to the east , owned by denmark ) . 
  * `` probably all part of something scandinavian '' is close . 
  the top left island is \u00c5land ( autonomous part of finland ) , the islands to the right are saaremaa and hiiumaa ( estonia ) , and the island to the bottom left is gotland ( sweden ) . 
  * `` i think it 's romania '' is belarus . 
  you can remember because bela ** rus ** is next to ** rus ** sia . 
  * `` this might be slovenia '' is actually moldova . 
  * `` bulgaria ? 
  or is this one romania ? '', 
  is , in fact , romania . 
  * `` bosnia is still left so i think this is it '' is bulgaria . 
  you got the first letter right !, 
  * `` do n't recall this ever being there '' is bosnia ( and herzegovina ) . 
  * `` kosovo and montenegro '' is right : montenegro is to the west and kosovo is to the east . 
  ( south of `` i 'm gon na say serbia , '' which is serbia ) is macedonia . 
  ( northwest of croatia ) is slovenia . 
  * `` monaco is here somewhere . '', 
  is accurate , but san marino is not really around there : it is near the northeastern coast of italy . 
  * `` malta '' is not malta : that is the island of crete , which is part of greece . 
  malta is not shown on this map , but it 's a tiny island south of where the bottom point of sicily ( i.e. 
  `` even more italy '' ) points . 
  * `` is this still europe ? 
  probably china '' is kazakhstan . 
   it is a huge stretch . 
  european states have long history . 
  most have been great powers and many wars have been fought between them . 
  oh really ? 
  the states of ireland , belgium , estonia , latvia , finland , belarus , ukraine , moldova , germany , italy , slovenia , slovakia , romania , and greece are all younger than the united states . 
  the peoples of europe might have a lot of interesting history , but many of the * states * are not as old as y' all like to believe . 
   american states does n't matter when it comes to history , there is no need to learn them and you never `` pick it up '' in your studies . 
  this , however , is true . 
  new * worcestershire * ?!, 
  also , you named half the great lakes as states ? 
  it definitely looks like limburg was lumped into germany on the map template , so wc_eend is n't talking about his own country . 
   maybe it 's still about the welfare of the child . 
  maybe we want to deter people from doing it but ca n't resort to taking children from their parents if they choose to leave . 
  and yet he was incredibly willing to take those children away from parents who just want to pass on their family 's traditions to their kids . 
   did he single out jews or do you just not have a fucking clue what that word means . 
  he did n't single out jews , which is why i said `` anti-clerical or ... '' in his case , he seems to just dislike religion . 
  some people really do hate jews , though , and they present themselves as anti-circumcision activists to express that antisemitism in a `` legitimate '' way . 
   holy shit did you ever open a sodding dictionary . 
  have you ? 
   `` totalitarian : '' of , relating to , being , or imposing a form of government in which the political authority exercises absolute and centralized control over all aspects of life , the individual is subordinated to the state , and opposing political and cultural expression is suppressed : `` a totalitarian regime crushes all autonomous institutions in its drive to seize the human soul '' ( arthur m. schlesinger , jr. ) quas4r suggested preventing parents from imparting any religion to their child until the child is old enough to decide for himself . 
  such a law could only be enforced by personal surveillance on a massive scale and government control of access to religious institutions . 
  such a law would forbid people from bringing their kids to church ; from reading the bible to their kids at bedtime , etc. . how do you think that would look ? 
  this could only be enforced by a totalitarian police state that controls every minute aspect of your life . 
   if i come to the us and explain how cutting of the left little toe is an aspect of my religion and that it should be allowed due to the little importance for stability and the like do you think there will be anyone around that takes that shit when i plan to do it on a kid ? 
  and how the fuck would part of people 's dick fit in their controlling the masses masterplan . 
  do you have thousands of years of history backing up that `` cutting off the left little toe '' plan ? 
  because if not , then you 're just making stuff up . 
  religious * tradition * is called * tradition * for a reason . 
  and this is n't really about the circumcision : it 's about arbitrary government control over people 's personal lives . 
  no law concerning parenting is so constraining as to do what quas4r is suggesting , which is essentially to prevent parents from imparting any religious tradition to a child until the child is old enough to decide for himself which religion to choose . 
  can you imagine if the law forbade you from bringing your child to church ? 
  or from reading your child bedtime bible stories ? 
  such a law could only be enforced through intense personal surveillance and regulation of religious institutions . 
  how is that * not * totalitarianism ?
