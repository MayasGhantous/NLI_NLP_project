  further , i would like to comment that i think france 's policy of * la\u00efcit\u00e9 * is absolutely bonkers , and is deeply oppressive to religious freedom . 
  if the french want * la\u00efcit\u00e9 * , that 's their mistake to make , but i think the policy of essentially forbidding religion in public is oppressive , and obviously so . 
  yeah , i pretty much apply the stated principle across the board . 
  well , that 's a bit much , but the lefties here do get a bit ridiculous sometimes . 
   as long as the kid is a minor and under the responsibility of the parents , they can go wherever they damn please if they like the culture better somewhere else . 
  that 's freedom for you . 
  if that 's your attitude , then i suggest you stop pretending that your anti-circumcision stance is about `` the welfare of the child '' and be honest about its anti-clerical or antisemitic origin . 
  for you , it seems more anti-clerical , but for others , it is clearly a symptom of antisemitism . 
   except in this case , we really are . 
  having your dick cut is a religious tradition . 
  religion should be a choice . 
  babies are n't responsible enough to make this choice , maybe they do n't want that . 
  only solution : put everything on hold until the kid is responsible enough to decide for himself . 
  that is naked totalitarianism . 
  preventing people from raising their children the way they choose is probably the biggest way to control people 's lives -- and more importantly for the totalitarians -- to control the next generation of people . 
  there are few more intimate ways for the government to intrude on people 's lives . 
  reddit is abysmal , but i ca n't subsist on buzzfeed and blogs alone . 
   really ? 
  i had no idea . 
  well , good riddance . 
  if they are ready to go sit on a powder keg like the middle east , just so they can continue their iron age practices , they do n't belong with us . 
  it does n't sound like you really give a shit about the welfare of the child if you 're equally satisfied with the child being taken out of france . 
   about them moving to the usa , i do n't know what you as an american think about this . 
  americans have a different take than us on religious rights . 
  personally i do n't think the american way is sound ; you have to cut the crazy early on , otherwise it becomes normal . 
  as an american , i believe in maximum personal freedom within the limits of societal integrity . 
  this includes giving parents as much responsibility for the upbringing of their child as possible . 
  if a parent wants to impart his or her religious traditions to his or her child , i can see no reason why the state should interfere . 
  to me , `` you have to cut the crazy early on '' is a gentle summary of the way totalitarians think . 
  every totalitarian thinks they 're acting in the best interest of the stupid lumpenproletariat who can not think or decide for themselves . 
  i absolutely reject that idea . 
   anyone who thinks otherwise is welcome to adapt or fuck off to a country more `` tolerant '' of the extremisms of religion . 
  and they will , which is why we have a jewish community the size of israel and the israelis have a french-jewish population that grows by the hour . 
  brit shalom has essentially no basis in jewish tradition or law ; it is accepted by a truly tiny percentage of the jewish community ; it ends a practice that almost all jews identify as being * essential * to being jewish . 
  there is basically no possibility of brit shalom gaining wide acceptance in jewish society , especially in the diaspora . 
  israeli jews do n't really have to try to be `` jewish , '' since they 're israeli and identify as jews , so they might be more relaxed about circumcision , but good luck convincing diaspora jews of the same . 
  indeed , an ex-cia former professor of mine told me that he has numerous stories of dgse agents shamelessly stealing things from american businessmen in europe and handing them over to french competitors . 
  as in , `` we walked into our hotel room and there were guys rooting through all our stuff '' unsubtle . 
   to me , it seems people who follow that motto are saying that being right-wing is comparable to being dead . 
  then clearly , you have n't tried very hard to understand the phrase . 
  it 's a pithy way of saying that communism is terrible by utilizing the rhetorical skill of hyperbole to say that communism is so bad , it would be better to be dead than to be a communist ( or to be subjected to communist rule ) . 
  and again , as i have said numerous times at this point , the * english * expression `` better dead than red , '' is not perceived by most to be a fascist propaganda motto . 
  `` lieber tot als rot '' might ring some fascist-bells to anglophones , but `` better red than dead '' does not , generally speaking . 
  it 's worth pointing out that , because the nazi mass-murder scheme targeted primarily jews and poles , the other eastern european peoples saw the nazis remove two national groups that were seen as enemies by other eastern european nationalists . 
  nobody really anywhere liked jews anyway , and poles were seen as threats by the lithuanians , belarusians , and ukrainians in particular , because poles had for so long dominated the elites of those countries that starting a `` non-polish '' intelligentsia and elite was seen as essential by lithuanian/ukrainian/belarusian nationalists . 
  lithuanian nationalists objected to russian political domination of lithuania , but they * feared * continued polish cultural domination of lithuania , and the nazis handed them freedom from the poles on a bloody silver platter . 
  one ca n't really blame the lithuanians ( and estonians , latvians , some ukrainians , etc. ), 
  for erring towards preferring the nazis to the soviets , given the way that nazi terror disproportionately targeted disliked local minorities and increased the power of local ethnic majorities , while soviet terror disproportionately targeted local ethnic minorities in favor of `` foreign '' russian minorities . 
  obviously , nobody likes the nazis , but it is not at all confusing why many eastern europeans would have such strongly negative feelings towards the soviets while retaining much weaker antipathy towards the nazis . 
  edit : also , the genuine regret and soul-searching done in germany after germany 's war crimes compares favorably to the utter lack of any kind of regret or apology from the russians for soviet domination . 
  that 's probably a big part of it too . 
  and again , the association in america is with american anti-communism and not with fascist anti-communism . 
  language is not rational , you can not control or attempt to rationalize what people associate with a given phrase . 
  people saying `` better red than dead '' are generally doing so because they associate the phrase with anti-communism of the western variety , not because they are deliberately agreeing with fascists . 
  `` better dead than red '' is , at least in america , associated with postwar mccarthyism than with fascism . 
  i never even knew it was attributed to goebbels before today . 
  with phrases like this , the perception of where it comes from ( in this case , it is perceived to be a cold war , mccarthyite saying , which it actually was , although it might have come from elsewhere first ) it oftentimes more important to how it is used than the actual origin of who first spoke the words . 
  the french know very well how to properly get rid of a monarchy , given that they 've gotten rid of the monarchy , what , four times ?

  i kid .

  i 'm dumb . 
  `` hundred '' is indeed * me'ah * , the plural of which is * me'ot * . 
  * elef * is hebrew for `` thousand . '', 
  it 's been a while since hebrew class . 
  mea culpa : you were right . 
  the hebrew word for `` hundred '' is * elef * . 
  but , i get your point . 
  your movies do tend to be more artsy and less ... 
  i do n't know , dramatic ? 
  to be fair , love actually is a * really * good movie . 
  as a holder of a baccalaureate in linguistics , i am profoundly aware of the dangers of antisemanticism . 
  antisemantics are only the most vocal of the bigots of our society . 
  apollinaris88 is german :  c'mon all little genocide never killed nobody . 
  thunder-road is israeli :  well this is awkward . 
  * ohhhh * , i understand what you were saying . 
  i 'm on board . 
  as an american , * i * would consider poland a relatively developed and civilized country . 
  do you know what africa , asia , and much of latin america are like ? 
  well , as in other matters of dispute between the english and german nations , we can always blame the french . 
  some people argue that it was the norman french influence on english during the late middle ages that simplified the case system in english . 
  ( others argue that it was because of the influence of bilingual brittonic-speakers , or because of a general trend in germanic speakers to reduce case systems in favor of regularized word order . ), 
   grzegrz\u00f3\u0142ka once you break it down into `` gzhek-gzhuw-ka '' it 's really not * that * hard to say . 
  it 's just really intimidating at first glance . 
  i do n't know why other english speakers get their panties in such a knot about cases . 
  the case system is not * that * extensive in german and even then , once you get a feel for it , it 's not that difficult to guess which case you 're going to use . 
  i think this is highly variable because of the different ethnic groupings in the us . 
  in new england , i do n't remember german being offered that often . 
  french , spanish , italian , and latin were the languages regularly offered in high schools , with german offered sometimes instead of italian . 
  around here , grandparents are generally nana and papa or grandma and grandpa ; i 've never heard anyone call their grandparents oma or opa . 
  i have heard m\u00e9m\u00e9 / m\u00e9m\u00e8re and p\u00e9p\u00e9 / p\u00e9p\u00e8re ( french ) , though , which is what my brother and i called our very french step-grandmother . 
  i think `` nana and papa '' is an irish/italian thing , because my very protestant grandfather decided when my brother and i were like 15 that he did n't want to be papa anymore , he wanted to be grandpa , because `` papa was too irish . '', 
  there are oktoberfest celebrations here and there in the heavily irish - and italian-catholic new england , too . 
  i know my work had one , and there have n't been that many germans around here since we stopped operation paperclip . 
  is this a thing ? 
  this is true of french words in english , which are all about government , military , and fancy food , but i did n't realize there was a similar phenomenon in spanish . 
   you know the main reason for israel getting a lot of slack for this is because there 's a huge cloud of irony floating around the deal . 
   a big part of the concept of israel is there finally existing this place where jews can live without prosecution and whatnot . 
  then it turns out they themselves start discriminating .
