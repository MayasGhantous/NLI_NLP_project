   pains of having thousands years worth of history ... 
  but some other country managed to fit in 200 years of history slavery and civil war . 
  we 've had no slavery longer than we had slavery and we only had 4 years of civil war in 237 years . 
   anyway , technical question , how do you imagine stopping settlement construction ? 
  by force or by voice ? 
  one wo n't work , other one would end in bloody mess . 
  honestly ? 
  i think that the only way to stop settlement construction is for the palestinians to give in and let the israelis have the major border settlements and all of jerusalem . 
  sign a treaty and the expansion beyond those areas will stop . 
  refuse , and israel will keep pushing into the west bank . 
   maybe israel-palestine conflict has such big coverage because europe wants to play ball and sing songs with israel . 
  i suppose israelis would n't be happy if their country and sphere of influence would be somewhere between congo and india heh ? 
  doubtful . 
  israel gets tons of new coverage because it is nominally a `` war zone , '' but it is a very comfortable place for journalists to live . 
  it 's much more dangerous in turkish kurdistan , but in jerusalem you can get first-world hotels at second-world prices with nice beaches and beautiful women all within an hour 's drive . 
  international journalists are just like everyone else : given the choice between the congo and a cushy jerusalem hotel , they 'll take the hotel every time . 
   you claimed that europeans pretended like israeli concessions were a long delayed obligation . 
  my point is , that they were long delayed obligations . 
  back in 1967 when israel took gaza , they declared them occupied territory and claimed they would relinquish them eventually . 
  this only happened in 2002 , 35 year later . 
   edit : besides , if releasing occupied land , which gaza was ( israel never denied this ) is a major concession , then the bar is not set really high . 
  nobody forced israel to withdraw from gaza or from parts of the west bank . 
  they took a huge risk in withdrawing , as evidenced by the rockets that have been falling on southern israel for years . 
  by withdrawing , israel willingly reduced its own security . 
  what 's more , in withdrawing , israel has given space for the palestinians in gaza to manage their own affairs . 
  how is giving the palestinians an opportunity for real self-government * not * a major concession ? 
  do you know what trivialities are fought over in this conflict ? 
  a minor concession would be israel closing a single checkpoint . 
  a major concession would be letting palestinians travel within area a without checkpoints . 
  withdrawing from the gaza strip and losing the ability to stop attacks on southern israel is a * huge * concession . 
  in international negotiations , even if somebody is `` legally '' obliged to do something , it 's still a concession when they actually do it . 
  something like the oslo accords is basically an agreement saying `` we will make this concession if you make that concession . '', 
  nitpick : it 's the `` queen mother , '' not the `` mother queen . '', 
  i agree , though . 
  the british touched the whole world . 
   a blockade is an act of war under il , so its `` actually '' worse than an occupation , according to the principle of proportion . 
  that 's irrelevant to what you were talking about . 
  you said that under `` international law , '' as if that were a thing with any kind of real coercive power , an occupying force is obligated to supply basic needs to an occupied population . 
  if , however , israel is not an occupying force , it has no such responsibility . 
  and again , i am ** american ** . 
  america is not occupying any of palestine 's borders , so the statement `` you are not occupying the border '' is actually true , if i am the `` you '' in that statement . 
   where in america are you from ? 
  are you jewish ? 
  observant ? 
  practicing ? 
  did you vote for mccain or obama ? 
  what do you do for a living ? 
  how much do you earn ? 
  i 'm an on-again , off-again episcopalian new englander who voted for obama in '08 and then for romney in ' 12 . 
  i 'm an entry-level white-collar professional . 
  anything else ? 
   you occupy the border crossing on the 4th side , the universities and school cant operate for a lack of basic supplies , as an occupying force you have to supply their needs under il ? 
  i and mine do n't occupy anything outside of afghanistan , since i 'm american , as indicated by my flair . 
  and israel actually no longer occupies the gaza-egyptian border , and has n't since israel unilaterally withdrew from the entire gaza strip in 2005 . 
  israel is actually no longer occupying gaza . 
  it is * blockading * gaza . 
  there is an obvious difference , in that occupying requires actual troops inside the territory that 's occupied . 
  the responsibility for the people in gaza lies with the palestinian authority . 
   your spouting propaganda and probably get paid to do so , or your a 3/10 troll . 
  i am neither spouting propaganda for money ( or for free ) nor trolling . 
  i 'm expressing an opinion based on years of following the israeli-palestinian conflict on my own and in an academic context . 
  that 's not a loophole , that 's called accuracy . 
  if you do something once , by accident , you would be rightly angry if someone accused you of having a `` proud history '' of making that mistake . 
   you are in / r/europe i was hoping for a specific country . 
  you lack flair . 
   i could refute every one of those points buy you are being willfully blind . 
  could you ? 
  because you 're not making a very strong effort to do so . 
  samis are like 1 % of the norwegian population . 
  hardly comparable to the palestinians , who almost equal the number of jews in the territory between the river and the sea . 
  well , you ca n't always get what you want . 
  we have tens of thousands of troops in bases all over europe at this very second . 
  i am legitimately sorry that we were unable to liberate you during wwii and the soviets got to you first . 
  technically , you have n't `` murdered civilian ** s ** '' until you 've killed more than one person . 
   lol , gaza is under a blockade . 
  its a large prison . 
  israel only borders gaza on 3 sides . 
  israel has no responsibility to only open passage through a border with an entity that has declared itself to be at war with israel . 
  gaza has a border with egypt . 
  if people think it 's a prison , then it is a prison created just as much by egypt as by israel . 
   there is no schools , or universities . 
  there are in fact [ at least 6 universities in gaza ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_palestinian_universities_and_colleges ) . 
   you cut off their power and water and then shell them with white phosphorus . 
  how many countries provide power and water to their sworn enemies ? 
   thats why we have take in thousands of refugees from gaza every year . 
  who are `` we '' here ? 
  because i am american , not israeli . 
  first of all , i 'm american . 
  i 'm not israeli . 
   they do for a few months and then start again . 
  israel promises and then starts the conflict right from the beginning taking more land and going back on their promises . 
  the international community understands this now , and acts accordingly , for you its not about peace its about land . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7dw89jictu[1] nobody forced the israelis to stop settlement construction . 
  stopping what is obviously in their interest ( or what they perceive to be their interest ) is a concession . 
  you fail to see this , which is * precisely the problem i 'm describing * . 
  europeans do n't see israeli concessions as concessions . 
   lol what ? 
  why ? 
  we have nothing to gain . 
  we want peace for peaces sake .
