  and israel 's rapid naturalization process for jews is because jews have historically been persecuted . 
  israel was founded so that jews would have the protection of a sovereign state . 
  if israel ca n't protect them from persecution where they live , it offers them citizenship so they can least be safe in israel . 
  i have no doubt that you 're honestly concerned about children 's welfare . 
  but i 'm telling you , that point of view is * not * how most jews see this measure * because * of two millennia of european antisemitism , including multiple instances of circumcision being used as a way to identify and punish jews . 
  from a jewish perspective , they will not willingly give up circumcision , so a ban on circumcision must be met with a jewish exodus from wherever bans it , since that country has essentially outlawed the raising of jewish sons . 
  all i 'm saying is , do n't act so surprised when jews get mad , considering what you propose is effectively an expulsion of jews . 
  my point was that nazis ' political opinions are n't protected under the law like social democrats ' in many european countries . 
  their political opinions are * exempted * from free speech laws . 
  why ? 
  because of * history * . 
  all i 'm saying is , jews could be granted an exemption from anti-circumcision laws because of their history . 
  and the history of anti-circumcision laws being used by european countries * to persecute jews just being jews * . 
  right , like how nazis enjoy the same freedom of speech as social democrats . 
  it would n't kill your country to make an exception for the few dozen jewish male babies born each year . 
  all that i 'm saying is that a little compassion would n't be amiss . 
  the comparison is not silly . 
  that 's exactly how many if not most jews see the issue . 
  would it kill european countries to make a small exception for perhaps a couple hundred births a year for a religious minority that they have spent the last two millennia persecuting ? 
  seriously . 
  would an exception to the rule really be so awful ? 
  but circumcision is not essential to the identity of muslims . 
  it * is * seen as essential to being jewish by jews . 
  to jews , banning circumcision might as well be making meeting in synagogues or jewish prayer illegal . 
  it 's like baptism illegal in poland . 
  that 's why it 's seen as a attack on jews specifically . 
  israel * is * a secular state . 
  it has no official religion . 
  but just a reminder : the united kingdom , which is indisputably `` the west '' has not just one but two state churches , the church of england and the scottish kirk . 
  secular jews practice circumcision too : it 's as much an ethnic/national practice as a religious rite . 
  it 's important to note that circumcision is not a tangential practice in judaism : it is seen as essential to being jewish . 
  israel is actively defending the practice of circumcision because the banning of circumcision is seen as an attack on the jewish people . 
  antisemitism has been a powerful force in europe for two thousand years . 
  suddenly people care so much about a handful of jewish babies ' foreskins that they want to ban a practice that jews believe is essential to making more jews ? 
  try and look at this from the jewish perspective . 
  europeans have been antisemitic for millennia . 
  they 're now trying to ban something that only really affects the tiny number of jews still left in their countries . 
  why * would n't * you assume their motivation was antisemitism ? 
  because sweden is n't renowned for having large italian ( or greek , who also make good pizza ) populations ? 
  how is this so hard to understand ? 
  america does n't have a lot of turks , so our d\u00f6ner kebab is few and far between and not great ; the same is true of sweden and italians . 
  i 'm sure there are n't as many as in new england . 
  because i 've eaten pizza in the czech republic and poland , and i ca n't imagine the pizza in sweden is much better . 
  well , i 'm sure your pizza places are as bad as our kebab places , so i think we 're even , really . 
  no matter how small the town is in new england , it * will * have 5 pizza places . 
  because we do n't have as many turkish or arab immigrants ? 
  that 's like asking why sweden does n't have as many italian restaurants as new england ( which is probably between 20-30 % italian ancestry ) . 
  anglicans have priests , and they are most certainly protestants . 
  well , it 's a hell of a lot better to root for the windsor-mountbattens than the kardashians . 
  doubtful , the overwhelming majority of americans love england . 
  the whole `` freedooooooom '' thing is a cheerful banter between friends , not a legitimate grievance against england . 
  essentially , there were at least 3 `` colored '' parts of an area called `` rus '' ( broadly speaking , the area controlled by the state of kievan rus ) in some proto-slavic language and `` ruthenia '' in latin : red ruthenia , black ruthenia , and white ruthenia . 
  red ruthenia is basically eastern galicia and volhynia . 
  black ruthenia is western belarus and northeastern poland , centered around novogrudak and grodno . 
  white ruthenia is eastern belarus , centered around polotsk and mogilev . 
  belarus , weissrussland , etc. 
  are all translations of white ruthenia . 
  as for * why * different regions in ruthenia have `` colored '' names , we 're not sure . 
  just pointing it out : it 's hard to make a case for shoveling more money towards veterans ' healthcare when we just had a massive scandal about the va hospitals being cesspits of corruption and providing shitty care to boot . 
  before the bureaucracy takes serious steps to reform itself , throwing more money at the problem is just a waste of money . 
  thanks for proving my point . 
  whether or not `` indian '' was an * accurate * description of native americans , it is now a grammatically correct way to describe them in english . 
  the word `` indian '' now means either `` from india '' or `` native american . '', 
  that 's what i mean . 
  well , when the grandfathers and grandmothers of today 's polish youth were in their heyday , jews made up 10 % of poland 's population and everyone knew at least one jew if not dozens . 
  the absence of jews in poland is a pretty recent phenomenon , and antisemitism has a shocking staying power even after a place no longer had jews living there . 
  your analogy is imprecise because people already use `` anti-european '' sometimes , so it 's around enough to have a conventional meaning . 
  `` antisemitism '' was coined essentially out of nothing , with its first usage in the context of `` prejudice against jews . '', 
  a more precise analogy would be if someone coined the term `` antieuropism , '' and used it to mean `` prejudice against germans . '', 
  in that case , if a bunch of people start using `` antieuropism '' to mean , `` prejudice against germans , '' then , well , that 's what the word means . 
  the word itself has no meaning : it has only the meaning attributed to it by native speakers of the language . 
  if all the speakers of the language who use `` antieuropism '' to mean `` prejudice against germans , '' then * that is what that word means * , regardless of what it * looks like it should mean * . 
  it 's not `` incorrect , '' just because it looks wrong . 
  words mean what they think we mean . 
  `` literally '' now means either in reality or figuratively , * because that 's how people use it * . 
  once a usage becomes conventional , it ca n't be `` wrong . '', 
  i 'm not talking about stormfront brigades . 
  i 'm talking about leftists , mostly . 
  i have seen a leftist pro-palestinian `` activist '' make the same `` judeo-bolshevists are destroying this country by hijacking the banking system '' argument and replace `` judeo-bolshevists '' with `` israelis '' or `` zionists . '', 
  no , that part of the wikipedia page does n't mean that the meaning has changed . 
  it means that the word antisemitism is conventionally used anachronistically to describe acts that fit the definition of antisemitism but occurred before the term antisemitism was coined . 
  that does n't mean the meaning has changed , it just means that its use is extended beyond its own lifetime and applied to acts before the term was coined . 
  have you never taken part in a discussion about israel ? 
  i 've seen straight-up nazi propaganda presented as `` legitimate criticism '' of israel . 
  this is completely false . 
  seriously . 
  open up the wikipedia article on antisemitism , and it will tell you that `` antisemitism '' was coined by a german antisemite to make hating jews sound more `` scientific . '', 
  insisting that antisemitism meant/should mean `` prejudice against semites '' is a textbook example of an etymological fallacy . 
  nope . 
  you are wrong . 
  `` antisemitism '' refers to prejudice against jews . 
  if you had bothered to click on link on that `` anti-judaism '' page to the page on antisemitism , you would see it clearly states :  antisemitism ( also spelled anti-semitism or anti-semitism ) is prejudice against , hatred of , or discrimination against jews as a national , ethnic , religious or racial group . 
  the difference between anti-judaism and antisemitism is largely academic , though . 
  for the layperson , almost all types of anti-jewish prejudice you will see in everyday life are expressions of antisemitism , not anti-judaism . 
  anyway , what you are doing regarding antisemitism is called committing an '' [ etymological fallacy ] ( en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/etymological_fallacy ) . '', 
  a word does not necessarily carry the meaning one would assume from the combination of its constituent morphemes . 
  `` antisemitism '' was coined to mean prejudice against jews , by a german antisemite who wanted to replace the german `` judenhass '' ( `` jew-hatred '' ) with a word that sounded more scientific , so he could justify his hatred of jews using the racial theories of the day . 
  using `` antisemitism '' to refer to prejudice against jews specifically is consistent with both it 's original usage and its conventional usage today . 
  and frankly , the only people i 've ever seen use `` antisemitism '' to refer to prejudice against `` semites '' are arabs or pro-palestinian folks who are specifically doing so to co-opt the word and prevent jews from using it , so you are in particularly poor company . 
  just to clarify : `` antisemitism '' refers to prejudice against * jews * , not prejudice against * semites * .
