  its how we really feel when we say you should treat the palestinians better . 
  there is no good or bad here , but israel could and should abide by the oslo accords and this conflict would have been settled 20 years ago . 
  you want peace ? 
  if you wanted * peace * , you would focus on objectively more bloody problems . 
  the war in the congo has cost * millions * of lives . 
  the turkish-kurdish war and the naxalite insurgency in india have cost tens of thousands . 
  the israeli-palestinian conflict is the most disproportionately covered conflict on earth , given its relatively low body count but the huge number of words devoted to it every news cycle . 
  and you think the `` conflict would have been settled 20 years ago '' ? 
  seriously ? 
  the oslo accords are a stopgap , halfway measure . 
  neither the israelis nor the palestinians saw oslo as anything other than a tool to get what they want . 
  the palestinians got enough authority that they can act like a government without the responsibility of being a sovereign state , answerable for their actions ; and the israelis got the ambiguity on borders that allows them to adjust the borders to fit the settlements and push the arabs a few km further away from the israeli heartland . 
   its 2013 , and europe has never been more tolerant to different races culture and religions , get with the times . 
  you 're right . 
  europe * has * never been more tolerant . 
  for most of recorded history , your conduct would make the congolese blush . 
  israel has pumped lots of money into palestine . 
  palestinians are far better off , in terms of literacy , per-capita gdp , and access to education than egyptians and syrians , the other resource-poor arab nations . 
  most palestinian universities were built under israeli rule . 
  something `` worked '' in chechnya ? 
  last time i checked , it 's ruled by a repressive dictator ( both on the state and the federal level ) and it 's a part of the simmering insurgency in the north caucasus . 
  its insurgency was crushed by brute military force . 
   yeah , no , but whatever you say . 
  you 've obviously never been to norway . 
  does russia not count as a threat ? 
  norway is more than 85 % ethnic norwegian , so `` ethnically homogeneous '' is not an unfair descriptor . 
  russia only sort of counts as a threat , since it is hundreds of miles away from major population centers * and * big brother us is obliged to defend norway in case it is attacked . 
  how far is russia from norwegian population centers ? 
  because you can see lebanon from israel 's third-biggest city and you can see the west bank from the suburbs of tel aviv . 
   patently false . 
  check un records for example , we talk with everyone including hamas . 
  we do n't pick sides , that 's why . 
  the un has a well-known anti-israeli bias . 
  not exactly the best argument here . 
   lots of promises , little actual movement . 
  see any two-state solution recently ? 
  this is * exactly * my point . 
  israel freezes settlement construction ? 
  `` well where 's the two-state solution ? '', 
  israel shuts down some checkpoints ? 
  `` i still do n't see a two-state solution . '', 
  nothing they do pleases you because the only thing you want from israel is capitulation . 
   yeah , no , europe is not a country either . 
  we vote 50 different ways . 
  anyway , israel and the us likes to point out that `` we '' are unfair . 
  a lot . 
  life is unfair . 
  then you clapped and cheered in 50 different ways . 
  i know that life is unfair , which is my standard response to whiny europeans who resent my country 's power and influence in the world . 
  why it is upsetting when * you * act so obviously unfairly to different sets of countries is because you claim to be impartial moral observers . 
  what ? 
  israel takes part in most things european that is important ; trade agreements with the eu , education cooperation and freedom of travel . 
  and yet , organizations like medicins sans fronti\u00e8res shun israelis . 
  being israeli is enough to merit insult and disdain in `` polite '' international circles . 
  europeans invite israelis and moroccans to counterintelligence seminars to patronizingly teach them how to `` respect human rights in counterterrorism , '' while israel and morocco should be the ones teaching the europeans ( uk excluded ) how to do counterterrorism effectively . 
   what major concessions did israel make to the palestinians anyway , besides dismantling the settlements in gaza after having long delayed this obligation ? 
  are you * trying * to be ironic ? 
  norway is vilified in israeli media because you 're a completely homogeneous country with no real enemies and money that bubbles out of the ground that thinks its shit does n't stink . 
  nothing grates on the israelis like european pretensions to moral superiority . 
  it 's nothing about norwegians specifically ; it 's just that you 're the exemplar of homogeneous , arrogant , wealthy westerners who level criticisms against israel without corresponding criticisms against israel 's arab neighbors . 
  when israel makes a concession to the palestinians , europe is unimpressed ; when bashar al-assad merely seemed like he would be a slightly less tyrannical dictator than his father ( who killed as many people in 3 weeks in hama as the entire israeli-palestinian conflict ) , europe clapped and cheered for syria 's `` reformist '' new president . 
  that 's what israelis resent . 
  every major concession by them is treated as a long-delayed obligation , while every minor reform ( or even prospect of reform ) by the arabs is applauded like they just invented the magna carta . 
  israelis are seen as `` european '' enough by europeans to hold to `` european '' standards of human rights , but not `` european '' enough to be accepted cordially in european organizations . 
  british-americans underreport their presence since being a wasp is sort of the default , so if people have other ancestry , they generally claim that nationality . 
  i 'm gay and i agree . 
  also , it shames the rest of gay men if homophobes are not just assholes , but assholes * because they 're secret gays * . 
  to be fair , some irish accents ( especially dublin ones ) * do * sound remarkably similar to estuary english accents . 
  it 's not like you lot are that great at telling midwesterners from northern new englanders , anyway . 
   arabic not fair !, 
  the maltese have an advantage !, 
  `` oven '' is a colloquial term for `` furnace '' ( or `` crematorium , '' or `` toaster , '' really any appliance that burns things inside it ) in english . 
  are you in the midwest ? 
  the midwest , after being initially settled by english new englanders , was settled by huge numbers of germans . 
  most people in the midwest really are german . 
  in new england , there are many fewer germans . 
  everyone claims either irish or italian ancestry . 
  i use , `` if you could , would you please ... '', 
   maybe it 's just due to that certain nation with a massive persecution complex . 
  i highly doubt it 's * ireland 's * fault . 
  did you know that there are more yiddish-speaking jews in [ one village in the us ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiryas_joel,_new_york ) than in all of sweden ? 
  thessaloniki had a population of more than 100,000 and it was , in fact , [ majority jewish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thessaloniki#the_jews_of_thessaloniki ) during the last years of the ottoman empire . 
  and lebanon !, 
  iirc , it was on the the news when our former president 's daughter ( chelsea clinton ) got married . 
  they do n't `` mean caesar '' in the same way that the english word `` caesar '' does n't `` mean caesar . '', 
  kaiser and tsar are just `` caesar , '' subjected to the same ravages of linguistic change that turned / kajsar / into / sizer / ( rough transcriptions ) in english . 
  1 in 3 young germans want to bring back the hohenzollerns ? 
  where did you read this ? 
  and why ? 
  i have no problem with constitutional monarchies , but i ca n't think of any examples of a people inviting the monarchs back after 100 years of being a republic . 
  sorry that we 've never been ruled by a brutal dictatorship to teach us a lesson about snitching ? 
  also , as an american whose family members have committed crimes and * not * been turned in the rest of their family , i take offense at your obviously misinformed generalization . 
  it 's mentioned on us driving licenses , too . 
  [ it 's obvious . 
  it might have been tongue in cheek , but it 's only a half-joke that reflects what looks like an increasingly popular conception of the whole ordeal . 
  wow , talk about a terribly misinformed view of the american mindset . 
  americans generally agree that redistribution for the sake of redistribution is wrong , not because god ordained it that way or because rich people made better choices , but because everyone 's property is their own and not the property of the government or of society , and if you 're going to take someone 's property , regardless of how much money they have , it better be for a damn good reason . 
  moreover , the assumption is not that `` rich people are rich and that 's totally fair and just , '' the assumption is that `` the world is n't fair , '' and there 's no point in either moaning about it or having the government take money because it has decided that people making more than one arbitrary amount should give their money to people making less than some smaller but equally arbitrary amount . 
  it 's not the government 's place to make life fair . 
  it 's the government 's place to provide for the common defense and to ensure that everyone is equal * under the law * .
