  a rich man and a poor man ought to be equal in the eyes of the law ; we do not have to make the rich man poorer or the poor man rich to offer them equal protection . 
  remember that unlike basically every single european state , america is not a nation-state . 
  its political legitimacy does not derive from its position as the sovereign representative of an ethno-cultural nation ; its political legitimacy derives from the principles based on which englishmen in america revolted against the english government in england . 
  ireland revolted from the uk because the rights of the irish as a nation were seen to be oppressed ; the colonies revolted from england because the rights of * individuals * were seen to be oppressed . 
  the way in which americans see the world is , because of our history , individualistic . 
  because of their own history of uniting into nation-states , europeans tend to see the world in communitarian terms . 
  it 's just a different way of thinking about how society ought to be organized . 
  what ? 
  good grief , how you get * that * out of my comment ? 
  op said that there was a web of treaties that would invariably be invoked to pull the uk into war . 
  you said that the web of treaties was imaginary ( which it is ) , but i assumed that the implication of your comment was that the uk would not be pulled into the war by treaties . 
  i pointed out the nat would legally oblige the uk to defend turkey if that country were attacked , because that validated op 's original comment about the uk being vulnerable to being pulled into the war by treaty obligations . 
  if there is a chemical attack against turkey , we ( the rest of nato ) should and * must * respond militarily , since otherwise the alliance is worthless . 
  i agree , but there is * one * treaty that would have the effect of the `` web of treaties '' that op mentioned . 
  i do n't know why you all seem to believe that america 's been pressuring the uk to act in syria . 
  our fearless leader has no intention to do anything about syria and is only talking about a token strike because he fucked up and said that using chemical weapons was a `` red line , '' so his credibility ( already virtually nonexistent ) would not be ruined if he did nothing . 
  we 're not exactly beating the war drums over here . 
  the north atlantic treaty would oblige the uk ( as well as the rest of nato ) to defend turkey if turkey were attacked and if turkey invoked article v of that treaty . 
  well , of course you do n't think they sound alike , because you 're familiar with both of them . 
  there are relatively few russians and portuguese/brazilians in america ; most american schools do not offer either language ( french , spanish , german , and latin are preferred ) . 
  most americans have had very little if any exposure to either language , because there is no need to be exposed to either . 
   i do n't think his record on stoking the military when it 's not our place ( imho ) , dealing with the financial sector , the nsa , and copyright and patent reform does much to convince me he 's pulling the country in the right direction . 
  on all these things we probably agree , but we probably disagree on what he * should * be doing . 
  there were small things within the aca that were good , but the fact that the government is fleeing full-tilt from the legally-prescribed deadlines in the aca is * not * a good sign . 
  he 's not a conservative . 
  he may do some things that some conservatives would agree with ( like he does other things that some liberals would agree with ) , but i do n't think that he 's a conservative , intellectually or philosophically speaking . 
  if he 's acting `` conservative , '' it 's not because his conservative principles are in error , it 's because he 's a liberal trying to ape conservatism to placate an american public that does n't agree with him on major issues . 
  as an american who actually thought my portuguese coworkers was russian until i figured out how to parse what she was saying ( and then it was obviously a romance language ) , i think the fact that portuguese has a lot of `` sh '' and `` zh '' sounds in it makes people think of russian . 
  chinese and japanese sound nothing like norwegian , though . 
  he 's not acting like a conservative : he 's acting like an incompetent . 
  his foreign policy decisions have almost unanimously been awful . 
  the jewel in the crown of his domestic policy ( the aca ) is such a wreck , he 's actually refusing to enforce it when he needs to . 
  his ideas * and * his execution are bad , in every field . 
  linguists would represent the phoneme used by speakers of [ rioplatense ( argentinian/uruguayan ) spanish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rioplatense_spanish#phonology ) as [ / \u0292 / ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiced_postalveolar_fricative ) ( as in `` mea ** s ** ure '' ) or [ / \u0283 / ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiceless_postalveolar_fricative ) ( as in '' ** sh ** ake '' ) ; the latter is more common in buenos aires , and the former more common outside the city . 
  in contrast , the sound that peninsular spanish speakers use for `` ll '' could be represented with [ / \u029d / ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiced_palatal_fricative ) . 
   like mother . 
  why is n't it spelled madur . 
  because there 's a distinct [ `` th '' sound ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voiced_dental_fricative ) , and not a `` d '' there ? 
  this map represents linguistic * descent * . 
  in the first few generations of dutch settlement on the cape , dutch was the language spoken by the `` dutch '' settlers there . 
  but as centuries passed , linguistic changes took place , and the language spoken by `` dutch '' afrikaaners could be considered a language distinct from dutch as spoken in the netherlands . 
  what separates afrikaans from dutch are linguistic changes , both in africa and in europe , that make afrikaans sufficiently distinct for linguistics to consider them separate languages . 
  by contrast , the distinction between dutch and flemish is political , not linguistic . 
  `` flemish '' is , by definition , the variety of dutch spoken in flanders . 
  however , it seems that what this map has done is to simply assume that `` flemish '' is a language distinct from dutch , though the map gives no clue as to what that assumption is based on . 
  if you assume that flemish is not dutch , you could also assume that both dutch and flemish are the daughter languages of middle dutch : that from a population that spoke middle dutch , two distinct linguistic groups emerged , a dutch-speaking one and a flemish-speaking one . 
  i think the map erred on this one . 
  i would not have included flemish at all , since `` flemish '' could refer to any one of the dutch dialects that are spoken in flanders , some of which are also spoken in substantial parts of the netherlands as well ( brabantian and limburgish in particular ) . 
  i 'm not an expert on dutch , but iirc there is not enough linguistic evidence to support a claim to a flemish language distinct from dutch and common across the dutch dialectal zones in flanders . 
  edit : `` linguistic evidence , '' not `` linguistic enough . '', 
  as a new england conservative , nothing has brought me more schadenfreude than the number of democrats grumbling about obama . 
  it 's * delicious * . 
  ireland has neither the will nor the capability to be of any use to the us other than as a tax haven . 
  the uk , by virtue of the size of its population , economy , and military , and its people 's historically demonstrated will to partake in distant military adventures , eclipses ireland so completely in importance to us foreign policy that i do n't imagine us policymakers give ireland 's position a second thought . 
  the only time ireland gets news in the us is when irish lawmakers representing the majority-irish-american districts in new england make a stink about us being nice to the uk . 
  mashed earth apples and gravy ? 
  israel has n't done anything about syria and the west is clamoring to be `` dragged in . '', 
  do n't lay blame for this on israel . 
  so our spies are better-equipped than everyone else 's . 
  i 'm sure the swiss have the geneva hq surveilled as well . 
  everyone * did * already know that * everyone * spies on the un . 
  that is certainly true . 
  technically , the uk is just one single kingdom , since the kingdoms of england and scotland were legally dissolved with the passage of the [ acts of union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acts_of_union_1707 ) and merged into a single kingdom , the kingdom of great britain , which was itself ( along with the kingdom of ireland ) dissolved in 1801 with some more [ acts of union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acts_of_union_1800 ) and both the kingdom of great britain and the kingdom of ireland were merged into the united kingdom of great britain and ireland . 
  the legal status of that kingdom has n't changed : just the territory it controls ( i.e. 
  no longer southern ireland ) and the name . 
  i did not say i thought it was the word of jesus ; i said i thought jesus would approve . 
  my parents imparted to me the value of hard work and the idea that god would not just stretch out his arm and give me what i want . 
  i do not think that jesus would disapprove of that . 
  given that this is what i was raised to believe , yes , yes i do think jesus would approve . 
  massachusetts , vermont , and new york ( i ca n't speak for ca ) are more like france , actually . 
  the large urban centers lean left , but the * campagne * is a bunch of rural farmers and labourers who lean slightly but firmly to the right . 
  edit : and obviously , the suburbs -- which account for a large proportion of massachusetts ' population -- are split between do-gooder bourgeois liberals and fiscal conservatives . 
  vermont does n't have a coast . 
  [ the greater good ] ( http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/for_the_greater_good ) ? 
  the us is older than both the french republic and germany . 
  it 's been democratic for far longer than spain , and the uk 's democracy was sketchy at best until the 1830s . 
  as a representative democracy , the us is older than virtually every state in europe . 
  `` god helps those who help themselves '' was the refrain of my american childhood . 
  my parents were not particularly religious , but it was alway taught that prayer and piety would accomplish nothing without action . 
  god gives you the strength of will to accomplish what you want ; he does not hand it to you on a silver platter . 
  lutherans and calvinists are both subsections of `` protestants , '' which is an umbrella term for christian churches that are neither catholic nor orthodox . 
  lutherans tend to be more theologically conservative ( i.e. 
  similar to catholicism ) , especially in retaining institutions like the episcopacy , while calvinists are more theologically radical , focused on dynamic preachers and whatnot . 
  i know that map very well , having played many , many hours of victoria 2 . 
  in light of the map , the `` prussian '' jokes make sense to me now . 
  do germans still make `` prussian '' jokes , even after prussia was depopulated of germans ? 
  the language log has a [ pretty good rebuttal ] ( http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4351 ) of that norseman 's claim about english being a scandinavian language . 
   why then do you deport some of those `` first-generation americans '' back to their home countries ? 
  because those particular people are * not * first-generation americans , but people who have illegally snuck into our country . 
  that may be how you see it , but in america , immigrants are `` first-generation * americans * . '', 
  at first glance , that seemed strange , but on second thought , it does make sense . 
  if the spanish speakers you see on a day-to-day basis are lower - or lower-middle class , there would definitely be a negative stereotype associated with speaking spanish . 
  one wonders if there 's a negative stereotype against french in urban louisiana , where french ( cajun ) speakers are less well-off than the richer anglophones . 
  i believe he was daring you to identify whether someone is a german or a pole ( or a jew ) if they 're speaking perfect czech to you . 
  well , to be fair , i * do * live in the northeast , in a very bourgeois suburb with few hispanics and no monolingual spanish speakers , to my knowledge . 
  it might be the case that teepr is an ethnic czech convert to judaism , but converts typically identify as jews and assimilate completely into the jewish people , so their own children would consider themselves jews , not czechs or czech-jews . 
  because converts assimilate so totally , we can treat jews as an ethnicity in addition to treating jews as a religion . 
  von neumann , szilard , and teller were all hungarian * jews * . 
  it is inaccurate and anachronistic to describe them unconditionally as `` hungarians , '' since they would not have been seen that way by hungarians of the time . 
  and of course , brahms ' incredible [ hungarian dance no .
