  if it makes you feel any better , england would be my first choice !, 
  as an american , i feel like my view of the world would mesh better with britons than with continentals , and i 'm a big believer in strengthening ties in the anglosphere . 
  i 'm an anglophile , though , so my viewpoint might be blurred . 
  i 'm american and have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  we rib the french about losing wwii and we really did not appreciate the french venom spat at us over iraq , but most americans like france . 
  france has comparable [ favorability ratings ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/1624/perceptions-foreign-countries.aspx ) among americans as israel and india ( about 7 out of 10 americans have a favorable opinion of it ) . 
  only true-blue friends like canada , the uk , germany , and japan are more highly approved-of by americans . 
  paris appears so often as an idyll in american media that it 's a [ trope ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/gayparee ) . 
  every teenage girl i 've ever known has at some point expressed a desire to go to paris . 
  in my high school , taking french was seen as a better choice than taking spanish ( which , remember , 10 + % of our country speaks natively ) because french culture is better and french is a language for `` educated '' people . 
  when my friend moved to france to be with her french boyfriend , most of us were bitching about how jealous we were , and nobody expressed any negativity towards france . 
  which americans have you been talking to ? 
  which linguists ? 
  english is a west germanic language , grouped most closely with scots ( anglic ) , then frisian ( anglo-frisian ) , then dutch , afrikaans , and yiddish ( west germanic ) . 
  that 's the conventional categorization of english . 
  there 's some scandinavian influence and vocabulary ( i.e. 
  the word `` they , '' iirc ) , but the underlying language is west germanic . 
  also , `` territorial integrity '' does n't mean what the spanish claim it does . 
  the principle of respecting territorial integrity favors * the uk * in the gibraltar dispute . 
  that 's not what territorial integrity means . 
  `` territorial integrity '' means respecting the sovereign territory of other states and not taking action to alter that territory ( by aiding secessionists , or recognizing territorial acquisitions by third parties ) . 
  no probs . 
  armenian is a seriously interesting language , and i wrote my last college paper on the nk/artsakh conflict , so armenia holds a place in my heart . 
  they did , in the [ treaty of sevres ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_s%c3%a8vres ) . 
  [ `` armenia '' as defined by woodrow wilson ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wilsonian_armenia ) was substantially larger than armenia today . 
  however , the turks were able to push the armenians back after the turkish nationalists rejected sevres and fought a [ war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_war_of_independence ) to change the status quo , after which the treaty of sevres was replaced by the [ treaty of lausanne ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_lausanne ) . 
  `` the universe '' did n't place mount ararat in turkey . 
  turkey placed it there , when it fought the armenians back to the current border during the turkish war of independence . 
  if the armenians had done better or the turks worse during the war , then mount ararat would be in armenia . 
  * descendant of , i think . 
  the world is not a uniform blob , but our moral standards do n't -- or * should n't * -- adjust themselves based on who we 're talking about . 
  if the middle east is not a bastion of egalitarianism -- and obviously it is not -- then it is up to us to voice our concerns to them . 
  saying , `` oh , they 'll never change '' is essentially telling arab gays or arab christians or arab liberal democrats that they 're not only fucked at home , but that we do n't care about them or their rights the same way we care about russians gays because they 're just * arabs * . 
  if you have a particular standard for human rights , why are n't you applying it equally to both russia and saudi arabia ? 
  why does russia get your care while the rest of the world gets written off ? 
  i 've been to the middle east and i found no reason why people there could not be held to the same standards that we hold ourselves to . 
  frankly , i think the position you 're advocating is a thinly-veiled rationalization for bigotry . 
  lebanese people or syrians or saudis are just as capable of maintaining the standards of civility that we expect from the french or dutch ( or israelis , whom europeans seem to have no problem condemning for not acting like europeans `` should '' act ) . 
  letting them off the hook just because `` oh , they 're arabs , they 're socially regressive '' is condemning the lot of them to the status of uncivilized barbarians . 
  we should be putting * more * effort into condemning their homophobic behavior if they 're `` socially regressive , '' not * less * , because being `` socially regressive '' * is itself the problem * . 
  that 's not the argument that people here are making . 
  people here are arguing that russian persecution of homosexuals is somehow * worse * than saudi arabia or iranian or ugandan persecution of the same , not because of the objective severity of the persecution , but because part of russia happens to be in europe and that is not true of saudi arabia or iran or uganda . 
  because russians are * europeans * , and * europeans * do n't persecute gays . 
  the corollary to this is that saudi arabians and iranians and ugandans belong to some other class of humans , one that simply * does * persecute gays . 
  they are not * expected * to be better than that . 
  the attitude on this subreddit , it seems , is that arabs and persians and africans can not be expected to behave civilly towards gays . 
  we do not expect civility from them because they are not civilized . 
  so , in other words , russians are civilized , so we can hold them to the same standards we hold ourselves , but the tanzanians and the muslims are not ? 
  we do not hold them to the same standards we hold ourselves ? 
  why not ? 
  what separates us from them ? 
  opposing homophobia is basic human civility . 
  actually , i believe gibraltar would be covered by the atlantic treaty , because it is the `` territory of any of the parties in europe . '', 
  in fact , i would be shocked if gibraltar were excluded , since maintaining control over the waterways between russia and the ocean ( the bosporus , the dardanelles , the suez canal , the straight of gibraltar , and the [ giuk gap ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giuk_gap ) ) was a major concern of nato . 
  the [ north atlantic treaty ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm ) requires mutual assurance in case of war only on a limited geographic area :  article 6  ( 1 ) for the purpose of article 5 , an armed attack on one or more of the parties is deemed to include an armed attack :  on the territory of any of the parties in europe or north america , on the algerian departments of france  ( 2 ) , on the territory of or on the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the parties in the north atlantic area north of the tropic of cancer ... edit : the falklands are south of the tropic of cancer , so they are excluded from the `` north atlantic area '' in which nato members are obligated to defend one another . 
  as a gay man who intends to use surrogacy as a method to have natural-born children with my own genes : ouch . 
  may i ask why , as a catalan , you are * not * particularly sympathetic to basque independence ? 
  from this side of the pond , i see basques and catalans ( and to a less prominent extent , galicians ) in pretty much the exact same situation . 
  just fyi , * guns , germs and steel * is not terribly well-regarded by serious historians . 
  ask / r/askhistorians about it . 
  mm , that 's true . 
  it was just jarring to see the street again . 
  i really liked krakow and hope to go back as soon as i can . 
  i 'm pretty sure i had lunch on that street when i was in krakow !, 
  what a coincidence . 
  oh , i like the houses !, 
  they 're adorable . 
  as an american , this was my assessment of prague , krakow , and budapest . 
  beautiful city centre , ugly-as-fuck soviet blocks all around . 
  huh , interesting . 
  what a cool way to mod that . 
  i do like how titles and regions change name when people of different culture groups control them . 
  lubice ( slavic pomeranian )  lybaek ( danish germanic ) , york ( anglo-saxon )  jorvik ( norwegian ) , etc. . 
  the prussians were done poorly , though : when they conquer lithuanian territory , the territory suddenly switches to polish/slavic names instead of baltic names . 
  iirc , the anglo-polish treaty that created the alliance had a secret protocol that specified that british assistance in war was guaranteed in case of attack by germany specifically . 
  the soviets were excluded from the treaty . 
  the uk was not legally obligated to wrest poland from the soviets , and in any case , it 's not very clear that the allies could have done so without bleeding themselves dry . 
  wow , that is excellent . 
  i wonder how those would be ported to euiv , though ? 
  oh , i * do * have the old gods enabled . 
  otherwise you ca n't play as the pagan lithuanians . 
  i do * hate * the name of the wendish empire though . 
  i do n't even want to form it because the name is just so bland and meaningless . 
  besides which , wends were slavs and lithuanians and prussians are * not * slavs . 
  i do n't use the og start date though because i hate `` oh , you 're at war ? 
  just kidding huge danish deathstacks are here to wreck your shit '' crap . 
  i was n't planning on reforming the romuva either : i was planning to convert my court to catholicism and then , in eu , convert the country to protestantism . 
  seems more fun that way . 
  oh lawd , you actually play sunset invasion ? 
  that 's just a step too far for me . 
  i 've only really played two long campaigns of ck2 : one where i ended up as emperor of scandinavia and britannia , and another , only about 50 years in , as king of lithuania . 
  i 'm kind of a noob . 
   it sounds really far fetched right now , but who knows what russia and europe will be like in a century or two , no ? 
  oh , i 'm much too much my father 's son -- my father is an implacable cold warrior -- to think that . 
  as an american of lithuanian descent and a polophile , i really , really do n't think that 's a good idea . 
  so psyched about eu4 . 
  i ca n't wait until my computer 's back and i get to boot it up . 
  too bad i lost my ck2 save when i formed the kingdom of lithuania . 
  i think the criticism about failing to reinstate the polish government-in-exile is legitimate , though based on unrealistic expectations .
