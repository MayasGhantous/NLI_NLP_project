  americans ca n't even begin to compete with the totality of horror conceived and perpetrated by europeans in the lifetime of my grandparents . 
  we 've already lost the `` worst shit ever done by humanity '' game , because you 've won so spectacularly that we just ca n't compete . 
  and yet , we 're supposed to treat * you * like the earth 's moral compass ? 
  thanks , but no thanks . 
  europeans can fuss about how they 're * soooo * over violence and war , but the stains of what they 've done , and the moral choices they 've made , can never be washed out . 
  if our dirty laundry is fair game for being aired , then the shit-stained laundry that europe tries to hide is fair game as well . 
  obviously all americans are responsible for what the nsa is doing , which is obviously worse than anything europeans have ever done ( like ethnic cleansing and genocide ) and today 's europeans are n't responsible for those horrible things anyway since collective responsibility does n't exist . 
  except for americans . 
  well , we did save south korea from being overrun by the norks . 
  it 's only because the chinese intervened that we did n't `` liberate '' all of korea . 
  and we tried to keep the roc alive . 
  not our fault the republican chinese could n't hold their shit together . 
  we 're also sorry we could n't liberate everything between the elbe and moscow after wwii , but we actually did n't want to bleed ourselves dry fighting the soviets back past the urals . 
  in retrospect , the soviets probably did n't have that much left in them , and might have lost if we had rolled through germany straight into poland , but that was a risk we could n't take . 
  i suspect it 'll be for another city in daenarys ' timeline . 
  does this make the uk , denmark , and sweden the elven ringbearers ? 
  bombing an embassy is a bit different than going to war with an entire country . 
  no shit , nobody ever invades another country without the expectation of some kind of material benefit . 
  nobody ever invades out of spite or boredom . 
  war has costs , and rational actors do n't go to war without the expectation of some reward that would at least partially offset the cost . 
  got any examples of when we did go bombing countries because they spy on us or do you just want to bandy about ludicrous accusations as if they do n't perpetuate dangerous and misinformed stereotypes ? 
  gitmo 's for suspected terrorists , not known spies . 
  known spies get ejected or put in real prison . 
  unless , of course , you could provide a single example of us bombing someone because of a spy ? 
  i 'll provide my own * whoosh * . 
  gen. keith alexander is a croat ? 
  normally when we find spies we just ask them to get the hell out of the country ( as with the russian spy ring uncovered not that long ago ) or we chuck them in jail ( as with cuban/israeli spies ) . 
  we do n't go bombing countries because they spy on us . 
  well , the thing about fashions is that we think they look nice now , but 20 , 50 , 100 years down the line , our descendants might think they look silly . 
  people really thought brutalist architecture looked good , in the past , but now most people think it 's just ugly masses of concrete . 
  i think neoclassical and other movements that deliberately mimic classics of architecture that we still consider to be beautiful on their own ( the parthenon , the colosseum , etc. ), 
  produce buildings whose aesthetic appeal is longer-lasting . 
  as an american , i do n't see the problem with neoclassical architecture . 
  our major government buildings are neoclassical , they 're from the 18th or 19th centuries , and most people here very much like the look of them . 
  `` modern '' - looking buildings tend to go out of style very quickly : case in point , boston 's hideously ugly brutalist city hall . 
  neoclassical buildings , on the other hand , age very well . 
  israel and cyprus have newly-found and quite substantial reserves of natural gas from eastern mediterranean basin . 
  i 'm sure the israelis and cypriots would be warm to the idea of a pipeline running north from the aegean or the adriatic to central and eastern europe . 
  that is , if europeans can see israel past their upturned noses . 
  to be fair , pinochet * did * provide the brits with intelligence during the falklands war , so it 's not like maggie just liked pinochet because she was into dictatorships . 
  my country is n't iraq : it 's the united states . 
  small countries also have small objectives in conflicts against big powers . 
  nobody thinks that a lithuanian victory involves a parade in red square . 
  the lithuanians just have to keep the russians out ( or mostly out ) and bleed them as much as possible . 
  it requires fewer resources to defend less territory . 
  with all due respect to russia ( which is in my case admittedly not a lot ) , russia is not the united states . 
  you do n't necessarily need to spend * more * : you need to have sufficient military resources to make a russian attack more costly to russia than russia is willing to pay , and your `` military resources '' includes those of your legally-bound allies . 
  lithuania has substantial resources from nato if it is ever attacked , but because the lithuanians would rather not allow russia to simply roll in and occupy the country before the nato forces arrive to liberate the country , it is in lithuania 's interests to have enough military force to delay if not resist the russian attack . 
  as for `` socially immoral : '' the cost of a military that can deter russian aggression is quite literally the cost of independence for any small state with a large , territorially-aggressive neighbor . 
  well , if georgia had had greater military resources , it would have been a more equal conventional war , which is why small countries on russia 's borders * like lithuania * would want to have substantial military resources of their own in addition to having alliances with militarily powerful countries . 
  well , all romance languages ( indeed , all indo-european languages ) are related to castilian . 
  it is true that catalan is more closely related to occitan , and galician more closely related to portuguese , but nonetheless both are still related to castilian , while basque is emphatically * not * . 
  only because the nazis invaded , and finland * did * lose its third biggest city ( viipuri ) , so it 's not like they really `` won , '' per se . 
  late edit : viipuri was in fact finland 's * second * - largest ( i.e. 
  most populous ) city . 
  a small population ? 
  britain is the 22nd most-populous country in the world . 
  the vast majority of countries on earth are less populous ( and significantly so ) than britain . 
  well , it was n't that long ago that russia and georgia fought a conventional war . 
  a fact made more obvious by the linguistic similarity between * croat * and * [ cravat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cravat ) * . 
  sami would indeed go under finno-ugric , if we 're basing this off of linguistic relation . 
  not sure if * ethnically * , the sami are closely related to the finns/estonians/magyars , but the sami language belongs to the uralic language family , just like finnish , estonian , and hungarian . 
  the only negative things i 've heard from americans about switzerland are lighthearted jokes about looted jewish gold and some moaning about the minaret ban from activist types . 
  well , i disagree . 
  i think they 're significant enough not to be dismissed . 
  the difference between local governance in new england and in the rest of the country is comparable to the difference between local governance in switzerland and in france . 
  the regional ethnic and religious disparities are obvious from the census maps . 
  i think that thinking in terms of `` states '' is counterproductive . 
  cultural regions in the us cross state lines all the time , and it 's better to think of the usa in terms of `` regions . '', 
  i did n't say that it did . 
  i was merely demonstrating that america * does * have significant regional cultural differences , based on the criteria that / u/granddeluge / listed . 
  as i 've said elsewhere , the tone of the article is heavily editorialized to imply that the us and germany might be coming to blows over this incident . 
  it 's really just a diplomatic spat and no responsible journalist would cover it the way the wsws did . 
  but nobody 's warmongering . 
  there has been zero indication by anyone in the us or german government that this could in any way provoke a physical confrontation . 
  but nobody 's warmongering . 
  there has been zero indication by anyone in the us or german government that this could in any way provoke a physical confrontation . 
  you ca n't just cut apart the article that way . 
  the editorial * tone * of the article blows the conflict massively out of proportion . 
  again , editorializing is not so much about the facts being discussed or what is said , but the way that it is discussed or the way it is said . 
  and as for the third point : no responsible journalist in a major newspaper would end an article about a diplomatic spat between major allies with hugely intertwined military institutions with that sentence . 
  i think you 're giving the wsws * way * too much leeway and ignoring the obviously editorialized tone of the article . 
  eh , i guess so . 
  i just sort of assumed that , given the irish government 's utterly irrational preference of the irish language over english ( irrational without a corresponding social movement to revive irish as the language of irish society , that is ) , it would have preferred the irish name . 
  i suppose i could see it your way though . 
  the facts of the article do n't seem to be wrong , but it 's editorialized to shit . 
  the last few paragraphs make it seem like it 's 1914 and we 're ratcheting up for war with the kaiser and that the us is doing everything it can to screw germany economically . 
  the `` pivot to asia '' was n't done to fuck over germany 's economic interests there , but because asia is increasingly the center of world industry . 
  only an idiot would claim that whatever tensions may currently be flaring up between the us and germany might result in military action , but lo and behold , that 's what the article is trying to imply . 
  no , but that 's why `` everyone hates [ us ] , '' should n't everyone hate everyone else too for the exact same reason ? 
  in which case , why do we so often get especially harsh opprobrium ? 
  i 'd just like to throw out that there are huge regional differences in the us for these categories . 
  * language : much of the southwest has huge spanish-speaking populations , including towns and counties that are majority-spanish-speaking . 
  there are pockets of majority-francophone areas in louisiana , vermont , new hampshire , and maine . 
  [ this map ] ( http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/pics/geo200/language/leading_non_eng_lang.gif ) of languages spoken at home other than english points out the strong presence of french in northern new england and louisiana and of german throughout the midwest . 
  * [ religion ] ( http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/geog1000/maplinks/religionmaps_files/churchbodies.gif ) : the northeast and the great lakes are solidly catholic ; the upper midwest is lutheran ; the lower midwest has tons of methodists ; the south is solidly baptist , except for the hispanic parts of texas and florida and french louisiana ; the great basin is overwhelmingly mormon ; and the west is mostly catholic . 
  * government type : this is n't as immediately obvious or as major as other regional differences . 
  the only salient difference is that while the rest of the united states operates under common law , louisiana operates under a [ civil code ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_louisiana ) . 
  another important regional difference is that , in new england , almost everywhere is included in an [ incorporated town ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_england_town ) , and each town is governed by [ town meeting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/town_meeting ) . 
  in much of the rest of the country , the powers of governance possessed by every tiny new england town are given only to cities , while [ county governments ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/county_ ( united_states \\ ) ) are more important in the midwest and have lots of power in the south .
