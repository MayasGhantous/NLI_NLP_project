  we were n't `` forced out '' of iraq : we left because indefinitely occupying a country whose demographic reality will ensure an ugly and essentially unending civil war is a waste of our resources . 
  we destroyed the iraqi army with a minimal number of casualties . 
  likewise with afghanistan ; our casualties have remained relatively low , but there is no political will either in this country or in afghanistan to root out the taliban and destroy them . 
  afghanistan simply is n't worth it , so we 're leaving . 
   and whilst you may have bases in 146 countries which means fuck all , we actually ruled over 1/5th of the worlds population . 
  the primary word there is `` rule * d * , '' as in the past tense . 
  no , the civil war was about slavery . 
  the `` states ' rights '' in questions were states ' rights to keep slavery.that 's not really in dispute . 
  i do agree with you , though : americans retain much of the english heritage the original settlers brought with them from england . 
  even after being demographically replaced by germans and irish and italians and chinese , the cultural patterns established by the englishmen who originally peopled british north america remain very influential in america . 
  i personally would prefer much closer ties within the anglosphere ; we are a distinct international unit with shared cultural , economic , and military interests . 
  um , just as an academic exercise : what did you want america to * do * about you being invaded by the soviets ? 
  america never recognized the annexation of the baltic states . 
  did you want us -- and the brits and french -- to push the soviets from berlin to moscow ourselves ? 
  how do you think that would have gone over at home ? 
  how many millions do you think would have died to liberate you ? 
  i 'm still undecided as to whether or not we * should * have ejected the soviets from eastern europe by force . 
  if i believed we could have done so with a minimal amount of bloodshed , i would have done so in a second . 
  but the soviets occupied everything east of the elbe and by the end of the war their army had all the momentum . 
  it would have required an even more massive war effort than already existed to tear you free from the soviets . 
  i 'm sorry that we could not have liberated you by war 's end , but i think the reality is that we really could not have . 
  i 'd like to point out that [ this study ] ( http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2008/08/who-serves-in-the-us-military-the-demographics-of-enlisted-troops-and-officers ) is more recent . 
  [ this image ] ( http://www.heritage.org/static/reportimages/045130a94ee437e6d7284160bbaa2862.gif ) in particular helpfully demonstrates that every income bracket from $ 40,000 - $ 45,000 and above is actually * overrepresented * in the military compared to their general share of the population , and [ this imag ] ( http://www.heritage.org/static/reportimages/360142b8859dd8eda9d80f008077f3b5.gif ) points out that the top three quintiles of neighborhood income levels of new enlisted recruits are overrepresented . 
  and this is data for * enlisted * soldiers . 
  the numbers for * officers * , who need to have a college diploma , are even more skewed upwards . 
  also , this sentence from [ the article you linked ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/03/ar2005110302528.html ) ? 
   many of today 's recruits are financially strapped , with nearly half coming from lower-middle-class to poor households , according to new pentagon data based on zip codes and census estimates of mean household income . 
  the implication of this sentence is that , if `` nearly half '' come from lower-middle-class to poor households , then * more than half * come from middle-class to rich households . 
   there would no longer be any motivation by al-qaeda to attack our country . 
  that is a completely ridiculous thing to say . 
  people like al-qaeda will continue to target the uk * no matter what the uk does * . 
  first of all , homegrown islamists born and raised in the uk can and will be seduced by rhetoric about the `` anti-islamic '' nature of the uk government because it allows gay marriage or because there 's a jew in the cabinet or whatever stupid reason the islamists will come up with . 
  second of all , al-qaeda-like islamists in the arab world think that britain ( and/or the us ) `` gave palestine to the jews , '' and nothing britain does now can correct that misconception . 
  they will never forgive or forget that . 
  third of all , in the interest of international relations , britain will continue to maintain friendly relations with the gulf arab states . 
  al-qaeda and other islamists hate the saudis ( and the other gulf states ) and consider them decadent and corrupt . 
  working british relations with the saudis and other gulf states , no matter how muted , will always continue to affront the islamists . 
  there is no foreign policy that britain can take whose result would be that `` there would no longer be any motivation by al-qaeda to attack [ britain ] . '', 
  none . 
  thinking as much is naive . 
  i think that you also fundamentally misunderstand the nature of intelligence sharing . 
  intelligence sharing * helps everyone * , that 's why countries do it . 
  for example , more open sharing from russia about the boston marathon bombing suspect might have prevented the bombing . 
  can you provide a source for your claim ? 
  the military in the usa is not a bunch of poor people . 
  the poorest people in the country often do n't meet the military 's entry requirements . 
  the middle class is well-represented both in the enlisted ranks and the officer corps . 
  my dad was solidly middle-class and joined the army ; in college i knew more than a few rotc ( officer trainees ) students who could clearly afford to go to an expensive private university , as well as some students who had been in the military beforehand who could afford the same . 
  there are large parts of this country where entering the military is a very desirable and respected profession , even among the middle and upper classes . 
  my dad went to a military academy with a bunch of snooty rich virginians . 
  i studied abroad with an rotc student who came from what is basically the southern aristocracy -- she was training to be a chaplain . 
  i 'm a native english speaker . 
  i dunno how i memorize genders ; i just memorize them at the same time as i remember the words . 
  tons of words fit into patterns , so once you remember the base gender , you 've got the rest . 
  to be honest , it 's been a while since i took german -- but i never found it that difficult when i was taking it . 
  the hard part was just memorizing vocabulary ( including gender ) , but that 's true of * any * language . 
  i suspect not : i just took german in college . 
  but when i was learning , that was not the hard part . 
  the hardest part was just learning vocabulary , which is hard in any language . 
  or in a question . 
  sorry , it 's been a while since german classes . 
  i started up hoi3 , watched all the tutorials , then started the game and realized that * none of the tutorials taught me anything * . 
  so i said `` fuck it '' and went back to vicky ii . 
  never looked back . 
   you accept having poverty levels higher than countries with half of your gpd per capita . 
  with the higher crime rates , lower social movility and the other problems that come with that . 
  why ? 
  just like what 's true of sweden is n't true of moldova , what 's true of massachusetts , minnesota , and utah ( low crime , high income ) is n't true of mississippi , arkansas , and west virginia ( high crime , low income ) . 
  i live in massachusetts and i do n't feel i have a low quality of life . 
  i never got the `` ugh german is * soooo hard * '' moaning . 
  there are only sixteen declension endings to remember for cases ( mas/fem/neu / plural x nom/acc/dat / gen ) , which always remain the same , and those are really only used for adjectives , pronouns , and adjectives attached to nouns . 
  word order , maybe ? 
  but once you learn `` the verb * always * goes second ( except in a subordinate clause ) , '' you 're pretty much covered . 
  technically today 's ukraine , belarus , * and * lithuania . 
  i 'm glad you enjoyed the article !, 
  i found it difficult to pick a single quote from the article as well . 
  i took a class on european security last year and it seemed like this article did a good job touching on all of the problem areas in european strategic thinking about defense today . 
  anyone who thought that the noble peace prize meant anything after it was given to * yasser arafat * was n't paying attention , in my opinion . 
  arafat was an unrepentantly murderous thug who terrorized jews and arabs alike . 
  maybe not in 1984/5 , but republics had already started declaring independence in 1990 . 
  plenty of people bitched and moaned when it happened . 
  i was an obama supporter at the time and even i thought it was stupid . 
  it 's certainly mutual within the anglosphere . 
  the us , uk , canada , australia , and new zealand have been cooperating in intelligence gathering for decades . 
  it is * highly likely * that european governments , as well as our other allies like south korea and japan , are doing just this . 
  the `` plan '' in reference was to reorganize the empire-kingdom as a federation of states , which would be divided as indicated on the map . 
  so instead of having the austro-hungarian empire , with an austrian/imperial/cisleithanian part and a hungarian/royal/transleithanian administration , it would have an austrian german administration , a west galician administration , an east galician administration , a hungarian administration , etc. . 
  the territory would 've remained the same but the administration would have been reformed . 
  americans do the same thing with the british royal family . 
  nobody cares that the swedish princess got married but will + kate news was in the tabloids over here for quite a while . 
  gay couples can have kids too : adoption and surrogacy are not exactly uncommon even among straight couples . 
   your arguiment was that poles did not kill jews out of antisemitism . 
  i prooved you wrong . 
  suddenly it does n't matter anymore . 
  i never said that poles never killed jews out of antisemitism . 
  i said that the poles never committed genocide , which is an organized attempt to eradicate a group . 
  isolated massacres are tragedies , but they are * not * genocide . 
  genocide requires the intent to exterminate and some degree of organization . 
   says an american who probably never set foot on eurpoean soil and likely got all his wisdom about the subject from history channel . 
  i 've been to europe -- auschwitz included -- and i love to read history .
