  it 's okay not to give a shit about the rest of the world , but if so , you have absolutely no reason or right to be mad , if people do n't know stuff like 9/11 or the oklahoma bombing . 
  uh , i * do n't * get mad if people do n't know about the oklahoma bombing . 
  why should danes care ? 
  9/11 is a bit of a different story because of its causal significance to the following decade , but i would n't expect europeans to know details . 
  most people everywhere do n't actually care about the rest of the world , and most people everywhere care less about events the farther away they occur . 
  well , nobody was * forced * to stay indoors . 
  the government put out * requests * that people stay inside and almost everyone did so . 
  my dad was one of a very small number of people who went to work anyway , but most people knew that the government would not ask people to stay inside if it was n't necessary and they kept off the streets . 
  as for the military presence being upsetting : the terrorist attack was * more * upsetting , i promise you . 
  also , need i remind you how badly the germans fucked up their response to the last time an international sporting event was attacked in [ their country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich_massacre ) , precisely * because * they lacked the appropriate military/security apparatus to respond to terrorism ? 
  well , yeah , but we 're almost entirely certain he did it , so the likelihood of that happening is really small . 
  if you murder your wife in front of me and i have pictures of you doing it , you 're still a `` suspect '' or an `` accused '' in the eyes of the government and media until you go to trial and the justice system confirms that you murdered your wife , at which point the government and media can say you were guilty . 
  everyone is presumed to be innocent until a court has determined him to be guilty . 
  american law operates under the assumption that you are innocent until * proven * guilty . 
  it 's worth pointing out that boston is a college town with hundreds of thousands of university students , all of whom were forced to stay indoors , worrying while a massive door-to-door manhunt took place all over the city . 
  the simultaneous relief of having caught the son of a bitch who attacked our city and of finally being able to go outside ( and let 's be honest , a lot of people probably spent most of the day drinking ) probably contributed to the size of the celebrations . 
  we spent all week mourning the dead and injured and worrying about the presence of the attackers and the possibility of continued attacks . 
  the sense of relief in boston is * palpable * , and there 's a lot of genuine respect for and happiness about the ability and success of our security services . 
  we may not be able to bring happiness to the families of the dead and injured , but we can give them justice . 
  uh , yes . 
  it was all over the news . 
  people who are in their early-to-mid 20s were pretty young when they happened , so they may not have been really paying attention at the time , and a lot of other important stuff has happened since , so it 's not like chechnya has dominated our headlines for the last ten years . 
  i personally have no memory of seeing the attacks on the news despite having very vivid memories of 9/11 , three years earlier . 
  i just was n't paying attention because some terrorist attack in a faraway , tiny province in russia -- a country i 've never had a great deal of love for anyway -- did n't hold my attention when i was 14 years old . 
  but my parents and older relatives do remember seeing the attacks on the news . 
  well , i studied terrorism in college , so i personally was well-acquainted with the chechens . 
  and my parents all remember the chechen terrorist attacks and correctly attributed them to the chechens . 
  it 's only people who were in their early teens or lower when these attacks happened who have only vague memories of them and do not associate the attacks with chechnya or chechens that are not familiar with chechnya . 
  the people who i 've seen screwing up chechnya/czechia are relatively young . 
  entire nations which have only the population of some american cities . 
  i 'm well aware of the distinctions between the czech lands . 
  calling the whole thing bohemia -- which has historically been the largest and most important of them -- just makes more sense than the whole thing moravia . 
  until we move past the `` haha europeans are soooooo liberal '' stereotypes and move into the `` europeans are extremely xenophobic '' stereotypes . 
  * then * we see who gets `` touchy . '', 
  uh , chechnya is even * less * important than an ex-ussr republic . 
  lithuania , latvia , estonia , etc. 
  are sovereign states , but chechnya is n't . 
  i do n't think it 's worthy of so much ridicule when americans are n't familiar with a tiny caucasian province of russia and , because they do n't recognize `` chechnya , '' they associate that name with the `` che - '' country they * do * recognize , the czech republic . 
  that 's totally understandable . 
  it 's just mildly hypocritical of europeans to get all huffy because many americans do n't know specifics of european geography when most europeans could n't identify more than a handful of american states . 
  if every state spoke a different language , nobody in europe would be able to keep them straight , so i do n't get why europeans get so uptight about a people on a different continent not knowing specific aspects of their geography . 
  how many europeans know that there are significant french-speaking communities in maine and louisiana ? 
  how many could name the states that have a shore on the great lakes ? 
  how many europeans know which states make up new england ? 
  how many europeans could tell new hampshire from new jersey ? 
  we have specific knowledge of * our * geography , and you have specific knowledge of * your * geography . 
  ca n't we just agree that everyone knows their own continent better than other people without implying those other people are stupid for not knowing it as well as they do ? 
  i did n't google that !, 
  my old job required me to mail stuff to canada and i memorized the postal abbreviations so i did n't have to look them up every time . 
  it 's not hard to remember 13 subdivisions . 
  there are ten provinces , from west to east : british columbia , alberta , saskatchewan , manitoba , ontario , quebec , new brunswick , prince edward island , nova scotia , newfoundland and labrador . 
  and three territories : yukon , northwest territories , and nunavut . 
  the capital of connecticut is hartford , which is the third most populous city after bridgeport and new haven . 
  little rock is both the capital and the most populous city in arkansas , though !, 
  arkansas , massachusetts , colorado ( denver ) , georgia ( atlanta ) , hawaii ( honolulu ) , mississippi ( jackson ) , oklahoma ( oklahoma city ) , rhode island ( providence ) , south carolina ( columbia ) , utah ( salt lake city ) , west virginia ( charleston ) , and wyoming ( cheyenne ) are the only states where that is the case , according to [ this site ] ( http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/a0763765.html ) . 
  actually , i 'm pretty sure that dot is pointing to [ this imposter ] ( https://maps.google.nl/maps?q=boston,+pa&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.229218,-80.244141&amp;spn=4.52902,9.876709&amp;sll=42.285437,-78.62915&amp;sspn=4.388777,9.876709&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=boston,+allegheny,+pennsylvania,+united+states&amp;z=7 ) , not boston , ny . 
  boston is the biggest city in massachusetts and the capital !, 
   how familiar are you with the geography of mecklenburg-vorpommern ? 
  mecklenburg-vorpommern is a german land in the northeast of germany , with a coast on the baltic sea . 
  notable cities include rostock and stralsund . 
  `` vorpommern '' differentiates this region from the formerly german territory of hinterpommern which was granted to poland after wwii . 
   i 'd bet you 've never heard of the states of arunachal pradesh or chongqing . 
  i 'll grant you that `` chongqing '' does n't ring any bells , but i 'm pretty sure arunachal pradesh is a himalayan state in northeastern india whose territory is under dispute between china and india because india 's claim is based on a british-tibetan treaty that china says tibet was not empowered to sign and is therefore invalid . 
  if it is unfair to expect europeans to be familiar with our states , then it is certainly hypocritical to act all superior when americans are n't familiar with the republics within the russian federation . 
  it 's also worth pointing out that the geography of europe that my parents ' generation was taught ( in the 70s ) is simply no longer true , while america 's geography has not changed . 
  your parents can pass on accurate information to you from what they learned in school ; you guys enjoy changing your geography so much that the european geography my parents learned in school was obsolete by the time i was born . 
  i think we should go back to calling it bohemia . 
  we do n't . 
  generally , everyone everywhere is better-informed about local geography than distant locales . 
  my friend 's french boyfriend thought boston was the capital of a state called `` new england ; '' my israeli friend thought he could day-trip from boston to chicago ; my german friends could n't name a single city in california . 
  likewise , my coworker thought belarus was a town in massachusetts ( to be fair , it does sound like billerica ) ; my mom still refers to the czech republic as czechoslovakia ( though she knows slovakia is a different country ) ; and when i say my name is from lithuania , i get blank stares and i have to explain in detail where that country is . 
  people on both sides of the pond are woefully ignorant about geography on the other side . 
  the capital of bw is , in fact , [ stuttgart ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baden-w%c3%bcrttemberg ) !, 
  it * would * , but they were n't born in the us . 
  stalin deported the chechens to kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan in 1944 in retribution for the failed chechen insurgency during the second world war . 
  there are apparently still some chechen communities in kyrgyzstan . 
  i got 181/197 . 
  those goddamn caribbean and pacific islands . 
  as am i , and i was joking . 
  do i need to put a '' / s '' if i 'm making a funny ? 
  well , i do n't know how many movies y' all see over there . 
  i figured the only movies you watch are black and white art flicks . 
  just for reference , because a lot of you probably have never heard the call to prayer , [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5amcumuh1c&amp;list=plce525adbf5e2fd96 ) is a youtube video of the call to prayer being broadcast in istanbul . 
  it 's worth pointing out that these troops in some cases are what 's called `` tripwires : '' america stations troops in , say , poland , and when poland is attacked , american troops will be killed and america will be forced to respond with military force . 
  of course , poland could invoke article v of the nato charter , but it 's a gesture of assurance on america 's part to station troops there so that an invocation of article v would not be strictly necessary . 
  twain is by far my favorite american author and the only one i would really wholeheartedly recommend as a representative of american literature . 
  i 'm not really a literature buff , and the literature i do have is overwhelmingly british , but twain is truly excellent . 
  `` yunanistanian '' already has an english equivalent : ionians ( \u1f3c\u03c9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 in greek ) . 
  the difference between south cyprus and north cyprus is like the difference between south and north korea . 
  damn . 
  as an american , i identify britishness both with a stiff upper lip and excessive cleverness . 
  i do n't know if it 's really `` intellect , '' but `` clever '' is certainly a word that pops to mind . 
  fair enough . 
  well , no , they 're not slavic , they 're baltic . 
  both slavic and baltic languages descend from proto-balto-slavic , but they 're still different now . 
  there actually were n't that many jews in germany , and those who did live in germany were almost entirely assimilated to german culture . 
  the vast , vast majority of european jews lived in poland and the ussr . 
  in all likelihood , the average german had never met a jew , while it is much more likely that the average pole would have . 
  uh , what ? 
  the whole point of this discussion is that israel receives a * disproportionate * amount of condemnations from international bodies .
