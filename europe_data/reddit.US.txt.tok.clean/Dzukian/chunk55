  if someone else is doing stuff that 's just as bad and not receiving a comparable amount of international condemnation , then that is absolutely germane to the discussion , since that indicates that israel is not receiving a degree of scrutiny and criticism comparable to countries doing similar things . 
  as for cyprus , let 's remember that the turkish minority ( less than a third of the island 's population ) was demanding that the already-tiny island be split apart so they would n't have to be part of a majority-greek state . 
  there was no way to partition the island to have a turkish majority , so the turks just took half the island and ethnically cleansed the majority of the population so only turks remained . 
  this is n't a kosovo situation where albanians made up a majority in a geographically contained area . 
  the turks were spread all over the island and demanded taksim knowing for a fact that there was no way to draw a line around a turkish-majority area . 
  turkey and its turkish cypriot collaborators have no excuse for the ethnic cleansing of greek cypriots other than shameless land-grabbing . 
  no , but turkey does . 
  it 's occupying an * eu member state * and regularly violates iraqi airspace to blow up kurdish camps in northern iraq . 
  how often is turkey condemned in the un ? 
  likewise , morocco , which the un considers to be in belligerent occupation of the western sahara . 
  how many un resolutions get aimed at morocco ? 
  um , maybe we 're just talking past each other . 
  your argument ( complaint , really ) is only valid if you operate under the assumption that what communism actually is is whatever is laid out in theoretical treatises like the communist manifesto . 
  i prefer to think of communism as `` the way in which all governments that self-identify as communist act . '', 
  no ideology is ever represented purely in the real world : in the real world , what communism is is the common policies adopted by regimes that identify as communist and for which they provide rationales using communist vocabulary . 
  but , i suppose i could edit my original post to say that communis ** ts ** were both stupid and evil , which would be just as true without impugning the nobility of a stupid and evil ideology . 
  that 's what communists believe . 
  given that every single communist state has gotten to socialism and then either catastrophically failed or gone back to capitalism , it seems to me that communism just does n't work . 
  if every single experiment has failed , your hypothesis might just be wrong . 
  if communists continue to believe in a system that has only produced mass murdering regimes , i do n't see why the rest of us ca n't treat them with the exact same disdainful scorn with which we treat their brothers in authoritarianism , fascists . 
  judging by the wikipedia entry on `` centre-right , '' `` center right '' by uk standards is `` center '' ( or `` moderate '' or `` independent '' ) by us standards . 
  our far leftists are the same as your far leftists . 
  the no true scotsmen fallacy is called a fallacy for a reason . 
  well , the right said all along that communism was both stupid and evil , and hey , that was dead-on . 
  * i * like margaret thatcher and deeply respect her , but i 'm an american and therefore a theocratic reactionary to / r/europe . 
  uh , the uk is the 22nd most populous country in the world and within the top ten of gdp by ppp in the world . 
  it 's hardly a `` small country with little industry . '', 
  ugh , really ? 
  that 's unfortunate . 
  learning russian is not something i feel any motivation at all to do . 
  this is true , but the lithuanian archives now are run by people who speak lithuanian . 
  i realize that church records would be in polish , probably , and state records before 1918 would be in russian , but if the people who have access to those documents do n't speak english , then i 'm sol . 
  but if she 's from africa , why is she white ? 
  i 'm half-heartedly leaning lithuanian because my dad 's family immigrated from lithuania ( back when it was still the russian empire ) , so i 'd like to be able to look in lithuanian archives to do genealogy research , and because lithuanian is absolutely fascinating , linguistically-speaking . 
  unfortunately , basically all i can say so far is : a\u0161 nesuprantu lietuvi\u0161kai . 
  it 's surprisingly difficult to learn a language when basically no one around you speaks it and no school in the area offers classes in it . 
  i 'd also like to learn polish , but i 'm not really even trying to do that . 
  edit : i took 7 years of french , and a year and a half each of german and hebrew , so i guess i can communicate in those languages . 
   nope . 
  you seem to have a reading disability . 
  uh , no . 
  you have a memory problem . 
  your posts below clearly imply that israel is exterminating the palestinians and committing genocide . 
   as a german , living with the experiences we had in the last 120 years or so , a people of `` terrorists '' is far more desireable to me than ** an exterminated people ** . 
  and :  what i , a german who had been spoonfed holocaust for most of his school career , can very well identify ghettos , rapant racism and fascistoid behavior when i see them . 
  ** you do n't need extermination camps to create a genocide . 
  and ? 
  on 15 june 1961 , it was true that there was no wall . 
  likewise , itis true that there is no genocide happening in israel . 
  maybe one day there might be , but it is true * today * that there is no genocide . 
  you 're claiming that there 's a genocide happening today , and you have offered no proof for your claim . 
  indeed . 
  two-time president of lithuania [ valdas adamkus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valdas_adamkus ) lived in the us around chicago for decades while lithuania was occupied by the ussr . 
  there were also significant polish and lithuanian communities in worcester , ma ( my grandfather 's family were worcester lithuanians ) , but that community has pretty much assimilated into generic new englanders . 
  they did n't `` abduct '' anyone , and yes , it actually * is * legal to board a ship in international waters if the ship has confirmed its intention to break a legal blockade . 
  indeed . 
  israelis and their leaders are forced to make morally ambiguous decisions all the time . 
  the last time the irish had to make a morally ambiguous decision , * seven decades ago * , it was `` let 's * not * fight the nazis . '', 
  talk about unearned pretensions to moral superiority . 
   you do n't need extermination camps to create a genocide . 
  no , but you do need at least a statistically significant number of murders . 
   which , by the way , did not end well for the warsaw citizens uh , did you miss the rest of the lessons about the holocaust ? 
  like , the extermination camps , the mass shootings , the `` liquidation '' of ghettos ? 
  that 's the actual genocide part , and nothing like those has happened in israel nor are the israelis planning on doing anything like that . 
  have you ever * been * to israel ? 
  anti-arab prejudice there is no more rampant than anti-roma ( or , let 's be real , anti-muslim ) prejudice in europe , and the israelis at least have a logical reason to feel suspicious of arabs . 
  there are of course extremists everywhere , and the nature of israeli politics creates a lot of loudmouth ideologues , but the modus vivendi of israeli life is working . 
   as a german , living with the experiences we had in the last 120 years or so , a people of `` terrorists '' is far more desireable to me than an exterminated people . 
  you 'd think a german , steeped in education about the holocaust , would be able to correctly identify a genocide . 
  there is no `` extermination '' of the palestinians . 
  the palestinian population is neither being extinguished bodily ( the palestinian global population has never once gone down by a statistically significant figure , and many of the largest palestinian death tolls were at the hands of other arabs anyway ) , nor politically ( the palestinians have not one but two self-governing entities within which they have a measure of autonomy , a privilege not enjoyed by tamils in sri lanka or kurds in turkey ) . 
  there is no way you can stretch the definition of `` genocide '' to include the israelis ' occupation of the palestinians . 
  i 'm not a `` shill . '', 
  i speak up for israel when i see an opportunity because israel is -- in my opinion -- unfairly targeted and subject to condemnations that are out of all proportion to how other countries are treated . 
  when media stories like this paint a skewed picture of israel by cutting out important facts or misinterpreting facts , a concise explanation of what 's actually going on goes a long way in making sure criticisms of israel remain as honest as possible . 
  having lived in israel , i know firsthand how conflicted israelis are about their situation and how hard israelis try to make what they see as necessary security measures as light as possible while still defending their lives . 
  for the record , i do n't believe in deleting comments . 
  huh . 
  well , we all do weird things with english sometimes . 
  and prepositions are basically arbitrary anyway . 
  well , apparently hiberno-english is * not * mutually intelligible with general american english ... 
  in american english , `` in '' is used in all cases . 
  * i can get it in ireland . 
  * my friend studied abroad in ireland . 
  * what is life like in ireland ? 
  * the titanic landed in ireland before steaming west . 
  edit : i honestly ca n't think of an example for `` on ireland . '', 
  the title is wrong . 
  the airline stopped her from getting on the flight because :  air france said she was on a list undesirables provided by israel . 
  the airline was therefore aware that she would not be able to disembark in israel . 
  preventing her from boarding was not a problem : the problem was that , for some dumb reason , an airline official asked if she was jewish and made it seem like that was the reason she was n't going to be allowed to board . 
  the idea that non-jews are n't allowed on flights to israel -- which is what the title is implying -- is simply ridiculous . 
  israel has millions of non-jewish citizens and millions of non-jews visit israel every year . 
  i think mcdof was curious about your choice of preposition : '' ** on ** ireland '' instead of '' ** in ** ireland . '', 
  i 'm a native speaker of american english and i always say '' ** in ** ireland . '', 
  do irish people regularly use `` on '' instead ? 
  well , during the interbellum period , poland did actively send polish colonists to podolia , volhynia , polesia , and the other majority-belarusian/ukrainian territories . 
  one could make the argument that the polish central government treated these territories like colonies , even if they were seen as integral parts of the state . 
  i do n't subscribe to that argument , but ukrainian and belarusian nationalists would not find it a difficult argument to make . 
  actually , if you compare this to interbellum poland , it might still be smaller .
