  high five for good taste : krak\u00f3w was my favorite city when i visited europe !, 
  ( i did n't go to vilnius , but it 's high on my priorities list . ), 
  in the american system , you apply to colleges/universities * around a third of the way through your last year of high school . 
  the colleges/universities tell you whether or not you were accepted between december and april , usually . 
  * we do not have the same distinction between `` college '' and `` university '' as the uk does ; i 'm not sure about how ireland works and the wiki article on irish education is not really clear . 
  in the us , tertiary education is referred to as `` college '' whether you go to a college or a university . 
  well , in public schools ( i.e. 
  government-run schools ) here , it 's always test-based . 
  i think some private schools might require a thesis , though . 
  well , in the us you would n't call just any old paper a `` thesis '' in hs ( we 'd use `` essay '' or `` paper '' ) , but if you had to write a substantial paper to graduate or something , it might be called a senior thesis . 
  i think `` dissertation '' is * usually * used only for doctoral candidates . 
  a final paper written by a high schooler , undergrad , or master 's student is * usually * called a `` thesis , '' at least in the us . 
  `` mark '' is a cognate with the english '' [ march ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_%28territory%29 ) , '' which means basically the same thing ( and both are cognates to `` margin '' ) . 
   / r/paradoxplaza  / r/mapporn  / r/linguistics you have * excellent * taste . 
  also , it 's / r/thanksobama / . 
  and as i explained , the commonality between a non-believer ( really , a non-jew ) , a woman , and a slave is that all of them are exempted from some commandments . 
  a free male jew is responsible for fulfilling all of the commandments , and this prayer is thanking god for that responsibility . 
  okay , the important commonality between heathens , slaves , and women is that they are , for a variety of reasons , exempted from some of the commandments issued by god . 
  * heathens , because they are not the children of israel , are responsible only for the covenant god made with noah ( the noahide laws ) , not for the covenant god made with abraham ( the commandments ) . 
  * slaves are waived from fulfilling certain ritual duties for a reason i ca n't remember right now . 
  the point is that there are some commandments they do n't have to follow . 
  * women are waived from commandments that have to be done at a certain time of day . 
  because their duties as a wife and mother can not be interrupted for prayer ( which should indicate to you the priority judaism places on the family and the mother in particular ) , they are exempted from fulfilling commandments that would otherwise be interrupted by their daily duties . 
  ( i think , actually , that the same rationale applies for slaves : a slave is exempted from rituals that must be done at a specific time of day so that their obligations to their master are not unfulfilled . ), 
  again , the prayer is not placing heathens/slaves/women on a level * below * free male jews . 
  the prayer is for a free male jew , who is thanking god for the responsibility of upholding the entire torah , not just parts of it like the other specified categories of people . 
  this really needs to be put in context . 
  the relevant part of the prayer is as follows :  \u05d1\u05e8\u05da \u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc\u05d0 \u05e2\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d2\u05d5\u05d9  blessed are you , lord our god , king of the universe , who has not made me a heathen . 
  ( or , for the ladies : who has made me according to his will ) this is at the beginning of a long series of prayers extolling the deeds of god ( `` who gives sight to the blind , who clothes the naked , who frees the captives , '' etc. ) . 
  the point of these three prayers is for the jewish man to clarify that he is happy to have been blessed with the full breadth of the commandments . 
  heathens ( non-jews ) , slaves , and women are all exempt from at least some of the commandments . 
  a free jewish man is responsible for the all the commandments that are applicable at the time . 
  because jewish thought has traditionally held the responsibility of upholding the commandments as a blessing and not a curse , the free jewish man thanks god that he was not exempted from the joy of fulfilling all of god 's commandments . 
  you can agree or disagree , obviously , but it should be read in context . 
   neither can be reverted , because in this age , only the ethnicity that inhabits those lands matters . 
  which is precisely why ethnic cleansing is the go-to strategy of choice now if you have a separatist minority or if you are a separatist minority trying to justify having independence . 
  the world has been shaking its finger at israel for 60 years about the palestinians because that 's how long the israelis have been ruling over them . 
  but the world does n't really care about how croatia treats serbs nowadays , because the croats do n't really rule over them any more because they were ethnically cleansed . 
  likewise , the expulsion of germans from poland and czechoslovakia are very rarely mentioned , while slovakia does get international flak occasionally for its treatment of the hungarian minority . 
  so , yes , while deciding that today 's demographics may allow us to get over yesterday 's sore spots , we should also realize that this exact mindset may motivate others to imitate our past failures . 
  oh , yeah , rereading your post and op 's , you 're totally right . 
  i have no idea why russians would see ltians as more hostile than latvians or estonians . 
  how bizarre . 
  i actually had to double check the article - it really seems to say lithuania , even though it was us in latvia that used to score in the top 3 for hated countries regularly . 
  i do n't really understand this , russia certainly has a bad relationship with latvia and estonia , but there 's always been less hostility with lithuania . 
  latvia and estonia have large russian populations . 
  these russians are basically settlers , deliberately brought to the northern baltics to dilute and russify the population . 
  estonia and latvia ( for some reason ) never expelled the russians , but have nonetheless put up a lot of barriers to limit the russians ' influence in their countries ( by using language tests for citizenship , not granting citizenship to all residents in the country , etc. ) . 
  russia hates these barriers and pressures estonia and latvia to change them . 
  this makes the relationship between russia and these states really bad . 
  lithuania , on the other hand , never had a really large (  10 % ) russian population , so they never had to put up anti-russian social barriers , and the russians consequently do n't resent them for that . 
  obviously , russo-lithuanian tensions are n't that great because of the whole `` russia invaded and annexed lithuania and exiled or murdered most of the lithuanian intelligentsia '' thing , but they 're still better than estonia/latvia-russia relations . 
  well , in 1913 most of india was under direct british rule , and the rest was under the rule of british protectorates . 
  nationalism is the reason there are tiny countries of 5 million people in europe instead of huge multiethnic empires . 
   talking about communist experiments , no one seems to know about israelian kibbutz : community farms or factory where communism is the rule inside while they act like aggressive capitalist agents on the outside . 
  they account for 10 % of israel 's gdp ( though this also accounts for religious kibbutz ) . 
  successful experiment that no one talks about . 
  almost all israeli kibbutzim have privatized in the last couple of decades . 
  they 're basically just villages at this point . 
  they 're not exactly a successful example of long-term communism . 
  you must find this much funnier than i do . 
  i 've never heard an american talk like that . 
  europeans have really stupid stereotypes of americans . 
   your population of bible belters do not afraid us . 
  we will unleash the hordes of poles to them and selected breeds of italians . 
  this argument makes no sense at all . 
  there are already significant swathes of the country peopled predominantly by italians ( ct and ri ) and there are huge numbers of poles around chicago . 
  we 're over it . 
  we 'll take all the poles and italians you 've got . 
  except there are n't 500 million socialists . 
  scandinavians , britons , dutchmen , and germans share a lot more with americans than they care to admit . 
  so long as we agree to leave your social systems alone , northern europe would probably come to agree with the american perspective on market economics . 
  typing `` your '' instead of `` our '' is a shockingly easy typo to make . 
  if you can vote in ~ ~ your ~ ~ our elections , we get to vote in yours . 
  that 's about 315 million americans voting for the european parliament . 
  what 's that , like 5 frances ? 
  please keep in mind that our population of evangelical christians is greater than the population of germany and the netherlands combined . 
  enjoy . 
  edit : oops . 
  the folks in london may not have considered the irish population to be british ( as the french saw the muslim algerians ) , but ireland itself was considered an essential part of the british isles . 
  they also gave it to anwar sadat after he straight-up invaded another country , so the `` peace '' part of the prize is pretty iffy too . 
  well , the british colonies in the americas were always seen as colonies . 
  ireland , on the other hand , was considered as integral to britain as bristol . 
  coastal algeria indeed constituted three * d\u00e9partements * of france , making them as much france as provence . 
   we declared ourselves sovereign a few weeks ago . 
  it no longer matters which laws the central government do implement or do n't . 
  we are sovereign . 
  did you declare independence ? 
  maybe i 'm remembering this wrong , but i thought your parliament just said that you had the right to be sovereign if you wanted to . 
  there 's a difference between asserting that you are a sovereign entity and asserting that you are no longer a part of spain . 
  it does not seem to me that the catalan parliament said the latter . 
  please correct me if i 'm wrong . 
   spain has the world record of countries that have gained independence from her . 
  3 or 4 more countries to list wo n't be anything new for them . 
  i think the russians might actually have the spanish beat for number of countries that split off from them , but it 's a pretty close race . 
  and anyway , this time it 's different . 
  it 's not some colony on the other side of the world : it 's a territory on the iberian peninsular that 's been a part of spain for half a millennium . 
  it 's certainly a different situation than argentina getting independence , and it 's understandable that the spanish might push back more against this . 
  in the long term , you 're right : assuming the spanish do not militarily occupy catalonia , there 's no real difference between a legal secession and an illegal one . 
  the spaniards would probably get tired of being petty in a couple of generations .
