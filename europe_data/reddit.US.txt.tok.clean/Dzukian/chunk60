  actually , israel does n't really exist because of the holocaust . 
  the process of jewish immigration and building the state of israel started decades before wwii . 
  really the only way the shoah affected the state of israel was by destroying zionism 's biggest source of manpower and capital . 
  american jews were not really on board with zionism until 1967 , but zionism was fairly popular among european jews . 
  israel exists * despite * the shoah , not * because * of it . 
  also , having personally been to both auschwitz and palestine , you really should n't compare the two . 
  the comparison makes palestinians look ridiculous for even suggesting it . 
  as an american , this is basically how i feel about the eu . 
  good for you for articulating it here . 
  the way the eu has historically expanded its powers is so * obviously * antidemocratic that it really boggles the mind as to why so many people so readily support it . 
   on one hand this is funny , on the other hand i do n't get it . 
  just what would the eu gain if the uk were to leave ? 
  i can understand indifference , but how is it beneficial at all ? 
  some french might see a uk exit as removing the biggest obstacle to `` progress '' towards the `` ever-closer union . '', 
  that 's the university of california berkeley , and saying he 's from berkeley does n't disprove at all the idea that he 's a nutty leftist . 
  there are * plenty * of nutty leftists at berkeley . 
  sweden does nothing for a `` peace agenda . '', 
  name one instance when sweden has prevented a war or stopped one from happening . 
  you 're peaceful because you 're weak , not because you 're pacifists . 
  nobody cares about sweden 's opinion . 
  north korea invaded south korea because the us accidentally forgot to mention that they would defend south korea : when 's the last time someone decided not to go to war because of * sweden * ? 
  there * are * non-jewish jacobs and daniels and davids , but those names are at least perceived as being more `` jewish . '', 
   you know man . 
  go fuck yourself . 
  i mean really i do n't wan na take any criticism whatsoever from a country that has barely won 1 military conflict 200 years ( which is by the also the time in which that country has existed ) and is made of europeans who were unfit for our society and slaves . 
  you know , i almost thought you were talking about italy , until i realized that italy has n't been around for 200 years . 
  it 's barely 150 years old . 
  but the `` barely winning 1 military conflict '' is still true . 
  i 'm from new england , so maybe it 's just a catholic thing ? 
  there are a lot more michael , pauls , matthews , patricks , anthonys , etc. 
  up here . 
  all new testament and saints , none of this old testament stuff . 
  i do n't mind the french , actually ( my grandmother is french-canadian ) . 
  it 's really all those self-righteous anglo-canadians that are the worst . 
  uh , what ? 
  english has way more than 5 vowel sounds . 
  this [ ipa chart ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ipa_chart_for_english_dialects ) of english dialects has 27 distinct vowel phonemes in english . 
  general american english has , for example , 25 distinct vowels , though that varies regionally . 
  for example , i do n't distinguish cot and caught , while my coloradan friend does n't distinguish pin from pen . 
  edit : even if you ignore the rhotics and diphthongs , we still have at least 10 vowel sounds . 
  god bless you . 
  to be entirely honest , i 'm surprised by the popularity of jacob , david and daniel in europe . 
  those names are mostly popular among jews in america . 
  that 's fine . 
  it 's a pretty easy mistake to make : children predeceasing their parents does n't happen very often , not it 's not like it 's a situation people talk about . 
  but [ here ] ( http://www.royal.gov.uk/thecurrentroyalfamily/successionandprecedence/succession/overview.aspx ) is the official line of succession as listed by hrm website . 
  try being an american who likes constitutional monarchy . 
   the only other really important detail which is n't just me going on a rant i can think of is that should one of the princes die , before their parent dies then it changes the whole succession order . 
  for instance , if charles dies before the queen does then all of a sudden william is not second in line for the throne and has little chance of becoming king ever due to the succession now deferring to charles 's brother . 
  uh , what ? 
  if charles dies before qeii , then william , being second-in-line , moves up to being heir . 
  in the british monarchy , succession moves down ( to children ) before it moves over ( to siblings ) . 
  for charles ' brother to become king , charles , william , and harry would all have to die ( and will 's kid if the baby is born before this tragic occurrence ) . 
  the line of succession is currently : * qeii * charles , prince of wales * william , duke of cambridge * ( william 's kid ) * harry * andrew , prince of york * beatrice * eugenie * edward , earl of wessex * james , viscount severn * lady louise windsor * anne , princess royal top of the list is the monarch , and each line down represents the next in line . 
  the indentations represent generations : charles , andrew , edward , and anne are queen elizabeth 's children ; william and harry are charles ' children , etc. . 
  there are monarchies where succession passes from oldest to youngest sibling ( saudi arabia , for example ) , but britain is not one of them . 
  edit : because citing your sources is important , [ here ] ( http://www.royal.gov.uk/thecurrentroyalfamily/successionandprecedence/succession/overview.aspx ) is the line of succession as recorded by [ hrm website ] ( http://www.royal.gov.uk/hmthequeen/hmthequeen.aspx ) . 
  a chance to solve a problem is usually called a `` problem '' on this side of the pond ... 
  peasant and * paysan * mean exactly the same thing . 
  it does n't make it any less arrogant to say it * en fran\u00e7ais * . 
  neither are lithuania or latvia . 
   i 've met both english and french `` paysans '' ( farmers/country-side people ) who think that their respective country is somehow ` better ' . 
  the english word you 're looking for is `` peasant . '', 
  his [ second inaugural address ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-obamas-second-inaugural-address-transcript/2013/01/21/f148d234-63d6-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html ) , given yesterday at his inauguration ceremony . 
  it 's not bad , though none of it is surprising . 
  i live in massachusetts and one of my coworkers was on the phone with a minnesotan who said it was -17 fahrenheit outside , which was , apparently , `` a lot warmer than it was last night . '', 
  just sayin ' . 
  siblings have `` sibling rivalry . '', 
  mothers have `` a mother 's love . '', 
   the colonies are its children , so to speak , but europe is its rightful family , its brothers and sisters . 
  i literally do n't know a single person who prefers their siblings to their own children . 
  i 'm from the us and while britain is obviously geographically closely related to europe , i think british culture is obviously more outward-facing and british politics are more atlanticist . 
  i would much rather preserve our `` special relationship '' with the motherland than build a relationship with a fickle and anti-american `` european '' bloc . 
  because the implication is that he believes that israel controls the us congress . 
  it 's as if he said , `` i work for the president , not for the rothschilds , '' implying that his competitors had been bought and paid for in some sort of conspiracy . 
  it 's obviously slanderous nonsense . 
  [ au contraire , mon fr\u00e8re ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_entebbe ) . 
  the uk does n't count as `` europe '' for the purpose of this discussion , since they 're perfectly willing to go it alone . 
  though for the record , the us government overwhelmingly supported the uk for pretty much anything short of actual military aid . 
  we gave materiel and intelligence equipment , and offered to give you a ship capable of landing your harriers on if you lost your aircraft carrier . 
  there was no hemming and hawing on this side of the pond as to who we supported . 
  chutzpah ( rendered in polish as hucpa ) is of hebrew origin , but in all likelihood it was borrowed from yiddish , not directly from hebrew . 
  `` chutzpah '' has different connotations in hebrew and yiddish : in yiddish ( and also in english and german , apparently ) , it refers to a specific kind of brazen or rash courage , while in hebrew , it means simply `` courage . '', 
  there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  i probably misinterpreted the post , but i thought eilinen was saying that europe could offer food ( i.e. 
  non-military economic goods ) as an alternative to america 's military goods , implying that america is essentially a destructive superpower , while europe would act otherwise . 
  the truth is that america produces massive amounts of agricultural products and europe produces large amounts of weapons , so it 's silly to pretend that europe has a distinct moral or economic advantage over the us . 
  i think the general british antipathy towards america is temporary and will disappear as the memories of bush and iraq fade . 
  generally , the uk and the us are strategic allies of the highest order and there is very little latent mutual antipathy amongst both countries ' populations . 
  i do n't know what the op is talking about either . 
  i am american and live in the most irish-populated part of the country ( new england , ironically ) , and people here * love * the uk . 
  britain is our second-favorite country after canada . 
  only in irish bars in east boston will you hear the uk disparaged sincerely . 
  edit : we make fun of the uk for the revolution , but that 's almost always in a joking , loving way . 
  correct : people eat the massive amounts of food that america produces , as the owner of the largest tracts of the most agriculturally productive land on earth . 
  it 's not just neo-nazis . 
  if you replaced `` internationalist jews '' or `` judeo-bolshevists '' with `` zionists , '' then you could spew actual nazi propaganda in the most elite circles of europe and be applauded . 
  aside from a tiny number of isolated incidents of israeli misbehavior which justify superlative criticism , it is frankly appalling what you can get away with saying about `` zionists . '', 
  i wish i could believe that , but it seems so obviously untrue .
