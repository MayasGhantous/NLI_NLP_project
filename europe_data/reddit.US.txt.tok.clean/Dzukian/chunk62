  it does actively protect the right to bear arms . 
  one of the major motivations behind the writing of the us constitution was to create a standing federal navy to combat barbary pirates , so not sure why that second point is relevant . 
   is n't that constitution being violated with the capital punishment ? 
  also , have n't there been changes to the constitution ? 
  how is capital punishment unconstitutional ? 
  and yes , there have been amendments , but that 's because the constitution allows for amendments so that the constitution may be modified to change with the times without being thrown out and rewritten like europeans love to do . 
   why 's the word fuck banned on tv ? 
  only on some channels , and only on tv . 
  that 's not the same as banning something , that 's limiting its presence . 
  and it 's banned because we 're generally a conservative people who think that obscenities do n't belong in the public sphere . 
  that depends on your interpretation of the second amendment . 
  because in america , we do n't just ban things because they 're nasty or inconvenient or we do n't like them . 
  the right to bear arms is enshrined in our constitution , the belief in whose primacy is still the unifying trait of being american . 
  abc ( atomic , biological , and chemical ) weapons used to be used in english , but now the more correct term is cbrn ( chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear ) weapons . 
  there 's a pretty obvious difference between americans working for the american government being blamed for the actions of the american government and danish jews who may not speak hebrew or have ever been to israel being blamed for the actions of the israeli government . 
  even if danes are `` pissed off '' at israel , they have no right to punish random jews . 
  yarmulke and kippah mean the same thing . 
  yarmulke is yiddish , kippah is hebrew . 
  i think both are true , but the fact that there are only a couple thousand jews in all of denmark certainly does make the few instances of antisemitic behavior all the more salient . 
  there 's only about 8,000 jews in denmark , only 2,500 of whom are active synagogue members . 
  i live in boston , which has a metro area population of about 7 million people , and we have over 200,000 jews ... and we are not even considered a `` major '' centre of judaism in this country . 
  the centers of jewish life in the us are new york , florida , and southern california . 
  denmark has so few jews , the fact that there are attacks against any is surprising . 
  edit : i overstated for emphasis . 
  boston * is * considered a major jewish area in the us , but we 're not even close to the bigger centers of jewish life in terms of how many jews live . 
   my reasoning is that had this been a problem with muslims in general , we 'd probably see a lot more than just 37 cases of harassment , while the guy in the shawarma restaurant would probably have faced half-a-dozen raging people instead of merely one , single guy pulling the star from his neck . 
  i think what you 're seeing is a lack of victims ( i.e. 
  not really a whole lot of jews in denmark ) rather than a paucity of assholes . 
  grybauskaite has a black belt in karate , and depending on your definition of `` european , '' netanyahu was in the best specops team in israel . 
  i 'd still put my money on grybauskaite , though . 
  nothing like a fight with the russkies to put the fire under ... well , everyone in europe . 
  though qeii might win among the heads of state because everyone would feel bad hitting such a sweet old woman ... 
  i 've definitely thought about this too much . 
  also stupid , since the uk 's nuclear deterrent is only submarine-based , not in plane-dropped bombs . 
  poland is ethnically homogeneous because of massive ethnic cleansing during and after of wwii , and redrawing of borders . 
  the significant german minority was almost completely expelled after wwii ( for obvious reasons ) , and the country of poland was moved dozens of miles to the west . 
  the lithuanian - , belarusian - and ukrainian-populated parts of the polish republic were annexed by the soviet union , and the poles living there were expelled to poland , where they replaced the germans who were in turn expelled from eastern pomerania , silesia , and masuria . 
  that 's why poland is almost completely populated by ethnic poles , who are almost all catholic . 
  the cultural isolation has to do with decades of soviet censorship and oppression , and lack of immigration . 
  germany has hosted turkish immigrants for generations , while poland has not received much immigration since wwii . 
  greece did n't try to excuse its actions based on the treaty , though . 
  turkey explicitly states that it was justified in invasion , * based on the treaty * . 
  turkey to this day claims that its presence in cyprus -- an occupying , colonizing presence -- is justified by the treaty of guarantee , a lie so obvious that turkish leaders surely do not believe it themselves . 
  you can talk all you want about turkey 's moral right to intervene , but that is not how turkey justifies its invasion to the international community . 
  they justify it using the treaty of guarantee . 
  well , i guess if that 's the way you see it , that 's the way you see it . 
  as for your second point , if the intention of the `` intervention '' was not to restore the legitimate government of cyprus , then it has no legal basis at all . 
  from the treaty of guarantee :  article ii : greece , ** turkey ** and the united kingdom , taking note of the undertakings of the republic of cyprus set out in article i of the present treaty , recognise and ** guarantee ** the independence , ** territorial integrity ** and security of the republic of cyprus , and also the state of affairs established by the basic articles of its constitution . 
   greece , turkey and the united kingdom likewise undertake to ** prohibit ** , so far as concerns them , any activity aimed at promoting , directly or indirectly , either union of cyprus with any other state or ** partition ** of the island . 
  ...  article iv : in so far as common or concerted action may not prove possible , each of the three guaranteeing powers reserves ** the right to take action with the sole aim of re-establishing the state of affairs created by the present treaty ** . 
  it is obvious that the aim of turkey 's invasion of cyprus was not to restore the constitutional government of cyprus . 
  consequently , turkey 's actions were * not * allowed by the treaty of guarantee , and are no different from , say , syria just randomly invading , occupying , and colonizing a third of the island . 
  i have no issue blaming greece for the coup , but there is a world of difference between a coup and an invasion . 
  the coup disrupted the government of cyprus , but the invasion created a whole new demographic and political reality on the island . 
  both greece and turkey acted against their treaty obligations , but turkey 's actions were far worse , affected far more people , and continue on to the present day . 
  in this respect , it is hard not to hold turkey more responsible of graver crimes than greece or the greek cypriots . 
   1 ) can we agree that the invasion stopped said cleansing regardless of what you claim the true motive was ? 
  no , because part and parcel of the invasion was a massive campaign of ethnic cleansing to create a wholly-turkish area in northern cyprus . 
  ethnically cleansing the majority of the population to remove inter-communal tensions does n't get you brownie points for `` stopping ethnic cleansing . '', 
  that 's like saying you stopped a fight by murdering one of the people fighting . 
  it might be technically true , but you 're still a murderer . 
   2 ) is a coup d'etat not a reason for intervention ? 
  it is , but turkey was only justified in intervening if their intention was to restore the legitimate government of cyprus . 
  turkey never reinstalled makarios ' government and never had any intention of doing so . 
  turkey did not restore the legitimate government of cyprus : in fact , it abrogated the territorial integrity of the country by recognizing the trnc . 
  turkey invaded with the intention of taking land for turks -- whether directly partof turkey or a turkish satellite state -- so they have no right to claim that their `` intervention '' was anything other than a naked land grab . 
  i 'm denying something germany admitted to ? 
  what ? 
  i 'm not denying that there was ethnic cleansing , but i 'm saying that ethnic cleansing was not the cause of the turkish invasion . 
  the reason turkey invaded was the 1974 coup d'etat , not ethnic cleansing . 
  it asked the uk to intervene , not the us . 
  the uk declined . 
  do n't shuffle off the blame for this onto us . 
  uh , the greeks ethnically cleansed the turks because the turks were ethnically cleansing the greeks * while invading * . 
  turkey did n't `` have '' to occupy cyprus . 
  it wanted to , and it used a pro-enosis coup as an excuse to enforce the partition of the island that it had wanted . 
  also , before the turkish invasion , there was no significant region in cyprus with a concentrated turkish population which could be separated from the rest of the island to effect `` partition '' into a greek state and a turkish state . 
  no matter where you drew the line , you would have two majority-greek states . 
  the turkish demand for partition was predicated on the idea that at least part of the island would be ethnically cleansed of greeks . 
  attempting to make it sound like occupying an eu member state is not a valid reason to block accession to the eu makes you sound even more ridiculous than your defense of turkish refusal to admit responsibility in the same way that germany has . 
   not only are israel weapons more likely to kill palestinian children than actual militants , [ citation needed ], 
  probably very similar to how gendarmes came to english or turkish . 
  to be entirely honest , i always got ljubljana and skopje confused until i started playing paradox interactive games . 
  those are the only ones i do n't know all that well , though . 
  oh , i 've never seen that .

  brussels ? 
   if by civil war you mean `` states got attacked and ravaged for democratically voting to leave a federation '' , then sure , it 's a civil war . 
  that was pretty much the definition of what happened in the american civil war , which no one contests was actually a civil war .

  there 's actually a [ grimm 's law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grimm%27s_law ) named after jacob grimm that describes the process by which some proto-indo-european sounds became cognate sounds in germanic languages .
