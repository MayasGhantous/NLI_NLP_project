i guess there was a pew-poll one as well , but there are several studies about this case , both turkish and international ( reminder i am talking about kurdish citizens of turkey ) . 
  majority of them ( turkish citizens ) do n't want their own country but a federal state within turkey . 
  you can make a quick google search about that . 
  yeah noticed after reading your post again . 
  my mistake . 
  plus i definitely remember that hotel thing . 
  retards . 
  i guess that was the case when the construction for the marmaray project started . 
  they ran into an old harbor and several ship remnants if i 'm not mistaken . 
  i know , took byzantine history classes during college and i was surprised to learn that was the case . 
  i always thought most of them were standing . 
  also add to that the lost artifacts , such as the hodegetria ( the famous one ) and it is a sad day for people like myself . 
  holy shit , i do owe you one , thanks man really appreciate it . 
  you just made my day . 
  yeah i know , i wonder how they turned it into a mosque ; like seriously i am not an architect but it seems like a difficult job . 
  i would like to see an illustration about it but i do n't think there is one . 
  in terms of originality , roman forum is the most disturbing historical site for me since it consists of several different forums built on top one another . 
  like , why the hell ca n't i see the earlier building ; i guess roman emperors and the senate before them were like `` eff the history buffs , lets just do it for the sake of pissing them off '' . 
  i heard the letter included this emoji at the bottom http://emojipedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/160x160x34-angry-face.png.pagespeed.ic.vhd_haaz41.jpg, 
  unfortunately it is not a new tide , cumhuriyet ( the newspaper ) has always been in support of recognition . 
  it is a complicated issue . 
  some armenians only want the recognition whereas others want reparations and some even land as a part of reparations . 
  it is not unimaginable in terms of international law to enforce reparations upon turkey since it was enforced in the case of germany , which still resumes even in this day . 
  however , turkey can always choose to disregard international law since no one can enforce it via brute force . 
  edit : also see the comment above, 
  depends on the interpretation of international law really . 
  not really related but a good read about the subject nonetheless . 
  i was late look at the picture , but it was already too late since i had written the comment . 
  to be honest i was a bit lazy to change it after , 
  he is n't a greek by the way he is an ultranationalist . 
  however , i thought you meant something along the lines of `` stereotyping '' , my mistake . 
  how does a greek look ? 
  yes, 
  this is a very dangerous argument to make : on the one hand it implies that the murder of innocent civillians can be justified in certain cases and on the other hand it gives the turks benefit of the doubt when they are trying to justify the armenian genocide by claiming that armenians rebelled and sided with the enemy ( russians ) hence deserved the genocide . 
  one should avoid justifying civillian murders whatever the case since there is n't any justification for such matter . 
  i hate him with every possible cell in my body ... and yet i kneel before the altar of his trolling skills . 
  no problem at all . 
  i am not discussing anything , i am not the user that you answered to . 
  double check the user names . 
  i was just commenting on the fact that name calling is not the best way to promote a just case and if he is employing red herring then simply stop answering to him . 
  since , i , too , also have an american flag as my flair ( with a turkish origin ) , i wanted to give you my two cents . 
  you are free to check on my comment history and see my view about the genocide . 
  i can agree with your reasoning just not with your style thats all . 
  what 's atrocious is your remark . 
  i have both turkish and american citizenships , and you are definitely not in a position to dictate which flag i choose to represent me here on reddit . 
  especially when you do n't have any counter argument other than hate . 
  this remark is coming from a person whom actively participated in events for the recognition of the armenian genocide and if you did participate in any such event you would know hatred is the most inefficient way to promote a just cause . 
  edit : check my username , you are not replying to woeski, 
   always : chp [ 1 ] this and also the shepherd in the mountains and his voting capabilities . 
  i have similar one as a turk  i always hoped for it to be in its original form ; as a `` history maniac '' i want all historical artifacts in their original form . 
  if there was a way to separate hagia sophia into its mosque form with its history and into its original form ( this is n't even my final form ) that would be my perfect case scenario not because i give a damn about any religion but only because its historical aspect . 
  i had the same feeling when i saw and read about roman curia and yes i have ocd as well . 
  no , its too easy for us we should merge the continents back into their prehistoric forms then backtrack our steps all the way to the great migration from africa ( which saved the human race from almost certain extinction ) and die in the famine ( by recreating it obviously , duh ) , thus allowing the history to run its peaceful and happy course . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bloody_christmas_ ( 1963 ) yeah all were after the war . 
  also you think rounding up women and children and shooting them to death is the normal response to an invasion . 
  you are a sick person . 
  got ta ask cartmanbro , 
  ninjas are gay . 
  obviously . 
  mit is the secret service of turkey . 
  we have been trying to replicate the genetic base of glorious polish girls , and our efforts are coming to fruition . 
  hence , please give us a few more years . 
  we will `` gib '' it back promise . 
  well then maybe you should have respected the robot . 
   just at the man half of the turks chose to lead them . 
  fify,

  they have never gotten more than 49 % .

  i appreciate the offer , maybe next time . 
  well , i was not expecting this . 
  thanks i guess . 
  hence , you are factually wrong .

  do you even know what absolute majority means ? 
  this subreddit has become a joke lately . 
  edit : so in this sub i can spew my hate against the citizens of a whole country and that is ok ? 
  fuck all the europeans then .

  you are welcome , 
  i know , i just wanted to share :(, 
  it depends some of us probably have armenian , greek and arabic dna whereas there are communities like karachays ( turkic people from caucasus region ) for example , that did not marry outside of their communities . 
  hence , it is highly probable that their genealogy does not contain any greek or armenian dna . 
  he also said `` respect the robot '' so ... there is that . 
  well , you can not deny the logic behind it . 
  reis ? 
   i wonder how he sells this in turkey . 
  he does n't have to since 90 % of the newspapers will not publish this development . 
  hence the majority of his voters will keep harboring anger towards foreign investors , solidifying tayyip 's base even more in the meantime . 
  agreed , us is a shitty 3rd world nation . 
   yet we 're supposed to welcome them with open arms . 
  nazi 's did the holocaust once , a long time ago , and are still vilified to this day .
