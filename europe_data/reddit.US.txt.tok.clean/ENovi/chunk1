his contribution was asking an edgy 14 year old to post actual content . 
  i 'm not `` making exceptions to fit my argument . '', 
  the way the original comment was worded made it seem as if op was saying that class time is set aside to teach the national anthem or recite it regularly during school hours . 
  i apologize if i 've misinterpreted this but `` they get kids to sing it in schools '' does not sound like `` they sing it during a sporting event . '', 
  that was my issue ( well , that and being compared to nk . 
  i think that 's a tad hyperbolic ) . 
  now , since yours is personal experience i 'll share some of mine . 
  i played ( american ) football , baseball , and hockey since i was a kid . 
  when our school would meet to play another school , i can remember the national anthem being sung only a handful of times and i do stand by this being more tied to how national anthems are played during major sporting events in both the united states and abroad . 
  i am being honest with you when i say ( at least in california ) that the national anthem * is * tied to sports but typically only at the professional level . 
  it can be sung at a high school game but again , i would argue that it largely has to do with the tradition of singing it during professional sporting events which , again , is not unique to the united states . 
  i mean , i 've been to enough hockey games that i know the canadian national anthem by heart . 
  it might not be common in europe but the united states is certainly not unique in this regard . 
  we do n't sing the national anthem in school , i do n't know where you 're getting that . 
  if you 're talking about the pledge of allegiance , it is n't mandatory and , at least in my experience , not said very often ( and nowhere near the degree that non-americans insist that it 's said ) . 
  we do sing the national anthem before sporting events but i really do n't see how that is all that bizarre . 
  the same thing happens during the olympics and at canadian nhl and mlb games . 
  also , the shooting in ferguson has nothing to do with patriotism . 
  while we 're at it , let 's keep going south . 
  california : [ yosemite ] ( http://sms111.org/wallpapers/wp-content/gallery/yosemite-national-park_1/summer-sunset-over-half-dome-from-glacier-point-yosemite.jpg ) half dome rock . 
  without a doubt , the most beautiful and awe inspiring place i 've ever visited . 
  [ golden gate bridge ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/75/downtownsf.jpg ) san francisco has a lot to choose from but i settled for the most iconic . 
  you also can not appreciate how big that bridge is until you 've driven across it . 
  [ california redwoods ] ( http://willaustin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/redwoods_080410_0590.jpg ) i picked this photo so people could see how big the tallest trees in the world are . 
  some are also 2,000 + years old . 
  [ california beaches ] ( http://www.huntingtonbeachca.gov/images/visitors-sunset-lg.jpg ) i could n't pick just one beach since the entire southern coastline looks like this . 
  this is a picture of huntington beach , also known as `` surf city , usa . '', 
  it 's the home of the surfing championships every summer . 
  [ death valley ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/mesquite_sand_dunes_in_death_valley.jpg ) it features the lowest point in north america and the hottest air temperature ever recorded at 134 f/56 .7 c [ mount whitney ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/mount_whitney_2003-03-25.jpg/1280px-mount_whitney_2003-03-25.jpg ) is the * highest * point in north america and only 84 miles ( 136 km ) northwest of death valley ( the lowest point in na ) . 
  [ hollywood ] ( http://cdn.la8.net/images/hollywood/hollywood-sign-buildings.jpg ) . 
  not that the city itself is overwhelming but just the history and cultural significance behind it deserved an honorable mention . 
  exactly . 
  this is n't ww2 . 
  nato has a colossal technological advantage over the russians and , like you said , a numerical advantage as well . 
  as someone else pointed out below , russia has modern technology but that does n't mean that their military is modern . 
  the average soldier has outdated equipment ( when compared to western nations ) and not every gun could be plausibly deployed to a western front ( unless russia is okay with leaving every other square inch of border unguarded ) . 
  speaking as the product of russian immigrants , i feel horrible for russians . 
  the absurd propaganda is really propping up a sense of invincibility that , assuming this escalates , will be brutally shattered . 
  of course , i pray that this does n't get any uglier but if it does , russian citizens , through little to no fault of their own , will once again bear the brunt of this . 
  of course , i 'm not a political scientist or anything so i could be totally wrong about russian citizens . 
  my view is largely based on various news sources and the fact that i 'm privy to the arguments of a bunch of old bearded russians . 
  ( not the guy you responded to ) i actually agree with some of your points ( and from what little i 've gathered , most americans regardless of political affiliation also agree ) . 
  i do n't think this is europe 's mentality but it * can * seem , due to the way some news articles are phrased , that europe is basically expecting the united states to carry the majority of the weight if this situation gets any uglier . 
  again , i do n't believe that 's the mentality of europe but i do see how it can be perceived that way . 
  there is also this stereotype floating around that europeans look down on americans until they need our strength . 
  i get all that . 
  however , there 's no two ways about it . 
  if any member of nato is attacked the united states will * absolutely * come to their side . 
  unless the united states is interested in breaking one of the most basic articles laid out by nato ( they 're not ) , we 'll have troops on the ground and planes in the air . 
  so while it might seem like we 're getting dragged into another european conflict ( something americans have never been fans of ) , this one is different . 
  besides , our nato allies need our support ( and we need theirs ) . 
  we are in a unique position in this crisis in that we do n't remotely rely on russia 's energy the same way european nato allies do . 
  it would be really shitty for the united states to sit on their hands and expect europe to take the brunt of this when we have the ability to do a lot more with little to no blowback by russia . 
  yeah , we might bicker as nations but the united states stands by europe and europe stands by the united states . 
  oh , and you know how earlier i mentioned european stereotypes and how they can taint the view that americans have towards europe ? 
  it goes both ways . 
  your point was n't wrong or right . 
  it was an opinion which is encouraged . 
  however , you did n't really leave any room for dialogue and kind of sounded like a dick . 
  if you offered your point of views constructively you would probably be far more positively received . 
  no need to act like a chode while you 've got an american flag next to your name . 
  do n't bother to try to figure it out . 
  you 'll just get a headache . 
  maybe it 's because you guys are n't used to it or do n't hear about it on a weekly basis but getting miffed at fox news is pretty played out here in the states . 
  basically an eye roll and a head shake is the only response . 
  i remember when it was a big deal for someone on the network to make a radical or outrageous claim . 
  there would be debates and it would be talked about quite a bit . 
  now their act has played out and it 's basically just a circus . 
  it helps that there are actual news outlets with a conservative slant available that do n't rely on absurd claim and ( not to sound like the typical reddit liberal ) blatant lies . 
  what 's sad though is that there are actual journalists working for them who actually do produce legitimate pieces of news . 
  it just gets drowned out by bullshit like this . 
  you have far more patience than me to actually try to get a reasonable answer out of this guy . 
  although to be fair , i have n't actually tested what he 's saying . 
  there was this asian guy i worked with awhile ago who was a total prick , causing us to butt heads quite a bit . 
  maybe i should have thrown a racial slur at him ( i 'm thinking something like the krusty the clown bit [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owz7i7apghq ) ) . 
  when hr would inevitably call me in to explain myself , i could just say that i was n't being a racist at all . 
  i just do n't like the guy . 
  i 'm positive they would have understood because throwing around racial slurs due to not liking someone is perfectly reasonable . 
  in case someone is dense , that last sentence was sarcasm ( except the part about the guy being a prick . 
  he was the worst ) . 
  he either really thinks this way or is the internet 's shittiest troll . 
  over half his comments are in the most random subreddits and they all have to do with calling a black person some racial slur . 
  also , he posts in okcupid and tinder . 
  i am absolutely shocked that this guy does n't have a girlfriend . 
  [ just neckbeard things . 
  we should get a nice prime number of states . 
  53 should do . 
  `` one nation , indivisible ... '', 
  l.a. does n't have a large cuban population either . 
  the largest hispanic ethnic group comes from mexico followed by guatemala and el salvador . 
  you 're either thinking of miami or just assuming everyone from latin america is interchangeably cuban . 
  also , i do n't know what having cuban citizens means one way or the other when it comes to a panoramic of a city . 
  your post history is delightful . 
  i just wish you could decide on one spelling of `` yankee . '', 
  yup . 
  all of africa was just one monolithic culture of savages ( you can tell they were all one culture because they 're all black ) . 
  it took the messianic arrival of the white europeans with their fancy book learning to cure those savages . 
  now this does require you to completely disregard all of the great sub-saharan empires and city-states such as the mali empire , ghana empire , songhai empire , ashanti empire , ethiopian empire , etc. 
  but those are merely exceptions , right ? 
  after all , history only revolves around the western world ( except when china sneaks in from time to time ) .
