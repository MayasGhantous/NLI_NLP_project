  that 's the issue - trade would cripple ukrainian domestic production . 
  without aid - or the visa-free travel , or the language about eu ascension , it 's a crippling move for ukraine . 
  currently all three are off the table . 
  i read maybe half of the article before i realized that , having read half of the article , i 've read nothing save rhetoric . 
  `` yeah , fuck energy independence ! '', 
  said no competent leader ever . 
  multiculturalists would point out that this is the result of a rejection of muslims by society . 
  a link ? 
  of course . 
  why would ukraine want to break off relations with its largest neighbor ? 
  however you are delusional if you think ukrainians , russian-speaking or not , are dreaming of being a puppet state . 
  is there something that makes you think that russian-speaking are fundamentally incapable of joining the european project , other than bigotry ? 
  ukrainians are ukrainians - even if they speak russian . 
  no one wants to join the russian federation - at most , they do n't want to be disenfranchised . 
  i 'm from eastern ukraine , where every single person i grew up around is russophonic - to take away their right to legally represent themselves in the language they spent their lives speaking for the sake of a political point - well , that 's just bigoted . 
  as for my being american - i am , and i 'm proud of how the us handles multiculturalism . 
  it 's one of the things we have n't fucked up . 
  what exactly is disgusting about having the language that 's spoken fluently by well over half of the population be an official language ? 
  what 's disgusting is the marginalization of people based on something as trivial as the language they speak . 
  just yesterday i was exposed to the stereotype that austrians are extremely anti-semitic ; interesting how this reinforces that . 
  you hold the seed in your hand , your the front teeth to break it , and then you keep the shell in your hand . 
  thus , using your hands . 
  ( my issue was with spitting the seeds out . ), 
  that is ** not ** how civilized people eat sunflower seeds . 
  use your hands , damn it . 
  native speaker , far more that 10 % speak russian in the west . 
  if only the eu actually wanted ukraine - perhaps none of this violence would be happening today . 
  the association agreement removed all language regarding a route to eu membership ( this is unlike previous association agreements ) and the eu offered ukraine no support against russian trade sanctions or our dependence on russian gas . 
  this is all very sad . 
  a nation yearning for prosperity and the eu looking down and saying `` to prosper , you must suffer at the hands of russia , you must suffer as your industry collapses , you must suffer as your people freeze to death because you ca n't afford the gas to heat the homes of 46 million at the above-market price that european darling timoshenko guaranteed to russia , you must sell your agricultural land , and then perhaps we 'll begin discussions regarding membership . '', 
  antinationalism and antipatriotism is now a neocon position ? 
  is black white ? 
  are cats barking where you live ? 
  he quite clearly posed europe as the desirable option by calling its death fertilizer . 
  did we not read the same article ? 
  no , because it was n't the usa forcing the landing , it was espa\u00f1a and several other european states that would n't grant the airplane passage . 
  it 's one of the most fertile lands in the world , and a source of cheap labor that 's closer to home than china . 
  you seriously think they want to be hated ? 
  would n't it be wonderful if they have him asylum because he 's a political exile ? 
  or , maybe because he exposed massive nsa human rights abuse ? 
  instead it 's this conditional bullshit . 
   and why should n't he send the african refugees back to italy , if there are no valid reasons to grant them asylum in germany ? 
  pawning off a european issue onto the border states . 
  situations like this are why there is such a distrust of germany . 
  airnow.gov is a valid source . 
  here is one for copenhagen . 
  an example from the us : http://www.numbeo.com/pollution/city_result.jsp?country=united+states&amp;city=boston%2c+ma copenhagen : http://www.numbeo.com/pollution/city_result.jsp?country=denmark&amp;city=copenhagen & a second source for boston : http://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_city&amp;cityid=69 i ca n't find an equivalent for copenhagen . 
  point is - two similar cities , usa wins out - so stop being a bigot . 
  all this is , as you pointed out , is protectionism . 
  the eu ca n't compete on merit , so it 's drawing up these rules under the guise of privacy protection - while in truth the entities that violate privacy can trivially ignore these rules . 
  ( & it 's not a bad thing from the point of view of a european - more local services means a stronger economy , so do n't go out and protest , but do n't pretend this is anything but real politik . ), 
  what have the police accomplished ? 
  have they created a safe environment for the children ? 
  are they now protected ? 
  it 's not an ad hominem , it 's an attack on the idea that the us is only able to borrow as much because of the dollar - clearly false , when the uk which uses the pound borrows similarly and their currency is n't the global reserve . 
  which says what ? 
  that the us 's massive debt is completely manageable . 
  `` vast , vast amounts of debt '' as a % of gdp is quite similar to the uk . 
  huh , i imagined it as a much more densely populated city . 
  it 's ukraine 's current leadership that 's pushing for this and they hail from the east . 
  it 's rather offensive to suggest that eastern ukrainians would rather be subservient to russia - mostly they just want their heritage respected . 
  that seems to have been accomplished with the passage of the 10 % language law . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automat is this what you mean ? 
   why is there a growing anti-european sentiment on reddit ? 
  because of people \\* like this . 
  \\* i started with a less polite term . 
  there 's nothing less evil about russia 's stance on syria - their side is winning , that 's the only difference . 
  if assad was losing russia would be much more hawkish and obama would be the one saying `` stay out , motherfucker , international law , yada yada . '', 
  if you look at the non-syrian ramifications , this lets russia keep its only military base and says to the middle east that if you get in bed with them they have your back . 
  which is rather unfortunate if you 're anyone but russia . 
  the only possible positive global effect from this would be if the eu reinvigorated their talks with ukraine . 
  is that all ? 
  for all of this talk of how they 're living it up on the german dime , 1200 euro 's a month split six ways is a poverty wage . 
  it 's something to help you get off the ground , i guess . 
  how underwhelming . 
  it does make the racism claims more credible , when the exploitation spoken of likely is n't enough to feed and house them . 
  i think it 's just this subreddit . 
  i vaguely recall some talk of a far-right group attempting to `` raid '' / r/europe . 
  actually , this might be an issue of terminology - what is a `` 1 bedroom apartment ? '', 
  i know in the usa it 's an apartment with at least a two rooms , ( one bedroom , one livingroom ) + either a separate kitchen or one as part of the livingroom . 
  a smaller 1-bed would be maybe 60 square meters . 
  ( whereas in ukraine , for example , a `` 1 bedroom '' has no livingroom - just a small kitchen and an attached room , what would be called a `` studio '' in the usa . ), 
  http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=netherlands&amp;country2=united+states&amp;city1=amsterdam&amp;city2=boston%2c+ma look at that . 
  in the original link the apartments are segregated by `` in city center '' and `` outside city center '' and those in the city center are still dirt cheap , unless `` city center '' also applies to little village communities . 
  in boston , paying 1250 euro 's a month for a 1 bedroom is considered a good deal . 
  christ , you folks have cheap housing . 
   local police spokesman michal sienkiewicz ... said about 40 people in total were involved in the brawl . 
   the mexican foreign ministry said in a statement that 57 cadets and officers from the cuauhtemoc training ship had been taking a break on the beach when they had been assaulted by some 300 `` alleged fans of a soccer team '' . 
  that question is a hard on as the `` american '' culture * is * multiculturalism . 
  it 's a culture built around several civic ideas rather than any more traditional one , and i consider that multiculturalism superior to anywhere else i 've been but not necessarily the other details of our culture . 
  right ? 
  it 's like polling mass and vermont to get the american view . 
  '' ... but our culture is superior to others . '', 
  i blame my politicians for my nation 's problems . 
  if i were to do as you do rather that as you say , i 'd go ahead and blame putin . 
  'cause fuck it , it 's them guys over there ruining my nation !, 
  you know , glen 's articles had a lot to say about the uk domestic spying program . 
  could it be that the uk acted to the benefit of the uk ? 
  nah , must be the american boogeyman . 
  honestly , it 's neither on ukraine nor russia at this point .
