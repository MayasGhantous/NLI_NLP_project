  the decision lies with the eu - ukraine has many times expressed their desire to sign the association agreement , and have taken many steps towards it , failing only to release a woman who , in a rare instance of justice ( selective as it was ) was convicted of a crime she was guilty of . 
  if anything , they should be pressing for more enforcement of anti-corruption laws . 
  i wish prices actually went down with the bubble . 
  i swear , the nyc/boston version of the housing crash was rent staying flat for a few years . 
  well . 
  wow . 
  i guess my idea of ireland was far too romantic . 
  it 's more of an incentive to use the `` sick leave '' loosely . 
  headache ? 
  maybe tomorrow . 
  i can also split my days up - take half a day sick , then half another day . 
  it mostly just prevents me from using them for long planned vacations . 
  that 's pretty fantastic . 
  excluding holidays i get 27 paid days off , but 10 of those are officially `` sick '' days . 
  do your 30 days include national holidays , or are those 30 personal days ? 
  only if you want your food to spend its entire lifetime covered in car exhaust . 
  it 's a fund idea , but no thanks . 
  i 'm pretty sure / r/europe is exactly the place for this . 
  so , where is the outrage ? 
  where are the half-dozen `` boycott the uk '' posts ? 
  is that reserved for americans ? 
  `` ruble '' in ukraine , from soviet times . 
  who is `` we ? '', 
  sweden has the fra law which is much worse than the patriot act as like 95 % of common websites are hosted outside of sweden . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fra_law the uk has gchq . 
  the eu itself basically has legislated prism . 
   european union [ edit ] ** the legislative body of the european union passed the data retention directive on 2005-12-15 . 
  it requires telecommunication operators to implement mass surveillance of the general public through retention of metadata on telecommunications and to keep the collected data at the disposal of various governmental bodies for substantially long times . 
  [ clarification needed ] access to this information is not required to be limited to investigation of serious crimes , nor is a warrant required for access . 
  ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_surveillance#european_union, 
  ha , if you think your government is n't spying on you you 'd fit right in with most americans . 
  here are a couple of the more explicit examples : http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jun/07/uk-gathering-secret-intelligence-nsa-prism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fra_law, 
  `` civil unrest ? 
  blame the jews ! '', 
  come on . 
  really ? 
  at worst , the host asks for $ 5 and you drink to your heart 's content . 
  very racist , more or less well off , good social services , not very good `` melting pot '' mentality , popularity of far-left parties hides far right party 's presence , beautiful landscapes , expensive . 
  snark away , but i 'm serious . 
  does `` center '' mean something different in british english ? 
  the previous examples were false friends so it follows this one is also one . 
  british english in ukraine . 
  what does centre mean ? 
  what bullshit . 
  both '' \u0433\u0435\u0439 '' and '' \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439 '' are used , the latter being native slang and the former being the more chic imported version . 
   british diplomats are understood to share the belief that there may have been a legitimate case against ms tymoshenko . 
  however , they also contend that she is most likely the victim of selective prosecution , and that in a country known for high-levels of official corruption , many other officials should also be in the dock as well . 
  she should n't be pardoned . 
  she 's guilty . 
  this is pretty much universally accepted . 
  true , she is a victim of selective justice , but the solution is n't to release the guilty , it 's to demand further persecution of corrupt government officials . 
  europe is ridiculous in its tymoshenko-related demands . 
  yo germany , i 'm really happy for you and i 'm going to let you finish but the holy roman empire was the one of the best empires of all time . 
  of all time . 
  well that 's just foolish . 
  russia is both actively courting ukraine and trying to force it into a trade agreement using gas prices . 
  if ukraine has been holding out for europe , but if europe rejects it then it 'll go to russia . 
  ... i do n't know which to expect . 
  so a city building a wall to segregate them is somehow not institutional ? 
  so the point is that saying `` i 'm from america '' is about is descriptive as saying `` i 'm from europe . '', 
  you made my point exactly . 
  that 's because most european nations could fit in texas and have less people than nyc . 
  that 's brilliant . 
  in america a `` handy '' is a dirtier thing . 
  kolyadki are basically christmas carrols . 
  ukraine : christmas is in january , it is a strictly religious holiday . 
  we have festivities on new years eve . 
  customs : grandpa frost ( secular santa ) brings presents with the aid of his granddaughter snowchild ( `` snegurachka '' ) . 
  we decorate a tree , lots of tinsel , lots of orbs/animals , lights , a big red star on top , presents go under the tree , to be opened on new years day . 
  if you 're at a public spectacle you 'll see an incompetent frost who needs the children to yell `` snegurachka '' for her to come help , then everyone dances around the tree and sings songs . 
  on nye you clean your house , and at midnight you open all doors and sweep out the old year and welcome in the new year . 
  food : anything and everything , with lots of vodka . 
  very festive . 
  edit : most cities have fireworks , and big trees in public squares . 
  le sigh . 
  well yes , i was speaking very generally about europe , not about any specific state or its immigrants . 
  you know what would get you a lot closer to getting rid of `` barbaric '' halal slaughter ? 
  ( which , by the way , is a small part of `` halal . '' ), 
  praise the progressive nature of it - how it advocates for the humane slaughter of animals when slaughter was much less humane than halal . 
  then ask `` what would the prophets advocate with access to modern technology ? '', 
  then point to the religious scholars that claim that support the idea of anesthetics for the animals before they are drained , so they feel no pain . 
  people largely react to your words , not your desires . 
  if you attack they 'll attack back . 
  where do you live , exactly ? 
  i know it 's not in chinatown , or flushing , where there are large cantonese and mandarin populations , respectively . 
  i know it 's not at brighton beach which is russo-phonic . 
  i know it 's not in the hasidic parts of williamsburg ( or fuck it , even the hipster parts of it ! ), 
  or in korea town , or in astoria 's little egypt or in spanish harlem , or etc. 
  nyc is incredibly multicultural , which numerous neighborhoods where you can live your entire life and never need to speak english . 
  the city has several recognized official languages . 
  the city has orthodox jews , muslism , and christians , the city has buddhists and atheists . 
  step the fuck outside . 
  it 's one of the most multi-cultural places on earth . 
  he 's advocating for the abolition of hypocrisy . 
  it is op and his kind that advocate for intolerance based on language spoken , while failing their mother tongue . 
   from what i know ... you know very little . 
  educate yourself . 
  i like how under the guise of anti-racist you made a blanket statement regarding the functionalty of multiculturalism . 
  as a matter of fact , it does work ; and it works brilliantly . 
  nyc is my specific local example , but the usa and canada are both very diverse , multicultural and successful nations .
