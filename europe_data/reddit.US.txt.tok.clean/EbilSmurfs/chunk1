** race is a social concept used to categorize humans into large and distinct populations or groups by ** anatomical , ** cultural ** , ethnic , genetic , geographical , historical , linguistic , religious , and/or social ** affiliation ** . 
  even if you are right , that is still racism . 
  not even by a stretch , the definition of race includes cultural affiliations . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/race_ ( human_classification )  race is a social concept used to categorize humans into large and distinct populations or groups by anatomical , cultural , ethnic , genetic , geographical , historical , linguistic , religious , and/or social affiliation . 
  the ` muslim ' category fits 4 to 6 of the 9 categories . 
  if that does n't count as a ` race ' nothing does and it 's impossible to be `` racist '' . 
  stop pretending you are n't racist because you do n't hate blacks and realize that race is more than just the color of someones skin . 
  do they not teach equivalencies at your school ? 
  if you stop people because of their color in one country , it is * equivalent * to stopping people for their color in another country . 
  racist policies in one country are racist in another country and you pretending they are n't just looks bad for you . 
  it 's not racist to say , `` muslims are 1/3 of our prison population . '', 
  it * is * racist to say , `` we should encourage our cops to stop muslims because they are clearly more violent . '', 
  it 's the same in the us , by stopping 5x more black people they end up putting more black people in jail . 
  putting them in jail is not racist , but focusing on one specific group of people to stop is racist . 
  just like a german to love fascism . 
  keeping power spread out and in the hands of people , it 's like the country never learns . 
  ( / s ; i 'm not convinced people will understand the sarcasm ), 
  i 'm my work we occasionally have to deal with munitions from the civil war . 
  i deal with underground stuff . 
  american here , why are you so right ? 
  it hurts my soul . 
  it 's a real word . 
  just because you have never used it does n't mean it 's not real . 
  i doubt you know what a gabelle is either , but it 's also a real word . 
  in this instance they mean the same thing , but yes . 
  the bsp is both steadily declining and stable on it 's decline it is not very erratic . 
  yes and no , it determines it 's relative strength . 
  if the yen were worth 100x more tomorrow than it is today then the entire dynamic of the yen would change . 
  currently the yen is worth about a usd penny and that 's good . 
  if it drops to 100 yen is a penny and is consistent that is good in a different way . 
  what you do not want is a currency that is n't consistent . 
  you do not want your currency to be worth 1.5 usd one day and 0.8 usd 10 years later , that means your currency is losing it 's strength in the market . 
  feel free to correct me if i 'm wrong , but that 's how i have been lead to believe currency strength works . 
  you 're right , stability is the wrong word . 
  it 's been stably declining since the 1950 's , but it 's stable . 
  i should have said , `` the bsp is stably declining and not erratically behaving . '', 
  the pound has dropped 50 cents from it 's exchange rate from it 's value in my lifetime when compared to the usd . 
  the euro has doubled it 's value when compared to the usd in my lifetime . 
  which one are you calling stable again ? 
  it 's not lack of vacations , it 's lack of funds for emergencies that could instead be used for vacations . 
  the article , implicitly states that you need 1k disposable for vacations . 
  the money does n't have to be used for vacations , but the fact that 40 % of eu citizens do n't have 1000 euros that is disposable was my biggest takeaway . 
  us checking in , pretty accurate here too . 
  my sister and brother ca n't afford vacations and my parents idea of a vacation is travelling 100 miles and spending $ 300 for the weekend . 
  we may not be as good as you see . 
  the way the eu talks about roma 's and eastern europeans is pretty much on par with the way the us talks about mexicans and central/south americans . 
  i love watching the hate the eu members have over there for each other [ immigrants ] . 
  as an american it 's refreshing to know that you have the same issues we have for the most part , we just hate our own members enough to make them miserable and not provide basics for them . 
  a technocracy is defined as being governed by `` elite technical experts '' . 
  i have yet to see reasonable proof those in power qualify as technical experts . 
  ruled by a group of elite with power is n't a technocracy , that sounds more like a monarchy to me . 
  what am i missing ? 
  it 's how stephen colbert got around the litigious nfl while he was talking about the super bowl . 
  he was possibly going to get sued if he had said it . 
  i know more than a few muslim 's . 
  you all speak from a ridiculous stance of bigotry . 
  the caricature of muslims i see so oft repeated here would be the equivalent of expecting all americans to fall under the / r/murica subbreddit . 
  it 's a very clear cut case of confirmation bias/group attribution error . 
  you see some muslim 's say something heinous but you do n't notice the ones who are not what you expect them to be . 
  i learned most people i know are muslim 's over ramadan because they no longer go out to lunch with us . 
  they are n't sympathetic to syria or anything , they are normal people like you an i except their religion . 
  there are ~ 1.6 billion muslims in the world . 
  ~ 287 million in the usa . 
  eu is bit hard to get numbers on right now for obvious reasons . 
  if mulsims were the monolith this subreddit seems to think they are the us would have a vastly different response . 
  as it is , only fox news talks about it and they get muslims confused with sikh very often . 
  think about it , if you can confuse sikh and muslims i think we can clearly conclude you ca n't identify a muslim very well . 
  are you one of those people that thinks gdp is what matters and we should be ignoring the median income ? 
  i do n't even care anymore . 
  i 'm not going to explain how dumb you are , it 's the internet and you have every right to remain uninformed or work against your own interest . 
  i just hope that you are n't displaced by the uk 's perverse drive to fuck themselves just like america does . 
  the uk is forsaking it 's own citizens for the sake of foreign money and is going so far as to displace neighborhoods so that rich people will buy a 3rd or 4th home . 
  but you seem to be alright with that , so good luck . 
  i really hope you are n't one of the thousands negatively effected by the economic policies you seems to want to keep pushing . 
  yes . 
  i made a joke about how not to handle the situation by comparing it another time where high unemployment had already existed and we know what did not work very well . 
  i would argue that the systematic privatization of utilities should be considered trickle down . 
  additionally refusal to ; create fair tax brackets , create a decent social safety net , and tax breaks for the already well off should also be considered trickle down . 
  finally , not fixing the changes that were clearly part of trickle down should not count as `` stopping '' trickle down . 
  considering ** everything ** i just named , especially because it 's all been done in the past 10 years in the us , i think it 's fair to state that the us is still working on trickle down theory just to a lesser extent . 
  i 'm not ; i 'm linking giving large amounts of money to people already rich as a bad plan to fix unemployment . 
  has n't worked anywhere yet why would it work now . 
  you 're right , it was n't illegal . 
  any fuck-up could have told you everything that went into place before hand was a bad idea ( and many , many fuck-ups in government did but more disagreed with them ) . 
  the us allowed banks to use savings accounts as capitol on those accounts , what the fuck is up with that in the first place ? 
  if you really think it was unavoidable , just keep pushing for reducing taxes on the richest and increasing them on everyone else , because you would be arguing for anything but a sane policy anyway . 
  it 's infuriating how people pretend the rich deserve to abuse and fuck everyone else just because of who has the money . 
   the response would be that those are obviously needed . 
  for me the concern is about to big to fail responsibilities , not that we 've a large finance sector , if i had a good solution for ensuring that we do n't end up with highly correlated distributed entities that together were resilient to shock you realize the economy did quiet well before we let banks gamble like we do now right ? 
  i get it , the rich have done a great job of making it look like they should be untouchable and you bought it , but in the history of the world we did fine why is it required now that we allow non-nations to get so large that when they fail they can impact the world ? 
  we have regulation in place to deal with this , we can easily toughen it and create disincentives to the risky behavior that caused the problem in the first place . 
  we can put crippling costs to the risky behavior on the individual level to stamp out the bullshit that runs rampant in the financial sector already . 
  we are n't hamstrung here , you are just so convinced we have no options because i guess the rest of history never occurred that we ca n't do anything . 
  you are wrong and scared or misinformed . 
  either way , we have answers the politicians just do n't care because they want the money too . 
  sure it 's worse in the us , but the uk is really bad about how open they are about the free handjobs they give the rich when the relocate poor people too . 
  you are 100 % wrong , unless you are being pedantic in which case get fucked i 'm not here to argue that since one outlier is n't doing something we can ignore everything else . 
  get your facts straight , go look at kansas and tell me reaganomics is n't being pushed . 
  i literally live in the state that is failing in every way because of the push to reaganomics . 
  they are n't the only one , wisconsin is in the same boat just further behind .
