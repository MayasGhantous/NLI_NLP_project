  it 's easier to get ahead of these things than catch up . 
   our `` right wing '' is more left than anything you would find in for example the states . 
  this fact is lost on so many americans it 's a bit scary . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism  racism consists of several different and often related ideologies centered around the concept of race . 
  modern variants are often based in social perceptions of biological differences between peoples . 
  these can take the form of social actions , practices or beliefs , or political systems that consider different races to be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other , based on presumed shared inheritable traits , abilities , or qualities . 
  it may also hold that members of different races should be treated differently it 's not like the definition i am using is that hard to come across is all i 'm saying . 
  you 're not perfect here . 
  it 's not criticizing that is really the problem , it 's treating them as inferior for no reason . 
  `` that culture is sexist and that is not ok '' is not racism , `` that culture is not ok ( because it is not mine ) is racism . 
  it 's not always as easy to see , but there are times it clearly shows up . 
  i do n't like you because you are a muslim is racist , i do n't like you because you feel women are inferior is not racist . 
  are we following ? 
  it can be confusing i understand . 
  everytime i see someone say this it looks like a code-word for `` has black people '' . 
  so i see you clearly ca n't or wo n't read my response to you . 
  since you do n't seem to want to , i 'll just link my first 10 for you to read . 
  i see 1 person randomly yelling fuck the usa and i see 1 person completely unaware of what the usa has to offer yet still willing to move here . 
  and yes , the first post is from an american so i gave you 11 to make sure you do n't bring it up .

  i 'm more than a few replies into this thread and it all seems right to me . 
  have you been in a super market in europe and the us ? 
  the posts seem to have that one nailed down . 
  differences in supplied support via government is covered well too . 
  you may be the person ignorant about america if you think the posts i 've seen are mostly factually incorrect . 
   they do n't have the champions league yeah we do !, 
  it 's on at like 3pm too , the perfect time to take an early day and run to the bar . 
  the usa does a lot to get people to hate iran . 
  since we all know how much impact the us has with it 's messaging , it 's hardly surprising to see people parroting their point . 
  i 'm not saying iran is great , just that it is not as bad as fox news and many other us media outlets claim it is . 
   700 for a round trip from budapest to washington via london currently 1200 usd round trip is the cheapest i can find for kc to brussels via chicago, 
  1 ) i want to move to europe long term so keeping up with the events in europe is helpful . 
  2 ) i have friends in belgium and germany so it 's nice to know what is going on around them and things that could effect them . 
  3 ) i like to know what is going on in the world . 
  4 ) / r/worldnews is a joke . 
  man you are on point here . 
  keep up the good work . 
  good thing i have you tagged as racist already . 
  you clearly do n't understand institutional sexism either . 
  waay to far down in the thread before i find a reasonable response . 
  it does say `` hypertext '' links , which is different than embedded links . 
  in-case anyone has the same question i had . 
  where at ? 
  every place i 've been in europe is sorely lacking in the culinary delight that is a bagel . 
  when i was in nantes i wanted one so badly i asked a random bakery if they knew what i was looking for and the best they count think of was `` donut '' . 
  seriously , i want to know where to find a bagel . 
  does germany or belgium have a reliable way ? 
  i think there are only 2 places in all of brussels that have bagels . 
   a disaster . 
  i mean , you guys already do n't have bagels . 
  if the remaining jews leave you guys are fucked . 
   you have to be incredibly stupid and biased . 
  why ? 
  the us government has already shown that it had plans to commit false flag attacks on us soil to get the population into wars it wanted . 
  they have also sterilized sections of the us population as an experiment and dosed others with lsd . 
  the us government has done a lot of fucked up things . 
  knowing all of that stuff do you still think there is a negligible chance they were involved directly on some level ? 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sterilization-united-states_us_568f35f2e4b0c8beacf68713 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/project_mkultra https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_northwoods i do n't even think the us government made it happen , but let 's not pretend it 's a ridiculous thought that the us government could do something that terrible . 
  if that were what we call `` no go zones '' then most large us cities have no-go zones too . 
  however that 's not what a `` no-go zone '' means , when it was brought up it initially it meant that police did n't go there . 
  at this point you are warping `` no-go '' to mean `` slightly dangerous '' . 
  i think we can all agree those are two very different things . 
   why was the first engine invented in europe and not somewhere else ? 
  that 's actually what i was trying to get to but i wrote that while leaving my house . 
  it 's pretty widely held that access to coal was limited by the water in the mines which is where europe got the head start . 
  in order to get to the coal underwater a method had to be invented to remove the water . 
  this was where the steam engine first started , removing water from coal mines . 
  europe had to keep refining the engine , which began giving them the technological edge . 
  no other areas of the world had to refine the steam engine like europe , and i doubt anyone would have expected it to be nearly as important as it turned out to be . 
  or iran , or the continuous support of saudi arabia in the face of their human rights approaches . 
  the list goes on . 
  no , it just moves the problem . 
  when you gentrify you take the poor people who are already hard up and disperse them . 
  this moves them away from their social nets which are more important to poor people , moves them away from their jobs which are less replaceable to those who can not afford a savings , and since the poor do not own their houses as often as rich people they do not benefit from the increased costs to the area . 
   `` witte vlucht '' ( `` white flight '' ) is used to describe the increasing number of white parents ( but not exclusively white ) moving their children from `` black schools '' to `` white schools '' . 
  white schools tend to perform better on tests and parents see it as giving the children more oportunities for later in life . 
  this is one of the issues where europe should learn from the us . 
  we have been dealing with this socially for 40 years and parts of our country are getting better at handling it . 
  i would recommend st.louis , mo as a reference ( not a standard , still not a great place ) for revitalizing a city while incorporating poor and refugee elements . 
  yes st.louis is violent , but i think it 's downtown has come a long way in the past 10 years alone and the violence is more about the police than anything else . 
  it 's worth pointing out that gentrification may be more expensive overall . 
  it hurts the poor and creates a larger gap in wealth than there was without providing pick-me-ups for those being pushed out .

  is chechneya not a country ? 
  i had always thought it was a country and not a county/area of russia . 
  thanks for the information !, 
  i know very little about this one , can you throw some information at me at why chechens would come over to the eu and be allowed to count as refugees ? 
   `` it 's about 60 % of all refugees , '' timmermans says . 
  `` these are the people for which you can assume that they have no reason to ask for refugee status . '', 
  do we have a real source ? 
  i can find politicians saying lots of things that are patently false . 
  edit : bbc says top 10 countries are not north african . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24636868 russia is up there and i have no idea if that 's ethnic russian or people who have gone to russian/eastern europe while fleeing . 
   i 've never heard anyone saying that only migrants assault women absolutely fair . 
  it just feels like that is the narrative people are throwing around here . 
  the point i was trying to make is that it 's not only the immigrants that are doing this shit . 
  if we are going to say that the immigrants are the problem , we have to admit that germans are the problem as well . 
  acting like the immigrants are special when there was already a problem is a mistake and side-stepping the issue that germany needs to deal with the problem from both germans and immigrants . 
  i 've no problem when people do n't pretend the immigrants are the only one , sadly all of / r/europe feels like it 's only the immigrants fault and white people have done nothing wrong .
