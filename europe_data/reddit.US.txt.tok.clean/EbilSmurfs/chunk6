  no , i mean some people . 
  in this case it includes me but it hardly precludes people to hold a different opinion . 
  had i said all your pedanticity would be more reasonable . 
  and yeah , officers in corporations get types of immunity all the time . 
  whens the last time a ceo went to jail for deciding to push a recall because it was cheaper than the recall ? 
  i seem to remember an airbag issue and an ignition switch issue that no-one went to jail for even though they should both count as murder in more than 1 instance . 
  this is right , the problem is there is n't a better term for what people want at the moment . 
  people do n't like companies , which the employees do n't have say in , to be able to use their money for political purposes . 
  this differs from unions in the fact that unions get to choose their leadership and where they spend money and companies do n't . 
  people dont like the protections that companies get in the sense that you ca n't kill a company or imprision the people running it like you can a person who does the same thing ( like intentional neglegince leading to deaths ) . 
  if you have a better term for what they want i would love to hear it . 
  the majority and minority decision both cited free speech . 
  the minority cited free speech applying only to individuals while the majority made the point that unions and companies were allowed to use their own speech . 
  you will need to cite something else if you want to show i was misstating something . 
  http://reclaimdemocracy.org/who-are-citizens-united/ it 's laid out for you here . 
  sure i simplfied it , but i did n't grossly . 
  straight out it feels like `` freedom of speech '' more means `` rich do what they want '' in the usa . 
  for example companies can spend money and influence us elections legally because they can spend money which we count as using their speech . 
  i 'm not trying to be facetious either , this really does bother me and is a big reason i left the us . 
  one of the arguments i have heard is that `` freedom of speech '' would allow the company to use your data as it sees fit as the company gets to indulge in the same freedoms that the citizens of the country do as well . 
   he burqa is a reflection of a stone-age mentality . 
  you should know the practice started about halfway through the roman empire age . 
  it 's actually more recent than the pyramids are . 
  [ wiki on it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hijab#historical_and_cultural_explanations ), 
  i know , i was being serious though . 
  i have a friend in belgium who went 180 once he had some us bbq sauce and seasonings . 
  honestly , if you have some money and want to try it : http://www.thekansascitybbqstore.com/collections/joes-kansas-city-bar-b-que-merchandise, 
   350 million people , 120 million guns , avg of around 1k police shootings per year uh ... try those numbers again . 
  [ there are roughly 350 million guns in the us as well . 
  ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/05/guns-in-the-united-states-one-for-every-man-woman-and-child-and-then-some/ ) [ apparently about 40 % of us households have guns . 
  ] ( http://www.justfacts.com/guncontrol.asp ) [ with about 1k police killings per year , this number does n't include people shot who do not die . . ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/wp/2015/12/26/2015/12/26/a-year-of-reckoning-police-fatally-shoot-nearly-1000/ ) [ the people shot numbers is something people have been trying to have officially recorded , but even fatal shootings was n't something consistently recorded until now . 
  ] ( https://www.fastcompany.com/3045724/fatal-encounters-crowdsourcing-deaths-by-police ), 
  it 's ok , you do n't know what you are missing and that really helps . 
  one day maybe you will learn . 
  you are using a ridiculous argument : to start ; black people are n't focusing on black on black crime because i guess blacks can only worry about 1 issue at a time ? 
  this is a group that showed up in response to police killing of black people and is focused on that issue . 
  since black people are killed at roughly 3x the number as white people in the us , focusing on that issue seems reasonable for a single group . 
  remember , this is n't every black person in the us ( or sweden as this case may be ) but only a group . 
  i can think of plenty of reasons that fear of police leads to more local/internal policing which leads to more local/internal shootings which would drive that number up as you are discussing . 
  as for sweden , i do n't know enough to weigh in on this groups message here . 
  there is inherent sexism and racism in the system . 
  [ this has been shown in studies . 
  ] ( https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/newsroom/newsn/2700/new-research-proves-gender-bias-extraordinarily-prevalent-in-stem-careers ) it 's more complicated than that , but the base is that women are just automatically undervalued in hiring . 
  [ on top of this , more diverse businesses seem to simply perform better . 
  ] ( http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/166220/business-benefits-gender-diversity.aspx ) [ it 's funny that women get the stem faculty preference though . 
  ] ( https://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2015/04/women-preferred-21-over-men-stem-faculty-positions ) i just want to point out that i sourced columbia college and gallup . 
  these are respectable organizations . 
  since we have clear proof that women are just not hired at a proper pace , it looks like this is the government correcting a private sector failure . 
  much the same reason you are n't allowed to not-hire christians , it seems there is a problem with uneven hiring and they are attempting to fix it . 
  wow , what do you think nationalism is ? 
  when only the good people are in a country ? 
  what the fuck is wrong with you . 
  it is only multiculturalism when the bad is around , not the good ? 
  you are fucked in the head . 
  hahaha . 
  you kids have no idea what you are talking about and it 's adorable . 
  the us is stacked with foreigners , hell my grandfather was n't even born in the usa . 
  even better , germany 's favorite dish ( doener kebab ) is due to turkish multi-culturalism . 
  the uk sure as hell did n't invent curry either . 
  if multiculturalism is so bad , why is the food alone so good ? 
  i responded to someone else who said something similar . 
  in an area with an average household income of 72k ( us average is 52k ) there are 6 murders per 182k people last year . 
  that means a relatively wealthy place in the middle of the country is crushing germany 's numbers in murders . 
  we are n't even using the gunman who walked into a community center and opened fire a few years ago . 
  this is all par for the course where i live , yet i 'm supposed to be worried about germany 's safety instead of mine ? 
  you would think , but even the rich and nice area of my city has 6 murders for 184k people . 
  at least an `` eventful week '' in germany is safer than a week in my current city . 
  where i live has a murder rate of about 17/100k compared to germany 's 0.8 . 
  it 's so strange to realize that while germany deals with a really bad week of `` terrorism '' it 's still safer than just being in my city . 
  you do n't have to believe it , i 'm just pointing out the hypocrisy involved in thinking that cell-phones are a sign of being rich when it 's much cheaper to implement the infrastructure for cell-phones compared to landlines . 
  it 's funny that you use a cellphone as the bar of not being poor when in reality a cellphone is a cheaper option . 
  instead of running hundreds of miles of copper to each house , we run copper to far fewer locations and manage to provide phone service to more people . 
  there is a reason third world countries do n't have home phones but do have cell-phones . 
  to be fair , it 's nice that the refugees are finally doing something that so far has been the realm of belgian and french nationals . 
  ( yes , this is sarcasm ), 
   interesting , you realise of course in this scenario you exchange the tyranny of the majority for the tyranny of the minority . 
  not necessarily . 
  requiring 66 % of votes to make a change instead of 50 % + 1 means a basic tom is being ignored does n't it ? 
  there are reasons to use a larger majority than just over half . 
  we call majorities over a certain amount a super majority and there are reasons for it . 
   she is corrupt , bush was corrupt , trump is corrupt . 
  america is corrupt . 
  that 's fine , the problem is people pretending she 's the only one . 
  i do n't get why ` euros ' are so convinced you need to point out that every us politician is corrupt . 
  is that what you want to hear ? 
  do you walk around saying `` gasoline cars '' or just cars ? 
  when it 's the standard you do n't usually use a specifier . 
  i 'm just going to assume english is n't a well spoken language by most people in this sub , just like it 's not well spoken by most americans . 
  otherwise i am filled with regret that this is the world we live in . 
  next i will have to explain what irony is to you . 
  then think of it this way . 
  you are swedish and your neighbor is swedish . 
  i am saying you are both swedish . 
  that is all i am saying . 
  not that being swedish is good or bad , but that you are swedish . 
  if you want to find someone that is not swedish you need to change either zoning laws ( how elections work ) or go somewhere else ( an other country where the people are n't swedes ) . 
  i have nothing against swedish people , i do n't know any personally . 
  she exactly as acceptable as bush or romney were . 
  i 'm not defending her either , i literally said the entire us system needs to be fixed before we stop getting corrupt politicians . 
  you are reading me saying `` hillary is not special '' and deciding that i like her .
