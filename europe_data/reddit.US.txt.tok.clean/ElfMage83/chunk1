of course . 
  why would n't it be ? 
  true , but i wanted a response from actual europeans . 
  wiki is kinda bland and has a blanket overview , and as i understand it erasmus is a little different in each country . 
  that last part makes me sad , since the drinking age here is too damn high . 
  the point is that we do n't all have guns . 
  you 'd be fine if you came over here . 
  probably . 
  you 're not wrong , but something does n't add up . 
   america has about 350 million guns source ? 
  that 's different from what the article says . 
  in any case , most of those who own multiple ( more than 3 ) guns are far-right republicans who continue to insist that any democratic president ( most recently obama ) will `` take our guns '' ( something that no potus has * ever * done fwiw ) , which would violate our constitution . 
  the whole reason we even have that right in our constitution is that that 's what the british kept doing : taking our guns and telling us we were n't allowed to have them . 
  most americans not in the military or law enforcement have n't ever seen a gun outside of tv , games , and movies . 
  this is what a lot of international visitors forget . 
  thank you for bringing it up . 
   great producers of music , film and technology i live in philadelphia , and i thank you on behalf of all in the city . 
   probably have the nicest national parks of any country in the world lots of space for nature . 
   good food yup . 
  see my first above about music and such . 
   questionable government not all of us like him . 
  [ most of us do n't . 
  ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx )  over the top with guns you guys kept taking them , and we did n't like it . 
   the americans i 've met have been lovely and i 'd love to go there one day . 
  we 're good and decent people in general , despite what the news might say . 
   and i 'm sorry but ` y' all ' makes me cringe . 
  i avoided it above . 
   all those guns floating about [ not that many of us own guns . 
  ] ( https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/22/study-guns-owners-violence/90858752/ ), 
   i suspect ( but have nothing to back this up , so is just my personal guess ) that pineapple chemically interacts with flavors generated by the baking process or with our perception of them , like wine taste is affected by fennel or artichoke . 
  this is correct . 
  fresh pineapple has an enzyme that breaks down protein . 
  when you eat it , it 's eating you back, 
  regarding pineapple on pizza , that was first done in canada . 
  not the us . 
  that 's the way i 've heard most americans pronounce it . 
  thank you !, 
  asking random people in shops about what 's in their carts , or people on the street about such things as weather or politics . 
  small talk . 
  the private insurance industry . 
  we do that in pennsylvania too . 
  it sucks . 
  i just want to go to walmart or some other store that sells both rum * and * coke , for example . 
  ca n't do that here . 
  got ta cross a bridge into new jersey or something like that . 
   i can only speak the most basic conversational german . 
  still more than most americans . 
  i think that 's a huge failure of our patchwork education system . 
   * fuck the old people in everyone 's countries for their political beliefs . 
    * fuck the countryside people in everyone 's countries for their political beliefs . 
    * fuck the religious people in everyone 's countries for their political beliefs . 
  especially the us . 
  they gave us trump , and they 'll swallow anything he feeds them . 
  no , but i did n't vote for him . 
  as a native of the former pennsylvania colony ( and indeed the city of philadelphia ) , i respectfully disagree with your assessment . 
  that link says the drink is toxic . 
  like more so than regular booze . 
  it may have to wait a bit , but that 's an excellent idea . 
  thank you !, 
  blackcurrant is a disease vector for [ white pine blister rust , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_pine_blister_rust ) and that killed a lot of our trees . 
  now it 's up to the states , and most of those affected have reversed the ban . 
   it used to be orange here , and unlike the yellow one in europe ( at least in germany ) that tasted of oranges it tasted of color orange . 
  is there a noticeable difference in flavor ? 
   shokata i do n't know what that is . 
  can you explain ? 
   i have never seen a blue fanta . 
  you do n't mean bitter lemon , do you ? 
  as i said in my op it would probably be raspberry here , and another commenter said it 's blueberry . 
   why would blackcurrant be illegal ? 
  blackcurrant used to be illegal here because it was killing our trees with [ white pine blister rust . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_pine_blister_rust ) since a lot of our trees were important for commercial logging , that was seen as the easiest way to `` fix '' the situation . 
  at this point it 's left to individual states to decide , and most of those affected have reversed the ban and are now allowed to grow blackcurrant . 
  good to know !, 
  thank you !, 
  i know the general history of it , but i did n't know our orange flavor has that color where yours does n't . 
  what does the real orange fanta taste like ? 
  i 've had orangina maybe once in my life . 
  it 's not bad . 
  if i can find almdudler i 'll be sure to try it, 
  interesting symbolism on the label, 
  what flavor does fanta `` exotic '' have ? 
   the us is also the only country in the world to tax citizens living abroad eritrea does that too . 
  [ quora ] ( https://www.quora.com/economic-policy-what-countries-besides-the-u-s-tax-their-non-resident-citizens-on-their-worldwide-income ), 
  chipotle is so much better than taco bell . 
  taco bell is best when you 're drunk/broke/desperate . 
   it 's ridiculously overpriced . 
  last time i ate there i spent $ 12 on a bacon cheeseburger , small order of fries , and a soda . 
   i 'm guessing their prices are higher here than in the usa though . 
  how high is high ? 
  we only have two big parties . 
  republicans ( conservative / `` right '' ) : currently in power , though largely ineffective . 
  supported by people who hated barack obama and wish to destroy his legacy and cut taxes . 
  democrats ( populist/progressive / `` left '' ) : currently the minority party . 
  looking to regain power and influence after huge losses in 2016 . 
  supported by people who voted for hillary clinton and bernie sanders . 
  this party ostensibly wants to restore and expand barack 's legacy by providing basic rights such as universal healthcare and taxpayer-funded tuition-free college , which i personally will believe only when it happens . 
  we have a green party on the far left , and our far-right party is the libertarians . 
  those two do n't get much press . 
   vmro-dpmne : criminals and liars pretending to be conservatives . 
  sounds like our republicans .
