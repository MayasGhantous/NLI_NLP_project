  here in the us employees fill out payroll forms upon hiring , and they receive complimentary forms by the end of the following january to total the taxes paid , rather than employers doing that for us . 
  it 's * very * complicated here . 
  i guess the real gem is that it 's `` football '' because it 's played on foot ( as opposed to on horseback ) as outlined [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/football_ ( word ) ) . 
  ( several weeks ago i ran across a much better link , but this will have to do . ), 
  that can cause fights here too , but probably for different reasons, 
  right . 
  not like most americans ask strangers on the street , but those of us who do ask usually have a vested interest eg significant other or family member . 
  even friends and coworkers ask , but that 's less common . 
  european liberals want to abolish monarchy . 
  that 's what we 'd call `` [ classical liberalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/classical_liberalism ) . '' what we have in the us , and in europe , is `` [ social liberalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_liberalism ) . '', 
  not that that should necessarily be everyone 's business , but is it such a * faux pas * as to come to blows ? 
  welcome !, 
  also , maybe put a portable vpn on a flash drive or something . 
   if you ever cleaned a bathroom you would agree that was my job last summer . 
  not as much fun as i thought it would be . 
  do n't get caught with your pants down !, 
   you should look at your poop at least occasionally . 
  i do . 
  occasionally . 
  why , then ? 
    is it true that german men sit to urinate [ ... ] ? 
    i do , when there is no pissoir . 
  is that such a strange thing to you ? 
  it 's not really strange , but i 'd read that it 's taught you should always sit . 
    is it true that [ ... ] german toilets have shelves so you can inspect feces before flushing ? 
    i find it irritating , too , but it is quite useful when you need a stool sample . 
  perhaps it is !, 
  thank you !, 
  piss-poor attempt at a joke , there, 
  good to know !, 
  i 'd read about a german man who was evicted from his apartment and denied his security deposit after an episode of being drunk enough that he stood up to pee in his apartment bathroom and kinda mostly missed the toilet bowl . 
  i do n't know how true it is , but i figured this would be the best place to ask . 
  thanks very much !, 
  til .

  kinder eggs have always been illegal here , by [ this stupid law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_food%2c_drug%2c_and_cosmetic_act ) passed before they even existed . 
  sounds about right, 
  [ relevant link ] ( http://www.moroccodestination.com/mdm.html ), 
  that 's so broad and flawed i would n't know where to start . 
   the lack of a welfare state and public healthcare means that americans are more likely to behave erratically / `` crazily '' compared to western and central europeans what does this even mean ? 
  \u2022 france : helped us gain independence . 
  true bros. . also , they sold us land that includes new orleans . 
  \u2022 spain : employed the guy who most recently discovered the continent . 
  \u2022 italy/genoa : birthplace of above discoverer . 
  \u2022 morocco : first to recognize our independent sovereignty . 
  \u2022 ireland and germany : a large number of us have some ancestry in these countries . 
  \u2022 uk : started from the bottom , now we 're here . 
  hey now , leave us out . 
  still , bros. 
   in poland when referring to `` the average pole '' the last name used is kowalski . 
  we do that too !, 
  would you say that 's good or bad ? 
   american roads are notoriously long and straight i guess it 's good to be notorious for something relatively innocuous for a change . 
  that said , what did you expect us to do with all this space ? 
   national love of drag racing and nascar mostly in the south . 
  definitely not nationwide . 
  football and baseball are bigger . 
  i ask because i 'm curious , and most answers i get are polite and respectful . 
  definitely informative . 
  i do n't know what you mean . 
  streets have corners here too . 
  right . 
  as long as hillary stays away and trump serves with the twenty-second amendment in place ( and any future amendments which might repeal it are made retroactive ie nobody who served while it was in effect can serve again ) then the electoral college can go to hell . 
  people still do n't get how vastly unpopular they both are , and continue to be . 
  jill got 1 % of votes , and i live in pennsylvania . 
  i did n't vote for hillary because i did n't believe her sincerity , and i did n't vote for trump or gary because i 'm not on the political right . 
  i did n't vote for hillary . 
  i voted for jill stein , our green party candidate . 
  there was much less ill will here toward bernie than you believe , except among politicians . 
  according to everything i 've seen ( not much , since our mainstream media is controlled by the political establishment ) , [ he 's our most popular politician ] ( http://www.rawstory.com/2017/04/bernie-sanders-popularity-continues-to-soar/ ) . 
  eliminating the electoral college is possible , but it would require an amendment to our constitution , and that 's not easy to do . 
  that requires a vote by 2/3 of our congress ( 67 senators and 223 representatives ) even to be proposed , and after that 3/4 of all the states ( currently 38 out of 50 ) must ratify the amendment for it to be adopted and added to the constitution . 
  a better solution would be to eliminate what we call `` gerrymandering , '' which is drawing political districts in a way that favors a certain party . 
  right now the districts are * very * unequal , and in such a way that favors the conservatives who are currently in power . 
  as far as bernie sanders , he 's not the only progressive politician we have , but simply the best known and most popular . 
  we also have tulsi gabbard of hawaii , keith ellison of minnesota , and elizabeth warren of massachusetts and others . 
  many americans ( including me ) see a view opposite to yours , that bernie was cheated and blocked in his efforts to gain the democratic party nomination , with the assistance of such people as [ debbie wasserman-schultz ] ( https://youtu.be/yfwxex7o7-4 ) , [ john podesta ] ( https://youtu.be/vjg7zwc3eos ) , and [ donna brazile ] ( https://youtu.be/irj8jvfrkig ) . 
  it truly made me sad that bernie sanders ' brother larry ( now a politician in the uk ) [ nominated bernie for the democratic party ] ( https://youtu.be/uyytssozmi4 ) and was denied . 
  many of us feel that hillary clinton is extremely out of touch with younger voters , and greedy for money and power , and she 's very hawkish when it comes to war . 
  while she was our secretary of state she gave orders to attack libya , and the situation still today is n't resolved . 
  i say it 's best if she stays away from politics from now on . 
  if you say bernie poisoned hillary 's campaign that 's outright wrong . 
  despite everything thrown in the way of his campaign ( media blackouts , voter suppression , electioneering etc ) , bernie * still * managed to get nearly half the votes needed to gain the party nomination . 
  after everything that happened bernie was , and still is today , concerned about the issues facing americans above all . 
  he wants us to have the same rights to healthcare and education that most ( if not all ) europeans have , and i hope i live to see that done . 
   why ? 
  if it changes before trump leaves , like if the term limits were abolished while he 's in office , he could run as many times as he wants . 
   do you think it might really change ? 
  not if the democrats continue to ignore and resist progressive candidates for elections . 
   i do n't know , it seems to work in the gop 's favor so i do n't see them accepting any kind of change . 
  see above . 
   looks like the dems are the ones always getting screwed with that system . 
  that means * all * americans get screwed . 
  probably yes . 
  i 'd prefer that to be changed * after * he 's done . 
   second round , yeah probably but winning ? 
  very long shot . 
  that 's what they said here about trump nobody expected him to win , least of all trump himself . 
  i 've read that some have compared marine le pen to our own donald trump . 
  i do n't know much about her , but the comparison to `` cheeto benito '' has me worried .
