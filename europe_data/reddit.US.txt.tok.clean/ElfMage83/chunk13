  i 've never had even our version , so i do n't know . 
   crisp [ frankfurter ] ( https://www.bmlfuw.gv.at/.imaging/mte/bmlfuw/contentimageinlinedouble/dam/bmlfuw/land/lebensmittel/trad-lebensmittel/fleisch/fleischprodukte/frankfurter/frankfurter---mit-semmel---ama/jcr:content/frankfurter%20-%20mit%20semmel%20-%20ama.png ) -  [ `` american style hot dogs '' ] ( http://c8.alamy.com/comp/b7h4f6/jar-of-hot-dog-sausages-b7h4f6.jpg ) agreed , but i 'd ** never ** seen hot dogs in a jar before that picture usually they 're packaged in plastic . 
   for question two : peanut butter what 's the question ? 
   sweet sandwiches bother me , so pbj grosses me out as an idea . 
  i feel very strongly that sandwiches should be savory thing only . 
  such sandwiches here are more of a snack , or perhaps for breakfast . 
  most sandwiches eaten for lunch or dinner are indeed savory . 
   i was also slightly disappointed that peanut butter tasted just like peanuts . 
  i do n't know what i was expecting . 
  at least now you know, 
   the one thing i can come up with is people ( not specifically americans ) eating surstr\u00f6mming like they 've never eaten fish before . 
  to be fair , i probably never would have heard of that if not for * bizarre foods america * . 
  that said , i 'd probably ask how to eat it if i ever had a chance . 
  i 'm glad you 're not entirely disappointed, 
  to be clear , i was agreeing with the assertion of `` definitely not swiss . '' i know cheddar cheese was invented in england . 
  thanks !, 
  straight from the source . 
  thanks !, 
  i knew it did n't look right . 
  now it 's fixed . 
  in any case , no haggis in the us ( except from local sources , which i imagine is n't too often done ) . 
  i know it 's italian , but thank you for making it clear . 
  i only meant that it 's easier for non-italian europeans to go to italy than it is for most americans . 
  most of us do n't even have passports . 
   to be clear i think i posted the opposite of what you asked for - this is a danish bastardisation of a burger i also think you did , but i do n't mind !, 
  good to know !, 
  thank you !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  that looks delicious !, 
  we do n't have haggis here . 
  something about bse from cows that makes it illegal to import organ meats from europe . 
  i admit those links go overboard , but if it helps i 'd most likely prepare them as in the recipe you provided . 
  as you said , less is more . 
  which part ? 
  believe it or not , that 's a scottish thing . 
  wikipedia says d\u00f6ner kebab is turkish , but you 're not wrong . 
  i was hungry when i asked , as well as curious . 
  nutella is very good . 
  i like to eat it with peanut butter in a sandwich . 
  i suppose we 're just used to peanut butter here , but nutella is n't as exotic in europe . 
  i have a box in my freezer , still not opened from weeks ago maybe i 'll throw it out soon . 
  you can get gyros with chicken here . 
  i did n't know pork is most common instead of lamb . 
  thank you !, 
  some americans make rolls and bread at home , which are n't as sweet as commercial breads . 
  how are they usually prepared ? 
   would you like for your country to have mandatory military service yes . 
  two years at least . 
   and if so , should it be gender-neutral ? 
  yes . 
  too many rude kids on tv shows like * maury povich * , who could use a dose of discipline like that provided by basic training . 
  it probably also would cut down on gun crimes , and crimes in general . 
  soldiers do n't like to kill . 
  that 's not why . 
  it 's because of the influence of our pharmaceutical industry , private insurance industry , and the military industrial complex . 
  not easy to fix if people keep helping it . 
  besides , if you think that is indeed why we ca n't unfuck ourselves , come over here , become a citizen , vote for someone who will do those things , or , better yet , run for a seat in our congress so you can put it forth yourself . 
  the real-world consequences of the tenth amendment are things like ( extremely stupid imo ) pennsylvania liquor laws , or not being allowed to pump your own gas in oregon and new jersey , or california 's fuel emissions standards for cars . 
  if you suggest granting such powers as you 've mentioned to the federal government rather than the states , it would need a law passed , or another amendment to the constitution . 
  both of those are n't easy to do . 
  [ especially for cursing ] ( https://youtu.be/k1bhuyob8fm ) . 
   in the us i 'd say places like the pnw are the source of standard american dialect with southern states and the northeast ( boston ) representing the more prominent dialects that are n't as intelligible . 
  as i understand it the [ boston accent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boston_accent ) is fairly similar to an english or irish accent ( apologies to both ) , and my own [ philadelphia accent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philadelphia_accent ) is , in my experience , similar to that heard on our news programs . 
  we do n't really have a `` standard american dialect , '' but our newscasters speak in a way called [ general american english ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_american ) , which might be the american equivalent of [ received pronunciation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/received_pronunciation ) in the uk . 
  me too . 
  i 'd expect a question like that to be from a european asking us , as in fact happens . 
  i do n't like it . 
  how did i argue ? 
  strictly speaking , `` argument '' does n't have to mean one party is right and the other is wrong . 
  [ here it is on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argument ) if you 're not sure . 
   `` so i 'm gon na ask a question and then argue with all the responses i do n't like '' . 
  that 's your approach . 
  i looked through the the thread and you argued with plenty of people who did n't mention the second amendment . 
  did i , though ? 
  i have n't told anyone s/he was outright wrong regardless of what a comment said , and in a few cases i learned things too . 
   i just find it counterproductive to ask a question and ignore virtually every response you get . 
  except i do n't . 
  i get notifications on my phone and i go through my inbox as best i can . 
  some comments get answered , and others do n't . 
  such is life . 
  maybe i should have used scare quotes . 
  most of the responses where i `` argue '' or `` dispute it '' as you put it , say something about the second amendment , which i specifically asked be disregarded because i do n't know the answers to questions like `` why do you guys have guns if they 're so dangerous ? '' if you take time enough to assume i disagree with every comment , maybe you should look through the comments to see that i do n't actually disagree in most cases . 
  i 'm not a lawyer nor a constitutional scholar , so i do n't know the ins and outs of everything to do with that , and i do my best to explain what i can . 
  true . 
  that 's what the white house likes to tell us , though . 
  right . 
  i erred in oversimplifying . 
  this is why i asked that comments disregard the second amendment . 
  it 's not something i can explain . 
  we have guns by right , and europe mostly does n't . 
  best i can say . 
  i do n't . 
  different states have different laws . 
  it 's not as cohesive as countries in europe , but it 's what we have . 
  the founding documents of the united states are not things given by god . 
  they were written by and for humans , and i feel treating them as religiously sacred is disrespectful to the spirit in which they were written as well as to actual religions . 
   what is a `` grand jury '' ? 
  [ grand jury ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grand_jury )  what is `` the militia '' ? 
  [ militia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/militia_%28united_states%29 )  how long can a trial take before it is no longer `` speedy ? '', 
  [ speedy trial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speedy_trial_clause )  what is `` excessive '' bail ?
