  i ca n't disagree our conservatives are stubborn ( they 're the ones in power right now ) , and you 're correct that they prefer obstruction to progress , but our next election for congress is n't until 2018 , so we ca n't change it until next year at the earliest . 
  in any case , i still do n't see why you think we should write an entirely new constitution . 
  certain circumstances have changed since the constitution was written , and the amendment process attempts to adapt our laws to those changes . 
    maybe not , but it was vitally important at the time   yes , hence it should be obsolescence . 
  i know that there 's a supreme court ruling stating that the 2nd amendment grants citizens the right to keep firearms for protection of their home for example . 
  but the court was far from united , ruling 5-4 . 
  our supreme court is usually balanced between liberals , moderates , and conservatives . 
  very few scotus rulings are unanimous in any case . 
   any properly functioning government would make sure that the laws are clear enough to be understood . 
  but instead you are pretty much guessing how to interpret a 250 year old paragraph . 
  it 's just madness to me . 
  the supreme court issues rulings on laws and cases based on agreement or conflict with the constitution . 
  is that not similar to your country 's highest courts ? 
    it simply says `` we think these rights are important to us and our people , so let 's write them down so nobody forgets . ''   that would mean your constitution actually do n't grant you any rights at all . 
  so no freedom of speech , no fair trials etc. 
  i did say that . 
  the bill of rights merely protects these rights , holding them as granted by default . 
   i do have a problem with it ( or rather , i would have if i were a us citizen ) , it 's too damn old . 
  most of what 's in the main body of the constitution still applies today . 
  it 's the amendments that change things . 
   we did n't change constitution in 1974 due to war or revolution , we changed it because it was found easier to write a new one than to keep amending the one from 1809 . 
  the us constitution sets the basic laws of the country and federal government , and the main document itself is pretty short . 
  besides that , there have only been 27 ratified amendments in 250 years . 
  not a big number . 
  in any case , we could n't really throw it out and start over , especially now since the party in power could n't even `` repeal and replace '' something as simple as a healthcare measure . 
   the 2nd amendment in particular makes little to no sense in a modern western society . 
  maybe not , but it was vitally important at the time , and in any case i asked in my op that that amendment be specifically ignored . 
  i 'm not yelling at you , but i understand that europeans do n't always agree with that part of our culture and i wanted to limit confusion and debate . 
  besides that , the bill of rights does n't * grant * rights . 
  it simply says `` we think these rights are important to us and our people , so let 's write them down so nobody forgets . '', 
  yes . 
  the [ twenty-first amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twenty-first_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) repealed ( nullified , not removed ) the [ eighteenth amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eighteenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) . 
   after a quick review , i would say amendment six and seven ( trials , prosecution ) seem to be quite important , but of course all of them ( with the exception of the second ) codify very basic rights i asked that the second amendment specifically be ignored for this , but since you brought it up , you should understand that the british government was really into taking our guns and telling us we could n't have them ( something our conservatives fear to this day , which is why they own most of them ) , and we needed to be sure that the new american government would n't continue that policy . 
   some of the amendments seem awfully specific ( like the third , `` quartering of soldiers in peacetime '' ) and have no place in a constitutional document imho that 's on the uk with its [ quartering acts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quartering_acts ) . 
  perhaps it does n't apply anymore , but it 's literally never come up . 
   apart from the second amendment ( for obvious reasons ) just because we * can * own guns does n't mean we all * do * . 
  i do n't , and the laws in pennsylvania specifically limit concealed carry in the city of philadelphia ( where i live ) , as well as transport in a vehicle , to those with permits . 
  that said , i 'm in favor of stronger regulations on guns eg limiting military-grade weapons to active-duty service members , and perhaps also mandatory practice and education before purchase is allowed , as with driving a car . 
   i would feel most enthusiastic about changing the tenth , for the sole reason that i feel more centralization and giving more power to the federal level can you at least wait until * after * trump leaves office ? 
   a single unified police force would be among the first things i 'd propose not that i disagree , but you do realize the us is [ * fucking enormous * ] ( http://mapfight.appspot.com/us-vs-europe/united-states-europe-size-comparison ) as well as having non-contiguous parts , right ? 
  alaska is next to canada , hawaii is halfway across the pacific ocean , and we have several island territories . 
  a unified police force would be impractical . 
  aside from that , the tenth amendment does n't take anything away . 
  it only clarifies that the federal government can do only what the constitution says it can , letting the states set their own laws as long as they do n't conflict with the constitution . 
   ok , i 'll better stop now before i 'm giving op a heart attack . 
   you 're fine !, 
  i appreciate your detailed comment, 
   how does it work ? 
  `` amendment '' can translate to correction/revision as well as addition/extension . 
  more `` revision '' or `` addition '' than `` correction . ''  do you add onto it with every correction ? 
  certain amendments have changed the meaning of the main body of the constitution . 
   eventually leading to a mess nobody can see through or are the laws actually changed ? 
  the twenty-first amendment repealed the eighteenth , if that 's an answer , and several amendments ratified after our civil war dealt with voting rights . 
  amendments change the law at the highest level , affecting all americans . 
   in our system a 2/3 majority of parliament can create laws with constitutional status as well as change old ones . 
  here it 's that 2/3 of the states , or 2/3 of both chambers of our congress , must agree in order for an amendment to be proposed , and ( after it 's proposed ) 3/4 of the states , or conventions in 3/4 of states , must ratify an amendment for it to be adopted and added to the constitution . 
  not easy to do . 
   an important start would be to ** stop venerating that document ** as if it was a holy book that descended from heaven - only then you can start modernizing it . 
  not that it should or must be venerated as holy ( since that would be against the first amendment if nothing else ) , but it 's the supreme law of the united states . 
  speaking for myself , as a not-lawyer with a decent education , while i respect it i do n't hold it as the holy word . 
  in my experience most americans who seem to claim it as gospel from the heavens are conservatives who insists on equating it to the christian bible , and you might recognize this as blasphemy . 
  as for modernizing it , that 's what amendments are supposed to do . 
   my government `` granting rights to me '' simply means that i , through my government , just gave myself a pat on the back . 
  as i said , the bill of rights simply states that certain rights , already granted by whatever power you choose , are protected by law . 
   the distinction just does n't make sense in cultures without an antagonistic view of the government - the very slight nuance between me telling myself that some rights are so important that i do n't intend to ever take them away from myself on the one side , and the idea that those rights are somehow intrinsic and i do n't really need to tell myself that on the other side just seems like philosophical mumbo jumbo without any practical relevance to most people here . 
  it was deemed necessary and important to clarify and codify certain rights as protected . 
  i ca n't disagree with the logic even if i 'd implement it differently . 
  as for `` practical relevance , '' the us was a newly-formed republic , and republicanism was pretty radical and untried at the time compared to most of europe . 
  besides , you 're applying your ethics and sensibilities as a 21st-century dutch person to the situation of late 18th-century america , and there 's a lot that does n't match up . 
   in my opinion free speech , justice , the right to vote and all the rest of it are utterly fundamental to human rights and functioning democracy . 
  i agree . 
   i can see the value of writing that down in american culture , but this question just does n't really translate to my world . 
  as a brand-new country we had to make sure our people knew their rights and freedoms . 
  unfortunately the definition of `` people '' was somewhat more limited back then ( such as in the [ three-fifths compromise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three-fifths_compromise ) and the later [ fourteenth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourteenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) and [ nineteenth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nineteenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) amendments ) , but our constitution was pretty progressive in its time . 
  probably . 
  the fourth amendment is * extremely * important , especially after the recent vote that [ lets isps sell browsing history ] ( https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/28/congress_approves_sale_of_internet_histories/ ) , the [ usa patriot act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usa_patriot_act ) , and [ usa freedom act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usa_freedom_act ) . 
  i view all of this as violating the fourth amendment , but it 's not up to me to change it . 
    also , the bill of rights merely protects these rights , rather than granting them outright . 
    how can you protect something that has n't already been granted ? 
  hell if i know try r/asklegal or r/askhistorians . 
  in all seriousness , the rights protected are * already understood * as granted , as i said in my op . 
   would n't the fact that the constitution protects something automatically mean that the right is in place ( in order to be protected ) ? 
  exactly . 
  the bill of rights just spells it out . 
   but anyway , i have no idea . 
  given the general tone of the document , a reevaluation and modernization would probably do it some good . 
  that 's what amendments are supposed to do . 
  i know a lot of countries throw theirs out and start from scratch , but not us besides , given the current political climate in the us it 's even harder to do things like that than usual . 
  speedy trials are important , oj simpson notwithstanding, 
   well hamilton wrote in one of the later federalist papers ( 80 + i think ) , that a bill of rights is n't needed , because every right not given to the government stays with either the states or the people . 
  then again , he later changed his opinion into a wider interpretation of the federal rights , so his word is n't something to base my decision on . 
  he probably just figured that we 'd know our own rights , realizing later that it 's better to have some of them spelled out . 
   but in a way , he 's still right , constitution should always be interpreted strictly , so no rights that people specifically gave away can not be taken away . 
  but then again 9th and 10th amendment state exactly that ( that was a product of federalists and anti-federalists ) . 
  right . 
  the ninth and tenth amendments are sort of `` cover your ass '' amendments  but all in all , none of the amendments written in the bill of rights is un-needed . 
  it 's more telling which amendments did n't pass , or were n't even discussed , or which amendments were completely changed . 
  the [ twenty-seventh amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twenty-seventh_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) was proposed along with the bill of rights , but it took over 200 years to pass . 
  you 'd think something that gave legislators a pay raise would have passed a lot sooner  there 's no amendment about slaves ( mostly black at that time ) , even though everyone attending both constitutional convention in 1787 and the later state conventions , knew it 's one of the most important and touchy subjects . 
  the closest thing to an amendment regarding slaves was probably the [ three-fifths compromise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three-fifths_compromise ) , at least until after our civil war .
