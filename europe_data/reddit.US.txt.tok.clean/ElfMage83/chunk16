   i guess the problem was that neither north nor south was willing to give in on it . 
  pretty much . 
  thus the civil war . 
   second , there was an amendment to make representation more proportional and more democratic ( or at least that was its intention ) , which still has n't been [ passed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congressional_apportionment_amendment ) . 
  true , and the [ apportionment act of 1911 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apportionment_act_of_1911 ) does n't help . 
   third there was a proposal by the pennsylvanian ( antifederalist ) minority , that way better defined the second amendment , one of the most contested amendments in history , where they defined the right of guns for hunting , and defense in case of war . 
  it might be differently put , because i 'm writing this from memory , but yeah , it would be way more clear than the current one , where there 's so much left out it 's really unclear what it even means . 
  all we knew was that we needed guns . 
  the rest came later . 
  i 'm in favor of stronger regulations on guns . 
   i 'm pretty sure most people here do n't really know that much ( outside of 2nd ) , because it 's not something we 'd really go into detail . 
  i know as much as i do because i literally wrote a master 's degree dealing with us constitution . 
  and no i 'm not just humble-bragging , i just want to make clear that , before i started to study for my masters , i literally did n't know anything else about the bill of rights than i. , ii. , iv. , and parts of v. ( the part where people in movies say `` i plead the fifth '' ) . 
  no worries !, 
  now we both know, 
  now you know, 
  not really . 
  indentured servants technically were under a contract , and slaves served for life unless they were sold or escaped . 
   what 's the difference between the first ten and the other amendments ? 
  the first ten amendments codify our protected rights . 
  other amendments do n't . 
    in suits at common law , where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars , the right of trial by jury shall be preserved , and no fact tried by a jury , shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the united states , than according to the rules of the common law . 
    this sounds weird , specifically the fact that it states a fixed amount ( i assume 20 dollars was a very different value at the time of its writing ) . 
  yeah . 
  $ 20 at that time was worth around $ 1500 today [ per wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_dollar ) . 
  neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the united states , or any place subject to their jurisdiction . 
    this one sounds a little fucked . 
  can you be sentenced to become a slave ? 
  wtf is going on with that exception ? 
  slavery was pretty big in the us until the 1860s , when [ we fought a civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/us_civil_war ) . 
   if i had to choose one i would go for the twenty second . 
  i do n't think it would be wrong for an elected leader to serve more than 8 years if he 's still popular enough to be elected . 
  that 's not part of the bill of rights , but i ca n't disagree with you . 
  as i understand it , most of the push for that amendment came from republicans , who did n't like that franklin roosevelt kept getting reelected . 
  if nothing else , it went against the tradition that ( until then ) no potus had served more than two terms in a row . 
  we were in the middle of a pretty big war at the time , and it would have screwed things up to change commanders ( potus is commander-in-chief of the us military , by law ) . 
  however , if you want to talk popularity , [ grover cleveland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grover_cleveland ) * skipped a full term * and got reelected . 
  that 's unprecedented , and not since repeated . 
  no worries !, 
  calling it `` republican '' is a little simplistic , but it 's not wrong . 
  basically , the gop ( republicans ) in congress like the free healthcare * they * have , and they do n't want their voters to have it too . 
  i see this as a problem , and i 'm not the only one . 
  you said we 're `` totally with odds with some of the perceptions that come out , '' such as healthcare , and you named the people as a whole . 
  in my experience it 's mostly our conservative politicians ( republicans , currently in power ) that resist universal healthcare at this point , and even those who vote for them want universal healthcare . 
  even the current [ majority leader of our senate ] ( https://youtu.be/ywytjg3z_kk ) and the [ speaker of our house of representatives ] ( https://youtu.be/iaqtgz7lcyk ) do n't know what to say when confronted with evidence or suggestions that a single-payer universal healthcare system ( or something like it ) works . 
  these are the men in charge of our legislature , and many believe that , as a certain subset of voters here might say , they 're on the wrong side of history . 
  as far as gun ownership , it 's one of our constitutionally-protected rights , and i personally favor stronger regulations on that . 
  if it were up to me i 'd have it so only our military can possess weapons such as the ar15 , and only while on active duty , as well as demilitarizing our police forces . 
  besides that , i think the root of the problem is the pervasive and persistent influence of corporate money in our political system . 
  however , i 'm glad you 've enjoyed your visits to the us , and i hope you understand that we as a people are n't the soulless greedy uncaring monsters our current government may show us to be . 
  we have an election coming up in 2018 , and our * entire * house of representatives ( lower house ) and 1/3 of our senate ( upper house ) are up for reelection . 
  hopefully we can make congress blue again ( republicans are represented by red , democrats by blue ) and get on track to join y' all in the sun , as it were . 
  fortunately in that case , president trump has proven himself willing to sign almost anything placed on his desk without reading it , but it remains to be seen . 
  to close , i 'll say i 'm not offended , and i 'll simply thank you for your comment and bid you good day, 
  i just had to ask, 
  what do you mean ? 
  i voted according to my conscience . 
  trump is an idiot and hillary is a warmonger . 
  right . 
  unfortunately most of our politicians would be considered moderate in other countries . 
  not really , no . 
  the reason the commercials are so expensive for that game is that so many people watch , and people watch for the once-per-year commercials and the halftime show ( also the occasional `` wardrobe malfunction '' ) . 
  i might have seen * one * commercial for [ godaddy ] ( https://www.godaddy.com/ ) outside the super bowl in my life ( i 'm 34 if that helps ) , but they advertize during the super bowl every year since the internet became a thing . 
  besides that , nfl players make millions of dollars in a year , with each of 32 teams having ~ 53 players , plus coaches and other staff . 
  that ai n't cheap . 
   super bowl with no commercials . 
  silly brits nobody here watches the game itself . 
  you watch the super bowl for the commercials , which cost something like [ $ 10 million * per minute * ] ( http://heavy.com/sports/2017/02/how-much-does-super-bowl-commercial-cost-2017-price-ad-money-expensive-value/ ) . 
  the game itself is played no differently . 
  german : a language so obsessed with compound words that there 's a * game * for that, 
  even better !, 
  thank you !, 
  thank you !, 
  my spanish is poor , but most of that sounds delicious !, 
  except for liver and brains, 
  thank you !, 
   persian food . 
  it 's delicious . 
  a few months ago i went to a persian restaurant and it was the first time i ever ate something middle-eastern . 
  do recommend . 
  persian food is indeed delicious !, 
   and of course rijsttafel , which is always good . 
  that 's a word i do n't know . 
  it 's better to see it prepared . 
  you can see that at [ pat 's ] ( http://patskingofsteaks.com/ ) , [ geno 's ] ( http://www.genosteaks.com/ ) , [ jim 's ] ( http://www.jimssteaks.com/ ) , and [ tony luke 's ] ( http://www.tonylukes.com/ ) . 
  all of those are well-regarded , but my favorite is jim 's ( to be fair , i 've never had from geno 's , but i 've had from the others ) . 
  you can get a comparable cheesesteak at pretty much any pizza shop in philadelphia , but those places i linked are perhaps best known . 
  the meat is brown , and the greenish pieces are the onion . 
  i think you should try it if you come to philadelphia . 
  that looks amazing !, 
  thank you for showing me !, 
  i do n't know * fabada * . 
  what is it ? 
  thank you !, 
  nor here in most cases , but even the constitutionally-protected right to free speech ends at threatening the president of the united states . 
  if you threaten the president or express a desire to harm him that might catch their eye . 
  granted , it does n't happen often , and it probably does n't extend outside the us without some statute of limitations , but i 'm pretty sure your government does n't like its leaders being threatened . 
  be very careful saying such things . 
  the secret service takes its job * very * seriously . 
  i would n't want the cia coming to your door .
