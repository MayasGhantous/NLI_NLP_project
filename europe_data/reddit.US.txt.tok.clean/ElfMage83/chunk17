  most of the guests on the show i mentioned only talk about one item from a specific establishment , but i appreciate your comment in any case . 
  thank you !, 
  thank you . 
  i was n't sure . 
   comparing american bombings to the holocaust definitely ** not ** the same thing . 
   would this be a sustainable and popular approach to trump ? 
  probably neither . 
   taking in black and other minorities for asylum until he 's out of power that would be bad , since they tend to vote for democrats . 
   downgrading relations he might actually understand that ( good ) and respond in kind ( bad ) after throwing a tantrum ( typical ) . 
   if he died unnaturally if he dies , resigns , or is otherwise removed within his term of office , we get president mike pence . 
  i see that as bad in its own way . 
   in 100 years we 'll be seen as cowards i disagree . 
   `` italian hand meme '' explain , please . 
  is that [ this ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3a%2f%2ftse2.mm.bing.net%2fth%3fid%3doip.gdjc2dxijxbbgahipxwicgesco%26pid%3d15.1&amp;f=1 ) ? 
  people who wo n't at least accept the validity of pineapple on pizza are people i do n't need in my life . 
  no matter whose grandmother is cooking , her food is always best, 
   - almost anything with onion , either be fried onion or caramelized onion [ like this cheesesteak with fried onions ? 
  i love a good burger . 
  the best burger i 've had was from a restaurant in new orleans called * port of call * . 
  i did n't even mind the salad in place of fries . 
  thank you for your comment !, 
  that sounds delicious !, 
  thank you !, 
  i ca n't think of a reason it * would n't * be hawaiian pizza , since pigs and pineapples are both popular there . 
  aside from that and `` greek '' pizza ( spinach , black olives , feta cheese ) we mostly call the pizza explicitly by its toppings ( barbecue chicken , four meats , etc ) . 
  right i 'm on the east coast , though . 
  good to know !, 
    there 's a chain shop around philadelphia ( where i live ) which makes the best i 've had . 
    damn !, 
  did n't knew this . 
  i did go for a one-day visit ( for the liberty bell mainly ) while staying on d.c. , would loved it for sure !, 
  i did enjoy ones that i tried on a random restaurant on niagara falls tho . 
  all the locations i found for this chain are away from common tourist areas , but if you come to philadelphia again you should go to [ reading terminal market ] ( http://www.readingterminalmarket.org/ ) . 
  they have many different shops and foods , and you might even find something familiar !, 
  i usually go for the roast pork sandwich at dinic 's or the reuben sandwich at herschel 's . 
  the [ italian market ] ( http://italianmarketphilly.org/ ) is also excellent , though i 'm not there nearly as often . 
  you might find familiar foods there too !, 
  if you have n't tried a real philadelphia cheesesteak , [ pat 's ] ( http://patskingofsteaks.com/ ) and [ geno 's ] ( http://www.genosteaks.com/ ) are good , but my favorite is from [ jim 's ] ( http://www.jimssouthstreet.com/ ) . 
  ( the location in the link is the closest to the liberty bell ) . 
   there 's also another `` version '' alike which is basically an slice or bread , olive oil , garlic and a lil bit of salt !, 
  wikipedia says that 's * pa amb oli * . 
  it sounds delicious in any case !, 
  i can see why !, 
  thank you !, 
  not an option for me , but thank you . 
   japan . 
  every single thing i ate was beyond delicious ( except the fermented soybeans , but you quickly learn to avoid them because they smell like vomit ) . 
  [ * natt\u014d * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natt%c5%8d ) is an acquired taste , which i have n't acquired nor tasted . 
   unfortunately i do n't know the names of half of the things i ate . 
  ( hashtag ) lostintranslation  i should have taken pictures of the menus and ask for translations back home . 
  good advice for next time !, 
   second on the list : greek food . 
  i ca n't for the life of me , cook aubergines that well . 
  keep at it and you 'll get there !, 
  thank you !, 
  nothing wrong with that !, 
  thank you !, 
  thank you !, 
  it 's not so much that there 's a difference , but that languages such as german seem to me , since i 'm american and a native speaker of english , to combine groups of words without spacing in order to describe a single concept . 
  stone carvings in the roman world often had no spacing in text at all , so that 's an example too . 
   a turkish restaurant in my city serves [ i\u00e7li k\u00f6fte ] ( http://cdn.yemek.com/uploads/2016/07/oruk-tarifi.jpg ) . 
  it is heavenly . 
  looks like it !, 
  thank you !, 
   [ your mom . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zxdo4dl7su ) [ not really , no ] ( https://youtu.be/tkdcjjoxeey ) . 
   pizza with chicken , apple and curry . 
  it was pure heaven in pizza form . 
  sounds like it !, 
  thank you !, 
  thank you !, 
   fried chicken with peanut sauce that sounds delicious !, 
  almost like something from the southern us . 
  i have n't had souvlaki in greece , but i 've had it in the us , and i like it . 
  thank you !, 
   fideu\u00e0 that looks delicious !, 
  if you had n't named it i 'd think it was [ jambalaya ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3a%2f%2ftse1.mm.bing.net%2fth%3fid%3doip.wolnkyosyc2moxprp3uj1wesc8%26pid%3d15.1&amp;f=1 ) . 
   buffalo wings a favorite of mine too !, 
  there 's a chain shop around philadelphia ( where i live ) which makes the best i 've had . 
  served with celery , carrots , and creamy salad dressing ( to cool the burn ) and fries ( chips are different here ) , i could eat that at least once a week . 
   pa amb tom\u00e0quet still on my list !, 
  we have that here too !, 
  with ham and pineapple we call that `` hawaiian pizza . '' i like it . 
  [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/vt4dfa4foey ) might agree . 
  right . 
  wikipedia confirms . 
   not sure of this but is n't it because most of an accent is in the vowels , and when you sing the vowel sounds are more open ? 
  that 's what i 've heard . 
  that 's a contraction rather than agglutination , but you 're not wrong . 
  i do n't need to know how you talk to your girl, 
   pay your employees a decent wage and tipping would no longer be needed . 
  some restaurants here follow such a policy , but it 's slow to spread . 
  now that 's just silly, 
   does english really need to be written with separate nouns ? 
  in most cases , yes , as far as i know . 
  maybe it just sounds different depending on which country 's singers you hear most often . 
  eric clapton and adele are english , but they do n't have that accent when they sing . 
  if you did n't know they 're english and you 'd only heard them sing but not speak , you might think they 're american . 
  i had n't seen it on reddit , but i believe you . 
  wow .
