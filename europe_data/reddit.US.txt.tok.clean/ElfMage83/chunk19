  ( not that i was trying to condescend , but i did n't see your uk flair until i opened the thread * mea culpa * ), 
  thank you !, 
  that helps a lot !, 
  i do know how to say that in french , * allons-y * !, 
  like `` all on , see '' in english . 
  if you 've ever seen the uk tv show * doctor who * , the doctor as played by david tennant used that phrase often . 
  [ link ] ( https://youtu.be/3iljfnmaj-k ), 
  very nice !, 
  my russian is almost nonexistent , so i have no idea how to pronounce that, 
  thank you !, 
  some ideas are universal, 
  thank you !, 
  yeah . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 've lived in philly practically my whole life , and i 'd want the capital here regardless of precedent and importance . 
  when i first learned that san francisco was the capital of earth in the various * star trek * series i was left to wonder . 
  true story . 
  thank you !, 
  good stuff !, 
  thank you !, 
  i was directed to [ this link ] ( http://www.inquiry.net/outdoor/skills/b-p/windlass.htm ) from wikipedia , but i understand the meaning . 
  thank you !, 
  thank you !, 
  i do n't doubt it !, 
  thank you !, 
  `` you look like shat out apple porridge '' - meaning `` you do n't look to good , something up ? '', 
  in the us that might be simply `` you look like shit/hell/death warmed over . '' thanks !, 
  sounds good to me !, 
  thanks !, 
  maybe not the * only * other options , but i 'm not disagreeing with your assessment . 
  chicago is still pretty important for finance , and it 's at about the same latitude as nyc . 
  hell , move the capital to somewhere in wyoming for the publicity probably more defensible , too . 
  cellulose can be pretty absorbent , so i guess it makes sense . 
  thanks !, 
  good one !, 
  * ( swedish : `` there must not be we and they . 
  there is just us . 
  '' ) ( not so much an expression , but it is a good quote from palme . ), 
  definitely a good quote . 
  thanks !, 
  very nice !, 
  thank you !, 
  so it 's perfectly fine that bart simpson says it so often on * the simpsons * in the us ? 
  he 's ten years old , after all also , what would he say in the spanish-language dub ? 
  let 's all hope everything goes well . 
  best i can say . 
  i know . 
  just a low mood , i guess . 
  not trying to cause trouble . 
  i deleted my comment . 
  duly noted . 
  comment deleted . 
  exactly . 
  it 's a bit of a pride thing , since most people are proud of where they live or where they grew up and would want to show that ( or , in the case of a random tuvaluan , to show that they actually * have * internet access rather than just being a tld ) , but since people are lazy and screens get cluttered it 's just easier until and unless we achieve a unified planetary government while the internet and the web are still relevant ( unlikely imo ) . 
  that 's why i offered the submenu , like in the case you described it might be `` uk ( gibraltar ) '' or `` uk ( isle of man ) . '' not like these places do n't have their own flags ( if they do ) , but for reddit flair at least it 's less cluttered . 
  i agree . 
  it 's good that the mods are recognizing such places and groups , but unless the flag is of a territory reasonably well known as such ( i 'll use puerto rico as an example ; feel free to swap in your own ) i think the territories of the : : shudders : : ruling country should be under the same flag , with perhaps a submenu once the main country 's flag is selected . 
  same thing with flags like the olympic flag : make a separate category and use a submenu . 
   i 'm american , ca n't set flair . 
  i set mine through the mobile browser on my phone . 
  yeah . 
  the vast majority of my driving experience is in and around philadelphia , so i 'm most familiar with pennsylvania driving laws , but there are a few sweeping generalities . 
  welcome . 
  basically , oc is correct . 
  both are/were rather progressive , and i think that 's important . 
  also , jp2 forgave his assailant , and that 's important too . 
  as for francis , he seems to be a man of science as well as faith , and i appreciate his efforts to reconcile the two . 
  between them and the black population who also fry many foods i 'm not surprised . 
  yup . 
  i 've been in the south more than once , and there 's a lot they do right with food . 
  not much done wrong . 
  fair point . 
  my mistake . 
  that 's not what i said . 
  ny dmv [ confirms ] ( https://dmv.ny.gov/about-dmv/chapter-4-traffic-control-2 ) that you can only legally turn right on red in nyc where a sign allows that . 
  i 'm really not trying to argue . 
  u/theeatinggames is correct , per [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_on_red ) . 
  apparently right-on-red is illegal in nyc ** unless ** there 's a sign that allows it . 
  wikipedia says you can do that anywhere in the us unless there 's a red arrow at the traffic light or a sign indicating `` no turn on red , '' and also that it 's prohibited in nyc unless there 's a sign posted which allows it . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_on_red ), 
  that depends on where you are . 
  you can do that in florida and pennsylvania , though . 
  source : am from pennsylvania , have also driven in florida . 
  [ relevant wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_on_red ), 
   how to build and maintain highways [ borrowed from germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interstate_highway_system ) . 
   no or few potholes [ clearly you have n't been to pennsylvania ] ( http://huffpost.com/us/entry/5317354 ) . 
  in the south , people say everything is better when it 's battered and/or fried . 
  that includes cheesecake . 
  hell , the scottish invented the * deep-fried mars bar * , so it 's not just us . 
  they even [ deep-fry * pizza * ] ( https://youtu.be/uyryxvzwsjg ) in scotland . 
  paula deen fries * everyfuckingthing * . 
  i think she 's even fried sticks of butter . 
  somehow we continue to survive , but i appreciate your sympathy, 
  with as much money as our cities waste for various reasons ( our first lady and her son are [ costing new york a lot for security ] ( http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/08/social-media/does-melania-trumps-security-detail-cost-more-fede/ ) , for example ) i do n't know how well that would work here . 
  besides that many of our cities are both big and spread out . 
  not joking . 
  we do n't really have public toilets in the us . 
  besides that it 's not yet 10pm here , so no april fools . 
  not usually , no . 
  closest thing to it would be going into a shop to ask to use the toilet there . 
  that 's awesome !,
