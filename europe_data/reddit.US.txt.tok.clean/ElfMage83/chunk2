   sdsm : criminals and liars pretending to be liberals . 
  sounds like our democrats , though that 's changing for the better . 
  that 's the one i 've heard . 
  how is it done among belgians ? 
  probably the only thing he 's consistently honest about . 
  definitely not standard . 
  i 'd guess appalachia or the ozarks . 
  mountain folks . 
  how ? 
  i recently learned the correct pronunciation , but this is new to me, 
  mid-atlantic : accent ? 
  what accent ? 
  ( for context , i 'm from philadelphia pa. ) new york : for simplicity i 'll call out brooklyn . 
  very recognizable if you know of bernie sanders or his brother larry . 
  new england : the letter r exists , y' all . 
  use it . 
  southern : like butter on a biscuit . 
  warm and cozy . 
  cajun : draw out the vowels and add a little french lilt to the above , yeah . 
  best accent . 
  minnesota/upper midwest : bastardized canadian . 
  texas : more of a drawl than huckleberry hound . 
  as michael caine said , `` ya got ta make the words lean on each other . '' there are others , but those are easiest for me to identify and describe . 
  i see what you did there, 
  even if he 's not stupid , he 's definitely impaired . 
  he acts like a spoiled rich kid . 
   a sarcastic idiom `` blame obama '' is still used when something goes wrong in russia . 
  we call that `` thanks , obama . ''  there were also some racists ` jokes ' like `` obama is a monkey '' and photos with banana . 
  here too . 
  not funny . 
  technically ? 
  one . 
  in real-world terms , he just strings words together . 
  the man is a walking stream-of-consciousness . 
   bread with olive oil and tomato stealth andorran confirmed . 
   boxer shorts what 's wrong with boxers ? 
  what kind of underwear do you prefer ? 
   baseball caps   it lowers the iq around 99.99 % with certainty unless you 're actually at a baseball game . 
  whether or not this helps , i 've never known a russian who 's not polite , intelligent , and helpful . 
  they must be doing something right if the series has been on for eleven years, 
  not necessarily . 
  the current impossibility or impracticality of long-range space travel does n't necessarily preclude desire . 
  besides , there was a time when the uk claimed 1/4 of all the land on the planet , and now you have trouble keeping your kingdom united . 
  i 'd call at least that last part a problem that needs fixing . 
  my solution would be letting ni rejoin the republic of ireland , and if that emboldens scotland to the point of a final and successful push for independence ( such that there would then be no `` united kingdom '' * per se * ) , then so be it . 
  how are the ravens doing that roost at the tower of london ? 
  fair enough . 
  i remember more then enough from my younger days to know * pommes frites * and * steak frites * , but not every american had a chance to study and learn french . 
  the point is that our politicians are terrible at their job . 
  jane sanders was * allegedly * under investigation for * possible bank fraud * . 
  not the same thing . 
  we 're not even sure what happened . 
  that said , according to google he did spend his honeymoon in the ussr . 
  totally different , though . 
  that 's the problem . 
  our whole spectrum is too far to the right . 
  i 've said more than once that bernie is barely on the left . 
  you 're thinking of the cold war . 
  so are most of our politicians . 
  that 's the problem . 
  they do n't care it 's no longer a thing . 
   ~ ~ i.e. ~ ~ e. g. your first lady is slovenian but no one is saying anything about slovenia ? 
  also apparently we are some poor ex-communist country which forced poor melania to flee . 
  and while slovenia has been more present in american media lately , it is not really talked about as a country ( like john oliver spoke about laibach playing in nk , \u017di\u017eek is invited to some shows and so on ) . 
  we do n't hear much about her since she 's not in the white house . 
  she 's in nyc with her son . 
   but i must say , since we are on the topic , american media is super biased and mean in a very low , unfunny and stereotypical way about russians . 
  i am not a fan of russia but american anti-russian propaganda is just sad and nasty . 
  probably would n't be so bad without all the accusations and allegations of shady shit involving putin . 
  do n't let trump hear you say that . 
  he might have someone read it to him and then he 'll call you out on twitter . 
  i probably never would have known about that if not for [ this guy . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/qif-qz7ny48 ) that said , i 've never played any cs game in my life . 
   bill o'reilly   fox bill got fired from fox several weeks ago , so yay, 
  fyi most of us forget adolf hitler was n't actually german . 
  schwarzenegger too , probably . 
  besides that it 's only mostly tarantino fans who know anything about christoph waltz . 
   the american tv/movie portrayal seems to assume we 're all stuck up effete snobs with bad teeth ( on account of the tea drinking probably ) & an arrogant superiority complex that hosts the occasional urge to take over/destroy the world/galaxy/universe . 
  if we 're not that , we 're skanky aging rock stars with a drug and alcohol problem . 
  is that , then , * not * true ? 
  am from philly . 
  reference unclear . 
   american conditions   horrible conditions i 'd correct you if you were wrong , but you 're not far off from correct,

  let me introduce you to [ the penis game . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penis_game ) [ related link ] ( https://youtu.be/0hrm2bid7g4 ),

  [ august 23 , 2011 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virginia_earthquake ) it was more confusing than anything . 
  i asked myself `` is that an earthquake , '' and just like that it was over . 
  shook the house and rattled the windows , but that 's it . 
  i 'm in philadelphia , and it could have easily been worse . 
  still , it shows why fracking is bad, 
  i got 60 % . 
  i was both impressed and disappointed . 
  that 's about all i can say without comparing . 
  i smell a fail .
