  best we have that i 've seen is [ punkin chunkin ] ( https://youtu.be/-w6gzg7zwgk ) . 
  gun rights . 
  european : tied between ireland and switzerland . 
  non-european : \u2022 esthetically : japan \u2022 generally : us, 
  there are * public toilets * ? 
  i was n't asking about politics . 
  what about americans is so bad ? 
  most of us are pretty chill , and maybe a little wide-eyed if we visit europe and see all the famous architecture and other artwork . 
  that might be most of it , and language barriers do n't help . 
  as for your take on `` have a nice day , '' that might just be your britishness in the way . 
  speaking for myself , unless you cut me off in traffic or turn without signaling , in all likelihood i honestly would wish anyone a good day ( barring burglary and other illegal activities ) . 
  i hope you enjoy your time when you 're here !, 
  you never get old if you 're young at heart seriously , it would be a good and great thing if our baby boomer corporatist politicians retired so the statistically-larger and generally-more-progressive millennial generation can take over and right the ship while she 's still afloat . 
  a * fsck * of the american political system would be very good . 
  file-system check , to correct mistakes . 
  some of us do , but a lot of us do n't like those people . 
  we 're still the rebellious nation we 've been for 250 years, 
  coming from a greek i 'm honored that you 'd say such things . 
  as for a passport , many of us do n't have one . 
  i do , and i 'd like very much to keep it so i might one day fill it with stamps . 
  i understand that , and i would at the very least bring a cellphone or a book of common phrases so i 'd at least have the basics available . 
  thank you for your answer . 
  unfortunately , we 'll never know . 
  what i do know is that a lot of republicans in our congress disagree with the president 's actions , and a * lot * of republican voters are upset with our congress for trying to take away what little healthcare we have . 
  also , a lot of progressive voters here are confused and frustrated at hillary 's sudden reemergence into the public eye . 
  speaking just for myself , i want her to stay home . 
  i 'm not with her . 
  i did n't mean to suggest the dnc should have handed bernie the nomination if hillary got more votes , but i feel she was too focused on winning to see any possibility of loss ( as in fact happened ) , and i think she should have given it to him , as she did barack obama . 
  i do n't hold barack blameless , but i do n't like hillary 's attitude or personality . 
  bernie is an independent member of our congress , and he only ran as a democrat so he 'd have a chance of winning . 
  i 'd much rather have someone like tulsi gabbard , keith ellison , or elizabeth warren running for the democratic nomination in 2020 than hillary clinton again , if bernie ca n't or wo n't run . 
  none of them is quite as progressive as bernie sanders , but they 're all close , and the important thing is that they 're already in the democratic party . 
  any combination of that would be historic : tulsi gabbard is a hindu woman , keith ellison is * actually * a muslim , and elizabeth warren is a woman with native american ancestry . 
  in any case , we 'll see what happens . 
  i had n't known that . 
  thank you !, 
  i 'm glad you enjoy our arts , music , and food , and especially that you enjoy thanksgiving and halloween . 
  speaking just for myself , i refer to people from latin america as `` hispanic , '' since that 's what i understand the race to be . 
  i apologize for accidental offense . 
  that 's the most i can say both truthfully and certainly . 
   coming here and asking how you can be more like them i do n't know how i 'm doing that . 
  i just asked what europeans think about us . 
  not like r/askanamerican does n't get similar questions from redditors outside the us . 
  i know , but it 's good to get outside opinions . 
  that 's how we improve . 
  how am i being a masochist , though ? 
  thank you !, 
  one day i 'll visit austria to see for myself !, 
  i 'm using reddit is fun gp on an android phone . 
  thanks for clearing that up !, 
  cheap , processed food available almost everywhere at almost any time tends to do that , and our necessary driving culture does n't help . 
  i can see your flair , but i do n't know what `` eastway '' is . 
  thank you . 
  which country is it , please ? 
  yes . 
  i had no idea , and for what it 's worth i 'm sorry, 
  i wonder what americans in general would think of r/scottishpeopletwitter . 
  i find it hilarious, 
  i think a lot of that has to do with `` american exceptionalism , '' the idea that the us is the greatest country ever . 
  we used to be kind of okay , but not great . 
  i blame [ reaganomics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supply-side_economics ) . 
  a lot of americans think we 're `` great '' because we have many rights and freedoms explicitly laid out in our constitution , but individual rights and freedoms do n't necessarily extend `` greatness '' to a country . 
  personally , i think an integral step toward * actual * greatness would be getting corporate money out of our political system , so that we could have leaders and lawmakers who care about people over profit . 
  i 'm also in favor of stronger regulations for firearms . 
  nobody who 's not currently serving in our military should have access to that kind of weaponry , and those who are serving should return their weapons on leave or retirement . 
  something like the swiss system would greatly benefit the us . 
  they have even more guns per citizen than we do , if i 'm right , but in any case their rates of gum crime are very much lower . 
  i 'm also strongly against the militarization of our municipal police . 
  police do n't need tanks , especially if the other side has [ rocks and sticks at best ] ( http://m.huffingtonpost.com/jamil-dakwar/police-at-standing-rock-a_b_13172344.html ) . 
  she won the popular vote , but in this case that did n't matter . 
  the us uses an [ electoral college ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_college_%28united_states%29 ) , and more members of that group voted for donald trump than hillary clinton . 
  the mistake was on the democratic party for allowing hillary to be nominated despite her [ historically high unfavorability numbers ] ( https://theduran.com/new-poll-hillary-clintons-favorability-ratings-sink-to-an-all-time-low-of-35/ ) and polls showing that [ bernie sanders would have won ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/bernie-sanders-beaten-donald-trump-pre-election-poll-a7412636.html ) . 
  bernie was * much * more popular even if he did n't always hit every target at his rallies , and i just hope we 'll have another chance to vote for him in 2020 . 
   very friendly people usually . 
   loud some of us , yeah . 
   over-the-top , ultra-capitalist/materialist eg trump  cowboys eg george w bush  uncultured see `` trump '' above  unfair stereotyping i know but that 's what stereotypes are . 
  not entirely undeserved . 
  i 'm glad he 's done good for spain, 
  thank you for your input, 
  i 'd still like to visit, 
   americans and america have never been held in high esteem , and recent developments have not improved that . 
  if it helps , and in any case , i voted for neither hillary nor trump . 
   american society is viewed as highly individualist , which is an ideology that is not that popular in germany . 
  that might have a lot to do with our current focus on corporate capitalism . 
  i 'm not a fan of that . 
   irrespectful disrespectful . 
  also , i appreciate your honesty . 
   of us 's governament ? 
  pretty bad , no matter if republicans or democrats are in charge agreed . 
  been that way for a while now . 
  i enjoy learning , and i enjoy language . 
  i do n't know how well i 'd do with czech , but i 'd give it a try if for no other reason than to assimilate , as well as fighting the stereotype of the ignorant , careless american . 
  do you agree with that textbook despite using a different book when you were learning ? 
  understood . 
  thanks !, 
   americans * still * make nazi jokes towards germans and think they 're funny * some * americans do . 
  those are people we both do n't like . 
  i 'm glad !, 
  thank you for letting me know . 
  specifically to remark on point # 2 , if i were ever visiting or living in a country where most people do n't or wo n't speak english i 'd at least make an effort to learn the language if not the local dialect .
