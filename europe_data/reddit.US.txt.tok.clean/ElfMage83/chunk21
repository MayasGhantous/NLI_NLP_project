  maybe i 'm an outlier . 
   which there 's a stereotype of for a reason we have that here too , especially for drivers . 
  my dad told me when i started driving that `` everyone else is an asshole . '' there are days i feel like the only driver who 's not . 
  yeah . 
  maybe one day we 'll have a single planetary government like in * star trek * , though hopefully without the `` post-atomic horror . '', 
  i 'm out of spanish , but thanks !, 
  well , yeah . 
  you ca n't call the movie one thing and give the thing that named the movie a different name . 
  indeed . 
  in any case , the movie was based on the book , so it makes the most sense to change the title for both if one is changed . 
  ca n't have been fun to double-film the scenes in that movie when the stone is named . 
  is n't that what we were discussing ? 
  wikipedia says that the us publisher figured american kids would n't want to read a book with the word `` philosopher '' in the title , and that jkr suggested the change herself . 
  i guess since she 'd been a teacher she 'd heard how bad our public schools are . 
  i 'm not saying you 're wrong , because you 're not , but it makes me sad that they changed the title no matter why . 
  right . 
  i did n't say that . 
   are citizens randomly selected to serve as jurors ? 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/jury-service/learn-about-jury-service ) . 
   if you were selected , would you want to go ? 
  i 've been lucky enough so far to claim hardship each time , but i still would n't want to serve . 
  this almost goes without saying , but our juror pay rates are also [ pretty low ] ( http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/jury-service/juror-pay ) . 
   philosopher 's stone * sorcerer 's stone * ( i 'm just playing around . 
  i know the original title is correct , and i wish the us publisher had more faith in our kids than in our schools . ), 
   faulty towers * fawlty towers * . 
  i blame your auto-correct . 
  [ * gone with the wind * ] ( http://imdb.com/title/tt0031381/ ), 
  you ca n't spell `` anzac '' without america . 
  would it work once we get a real president , in the mold of bernie sanders ? 
  all cars sold in the us after 1996 have automatic daytime-running lights . 
  better to see and be seen , i suppose . 
  what is meant by `` deficient ? '' i have an idea , but the definition in this law might be different . 
  yup . 
  possibly , but he 's ours , and we 're not letting him leave . 
  even if he did [ spend his honeymoon in the ussr ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-02-11/how-bernie-sanders-spent-his-soviet-honeymoon ) . 
  i did notice that . 
  however , i feel you very quickly redirected your answer to discuss other politicians . 
  i did n't ask for a comparison . 
  i asked for a simple yes-or-no answer , and you went far beyond that . 
  he was . 
  he needs to work on that . 
  i do n't know much about what russia needs , but i agree he 's what the us needs . 
  he ran as an `` anti-establishment '' candidate because he 's politically independent . 
  he only ran as a democrat so he 'd have a chance of winning . 
  after he lost the nomination he regained his independent status . 
  your assertion that it 's `` ridiculous '' because he 's `` been in politics 45 + years '' is inaccurate at least . 
  he was elected mayor of burlington vt in 1981 , then to the house in 1990 , and the senate in 2006 . 
  at this point that 's less than 40 years total , and i 'd imagine most people outside vermont had n't heard of him until recently . 
  in all that time he 's been consistent in pushing for stronger social programs for americans , and he 's written more amendments to bills made law than any other member of our congress . 
  hillary * is * `` a [ corrupt right-wing hawk ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/magazine/how-hillary-clinton-became-a-hawk.html ) . '' a * lot * of americans dislike her attitude in favor of war , as much as her disdain for the average american . 
  she 's out of touch with us , and she tries too hard . 
  as far as your assessment that bernie `` basically checked out , '' i think a lot of that has to do with his status as an independent senator , not tied to any political party here . 
  he knew the democrats would n't listen to him , because of his resistance to their [ strong corporate ties ] ( http://www.realclearpolitics.com/2014/01/24/how_corporatists_took_over_democratic_party_324327.html ) , and i believe those ties are also a strong reason he was denied the democratic nomination despite [ drawing huge crowds at his rallies ] ( http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bernie-sanders-draws-biggest-crowd-any-2016-candidate-yet ) . 
  he said a lot that appeals to a majority of americans , [ even trump supporters ] ( http://www.nationofchange.org/2017/03/15/bernie-sanders-cheered-trump-supporters-declaring-healthcare-right/ ) . 
  as for being a `` gun nut , '' that 's just how we do . 
  vermont is strongly pro-gun , and it 's something americans are just used to . 
  i 'm i 'm favor of stronger regulations , for what that 's worth . 
  i was talking socially as well as economically , but i agree in any case . 
  i 'm not saying europe is as far left now as before , because i honestly do n't know , but i do know we in the us need better social programs and more politicians willing to push for them and see them done well . 
  i also think we need less of a presence in other countries and waters . 
  when y' all are n't laughing at our politics and policies you 're grumbling about how we 're forcing our ways on you one way or another . 
  all of that makes me sad . 
  i 'm not saying we should close ourselves off , since that would affect the rest of the planet in a pretty big way , but it should be more cooperation and less coercion and intimidation . 
  definitely less bombs , at least . 
  tiger woods is n't an athlete here either . 
  i do n't deny he 's good at what he does , but he 's not an athlete . 
  to your point about commercialized sports here , it 's probably that . 
  nobody has figured out a way to make money showing sports like gymnastics or curling , so it 's done for love of the game unless you 're bruce jenner ( i 'm only bringing that up because that was before the operations . 
  caitlyn won the medals as bruce ) or michael phelps . 
   it is not now `` largely ignored . ''  it was never a thing outside the northeast and bordering parts of canada . 
  that kinda says it is . 
  sure , there are more americans in that area than in half of the rest of the us , but you 're right . 
  i do n't dispute how fast it 's growing , but it 'll take a while to get anywhere near as big as our `` big '' sports . 
  that 's all it is . 
  i guess that 's what happens in a mashed-up mongrel language like english , especially with no central authority to set common standards like with french or spanish . 
  as an american i perceive the british to be wrong in speaking english when they use words that make no sense to me , but they perceive us to be wrong too . 
  it 's all fucked . 
  right . 
  it does n't help that most americans forget other sports than our `` big four '' even exist outside of world cup and olympic years . 
  hell , most of us do n't even care about association football even though probably 80 % of american millennials played it growing up , and lacrosse was pretty much invented by native americans yet is now largely ignored outside the area between philadelphia and baltimore . 
  that was a dick move on obama 's part . 
  as for my point , did you check the link ? 
  \u2022 best so far : washington , lincoln , f. roosevelt , eisenhower , l. johnson , or obama . 
  \u2022 worst so far : buchanan or trump . 
  ( i say that with a twinge of shame since james buchanan is the only potus so far from pennsylvania , and i 'm from that state . ), 
  you do know that obamacare was based on a republican plan , right ? 
  [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/affordable_care_act ), 
  should the us dictate what 's wrong and right ? 
  we ca n't even figure that out for ourselves , and in any case it 's not our place to force our beliefs on anyone else . 
  bernie sanders and the democrats can do little right now because the republicans are in power , but our next election for legislature is in 2018 and that can change if the democrats would swallow their pride and allow progressives to run unhindered . 
  that 's what got us where we are now . 
  as for warren in 2020 , i think that could work , especially if she ran with tulsi gabbard or keith ellison as vice president . 
  either of those would be historic , since tulsi is a woman , a hindu , and a hawaiian , and keith ellison is a muslim , and all are rather progressive for american politicians . 
  it 's probably because of the tenth amendment . 
  states can do pretty much whatever they want as long as it does n't go against the constitution , and the federal government ca n't stop them . 
  there 's a will , but it 's largely silenced for now by both major parties . 
  our conservatives are in power now , and the minority in opposition ignores progressives . 
  this is a problem . 
   some form of healthcare system like we have in europe , where nobody has to worry about having enough money or not for a broken leg and people can move forward because they do n't have to pay medical bills for years . 
  how then would our insurance industry make money ?
