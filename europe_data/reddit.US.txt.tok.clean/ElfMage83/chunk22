  ( for the record i agree ** completely ** , and i wish bernie sanders had won . 
  he 's the best we have . ), 
   also , it would n't hurt to tune down a notch the entire `` we are the leaders of the free world '' . 
  we 're not all like that . 
  i know i 'm not . 
  that 's why we have the amendment process . 
  hell , we even had [ an amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twenty-first_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) that repealed [ another amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eighteenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) . 
  what would you suggest ? 
  our constitution is the supreme law in the us . 
   perceive yourself as one country out of many , and realize that not everybody is striving to `` reach '' where the us are . 
  some of us do . 
  i know i do . 
   get a better banking system , then get rid of credit cards . 
  i 'm talking about free , next-day online wire transfer , automatic deductions and getting rid of cheques and signing when paying by card ( use pin instead ) . 
  we just got chips in our cards * last year * . 
  give us a little while to get used to that , at least . 
   have price tags include all taxes . 
  and no , differing taxes between states/cities does not count as an excuse - if a store/branch can stock its racks , it can also print and apply the correct price tag ; or even better , it can use electronic tags . 
  this assumes americans enjoy doing arithmetic . 
  we do n't . 
  because we * do * have different taxes for different states , counties , cities , and circumstances due to the [ tenth amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) , it 's easier to add the tax at the register . 
   get fully tax-funded healthcare and education systems . 
  up to and including university level . 
  after what happened yesterday , universal healthcare is the only real way forward . 
  actually * doing it * would take a guy like bernie sanders , as sad as that sounds . 
  same thing with education . 
   less energy wasting , more green energy . 
  you underestimate how much we need air conditioning in certain areas . 
  i 've been in the gulf coast , and it 's * extremely humid * in the summer . 
  even in autumn in some places . 
   get a public transportation system , improve situation for pedestrians ( in some areas ) . 
  pavements , people !, 
  and a modern and fast train system . 
  you do understand the us is * fucking enormous * , right ? 
  having trains criss-crossing the us would be a logistical nightmare . 
  you might not have to wait that long . 
  the conservative party now in power keeps failing , and the opposition has no clear message . 
   the slaver ... 
  i mean prison system should totally get reworked in the image of most western european ones . 
  `` incarceration over rehabilitation . '' it totally sucks . 
   also , basic healthcare for everyone . 
  this is the obvious one but probably the most important and life changing . 
  exactly why our conservatives do n't want it . 
   tuition free , or at least reduced , college education . 
  how will they control us if we 're not burdened with crushing student debts ? 
  my country 's english accent is now an american accent . 
   your vowels are all wrong and stupid how so ? 
  can you explain the difference ? 
  here it only needs to be ratified by 3/4 of the states ( 38/50 for now ) . 
  that 's it . 
  you 're right that it 's not set in stone , but it 's really difficult to get an agreement from that many states . 
  yeah . 
  dude needs to stay home and learn the job . 
  maybe try some light cardio , resistance training , and eating salads to balance out all the fast food he eats . 
  some states do something like that , but others do n't . 
  that 's the problem with state sovereignty . 
  we ca n't really have a single national id card , because every state sets its own laws . 
  passing a federal law to require a national voter id might conflict with our constitution , because of the [ tenth amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) . 
  here in pennsylvania there 's no requirement for a voter id as such , but we have registration cards mailed to our addresses . 
  when we arrive at the polling place , we verify our address and sign the roll book . 
  another answer to the question `` how stupid is he ? '' he 's cutting programs and departments that cost next to nothing , but which are important for other reasons . 
  that assumes trump will only get one term . 
  i 've been reading he might get two , with how our democrats are ignoring progressives , but at least he ca n't get more than two terms . 
  i think so too . 
  maybe he 'll run again in 2020 , or tulsi or ellison . 
  it 's a shame sam ronan could n't even be vp , since he 'll still be too young . 
  he said he 'd like to work with tulsi , though , and that 's a start . 
  i know we 're not . 
  i know that all our rights and freedoms do n't mean we 're the best . 
  besides that , such a mindset is more common among conservatives here , and that 's not all of us . 
  not to make light of it , but there was a throwaway line in an episode of one of the * star trek * tv series about `` the irish reunification of 2024 . '' maybe we 're a few years early . 
  as i said , most voters in that case voted simply because of the vote . 
  scotland is considering a secondary referendum on that result , because most in scotland voted to remain , not to leave . 
  same with wales , if i 'm right . 
  i agree . 
  however , no government is perfect , and i admit that ours is deeply flawed . 
  as far as the will of the people gone unheard , another example of that is the brexit vote . 
  from what i 've read and heard , many in the uk voted simply because there was a vote , without considering the consequences . 
  i do n't have an answer to that . 
  i do know that it happens a * lot * here , that bills fail to pass the senate after passing through the house . 
  sometimes that 's good , and other times it 's bad . 
  if we can get some combination , at the federal level , of legal marijuana , taxpayer-funded tuition-free college , and taxpayer-funded universal healthcare it 's a good start . 
  i agree with all of that . 
  all i can do for now is vote and keep up with the situation . 
  if it passes the house , which represents the people , then it 's up to the states once it gets to the senate . 
  as i 've said , every state is equally represented in the senate . 
  i suppose it does , but i 'm not sure what you mean by `` minor states . '' do you mean states with small populations , or states represented by the minority democrats ? 
  the distinction is important . 
  the republican party is in power here after the recent election , at all levels , and the democratic party is the minority/opposition party . 
  the problem with that is that 6 corporations control something like 90 % of media in the us . 
  i agree that people must have the option of in-depth and unbiased news , but that 's easier said than done . 
  in any case , there would probably need to be a vote , and that ca n't happen on a whim . 
  the senate represents the states , and the house represents the people . 
  no state has more power in the senate than any other . 
  the power shift is in the house of representatives , where the representative districts are supposedly based on population . 
  this is why states such as wyoming and delaware have only one representative in the house , but each has two senators . 
  how do we define `` better ? '' what makes a parliamentary government like the uk or germany better than a federal republic like the us ? 
  all i meant was that we 've had a federal republican government from the beginning , and we ca n't just change it all at once . 
  that 's not my call , and , as i said , we fought a war because we wanted it a different way . 
  after 250 years we could n't just up and change it .
