  gary johnson and jill stein * put together * got less than 5 % of votes , so any argument about the `` spoiler effect '' is invalid . 
  you said i 'm part of the problem , but the bigger problem is that almost half of us * did n't vote at all * , for whatever reason . 
  i did n't like what she was saying , i did n't like what she did , and i would n't believe she 'd do what she said until and unless it happened . 
  i did n't trust her , and i still do n't . 
  she said almost nothing on policy in any of her ads , and that 's another fact we can both look up if you 're not sure . 
  bernie ran clean , trump ran aggressive , and hillary ran blind . 
  i think the first idea would need its own amendment , and the second might too . 
  gerrymandering totally sucks , and we 'd need to start from scratch and rebuild to make it work . 
  you 're probably right . 
  we 're on our way down , and it 's going to get worse before it gets better . 
  a lot of states and lower jurisdictions simply do n't use paper ballots and boxes anymore , and i do n't know why . 
  i do n't hold barack blameless , but there 's nothing he can do now . 
  as i 've said more than once , the problem is money in politics . 
  we need to fix that first . 
  the problem with that is money in politics . 
  once that 's gone we can fix the rest . 
  not that that would n't work , but we 'd have to vote on it first . 
  i do n't have the luxury of looking at the us from the outside . 
  i know we 're fucked , and there 's not a goddamn thing i or any other american can do to fix this except vote , and even if i had voted for hillary , the fact remains that , * according to the rules * , she lost . 
  they 're both power-hungry , narcissistic egomaniacs , and i could n't vote for either of them . 
  i voted for bernie sanders in the primary election , and i voted for the green party nominee after that . 
  you 're asking me to get sources , and those sources are all over the internet . 
  if your english is good enough to bitch me out for having a conscience and following it , then it 's good enough to do your own homework on this . 
  same as i did . 
  everything i saw , heard , and read told me that hillary clinton is a terrible person and a terrible political candidate . 
  as bad as trump is , hillary proved years ago that she 's * even worse * . 
  libya , afghanistan , syria , and half the rest of the planet are in varying states of ruin because of what hillary clinton allowed as our secretary of state . 
  when the election came around last year , i read that hillary would n't even listen to bill clinton , her husband besides being a former president on his own , someone who * already had the job * and knew how to run a campaign as much as running a country . 
  a key part of any executive position is * listening to your team * , and she ca n't even do that . 
  i 'm aware that everything has consequences , and the best thing for the us is for hillary clinton to go away and never come back . 
  she 's indescribably worse than donald trump , because she knows * exactly * which buttons to push , while at least now the republicans in congress are n't passing anything major for trump to sign , besides their own infighting in both houses of congress over healthcare , which is the biggest clusterfuck of all now that americans actually * know * that the aca is the * same fuckin ' thing * as `` obamacare '' and it might all be going away . 
  i hate this , and i wish i could do more to change it , but at least i voted , unlike the 46 % of americans who were so sick of all the bullshit that they did n't even bother . 
  that 's too simple to work here . 
  you underestimate the resistance of the american voter . 
  even assuming every state does indeed want that , we 'd still have to wait until 2018 . 
  polling stations here are open from 8am to 8pm . 
  as far as more polling stations , a lot of the suppression was done in areas where most voters would have voted for bernie sanders . 
  bernie sanders is from brooklyn , and * 120,000 * names in that county alone were stripped from the voter rolls . 
  besides that , polling stations are assigned by address , so we ca n't go to just whichever one is handy . 
  if she 's competent and honest , why could n't she step down and let bernie be the nominee ? 
  polls then and even now say he was the stronger candidate . 
  she let her arrogance doom us to at least four years of a fascist as our chief executive . 
  i do n't see them moving left either . 
  that 's why they need to gtfo . 
  i agree with you on everything else . 
  how would we all vote without machines ? 
  not every state has the option to mail in a ballot . 
  when i vote in pennsylvania i have to go in person to a polling location . 
  no mail-in voting here . 
  working on it . 
  the decision that allowed that was [ * citizens united * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizens_united_v._fec ) . 
  reversing that would get money out of politics . 
  i do n't know that a parliament would work from a legal perspective , since our constitution pretty clearly describes and outlines a bicameral congress . 
  as far as political parties , our founding fathers did n't want them at all , and in any case that would take a * lot * to change . 
  that said , i agree we need more than two parties , but we need to get money out of politics first . 
  do n't i know it . 
  i had no problem here in pennsylvania , but i heard about the shenanigans in new york and nevada . 
  we 're trying to do those things . 
  as for the senate , each state has only two senators . 
  that 's the balance . 
  the number of representatives is different for each state , but each state has at least one representative to the house . 
  as i understand it , the senators represent the interests of the separate states , and the members of the house represent the interests of the * people * in those states , with the number of representatives depending on population , and by law each state has at least one representative . 
  however , with the planned repeal of the affordable care act , the republican majority in both houses of congress may be in danger of losing that majority in 2018 and later . 
  i see this as a good thing , since i 'm a progressive and a former democrat . 
  yup . 
  our politicians lately refuse to acknowledge the social aspect of democracy , and i see this as a serious problem . 
  bernie is the biggest voice progressives have in us politics , and he 's not getting any younger . 
  that 's a good start !, 
  i agree with getting rid of the electoral college at this point , since that 's what got us cheeto benito , but that still leaves the possibility of president hillary clinton , and i do n't want that either . 
  frankly , at this point i prefer trump to clinton . 
  let trump be seen as a failure first , ** then ** maybe we 'll get some honest , * actually-progressive * democrats in 2018 and beyond to replace the money-hungry corporatists we have now , so the democrats can regain power and earn back respect . 
  the democrats say they 're on the left , but they 're in the center . 
  bernie sanders is as far on the left as we 've ever had , and he 's barely on the left . 
  both parties are collapsing . 
  i hope the 2018 election will bring a viable replacement for our democrats to oppose the republicans in 2020 , and that both bernie sanders and donald trump are around for a real cycle . 
  otherwise we 're * all * fucked . 
  we only have two major parties , and at this point they 're both terrible . 
  democrats have no strategy to regain power , and republicans want to take what little healthcare we have . 
  anything besides democrats or republicans , then . 
  you . 
  i like you . 
  have an upvote . 
  in the us , any party must have at least 15 % of the vote in the primary election to be eligible for the debates . 
  the problem with that is the `` commission '' which decides that is operated jointly by the two major parties ( non-conservative democrats on the `` left '' and conservative republicans on the `` right '' ) . 
  since they do n't want anyone else to win , we 're stuck with those two as our biggest choices . 
  i quoted the words `` left '' and `` right '' for clarity , but both parties are actually more toward the center , and i first avoided describing democrats as `` liberal '' to limit confusion since that word has a different political connotation in europe from in the us . 
  here we use `` liberal '' as the opposite of `` conservative , '' but lately it 's become something of an insult . 
  basically , our democrats push for expanded social welfare , and republicans wish for the opposite , a limited national government . 
  i would n't spread either of those on a sandwich . 
  thanks !, 
  `` cheeto benito '' made me laugh despite my feeling of impending doom and dread . 
  thanks !, 
  that sounds tasty , and i do n't like pickles on sandwiches, 
  organizations such as the [ justice democrats ] ( https://justicedemocrats.com/ ) and [ brand new congress ] ( https://brandnewcongress.org/ ) are gaining support , and i see that as a good thing . 
  those movements are geared toward electing members to our congress and other levels who would fight for the american people rather than corporations . 
  besides that , more and more republicans in congress are [ facing angry constituents ] ( https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=-2ymsezw-i4 ) who do n't want the affordable care act taken away . 
  the republicans are the party in power right now , and many of them are [ literally running away ] ( https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=m-0x5_b2f4s ) from holding town hall meetings . 
  unfortunately , our next election is in 2018 , but if it 's this tough now it 'll probably be easier for democrats to regain a majority in congress . 
  i do n't see that as [ likely ] ( https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=81urqsl9dn0 ) , though . 
  such is the irony .
