  we think we 're free because our rights are literally spelled out , but in practice it 's the opposite . 
  too much corporate control in our politics , which leads to less * actual * freedom and more unconscious ( at least unwilling ) servitude to some shadowy menace . 
  we 're finally starting to fight back , and it 's slowly working . 
  fair point . 
  freedom ai n't free . 
  true : \u2022 lots of obese people . 
  ( sadly ) \u2022 non-immigrants usually only speak english . 
  ( even more sadly ) false : \u2022 lots of rude people . 
  ( except as drivers ) \u2022 everything here is fried . 
  ( we also have barbecue ), 
   land of the free stuff . 
  except healthcare and education . 
  that should be enough to prove we 're not even equal , let alone superior . 
  for the record , i believe we 're not superior . 
  simply different . 
  good to know !, 
  thank you !, 
  yup . 
  i 've seen kerrygold butter in stores and on tv and it 's a lot yellower than here . 
  no it does n't . 
  the human body already produces all the cholesterol it needs on its own . 
  since this is true , the problem is * extra * cholesterol found in foods . 
  fats and oils contain cholesterol , but they do not produce it . 
  all fats have a lot of calories . 
  that 's how fats work . 
  clarified butter is a little healthier than regular butter because you can use less of it . 
  butter also does n't * produce * cholesterol , it * contains * cholesterol . 
  also , butter has less fat than olive oil . 
  as i said , each has its place . 
  butter is n't really unhealthy , especially if you [ clarify it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clarified_butter ) . 
  that said , each has its place . 
  i do n't normally eat tomatoes that way , but that sounds delicious !, 
  thank you for sharing !, 
  maybe the sweetness is a reason we do n't put butter on sandwiches . 
  afaik i 've never had any international butter . 
  i like mayo on chicken sandwiches too , for what that 's worth . 
  those are made from brewer 's yeast , so i guess that makes sense . 
  i 've never tried either , though . 
  it probably tastes that way because that 's what it is are you from italy ? 
  right . 
  i would n't put colman 's on a sandwich . 
  for that i 'd use something like [ gulden 's ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3a%2f%2ftse4.mm.bing.net%2fth%3fid%3doip.kru9jxb0v0molsvdteie-geses%26pid%3d15.1&amp;f=1 ) or [ french 's ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3a%2f%2ftse1.mm.bing.net%2fth%3fid%3doip.qxovhktgivoj7qspylifuaeses%26pid%3d15.1&amp;f=1 ) . 
  [ heinz ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3a%2f%2ftse4.mm.bing.net%2fth%3fid%3doip.5rzec6zb0eyfioxuwlmypaeses%26pid%3d15.1&amp;f=1 ) recently introduced a mustard to complement their [ ketchup ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3a%2f%2ftse4.mm.bing.net%2fth%3fid%3doip.5vliihcukornswzeg0ez7qeses%26pid%3d15.1&amp;f=1 ) as well , but it 's similar to french 's so i 'll include it for completeness rather than comparison . 
  i 've seen posts on r/askanamerican at least twice in the past month from non-americans asking about that , so i figured to turn the question back . 
  i had n't realized our butter is sweetened to that point . 
  good to know !, 
  fair point , but it 's easy enough to make at home . 
  still , good to know !, 
  i 'll have none of that false-butter talk, 
  fair point !, 
  that sounds like something from r/eatcheapandheathy or r/studentfood , especially with something like shredded roasted chicken added . 
  that 's the bad side of our gun culture, 
  hard and soft cider are both delicious , and popular, 
  that sounds delicious !, 
  have an upvote , friend !, 
  labor unions have lost a ** lot ** of power and influence in the us in the past few decades . 
  hell , i was once released from a position where i was a union member and even the union representative did n't help me . 
  this was in 2010 , for a bit of context . 
  as far as i know it had nothing to do with politics . 
  just a poorly-run company . 
  common , but not legal from a business perspective . 
  if an employer fired an employee for religion or politics it would be grounds for a lawsuit . 
  i 'll try it with peanut butter thanks, 
  describing us democrats as `` leftists '' and `` liberals '' is n't entirely accurate . 
  at this point our conservatives ( republicans ) are more like classical liberals , seeking the smallest government possible with the least aid given to the citizens , and the democrats are actually pretty close to the center . 
  i find it amusing and somewhat ironic that our left-most politician ( senator bernie sanders ) is independent of any political party , and even then he 's barely on the left . 
  as an aside , i have a friend in dublin who told me just today that she does n't trust any government , `` they 're just not trustworthy . '', 
  not much , but i 've been to a few different cities close to mine ( philadelphia , pennsylvania ) , which is reasonably close to the capital ( washington dc ) . 
  good for a day trip , and i 've done that a few times . 
  not the same bread as we use for sandwiches , but it 's not unheard of to eat cream cheese on crackers , and it 's very popular to eat a bagel with cream cheese . 
  you 're correct . 
  it implies you 're still away . 
  nice, 
  politics and healthcare , both at once . 
  in the us we 'd mix chicken or tuna with mayonnaise and celery to make what we 'd call `` chicken salad '' or `` tuna salad , '' and that 's eaten either on crackers or as a sandwich , and i suppose that 's similar to the * pan bagnat * . 
  we love butter too , but it 's much more often used as an ingredient rather than a spread , apparently because the bread we usually eat is very soft and would easily tear . 
  we do have breads similar to the * baguette * , especially in cities like philadelphia and new orleans , where it 's used to make hoagies and po ` boys , respectively . 
  a hoagie would usually have its own spread , made with oil and vinegar ( similar to a salad dressing ) , and a po ` boy usually has either mayonnaise or brown gravy . 
  i 've seen those butter dishes , but i do n't know anyone who has one . 
  to answer your question , butter goes on the outside of grilled cheese so the bread wo n't burn when it 's fried on the griddle . 
  ( we call it `` grilled , '' but it 's actually fried on a griddle or in a skillet . 
  i do n't know why ) . 
  as for using butter so the bread is n't dry , that 's why we use mayonnaise or mustard . 
  to address the issue of your dislike of mayonnaise , maybe you should try making your own , in case you ca n't get more * winiary * . 
  you might stumble across something close to it , or even better !, 
  in the us butter is usually only used as a spread for toast or dinner rolls , or on the outside of bread for grilled cheese . 
  mustard is popular as a spread for sandwiches , and mayonnaise is also . 
  sometimes we use mayonnaise instead of butter for grilled cheese , though this is seen as somewhat of a lower-class choice . 
  it 's just a cultural difference , i suppose . 
  americans have been eating peanut butter for over 150 years , so i 'd say we 're simply used to it . 
  that said , i do on rare occasions eat toast with both butter and jelly , and also toasted bagels with jelly and cream cheese . 
  i 'd use peanut butter for a sandwich with jelly or nutella , and with honey as well . 
  more likely with nutella than jelly , since i eat nutella more often . 
  we 're not fine with it . 
  as i said above , more americans are now comfortable with the idea of socialized healthcare with the affordable care act , but the party in power right now wants to take that away . 
  the people are fighting back , and the lawmakers are literally running scared , but the earliest chance we have to vote them out is in 2018 . 
  it 's not that the average citizen does n't want to , it 's that the * politicians * do n't want to . 
  our politicians are basically owned by the military-industrial complex , the pharmaceutical industry , and the insurance industry . 
  we 'd have to eliminate that relationship clusterfuck first before we could fix healthcare . 
  the good news is that more and more americans are realizing how convenient socialized medicine is , even if their only experience is with the affordable care act .
