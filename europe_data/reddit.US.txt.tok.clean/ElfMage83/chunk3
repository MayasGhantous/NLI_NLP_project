  have you seen our guy ? 
   france ( where i am from )   french fries i had n't figured you guys would use our term . 
  * quel surprise *, 
  pants on fire . 
  and i know a thing or two about that . 
  probably, 
  i 'm reminded of her holding hands with trump , and further reminded of [ this clip ] ( https://youtu.be/fsh88ae_ggq ) from * the simpsons * . 
  somehow i honestly doubt she got that idea on her own . 
  if i did n't know you 're not american , i 'd think you 're american, 
  jeff ? 
  i was n't that surprised . 
  he 's not asking for anything the us has never had ( except maybe for single-payer healthcare and bigger social programs ) . 
  post-secondary education was generally free or inexpensive until reagan fucked everything up by getting rid of regulations on banks and other lending , allowing tuition for colleges and universities to rise into the $ 100k + range for four years at the top schools or for professions like medicine and law . 
  another huge problem is our pathetic minimum wage ( $ 7.25 / $ 6.44 per hour , since july 1st 2009 ) . 
  we 're stuck between crushing debt and ineffective legislators , and with all the corporate money thrown around it 's not easy to change . 
  i wish our conservatives were still like [ dwight eisenhower . 
  ] ( http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/ikesocial.asp ), 
  not that you 're wrong about fptp and electoral reform , but i think another important part of it is huge amounts of corporate money in our politics , which is ( unfortunately ) explicitly legal after a supreme court ruling we call [ * citizens united * . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizens_united_v._fec ) fix that and we can more easily fix the rest . 
  no idea, 
  i got canadian , standard american , and singaporean ( ???? ), 
  for my dialect matches , and english , romanian ( ???? 
  ) , and finnish ( ???? ), 
  as my guesses for native language . 
  i 'm more than a little bit confused . 
  fair enough . 
  unlike our president , i can admit my ignorance . 
  he 's as dumb as his boss . 
  stuck in the [ `` jim crow '' era . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jim_crow_laws ), 
  same here . 
  especially [ our attorney general . 
  ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/jeff-sessions-marijuana-quotes-about-pot-570177 ) i 'm horrified that he 's in charge of our law enforcement . 
  no snakes , though . 
  that 's a plus . 
  i think a lot of people in brussels would object to that . 
  the district of columbia was planned and created specifically to be the capital of the us . 
  brussels was simply declared as such for belgium , or at least without such planning . 
   yellow for liberals that fits with our [ libertarian party . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libertarian_party_%28united_states%29 ) they 're all about small-government and abolishing welfare . 
  this might be more of a stew , but i 'll say [ new england clam chowder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_england_clam_chowder ) or [ gumbo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gumbo ) ( cajun style is best imo , with [ okra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/okra ) rather than [ * fil\u00e9 * powder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fil%c3%a9_powder ) ) . 
  for soups as such i 'll say basic bean soup , with bacon . 
  we like our flag . 
  we sing at least our own national anthem at most sporting events ( also the canadian anthem as applicable ) . 
  we fought from the beginning to earn our flag , and i 'd say it 's just a point of pride . 
  if you guys and new york ( doubtful since there 's a democrat in the ny state senate who caucuses with the republicans ) do it i think the rest of the states will fall like dominoes . 
  new jersey is [ pushing for single-payer too . 
  ] ( https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/05/26/face-trumpcare-abomination-new-jersey-latest-state-join-single-payer-push ), 
  sounds like what happened here after his inauguration . 
  it 's so important for him to be on speaking terms with other rulers that he should just not speak to anyone at all . 
  dude is foggy in the head and it 's bad for everyone . 
  i had n't thought to check for that sub . 
  thanks !, 
  weeks ? 
  dude complains about the news within an hour . 
  considering how half your former colonies are now independently self-governed that makes sense . 
  however , i would n't be where i am without it , so thanks, 
   degeneratory i think you might be looking for `` derogatory . '', 
  professional american football has been around since the 1920s , and at the college level since the 1890s . 
  the super bowl was created in the mid-1960s . 
  that said , you 're correct that the super bowl is more about the show than the game . 
  at this point , people watch the super bowl for the commercials . 
  seems i have something of a knack for linguistic analysis, 
  i think it 's more the way it 's pronounced than the word itself . 
  nice, 
  had to be clear, 
  right . 
  maybe i erred a bit in my op in suggesting americans make friends quickly and easily ( not all of us do , and many are n't wired that way ) . 
  it 's more about politeness . 
  well , maybe not all of us , but i do . 
  it 's okay !, 
  now we both know, 
  dude asked a question , and i answered . 
  thanks !, 
   i used to love man v food on tv but would get a little irritated at adam 's pronunciations of `` basil '' and `` oregano . '', 
  he 's right , though . 
  i 'm not picking on you , i promise . 
  just letting off some steam . 
   `` sail boat '' instead of `` sailing boat '' it 's a boat that has a sail , as opposed to one that 's rowed . 
  thus , `` sailboat . ''  instead of `` writing to you '' they will `` write you . '', 
  better that than using `` phone '' as a verb when it 's a noun , and calling a cellular phone a `` mobile , '' and pronouncing the second syllable like `` trial . '' as for your example , it 's just dropping the preposition . 
  for that matter , why do british people say they 're `` sat '' somewhere when they continue to sit and therefore are clearly ** sitting ** ? 
  * ` erbs * grow in gardens or pots . 
  herbs implies more than one guy named herb . 
  if it makes you feel better at all we do pronounce the `` h '' in `` herbivore . '', 
  british people are even worse with `` paella . '' nigella lawson calls it `` pie-el-la . '' makes me cringe . 
  how is it pronounced ? 
  my next door neighbor for many years was greek-descended american , and his parents spoke more greek than english . 
  i do n't claim to be an expert , but i can at least pronounce `` gyros . '', 
  i 'd spell it `` \u00dcber . '' pronounced somewhat like `` ee-ber , '' but it 's difficult to convey purely in text . 
  afaik it translates to `` over '' or `` above . '' please correct me if i 'm wrong on any of that , and accept my apology if i am . 
  your first and last points are fact , and your second point was an observation based on incomplete knowledge . 
  i apologize for that . 
  i do n't know what you mean, 
  yes . 
  i honestly meant no offense . 
  right . 
  if people get offended that 's not my fault . 
  true . 
  i just feel like i offended a lot of people .
