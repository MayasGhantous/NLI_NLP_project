  fair enough . 
  i did n't understand how contentious this question would be . 
  i apologize . 
   you fit perfectly into sas stereotypes how so ? 
  my wallet is n't that big . 
  not that i do n't want to . 
  i do n't have money to travel . 
  nope . 
  travel takes more money than i have . 
  probably not . 
  i guess i should n't have made the comparison . 
   my main problem with ` small talk with * strangers * ' is that i know that people would be too polite to tell me that they do n't want to talk right now , and i would n't want to force something on them they do not want - i know this would happen because i myself have been too polite to end conversations i did not want to have . 
  not that we expect to exchange life stories with people we do n't know , but many americans feel it 's polite to comment on weather , for example . 
  i did that just today while i was out for lunch . 
   it also feels like intruding on someone 's privacy when you just start to talk to them . 
  you should have a better reason than `` i 'm bored and i presume you 're also bored '' . 
  it just is n't something that 's done . 
  as others have said , it 's just a cultural difference . 
    do europeans not make friends that way ? 
    most certainly we do not make friends that way . 
  do you guys honestly start friendships like that ? 
  how many friends would you say is an average number to have ? 
  not always , and not usually immediately . 
  more often if you see the same person often in different places . 
   maybe it would even be better to define ` friend ' . 
  people i work with are ` colleagues ' , other people i ~ ~ meat ~ ~ encounter semi-frequently - maybe a neighbor or someone who frequents the same social circles as me and whom i meet randomly from time to time - are acquaintances . 
  only people whom i * choose * to meet in my spare time i would consider friends . 
  right . 
  perhaps i should have worded my op differently . 
   ps : is ` whom ' used correctly here ? 
  i can never figure it out . 
  edit : reading it again i think whom is wrong ... or is it ? ... hmm ... 
  `` whom '' is indeed correct as you 've used it . 
  it replaces `` them '' in this case . 
  `` who '' replaces `` he '' or `` she , '' and that 's also correct as you 've used it . 
  my passport is empty . 
  maybe not from only one meeting or conversation , but possibly from seeing someone often and in different places . 
  i did n't mean to suggest we 're all instantly friends after just one meeting , but it 's generally accepted to be more friendly with people you see often . 
  the us is one country , but the states are as you described europe . 
  maybe not quite as clear-cut for differences , but states stick together here as much as whole countries in europe do . 
  for example , i live in pennsylvania , in philadelphia specifically , and though i might rib on pittsburgh we both talk shit about new york, 
  seems like a north/south divide . 
  much like in the us . 
  maybe it 's just as much that you were in houston . 
  texans are especially friendly like that . 
  maybe you should talk more with your neighbors . 
  since they 're your neighbors . 
  just saying . 
   sauce bourguignonne explain , please . 
  of course . 
  good advice !, 
  thank you !, 
  i would n't either . 
  one of my cousins used to make it when i was younger , but she 's ghetto as hell, 
  fair enough, 
  i also did n't say it 's a substitute . 
  to me , ketchup is too smooth for pizza , unless it 's [ poor man 's pizza . 
  ketchup with * cordon bleu * ? 
  ketchup has acids , salt , and sugars , and all of this helps to break down meat . 
  we use it a lot with beef and chicken , and also bacon , eggs , and potatoes . 
  not often with sausages , though . 
   what the american food industry , especially the fast variety , has gifted the world increased rates of diabetes , heart attack , and high cholesterol ? 
   the oil wo n't even stick to the spaghetti . 
  it would if you add butter , or an egg like in * carbonara * . 
  that , plus some parsley and oregano , makes some good stuff . 
  why would you put ketchup on pizza ? 
  ketchup goes with burgers and fries . 
  pizza has tomato sauce . 
  that 's why you put the salt in the ketchup instead of on the fries . 
  or with ketchup, 
  ketchup should be legally banned from hot dogs if the hot dog is eaten by someone over the age of seven . 
  i did n't find that page , but i did find [ this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/idiot ) it describes to me a certain reality tv host-turned-potus . 
  i 've only smoked once , so i do n't know much about it . 
   as for why it means different things in the us , it 's because the us are slightly to the right . 
    most democrats consider themselves left wing , but they do n't go far enough economically to declare themselves socialists or social democrats or something like that ( other than sanders . 
  is there any other famous `` democratic socialist '' democrat ? ), 
  hence why they call themselves liberals . 
  tl ; dr too much money in us politics . 
  bernie sanders is an independent senator in our congress , not tied to any political party . 
  he 's not counted among democrats except in caucus votes in the senate , and if you ask most of our conservatives he 's a communist , just because he wants us to have things such as universal healthcare and tuition-free college , which they do n't like . 
  the problem is that our politics focuses on economic rather than social issues , and if a policy ca n't make money then it 's not discussed by politicians regardless of social benefit . 
  that 's a large part of why we do n't have universal healthcare ; it would take money from insurance companies , and they do n't want that . 
  there 's [ a bill in our lower house ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medicare_for_all ) ( not to be confused with [ this piece of trash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_health_care_act_of_2017 ) ) which aims to do it , but i have n't seen that it 's ever been debated . 
  how so ? 
  so it 's not actually legal there ? 
  like your government just says \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af and pretty much lets it slide , like ours does with the laws in those states that have them ? 
  most of us do n't eat that very often . 
  technically the votes * are * proportional , since it goes by representatives plus senators per state . 
  each representative in our lower house speaks for a certain number of people in their state . 
  smaller or less-populated states have only one representative in the house , and each state must by law have at least one . 
  the problem there is that [ there 's a law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apportionment_act_of_1911 ) that limits the number in the house to 435 . 
  at this point that 's one representative for every ~ 710k americans . 
  our constitution originally sets one representative for every 30k americans , but then we 'd need a whole new house building and that 's not easy to do . 
  as far as eliminating `` swing states , '' this most recent election makes an excellent case for ranked voting . 
  hell , we could even go back to the original system that way , where the candidate with the most votes becomes potus and the runner-up becomes vice-president . 
  just let 's do that * after * trump and hillary both go away . 
  thank you !, 
  agreed . 
  it 's fucked .
