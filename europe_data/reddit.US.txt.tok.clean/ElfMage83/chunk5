  yup . 
  this is a problem . 
   american punishment in general is very harsh it 's about to [ get harsher . 
  ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2017/05/12/doj-reinstates-hard-line-prosecution-guidelines-in-memo-to-us-attorneys/ ) this is a problem . 
   that 's the main reason why 693 in 100k americans is in prison compared to 54 in 100k swedes or 69 in 100k dutch people . 
  the problem is our powerful and extensive system of for-profit prisons . 
  cons in cells means money in the bank . 
   * most drugs are illegal ( exept alcohol , tobacco and ~ ~ coffeine ~ ~ caffeine ) same here , except for prescriptions and medicines bought in shops , plus marijuana is legal in several states for at least medicinal purposes . 
   * police rather focus on dealers not here . 
  possession is at least as bad in most cases . 
   * addicts can seek help in the social system here too , but it 's not as good as it should be . 
   * ~ ~ marihuana ~ ~ weed is widespread among the younger population see above . 
  as long as he 's not hiding in the bushes . 
   the us election system is not democratic ( candidate with the least amount of votes won , wow . ), 
  that 's the [ electoral college ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_college_%28united_states%29 ) , which is a separate thing from non-democratic election . 
  a properly democratic election would have allowed the candidates the people preferred , instead of one candidate manipulating the circumstances of her party 's voting process in the primary cycle . 
  ( it 's entirely true to say i do n't like hillary as a politician . 
  i have no problem with hillary as a woman . 
  bernie would have won . ), 
  as long as trump survives his full term and does n't run again , and hillary goes away , the ec can fuck off . 
  thank you !, 
  is it much different from [ this ? 
  no denying a certain amount of political influence from nk , however small . 
  as a communist country nk could affect how russia operates in the eu and that could ripple outward . 
  we probably do n't have any of those promotional burgers , and now i 'm sad for knowing they exist because they look delicious, 
  fair enough . 
   the majority of countries are as rich as the us or even richer . 
  [ not exactly . 
  ] ( http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/52fbebb26da8118073a77348-538/us-state-gdp-map.jpg ), 
  wikipedia says it 's just in the tarantinoverse . 
  sometimes we 're behind the curve . 
  ca n't be helped . 
  then again , maybe it 's just a different name here . 
  [ this ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3a%2f%2ftse1.mm.bing.net%2fth%3fid%3doip.fbesxakbrvo2wdbp0avdaaeves%26pid%3d15.1&amp;f=1 ) is a chicken burger . 
  would i be right to guess you have n't had it ? 
  the chicken burger is newer , and i have n't had that . 
  as for adding cheese , i 'll do that any time i can i added bacon and cheese to the [ kfc zinger sandwich ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3a%2f%2ftse4.mm.bing.net%2fth%3fid%3doip.lruwjpq1-k28_obui5fdhwesdj%26pid%3d15.1&amp;f=1 ) i had last week , for extra yum, 
   tomatoes and salad that sounds to me more like the [ whopper with cheese ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3a%2f%2ftse1.mm.bing.net%2fth%3fid%3doip.obdt4_ccbthodrd9i4uzhwesen%26pid%3d15.1&amp;f=1 ) , which we have here from burger king . 
  that comes with tomato , lettuce , sliced white onion , pickles ( pickled cucumbers are simply `` pickles '' in the us ) , ketchup , and mayonnaise , plus the beef patty and cheese on the bun . 
  i do understand that . 
  thanks to the internet i 'm increasingly more aware that there are other countries than just the us . 
  i wish we had year-round mcrib sandwiches here like in germany , or a sensible drinking age like literally almost everywhere else . 
  exactly . 
  it adds flavor as well as heat . 
  i 'm a tea drinker . 
  chai is very good . 
  when i do drink coffee , it 's * caf\u00e9 au lait * from caf\u00e9 du monde in new orleans . 
  that makes a bit more sense . 
  i like hot sauce when i can get it, 
   ~ ~ mac ~ ~ ** mc ** donald 's  starbucks   shit coffee i do n't drink starbucks coffee , so i do n't know, 
  if the line is dubbed as you say , does n't that mess up the scene ? 
  is that similar to the earlier one ? 
  i 've seen commercials lately about new `` artisan '' burgers at mcdonald 's . 
  i think they 're trying too hard to win back customers . 
  i have n't eaten from mcdonald 's in months . 
   americans do n't eat french fries with mayonnaise . 
  no we do n't , not usually . 
  some of us mix mayonnaise and ketchup to make * fry sauce * , but not me . 
  i mix my ketchup with sriracha or some other hot sauce if anything . 
   or tarantino just thought it sounded better . 
  i know m\u00e9lanie laurent talked about how tarantino did n't care if something in french was n't 100 % right as long as it sounded good to him sounds about right . 
  i 've read he could be pretty demanding and persnickety . 
  ( yes , that last word has an `` s , '' as is correct ), 
  it 's possible the word `` with '' was added * ad lib * in the movie . 
  * merci * !, 
  the movie is from 1994 , so maybe tarantino figured nobody would notice thank you !, 
  according to the movie it 's what you guys call a quarter pounder with cheese , which is sold at mcdonald 's . 
  i do n't know any other meaning , and i 'm not sure if i want to . 
  i hate that smell, 
  good point . 
  sometimes a clean slate is best . 
  i guess i over-analyzed your comment to ask my question . 
   after the uk is gone do you mean like broken up , or post-monarchy ? 
  it might also help to have a unified , actually-democratic korea . 
  china does n't seem to mind as much as long as prc and `` chinese taipei '' are treated separately . 
  however , i say all this as an american . 
  i do . 
  it 's twelve ounces . 
  i worked as a pharmacy technician for over three years , and now i 'm studying for a nursing program . 
  most of us know enough about medicine and tv to know cc and mg for dosage , if only for that reason . 
  nasa is run by the government . 
  lockheed is a private company , not bound or necessarily expected to follow the same guidelines . 
  nasa was using metric . 
  the private company used us units . 
  she only eats delicious food like that when she 's pregnant ? 
  why would you pee on something so beautiful ? 
  we already have dual measurements on most labels for food and such . 
  we 're just as weird, 
  thanks !, 
  it can if states want federal money . 
  that 's why our drinking age is 21 rather than 17 or 18 ; a law was passed in 1984 that said any state with a drinking age lower than 21 would lose 10 % of federal highway funding . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_minimum_drinking_age_act ), 
  true . 
  makes me sad . 
  si is easier . 
  i think your espn example is a little inaccurate , since football is counted in yards and inches and baseball is counted in feet , but aside from that i understand what you 're saying . 
  however , even simpler would be a law mandating a complete shift to si by a certain date , perhaps on pain of losing funding like with our drinking age . 
  thanks . 
  was n't sure . 
  why would it depend on media more than schools ?
