  schools are part of the government , and most students here are taught in public ( taxpayer-funded ) schools . 
  i do n't understand what media would do . 
  yup . 
  i knew your imperial pint was bigger , but i was n't sure how much . 
  i did n't make the rules . 
   school or official are meaningless . 
    english is n't the official language of the united states . 
  there is no official national language . 
  i 'm aware of this . 
   yet i absolutely expect the vast majority of americans to speak english , and would be very surprised if the president held a state of the union in another language . 
  most of us do speak english . 
  i have a problem with the fact that it 's largely * only * english . 
   metric being official is similarly not significant and i definitely expect most americans to think of their height in feets and inches , and of their commute in miles . 
  why ? 
   there 's also lots of stuff everyone has in school but forgets soon thereafter . 
  i would give some examples , but i 've already forgotten enough . 
  the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, 
  i guess i 'm in the minority , since i do n't mind thinking metrically . 
  it 's all confusing . 
  also , you misspelled `` gasoline '', 
  right . 
  was n't there also something with a satellite or a probe too , that somebody 's numbers were off and the craft missed its target ? 
  you 're correct from a historical standpoint , but now it 's all relative to metric units . 
  why would we do that ? 
  makes no sense . 
  fair point . 
  now you 're getting into semantics . 
  per wikipedia , an imperial pint is 20 ounces , with each imperial ounce being ~ 28.41 ml , but a us customary pint is 16 ounces , with each us ounce being ~ 29.6 ml . 
  thus , your imperial pint is bigger . 
  you did n't have to change it . 
  i understood * x * to be a random arbitrary number . 
  probably . 
  that 's what we both get for being different . 
  imperial is what you guys use . 
  ours is customary, 
  as i said . 
  * grey 's anatomy * is a medical drama , and in shows like that as well as crime dramas such as the various * csi * and * ncis * series the medical examiners and doctors often use si units eg giving a deceased victim 's weight as a mass in kilograms or height in meters , or a drug dosage in ml or mg . also , as you said , to sound sciency . 
  it 's all science . 
  there 's just no big push for it to be used here exclusively for everything all the time . 
  as i 've said elsewhere in the comments on this , just because everyone here does n't use it for everything all the time does n't mean it 's not official . 
  as far as the pound for both weight and force , weight is defined as a measure of the effect of gravity on mass . 
  thus , it 's accurate . 
  most of us might have to think a bit , but the metric system is taught in our schools . 
  as for tv , you wo n't hear it much outside of crime dramas and shows like `` grey 's anatomy . '', 
  `` officially '' does n't always mean `` practically . '' besides , in the video it says that the us units are derived from and defined by metric units . 
  sure we do . 
  just not exclusively . 
  it depends on the work we do . 
  fun fact : you can use the fibonacci sequence for rough conversion between miles and klicks ( that 's kilometers among the military here ) . 
  what do you mean ? 
  one day i 'll try it for myself food is life , and i do like to travel . 
  it 's nice if you can afford it . 
  most of us ca n't afford it , and a lot of us do n't want to travel . 
  that said , i 'm only in the `` ca n't afford it '' category . 
  not to disrespect what seems to be a favorite food , but americans might think you eat nothing else since you talk about it so much . 
  it is . 
  i appreciate the sympathy from people in other countries ( especially in europe ) about why the us does n't have universal healthcare ( for instance ) , but at the same time i 'm sad that it 's even a thing . 
  i love my country , but the government sucks, 
  the rigged primary is n't [ supposed ] ( http://observer.com/2017/02/dnc-chair-candidate-tom-perez-admits-democratic-primaries-rigged/ ) or [ hypothetical ] ( http://observer.com/2016/07/wikileaks-proves-primary-was-rigged-dnc-undermined-democracy/ ) . 
  as far as voting in primaries , i do . 
  the fact remains that [ hillary cheated ] ( https://www.tapwires.com/2017/05/03/dnc-we-rigged-primaries-so-what ) . 
  most of the reason it 's this big now is that bernie and barack have different ethics . 
  you know you can have both , right ? 
  even [ with banana .

   in the usa social democracy is n't , democratic socialism is n't . 
  if social democracy is n't popular in the us , why does [ this gallup poll ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/191504/majority-support-idea-fed-funded-healthcare-system.aspx ) say that more than half of americans support single-payer healthcare ? 
  why does [ this salon article ] ( http://www.salon.com/2016/05/17/they_agree_with_bernie_majority_of_americans_support_single_payer_medicare_for_all_health_care_system/ ) back that up ? 
  if social democracy is n't popular in the us , why do more than half of americans support [ tuition-free college ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/01/over-60-of-americans-back-tuition-free-college-survey-says.html ) ?

  ] ( https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/2017/03/17/fox-news-poll-bernie-sanders-most-popular-politician-america/99323334/ )  if he runs again in 2020 , you 'll have an 80yo president . 
  i do n't think a lot of people are gon na be excited about that . 
  we 'll be excited if it 's bernie . 
  hillary won because she cheated . 
  arizona closed 2/3 of polling locations to limit the number of votes , because of fears that most would vote for bernie . 
  voter rolls in new york were purged of over 120k names for similar reasons ( especially in bernie 's native brooklyn ) , and in nevada the dnc ignored its own rules and declared hillary the winner without even counting the votes . 
  there are other examples , and it 's possible i misremembered the reason for the shenanigans in nevada , but the result is as i said . 
  if you look at a county map of the us from the 2016 democratic primary , most counties voted for bernie sanders as the democratic nominee . 
  hell , hillary could n't even win in counties named clinton except for one . 
  basically , while she might be a good politician , she 's a bad person behind closed doors . 
  indecisive , manipulative , out of touch , and hungry for power above all . 
  she was so focused on winning she did n't even consider the possibility of loss , and i believe her tactics contributed to 46 % of eligible voters not voting at all in the 2016 general election . 
  i know this . 
  i just hope bernie lives to 2020 and runs again , and that hillary goes away in the meantime . 
  hindsight , y' know . 
  fair point . 
  you know better than i do . 
  amendments are what changes our constitution . 
  the problem right now is that our congress is led by people who do n't know how to legislate . 
  hillary would have attracted more votes * period * if she were a better candidate , and bernie would have wiped the floor with trump if he 'd been the nominee . 
  i appreciate that you realize most of us did n't vote for trump . 
  as for changing the rules , our constitution is [ fairly clear on the process ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_five_of_the_united_states_constitution ) , and it 's [ something we 're working on ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_popular_vote_interstate_compact ) , but between the difficulty from the constitution and the present ineffectiveness of our politicians i do n't know how soon it will change . 
  they 're not . 
  many of us think bernie sanders is the best for the job , and even now he 's our most popular politician .
