  mike pence is the vice-president under donald trump . 
  he did n't run in the election . 
  that probably helps in any case, 
  hey now . 
  we 're not * all * that dumb, 
  i was kidding . 
  as much as i love eating crawfish , i prefer the farm-raised kind we have here . 
  mmm , crawfish are they edible ? 
   ~ ~ aurochs ~ ~ ( more than one is * aurochsen * , like * oxen * ) i was going to ask when they were brought back , but then i re-read ( past tense ) your comment and it made me sad . 
  not to defend him , but i think it 's more that he does n't know * how * to truth than that he loves to lie . 
  some casters on youtube have said that trump bases his words on whatever the last person who talked to him said . 
  that sounds closer to reality , as well as addressing his flip-flops . 
  maybe . 
  a lot of americans know about it from movies , but for me i 'd be fine with it . 
  it 's probably mostly because you 're french and a * lot * of americans are attracted to non-us accents . 
   in the us , they hug some of us do , and it depends on upbringing as well as relationship . 
  i do n't hug everyone i know when i meet them . 
  what 's your experience with that ? 
   also bagged milk [ canada has that too ] ( https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3a%2f%2ftse2.mm.bing.net%2fth%3fid%3doip.4mrf-4xeuxltfbazx5cbaqesdh%26pid%3d15.1&amp;f=1 ), 
  we 're working on it . 
  our house of representatives [ passed a bill yesterday ] ( https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628?q=%7b%22search%22%3a%5b%22hr1628%22%5d%7d&amp;r=1 ) that would basically be worse even than what we had * before * the current [ affordable care act ] ( https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3590?q=%7b%22search%22%3a%5b%22hr3590%22%5d%7d&amp;r=4 ) , but there 's [ a separate bill ] ( https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676?q=%7b%22search%22%3a%5b%22hr676%22%5d%7d&amp;r=1 ) also in the house that would expand our current medicare program to cover all americans for basic and emergency needs . 
  i 'm hoping that the senate kills the first bill and passes the second once that passes the house , so that we can then leave private insurance companies to cover situations such as dental , vision , and elective procedures . 
  rather like how canada does it . 
  the problem with that is our current insurance and pharmaceutical industries would push back * hard * on that , because it would cut their profits . 
  it was just the one time most of us do n't have electric kettles , but we manage . 
  the reason is celebrating our independence from our tea-drinking overlords . 
  it 's okay, 
   in germany   flaired for vatican city does not compute . 
  mr. crow 's name was jim , not john , but it 's a minor error . 
  everything else is accurate . 
   i do n't know enough about canada to comment , but the continent ( mainland europe ) has a public-private mix which works well and is less wasteful . 
  as i understand it , the canadian system has basic care covered by taxes , but that does n't include things like dental , vision , and elective procedures . 
  the other stuff is paid out-of-pocket or with a separate private policy . 
    payback in terms of karma   has he been burning coffee ? 
  i do n't know that he drinks coffee . 
  i 've read that he went straightedge after his older brother died . 
    trump is a guy who 'd sign anything on his desk   what , and deny his fans an autograph ? 
  that 'd just be sad . 
  i do n't know that he * has * any fans . 
  i know you were kidding , but that 's no joke . 
  i almost pity him for that . 
   a system which does n't let republicans do anything also does n't let democrats do anything either . 
  that 's not exactly how it works . 
  it 's just that our republicans are so busy trying to craft legislation that pleases the farthest-right members at the same time as those closer to our center , and if they ca n't get those two groups to agree then nothing passes . 
  the democrats might be stubborn , but they know better how to come together on [ issues like healthcare ] ( https://twitter.com/brandnew535/status/859845810418327555 ) . 
    if we could have a shadow cabinet it would probably get things done   eh , you 'd have to have even more elections to elect a leader of the opposition , as they traditionally challenge the prime minister in the uk . 
  only traditionally unfortunately , because the labour front bench is literally a shambles . 
  the division is similar to yours , except the dividers should n't really be in the left-of-centre big party , but the socialist workers party . 
  they are literally communists ( democratic socialists , technically ) . 
  if i could elect anybody for shadow potus it would be bernie sanders . 
  he scares the shit out of most in our government  and on money ... well , well , well . 
  very recently we had an mp called diane abbot , the shadow home secretary ( police , borders , and all that jazz ) get massively confused over recruiting more police . 
  more bobbies on the beat is a vote-winner right ? 
  [ not if you want to pay them a mere # 30 salary ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/02/diane-abbott-has-several-numbers-on-police-costs-sadly-they-are-all-wrong ) . 
  i meant that many democrats have powerful corporate donors who fund their campaigns , and who for that reason do n't want things like single-payer healthcare and tuition-free college since that would decrease profits , but that works too . 
    with something like your nhs to follow . 
    worth bearing in mind that the mixed system most of the world uses is probably better . 
  the nhs is immune from criticism , and has cult-like worship around it . 
  you ca n't attack it or suggest it 's not perfect without public outcry and accusations of privatisation . 
  as you said , it 's sacrosanct ( there 's a $ 10 word for you ) . 
  canada 's system would probably be better for us . 
    trump in the white house is our payback   interesting link , thanks  . 
  still , if you really want to pay us back , there 's some unpaid tax you owe . 
  perhaps just give us some of your fort knox gold ? 
  [ our chancellor sold ours a while back ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/contributed/2012-07-10/gordon-brown-sold-britain%e2%80%99s-gold-artificially-low-prices-bail-out-large-ameri ) . 
  i meant payback in terms of karma , considering what followed that little tea party . 
    that was a joke , a pun on pro and con   i completely missed that :( . 
  and to think i was good at puns ...   opposite members means that when one house is dominated by democrats , the other is usually filled with republicans , and vice versa . 
  equal power means that each has the power of veto , so you need both to agree . 
  since they 're usually at odds due to membership , you have deadlock ( like that slightly alarming affair when you could n't pass a budget ) . 
  of course , sometimes one party has a majority in both houses , but does n't the president have a veto too ? 
  one dominant house is much easier to pass legislation . 
  potus does indeed have the power of veto , but trump is a guy who 'd sign anything on his desk ( probably without reading all those big , important words , too ) . 
  as far as a majority in both houses , infighting among republicans at this point is a very good thing . 
  if they ca n't pass anything then nothing gets done , and that makes it easier for democrats to get elected in 2018 . 
  ( i 'm a political green right now , but a democrat at heart . ), 
    party infighting at this point   you think you have it rough ? 
  we literally have a communist as leader of our labour party ( one of the big two over here ) , who 's is haemorrhaging support because he 's retarded , and has appointed retards to his shadow cabinet ( opposition spokespeople on various ministries ) . 
  the labour party has been torn between the ` ideological pure ' who ca n't win elections , and the ` blairites ' who can ( which somehow makes them traitors ) . 
  if we could have a shadow cabinet it would probably get things done , and faster . 
  nobody hears the other side here because of partisan politics . 
  sounds to me like the division in your labor party is a lot like ours with the democrats , but with the issue of money thrown in here for added fun . 
    i 'd also add the huge-money people , like the walton family of walmart . 
    our asda has gone downhill since they bought it out , hummus just has n't been the same . 
  when our country was rebuilt after the war , we made it easy to climb the social ladder , yours had n't been destroyed ( * insert late joke here * ) and so there was little motivation to `` build a land fit for heroes . '', 
  so america kept the same system , whilst europe redid all of theirs . 
  if i could go back to that period i 'd suggest that the private insurance industry be limited to ten years after the war , with something like your nhs to follow . 
    we had to get creative . 
    with the tea though !? 
  what did it ever do to you ? 
  and to be fair , you started a war and then refused to pay for it with higher taxes that would still be less than the mainlands . 
  i guess you 've come full circle with trump 's wall , getting someone else to pay for your stuff ... trump in the white house is our payback for wasting all that delicious * camellia sinensis * ( [ recently sequenced , and bigger than we thought ] ( http://www.sciencealert.com/the-tea-plant-has-a-whopper-genome-four-times-that-of-coffee-scientists-find ) )   congress seems to be the opposite of progress , especially now . 
    congress has always been that way , because you have two houses with equal power and opposite members . 
  in politics , we call this deadlock . 
  conversely , the uk has ping-pong ( no joke , it 's literally called that ) , where we pass amendments back and forth until agreement , or until a year passes and the commons forces it through . 
  your system is set up to have so many checks and balances that nothing can get done , whereas ours is to go ` fuck it , it 's worked for seven centuries . ', 
  that was a joke , a pun on * pro * and * con * . 
  it 's not really deadlock as much as party infighting at this point . 
  i do n't understand what you mean by `` equal power and opposite members . '' the 435 members of the house represent the people and the 100-member senate represents the states . 
  both major parties are represented in both chambers of congress .
