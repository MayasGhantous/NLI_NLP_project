    as well as our congress . 
    yeah , they 're the american version of our upper/upper-middle class , except more disconnected from the people . 
  sad but true . 
  we 're working on it . 
  i 'd also add the huge-money people , like the walton family of walmart . 
  they 're * definitely * willfully ignorant of what their people need . 
   it 's a shame because you used to have a flexible class system when you were busy being traitors to the crown you guys kept taking our guns and taxing everything else to death ( especially death ) . 
  we had to get creative . 
   but it 's become more rigid over time whilst ours has loosened up a bit ( such as with a commoner marrying a royal , and the working class getting into parliament ) progress is good congress seems to be the opposite of progress , especially now . 
   it 's good to find such a nice american on the internet thank you !, 
   british humour is traditionally more ` dry ' and reliant on sarcasm and irony , so if you 're not used to it our jokes can go over your head . 
  it 's why they had to remake the office , because otherwise you would n't enjoy it . 
  we get most of your humour though , so there are n't as many problems for us . 
  i guess it 's just tougher over text   if by `` class '' you mean `` money ''   close enough i suppose , but it also involves occupation and education , as well as general attitude ( and the ` old boy network ' ) . 
  sounds like the kind of people in donald trump 's cabinet , as well as our congress . 
  lots of money and `` good ol' boy '' backscratching going on at that level . 
   thank goodness i 'm not triggered  i 'm glad, 
   yeah , english english just does n't really have a version of it , so it can be grating . 
  it 's also an americanisation that stereotypically refers to idiot rednecks , so it 's one that we 're not that fond of . 
  idiots and rednecks are like squares and rectangles . 
  that said , i understand the perspective . 
    it 's more that a good education in the us is often prohibitively expensive   i 'm sorry , i was actually making a joke about education and spelling , but i guess you 're not used to british humour : s i guess not  as far as i understand , your education system has massive splits based on location and class , which is why there 's a massive disparity in educational attainment ? 
  we have a similar issue in the uk , called the postcode lottery , where rich parents will move to the catchment areas of good schools to get their children in , whilst poor parents are unable to . 
  if by `` class '' you mean `` money , '' then yes . 
  we do n't really stratify ourselves like you guys do . 
  ( i almost said `` y' all , '' but i did n't want to trigger you )   english to chinese in terms of simplified and standard    i think someone shopped a steam installation picture , which is where the joke originated . 
  good for a chortle , but it 's irritating how many programs either do n't do regional checks for language , or exclude british english ( i hear portugal has a similar issue thanks to brazil ) . 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  for what it 's worth , `` could care less '' is a phrase that bothers me too . 
  as far as `` y' all , '' we just use it because modern english has largely lost the t-v distinction found in older forms and other languages , and it 's a useful and fairly well-understood workaround , more so than such as `` youse '' and `` yinz . '' also , it 's not that our education system is n't good , it 's more that a good education in the us is often prohibitively expensive , for reasons i do n't understand and with which i disagree even as someone able to benefit from it . 
  as far as comparing english to chinese in terms of simplified and standard , that 's something i honestly had n't ever considered before , and i thank you for that bit, 
  it 's a shame we ca n't at least agree on something as basic as spelling and grammar , if not slang and other colloquialisms . 
  i could make a joke about it , but it does bother me a teeny bit . 
  did you read the letter i linked ? 
  that 's in there . 
  if you want your territory back , just say so there 's already a ( probably hypothetical ) [ open letter ] ( http://www.hmsfriday.com/2011/10/17/an-open-letter-from-the-queen-to-america/ ) about it . 
  hell if i know . 
  i understand the theory of conquest , but i guess i 'm still hazy on application and consequences . 
  it 's not something i 'm pushing . 
  those are examples of social programs in the us , paid for by taxes for the use of all . 
  more like modern germany than wwii germany , though we still have quite a way to go to match 21st-century germany . 
  hell if i know . 
  i do n't like war . 
  we should just sit all the leaders in a room with a box of [ us government-issued marijuana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compassionate_investigational_new_drug_program ) and let them chill out for a couple of hours . 
   we do n't like socialism roads ? 
  schools ? 
  medicare and social security ? 
   if the invaders are german that 's a pretty big `` if , '' considering they only [ finished paying reparations in 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_i_reparations ) . 
  for * world war i * . 
  not even wwii . 
   simply place [ this ] ( https://www.bo-alternativ.de/durchfahrt-verboten.jpg ) at your shores ; we did this on every street around westberlin : it works !, 
  i believe it works , but i do n't know what it means . 
  besides , we have a lot of coastline . 
    we already have space to grow tulips . 
    yeah but tulips grow better on lake beds , we grow all our tulips on reclaimed land . 
  we do n't need to reclaim land here except in louisiana . 
  besides that , [ niagara falls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niagara_falls ) is important for hydroelectric power for both canada and the us . 
    maybe let that idea drop . 
  that 's almost 4000 kilometers . 
    we are quite good at building polders . 
  if you combine dutch expertise with the american industrial infrastructure and massive work force , no challenge is too big to take on . 
  i believe your words , and i admire your ambition , but it would still be safer , faster , and cheaper to fly . 
  i understand that . 
  i 'm just saying it would n't work . 
  this question makes no sense . 
  the president must be an [ american citizen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural-born-citizen_clause ) . 
   universal healthcare !, 
  [ we 're working on it ] ( https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676 ) . 
   now , let 's see if i can explain to you that your relationship with guns is not healthy . 
  not all of us have guns . 
  [ not even most of us ] ( https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/22/study-guns-owners-violence/90858752/ ) . 
   pump dry the great lakes . 
  we already have [ space to grow tulips ] ( https://mapfight.appspot.com/us-vs-europe/united-states-europe-size-comparison ) . 
   maybe create a polder linking up hawaii to the continental us . 
  maybe let that idea drop . 
  that 's [ almost 4000 kilometers ] ( http://www.distancefromto.net/distance-from-california-to-hawaii ) . 
  i have n't had * pa amb tom\u00e0quet * , but if i had , i 'd appreciate it as such , and not compare it . 
  except perhaps to the italian * bruschetta * , but that 's still a different thing, 
  you can thin it out with milk , and it also comes in `` crunchy '' as opposed to `` creamy , '' where the crunchy pb has crushed peanuts mixed in . 
  thus , varied texture i 'm not trying to proselytize , but only to understand . 
   american can you narrow it down a smidge ? 
   favorite :   - either couscous or buffalo wings +1 for buffalo wings  most hated :   - peanut butter ** how ??? 
  p2 \u2260 freemasonry . 
  that was just something designed to make us look bad , and it backfired . 
   overall i think he is a mess . 
  pretty much . 
  he 's a lonely old man who 's in way over his head . 
   what surprised me a bit is that there seems to be so little coordination between white house/senate , and white house/congress the senate is part of the congress , but it 's all a cluster of fucks . 
   my understanding is that to enact change that lasts multiple presidencies you 'd need them all to work together to make laws . 
  that 's correct . 
  seems like the democrats are [ finally making progress on a healthcare bill ] ( https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676 ) , though . 
  ~ ~ 104 ~ ~ 108 cosponsors out of 193 democrats in the house of representatives . 
  democrats are the minority party in both houses of congress , but it 's definitely a plus . 
   i also think that with the way he slashes at climate protection in the usa , this at a time where we would need to act decisively to counter the worst excesses of it , he is going to have a lasting negative impact on all of us . 
  agreed . 
   i find it scary that he is n't immediately seen as a posturing buffoon by the overwhelming majority who witness him . 
  he is . 
  the problem is that his supporters do n't care . 
  do n't forget putin . 
  probably the only other leader trump would n't think to hang up on .
