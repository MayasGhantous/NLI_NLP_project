  ( i do n't get out much ), 
  no matter which half gets through it 's all bad . 
  trump has signed 32 executive orders in his first 100 days , yet he complained about barack 's use of eos when barack only issued [ 277 executive orders in * eight years * ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/23/obama-executive-orders/ ) . 
  it 's worse when that 's practically the only way trump can get things done . 
  maybe . 
  especially since he can probably find it on a map . 
   i still think he 's mentally ill . [ maybe ] ( http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/17/1486899/-is-donald-trump-suffering-from-delusional-senile-dementia )  i would n't be surprised if he quit before the end of his first four years . 
  shhh !, 
  do n't let that out !, 
  pence is * so much worse * . 
   i think the silver lining is that the us might start taking the role of potus seriously again . 
  definitely one way to maga . 
   i think they are puppets of big business but i think democrats are too . 
  chomsky has said that `` there 's only one party in america : the business party . 
  it has two factions : the democrats and the republicans . '' considering the condescending attitude the democrats have toward bernie sanders and progressive voters i 'd say that 's a huge problem for that party in terms of continued survival , but it looks like they do n't care as long as they get that money . 
   * first powered flight worldwide : wright brothers . 
  god damn right . 
  i understood that reference, 
  it 's a lot of food . 
  i hope you 'll come and enjoy !, 
  he 's the end result of a broken system . 
  hopefully we can get some real progressives to run for congress in 2018 and someone like elizabeth warren to run for president in 2020 . 
  i respect bernie sanders , but i 'm frustrated by his insistence on working on the inside . 
  the democrats do n't want to work with progressives , and they 're only working with bernie because he 's the best we have . 
  there have been protests almost once a week since trump was inaugurated . 
  last weekend was a `` march for science , '' because trump and his cabinet never read a book in their lives . 
  he 's a modern thomas jefferson . ), 
  it 's not a mistake if it 's what you 'd normally say just a quirk of language . 
   the people do n't do jack shit , even though they 're armed . 
  what do you suggest we do ? 
  not * all * of us have guns , by the way . 
  that seems to be a popular misconception . 
   australiens for sure !, 
  come on now . 
  they 're not * that * weird . 
  it might not be bizarre as you see it , but it 's certainly outside what most americans would call `` normal . '' the later seasons are set around the united states ( `` bizarre foods america '' and `` bizarre foods : tasty travels '' ) . 
  as far as his consistent reaction , from what i can tell he keeps an open mind . 
  your guess is better than mine, 
  he 's done that too . 
  he 's eaten [ * casu marzu * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casu_marzu ) in sardinia , * surstr\u00f6mming * at the swedish embassy in washington dc , [ * balut * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balut_%28food%29 ) in thailand , and * fugu * in japan . 
  right . 
  it 's a difference most americans do n't usually consider . 
  we do indeed raise sheep here , but it 's not common . 
  as for liverwurst , i like that in a sandwich with yellow mustard . 
  i 've also had beef heart , and i find that tastes just like steak . 
  in my area we also have [ scrapple ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scrapple ) , which is similar to the german * panhaas * according to wikipedia . 
  i would n't know . 
  i 'm not about that cannibal life, 
  he does n't eat the local citizen , if that 's what you 're asking . 
  as for the different foods , he 's usually pretty descriptive in his reporting on tastes and textures . 
  most americans do n't often eat organ meats , and it 's illegal to import haggis into the us . 
  i think it 's a good show if you like travel-food shows . 
  he 's done a few episodes in the uk , too . 
  he does . 
  he usually has a local citizen available . 
   * we are the austrians . 
  your food will be assimilated . 
  resistance is futile . 
  * * your gastronomical and foodological distinctiveness will be added to our own . 
  right . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  better to unify the common basics into something that would n't violate the tenth amendment . 
  jesus christ , dude . 
  a simple question and you turn it into a guilt trip . 
  hell if i know . 
  it 's just the word we use . 
   * ball * . 
  [ ** ball ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/football_%28ball%29 ) . 
  played on foot , because horses are expensive and temperamental . 
  i wish we had that here, 
  another thing we borrowed from there , along with highways . 
  americans insist gridiron is the only real football because it 's most popular here , and most of the rest of the world prefers association football . 
  i just wanted to bring up the point that we get shit for using a word we did n't even invent . 
   and rugby is n't called football . 
  [ yes it is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rugby_football ) . 
   trump is just a mess of ever switching policies and attitudes . 
  not to defend him , but he might actually be [ suffering from dementia ] ( http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/letters/2016/08/04/a-diagnosis-for-trump-dementia/stories/201608040128?pgpageversion=pgevoke ) . 
  [ so does rugby ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rugby_ball ) . 
  just a question , since they seem to forget they coined the word as well as inventing the game . 
  it 's probably because they 're both played on foot rather than on horseback , as i said . 
  we call it soccer because gridiron football is more popular here , to the point that it 's just `` football . '' still , i think we 'd keep using the terms we do even if association football equals or passes gridiron in popularity in the us , to limit confusion . 
  right , and that bastardization was first used by the english . 
  not by americans . 
  [ business insider , then ? 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/why-americans-call-it-soccer-2014-6 ), 
  nope . 
  football is played on foot , as opposed to on horseback . 
  no eggs involved . 
  it 's all `` football , '' just different codes . 
  i guess it 's just that way now because it stuck . 
  thank you !, 
  not that it was bothering me , but now i know !, 
  right . 
  not that * all * such people want that , but it 's the biggest difference between liberals in europe and the us . 
  i 've read that such games are all `` football '' ( rugby , gridiron , association & c ) because they 're played on foot rather than on horseback . 
  i had a link for that theory , but i 've since lost it . 
   tax returns are public domain in sweden , so if you want to know it 's really easy to get hold on . 
  that 's something we do n't have . 
  i asked my fellow americans recently if they 'd support switching to `` pay as you earn '' as it 's done in many countries in europe , and we 'd need that as part of it .
