they learned that with tibet . 
  i 'm enjoying the truce from a nation that has `` no involvement . '', 
  the issue is that the eu lacks a single fiscal policy while trying to maintain a single monetary policy . 
  the lack of flexibility ( e.g. 
  without an eu germany would now normally start printing money to cheapen its exports to lift itself back out ) is a major reason that the eu is experiencing difficulties with sovereign-debt . 
  the us does not have this structural issue as its monetary policy and its fiscal policies are unified through the fed . 
  this eurozone issue is a primary reason european banks have been pushing eu member states to give more power to the ecb . 
  that might be their goal ? 
  force the french to cancel and point to the west as trying to isolate russia even further . 
  it is strange that the payment would only be issued after the delivery of the second ship ... 
  we are a bit strange but loving our nation while hating the state is the norm . 
  we just do n't hate it enough to knock it off yet ... and are so disillusioned with the state that most people do n't cast ballots unless it 's for the president . 
  considering russia just banned food imports from the imperialistic west i would expect that realization to hit very soon . 
  there are arabs in turkey . 
   well to me `` arab culture '' is the culture of arabic-speaking countries well , sure , but arab culture varies , as does african . 
  it is n't a monolithic culture without variation . 
  i 'm not even sure what you 'd outline as `` arab '' culture in the modern world . 
  as an example , arabs in egypt have noticeable differences to those in turkey ...  where some inhabitants have arab ancestry and others do n't . 
  it is n't some . 
  it 's 80-90 % + in some communities . 
  those are arab or african communities . 
  there are plenty of people living in them that do not speak french in the least . 
   americans attach genetics to nationality adjectives and europeans do n't . 
  in this context african and arab would be a reference to the geographical areas from which those people arrived . 
  everything beyond that is being implied by you . 
  i certainly do n't see you as representative of `` european , '' whatever it is you mean by that . 
  the inference there is that you have one overarching culture ... something that i see argued against on reddit constantly . 
  i do n't think the dutch are anything like the spaniards . 
  i do n't think that moroccan is the same as algerian . 
  i 'm not sure if this is a language barrier i 'm experiencing , but of course they are n't indicative of arab culture of say , the middle east or african culture which varies throughout the entire continent , but they are indicative of arab / african culture of those neighborhoods . 
  however you want to say it in your politically correct manner , e.g. 
  `` of the street . '', 
  aside from your initial point , i do n't think it really changes the fact that that the neighborhoods we 're referring to are overwhelmingly one of those makeups . 
  frame it as a class issue , frame it as idolizing `` thug '' culture as somebody else in this thread ; those neighborhoods are african and/or arab due to the way the french ran their rebuilding efforts . 
  they remain african and arab . 
  pointing out the obvious does n't make it racist . 
  my point was that those neighborhoods rejected and were never accepted as part of the overall french culture . 
  i 'm not at all inferring that african/arab in france = `` of the street '' which seems to be your objection . 
  arab/african was meant as a cultural reference , not racial . 
  those communities do not identify with and are generally not considered to be representative of `` french '' culture . 
  there are a few french films that show life in these communities that i would recommend for both their film qualities and for doing a great job at giving the viewer a sense of what the arab/african communities were/are currently like . 
  * [ la haine ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113247/ ) - almost a decade old but still great * [ the intouchables ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/ ) - wealthgap but feelgood * [ the grocer 's son ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0864770/ ) - nothing really to do with this , i just think it 's a great film you should watch for exposure to french film . 
   what i said was primarily to the `` damned if we do , damned if we do n't ! '', 
  crowd . 
  oh , i know . 
  i 'm just here to rustle . 
  i do n't know why you 're here . 
  they wo n't even let you into the eu . 
  shut up , turkey . 
  we 're quietly ignoring your governments move away from secularism and letting you stick around in nato which is the only real thing preventing the syrian military from crossing your border . 
  if that is n't letting you do what you want then i do n't know what is . 
  could be worse . ^ murica ... 
  [ eh , anyone 7-10 would give you a hard time . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-most-powerful-militaries-2014-12 ) turkey , for instance , would likely be an absolute stalemate . 
  egypt would be fairly hard to invade too since they have a capable military and western weapon systems . 
  outside of that though you 'd be a straight wrecking ball of destruction ... 
  just for clarity sake the us takes in 60k refugees a year and is increasing that total to 100k . 
  it 's not like they can walk to us . 
   do they get houses , driving licenses , branded clothings , bicycles , free healthcare , unemployment benefits for half a decade silly europe . 
  the equipment used in the vws may only have thoroughly vetted with the relaxed requirements in mind though . 
  even if it 's only a 5 % difference that 's a fairly large deviation over the course of a lifetime of a vehicles parts . 
  are n't one euro jobs already a thing in germany ? 
  is n't that how it artificially deflated its primary unemployment rate ? 
   do you seriously believe germany will get out the nato fence ? 
  maybe ? 
  depends on how many start ignoring your guards i wager . 
  hegemony is n't cheap , man . 
  and we get access to some of the most brilliant minds in science through european defense contractors ... bae , saab , finmeccanica , eads , etc. 
   probably not stolen can you expand on this statement ? 
  ehhh , the greeks are offering us a massive new airbase via nato on the island of karpathos . 
  i think that 's a better deal than utilizing a turkish airbase . 
  nobody is gon na use stone though you fucking weirdos, 
  in the us , `` a penny saved is a penny earned . '', 
  franklin never said it but attribute it to him anyway cause ` murica !, 
  yeah , 8-11 million . 
   kicking the americans out of europe silly protectorate . 
  we 'll leave when we 're ready . ^ i ^ only ^ kid ^ ... ^ kind ^ of !, 
  would we ? 
  should we ? 
  probably . 
  the judge says sustained but its pretty rare to object ... 
  most lawyers and judges are work buddies and collogues . 
  they all know the rules and they generally avoid pushing each others buttons . 
  being surrounded by a friendly nato is definitely a budgetary perk . 
  hear hear !,

  i 'm dying from laughter over here that you ca n't understand that only 6 % of the us economy revolves around manufacturing ** and ** that it is still so large that is dwarfs the the rest for the world in terms of final dollar outputs when those goods are exported , which is * still rare * . 
  you 're adorable in your ignorance . 
  manufacturing makes up only 6 % of the us economy and the vast majority is never exported * because we need what we manufacture . 
  *  chinese loans lol , the chinese that own less of our foreign debt ( that is only 15 % of our total debt anyway ) than japan ? 
  your points are still laughably moot . 
  get out of here with this garbage , rooskie . 
  [ canada is actually our number one partner ] ( http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/top/top1504yr.html ) we 'd sell you shit but your balkan ass couldnt afford it . 
  number one exporter of final goods in the world , number two exporter of all goods in the world and that 's only as of recent . 
  you 're just another moron conflating revenue with profit and throwing out red herring arguments because none of your points are worthwhile or arguable against anyone with even the slightest hint of education . 
  get back to your backwater country erecting statues with glow in the dark eyes . 
  we 'll see nothing because oil is a minor part of the dollars value to investors . 
  oil huh ... maybe you would have a point if it was the us invading saudi arabia but the us did n't get shit for iraq i or ii except for a headache .
