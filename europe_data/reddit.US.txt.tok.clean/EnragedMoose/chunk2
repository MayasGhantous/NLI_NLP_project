  all of your comments read like an angsty teen that 's stayed in / r/worldnews for far too long . 
  for instance ... everyone is on a fiat currency and the number one thing you need for your currency to be successful when it 's a fiat currency is trust . 
  guess who investors trust to repay debts ? 
  as it turns out , they trust a stable democracy of 300 million people running an 18 trillion dollar economy that happen to have the single largest concentration of assets in the globe . 
  keep thinking it 's the petro dollar . 
  that 's such a minor part to the dollars strength it 's hilarious anytime somebody mentions it . 
  if we are talking ` murcia there 's zero kissing . 
  hell , hugs between friends is already a question zone . 
  the french went gallivanting without us and realized they couldnt bomb without knowing where to bomb or , ya know , having a stockpile of bombs . 
  the us wanted nothing to do with libya but nato is as nato does so we helped out our buddies ... 
  it was a dumbass french idea to involve itself with libya , not ours . 
  we make and own up to our own poor decisions ... do n't throw the french one our plate . 
  and do n't talk smack without flair you damn commie . 
  we 're closer than you think , nordics . 
  depends if it 's 10 or 0300, 
  can confirm , have two masters . 
  no loans . 
  4 have already pleaded guilty . 
  i think both the umayyad conquest and the golden horde qualify as real and direct threats to european culture even if ` europe ' was n't exactly solidified . 
  true , but he 's correct in saying east coast . 
  that style originated in the northeast and was popularized by tommy hilfiger . 
  the west coast has it 's own take on preppy where polos are still everything . 
  see vinyard vines ( east ) vs johnnie-o ( west ) . 
   so why is the french government silent ? 
  [ because the french have their own storied history of industrial espionage in the 20th century ?

  depends on the locality , man . 
  there are still 100 % dry counties in the us where sale of alcohol is completely illegal . 
  yeah , it is . 
  another poster pointed out it would be closer to 51 billion with a lazy management style ... but oh noes, 
   in school for 5 years you have to to take a foreign language , after that a large majority of people dropped french/german class saying it was pointless as most europeans speak english . 
  truth hurts . 
  getting the french to speak it can be a bit of a challenge though ...  `` this french bastard is going to make me murder his language before he speaks to me in english out of rage ...  `` bonjour !, 
  you do n't understand their plight !, 
  a year of 5 % monthly compounding interest will only give them $ 1.82 trillion !, 
  it would blow my mind if they even cared . 
  i do this in eu iv and it takes forever for those rebels to do anything . 
   it was blowback from polish aggression . 
  lol , k. i guess forcing estonia , latvia and lithuania and station soviet troops was out of their aggression , right ? 
  because the baltic sisters were extremely threatening in the same way that poland , being crushed by two enormous powers on either of its flanks , was threatening . 
   act all mighty . 
  ah , but the mighty must act the part . 
   the ussr did 95 % of all the real work what , like sacrificing poland to form the german -- soviet treaty of friendship , cooperation and demarcation , green lighting the german invasion of western europe ? 
  cri-me-a river . 
  let 's go grab a drink and not talk . 
  we can sit as far apart as you want .

  to be fair to the froggies i understand their desire to not bomb the fuck out of a country without regard to the innocent bystanders ... but to run out of smart munitions in the age of * smart munitions * is incredibly short sighted on their behalf and you 're right , it does exemplify current eu military issues . 
  no reason for you guys to buy it when you could get away with gen 4.5 fighters for the foreseeable future . 
  [ no , both the british and french ran out of certain munitions and were resupplied from us and german stocks .

  sure is n't .

  that 's strange since the usn cut procurement funding for the tomahawk block iv starting with its [ fy 2015 budget .

  you sit ? 
  i thought you fuckers were efficient . 
   though the russians quickly cracked that . 
  source ? 
  arguing through the historical lens of today is a novice mistake when observing history . 
  though i suppose it 's just easier to keep being that edgy teen rather than trying to really wrap your head around the world during the time period . 
  do you vote ? 
   again , negotiating agreements are an exclusive competence of the president . 
  this is because the executive office has been delegated the authority by congress and this was signed off on by the supreme court in * field v. clark ( 1892 ) * . 
  it is * not * because it is the `` competence '' of the president . 
  simply restating your position over and over again does not make you right . 
  i 've gone through the effort to show you why you are wrong in your beliefs by outlining the very laws you cite and giving you a chance to re-read the language . 
  i do hope you take note that you are , in fact , incorrect in your understanding of the us system . 
  * with the advice and the consent of the senate * the president ** may ** engage in ** treaties ** but trade , which we are talking about , is a power granted to congress , not the executive office . 
  it says nothing about `` agreements '' nor does the office have the ability to create agreements on its own . 
  all agreements you are likely familiar with have been executive-congressional-agreements . 
  meaning that congress allowed the agreement to move forward without a formal hearing or passage but * congress * does not need authorization from the president in order to bound the us to an agreement . 
  if the president refused to sign the bill they can simply override him with enough votes . 
  what congress passes is law . 
  the executive branch can be a roadblock but it is not the final word if congress gets enough muster . 
  i think a uk agreement would have such muster . 
  it would not require the uk to sign a treaty or agreement for it to be enforceable . 
  you can see these requirements play out in the creation of the case act . 
  congress is the real owner of trade agreements , not the president . 
   trade agreements are n't a competence of congress , they 're a competence of the executive . 
  the only way a trade agreement could be negotiated between the us and uk would be with the president 's express consent . 
  this is expressly set out in the constitution . 
  no , the commerce clause ( constitution section 8 ) explicitly defines congress as having the capability to establish trade with foreign states . 
   the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states ; but all duties , imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the united states ;  to borrow money on the credit of the united states ;  ** to regulate commerce with foreign nations ** , and among the several states , and with the indian tribes ; the executive branch does n't have all that much power in the us . 
  the executive can negotiate treaties but it can by outright bypassed by the congress . 
  if the uk pm started talking about negotiating an agreement congress would pass an agreement and force the president to veto . 
  under no circumstances would it be politically wise to veto the bill as the us public favors relations with the uk . 
  the us is cordial with all eu member states but the uk/us relationship is maintained above all else . 
  it would take one republican to say `` we 're going to stick it to those euro socialists and help the uk out '' and a democrat would n't need to say anything because democrats generally favor trade deals that are n't with 3rd world countries . 
  i 'd be willing to bet that bill would emerge and get 60 + votes in favor within a few months of brexit . 
  we welcome the world to plant their own flags on the surface of the moon, 
  congress is working towards a deal that will require banks to collect information on who owns and operates the company accounts . 
  that 'll make it much harder to use the shell accounts for anything . 
  also , the follow up episode to that planet money , when they meet with tax attorneys in the us , basically goes to show how useless shell companies are in the us . 
  further there is another planet money regarding the use of shell companies to launder money that was used for an fbi sting operation and the safeguard system in the us worked so well that the fbi had to gag the banks because they identified the laundering operation within a few weeks of operation . 
  poland is eu 's alabama ? 
  they pay 12.5 % of the income they make in ireland from ` trade ' and 25 % of income made inside of ireland . 
  i can appreciate sarcasm but right now it makes you look like an ignorant cynic with no value to add to the discussion . 
  their effective tax rate is 12.4 % , so yes . 
  it 's extremely close to their advertised rates due to their effective tax collection ( i.e.
