  very straightforward ) . 
  at face value , yes . 
  however , our effective rates are among the lowest in the world . 
  if you use weighted averages the us even has negative rates in some instances . 
  the us has an effective corporate tax rate for 12.8 % , just over ireland with its 12.5 % . 
  i do this for precheck anyway . 
  no , it 's like the time the soviet states fled the bloc . 
  totally lured by capitalist pig society . 
  if you 're relying on the nominal measurement , yes , but most economists will refer to ppp for `` quality of life '' to account for the arbitrary nature of `` quality . '', 
  the us ranks 3rd-5th in this index depending on the year . 
  norway is usually first ... sneaky norwegians with their oil reinvestment . 
   of the world happiness report . 
  literally a worthless stat, 
  the un 's primary purpose is to prevent wars in the style of the great wars and in this it is doing a great job . ^ ^ ^ previousperformanceisnotindicativeoffutureperformance, 
   you are right we have the luxury of picking our migrants which certainly helps a ton . 
  i thought you guys were open door ? 
  it 's just a matter of actually getting to the continent that prevents the worst migrants . 
  i think / r/the donald is leaking, 
  the us does n't spend that much to `` maintain [ our ] # 1 spot '' . 
  we spend that much because our military doctrine is aimed at being able to fight two major conflicts at the same time . 
  this varies greatly from the eu stance , which is to arm their troops with broomsticks . 
  we too could save a ton of money if a benevolent empire was allowing us to ignore defense in exchange for political power by arming our troops with wooden sticks and ignoring general maintenance needs . 
  my family has been in america for 500 years and if i tell people that they still ask where in europe we were from . 
  nebraska is the only state that is unicameral but let 's count puerto rico as a state for a second and say it 's a wash . 
   1 has 28 parliaments and heads of states , the other has 1 head of state looking over 50 states . 
  each state has it 's own government with three branches . 
  we have 50 state governments , each with two houses and an executive branch ( governors ) and a court system . 
  the us government is the federal government ... 
  it 's a much more powerful eu parliament in a sense . 
  the eu acts a trade block just as the us states act as a trade block . 
  intra-eu trade should n't count for anything . 
   the eu is now the driving force behind world trade growth , supported by the high level of intraregional trade and also by competitiveness gains relative to the united states . 
  yeah , it 's counting `` intraregional trade '' as being the primary growth driver which it negates for other trade zones as a justification for this point . 
  it is n't * the * driving force . 
  it 's * a * major driving force . 
  also this report seems to be drafted before the q3 numbers were released and q4 numbers are finalized . 
  [ eu-15 is expecting 1.2 ~ 1.4 % for fy 2015 and 1.3 % fy 2016 . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/forecasts/2015_winter_forecast_en.htm ) i 'm simply taking exception with the use of the language . 
  it 's clearly a primary driver of growth but suggesting it eclipses the us with its consistent and [ faster gdp growth ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/25/us-gdp-growth-revised-up-federal-reserve ) ( over 2x the growth of the eu for 2015 ) , structural unemployment near 0 , accelerating wages and productivity is simply untrue . 
  we 're also slaves to the bourgeois . 
  i 'm not sure how this press release could be this incorrect ? 
  [ the report ] ( http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wesp/index.shtml ) that this release cites clearly states :  while developing countries have been the locomotive of global growth since the financial crisis , the developed economies , particularly the united states of america , are expected to contribute more to global growth during the forecast period . 
  the only section that remotely suggests that the `` eu is the driving force '' is that it will be the largest single importer of goods now that the brics are slowing down but this report counts trade between eu members as ` imports ' . 
  this leads me to believe the report is somewhat skewed since no other trade area is treated this way . 
  that is , us inter-state trade is not counted , china inter-province trade is n't counted , etc. 
  the report seemingly treats eu one way for one section ( a trade block ) and then as individualized countries for this section ... 
  it 's an interesting report though , especially when you get to the deleveraging of the securities sectors . 
   who do n't require it it is n't as if we are pouring money into iceland . 
   a need to spend on expeditionary forces having a semi-benevolent military power securing your seas and lands is a great way of reducing your need for defense spending . 
  your point was that the us tax payer gives these industries a free ride . 
  i countered by suggesting that the us tax payer benefits a great deal by having their tax dollars spent on defense . 
  also , it is n't the same for `` any industry . '', 
  the dollar multiplier for agricultural spending , for instance , is negative . 
   i 'm shocked at how little it is . 
  mfw yuropes cry about us increasing our total spending by $ 3.4 b, 
  [ ehh , for every 1 % of defense spending increases states see anywhere from a 1.5 % to 3.0 % gdp increase . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/10/stimulus ) there 's a dollar multiplier effect in play wherein the industry tends to lead to increases in the money supply . 
  $ for $ it 's a great investment because of all of the other industries it supports . 
   americans to not occupy them out of nowhere i mean we left our bases there ... what is there to occupy ? 
  half of those t-90s are working . 
  if * china * or * russia * was landing robots on mars or asteroids we 'd probably care a little more but yurope is over here doing stuff ? 
  but if you want to get into a dick waving contest ... you guys got to an asteroid , huh ? 
  let me know when you have two probes sending data back from beyond the termination shock . 
  honestly , we do n't even care . 
  good job pew pewing between shit in space with civilian projects . 
  the dod has had laser coms for years ... 
  probably why we do n't care . 
  yay , esa has new stuff ... yay ... meh . 
  probably because the land between the two means taking on portuguese and uk navy or having your armies attempt mountain passes ... plus spain was a number of kingdoms hell bent on not being useful to one another ... 
  pretty much like today . 
  it was a joke when the sub was ~ 10-20k of subscribers ... but now we 've gotten fat with nearly 200k subs .

  it 's ok . 
  there there . 
  ca n't wait to see your armory full of broomsticks . 
  smtp does n't support tls/ssl . 
  it 's why s/mime was created . 
  rfc 821 outlines how mail is transferred between mail servers . 
  you should read that . 
  also you should be less of a pompous cunt so you can learn something . 
   you should email google and tell them you 're better than them . 
  you do n't even understand what you 're reading or why the data moving internally being encrypted does n't matter . 
  i 'd love to write contracts with you . 
  you 'd be a goldmine . 
   `` how to poorly translate into english '' . 
  that 's how i was taught french . 
  i ca n't speak it worth a damn but i can kind of understand it when spoken to but i can mostly read it . 
  and i very rarely use it . 
  [ edit ] actually , it 's just stating that they 're forcing the connection between your computer and the google data center to be https . 
  that does nothing for the email protocol itself . 
  it is still plain text once it leaves the mail server . 
  it is not encrypted . 
  you need to use something along the lines s/mime for it to be encrypted . 
  it is literally plain text sent via encapsulated smtp packets that anyone can read . 
  sending from @gmail.com to @gmail.com without s/mime ( which is the industry standard ) will be plain text . 
  he saying that italy has the same capabilities of intercepting email traffic . 
  99 % of email is plain text . 
  it takes nothing but a sniffer or reverse proxy to pull it in and when your telecom companies are compelled to cooperate via legislation it does n't matter where your email is housed . 
  what matters is where the email goes from and to . 
  if it passes along a backbone you can assume it 's being intercepted .
