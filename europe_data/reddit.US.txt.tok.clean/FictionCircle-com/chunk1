you 'd think that but basically once trump is out of office is the gop will filibuster fixing any of his mistakes . 
  well , we elected trump , so you are still coming out ahead . 
  no , no . 
  the ` eastern ' europeans are the bad guys in their films . 
  sometimes the good guys are british . 
  i honestly do n't know . 
  they are as trashy as americans tbh . 
  they just hide it better on tv . 
  the sun never lets _ anyone _ down if they want hilarious headlines . 
  he is n't european and a native english speaker . 
   yeah of course , you would n't want to have to argue . 
   do n't bother , you 've proven to be a dishonest person already . 
  i wo n't bother either . 
  i wonder who has the last laugh though . 
   i wrote it incorrectly . 
  i meant what he literally said , `` it 's not all of them , there 's at least this one '' . 
  so , there is at least one white nationalist in trump 's administration therefore they are all white nationalists is the exact same logic he employs . 
  at which point , you are being dishonest and outright lying by arguing trump is n't a white nationalist since you agree with that kind of logic . 
   he did n't say she represents jewish people , but it 's literally what he said . 
  what ? 
  0 . o you admit its literally what he said and then says he did n't say that ? 
  i 'm not even going to bother sorting out the rest of it . 
  are you implying that trump is a white nationalist ? 
  you 'll have to defend that . 
  i know the person i 'm responding to is a white nationalist who believes trump is a white nationalist . 
  but go ahead , if you want to prove trump is n't a white nationalist please explain : a ) campaigning on nationalist & white identity politics . 
  b ) stephen miller , bannon , the mercers being chosen as his advisers ( all white nationalists ) . 
  c ) him being # 1 with with nationalists . 
  but i mean , sure , you can `` argue ' he is n't a white nationalist if you want but i am still going to laugh at you . 
   great mental gymnastics there . 
  nowhere did they say that they were a white nationalist . 
  capitalizing white , for instance , is the standard way of presenting it as a white nationalist while being improper grammatically without publicly admitting you are such . 
  there are a number of such oddities in / u/vahuety 's posts that are consistent with the dog whistle terms they use to recognize each other without publicly outing themselves . 
  they do this because they believe they are `` oppressed '' and they have to be covert about it . 
  you probably should look through his post history . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/62vmil/proposed_muslim_cemetery_highlights_tensions_in/dfqcrz6/?context=3  i do n't see any non-white countries being forced to accept millions and millions of different races . 
  that kind of thing is only for white countries . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/62vmil/proposed_muslim_cemetery_highlights_tensions_in/dfq1wzx/?context=3  why should this be everyone 's country ? 
  why does every group except white people get to have their own countries but our countries must be for everyone ? 
  he is very consistent in this behavior which is bog standard talking points and dog whistle capitalization for a white nationalist . 
  which is why its a valid comparison to what he is arguing but not a valid comparison in general . 
   she never claimed to be `` king of the jews . '', 
  she founded and was active in many prominent jewish organisations . 
  you really do n't get sarcasm . 
   that 's a good thing . 
  every other racial group has a voice in american politics . 
  there is no reason why white people should have the same opportunity . 
  lol . 
  why am i not surprised some random idiot on the internet who uses the logic `` one jew = all jews '' is a white nationalist ? 
  i 'm not bothering with you further since you think white nationalism is a good thing . 
  you might backtrack or edit but you literally just said it was a good thing so i honestly do n't care what you think . 
   he 's not painting the actions of an entire group of people with the actions of a single individual --  if you think that jews in sweden are so wonderful then perhaps you should look up barbara spectre . 
  -- yes , he is . 
  she was n't elected by a group of people and simply created a think tank . 
  its absurd to argue she represents the jewish people . 
  _ anyone _ can create an `` educational organization '' and claim they represent interest group x. i could do it after work in maybe 15 minutes building a website . 
  this is a joke of a defense . 
   perhaps it 's not exactly whataboutism , but what brush would you paint trump with ? 
  your connotation was negative and he has nothing to do with the topic . 
  in any case , not a proper argument . 
  he does have something to do with the topic because the person i am responding to is a trump supporter who thinks `` white identity politics '' is a good thing and using the same logic he applies , i can brand every white person as a white nationalist . 
   trump is not a white nationalist . 
  no , he just engages in white identity politics , has ties to white nationalists , and appoints them as his advisers . 
  i mean , if you believe that , you go right ahead but the rest of us know what people like stephen miller ( personal friends with richard spencer and a white nationalist ) , bannon and the mercers are . 
  or the fact he is # 1 with white nationalists . 
   trump has never claimed to be a representative of white people , spectre has claimed to be a representative of jews . 
  so , when a crazy person claims to be the king of the jews , you believe them because ??? 
  and therefore its not equivalent . 
  that is equally absurd . 
   trump is n't a white nationalist . 
  he 's just a moronic narcissist who blundered his way onto the back of the alt-right movement . 
  you are aware that his dad was in the kkk and he appointed white nationalists to office , yeah ? 
   whataboutism . 
  it is n't whataboutism to point out he is painting an entire group of people with the actions of a single individual . 
  if you ca n't figure that out , that is really your problem . 
   what brush ? 
  white nationalism . 
   ... and what white organisations has trump founded ? 
  so your argument is you have create an organization for your crazy to be relevant ? 
  that is absurd . 
  i guess all the kkk people who were n't the founder were ok then in your view . 
  trump is n't some marginal character either . 
  that does n't mean i 'd paint every white person with that brush . 
   if you think that jews in sweden are so wonderful then perhaps you should look up barbara spectre . 
   she openly admits to working towards the destruction of european peoples and societies . 
  excellent . 
  why do n't you provide your nationality , religion , and religious beliefs ( if any ) ? 
  i bet you i can find someone who is a madwoman or madman too . 
  my god that is hilarious . 
  the thing is its their own party that has to remove them from power . 
  idk if they have the political will unless they lose the next election . 
  well , hopefully with the uk out of the way , the eu comes to that realization and moves in that direction . 
  the us has numerous `` poor '' states like the eu does but we do n't let it divide us . 
  instead , we redirect resources to help them out . 
  his base believes what he tells them still by some miracle . 
   i do n't know where you 've heard that , but it 's wrong .

  honestly , i kind of find it funny but that could be because our divorce from the uk was more violent . 
  it also feels like progress that this kind of thing can happen in jokes and democratically rather than through violence . 
   hang on .
