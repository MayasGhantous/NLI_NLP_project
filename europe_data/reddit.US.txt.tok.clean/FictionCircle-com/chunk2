  are you saying that everyone knew that spain would veto any deal that does n't turn over gibraltar 's sovereignty to spain ? 
  http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2016/03/gibraltar-impact-brexit  recently spain 's caretaker foreign minister jose maria margallo went on record that if the uk voted to leave the eu he would immediately ` raise with the uk the question of gibraltar . ', 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36618796  brexit : spain calls for joint control of gibraltar yes . 
  yeah , structuring it like the articles of confederation were a mistake . 
  they will/should federalize . 
   i 'd say there 's a difference between pushing for equal treatment for your citizens and trying to annex territory based on a dispute of a centuries-old treaty . 
  still , we 've dealt with continentals trying to annex our territory before . 
  we can do it again . 
  the continental army is very effective at annexing british territory . 
  they are attempting to deflect investigations domestically in the us by appearing `` tough '' on russia . 
  it wo n't last if they stay in power . 
  the anglosphere and the french , unfortunately , are anti-privacy for whatever reason and now the excuse has arrived . 
  yes , i was told the eu was made up of communists too . 
  i 'd like the us to stop meddling as much so :p, 
  no worries , just sometimes i miss the obvious xd, 
  in what manner ? 
  totaling up the lost territory and population as financial assets in terms of `` divorce '' ? 
  its time for us to move to ireland it appears . 
  to be fair , it is n't just reddit . 
  social media in general encourages clickbait and the anti-media social media groups bitch about it . 
  how the fuck did he not get the boot for that ? 
   imagine the costs of burecreacy allone !, 
  this will be the most expensive divorce ever !, 
  i do n't know . 
  the collapse of the british empire might still be the most expensive divorce . 
  well , that is unfortunate if true . 
  i wish you the best of luck on fixing it . 
  in a democracy , it is the general population that votes and while money has influence ... many scandinavian countries have no trouble keeping it from substantially breaking their political systems . 
  honestly , welfare capitalism is a very good system that really does solve the problem better than socialist ideas do . 
   erdogan https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/07/how-erdogan-made-turkey-authoritarian-again/492374/  the current government itself is the product of an election that had to be rerun last november because erdogan was not satisfied with the party 's results the previous june , when elections had taken away the akp 's parliamentary majority . 
  erdogan 's widening purge and crackdown are just the logical conclusion of a story that has been unfolding for the better part of a decade . 
  turkey 's democracy has not been lost -- there was no democracy for it to lose . 
  http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/president-erdogan-approves-constitutional-reform-bill-170210100019275.html  erdogan 's existing time as president will not be counted . 
  if the legislation is approved in the nationwide vote , it could pave the way him to remain in office until 2029 . 
  i bet erodgan 's `` changes '' to the constitution somehow win and he somehow gets re-elected through 2029 , at which point he 'll be in his mid 70s and will likely `` retire from politics '' . 
  so yeah , he is there barring fair elections that stop him . 
  trump is n't dictator for life yet . 
   no democratic or freedom loving institution can survive a culture opposed to liberal ideals . 
  and this clash is precisely what many of us have been warning of . 
  because , with all frankness , erdogan is an aberration we must tolerate for strategic reasons , but the very notion of someone similar being propped up by our own citizens is frightening . 
  this is based on a disturbing whitewashing of history that ignores greece 's military junta , cuba 's fidel castro/raul castro , venezula 's hugo ch\u00e1vez / nicol\u00e1s maduro , chile 's augusto pinochet , nicargua 's daniel ortega , panama 's manuel noriega/omar torrijos , spain 's francisco franco , germany 's hitler , yugoslavia 's josip broz tito , belarus 's alexander lukashenko , fiji 's frank bainimarama , russia 's putin , etc. 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikola_tesla  ( modern-day croatia ) i 'm bad at getting jokes . 
  yes . 
  i 've heard the clockwork elves live in bielefeld and it is the headquarters of the nwo globalists . 
   regardless of if he thought it was genocide , he was a great leader for turkey . 
  you are aware that is like saying [ leader ] was a great leader despite the fact he turned a blind eye to the genocide of [ insert victimized minority of his own citizens ] ? 
  i 'm sure you can think of a few combinations that are problematic using your logic . 
   mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk http://www.armenian-genocide.org/kemal.html as a secularist ? 
  yes . 
  he was , however , unfortunately another one who could have admitted the genocide was in fact a genocide ... and did n't . 
  the week 's news does n't make sense ? 
   i assume the problem is that breitbart publishes shaky editorials , whereas huffpo has more problems in the op-ed department . 
  breitbart is essentially editorials mixed with copy/paste from wires . 
  so yeah , basically . 
   that 's irrelevant . 
  it 's an idiotic law . 
  stopfake is wrong and so eu taskforce . 
  if you are correct , please show me someone actually being denied entry once that law is in effect . 
   maybe everyone but you * is * wrong . 
  i just find it hard to believe . 
   how about that ukrainian citizens ' names must follow ukrainian language rules . 
  so no more nicola , nikolay , but must be mikola . 
  i did n't notice that part . 
  and article 13 states that for people who do n't understand the state language , another language can be chosen . 
  its the same law , it does n't require the exception to be built into every paragraph . 
  i 'll believe you when you can find me an actual citizen who is refused entry because s/he does n't understand the state language . 
   article 13 . 
  the use of the state language in the law enforcement agencies  1 . 
  the language of statutes , documents , records management , performance management and communication with citizens of ukraine law enforcement agencies in the state language . 
  for a person who does not understand the state language , law enforcement agencies can communicate in a language acceptable to the parties . 
  you ignore the exception that exists basically right after for people who do n't understand ukranian . 
  all you quoted was it * defaults * to ukranian . 
  the customs/border guard is a law enforcement agency . 
  since the rules do n't allow me to link to rt. . . i 've removed those . 
  please look for the russian article yourself and then you 'll see the lack of an english translation . 
   a ) i find it interesting an `` american '' flagged user cares this much about ukranian border control laws that will never effect him . 
  b ) http://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-new-language-law-will-make-ukrainian-exclusive/ c ) you are parroting the lines of rt and other russian propaganda outlets based on the original russian word for word . 
  search for ukranian + language + law on the english rt. 
  rt does n't have the english version of the article up yet . 
  d ) http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?pf3511=60953 < - no where in that law requires what you suggest , it just requires ukranian translations . 
  humor me , find where it says what you claim in the law . 
  e ) good luck . 
   now if a ukrainian citizen wants to cross a ukrainian border control that citizen must talk only in ukrainian while foreign citizens can talk any . 
  a ) i find it interesting an `` american '' flagged user cares this much about ukranian border control laws that will never effect him .

   i dont like the whole `` there is no evidence , but we all know russia is doing it '' . 
  it 's a slippery slope . 
  it has come so far that people accuse russia everything . 
  from singlehandedly causing brexit to sending immigrants to europe . 
  nobody knows for sure , but lets say it publicly anyway . 
  so we are basically supporting the russian misinformation tactics . 
  i 'm curious , when the disinformation campaign tracks official russian news outlets with similar ( but not identical ) lines of attack with the same targets and its consistent with the firehose of falsehood model what evidence are you expecting beyond that , honestly , for it being a reasonable but unprovable suspicion ? 
  for instance , how do you know i 'm an american other than i told you ? 
  i have to ask you a non-rhetorical question ... do you genuinely believe trump realizes he has lost all credibility outside of the right-wing hardliners ? 
  the secret is in the us they have been doing this to you for awhile . 
  credit card companies and other private corporations censor speech on an international scale or you lose access to the us financial system 's most common form of payment .
