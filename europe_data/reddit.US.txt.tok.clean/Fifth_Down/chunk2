  i 've been a redditor for a longtime . 
  also i have very flexible hours and can cover a lot of late night time zones . 
  i 'm online pretty much all the time , except when i sleep daily usa just english i think it 's important to know what 's going on in the news cycle of other countries . 
  it gives one a good perspective on how much importance domestic problems are being given outside of your country , it also opens ones eyes to problems elsewhere in the world . 
  i 've always been the kind that is interested in news/international events , and world history . 
  favorite : it 's a place where i can find what europeans are thinking/feeling and their important news topics without having to deal with the european media who have since tailored their websites to give american ip addresses `` american '' tailored stories . 
  least favorite : this place is at best unpleasant for american flaired users , at worst it can be downright toxic . 
  i have no political leanings regarding europe which allows me to be truly impartial to a lot of the backlash against / r/europe mods who are often called out for pushing a particular political viewpoint . 
  i also believe that having an american mod will be a net benefit to this subreddit . 
  it is particularly large demographic that not only does n't have a clear voice , but also has a lot of hostility by users on here . 
  while this is a large european subreddit , it is also an american site , with a large american usership and having a healthy relationship between the two will help this place . 
  i 'm not the type to speak out on behalf of americans , i just do n't want to see the entire userbase get steamrolled . 
  nope i think megatreads if used incorrectly , can do a lot of damage to the discussion . 
  one of the ways in which they are used `` incorrectly '' is if a mod decides all new developments to the particular story can only be posted inside the megatread . 
  it hinders discussions , and buries important information . 
  new developments need their own thread , the megatread has it 's purposes at times , but it is not a tool that should be used to cover an entire topic . 
  megatreads are ideal when managing specific events . 
  the lack of tech experience , but i 'm a fast learner . 
  100 duck sized horses . 
  i 'd rather kick shit than get stomped on . 
  riot : pussy riot , they are european , and they teach us stuff, 
   this was the flag of the thirteen colonies pre-independence is n't the current french flag post revolutionary war ? 
  i 've seen other forums use `` possibly misleading '' for this kind of scenario . 
  much more easier for readers to understand what the mods mean in this situation . 
  we may but heads on defense issues from time to time . 
  but that does n't change the fact that fucking with an anglosphere nation is one of the quickest ways to piss off the us . 
   completely agree , why is an american a mod of / r/europe in the first place ? 
  i do n't come around this forum that often , but i do spend maybe five min a day just to see what 's up . 
  what i have noticed in that short amount of time is that to say the general atmosphere for american posters is uninviting is by far an understatement . 
  it would n't surprise me if americans made up a sizable portion of the daily traffic on here . 
  i do n't know anything about the op and if the mod in question is a dick get rid of him . 
  but please do n't use this as an excuse to prevent american mods . 
  given the circumstances it is n't unreasonable to have a guy watching out and making sure we do n't get totally steamrolled . 
  please let us have this . 
  it is not often that we get to be relevant in the soccer/football world . 
  their politics make europeans like us . 
  i 've seen it used for non-military and even non gov ' t groups . 
  not sure what the military standards are regarding it , but as far as i can tell it definitely is n't unique to them . 
  schools , boy scouts , fire departments , etc. 
  tend to have them . 
  they are purely ceremonial flags . 
  they are pretty common , but obviously not an everyday type flag . 
  i do n't think i have ever seen one being actually flown from a normal pole . 
   i could go on . 
  please do , 
  the funny part is we are only scratching the box on all the shit you need to learn to understand it . 
  actually no . 
  you are referring to this :  [ 2 ] a much rarer occurrence is the one-point safety , which can be scored by the offense on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt ; those have occurred at least twice in ncaa division i football since 1996 , most recently at the 2013 fiesta bowl . 
  no conversion safeties have occurred since at least 1940 in the nfl . 
  i was referring to this :  a conversion safety could also be scored by the defense in a score in college football ; although this has never occurred , ** it is the only possible way a team could finish with a single point in an american football game . 
  that is no different from a point after kick because only the offense can score that way . 
  the question was not `` can you score just one point '' but `` can a team have just 1 pt on the scoreboard '' in this scenario the ** defense ** has to score the safety for it to qualify . 
  2pt conversion are bonus plays which were meant to give a few extra points after the team scores . 
  the philosophy behind them is to not be major scoring plays . 
  thanks for that . 
  i had no idea if this was an upset or expected . 
  if you get a safety on a 2pt conversion your team gets a point . 
  one of those quirky things that only .001 % of football fans probably know . 
  and just an fyi to the europeans on here who need some context , you have a better chance of winning a bike race on foot than getting a safety on a 2pt conversion . 
  what exactly is your issue with american sniper ? 
  i 'm not defending the movie , i 'm just curious . 
  i like reading the news and seeing what issues are affecting our friends across the pond . 
  i also enjoy hearing what people think about us and how they perceive us as well . 
  lastly the best way to find out how important a domestic news story is , look at international news sources to see how much coverage it gets . 
  i used to go on bbc all the time but the growing `` americanization '' of the site and tailoring their articles based on location killed off all the reasons i went there , so now i spend more time on here . 
   the only uncolonised part was the north-west . 
  did n't russia have a noticeable presence there with fur traders ? 
  it 's a double edged sword . 
  while the media saves his campaign $ $ $ , his opponents have to spend $ $ $ in additional advertising because they ca n't match his media exposure . 
  so apparently  50 % of all nations are more hostile to us than serbia . 
  impressive ... 
  you keep citing other examples of nations under threat and ask why the us does nothing . 
  it 's pretty basic that the us does n't have a major alliance with those groups and it 's as simple as that . 
  you can cite all these situations , but it does nothing to the argument . 
  the us and israel have roughly the same amount of jewish population and combined they have 83 % of the world jewish population . 
  so that alone should stop these ridiculous comparisons . 
  plus the circumstances of the situation with world war ii and the founding of israel are also big factors on the american conscious that started this alliance in the first place . 
  the major dynamic of us politics is that there are two large generations . 
  the millennial generation ( born after 1981 ) which is larger than the baby boom generation ( born right after wwii ) , but it 's the baby boom generation that has massive voter turnout whereas the millennials have low voter turnout . 
  the generation in between is nicknamed the `` lost generation '' because it is much smaller and in between those two massive generations . 
  the baby boomers grew up in an era where their own politicians played a direct hand in creating israel , an era where there was considerable guilt regarding the holocaust , and came to know a much weaker israel who was being bullied by a number of other nations . 
  the millennials grew up in a world where israel has always been a first rate military power and see israel more as a bully and overreacts to said threats . 
  when the millennials overtake the baby boomers in political influence , clearly things will change . 
  as for the us and israel , that lobby exists because there is a threat , and our role in responding to said threat is debatable . 
  not only that , but the us is the only power where large amounts of israeli support is even possible , hence the reason the israel lobby ** has ** to not only exist here , but go `` all in '' because it 's the only card they have to play . 
  with the clock running out on their political hold , the lobby will only become more aggressive . 
  south korea is under threat , but there 's no `` sk lobby '' because we have troops on the dmz and it is n't a question as to our role there . 
  even if sk gets into a war with nk it 's pretty clear which side the world will be on . 
  japan is n't really under threat , but together with sk we recently started a `` pivot to asia '' in large part because we perceived those countries as under the most threat . 
  make no mistake about it . 
  the israel lobby does n't signify that the us cares considerably more for them than the uk . 
  it only highlights the complexity , seriousness , and uniqueness of that situation . 
  on top of that , i 'm sure israel does whatever it can to facilitate the movement within the united states which i doubt the uk does . 
  the us will go to the same lengths to protect other countries at any given time , you just wo n't see us do it unless there is a similar situation at play . 
   the great united states needing little britain to help him out , funny . 
  i seriously doubt the us military 's ability to conduct operations is `` make or break '' dependent on uk support . 
  has it ever occurred to you that the us simply wanted to avoid the mistakes of iraq by being both the political & military driving force behind such an event and simply needed bipartisanship ? 
  it 's like a game of `` heads i win , tails you lose '' because regardless of what we do you find a way to criticize us . 
  you compare israel to the uk but omit a critical detail . 
  israel is under threat , and have to deal with said threat on a regular basis .
