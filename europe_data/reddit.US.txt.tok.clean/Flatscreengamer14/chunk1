  good ol cousin fucking mississippi, 
  italy and greece i think are right . 
  but seriously spain . 
  over pablo fucking picasso . 
  also churchill over newton and shakesphere . 
  and charles fucking de gaulle over napoleon , the guy that shaped europe for 200 years after his reign . 
  as for germany , i would have gone with bismark or einstein ( nietzsche and frederick the great in the top 5 as well ) . 
  also i 'd go with van gough over william the orange for the netherlands . 
  the ultimate mega evil is the jew kyle brovflowski, 
  that explains the daywalker kyle, 
  well remember , you have nato on your side , finland does n't .

  should n't you finish fighting your other rival first ( the sea ) ? 
  `` let 's start ww1 again '' . 
  technically they still win . 
  it 's just that this is n't something most people want to win . 
  fair point . 
  and will do . 
  i have started reading up on spain post napoleon . 
  that being said a lot of europe was chaotic . 
  france had 2 revolutions , a coup , and embarrassing defeat against prussia . 
  but i will admit spain probably faired the worst so i 'll give you that . 
  i 'll admit beating spain at the time was n't that great of an accomplishment . 
  it was still a victory and was a major blow to an already weak empire . 
  19th century , and it 's not like we were the superpower we today if we even were one yet . 
  we were mostly isolated from european politics unless it happened in the americas . 
  we were on our way up , it 's not like spain was fighting britain or the german empire who were the 2 major powers in europe and the world . 
  also if you think no country can self destruct like spain , we elected donald fucking trump . 
  checkmate !, 
  i knew kierkgaard ( dunno if i spelt that right ) but i did n't remember the sculptor . 
  i got quite a bit of history right but not much about the gov ' t ( i guessed 4 years for elections instead of 5 ) .
