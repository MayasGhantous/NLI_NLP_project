that is kind of sad . 
  it is a great city . 
  i am looking for a serious answer . 
  it is no secret that sweden 's government has basically shut down any opposition of their `` let everyone in '' immigration policy . 
  i am just curious to see how regular swedes are taking to this considering recent events . 
  keep in mind , that immigration is fine as long as it is done in a ** controlled ** manner and the people that are let in can properly integrate into the host country . 
  it also has to be at the consent of the people of the host country for it to work . 
  i am curious . 
  i do not live in sweden so i am not entirely sure of what the real public attitudes are there . 
  the impression that i have gotten from many media reports are that sweden is pretty hard core for more immigration and are scared to death of ever being perceived as `` intolerant '' . 
  i am guessing from your statement that is not entirely true . 
  what are the attitudes of people you know about this whole migrant thing ? 
  plus , they assume everyone is a refugee , when that has clearly been shown not to be the case . 
  i think the cost would be worth it . 
   the united states , in comparison , has no statutory minimum . 
  that is not a good thing . 
  that is pretty much the way to do it . 
  hungary is great . 
  i ca n't wait to go back . 
  i hear people compare chicago and new york , and i always hear that chicago is like a clean version of ny . 
  granted , i have never been to ny so i can not speak from experience . 
  i do live in the chicago area and i can say the parts that a tourist would have any interest in seeing are generally very nice . 
  the bad parts are far away from the touristy parts , and there is really no reason to go to the bad parts anyway . 
  what places did you go to , just out of curiosity ? 
  how cute , the un is acting like it is important again . 
  it would help actual syrian refugees get their applications through faster , as germany would n't be so bogged down with fake applicants . 
  the fakes should absolutely be reported . 
   i find it shocking that there have been 30 explosions in malmo this year alone !!, 
  that is absolutely crazy !!, 
  i find this absolutely mind boggling . 
  that crap would never fly in the us , and sweden thinks that with enough love and hugs , everyone will become friends . 
  it just completely blows my mind on how completely insane most of sweden 's leaders are . 
  it is really like they are all on drugs or something . 
  i kind of feel like sweden is to blame for its own problems on this issue . 
  if you are going to become `` sweden , no '' do n't just dump your migrants into finland . 
  why do n't you just deport some of the people who clearly are not in need of dire help ? 
  probably should have thought of that before opening the floodgates . 
  oh look , it is an ec finger wagger . 
  in a perfect world he would have a real job . 
  nobody cares what he thinks . 
  this is an interesting development . 
  it is astonishing that the ec is doing something reasonable about the situation . 
  i wonder if this will actually change anything . 
  why should greenland have to take care of them ? 
  so the solution is to just let everyone in the world in ? 
  you know most of the people coming to europe illegally are not from syria right ? 
  having hundreds of thousands of people coming in from terror hotspots unchecked is colossally stupid policy . 
  good for the czech republic . 
  i am glad some countries have the balls to stand up to merkel and her insanity . 
  this is a very reasonable solution . 
   un warns ... that 's where is stopped reading . 
  when i was in greece , a lot of people mistook me for being greek . 
  if it were up to me , europe would have better external border control in the first place . 
  there is no problem in helping out * real * refugees , but too many of these people are ** not ** refugees . 
  why is n't greece shipping these people back to turkey ? 
  turkey is a safe country . 
  from there , just help turkey weed out the people who are not refugees send them home . 
  then ( if the host country wants ) , allow a reasonable number of refugees to come . 
   this `` only 20 % '' trope is becoming troublesome . 
  it 's an excuse and an attempt to paint asylum seekers as economic migrants in order to justify doing nothing . 
   everyone just reconsider the 20 % statistic . 
  did problems elsewhere in the world cease ? 
  did wars and famine stop in iraq , afghanistan , somalia , or eritrea ? 
  there are still refugees arriving from elsewhere . 
  it does n't mean they are entitled to go to europe . 
  europe does n't have the resources to take in endless refugees from everywhere . 
  also , a lot of these people ** are ** economic migrants . 
  i do n't consider someone who passed over many safe countries in order to go to germany or sweden as a `` refugee '' . 
   will half a million syrians arriving in germany stop people from trying to minimize the syrian refugee crisis ? 
  a lot of these people coming in are not syrian . 
   will it finally shut up those countries embarrassed by their own paltry refugee intakes ? 
  i do n't think very many countries are embarrassed by their small refugee intakes . 
  do you have numbers on germany 's current deportation rates ? 
   who do you think you are ? 
  country shoppers . 
  they want that sweet german welfare money . 
  sadly , i expect this kind of idiocy from the swedish green party . 
  that party is a mental disorder . 
  i wonder how many of these are really children . 
  i think the problem increasingly is n't with eastern europeans , but the absurdly lax immigration standards from many western european countries . 
  europe is an amazing continent that is a mosaic of different cultures and customs . 
  the standard of living is very good in most places . 
  europe has some of the best countries on earth . 
  the eu is a bloated mess that seems to want to be another usa , but does n't seem to realize that the countries that make it up are too different to federalize into one entity at this time ( especialy considering only one or two countries seem to be calling all the shots ) . 
  i am in no way a fan of the eu in its current form . 
  you have got to be kidding me . 
  what do you think he deserves ? 
  a hug and a cookie ? 
  eritrea is a bad place , i get that . 
  nigeria has stable areas to the south and somalia has relatively stable areas in somaliland ( which i think more countries should give more recognition to ) . 
  even in the case of legitimate asylum seekers , it has to be done through legal channels . 
  brining in unlimited numbers of people like this is recipe for disaster . 
  most of the people making the crossing are n't libyan , and a lot have gone to libya despite the chaos there just to make the crossing . 
  i say rescue them , then send them straight home . 
  edit : spelling, 
  most of them would n't even be * making * the crossing if they knew the italian coat guard was n't going to give them a free ride to europe once they entered international waters . 
  the skyrocketing number of crossings once mare nostrum was put into effect was no coincidence . 
  keep in mind that people have been going to libya in droves to attempt the crossing . 
  all this is doing is giving human traffickers a field day . 
  as much as i can not stand merkel , this is n't her doing .
