  put migrant camps in countries outside europe and keep them there until they can be sent home or given asylum in a country outside europe . 
  make it * very * clear that people coming by boat will ** never ** be allowed entry into europe . 
  the people who go about the asylum process ** legally ** should be the only ones allowed to get european asylum . 
   you still need to screen them ( and of course , they could be really refugees help refugees , fine , but bring them in a controlled and vetted manner . 
  economic migrants should be sent home . 
   as of now , we do n't have an agreement with any third country . 
  is not that easy if europe were serious about stopping this they would make a deal with someone . 
  australia did it . 
   considering mare nostrum was established after a tragedy in which hundreds of migrants died , i doubt so oh , i think so . 
  the migrant numbers skyrocketed after the start of mare nostrum . 
  rescuing the migrants and sending them somewhere that is n't europe will make anyone else think twice about wasting the time and money about making the journey themselves . 
  this `` send the migrants to europe '' mission had unarguably made the situation so much worse than it ever needed to be . 
  the vast majority of the migrants are n't originally from libya . 
  yep . 
  not refugees . 
  rescue them and send them straight home , or to a third country reception center until they can be sent home . 
  i guarantee the number of people attempting the journey would plummet . 
  if they knew they were going to be sent home , and that talking a rickety boat to just outside libyan territorial waters would not result in a free trip to europe , they would n't attempt to go in the first place , and human traffickers would go out of business there . 
  italys migrant importation program started in 2013 with their stupid `` mare nostrum '' program . 
  anyone with half a brain knew this would start a massive pull factor from the get go . 
  i urge the un to stfu . 
  the other countries do n't want to be overrun with migrants . 
  the problem in greece has been more or less getting better . 
  the one in italy is getting worse thanks to idiot politicians in that country who do n't really want to solve the crisis at all , just spread it to other countries . 
  more european money . 
  they are n't closing anything . 
  it 's all an empty threat so they can continue to fund their ferry service . 
  well , soros is kind of awful . 
  they are n't going to bar anything . 
  i feel like this is an empty threat to get more money for their migrant importing program . 
  it wo n't stop merkel and her henchmen from trying to force them on poland and the other v4 counties even though it was her that wanted the migrants in the first place . 
  germany and company has handled this migrant crisis terribly , and they want counties that had nothing to do with the tidal wave of migrants coming in to take on their mess . 
  i hope the v4 stands strong against them . 
  thanks merkel !, 
  why were they even allowed back * in * to europe ? 
  any isis fighting should be grounds for immediate stripping of eu citizenship . 
  france has the right idea of just killing them where they fester in the middle east . 
  no trials or second chances , just kill the isis fuckers . 
  italy created their own problem . 
  if they go down the shitter they can thank their politicians for that . 
  pdi needs to get ousted . 
  that is a really good question . 
  they should be tried and punished as war criminals . 
  if europe had to take in everyone from every shitty country in the world they would be completely overrun . 
  you have to prioritize . 
  not everyone can live in europe . 
  the most arrivals are from guinea so far . 
  that 's funny , i do n't recall it being an active war zone . 
  it 's a shitty place to live no doubt , but i do n't think they are in need of asylum . 
  the oecd can go fuck themselves . 
  maybe they should n't come to germany in the first place . 
  germany is n't a charity . 
  talk is cheap . 
  do it already . 
  northern cyprus is only recognized by one country , turkey . 
  good for france . 
  the really old smaller denomination euro coins had al of the europe countries , but they were separated from one another . 
  it looked kind of messy . 
  having the full continent on is better . 
   it sucks so much that both cities have gotten the olympics before yes !, 
  i really wanted budapest to get these games before they dropped out of the running . 
  i suppose i am happy my country is getting an olympics again though , and i 'm happy paris is getting another one . 
  paris has n't had one in a very long time . 
  also wtf is up with beijing getting the 2022 winter games so soon after hosting the 2008 summer games ? 
  i was rooting for almaty all the way . 
  let 's let someone who has n't hosted have a shot at hosting . 
  it would be our 5th summer games . 
  st. louis hosted once in 1904 , la twice before in 1932 and 1984 , and then atlanta . 
  la 2028 would be 5 . 
  the migrant `` rescue '' mission is creating a massive pull factor . 
  time to change the laws so the australian solution is an option . 
  i wonder if border security will ever be take this seriously . 
  how can you defend the eu with such wide open borders ? 
  i would think people could remember czechoslovenia . 
  warm summers are n't unusual in siberia . 
  i envy moscows weather . 
  i love new mexico 's flag , and i have to say that the union flag on the canton of hawaii 's flag is a neat touch . 
  yep . 
  in one of my vacation pictures from st. petersburg i had a car in the shot ( the car was n't intentional ) that had y on the plate . 
  i was curious especially about y since the cyrillic version looks like '' \u0423 '' as oppposed to our `` y '' . 
  iirc the y on russian plates does look more like '' \u0423 '' . 
  3d effect ? 
  i love seeing different us plates . 
  sometimes you encounter the rare alaska or hawaii plate . 
  we here in illinois just changed our plates , and they look pretty decent . 
  come on , at least have a * little * fun with it . 
  edit : geez , what 's with all the downvotes ? 
  seems like everyone is taking their run-of-the-mill standard issue european plates a bit too seriously here . 
  let idaho have it , they do n't really have anything else . 
  our state flag designs are ridiculous . 
  most of them are the blue field with the state seal on it . 
  that is boring . 
  at least some states like maryland and arizona have neat flags . 
  it is fun to see a completely different plate on a car from another state , especially if they had just changed their plate recently . 
  some of our plate designs are pretty nice too . 
  it would be pretty badass if european countries did the same thing , and had completely different designs ( with the same general format ) for each country . 
  i imagine finland would have a beautiful blue plate with swans or something . 
  you guys have nice national colors/symbols . 
  interesting thing about russian plates is that they only use letters that are found in * both * cyrillic and latin alphabets . 
  that 's means only the letters a , b , c , e , h , k , m , o , p , t , x , and y would appear on a russian license plate .
