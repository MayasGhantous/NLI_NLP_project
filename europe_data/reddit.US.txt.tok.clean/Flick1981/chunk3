  most of them are n't libyan . 
  i went to the czech republic a couple of years ago . 
  it is a really neat place with amazing old architecture . 
  this article is not too clear . 
  154 out of how many ? 
  154 out of thousands is not much of an improvement . 
  plus , what are they going to do with the rejected refugees ? 
  i know most of europe is n't real big on forcible deportation so what does all of this really mean exactly ? 
  i hate the idea for the exact reason that you do . 
  europe is a mosaic of different cultures and values , and to see that go away would be a real shame . 
  what would it be replaced with ? 
  a monolithic united states of europe ? 
  why would anyone want that ? 
  europe has some of the richest and happiest countries in the world so i 'm not quite getting the economic standpoint . 
  who cares if china has a bigger economy ? 
  most of the people there would kill to have your lifestyle . 
  it feels like the idea of a `` united states of europe '' is just a veiled power grab from some of the larger counties in the eu . 
  whether the british public wants to stay in the eu or not is really none of our business . 
  obama needs to stay the fuck out of this . 
  it would be nice if politicians would stay out of other countries affairs . 
  that 's because most european countries do n't seem to * want * to deport anyone . 
  at some point , you have to stop being nice . 
  ** only ** six years ? 
  this should be considered treason . 
  i am sure denmark is devistated that he is pulling his exhibit . 
  danes have bigger problems to worry about than what some dopey artist says . 
  what kinds of people join these anarchist groups ? 
  are these people with not enough to do ? 
  are they bored college kids ? 
  radical leftists ? 
  how does any sane adult think that what these groups are advocating is a good idea ? 
  i have a feeling these punks would be the first ones to run away if there was any sign of * real * trouble , yet they thrive on advocating anarchy and causing their own trouble . 
  it 's likely because it is winter . 
  they are saying it will start back up in a couple of months . 
  these migrants need to leave . 
  they are not refugees , and they are not fleeing oppression . 
  they deserve nothing . 
  this program actually sounds like something sensible coming from the german government for once . 
  i am actually kind of surprised to hear about it . 
  i wonder how successful it will be as the year goes on . 
  giving people real incentives to start families will alleviate it though . 
  if europe does n't do something fast , this will happen . 
  it 's too bad that so few leaders over there are actually doing anything about the migrant crisis . 
  it 's like most of the leaders there are just willing to roll over and let their countries be overrun . 
  that is no way to run a country . 
  no wonder people are angry . 
  who cares ? 
  if the offending country in question was at all worried about being a good ally it would take its citizens back when the host country did n't want them . 
  the host country does n't need to be giving aid to countries that do n't respect their sovereignty . 
  if they wo n't take back their citizens just threaten to cut off aid . 
  that will change a lot of attitudes real quick . 
  is there anyone in the csu/cdu that is not a lunatic that they can run instead ? 
  why does it have to be merkel in particular ? 
  i 've been to the hermitage . 
  it has an incredible art collection . 
  that place is massive , and the history behind it is fascinating . 
  ireland is trying to deport him , not execute him . 
  deportation is not a breach of human rights . 
  my compassion for islamic fundamentalists is at zero . 
  no country should have them . 
  the fact that they stopped the deportation an ** isis recruiter ** just highlights what a joke the echr is . 
  it is so obvious this guy is just saying anything to stay in europe . 
  what a bunch of suckers that group is . 
  how do individual european countries not resent this ? 
  the czech republic is a fantastic country . 
  i wish you guys continued success . 
  so what does this mean ? 
  did italy actually forcibly deport them or did they just send them a harshly worded letter saying they had to leave in the hopes they would actually do so ? 
  that is unbelievably irresponsible for a government to do . 
  i know the swedish government has some morbid fear of ever seeming `` intolerant '' , but come on . 
  translation : the eu 's afraid their power tripping ways are about to become obsolete . 
  i hope they do it . 
  fuck saudi arabia . 
   they should be handled as unlawful combatants . 
  you got intel ? 
  you eliminate the threat preemptively . 
  perhaps guantanamo bay is a nessecary evil in a world of suicide bombers . 
  the police ca n't fight wars this may very well be necessary . 
  i am of the belief that guantanamo bay is a necessary evil as well . 
  good luck with that . 
  you might get a finger wagging from mutti merkel . 
  who is surprised by this ? 
  the eu is chock full of pathetic wieners running that organization . 
  no wonder the uk wants out . 
  i hope more countries follow suit . 
  the powers that be at the eu all take part in one big feel-good circle-jerk while the borders are wide open for anyone to just walk right in . 
  absolutely . 
  i would like to see an atomic bomb dropped on those fuckers . 
  no , i am not being facetious . 
  good . 
  religion has no place in schools anywhere . 
  islam is n't a race . 
  `` intellectual '', 
  polands primary responsibility is to its citizens , not tens of thousands of illegal immigrants . 
  if that is not how they want to spend their money , that is their prerogative . 
  seriously . 
  they need to stop feeling apologizing for things they themselves did n't even do . 
  it was 70 years ago . 
  every country has atrocities in the past . 
  move on .
