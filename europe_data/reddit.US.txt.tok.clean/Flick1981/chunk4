  good . 
  they should n't be getting bullied by the eu . 
  best : the city is beautiful . 
  worst : public transportation is sporadic in spots . 
  winter ? 
  in * europe * ?!, 
  who could have foreseen this madness ? 
  you have a nice flag . 
  do n't be afraid to display it . 
  be proud of it . 
   that is rich coming from an american . 
  it was the usa who destabilized the whole region by invading multiple country . 
  and it was the usa who helped creating isis . 
  yeah , just because i am an american does n't mean i support anything we are doing in the middle east . 
  quite the opposite actually . 
  i am vehemently opposed to having the us having anything more to do with the middle east . 
  the us has done a fantastic job fucking things up there . 
  a * lot * of americans are pretty pissed that we have little to no say as to what the government does in that region . 
   german defence minister ursula von der leyen said europe needed to work together to come up with a solution to the crisis but that germany would continue to welcome refugees . 
  please help clean up our mess !, 
  we are going to keep making it worse though . 
  yep , you would think that syrians would be the first to trumpet more border control . 
  all of the fake `` syrians '' coming in to europe are creating a huge backlog , which means much longer wait times for legitimate refugees . 
  i wish europe had the death penalty . 
  i would say just execute them , but i know europe frowns on that sort of thing , so this is a good alternative . 
  these are n't six year olds . 
  if someone is willing to join isis , they are already beyond help . 
  you , i like you . 
  okay , then do it . 
  why wait ? 
  sadly , i fully expect them to be idiots . 
  she * is * the problem . 
  what the fuck is going on in germany ? 
  has everyone in charge lost their minds ? 
   how about finally finding a european solution and protecting the european borders instead of wasting lots of money on building fences within the european union ... ? 
  nanny merkel wo n't allow that . 
  she really thinks she is queen of europe now does n't she ? 
  she ca n't get booted out of power soon enough . 
  she is criminally irresponsible . 
  good . 
  denmark should be a model for this sort of thing . 
   just because they are capable of such violence does n't mean they deserve to go back to a warzone and die . 
  they do n't deserve asylum in a rich western european country either . 
   if you send them away , they 'll radicalise further and tyrannise the local population . 
  here they can be educated , even just by example , by being forced to see people of many different cultures living side-by-side in peace . 
  they are perfectly capable of being radicalized in europe too . 
  look at how many isis nuts * came from europe * . 
  if someone wants to subscribe to that kind of ideology seeing others `` living side-by-side in peace '' wo n't do much . 
   even if you 've decided to send them away , where do you send them to ? 
  ** they often do n't have passports ** and syria is a warzone . 
  no passport , no entry . 
   few nations are looking ** to harbour radical islamists , ** ** no ** country should be doing that . 
  europe needs to stop worrying about `` moral superiority '' and start worrying about its * own citizens * first and foremost . 
  have * some * standards on who you let in . 
  radical islamists ** do n't ** want to integrate no matter how much nice nice eurocrats want to throw at them . 
  helping true refugees is great , but have some standards on who you let in . 
  nobody should have to deal with isis nuts jobs in their country . 
  merle 's has been anything * but * helpful in this whole mess . 
  eastern europe does not want migrants in their country . 
  that is their right . 
  every country should have the right to protect its borders . 
  frontex is useless . 
  who woulda though ? 
  or just a * tad * to he left . 
  this will end well . 
  nobody else in the cdu/csu that can do the job ? 
   ` let everyone in , no control ' this is pretty much happening right now . 
  this woman has turned the crazy up to 45 . 
  is there any way germany can boot her out of office before the next election ? 
  she really does n't seem to care at all about what a mess this situation will leave her country in if it does n't get put under control real fast . 
  what does she think her stance will accomplish ? 
  brownie points from the un ? 
  it really looks like she is becoming more and more unhinged as this goes on . 
  angela merkel is a real bitch . 
  she needs to be taken down a couple dozen notches . 
  but merkel said that this can go on forever and ever , how could this be ? 
  i like this . 
  estonia and finland . 
  this sounds like something renzi would do . 
  yeah , all i had to do was get a visa online , print it , and get it stamped along with my ( us ) passport . 
  turkey is a pretty cool place . 
   you mean they disagree with the right wing extremists the thing is , is that the sd party is the only ones addressing immigration at all , with the rest of the political parties running scared and shutting down any debate at all . 
  considering the fact that the sd is gaining support , i am beginning to think that more and more swedes are growing weary of the swedish government 's extremely lax immigration policy . 
  from what i have read , sweden 's immigration policy has been a complete failure . 
  they are letting far too many people in within a short amount of time , and many of the people who come have little desire to assimilate to the swedish culture . 
  would you say this was an accurate assessment ? 
  how will finland ** ever ** recover from this ? 
  who did n't see this coming ? 
  i went to tallinn a few years ago . 
  what an amazing place . 
  i got a winter hat from a stand there . 
  i 'm so ready for this in chicago . 
  they have a home . 
  it is n't france . 
  i do n't think they should be left to die , but bringing them all to europe sends the wrong message . 
  send them to a third country and make it clear that from now on , attempting to get to europe by boat will ensure that the person will * never * be allowed in . 
  that will stop all of this real quick . 
  i know how it works . 
  most of them try to leave italy for places with better welfare programs as soon as they can . 
  the countries they try to flee to have said enough is enough ( even * sweden * ) .
