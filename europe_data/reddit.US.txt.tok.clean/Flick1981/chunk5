  that is why more and more of them are `` stuck '' in italy , and why renzi is throwing a little fit . 
  i realize that people want to go to europe for a whole host of reasons . 
  there are ** millions ** who want to do that . 
  do you want to take them * all * in ? 
  a large percentage of the migrants are working aged men , you got ta stop with the tired `` women and children '' narrative . 
  plus , most of the people * would n't even be making the journey * if they knew a free ride to europe was n't only a few miles away . 
  forced to take ? 
  they are deliberately seeking these boats out in international waters and bringing them * all the way to europe * . 
  they are basically giving them a free ride all the way there . 
  please stop with this narrative . 
  a large portion of these people are working aged men . 
  these people would not be making the dangerous journey in the first place if they knew a free ride to europe was n't a short distance away . 
  i know about that story . 
  that is not the same thing as deliberately searching out every migrant boat and bringing them to europe . 
  it 's not against the law for italy to stop seeking out every migrant boat and brining them to italy . 
  they are doing a lot of the rescues * at * libyan waters ... on the border . 
  the do n't enter the waters themselves . 
  they would n't be making the journey if they knew italy was n't going to rescue them . 
  nobody is forcing italy to go right on * libyan * territorial waters to pick up migrants . 
  a lot of italy 's problems with migrants are of their own making . 
  renzi 's government willfully imported hundreds of thousands of them and now he wants everyone else to take care of his problem ? 
  what a dick . 
  do you understand just how many people want to get into europe ? 
  i do n't think there is enough money in the world to fund this sort of thing . 
  less people would attempt the journey in the first place if italy was n't right there to be their free taxi service . 
  there is a reason the numbers of migrants skyrocketed in 2014 . 
  it has to do with their mare nostrum program that they have been running since then ( even though it supposedly `` ended '' a while ago ) . 
   `` italy can not take another year like the one we 've just had , '' renzi said during the recording of a talk show . 
  he said the flow of arrivals must be curbed by ** march ** , without saying what would happen if it was not limited . 
  why is he waiting until march to do something about this ? 
  this sounds like an empty threat . 
  that is their choice . 
  the concrete jungle is part of what gives warsaw its own `` charm '' so to speak . 
  it 's unusual for a large capital in the eu . 
  prague and budapest are gorgeous cities , but for the cold war buff in me , i could n't help be be fascinated by the mix of modern skyscrapers and gray communist era structures . 
  the underground concrete mall underneath the central train station area was something to behold as well . 
  the old town was not `` authentic '' like you would see in other european capitals , but it was neat nonetheless . 
  you are right about amsterdam . 
  english is spoken everywhere . 
  i went there in 2007 and was new to the whole traveling thing . 
  after first going to london ( where i knew everyone spoke english ) , then paris ( where english was much harder to find ) , then brussels ( mixed bag ) , i was amazed at how well * everyone * seemed to speak english there . 
  i was also amazed at how unbelievably friendly everyone was there . 
  i enjoyed barcelona as well . 
  never went to the beach though ( lived in florida when i visited spain , so i did n't see a need . 
  i 'm not a beach person anyway ) . 
  fwiw i really liked warsaw when i went . 
  it has its own unique charm to it . 
  the palace of culture and science is one of my favorite in europe , and the cbd is one of the most impressive on the continent . 
  sure the old town is a replica , but it sure is neat looking . 
  the pierogis are delicious too . 
  true , but hosting the winter games is just as big an honor . 
  i would n't be opposed to paris getting the games in 2024 . 
  i would just be interested in seeing someone who has n't done it before do it . 
  i sure wish kazakhstan got the 2022 winter games over beijing ( who just had an olympics ) . 
  yes there were . 
  the next ones were in 94 ( 2 year gap ) then every 4 years after . 
  i am pulling for budapest honestly . 
  every other country running for the games has had them fairly recently if you count winter games as well . 
  hungary has never had them . 
  i like to see new countries get hosting duties . 
  prove what ? 
  that italy is breaking the law by not registering migrants ? 
  that is a provision in the dublin agreement . 
  that countries are going to step up border controls ? 
  it looks like it is already happening . 
  austria was about ready to really ramp things up earlier this year until renzi threw a fit and finally promised he would control the migrants in italy . 
  i know france guards vulnerable points at their italian border as well . 
  no , it is absurd . 
  italy should not deem itself responsible for every rickety boat in the mediterranean . 
  that is ridiculous . 
  italy created the `` high risk '' area with its stupid program . 
  at the edge of * libyan border waters * ?!, 
  that is just absurd to go that far . 
  that would mean italy is breaking the law . 
  they * have * to be registered in the first country they land in . 
  yeah , definitely watch border countries step up border patrols . 
  say good bye to schengen as we know it . 
  watch for border checkpoints in the bordering countries . 
  if italy brings them in , they should have to keep them . 
  i hate this argument . 
  if the italian coast guard was n't out bringing everyone to europe , not as many people would be making the journey . 
  the migrant problem started spiraling out of control when italy started their idiotic migrant taxi service back in 2013 . 
  simply state that whoever tries to get to europe via boat will * never * get residency there . 
  no exceptions . 
  rescue them , then send them straight home ( or to a third country that will take them if need be ) . 
  if the migrants country refuses to take them back , withdraw all financial support of the said country . 
  he has been doing a miserable job of it so far . 
  you do n't stop illegal immigration by * bringing them in * . 
  i wish we could get rid of summer here in the us . 
  to me it does n't seem like much is being done in libya at all . 
  the migrant crisis there is worse now than it was at this point last year . 
  are they anywhere close to stopping the flow of migrants there ? 
  the laws are not practical . 
  a country 's first priority is to its citizens , not endless streams of unvetted migrants from who-knows-where . 
  ok , then why do n't you just take all of them then . 
  no need to force your silly ideals on the rest of europe , especially with the countries that simply do not want any more migrants . 
  i bet all of those migrants will take kindly to her feminist ideals too . 
  more like time to change the laws . 
  maybe if italy stopped coming to everyone 's rescue , perhaps fewer people would attempt the journey in the first place . 
  tell germany and france to go fuck themselves if they complain .
