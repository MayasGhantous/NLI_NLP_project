  they are n't run by barbarians . 
  why does the new yorker care so much ? 
   what you do n't seem to understand is that without the eu there is no `` europe '' as such . 
  just like there is no `` america '' as in the continent consisting of north - and south-america operating in a common interest . 
  there is a united states of america maintaining prosperity for all of its member-states , a level of which could not be attained by any of the individual states . 
  the eu is nothing like the us . 
  this brings me to the question as to why people want a federated europe . 
  have you seen how the us is run ? 
  it 's an absolute mess . 
  i live here , and with a country this large , good luck ever getting anything done . 
  too many differing opinions tends to get extremely polarizing . 
  yes we have prosperity , but the individual quality of life here can range from fantastic to third-world . 
   if you take the eu out of europe you will eventually fall back to a number of individual states sharing nothing but a geographical continent and a heap of bureaucracy overshadowing their trade connections . 
  you can have a region that has deep trade connections without the eus overbearing nature . 
  many areas of the world have that . 
  if we were to enter into another cold war it would happen regardless if there was an eu or not , but i think nato ( as much as i think that needs as overhaul ) would be sufficient in stopping that from happening . 
   a new war in europe i do n't see this happening . 
  europe is much too different than it was 75 years ago . 
  europe is already in the us sphere of influence for the most part . 
  i think europe is perfectly capable of stability and prosperity without the eu overlooking everything . 
   my opinion is that europe is doomed without eu why ? 
  you do n't think europe can be a nice place without the eu in charge ? 
   there are deals with libya gaining momentum already i have been hearing this for a while now . 
  is anything substantive coming from these talks ? 
  all i have been seeing is a bunch of dawdling by the eu on the libya front . 
  because germany said so . 
  it is the eu way . 
  you have slovenia . 
  you were both in yugoslavia and now you are both in the eu . 
  good . 
  classtime is not a time for prayer . 
  do that on your own time . 
  i have a ton of different countries . 
  i do n't live in europe but i go there a lot . 
   if only sweden had embraced its own values and culture , instead of embracing anti-nationalism and welcoming hundreds of thousands of people who hate western civilization ... that is the real problem with sweden . 
  they have good values on paper , but the fact that there seems to be so much shame in being `` swedish '' there , and the fact that they allow in so many people whose beliefs are antithetical to western liberal ideals will create enormous problems for that country in the future . 
  sweden could learn a ** lot ** from denmark . 
  this is pretty powerful stuff . 
  you forget how bad it really was on the other side of the iron curtain . 
  they are probably crying and apologizing as we speak . 
  do you have numbers on actual deportations in europe ? 
  i want to see a brexit because the eu in its current form is just awful . 
  i do n't know why a country as strong as the uk would want to be in a group where germany seems to be calling all the shots these days . 
   those undeserving of asylum are out fast that is assuming that people rejected for asylum * actually leave * . 
  from what i understand , a lot of europe is n't real good at actually deporting people ( that does n't mean kindly asking them to leave ) . 
  i 'm not sure if switzerland is different in that regard , but i am guessing not so much . 
  it is so ridiculous . 
  that really is their mentality . 
  they act as if their european values will save the world , when in reality , nobody seems to give a damn about these values outside the western world . 
  europe has become dangerously na\u00efve . 
  what are these amnesty groups problem ? 
  do they not realize the danger of letting thousands upon thousands of unvetted people from terror hotspots ? 
  how can people be so damn stupid ? 
  i understand some people need legitimate help , but theses amnesty groups want to let ** everyone ** in , and do n't seem to understand the consequences of that . 
  they are deranged . 
  i bet these people will never get deported either . 
   two of my closest friends are middle eastern . 
  i 'd go as far to say they are both more culturally swedish than i am . 
  one did a 3 year stint in the army and is very patriotic , sometimes a bit embarrassingly so . 
  this is good to hear . 
  it sounds like they are assimilating well to sweden . 
  the country ** is ** in ruins . 
  we should have just left qadaffi alone and not gotten involved . 
  he was a bad guy , but places like libya need force to keep it functioning . 
  messing around in areas like that tend to make it worse . 
  let 's not forget what a disaster iraq has been . 
  i 'm aware of frontex . 
  perhaps when the eu stops letting in hundreds of thousands of people from terrorist hotspots completely unvetted i will take it more seriously . 
  libya has been a complete disaster . 
  isis has created strongholds there , and the entire country is in chaos . 
  the new `` government '' seems completely toothless as of right now , and the place has become an illegal immigrant flood gate . 
  libya is absolutely not better off than it was before nato decided to intervene . 
  if european countries were to band together and actually make a viable defense force , i think they could take on russia on their own . 
  sure , the us can help as we would help any ally like japan or south korea if they were attacked , but nato is antiquated and unnecessary in my opinion . 
  as someone from a world superpower , i would rather have a small globally small government like luxembourgs . 
  at least perhaps my government then would at least slightly give a shit about us . 
   one border control i 'll believe that when i see it . 
  the schengen zone barely has border control as it is . 
  i feel like the libya fiasco is a prime example of why nato should be disbanded . 
  the ussr is gone , and now we are just using it to intervene where we should n't . 
  i think it is time for europe to start creating its own defenses . 
  they are n't danish citizens . 
  they should n't have to be denmark 's responsibility . 
  i hope the uk has the sense to leave this neurotic organization . 
  hopefully others will follow the uk out . 
  this is just weird rhetoric . 
  is the eu some kind of unholy cult now ? 
  how about just let countries decide to stay or go without the dramatics . 
  the netherlands should just deport them on their own . 
  not everything the us does is bad . 
  the eu should just cut off all aid for any country not willing to take back its illegal immigrants . 
  this is the belgian government we are talking about . 
  just be lucky they did n't sentence him to a ten minute `` time out '' . 
  i want to know why he was only sentenced to five years in prison . 
  what the hell is that ? 
  it is n't . 
  merkel is just a lunatic . 
  god forbid people feel pride in their country or anything . 
  they can start by not letting anyone with a pulse into the country . 
  sweden 's immigration policy is a total joke .
