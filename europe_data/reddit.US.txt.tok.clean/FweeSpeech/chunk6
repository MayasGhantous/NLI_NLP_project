  they can still operate in turkey for non-violent activity . 
   if you are going to harp on christians for a small group in africa , you ca n't give a pass to the literal millions of muslims who support the same exact behavior . 
  i 'm not giving them a pass . 
  i 'm just saying women going to a water park as a womens-only event with a muslim-style dress code is ok and then we went on a huge tangent . 
  look , honestly , i am tired of replying to someone who is trying to win through endurance and statement . 
  but the disproportionate coverage for terrorism leads to ppl thinking it matters than it does . 
   when we are talking about sharia we are talking about a system of law that says gays must be executed , i just pointed out they got laws for the first one passed in africa and were ultimately forced to settle for `` just '' imprisoning them when they got called out by the us media domestically . 
  so i think at this point you are just being willfully ignorant since you brought up the same point again . 
  you clearly are n't willing to admit reality happened so i give up . 
   so all your points are either a complete misrepresentation of my own look , you are n't willing to admit us christians went to africa and tried to get an execute-the-gays bill passed in uganda despite the fact it was documented by dozens of sources . 
  google it . 
  you are in literal denial of reality . 
  you ca n't just claim x is false when the rest of the world , even right-wing news sources , agrees x is true . 
   and when you tolerate a belief system that says people like you should be killed , that 's nice and all that you 're tolerant but these people actually want to kill you and will try to kill you !, 
  you do realize the bible literally says gays should be stoned right ? 
  and christians openly try to get shit passed in various countries , including a `` shoot the gays '' petition in the us ? 
  i added links from right wing sources but automod killed it . 
  just look up the sodomite supression act , the kill the gays bill , etc. 
  http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/12/04/pastor-calls-for-killing-gays-to-end-aids/19929973/ a far less interesting example without polls but hey :  he goes on to say killing gays is the way to an aids-free world by christmas . 
  keep pretending these people do n't exist . 
  islamic terrorism is less dangerous than cars , medical errors , and general violent crime . 
  the fact everyone seems to ignore these topics in favor of bitching about muslims makes me think people are n't too bright . 
  -- ** harm to civilians ? 
  ** false . 
  --  25 % of muslims do not reject violence against civilians http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf http://www.people-press.org/2015/05/28/public-continues-to-back-u-s-drone-attacks/  the national survey by the pew research center , conducted may 12-18 among 2,002 adults , finds that 58 % approve of the u.s. conducting missile strikes from drones to target extremists in such countries as pakistan , yemen and somalia . 
  58 % of americans approve killing civilians . 
  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/15/90-of-people-killed-by-us-drone-strikes-in-afghani/  ryan devereaux , a journalist with the website , reported that `` during one five-month period of the operation , according to the documents , nearly 90 percent of the people killed in airstrikes were not the intended targets . '' nevertheless , the u.s. government considers many of these casualties to be enemy combatants , according to the the source , despite the strikes more often than not ending in the deaths of women , children and other civilians who become collateral damage of targeted attacks and are subsequently written off as adversaries killed during war , regardless of status . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/29/us-airstrikes-isis-death-toll  the violations documentation centre , which keeps a detailed public database of civilian deaths in the conflict , says 513 syrian civilians have been killed by international coalition attacks since their aircraft joined the conflict . 
   `` their investigations are not transparent and the ` reasons ' for dismissing evidence seem weak , '' he said . 
  `` they dismiss evidence pointing to civilian casualties if it has n't been captured from the sky by their own operatives , so even if there are photographs of scores and scores of dead bodies , with names , it 's still discounted . '' --  and now let 's look at the rate of violence among muslim communities in the west , which are disproportionately higher than any other group . 
  -- http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/15/no-islam-isn-t-inherently-violent-and-the-math-proves-it.html  what about violent crime ? 
  here muslims are way behind the rest of us -- and in a good way . 
  homicide rates in muslim-majority countries average about two murders per annum per 100,000 people . 
  in non-muslim countries , the average rate is about 8 per 100,000 . 
  murder rates fluctuate from year to year , but they are consistently low in muslim societies . 
  the homicide rate in indonesia , the world 's largest muslim country , is 1 per 100,000 -- one-fifth the rate of the world 's largest christian country , the united states . 
  christian countries live with murder rates that are unknown in the muslim world . 
  brazilians and mexicans are used to murder rates in the 15-25 range ; the rate in venezuela tops 50 . 
  turks , egyptians , iranians , and malaysians live with rates in the 2-4 range . 
  in a good year , christian south africa lives with a murder rate of around 30 . 
  in a bad year , the rate in muslim senegal is one-tenth of that . 
  anyone who is skeptical of these numbers is invited to walk through minaret-dotted dakar and steeple-studded johannesburg at night and compare their experiences in the two cities . 
  for that matter , have a stroll after dark in the low-income areas of istanbul or ankara . 
  then do so in philadelphia or oakland . 
  1 ) quite a few christian countries have higher murder rates than indonesia . 
  2 ) http://www.euro-islam.info/country-profiles/sweden/ 3 ) you said any group , any country . 
  the words `` rape '' and `` crime '' do n't even exist on that page . 
  http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2057744,00.html  but in the townships on the city 's outskirts , another reality reigns . 
  the rate of violence against women in south africa is among the highest in the world . 
  human-rights organizations estimate that over 40 % of south african women will be raped in their lifetime and say that only 1 in 9 rapes are reported -- which is to say that the average south african woman is more likely to be raped than complete secondary school . 
  a survey by south africa 's medical research council in june 2009 found that 1 in 4 south african men admitted to having `` had sex with a woman when she did n't consent , '' and 46 % of those said they had done so more than once . 
  http://www.mediaclubsouthafrica.com/landstatic/82-fast-facts#religion  according to the 2001 census the overwhelming majority of south africans , or 79.8 % , are christian . 
   islam is the religion of 1.5 % of south africans in practical terms , that is a far larger problem then your scare stats from blogs . 
  so please , just stop responding . 
  this is a joke and your `` arguments '' show you never bothered to look at the polls of other groups . 
  i 'd respond further but i 've already had to write two posts do to the char limit to even begin to rebut you , i 've wasted enough time on you . 
   though every group is susceptible to violence , the math proves that muslim communities have a disproportionate rate of crime , hateful beliefs , and support of violence against women and other groups . 
  more than any other group in any other country . 
  and that reality ca n't be ignored . 
  it 's no xenophobic to say , it 's not racist to point out . 
  islam has a problem that desperately needs to be addressed . 
  really now ? 
  any group in any other country ? 
  --  you have pointed out exceptions while completely ignoring the fact that muslim communities have a substantially higher rate of homophobia , sexism , sexual assault , violence , and the encouragement of violent behavior than any other group . 
  it 's an inconvenient truth you may choose to ignore , but the truth it still is . 
  well lets go through a few of your examples shall we ... --  28 % of british muslims want britain to be an islamic state  51 % of american muslims want sharia law , and 39 % believe muslims should be exempt from us laws ( https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2015/06/23/nationwide-poll-of-us-muslims-shows-thousands-support-shariah-jihad/ you think that is more than any other group ? 
  haha < 3 that is adorable . 
  -- http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/ppp_release_national_22415.pdf  support establishing christianity as the national religion ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 57 % http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/10/sarah-palin-american-law_n_569922.html  sarah palin : american law should be ` based on the god of the bible and the ten commandments ' so when you say `` any group '' , y' know your wrong now . 
  just fyi . 
  btw , the only way that is possible is for them to be exempt from us laws since our constitution forbids a national religion . 
  http://fusion.net/story/37698/do-americans-have-the-right-to-criticize-religion/  fusion surveyed 1,502 americans and asked a single question : do americans have the right to blaspheme religion ? 
  we got 1,105 responses , and the results were not very impressive : only 37 % said yes really now :  58 % of american muslims say criticism of islam or muhammad not protected under free speech so ... yeah but do n't worry !, 
  there is more !, 
   58 % of american muslims say criticism of islam or muhammad not protected under free speech i 'm tired of picking on religious groups for the moment so we 'll go with your home country of italy !, 
  surely italy is more progressive with free speech than muslims . 
  right ? 
  right ? 
  http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/20/40-of-millennials-ok-with-limiting-speech-offensive-to-minorities/  we asked whether people believe that citizens should be able to make public statements that are offensive to minority groups , or whether the government should be able to prevent people from saying these things . 
  ...  as do 62 % of italians and half of poles . 
  62 % of you want to censor things that offend people . 
  yay . 
  so progressive . 
  much freedom to criticize . 
  ** nope . 
  evangelicals have encouraged their version of sharia law in africa and tried ( but thankfully failed ) in the us . 
  they are also less progressive than muslims on gay rights . 
  -- evangelical christians have stronger opposition and actively get laws passed in other countries to do so . 
  simply because you casually ignore the entire continent of africa and asia does n't magically make them disappear ... nor does it change the fact christians from the west are the ones responsible . 
  so ... christians do n't support equal rights and push for the imprisonment of gay people just like muslims do under sharia law . 
  simply because they do not call it `` sharia law '' and name it `` religious freedom '' does n't change that fact . 
  http://reason.com/blog/2016/06/13/in-america-muslims-are-more-likely-to-su  in america , muslims are more likely to support gay marriage than evangelical christians  do n't succumb to the fear that u.s. followers of islam are time bombs waiting to explode . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uganda_anti-homosexuality_act,_2014 the original version had the death penalty btw and was broadly supported by christian groups . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/how-uganda-was-seduced-by-anti-gay-conservative-evangelicals-9193593.html  last month , the ugandan president yoweri museveni finally signed his country 's controversial anti-gay bill into law , outlawing homosexuality and threatening offenders with up to 14 years in prison . 
  https://www.thenation.com/article/its-not-just-uganda-behind-christian-rights-onslaught-africa/  but such groups are n't just active in uganda . 
  they have promoted antigay legislation in kenya , nigeria and zimbabwe , just to name a few other places . 
  the support ranges from popular agitation and sideline cheerleading to outright intervention . 
   the religious right , however , does n't see nigerian laws regarding homosexuality as a gross violation of human rights but rather as protection of `` traditional marriage . '' in 2011 , on the heels of the nigerian senate passing an earlier version of the antigay law , president obama announced that the united states would officially promote lgbtq rights abroad as part of its development framework . 
  in response , the catholic family and human rights institute denounced the administration 's directive for putting `` u.s. 
  foreign policy on a collision course with religious freedom . '' btw , in case you think i 'm joking that this is n't what they mean and they truly think its freedom related : http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/18/the-conservative-crusade-for-christian-sharia-law.html  just last week we saw another example of creeping christian sharia law with a bill passed by kansas ' house of representatives that would allow people and businesses to deny services to same sex couples if it violated their `` religious beliefs . '' this proposed law would in essence legally sanction discrimination against gay americans because same sex marriage is not approved by the bible . 
  similar bills are pending in other state 's including mississippi , idaho , and arizona .
