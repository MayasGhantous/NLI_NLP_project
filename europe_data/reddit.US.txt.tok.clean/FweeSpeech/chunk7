   we saw that in 2012 when republican presidential candidate rick santorum declared his belief that the laws in our country must `` comport '' with god 's law . 
  santorum also argued in opposition to marriage equality , that our nation 's values `` are based on biblical truth ... and , those truths do n't change just because people 's attitudes may change . '' they can pass laws in the us with this shit in them . 
  so bullshit . 
   i think our police similarly to the us are more likely to arrest ethnic minorities disproportionately to their size however this doesnt start a massive outcry because someone is n't been beaten or killed by the police in the uk every other week . 
  yep , which is why blm is n't needed there . 
   what is blm doing in london ?? 
  being silly . 
  the us has a real problem with unarmed black people being shot by the police . 
  the uk , on the other hand , does it less often than the most progressive us states . 
   there are a lot , no doubt , yet we do n't have christian isis , do we ? 
  we do actually . 
  :| they are just less effective because the us did n't come in and basically destroy the local government . 
  http://www.salon.com/2015/04/07/6_modern_day_christian_terrorist_groups_our_media_conveniently_ignores_partner/  the mainstream media have had much to say about the islamist brutality of boko haram , but one terrorist group they have n't paid nearly as much attention to is the lord 's resistance army -- which was founded by joseph kony ( a radical christianist ) in uganda in 1987 and has called for the establishment of a severe christian fundamentalist government in that countr  active in the state of tripura in northeastern india since 1989 , nlft is a paramilitary christianist movement that hopes to secede from india and establish a christian fundamentalist government in tripura . 
  nlft has zero tolerance for any religion other than christianity , and the group has repeatedly shown a willingness to kill , kidnap or torture hindus who refuse to be converted to its extreme brand of protestant fundamentalism . 
  --  not that the believers should go on and kill them all now . 
  actually , when it comes to gay people or muslims or non-white people i can find out a christian `` preacher '' that preaches that . 
  the nlft or the national socialist council of nagaland for instance . 
  so ... yeah . 
  i think the problem here is alot of europeans have a european centric view and simply do n't know what goes on in other countries . 
  i 'm literally having this exact same conversation with an italian who insisted jews do n't go on stabbing sprees . 
  then i linked him some of the same links , including one to a jew who went on a stabbing spree . 
  fair enough . 
  i guess i just do n't mind women getting together with other women . 
   you have pointed out exceptions while completely ignoring the fact that muslim communities have a substantially higher rate of homophobia , sexism , sexual assault , violence , and the encouragement of violent behavior than any other group . 
  it 's an inconvenient truth you may choose to ignore , but the truth it still is . 
  you have absolutely no proof of your claims yet you keep insisting its true xd its quite amazing . 
   i 'm not far right , or even close . 
  i 'm a liberal , and because i 'm a liberal i refuse to tolerate any ideology that goes against what liberals have fought to achieve since the age of the enlightenment . 
  equality for all . 
  sure buddy . 
  that is why you are against women organizing and doing their own thing without interference from men . 
   and unlike you i 'm not scared to call out muslim leadership for totally failing to reign in their worshipers like all other religions have . 
  umm . 
  i just showed you catholics have n't . 
  they have bishops blaming children for being abused in the past 12 months . 
   we do n't have christians blowing up bus stations , we do n't have jews going on stabbing sprees , we do n't have mormons storming a concert hall and mutilating and then killing innocent people . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/31/world/middleeast/man-attacks-gay-pride-marchers-in-jerusalem-for-second-time-police-say.html?_r=0  jerusalem -- an ultra-orthodox jewish man who had recently been released from prison after serving 10 years for stabbing participants in the annual gay pride parade here in 2005 struck again thursday , stabbing six marchers in this year 's parade , according to the police . 
  the fact you are n't even aware of the fact ultra-orthodox jews * do * go on stabbing sprees and used it as an example should be enough for you to realize which of is mistaken . 
  but if you like i can go on all day : http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/11/violence-abortion-clinics-planned-parenthood-colorado-springs-shooting https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/28/scott-roeder-abortion-doctor-killer http://www.salon.com/2015/04/07/6_modern_day_christian_terrorist_groups_our_media_conveniently_ignores_partner/  by pretending that this insanity is n't happening not only endangers us but also endangers our peaceful friends within the same muslim communities you wish to protect . 
  i think you are confused about whom is pretending . 
  look , if you let women have women-only clubs it tends to be a * good thing * for them . 
  women getting organized and talking to each other without men around is how they got things like the right to vote . 
  opposing that while arguing they are oppressed is fundamentally insane . 
  i 'm not going to engage with you further . 
  i suggest you stop listening solely to domestic , right-wing news outlets and get a broader prospective on how the world works . 
  yeah but that is really an argument that violent muslims should be put in prison ... at which point you can just remove the word `` muslim '' and replace it with `` people '' and it would be equally true . 
  so ... the problem here is people in glass houses keep throwing stones . 
  a small minority of muslims are dangerous people who need to be locked up or taken out and shot . 
  that is true of literally every fucking population of people on the planet . 
   but that analogy fails because nudist lesbians wo n't have the shit beat out of them by their partners , or told that they ca n't enter heaven , if they decide to dress how they want . 
  because no catholic man has ever done that . 
  do you really want me to start making lists of men who did that that were christian ? 
  or the ones that said women who were `` asking for it '' because they dressed a bit too revealing ? 
  are you really this ignorant of history ? 
  http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/victims_partly_to_blame_in_priest_sex-abuse_cases_syracuse_bishop_testified.html  syracuse , n.y. -- the victims of child-molesting priests are partly to blame for their own abuse , the bishop of syracuse said in a sworn deposition that revealed his views on the church 's sex abuse scandal . 
  that does n't even get into the child molestation . 
  there really is no moral high ground you can even get close to . 
   that analogy completely ignores the political and religious backdrop though . 
  unless you start applying that to events that only include nuns or something , the political/religious backdrop is a lie tbh . 
   but a wider question to ask in this case of the burkni-only day is ` why would this particular event be necessary ? ' . 
  i think you need to ask yourself if this would be an issue if a group of lesbian nudists booked the waterpark for a day . 
  would anyone argue about the dress code and exclusion of men then ? 
  i suspect not . 
  good job america . 
  if only you morons had not fucking invaded iraq . 
   could be wrong but twitter said the deceased victim was actually american . 
  vikings killed those too . 
   reading these , the question then arises : what 's the purpose of all these ? 
  why would the fbi create terrorists ? 
  so they can shut down all the mosques and prosecuted all muslims in the usa ? 
  sounds a bit far-fetched to be honest . 
  when your job is to make donuts , you make donuts . 
  when your job is to arrest terrorists , you end up with the easiest way to arrest the number of terrorists required . 
  its a very common phenomena that people optimize for the statistic/metric they are being judged on to the detriment of others . 
   but even so , there are no evidence as of now that this is happening in france and germany . 
  authorities here operate based on whether the attacker 's mosque is teaching jihad or not . 
  do you really want me to start linking you to youtube videos and such in the us of evangelicals preaching hate and death ? 
  fox puts collar on people with r next to their names then jerks the chain whenever they step out of line . 
  my condolences :(, 
   wasnt saddam considered an ally , especially during the iran iraq war ? 
  i remember seeing videos and pictures of rumsfeld and cheney with saddam . 
  saddam was a tool to hit back at iran after their revolution . 
  it is like saying stalin was the us 's ally in ww2 . 
  its sorta-technically true on some level but its not an alliance in the sense of nato or any long standing relationship . 
  its an alliance of convenience for a single conflict to eliminate a specific enemy . 
   the russians i talked are telling a different story , how you guys toppled their man in ukraine for example . 
  yes , its part of the propaganda they created to justify their military actions against ukraine . 
  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ukrainian-parliament-after-ousting-president-tries-to-consolidate-power-frees-prisoners/2014/02/23/9246255c-9ca6-11e3-9080-5d1d87a6d793_story.html  oleksandr yefremov , a leader of yanukovych 's party of regions , said he `` strongly condemns the criminal orders that led to human victims , an empty state treasury , huge debts and the shame before the eyes of the ukrainian people and the entire world . '' that is the leader of his own f 'n party . 
  its the equivalent of dmitry medvedev calling putin a criminal . 
  if you think the us can make that happen , well , i 'm amazed by our omnipotence . 
   that would mean starting ww3 , i do not think ukraine is worth the risk for the us . 
  i do not know about that , especially given the increase of us and nato troops in the baltics and poland . 
  you think vietnam was ? 
  o.o we 've had conventional shooting wars with russian allies during the cold war . 
   actually you have troops in syria and the us airforce is very active in the northern part of the country . 
  we 've sent special forces and airstrikes to strike against isis and other islamist groups . 
  that is n't an invasion . 
  here let me you show you an invasion of a me country by us forces : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_iraq  160,000 troops were sent by the coalition into iraq , during the initial invasion phase , which lasted from 19 march to 9 april 2003 . 
  about 130,000 were sent from the usa alone , with about 28,000 british soldiers , australia ( 2,000 ) , and poland ( 194 ) . 
  36 other countries were involved in its aftermath .
