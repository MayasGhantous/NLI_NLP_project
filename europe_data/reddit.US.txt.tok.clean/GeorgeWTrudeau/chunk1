about 7/7 . 
  lol, 
  lol your post history is hilarious . 
  ** to be fair , given the confusing 2-part way the questions were structured , it could basically be read as a tie , but that said , their legislature did put a non-binding resolution afterwards calling for statehoood & iirc , the puerto rican frontrunner for governor is also committed to statehood , so you probably got a point all things considered !, 
  ** ** and to be fair , if trump did n't assfuck things this year with hispanics , the republicans had a real chance of flipping them red like they flipped cubans , but fat fucking chance now !, 
  ** to be fair puerto ricans actually prefer the status quo , with statehood coming in 2nd & independence a very , very distant 3rd !, 
  because all of us have guns . 
  lol we 're going to find a way to bring you down with us dipshit , whether through collapsing the global economy or collapsing european security . 
  our revolutions were born together & i 'll be fucking damned if we do n't go down together . 
  lol you 're so fucked finland . 
  i never said the united states should n't back & support the eu in this shit , only that it should n't have to * do it for you * & have * you be totallg reliant upon us * for it . 
  we did n't need you to do iraq & afghanistan for us , but we did want solidarity & benefit from the * extra * help in regards to it , which is not something i 'm saying we should deny the eu in any way what-so-ever . 
  also , since we 're going that far back , you can also throw in the balkans , with europe completely dropping the ball there for damn near a decade , right in their own neighborhood , with genocide & open-warfare right across the border , until the united states got seriously involved . 
  and really ? 
  afghanistan did n't make any sense to you ? 
  what-so-ever ? 
  in any way possible ? 
  no fucking wonder why france was originally handicapped in getting european help for mali or eastern europe is worried about little green men chopping up their territory without a proper response from western europe . 
  lol also , france & germany did n't back us in iraq , so when two of the largest & most powerful countries in the eu oppose it , can you really claim europe in general followed us into it ? 
  and * even despite that * , we 've still stood by you & backed you on all that shit i pointed out above afterwards . 
  i agree !, 
  and so does obama !, 
  which is why he told europe you need to * `` increase military spending & police your own backyard '' * , why he * `` led from behind in libya '' * in a attempt to prod europe into doing more & was trying his best to force other european countries to fully commit to seriously helping france in mali before , once again , more responsibility fell on america 's shoulders . 
  i mean , for fuck 's sake , russia invaded a country directly on the eu 's border ... because * it wanted closer relations with the eu * ... annexed a chunk of it , fueled a guerilla war in the other half of it , shot down a plane of eu citizens over it & even began intimidating ee eu members around it ... ** so why in the fuck did america need to lead the charge there ** until the eu could regroup from the back & forth bickering ? 
  i mean ... how in the hell can people in this thread call * us * unwilling & weak ... when * we 're the ones * getting * our interests sidetracked * over eu issues that the eu should be taking a leading role in ? 
  and when * we 're the ones * begging them to increase military spending & double-down on a independent military capability regionally ? 
  i mean ... it 's just kinda fucked up that we 're doing all this shit for you guys , saying all this shit to you guys , have been repeating it for more than a decade , and you do n't pay any attention what-so-ever to it until a loudmouthed orange dumbass comes along . 
  lol, 
  if you did n't even want to back the united states against the fucking taliban & al-qaeda after the worst terrorist attack in american history , how the fuck are you going to be relied upon to help eastern europe against little green men who chop up territory piece-by-piece ? 
  lol, 
  are you serious dude ? 
  we 've been pushing you guys towards greater military integration with each other & independent military capabilities from us since the cold war , basically begging you through several presidents to meet the 2 % gdp spending on your militaries & take the lead in policing * `` your own backyard '' * , but the only time you actually pay attention is when you want to insult us & pretend we 're weak ? 
  lol * and now you say this because of fucking trump ?!? 
  * where were the upvotes a couple * years ago * when obama told ya 'll , point-blank , basically * `` you need to increase military spending & take care of your own backyard with better regional cooperation '' * ? 
  oh yeah , i forgot , they went to him being mocked & derided as a warmongering american imperialist for it . 
  and according to polls , the [ ** majority of german , french & italian citizens would n't want to protect a european nato member who came under attack while the majority of americans would ** ] ( http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/?fa=60389 ) , and even ignoring that , we were the principle force in herding europe to properly confront russia on ukraine , even as the move was getting heavy flak & divided reaction from several influential countries in the eu , we were the principle ally to europe in libya despite not wanting to even do it and france 's most valuable partner in mali despite other european countries not wanting get involved or hesitating for a year & two before they did , but * we 're * the unreliable one ? 
  ** edit : ** and you know what aggravates me the most ? 
  i fucking *** hate *** trump with all my soul , but none of you seemed to give a shit about what people like obama & clinton were trying to tell you , over & over again , in the plainest words , so ya 'll just kept ignoring it & brushing them off , until it eventually bubbled up & exploded into * our * political mainstream as a platform plank for trump out of general american frustration with it all , and now we 're facing the worst scenario for * all * our countries in regards to defense policy . 
  no i 'm saying i would n't be surprised if one of the ways they managed to avoid detection was because of assistance through industrial espionage . 
  did n't a massive german corporation with a large government ownership stake , as well as having heavy state involvement & influence in general , just manage to defraud hundreds of thousands of americans & fool american regulators with a highly sophisticated & complex conspiracy ? 
  heh ... wonder if they got any help ... 
  has n't france been caught committing industrial espionage against the united states red-handed like multiple times ? 
  tbf , the country did vote for brexit . 
  so is your unemployment . 
  lol, 
  yet for more than a century we stood by & let europe drag us into two world wars , and then afterwards still stood by you & were ready to fight a third one to protect you . 
  we were the main outside force pushing for a more integrated europe even as many pushed hard against it & we 're the one who provided the security umbrella with our commitment to nato for it to happen . 
  we 're one who dumped billions in foreign aid to establish a economic foundation for it to happen through things like the marshall plan & forgave billions in loans as we did with germany to help prevent it from being handicapped . 
  we championed , helped negotiate & guaranteed germany 's reunification at the end of the cold war when many , in europe itself , feared it & demanded the country stay divided . 
  we 've continued to bolster eastern europe with foreign aid in this context as well ever since the fall of the wall . 
  when the euro was introduced , we took actions in the market to help stabilize it after it 's rocky start , and when the great recession hit , we used a backdoor in our own economic stimulus to provide european banks much needed liquidity to help buffer them when they were at their lowest & in the most need . 
  hell , to this very day we 've stood in solidarity with the european union & european interests . 
  we basically forced & pulled the eu , while some members kicked & screamed , into sanctioning russia after they invaded a country right on the eu 's border , who 's main crime was daring to push for closer relations * with * the eu . 
  we 're one of the most committed , with the most weight behind our words , to the defense of eastern european countries continuously threatened & harassed by russia , even as others in other parts of europe waiver in eu solidarity & commitment to it 's collective defense . 
  but now you take fucking afghanistan , which was in response to the worst terrorist attack in my country 's entire history , as a excuse to abandon us ? 
  even though you got to avoid things like vietnam completely & iraq for the most part , not to mention * drag us * into another war with libya while also being the ones who pushed hardest for us to bomb assad in syria * ( french here ) * ? 
  hell , and let 's not forget the balkans either where europe dropped the ball for damn near a decade until enough international pressure built up to the point of forcing us to seriously get involved . 
  and you want to distance ties with us because of what exactly in reference to the pacific ? 
  us standing up against china , who is violating international law , as indicated by a hague ruling , and attempting to claim the world 's most trafficked shipping lane * ( the south china sea ) * as it 's own personal lake as opposed to being a international waterway open to all * ( a precedent which is critical to us all ) * ? 
  and also entailing the aggressive annexation of territory belonging to several of it 's neighbors ? 
  you know , i fucking hate trump , want a federal european union , opposed brexit & pray against a grexit . 
  but fuckers like you make me hope that trump wins with his disdain for nato , isolationist streak & protectionist rhetoric , that the eu stays paralyzed in it 's bullshit red-tape ridden confederal state , that britain ends up the better for leaving & greece follows soon . 
  ** if you ca n't see or help maintain the mutual benefits of this partnership at it 's best you deserve to feel every pain of it 's break-down at it 's worst . 
    oh , but do n't worry , only big evil american corporations use those , and they totally ar n't just being scapegoated while all those other european corporations are basically ignored because europe is n't innovative enough due to skimping on r&d spending , or willing enough to risk the needed venture capital to take advantage of that r&d , to compete with them . 
   do n't really know whether i agree with this or not , so i wont comment . 
  point being that people assume america dominates in tech because of monopolies * ( even though there 's a bunch of competition in the american market itself & different between american corporations internationally ) * & tax evasion , when really we just invest more & risk more * ( not to mention european tech companies be taking advantage of those same tax havens ) * : *** research & development spending *** * ** united states ** - 2.74 % of gdp * ( $ 473.4 billion ) * * ** european union ** - 1.94 % of gdp * ( $ 334.3 billion ) * *** venture capital investment *** * ** united states ** - .3 % of gdp * ( $ 52.1 billion ) * * ** european union ** - .06 % of gdp * ( $ 10.6 billion ) * so , instead of european governments increasing spending on r&d , or european investors risking more money in venture investment to take advantage of that r&d , so as to allow & enable european tech companies to actually be able to compete & succeed fairly , they 're instead lobbying & using the european union to go after & handicap american tech corporations unfairly , while also scapegoating them for every tax problem they have , so they can get get upperhand & avoid the spotlight from being on them . 
  but sweden does n't extradite for politically-motivated & based charges so why is he running from the swedish police over a rape charge or expecting the warrant to be temporarily waived ? 
  see , you 're doing it now . 
  lol ami go home !, 
  you do n't until you do & when you do you say you do n't . 
  [ ** you say that like it 's a choice ** ] ( https://youtu.be/asn1g-6h1oq ), 
  bitches do n't care how much time you got , only how much money you got to spend homie . 
  that 's why we out here big pimpin ' the world & shit . 
  work hard , play hard, 
  one of these days i 'm gon na buy a yacht & sail it up the rhine fucker,

  lmao this guy . 
  you & alex jones buddy , you & alex jones . 
  austerity & a single market currency union that has free movement without a fiscal union . 
  turns out , forcing spending cuts & demanding surpluses from everybody , without any fiscal injections from the wealthy north & west to the poorer south & east , while also making it easier for poorer people to move to wealthier regions , and for wealthier foreign corporations to compete with poorer domestic corporations , will turn out exactly how you think it would . 
  not to mention tax havens that corporations from poorer countries can get away with using , depriving their cash-strapped respective governments of more much-needed revenue , and which are now easier to use thanks to the eurozone . 
  oh , but do n't worry , only big evil american corporations use those , and they totally ar n't just being scapegoated while all those other european corporations are basically ignored because europe is n't innovative enough due to skimping on r&d spending , or willing enough to risk the needed venture capital to take advantage of that r&d , to compete with them . 
   welcome to the fucking club though ... it 's less / r/europe for us & more the entire world in real life ... that and we do n't really care either ... we just kinda welcome ourselves & tell the rest to just deal ... . than throw money & bullets at people so most talk shit more in hushed voices behind our back or on the internet than to our face ... 
  jesus christ , clinton is n't trying to start a war with russia . 
  i mean , just because she 's not putin 's isolationist buttbuddy like trump does n't mean she 'll start wwiii . 
  that said , fuck it , maybe trump should be elected , withdraw from nato , pursue a foreign policy of isolationism & go overdrive of protectionism . 
  let finland have fun with another half-century of finlandization without behind-the-scenes american hard power & soft power helping prevent it by proxy through the u.s. 's security ties with the eu & scandinavian/baltic nato members right next to it , not to mention finland 's own recent military & other ties that it forged on the low with us while russia was still pre-occupied with trying to figure out wtf just happened after the soviet union 's collapse . 
  it 's not unsolicited if it 's in response to a comment about clinton genius . 
  lol and : * ** there was no revelation of the dnc encouraging voter fraud ; you 're lying out your teeth just like the candidate you support ** * ** the main criticism here of obama is that he was to soft on foreign policy & one of the main criticisms of clinton from trump is that she was too soft on isis ( * while he wants to abandon pretty much all our military alliances & withdraw from most our military bases if not paid a arbitrary protection fee * ) ** * ** greater free movement in north america is n't something i oppose dude & you 're in a sub where the eurozone is pretty fucking popular lol ** * ** there really was n't much in the paid speeches leaks & other than that you 're just describing the realities of politics , pretty or not ** also , let 's look at trump 's policies : * [ ** donald trump promises the largest tax cuts since reagan ** ] ( http://fortune.com/2016/08/06/donald-trump-tax-cut/ ) * [ ** trump calls for military spending increase ; $ 500 billion reinvestment over 10 years ** ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/06/politics/donald-trump-defense-spending-sequester/index.html ) * [ ** trump says he 'd double clinton 's $ 275 billion infrastructure plan ** ] ( http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/290121-trump-on-paying-for-infrastructure-projects-well-get-a-fund ) * [ ** trump promises reform , but no cuts to social security & medicaire ; experts say would add $ 11.3 trillion to the federal debt by 2026 ** ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-hillary-clinton-and-donald-trump-view-social-security/ ) * [ ** trump says he will eliminate $ 19 trillion in federal debt in 8 years ; force creditors to accept pennies on the dollar for u.s. treasury bonds ** ] ( http://www.newsmax.com/finance/streettalk/donald-trump-national-debt-economy-creditors/2016/05/07/id/727686/ ) oh , and you can probably add that continental-wide & heavily-guarded wall he wants on there too , if he could even manage to get it built , because let 's be real , there 's no way in god damn hell mexico is contributing a damn dime too helping build it . 
  lol ** he 's popular because he 's promising to outspend democrats , outcut republicans & not take any responsibility for the debt that acculamates afterwards . 
  ** trump is a greedy fuck with a silver spoon who wants to treat the nation like one of his shit corporations , but the only difference is that it 's not some shitty casino on a atlantic city boardwalk that would be closing down due to bankruptcy , it 'd be * us * . 
  and just ignoring all the actual policy shit , the man is a proto-fascist authoritarian propped up by a angry populist mob who worships his cult of personality . 
  he wants to out millions of american citizens on a register & under closer surveillance because of their religion & says a federal judge ca n't preside over his case because of the judge 's race . 
  he 's said he might not accept the election results , that his opponent is illegitimate , that he would lock up her & her lawyers if elected and that anybody who critisizes him is basically guilty of libel . 
  even if you support his policies , his undemocratic , unamerican & just general rhetoric which threatens our very national foundation itself should be enough for anybody to oppose him on principle alone . 
  or , in the words of the ** the harvard republican club ** after they refused to endorse the republican candidate for the first time in 126-years :  donald trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as republicans , but as americans . 
   if enacted , donald trump 's platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad . 
   perhaps most importantly , however , donald trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the united states through an increasingly perilous world . 
   ** donald trump is a threat to the survival of the republic . 
  his authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy .
