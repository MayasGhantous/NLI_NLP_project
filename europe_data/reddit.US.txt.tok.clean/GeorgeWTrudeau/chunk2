  he hopes to divide us by race , by class , and by religion , instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the white house . 
  he is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor , friend against friend , american against american . 
  we will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children . 
  **  we call on our party 's elected leaders to renounce their support of donald trump , and urge our fellow college republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man . 
  the only way the superdelegates would 've mattered was if they all flipped for sanders to override clinton 's popular vote win . 
  also , primaries are run , certified & regulated by state governments , state courts & local bodies , with all those checks & balances that come with them . 
  you know , when a unknown group firebombed that empty gop office , clinton was quick to disavow it , criticize it & say those actions had no place in america & that the perpetrators should immediately be brought to justice to answer for the crime . 
  trump immediately associated it with clinton & basically blamed her specifically for it . 
  when three avowed trump supporters planned & gathered materials for multiple bombings to kill hundreds of somali immigrants , women & children included , in a high-profile case that dominated headlines , clinton expressed the same sentiment as above , and did n't dare try to associate it with or blame trump . 
  trump said nothing about it & never commented on it . 
  also , you do n't see [ ** this disgusting shit ** ] ( http://latest.com/2016/10/trump-rally-goer-openly-talks-coup-bloodshed-and-assassinating-hillary/ ) gaining popular traction at hillary rallies like at trump rallies , shit comparable to hillary 's head being on a sign with cross-hairs , or clinton saying shit like trump does , like how * `` second amendment '' * people should handle clinton , how * `` she would n't last without a security detail '' * , or giving the stage to people who say she should be shot for treasons . 
  trump 's campaign has been fucking disgusting & you should feel disgusting if you support it . 
  that 's fair . 
  but , like i said , it does paint the eu leadership in a rather shittier light though , does n't it ? 
  since he 's actually been the more aggressive & committed one in confronting russia when compared to them , even despite all the above . 
  and , iirc , after russia 's actions in ukraine , the missile shield has been restarted with poland & romania . 
  i actually think clinton would be really beneficial to america & her allies national interests in a international context . 
  but given how much people in europe love shitting all over america , maybe it 's * you guys * who deserve trump , someone who basically wants to abandon every foreign economic & military agreement , or shit , by the sound of some of his rhetoric , globalist institution as well , we 've been apart of since wwii in favor of radical protectionism & isolationism . 
  you want ami to go home & fuck off from the rest of the world for good , than i do n't know why you 're not out here blushing over the people 's champion , mr. trump over here , the man who went up against the party establishment by himself , as a outsider , and won the nomination by pure votes & willpower alone . 
  she 'd be in a more contested fight , but there really is n't much more to her than being a establishment politician who has been under the opposition 's microscope for more than three decades . 
  but that 's what happens . 
  in politics , you need to compromise with people you do n't like to move the ball in the right direction & sacrifice things you want for things you need to get shit done . 
  that 's the real world dude , but for people who like to deny it , such as radical anti-establishment populists , every compromise is a liaison with the devil to never be forgotten , every sacrifice is a betrayal to never be left alone , no matter the context of the situation or reality on the ground . 
  shit , and the opposition , especially when it 's the republicans , from gingrich to the tea party , they 'll tear you apart for anything & everything , as well as egging on the above . 
  half the fucking anti-hillary posts on / r/politics during the primaries were from fucking briebart , who 's owner is now running trump 's campaign . 
  hell , republicans spent more money trying to keep hillary out of the senate than they did putting w. in the white house . 
  citizens united got started because of anti-hillary propaganda . 
  you know , there 's a reason sanders voted the same way as her in the senate 93 % of the time , received donations from her in the past & is now heavily campaigning for her . 
  and what 's stopping republicans from always electing trump ? 
  nothing . 
  lol there were no superdelegates , just republican voters , and they nominated trump by the highest number they ever have had . 
  there should be consequences for stupidity & if continuously losing for nominating trump-like candidates is that price , well , than so be it . 
  lol you can blame the party system all you want , but trump was a party outsider who won on vote share alone . 
  * `` controlled opposition '' * & * `` corrupt party politics '' * should n't even be in the same sentence as the man , since there was nothing controlled or corrupt about trump 's nomination , whether you like it or not . 
  on some real shit , the party system & the establishment kept men like trump out . 
  but trump outsmarted * `` the system '' * & outplayed the establishment . 
  but now all these anti-establishment types who hate * `` the system '' * get exactly what they want , yet all they do is bitch about the people 's champion not being how they envisioned him ? 
  lol nah bruh , they made this bed , and now they can lay in it too . 
  meh , clinton ai n't that bad at all . 
  this whole false equivalence meme bullshit is really fucking annoying in the context of trump , a radical populist who flirts with fascist ideas and whom is propped up by a angry mob which worships his * `` strongman '' * personality cult . 
  he was also the only one in the west who pushed for a larger & more united response , basically forcing the eu into seriously confronting russian aggression on their border , even as many members in the union kicked & screamed while he dragged them to do it . 
  you 're mad at obama for not doing more , but fail to remember he was also doing the most . 
  even in the new world poland ca n't escape german encroachment . 
  lol also was n't expecting french creole for my state . 
  i 'm guessing that 's due to haitian immigrants . 
  to be fair , you * are * represented by a bunch of landholding inbreds who have a history of oppressing black people . 
  a lot of far east asian countries excel in rotary learning , but lack severely when it comes to innovation & out-of-the-box problem solving . 
  it 's causing a huge drag on higher education in china at the moment * ( hence all the plagiarized & forged science papers they 've been caught with as of late ) * , and i 'm actually surprised to see japan in fist plave in context of this . 
  germany & canada ar n't on the list !, 
  the schadenfreude over both 's superiority/inferiority complex in regards to the united states fuels me . 
  to be fair nyc 's gdp is worth like between $ 1.3-1 .5 trillion ... which is bigger than the majority of european countries in general ... 
  putin stronk like chavez stronk like trump stronk so putin get stronk prize . 
  i 'm like 90 % sure they only did this because they were jelly about the columbian president getting a nobel peace prize . 
  lol him managing to do it by getting within a hair of de-fanging venezuela 's main proxy in columbia , farc , was probably * really * annoying to them too on top of it . 
   russia has moved nuclear-capable iskander-m missiles into the kaliningrad enclave bordering poland and lithuania , the russian defence ministry said on saturday , adding it was part of routine drills . 
   `` * these missile units have been deployed more than once ( in the kaliningrad region ) ... and will be deployed as part of military training of the russian armed forces , * '' ministry spokesman igor konashenkov said . 
   a us intelligence official said on friday that russia had started moving the iskander-ms into the enclave on the baltic , in what he said could be a gesture to express displeasure with nato . 
   konashenkov said one of the missiles had been deliberately exposed to a us spy satellite . 
  `` * we did not have to wait for too long -- our american partners confirmed it themselves in their revelatory endeavour , * '' he said . 
   lithuania , which neighbours kaliningrad and is a member of nato , said it would protest against the move . 
  `` * the deployment not only increases tensions in the region , but also possibly violates international treaties which limit deployment of ballistic missiles of range of over 500km , * '' the foreign minister , linas linkevi\u010dius , told a news briefing in vilnius . 
   _______________  some modifications of the iskander can hit targets 700km ( * 450 miles * ) away , putting the german capital of berlin in range of kaliningrad , linkevi\u010dius said . 
   `` * this is a usual russian tactic : escalate tensions , create a discord and then expect concessions elsewhere . 
  i would like to hope that this will not work this time , . 
   venezuelan president nicolas maduro on friday announced the creation of peace prize in honor of late socialist leader hugo chavez , and said he was awarding it to russian president vladimir putin . 
   the announcement comes on the same day that the nobel committee awarded its annual peace prize to juan manuel santos , president of neighboring colombia , for his role in negotiating a peace agreement with marxist farc rebels . 
   '' * i 've decided to create the hugo chavez prize for peace and the sovereignty , * '' maduro said during a televised broadcast to unveil a statue of chavez designed by a russian artist . 
   '' * i think president vladimir putin deserves this hugo chavez award , * '' he said , describing putin as a '' * fighter for peace '' * . 
  compare the saa 's advances with american support to iraq 's with american support , and even to the sdf working with like 1/6th the amount of men * ( if not less ) * what the saa is working with and like basically none of the saa 's armor & artillery and like a tiny fraction of the atgm-type heavy weaponry the saa is working with . 
  also : [ ** u.n. criticism of trump draws russian complaint ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56fp6y/un_criticism_of_trump_draws_russian_complaint/?sort=new ) they 're not even trying to hide it . 
  lol, 
   ** geneva ( * ap * ) ** -- russia lodged a formal complaint last month with the united nations over a top u.n. official 's condemnations of donald trump and some european politicians , an intervention that underscores the unusual links between the republican presidential nominee and the kremlin . 
  yeah , and then after that , even though they brushed it off as a soros/cia op targeting putin , they still criticized them for not releasing everything at once . 
  in the context of assange holding onto the dnc hack info , which he got from russian hackers , for months & months until he could most damage hillary & help trump . 
  and the reason they did n't release it all at once * ( there was a couple weeks wait ) * was because they were brushing out personal information that could cause harm to people . 
  meanwhile , despite sitting on the hacked info for months , assange still managed to release it with absolutely no personal info what-so-ever wiped for individual donors , staffers & politicians . 
  shit , they still had personal phone numbers for congressmen in there . 
  it 's a dnc campaign narrative because russia hacked the dnc & gave the info to assange . 
  lol, 
  you 've given them to yourselves too . 
  you made luxembourg a fucking nation . 
  you literally made a tax-haven a entire country & then elected their prime minister to lead you . 
  lol, 
  wow so weird . 
  not on foreign policy . 
  lol, 
  lol if anything trump would be the one turning america into switzerland with all his talk about military preparedness & fortifying borders ontop of his isolationist tendacies . 
  corbyn is more like a belgian leader before either world war or a kuwaiti leader before the first world war . 
  it 's not unprecedented . 
   * england is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality . 
  in left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every english institution , from horse racing to suet puddings . 
  it is a strange fact , but it is unquestionably true that almost any english intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during ` god save the king ' than of stealing from a poor box . 
  all through the critical years many left-wingers were chipping away at english morale , trying to spread an outlook that was sometimes squashily pacifist , sometimes violently pro-russian , but always anti-british . 
  * - ** george orwell , 1941 **, 
  switzerland turned itself into a mountain fortress & never ignored military preparedness . 
  so many people forget this when they talk about swiss neutrality . 
  lol, 
  bruh ... you live in a country who benefits most from american protection & will never know a serious threat because of it ... have some empathy for the countries in border regions , in what 's a increasingly multipolar world , that do n't have the same type of guarantees as you & have known the soviet boot for almost as long as canada 's been truly independent from empire ... ** edit : ** i 'm on mobile , so dude 's country comes up as canada since i ca n't see flair . 
  * that 's * your dream & you moved to * canada * of all places ? 
  lol,
