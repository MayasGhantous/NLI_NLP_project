  lol shut up canada . 
  go back to pretending you can go challenge russia by claiming the northwest passage & those disputed arctic oil fields without hiding behind us every time they start to make a fuss over it . 
  you know ... you brits really thought you got off easy with us making fun of you for the brexit by pointing out trump ... but than you go & get this dude ... lol, 
  ** if you 're not a socialist by twenty you have no heart , if you 're not a capitalist by forty you have no brain . 
  it 's a surprise . 
  do n't tell . 
  a lot of anti-americans in europe probably dislike it because they see it as a american project after generations of the u.s. helping prop it and it 's predecesser organizations up with economic , political & military support . 
  stuff like [ ** this ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_committee_on_united_europe ) probably does n't help either :  the ** american committee on united europe ( * acue * ) ** , founded in 1948 , was an american organization which sought to counter the communist threat in europe by promoting european political integration . 
   ____________  declassified american government documents have shown that the acue was an important early funder of both the european movement and the european youth campaign . 
   _____________  the u.s. policy was to promote a united states of europe , and to this end the committee was used to discreetly funnel cia funds - by the mid 50 's acue was receiving roughly $ 1,000,000 usd per year - to european pro-federalists supporting such organizations as the council of europe , the european coal and steel community , and the proposed european defence community . 
   the end of an article appearing in the daily telegraph in september 2000 noted that : the state department also played a role . 
  a memo from the european section , dated june 11 , 1965 , advises the vice-president of the european economic community , robert marjolin , to pursue monetary union by stealth . 
  it recommends suppressing debate until the point at which '' * adoption of such proposals would become virtually inescapable * '' . 
  `` greece threatens to leave eurozone '' `` germany threatens to force greece out of eurozone '' `` imf threatens to leave negotiations unless germany agrees to more debt forgiveness & greece committs to more reforms '' `` germany says plz bby do n't go , but also no to all demands for debt cut ; greece says it 's a strong independent black woman who never needed no imf to start with '', 
  kinda weird to be honest . 
  unemployment is collapsing , but growth is slowing , and yet the federal reserve is raising interest rates . 
  just feel like all of those things are a bit contradictory . 
  lol but than again , we have been in a rather better position than europe for awhile , given that we recovered all the ground we lost 6 years ago in 2011 , while europe as a whole only recovered to pre-peak levels early last year . 
  why not both ? 
  to make money instead of spending it . 
  pretty much every state has laws saying they do . 
  and oh , juncker was a mep pre-commission ? 
  lol, 
  when did you vote for juncker again ? 
  lol and the electoral college is still tied to voters . 
  no , but they are permitted to divide into about 5 different states without congressional permission * ( other states need it ) * . 
  ** fun fact : ** ohio is the home state of the most astronauts , mainly because they all wanted to get as far away from ohio as possible . 
  better to burn out than fade away homie . 
  eh , seccession was a last resort . 
  if britain had just given us our fair share of seats in westminister & agreed to a federal arrangement for autonomy , than the british empire would probably still be around right now . 
  oh , and also because we do n't wan na go out like some bitch . 
  we built this shit with a blood price so you 'll have to pay a blood price to tear it down . 
  not really , else we would n't have trump . 
  that said , even though i fucking hate the guy , i actually support the electoral college . 
  feel like it helps balance out the disparity between bigger & smaller population states , and by extension , urban & rural voters , when it comes to the presidency . 
  urban voters & larger population states decide about 80 % of the time which way the presidency goes , so it 's good in my opinion for rural voters & small population states to have that 20 % release valve every now or then , for better or for worse . 
  * on one hand , i feel you , because trump is a damn near-treasonous bitch & brexit damages the trans-atlantic alliance * but on the other hand , juncker is a anti-american bitch who 's wanted to trade our alliance in for stronger ties with russia , and on top of that , scottish independence would cripple our closest ally so you see my dilemma ... i absolutely hate everybody in this situation ... the snp , brussels , the white house , westminister , etc. 
  juncker has had highly-publicized meetings with both sturgeon & salmond to discuss brexit , and the eu parliament stays doing shit like [ ** this ** ] ( https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/10676/european-parliament-recognises-scotland-s-remain-vote-brexit-begins ) while publishing reports like [ ** this ** ] ( http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/scotland-could-remain-europe-until-10099754 ) . 
  fair enough . 
  yep , the guns shoot faster now . 
  so the eu is justified in moving to help or encourage the breaking-apart & crippling of a eu member because it voted to leave ? 
  we are though . 
  and more so than the eu . 
  lol but anyway , we 're not allowed to vote for a lot of things . 
  like making trump the king of america or abolishing the supreme court . 
  weird , right ? 
  sounds more like hotel california to me . 
  ^ ^ ^ fucking ^ ^ ^ ha ^ ^ ^ lol, 
  lol ar n't allowed to vote us into a monarchy either . 
  scotland is not a eu member . 
  they are apart of a eu member . 
  and that eu member voted to leave , which i personally do n't agree with , but there it is . 
  actually it would be . 
  the federal government would * make it * their choice if california had a bunch of seccessionists committing treason & trying to break up the union . 
  not to mention all the private federalist militias that would inevitably pop up if the feds looked like , even for a second , that they * might * tolerate it . 
  so ... so much cash , guns & volunteers would flood into cali ... 
  no they do n't . 
  lol, 
  you mean what if california voted to secede , but central california did n't ? 
  since they 're a single state like the uk is a single nation ? 
  i do n't know . 
  try to carve it up & break it apart like the eu is doing the uk ? 
  lol but no , on a serious note , the federal government is n't retarded enough to tolerate a refrendum like that , and even * if they did * , i 'd be packing up to go west & join a federalist militia to keep them in the union , because there will * definately * be a war in that scenario , fuck who voted to do what , so i do n't really get the question to begin with . 
  oh , and the eu is made up of nations ... unlike us . 
  hence your weird three-speed fifty layer membership . 
  so you really need to do some soul-searching & decide on whether you 're a federation of states forever united or a confederation of nations voluntarily working together before you start trying to get on the same level as america & push us around . 
  nothing apparently . 
  which means america is doing even less to the eu . 
  lol, 
  they are working on it . 
  hence why the leader of yes california is currently living in russia & setting up a * `` embassy '' * there . 
  lol shit , they 've been getting a ridiculos amount of coverage from rt too over the past year , even when it 's only like 3 people * `` protesting '' * in a mall . 
  but once again , it 's massively unpopular ... and california , like the rest of america , is rather insular & ignorant of european affairs , so do n't expect most to know who the hell juncker is or care much for the eu overall . 
  how is what the united states doing much different from what the eu is doing with scotland ? 
  it 's a unpopular fringe movement led by a dude currently living in russia . 
  and even if it was n't , the entire state would balkanize overnight . 
  for instance , more conservative central california would secede to remain with the united states & avoid being completly dominated by l.a. county , and northern california would do the same , but might declare itself the state of jefferson instead . 
  in short , california is more likely to divide into itself before it divides away from the country . 
  and the supreme court would be the one to determine the un-constitutionality of that . 
  it only becomes tyranny if congress or the president ignore said ruling or move to depose of the supreme court . 
  hence that whole checks & balances thing . 
  and as i 've said , it makes it harder . 
  you do n't need to always win , just make life such a bitch that you finally get some shit like the good friday agreement in northern ireland . 
  winning would be pretty cool though . 
  oh , and tell me , after almost two decades , how close are anti-western & jihadist insurgencies in the middle east to being wiped out & no longer threatening the local governments ? 
  it 's not really tyrannical until the checks & balances are violated . 
  the 2nd ammendmemt is more of a failsafe meant to never be needed than a tool meant to be used freely in that regard . 
  and ... are you seriously arguing that armed guerillas embedded through-out the local population & using ieds ar n't capable of carrying out a effective insurgency ? 
  lol especially in the context of what would likely already be a divided u.s. military who 's inevitably going to cause collateral damage ? 
  i mean , i 'm not saying they 'd win ... but seriously dude ? 
  lol you just underestimate that type of shit so easily ? 
  i 'm ... ugh ... pretty sure you can ... if history is any judge ... and ... uhm ... pretty sure that can still work too if the rather sizeable number of effective insurgencies through-out the modern era are any judge ... 
  maybe not , but it sure as shit does n't make it easier . 
  lol, 
  what was happening in europe when that was happening in america ? 
  no , and as we all know , europe has never had a bad history with oppressed minorities or tyrannical governments . 
   disregarding the uselessness of gun control in reducing terror attacks why ... why would you ignore that ? 
  terrorists are literally the excuse they used to ram this through ... 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  with 6-year terms & entire states to represent , they 're not exactly the 2-year crowded clusterfuck that goes on downstairs .
