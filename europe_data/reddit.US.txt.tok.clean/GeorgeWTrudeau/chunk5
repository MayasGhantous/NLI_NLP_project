  plus it went a long way in deepening north american relations , helping maintain a stable , friendly continent for america to project it 's influence from . 
  niether did trump , and i know you can agree with me there . 
  i mean , what kind of idiot would vote for a man who tried to de-legitimize the judiciary by saying a judge could n't judge him because of race & talked about how rulings should n't be taken seriously because of * `` activist judges '' * ? 
  someboy who tried to de-legitimize the legislature by saying they were all corrupt & not to be trusted or respected ? 
  who de-legitimized the election itself by saying it was all rigged ? 
  somebody who even talked about creating a massive surviellance operation to monitor millions of american citizens just because of their religion ? 
  who could support a man who called the free press a enemy of the people & actually had his chief of staff seriously discuss changing the first ammendment ? 
  somebody who supported torture ? 
  especially when he 's held up by a angry , populist mob obsessing over a strongman personality cult . 
  no self-respecting patriotic american who cares for the very foundations of this republic would . 
  they 'd be fucking retarded to do so . 
  lol i mean , what was that old saying again ? 
  * `` america'a tyrant will come wrapped in a flag & carrying a bible '' * ? 
  she campaigned her ass off . 
  lol where the fuck were you for the election ? 
  and yeah , those people are responsible for trump . 
  nobody deserves or owns their vote . 
  so the consequences of where it ends up is completely on them . 
  what does that mean ? 
  lol if you thought i was talking about a embargo than you better brush up on your reading comprension skills . 
  we 'll still be trading with asia , and that competition will be a driving factor in what i 'm talking about . 
  two very different political & economic systems are going to be clashing more & more for influence & dominance not only in asia , but the world as well over the next century . 
  state-based capitalism against free market-based capialism , liberal democracies against illiberal authoritarians . 
  i 'd rather not handicapp our side before things even heat up , not when it has the potential to so severly compromise the national interests of us & our allies . 
  an never underestimate the effect a type of economic & political system can have on a country 's national interests , and never forget that war is just politics by any other means . 
  so even without war , that rivalry & competition is still there . 
  what part of the only people responsible for who becomes president are the voters do you not understand ? 
  clinton did n't deserve any votes . 
  and that 's why many of the people who did n't give them to her , whether because they wanted to vote stein or write-in bernie , are at fault for trump being president . 
  do n't get on a pedestal & lecture about how nobody owns your vote & how you 're going to vote your concious instead of for the * `` lesser evil '' * , but than try to avoid taking responsbility for the consequences of your vote when the chickens come home to roost . 
  well ... it 's not meaningless ... it 's a overall net gain ... 
  they get due process & a trial by a jury of their peers . 
  i 'm not a particulary religious man so i believe if there is any authority in this world capable of authorizing the taking of a life for a crime it 's the independent judiciary of a liberal democracy . 
  nor do i see how locking somebody up in a cage for the rest of their life is much of huge civilized leap in comparison . 
  but regardless , i find a court-authorized death penalty to be more civilized & fair than a european fighter bombing some random jihadi to death in bum fuck nowhere , which a number of eu countries are doing as we speak . 
  i do n't think you 're a uncivilized barbarian though or the same as trump for it . 
  i support the death penalty so eh . 
  boy , if you hate the right so much & do n't think europe is big enough for both sides of the aisle , than the eu is fucked . 
  not when the amount of people who voted for stein there outstripped the difference in votes between clinton & trump . 
  and i literally just said we deserve trump . 
  did you miss that or some shit ? 
  lol, 
   obama not being able to get a 3rd term because of short-sighted bullshit idealism ** after fdr ** really fucked us in the ass . 
  i was criticising the politicians who constitutionally prohibited 2 + term presidencies after fdr in response to his 4 term wins . 
  i was n't shitting on fdr himself . 
  lol, 
  once again , you realize there is a good chunk of countries in the eu without single-payer healthcare & with tution fees , right ? 
  do they not really have universal healthcare ? 
  are they not really european ? 
  are you going to kick them out of the eu ? 
  ** and once again , what is your point ? 
  lol i did n't suggest the united states should join the eu & did n't threaten to send her to europe . 
  also do n't understand how it justifies trump . 
  no , most of them just looked at her & trump and decided to help trump win . 
  lol you got to be a grown adult to vote & we have both the internet & 24/7 cable news now . 
  i 'm not going to treat the electorate like they 're children or retarded . 
  we 're mature enough with enough access to information that those excuses do n't really stand anymore . 
   guy thinks fdr fucked over us actually the opposite . 
  how the fuck did you come to that conclusion ? 
  lol, 
  she pretty strongly supported & championed universal healthcare ... as well as subsidized primary/secondary education ... 
  but as for higher education , she was for easing the college debt burden , but the main problem really is the economics of it . 
  which is a massive burden in a already indebted country with a deficit . 
  are there no tuition fees at all in europe anywhere & is every country single-payer ? 
  also , keep in mind , it 's states that run & subsidize all the public universities , not the federal government , which in itself has already been plaqued , as i pointed out above , with a pretty big debt load & deficit . 
  ** but , anyway , wtf does this have to do with anything i just talked about in the context of fucking trump & the american election ? 
  lol did i threaten to send her to europe or some shit ? 
  like ... what 's your point ? 
  because she was n't charismatic & had the scars that every expierienced politician or statesman gets after years in office . 
  the type of shit you get through compromising on things you want for things need , and working with shitty people to achieve non-shitty things . 
  but if so many people in this country can look at trump & clinon , and * still * think it 's a good idea to not vote , vote stein or write-in bernie , than this country can get fucked . 
  the burden of trump 's presidency & her loss is n't on clinton , it 's on the voters , the ones who actually looked at the options before them & decided the winner . 
  an ai n't no idealistic bullshit about how somebody voted their concious because they did n't get the perfect candidate with the perfect record is going to fix that . 
  trump is so fucking stupid for pulling out of the tpp . 
  and fuck bernie 's dumb populist ass for helping him do it too . 
  obama not being able to get a 3rd term because of short-sighted bullshit idealism after fdr really fucked us in the ass . 
  ** edit : ** also , to be real , i 'm not even jealous of the eu deal . 
  i 'm happy about it . 
  the eu is a free marketed-based liberal democracy . 
  this is something i actually support & think is in our own long-term national interests despite how many on both sides want to turn it into a rivalry . 
  but it does n't offer the western world & it 's allies half of what the tpp offered . 
  and now china , with it 's state capitalism-based , illiberal authoritarian bullshit , is about to economically dick down the pacific bareback at the expense of us & our allies . 
  i 'm just so fucking tired of the angry , mob-mentality populist bullshit shooting this country in the foot at every turn . 
  between the wannabe fascists on the right with trump & the wannabe socialists on the left with bernie dominating the national dialouge every second of the day , while moderates like clinton are dogpiled on by both & ostrasized , i 'm just done dude . 
  lol, 
  tbf , i 've seen scandinavians & europeans do it just as much . 
  hell , i remember ** this sub ** mocking the american opposition to socialism politically & culturally , talking about how * `` it works '' * in europe , cheering bernie on when he proudly labelled himself a socialist & demanded political revolution . 
  you even had a bunch of scandinavian redditors openly phonebanking for bernie during the primary & bernie 's campaign catching heat from the fec for a bunch of campaign donations from european natonals . 
  however i will personally never not be amused by berniebros calling for socialist revolution against * `` filthy capitalists * '' like obama , so a part of me hopes the trend continues . 
  tbf , he said it in 1855 , about 6 years before both the civil war started & the serfs were emancipated . 
  canada was pretty much losing by the time the war ended . 
  america had stopped the canadian militia from attacking northern states by repulsing the invasion fleet at plattsburgh on lake champlain , utterly destroyed the canadian provincial marine on lake erie , re-captured detroit from canadian miltia , drove canadian militia from york * ( present-day toronto ) * , the then capital of upper canada , burning it down , and then proceeded to shatter the first nation coalition allied with canada in ontario at the battle of the thames . 
  of course , british regulars & the royal navy played a much bigger & leading role than the canadian militia & provincial marine in all of the above , but it was still the only front canada was really involved in it 's self . 
  there were n't any canadian militia , for example , marching on places like washington dc . 
  those were british veterans , fresh from europe & deployed from bases in bermuda . 
  tbf , you did n't give them representation in westminister either , and dragged your feet on guranteed , constitutional autonomy as well . 
  but you did start using kiddie gloves when dealing with anglo-based colonies & began tolerating a lot more from them as well in a bid to avoid a repeat of the american revolution though . 
  however the [ ** imperial federation ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperial_federation ) * was * pushed at the turn of the 20th century in a attempt to remedy the former points & solidify the british empire permanantly , but strong quebecois opposition in canada & opposition at home over being governed in large part by colonials put a end to that . 
  if britain just guranteed some constitutional/federal autonomy & gave the colonies some representation in westminister , the whole thing probably could 've been avoided , and the british empire might 've survived to this day as a anglosphere-wide superpower . 
  always interesting to look back on how compromising the founding fathers were trying to be & the effort they put into trying to remain british subjects .
