  tbf , is n't it the same with anti-americanism in europe ? 
  that reminds of a old quote from 1835 :  there are at the present time two great nations in the world , which started from different points , but seem to tend towards the same end . 
  i allude to the russians and the americans . 
  both of them have grown up unnoticed ; and whilst the attention of mankind was directed elsewhere , they have suddenly placed themselves in the front rank among the nations , and the world learned their existence and their greatness at almost the same time . 
   all other nations seem to have nearly reached their natural limits , and they have only to maintain their power ; but these are still in the act of growth . 
  all the others have stopped , or continue to advance with extreme difficulty ; these alone are proceeding with ease and celerity along a path to which no limit can be perceived . 
  the american struggles against the obstacles which nature opposes to him ; the adversaries of the russian are men . 
  the former combats the wilderness and savage life ; the latter , civilization with all its arms . 
  the conquests of the american are therefore gained with the ploughshare ; those of the russian by the sword . 
  the anglo-american relies upon personal interest to accomplish his ends , and gives free scope to the unguided strength and common sense of the people ; the russian centres all the authority of society in a single arm . 
  the principal instrument of the former is freedom ; of the latter , servitude . 
  their starting-point is different , and their courses are not the same ; yet each of them seems marked out by the will of heaven to sway the destinies of half the globe . 
  [ ** - alexis de tocqueville ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexis_de_tocqueville ) was always kinda impressed that somebody said that more than a century before the cold war came about . 
  but the french always tend to drop some premonition from time to time :  china ? 
  there lies a sleeping giant . 
  let him sleep , for when he wakes he will move the world . 
  yeah , but de gaulle thought that the so called [ ** `` father of europe '' ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean_monnet ) and president of the european coal & steel community was a trojan horse for american interests too , trying to build a federal europe to weaken france 's power . 
  a lot of redditors seemed surprise by corbyn 's reaction , but they really should n't have been if they paid any attention to corbyn 's political career & ideological roots . 
  the man has been a euroskeptic for more than three decades , basically the entire time he 's been in office . 
  his defense of remain was pitiful & almost forced . 
  he 's a hold-over from pre-blair old-school labour . 
  the anti-eu type . 
  the ones who saw the european union as a neoliberal construct , who 's creation during the cold war was driven by the bastion of capitalism itself , america , to oppose socialists . 
  which , tbf : [ ** american committee on united europe ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_committee_on_united_europe )  the american committee on united europe ( * acue * ) , founded in 1948 , was an american organization which sought to counter the communist threat in europe by promoting european political integration . 
  its first chairman was ex-wartime oss head william joseph donovan . 
   _________  declassified american government documents have shown that the acue was an important early funder of both the european movement and the european youth campaign . 
   ________  the u.s. policy was to promote a united states of europe , and to this end the committee was used to discreetly funnel cia funds - by the mid 50 's acue was receiving roughly $ 1,000,000 usd per year - to european pro-federalists supporting such organizations as the council of europe , the european coal and steel community , and the proposed european defence community . 
   the end of an article appearing in the daily telegraph in september 2000 noted that : '' * the state department also played a role . 
  a memo from the european section , dated june 11 , 1965 , advises the vice-president of the european economic community , robert marjolin , to pursue monetary union by stealth . 
  it recommends suppressing debate until the point at which `` adoption of such proposals would become virtually inescapable '' * . 
  [ ** as well as this which goes into more detail than wikipedia : ** ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/27/the-european-union-always-was-a-cia-project-as-brexiteers-discov/ )  the schuman declaration that set the tone of franco-german reconciliation - and would lead by stages to the european community - was cooked up by the us secretary of state dean acheson at a meeting in foggy bottom . 
  '' * it all began in washington , * '' said robert schuman 's chief of staff . 
   it was the truman administration that browbeat the french to reach a modus vivendi with germany in the early post-war years , even threatening to cut off us marshall aid at a furious meeting with recalcitrant french leaders they resisted in september 1950 . 
   ________  for british eurosceptics , jean monnet looms large in the federalist pantheon , the emminence grise of supranational villainy . 
  few are aware that he spent much of his life in america , and served as war-time eyes and ears of franklin roosevelt . 
   general charles de gaulle thought him an american agent , as indeed he was in a loose sense . 
  eric roussel 's biography of monnet reveals how he worked hand in glove with successive administrations . 
   it is odd that this magisterial 1000-page study has never been translated into english since it is the best work ever written about the origins of the eu . 
   nor are many aware of declassified documents from the state department archives showing that us intelligence funded the european movement secretly for decades , and worked aggressively behind the scenes to push britain into the project . 
   as this newspaper first reported when the treasure became available , one memorandum dated july 26 , 1950 , reveals a campaign to promote a full-fledged european parliament . 
  it is signed by gen william j donovan , head of the american wartime office of strategic services , precursor of the central inteligence agency . 
   the key cia front was the american committee for a united europe ( * acue * ) , chaired by donovan . 
  another document shows that it provided 53.5 per cent of the european movement 's funds in 1958 . 
  the board included walter bedell smith and allen dulles , cia directors in the fifties , and a caste of ex-oss officials who moved in and out of the cia . 
   papers show that it treated some of the eu 's ' * founding fathers * ' as hired hands , and actively prevented them finding alternative funding that would have broken reliance on washington . 
   labour has sacked three shadow ministers who joined dozens of their colleagues in defying the party to back a queen 's speech amendment calling for britain to remain in the single market and customs union . 
   _____  by voting the rebels defied the labour leader , who has committed to ending free movement of eu citizens and leaving the single market . 
  france is now the globalist & america is now the protectionist . 
  and only one year after the latter had a neoliberal for president & the former had a socialist for president . 
  for fucks sake . 
  well , i mean , it was going around the same time we launched that coup in iran ... and that 's never forgotten or treated like it 's too far in the past ... an i 've seen , at least personally , way more americans recognize both our historical & modern faults than the dutch their 's . 
  in fact , you almost seem to know more about our history & mistakes than your own from what i 've seen . 
  kinda makes me wonder if most of you even know that you used to have colonies ot the horror that happened there . 
  but anyway ... lol ... ai n't shit tax-related in america compares to wtf you got going on . 
  alright , hundreds of years of pillaging indonesia & murdering the natives , but than not giving them any welfare or casinos when you fuck off . 
  ar n't ... ar n't french companies fracking the shit out of francafrique as we speak ? 
  and ... did n't your country give us fucking royal dutch shell of all things ? 
  lol not to mention that whole tax haven thing ... 
  jesus christ sweden . 
  your va is even worse than ours . 
  i do n't know about the others , and i really like macron , but the whole france patting itself on the back for banning fracking was ridiculos . 
  french companies have been mining the shit out of their former african colonies to fuel france since those countries got indepedence . 
  serious french fracking was never going to happen in france , it was always going to happen across the mediterranean ... hell ... it is happening across the mediterranean as we speak . 
  i would 've taken the shit much more serious if macron levied fines on french companies for fracking abroad , or made his anti-fracking campaign a multilateral approach in cooperation with francafrique . 
  this is almost as funny as when france did it . 
  and the only reason france was funnier was because everybody knew french companies were already across the mediteranian working on fracking francafrique to feed france , as has been the dynamic for ... fuck ... awhile now ... 
  and yet , socialists always end up siezing them ... and then setting up a dictatorship ... 
  what , exactly , do you think communism 's view of private property is ? 
  lol, 
  some of it , probably about half , since whites are/were pretty evenly divided between repulicans & democrats . 
  kinda the reason the 2nd ammendment was put in there when you think about it . 
  i 'm not sure iraqi kurdistan would agree with you , nor am i sure the sunni awakening would 've been possible without that dynamic . 
  [ ** we stay strapped . 
  ** ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/15/the-demographics-and-politics-of-gun-owning-households/ ) it 's pretty well-balanced across the country regionally . 
  minorities in general have been a [ ** pretty big factor ** ] ( https://www.usacarry.com/gun-ownership-ccps-up-women-minorities/ ) * ( concealed carry permits increased about 75 % more for them compared to whites over the past decade ) * in driving recent [ ** gun ownership ** ] ( http://www.npr.org/2015/04/02/396869889/more-african-americans-support-carrying-legal-guns-for-self-defense ) as well :  according to a survey by the pew research center , 54 percent of blacks now see gun ownership as a good thing , something more likely to protect than harm . 
   ________  at another black church , greater st. matthew baptist , pastor david bullock points out the pews that where his armed congregants usually sit . 
   '' * the chairman of my deacon board , he carries , * '' bullock says . 
  '' * and then on the west side , there 's a middle-aged woman who also carries . 
  * '' and [ ** trump ** ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/us/african-american-gun-club-trump/index.html ) is having the same type of effect on the black community that obama had on rednecks :  the national african-american gun club has doubled its membership since election day , and gun sellers say they 've noticed more black customers buying firearms . 
   at stoddard 's range and guns in atlanta , one thunderous clap after another reverberates through the room , mixing with laughter and the smell of gunpowder . 
  a group of men are bonding over a hobby they love . 
  moments later , their weapons empty and a stream of hot shell casings on the floor around them , each man holds up his target showing clusters of bullet holes . 
   they are members of the national african american gun association , a group that has added 9,000 members since election day , said philip smith , the group 's national president . 
  the group launched on feb. 28 , 2015 , and added 4,285 members over the same time period the year before , between nov. 2015 and feb. 2016 . 
   '' * i 'd be lying to you if i said donald trump has n't affected our numbers , * '' smith said . 
  '' * they have jumped off the roof . 
  * ''  naaga now has more than 18,000 members in 24 chapters across the country . 
   __________  but that does n't deter naaga 's growing membership . 
  they say the second amendment should be for all americans and it 's a freedom they plan to exercise and encourage . 
   ____________  group meetings across the country focus on teaching new gun owners each state 's gun laws , and helping first-time gun owners feel comfortable with their weapons . 
   michael cargill , the owner of a gun shop in central texas , said a group of 100 black women had recently called asking him to set up a class on gun safety and the proper way to shoot . 
   he attributed the recent wave of interest in owning a firearm to a few factors . 
  '' * because of the climate in the white house ... people in the african-american community and other communities are concerned about their safety * , '' he said . 
  '' * i 'm seeing people who want to learn how to shoot and then have us help shop for the right gun . 
  * ''  '' * it 's something that i have n't seen in years past , * '' he said . 
  i never meant to imply it was a gurantee against tyranny . 
  only a useful tool that affords you more options than otherwise . 
  and in insurgency type situation , you do n't so much have to win battles as stay causing problems long enough to force negotiations or set a precedent . 
  but once again , not a gurantee . 
  they 'd still probably would 've been fucked when the soviets & nazis imposed their regimes , though , at least personally , i 'd rather more citizens be armed in that scenario than otherwise ... do n't got ta make it easier for tyranny & oppression even if it 's a losing struggle ...
