  i will enlighten you later comrade , but first let us finish up work at the cooperative before we return to the commune . 
  it 's because socialism sounds great on paper . 
  but than you try to implement it ... and between trying to abolish private property , collectivize , re-distribute wealth , maintain the dictatorship of the proliteriat and outlaw the very idea of hustle in itself ... a lot of those guns start pointing the wrong way & becoming a liability ... 
  it hurts to agree with socialists on things , but marx had a point . 
  i am quite relieved , however , by the knowledge that after siezing power , socialists pretty much always become dictators & immediately begin confiscating all the guns again , so my smugness is still preserved in a way . 
  hey , that 's not very fair . 
  the far-right fascists occupying poland did n't much like polish citizens owning guns either . 
  the far-left socialists that came after were just upholding a time-honored tradition . 
  partisans tied down a lot of forces for rear security & caused a lot of logistical nightmares in wwii , not to mention benefits from things like intel gathering . 
  an i also find it odd that you 're forgetting about the effectiveness of countless communist rebels , jihadi insurgents & ira guerillas through-out the modern period , even when facing the counter-insurgency campaigns of modern nations or even taking place in modern nations * ( also , just for reference , i 'm not a radical jihadi communist who advocates for war against great britain , nor somebody who supports those things ) * and the thing about that kinda conflict is that you do n't so much need to win battles as create enough of a bother to either force the otherside to the negotiating table or set a precedent for the goverment to actively try & avoid creating the same kind of conditions that led to the situation in the first place . 
   state monopoly on use of force which , as i pointed out before in this sub , seems like a good idea at first , because when things are going good , it 's good , but when you look at history , when things go bad in that context , ** they go very bad ** . 
  and as i also pointed out before , it 's kinda the same logic used for free market economics democratizing the government 's monoply on greed when compared to state capitalism/communism . 
  and poland is probably one of the last countries that need to be reminded how shit state capitalism/communism can end up . 
  i mean , yes , greed & the capability to use force are scary prospects , and their prevalence will result in additional deaths from gun violence & inequalities in income distribution , but it 's those type of freedoms , economic & the capability to use force , which in the long-term , are some of the best hedges against tyranny . 
  it 's a sacerfice to maintain them , but if history is any guide , if poland 's history is any guide , tyranny can kill & do more damage in a much shorter time with much longer consequences than otherwise . 
  and do n't get me wrong ; personally , i support a strong , centralized government , with universal healthcare , a strong social safety net & healthy economic regulation . 
  but , as a trade-off for all that , i like to have a strong 2nd ammendment , if not for any other reason but as a deadman 's switch should our checks & balances fail or the state be incapable of protecting me & my family for some reason . 
  and while i do n't see that seriously happening anytime soon , even with trump , i do n't know wtf the country is going to look like a generation or two , or three , or more , from now . 
  they protected something with it , but it sure as shit did n't make it easier for us . 
  i do n't like them & hope we eventually come out on top , but i 'm not going to lie and say that small arms with ieds do n't make shit harder for the otherside . 
  hence why i do n't really understand when others try to say that the shit would n't be at all effective in the context of a tyrannical government siezing power . 
  you mean when you skip over the semi-automatic & magazine ban and only point out the regime of extra regulations ? 
  when it comes to the long-term & constitutional thinking , i 'm not sure reliance on a libyan dictator & the overseas disappora in a country which enshrines gun rights should be counted on as a given ...  if things go very bad , gun laws are totally irrelevant . 
  well , yeah , which is why you probably should n't disarm everybody before it get 's bad ... lol ... proliferation takes awhile to both establish & get rid of ... you should n't make it easier for a tyrannical government before they even get in the door ... 
   the firearms directive moves a single category of firearms ( semiautomatic firearms with magazines of a certain size ) to the prohibited category , rather than the restricted category . 
   ________  but this does n't really have anything to do with being a gun-owner . 
   _______  yes yes , this is a restriction of your `` rights '' to shoot semiautomatic weapons one of these things is not like the others . 
  how many failed counter-insurgency campaigns by modern nations in third-world shitholes have we had ? 
  a good bit . 
  an even if you do n't win against a tyrannical government or have no hope of winning , guns can afford a oppressed populace two things : * survival as a nuisance long enough to force serious negotiations , where you being armed will offer your side more leverage * cause a costly enough insurgency or rebellion that the precedent after it 's put down will cause the goverment to try & avoid helping create the type of harsh , oppressive conditions that led to it happening in the first place and even if those do n't work ... than still ... at least you had a better chance than otherwise , whether talking outright success , negotations or setting a precedent . 
  but i mean , are we really going to pretend that even somewhere like modern europe , home of the ira , that such a force can not exert large political influence even when being being strained to mostly small arms & ieds ? 
  and i do n't even like nor support the ira , but i 'll be damned if they were n't effective & capable of forcing negotiations in a way where their side specifically had more leverage because of their actions & armament . 
  but i get it , there will be mistakes & criminals in any country which allows guns . 
  more people will die from gun violence in countries with private gun ownership . 
  however , you begin to notice , through-out history , that when states have a monoply on violence with total gun control & things are good , they go good , but when they go bad , ** they go very bad ** . 
  it 's the same thing with state capitalism , when it goes good , it goes good , but when it goes bad , ** it goes very bad ** . 
  i 've personally always liked a happy medium . 
  some gun rights to go with my gun control & some free market to go with my economic regulation . 
   check out the criminality statistics in pre-war poland for instance well ... yeah ... authoritarian regimes who rule with a iron fist tend to be pretty hard on crime . 
  who would 've thought ...  i do n't know what was the original motive of the polish communist government when they restricted gun ownership lol really ? 
  you do n't know why a undemocratic authoritarian regime would want to restrict gun ownership in the citizenry ? 
  well , when it comes to constitutional principles & the broader political context , it does act as a sorta deadman 's switch against a tyrannical government should a government 's checks & balances fail , as well as a type of last line of defense should the government be unable to protect you for some reason . 
  think of it as kinda democratisizing the government 's monoply on violence , in the same way something like free market economics democratizes the government 's monoply on greed when compared to state capitalism/communism . 
  i know that 's a unpopular line of thought here , but eh . 
  my personal belief is that sports & recreational hunting ar n't a good enough justification by themselves for such dangerous weapons specifically designed to kill , and if we start going down that way of thinking we 're basically treating them as toys , which i ca n't really agree with to be honest . 
  which is fine , but * what * laws specifically ? 
  and based on the violation of * what * treaty in particular ? 
  because , as what happened with nicragau , even if you completely ignore the united states rejecting the ijc 's jurisdiction & pretty much boycotting the case , you 're still going to be left with the entire judgement being based around * `` international customary law '' * , not for violations of any particular treaty that america agreed to uphold . 
  a good portion of the american public is wary about the relationship between international organizations & sovereignty to begin with . 
  so it 's even harder for them to take a international court seriously when it 's judgement does n't involve any codified laws or specific treaties that the united states has signed & ratified , but rather depends on general custom as a international body , who 's jurisdiction the government has n't even recongnized from the start , defines it . 
  which is a justifiable argument , but also one which is a minefield * ( ironically enough , also the subject of a un convention that the u.s. has refused to sign & ratify ) * . 
  questions of sovereignty tend to get pretty big when you can start dragging unwilling countries before courts with jurisdictions they do n't recongnize for violating uncodified laws tied to no particular treaty they ever signed & ratified , using no legislative authority other than general custom to justify it . 
  unlike china , with the nicaragua case , the united states refused to acknowledge the ijc 's jurisdiction on the matter & pretty much boycotted the case during it 's deliberation . 
  and also unlike china , the ijc was basing it 's judgement there on * `` customary international law '' * , not on any particular treaty that america was a member of . 
  china , otoh , signed & ratified unclos , which the court was basing it 's case on , volunteered approval for the ijc to have jurisdiction on the manner , and heavily participated in the case until it 's judgement . 
   of course , if you are a world power like us or china and get away with breaches of international law all the time , then it is very tempting just to ignore the law . 
  tbf , using the united states ' logic , ca n't breach the law if you never signed , or ratified , the un treaty/convention in the first place , let alone volunteered yourself before the courts . 
  hence all the unsigned ... or signed , but not ratified ... un treaties/conventions that the united states has had piling up over the decades , it 's refusal to join the icc & reluctance to ever volunteer itself before the icj willingly . 
  kinda amusing though . 
  you now have the u.s. navy trying to enforce unclos in the south china sea , despite it 's country having neither signed nor ratified it , while the chinese navy is attempting to defy it , despite it 's country having signed , ratified & submitted itself for icj judgement on it . 
  tbf , back in the early 2000s china allowed the icj to judge unclos-related territorial disputes in the south china sea , but pretty much told it to suck a dick [ ** last year ** ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/13/china-damns-international-court-after-south-china-sea-slapdown ) when the court ruled against them on unclos-related territorial disputes in the south china sea , delivering what would 've been * ( if china actually abided by it ) * a pretty huge victory to the phillipines & serious precedent for the region . 
  so i guess it really comes down to not joining so you do n't have to be binded by rulings * ( ala the united states ) * , or joining & just not giving a shit about the rulings * ( ala china ) * . 
  there 's probably a good debate in there to argue what side 's approach is worse . 
  however , it does raise some questions . 
  like , if the international community ca n't even get countries who signed & ratified un treaties , and then voluntarily submitted themselves to icj judgement , to honor the court 's rulings , than wtf is the point of now dragging countries not bound by any specific treaty * ( that i 'm aware of ) * & openly not cooperating before the icj ? 
  is it just america that believes socialism represents trying to sieze the means of production and begin the process of abolishing private property & re-distributing wealth in egalitarian fashion along cooperative/communal lines ? 
  because i do believe that 's the commonly accepted definition of socialism ... and the goal of the vast majority of socialists from around the world & through-out history ... 
  but , i do admit , many americans are stupid enough , on both the left with bernie & right with trump , to believe somewhere like scandinavia is socialist ... which is a bit odd ... considering that they not only tolerate private ownership , free market-based economics , corporate driven growth & free trade with other capitalist countries , but actively encourage it as well , having shown no hint or motivation what-so-ever for seriously trying to sieze the means of production & begin the process of radical economic revolution which socialism calls for ... are ... are you sure that * you 're not the one * with the very american view of socialism ? 
  lol, 
  i thought that the worldwide collapse of most socialist states in the early 90s would 've disproved that ... 
  i mean ... after a striaght century of socialist governments failing in dozens of countries , on almost every continent , and pretty consistently causing widespread poverty , agricultural collapse & authoritaran regimes , i find it rather amusing that you contend that * capitalism * is the * real * failure . 
  lol doubly so in the context of wtf is going down in venezuela right now as we speak . 
  but i must ask you , given your flair , how do you feel about the eu being what 's pretty much a neoliberal construct ? 
  who 's creation was largely encouraged by the capitalist united states to oppose soviet-backed socialism ? 
  when we helped flood eastern europe with foreign aid after the wall came down , helped push them into joining both the eu & nato , helped support the introduction of the euro , helped provide liquidity to eu banks through a backdoor with our stimulus package during the great recession , helped back the eu to counter russia with ukraine & asked britain to reject brexit ? 
  well , yeah , but i feel like he was still trying to get across a certain point with it , even if it was exagerated . 
  it 's called communication bruv ** edit : ** as the long debate with op below goes to show , told you so . 
  lol, 
  tbf , we helped drive the creation of both the eu & modern-day international system that you hold dear . 
  as well as help disassemble europe 's colonial empires . 
  sure , we did both because it was in our national interests * ( as every country does ) * , but when europe was in the same position it ... caused two of the bloodiest & most destructive conflicts in all of human history , needing america 's help to end both . 
  plus , you know , that whole oppressing the vast majority of the world under imperialist colonial constructs thing . 
  so ... i think our track record is pretty good in comparison ... even as europeans like to downplay their history & deny the massive part america directly paid in their modern-day geopolitical unity/achievements . 
  i guess it makes you uncomfortable or some shit . 
  it 's a glass house with a two-way mirror pointed inwards . 
  they 're seen as people in germany too . 
  that 's why you can sue them , legal personhood . 
  i dare you to link a spaced out url proving that i 'm a t_d supporter . 
  i * think * i 'm banned there , and i gurantee you if there * is a post * , it 'll be clear why i would be . 
  otherwise stop talking bullshit . 
  well that 's easily disproven . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  federal judges are appointed for life & have a pretty damn respected reputation , not to mention any prosecutor would jump at the chance to bring down a massive corporate conspiracy , ** domestic or foreign ** , that 's a career maker . 
  i mean wtf , why are you trying to downplay what volkswagen did & justify not seriously prosecuting people who committed massive nationwide fraud to undermine enviromental regulations ? 
  what was wrong or * `` special '' * about the enviromental regulations these men violated ? 
  why is it wrong to want to prosecute them for it ? 
  no wonder germans are willing to throw eastern europe under the bus for nord stream 2 with the fucked mentality being spammed & upvoted in this thread . 
  lol, 
  well , while we 're on it : https://rwer.wordpress.com/2013/03/23/deutsche-bank-fifty-shades-of-fraud/, 
  than why do n't you start ?
