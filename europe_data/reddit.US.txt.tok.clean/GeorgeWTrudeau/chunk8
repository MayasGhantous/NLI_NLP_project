  really ? 
  like half my post history is just me shitting on trump & talking about the dangers of his populist wannabe tyrant bullshit . 
  like ... how did you even arrive at that shit ? 
  lol, 
  because i 'm not ? 
  america is doing kinda shit right now too if yiu have n't noticed . 
  alright , let 's talk scale . 
  the eu 's economy is bigger than america 's & it 's corporations are in pretty much every developed country , and in many cases , are taking advantage of past colonial relationships , aided by their own intelligence agencies . 
  is most of africa , the middle east & massive chunks of latin america & asia a big enough scale for you . 
  you 're just as bad as america & spread out across the entire world as america , and when you look at how european corporations have operated in a number of african countries , even worse many a time . 
  and what do you mean at least europe * `` pretends '' * ? 
  america is the largest spender on foreign aid . 
  only way you get such a fuckton of africa loving george bush . 
  i mean , how about all the humanitarian missions by the u.s. military after massive natural disasters ? 
  all those corporate foundations & billionaires like gates & buffet basically giving away their fortunes to the 3rd world ? 
  does that scale ? 
  lol lol an how is google & microsoft not just a result of europe not investing enough in r&d or risking enough in silicon valley ? 
  those companies were n't stolen from europe , they were born in silicon valley , and they did n't get big by taking advantage of the european market , but by competing in the american market . 
  while america was innovating for the digital age , europe was ignoring it . 
  and now you wan na complain about that like it 's a colonial relationship which caused this dynamic ? 
  seriously ? 
  lol that argument does n't even stand . 
  you had the people , you had the money , and you had the freedom to take advantage of both , but you did n't , and now you 're pissed you do n't have a foot in the door , so you 're trying everything you can to destroy those companies with government intervention & targetted overregulation . 
  has europe put out a warrant for george bush ? 
   the r&d numbers as an eu average are misleading , as they include countries from finland ( 3.2 % of gdp ) to romania ( .4 % of gdp ) . 
  the nordics ( except for iceland ) , germany , austria , and switzerland in particular have higher numbers . 
  which is fine , but the eu as a whole still has a larger economy than america , but is only matching about 70 % of america 's r&d spending in absolute terms . 
   venture capital is a less interesting statistic ; while there 's probably too little venture capital spending in europe , the other extreme is not necessarily better . 
  see uber burning through vc money : they 're not promoting a better technology , they 've been trying to establish a monopoly position using predatory practices funded by vc . 
  alright , let 's assume that . 
  you then have [ ** lyft ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lyft ) , recently valued at about $ 7.5 billion after having raised about $ 2.61 billion in funding , to challenge uber , force it to innovate & overtake it should it fail . 
  and in this new industry which uber & lyft are pioneering , for better or for worse , where are the european corporations ? 
  where are the european risktakers investing in them ? 
  in ten years , if not sooner , uber & lyft will be in the same position that companies like google are in now . 
  europe did n't take the risk , europe did n't get it 's foot in the door to begin with , and now europe is jealous , and because europe is so far behind in a industry which tends to build upon itself , instead of taking the risk nessecarry to compensate , it 's going to play it safe & just try to striaght up destroy the american pioneers with government intervention so europeans do n't have to trailblaze , aleady having a established industry they can take advantage of thanks to silicon valley 's hard work . 
   the us did it everywhere , even in europe but not really though , otherwise one could contend that europe has been doing the same in america because american corporate practices in europe ar n't much different than european corporate practices in america . 
   europe did it in mostly africa and some parts of asia . 
  and the middle east . 
  and latin america . 
  anywhere you used to have colonies * ( aka , the rest of the god damned world ) * . 
  hell , germany did n't even really have colonies , and they were still fucking around in places like argentina . 
   the us just buys off other companies with money . 
  scandalous . 
   and i was rather thinking about corporate dumping and corrupted practices done by far too many us corporations . 
  united fruit company , exxon mobil to mention two ... alright , but how 's that much different from french corporations dicking down francafrique ? 
  it was sarcasm . 
  lol, 
  you ... ugh ... realize german banks were guilty & implicated for the mortage crisis too ... [ ** right ** ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/110316/european-banking-crisis-explained-db.asp?lgl=myfinance-layout-no-ads#deutsche ) ? 
  lol, 
  once again ... read the link ... you realize that german banks were implicated in the mortage crisis too ... right ? 
  lol, 
  we outcompete in tech because we spend the most on r&d and risk the most on venture capital . 
   [ *** research & development ( ppp ) *** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_research_and_development_spending )  * ** united states ** - 2.74 % of gdp * ( $ 473.4 billion ) * / $ 1,442.51 per capita  * ** european union ** - 1.94 % of gdp * ( $ 334.3 billion ) * / $ 657.48 per capita  [ *** venture capital investment *** ] ( https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/which-countries-have-the-most-venture-capital-investments/ )  * ** united states ** - .3 % of gdp ( * $ 52.1 billion * ) / $ 163.29 per capita  * ** european union ** - .06 % of gdp ( * $ 10.6 billion * ) / $ 21 per capita otherwise german lobbyists would 've been able to come up with a better plan than literally just calling for the destruction of google by parliamentary resolution . 
  lol, 
  idk , how many [ ** german bankers ** ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/110316/european-banking-crisis-explained-db.asp?lgl=myfinance-layout-no-ads#deutsche ) did germany arrest for helping cause it given their huge involvement in it ? 
  not to mention the foreign exchange manipulation ... money laundering for russian oligarchs ... helping russian oligarchs avoid sanctions ... etc. ... lol in what world can germans hop on a pedestal about banker justice ? 
  lol and give them reason to start investigating german banks too ? 
   so i think this move is sort of justified protectionist behaviour from the most powerful european country . 
  very fascinating to see a rift between germany and usa . 
  it has been brewing for years . 
  this is about more than trump being an idiot eh . 
  tbf , the european parliament voted to break-up google in a resolution pushed by a [ ** german mep ** ] ( https://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/bits/2014/11/26/european-legislator-urging-the-breakup-of-google-has-ties-to-a-law-firm/ ) who was literally on the payroll of german publishers competing with google . 
  and then you have juncker , former prime minister of tax havenistan , declaring war on tax havens , but only going after american tech companies for publically transparant & openly instituted tax deals made with ireland years ago . 
  so if this is the start of a trade war , meh , at least america is hitting people & corporations that actually deserve it in a justifiable manner for serious crimes , on top of giving them a fair trial through a independent judiciary afterwards . 
  europe on the other hand is just kinda trying to politically hammer , or , if that eu parliament resolution is any measure , outright destroy american tech corporations . 
  tbf , you kinda helped him when you threatened the u.s. senate for trying to increase sanctions on russia over election meddling & the war in ukraine . 
  it 's the little victories that count buddy . 
   keep your chin up . 
  [ ** bernie madoff ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernard_madoff#plea.2c_sentencing.2c_and_prison_life ) in 2009 . 
  the european parliament voted to break-up google after a german mep , [ ** who was literally on the payroll of german publishers , who were competing with google , through his law firm ** ] ( https://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/bits/2014/11/26/european-legislator-urging-the-breakup-of-google-has-ties-to-a-law-firm/ ) , proposed it * ( for all the shit we get about lobbyists from you guys , fucking seriously ? 
  lol ) * . 
  juncker was the prime minister of a country that is basically more tax haven than nation , one that probably has the least transparency & most shady shit going on when it comes to tax bullshit in the eu , but yet despite that intimate & deeply personal knowledge of the issue , he has only ever really targetted american tech companies , the one industry europe is vastly outmatched by america in , over old , publically recorded & loudly announced tax deals with ireland . 
  yeah , but let 's just pray & hope those 5 do n't like to travel much :  according to s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung , germany is not expected to hand over the five suspects to american authorities . 
  however , the international arrest warrant makes it nearly impossible for them to leave the country since most countries abide by interpol warrants . 
  there is a difference between a civil case & a criminal case . 
   you can not sue the same people over and over for the same fact , either the company is responsible and pay or single people are , not both . 
  this is why the company was sued in civil court for knowingly allowing it to happen & these individuals are getting charged in criminal court for being directly responsible for it . 
  ca n't arrest a company . 
  unfortunately they could n't save everybody :  in january , us federal agents [ ** arrested the man in charge of vw 's environmental and engineering office ** ] ( http://m.dw.com/en/vw-executive-pleads-not-guilty-in-us-court-to-dieselgate-charges/a-37697604 ) in michigan , where he served as the company 's top us compliance manager for years . 
   according to prosecutors , the man had conspired to sell around 600,000 vehicles that failed to comply with american emissions standards . 
  he faces up to 25 years in prison for fraud and conspiracy-related charges . 
   the former vw executives stand accused of conspiring to commit fraud and violating us environmental regulations , according to the report . 
  it added that at least two of them were confidants of former vw ceo martin winterkorn . 
   vw has [ ** struggled to put an end ** ] ( http://m.dw.com/en/us-judge-approves-another-vw-dieselgate-settlement/a-38540206 ) to the fallout caused by revelations in 2015 that several of its diesel models included software that deliberately cheated emissions tests . 
  the ensuing scandal led to winterkorn 's resignation . 
   according to s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung , germany is not expected to hand over the five suspects to american authorities . 
  however , the international arrest warrant makes it nearly impossible for them to leave the country since most countries abide by interpol warrants . 
  [ ** okay , let 's do that ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_government_space_agencies#budgets ) * ** nasa : ** $ 19.3 billion __________ * ** esa : ** $ 5.51 billion * ** france : ** $ 2.5 billion * ** germany : ** $ 2 billion * ** italy : ** $ 1.8 billion * ** united kingdom : ** $ 414 million * ** spain : ** $ 135 million * ** the netherlands : ** $ 110 million * ** sweden : ** $ 100 million ** european total : ** $ 12.579 billion so ... how does europe spend more on space than america again ? 
  lol and keep in mind , the european union alone has a much higher population than america with a larger economy to match , so america tops europe on per capita & gdp percentage spending too just by common sense . 
  and do n't even get me started on things like the [ ** $ 8.8 billion usaf space program ** ] ( http://www.spacedaily.com/m/reports/us_military_space_budget_2017_999.html ) that 's not included with nasa 's budget & which probably also does n't cover [ ** the classified shit ** ] ( http://www.space.com/35272-x-37b-military-space-plane-600-days.html ) . 
  ** edit : ** oh , and you ca n't add the per capita spending of two different countries together at face-value & then say the region spends more money per capita than the country you 're comparing them against ... it 's like adding gdp percentages together ... it ... it just does n't work like that or make sense lol ... you need to add both their overall funding & populations together and * then divide * ... 
  philadelphia & up to new england . 
  maryland & d.c. are kinda like a weird north-south bastard child . 
  virginia has become like that too . 
  florida is the southern bastard child you abandoned at a orphanage to be raised by dementia-ridden northerners & spanglish-speaking hispanic islanders . 
  as a american i agree : * ** nasa budget : ** $ 19.3 billion * ** esa budget : ** $ 5.51 billion should n't work with , share tech with or help europeans . 
  ya 'll can raise your own taxes for that shit if you wan na * really * compete with us . 
  [ ** read up ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_agreement_on_german_external_debts ) especially the parts about :  extensive lending , mostly by u.s. investors to german firms and governments . 
  and  another 16 billion marks represented postwar loans by the u.s. ; under the london agreement , the repayable amount was reduced by 50 % to about 15 billion marks and stretched out over 30 years, 
  yes , sure , america economically supported & militarily protected both the eu & it 's predecessor organizationa for generations .
