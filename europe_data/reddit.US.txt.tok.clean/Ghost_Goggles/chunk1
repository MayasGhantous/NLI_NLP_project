thinking that god was the only thing that could save them from that mad world so basically praying for salvation ? 
  that 's hardly fanaticism . 
  i think you mean they were driven to piety or religious devotion as they sought comfort in the midst of a bloody conflict . 
  i could see that argument in the case of some wars ( the crusades ) but how would that work in the case of france in the 30 years ' war ? 
  it 's catholics vs catholics and there was n't any sort of doctrinal dispute between them . 
  i do n't think that can be chalked up to religious fanaticism especially when we 're talking about mercenary armies and this was 100 years after the reformation . 
  the balance of power in europe was shifting and the transition was determined by a bloody conflict . 
  i 'm skeptical that the absence of religion would have prevented it -- seems more likely that catholicism was conflated with hapsburg europe ( austria , spain , southern germany ) , hence france 's alignment, 
   religious fanaticism oh , you mean like catholic france which came out on the side of the protestants because it weakened the hapsburgs and advanced them politically ? 
  or von wallenstein who was primarily responsible for the massive amount of death so he could grab a second crown ? 
  the primary agitators were completely irreligious . 
  you 're missing the point which is that american involvement pushed germany to make a beeline for the caucasus . 
  italy was worthless in north africa and germany badly needed oil to sustain war efforts ( it got so bad that they could n't properly train their pilots due to lack of oil ) , plus they did n't want to fight a two front war against ussr and the usa . 
  so in a sense , yes , ussr pushed back germany on their own but only because hitler 's hand was forced by the usa , and that 's not even considering the economic damage from bombing runs . 
  also / u/sigakoer makes a good point about lend-lease . 
  i doubt the russians would have fared well without it, 
  then what exactly was the point of including 5 million reservists ? 
  does n't really make sense when assessing military capability , `` mate '', 
  your other figure includes a bunch of reservists as well ... it 's like you 're intentionally misrepresenting history to diminish the fact that france was n't militarily prepared for ww2 . 
  even your `` source '' is a commercial website without any academic reference, 
  mobilization is n't instant . 
  these are untrained , ill-equipped soldiers with low morale who would n't have been ready for battle until after the dust settled in poland . 
  plus the french had basically no anti air capability ... france attacking germany in 1939 would have been a joke . 
   i do not understand the 500k number you offered ; wikipedia states 5,000,000 . 
  that figure represents about 5 million reservists that the french conscripted in preparation for german attack in may 1940 ... poland was september 1939 . 
  i think you 're suffering from selective reading comprehension . 
  some more info from the same article regarding the french military :  many divisions were composed of reservists , above 30 years old and ill-equipped . 
  a serious qualitative deficiency was a lack of anti-aircraft artillery , mobile anti-tank artillery and radio communication systems by the end of 1939 the french army was not larger than 900,000 . 
  i 'm struggling to see how they would have successfully invaded germany just because 20-30 % of the wehrmacht was in poland for a few months . 
  so 900,000 invading frenchmen vs 3 million germans with shitloads of air support ( france had shitty aa ) would supposedly succeed because the other million german soldiers are in poland ... iffy source : http://www.schoolshistory.org.uk/europeatwar/frenchreadinessforwar.htm, 
  sorry , how is that a different picture ? 
  that 's an anecdote from one person speculating that france could have successfully attacked germany . 
  france had 500,000 troops total . 
  this is a historical fact . 
  i find it difficult to believe they could overcome double that number of ( better armed ) troops in an offensive against germany with virtually no air support . 
  you may want to reevaluate your argument if you think it 's as simple as french generals being stupid . 
  france only had 500,000 troops in 1939 . 
  how would they have attacked germany which had more than 3,000,000 troops , less than half of which were briefly in poland ? 
  even by the time uk and others sent military support to france , the combined allied air force was outnumbered 2:1 but the luftwaffe and the troop count barely matched the germans . 
  i see why you 're annoyed by jokes about france 's military record , but you 're exhibiting some historical revisionism yourself . 
  off * the table, 
  same thing happened in english , probably because of tv . 
  most of the texan kids talk they 're from california now . 
  the us was ceded guantanamo bay in a treaty 50 years before the revolution . 
  same as africa . 
  nigeria would probably have a cure for cancer by now if you guys had n't colonized it . 
  western europeans * do n't lump us in with those metrosexuals, 
  that 's not a very effective method for weeding out catholics because they can simply violate lenten penance to avoid persecution . 
  it 's a lot different for muslims because pigs are sacred, 
   look i have n't been to church since my confirmation when i was 14 [ the rules changed in 1966 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apostolic_constitution ) , so i take it you are at least 64 years old ? 
   also ok but that 's completely different than what you were saying . 
  based on that body of text it sounds like they were discouraging religion by providing meat during lent , not using it as a sort of litmus test to see who is catholic and keep tabs, 
  catholics do n't have to give up meat for lent , and even if they do , violation of lenten penance is n't a sin . 
  i find your anecdote unlikely . 
  militaries have functions beyond defending against an invasion of the homeland . 
  your country is incapable of dealing with any sort of international conflict . 
  but i presume you would be ok with the us withdrawing from nato since there are no threats to germany ? 
  according to the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_state#military ) your government ca n't make major decisions without russian approval and your military is integrated into the russian military . 
  that does n't sound like a sovereign state to me . 
  it 's an archaic term for belarus in english as well, 
  belarus is part of a union state with russia in which they are not functionally autonomous and their people and language are hardly distinguishable from that of russia . 
  the chances of them joining the eu or cooperating with the eu in any capacity are approximately zero . 
   the collaboration government ended in 1943 , though , when the government refused german pressure to execute captured resistance members . 
  that 's some heavy revisionism . 
  in 1943 germany had suffered a string of major defeats and things turned sour . 
  danish secession had nothing to do with moral considerations or the danish people would not have actively rounded up jews and volunteered to fight for bundeswehr in large numbers . 
  they just saw that the war was lost and wisely backed out . 
  and fyi [ danish public opinion as well as the government favored nazism . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denmark_in_world_war_ii#protectorate_government_1940.e2.80.9343 ), 
  norway collaborated with the nazis to overthrow their government and install a new regime . 
  same with denmark . 
  they supplied a shit ton of * volunteer * troops . 
  they were under political pressure , but you ca n't deny their willingness to aid the fascists . 
  they supplied 800,000 troops to the eastern front . 
  i do n't blame them at all , though . 
  still preferable to soviet occupation and imo ( trigger warning ) the fascists were n't that bad until the ethnic cleansing started . 
  uk 's military is a joke . 
  nato and the us military are virtually indistinguishable, 
  italy , bulgaria , hungary and romania joined them voluntarily . 
  spain , sweden , norway , finland and switzerland were allegedly neutral but supported nazi germany by sending troops and supplies ( norwegian nazis later toppled their government with german help ) . 
  slovakia , croatia , and vichy france also supported them but you could argue that these were puppet states ( especially in the case of vichy ) . 
  so even if most of europe had a bad experience , it was of their own volition . 
  edit : thousands of danish volunteers fought and died for nazi germany as well , but the government was most likely a puppet state, 
  [ median household income in baltimore , maryland is 33k for blacks and 61k for whites ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/29/news/economy/baltimore-economy/ ) so clearly it fits with my `` theory . '', 
  i do n't think you understand the difference between a median and a mean . 
   ` blue ' states at the top of the list and ` red ' states at the bottom how oblivious are you ? 
  red states have more immigration and way more black people ... the southern states are all about 25 % black compared to california which is 7 % or ny at 15 % or better yet oregon at 1 % . 
   surely it 's not the black population who are bringing stats down . 
  dc would have the fifth highest median income well first of all ** that 's bullshit ** . 
  most of the cities in my county have a higher median household income than dc ( more like 90,000 as opposed to 55,000 ) . 
  second , why are you cherrypicking one city when there is data on the whole country ? 
  blacks and hispanics bring the averages wayy down . 
  source : http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/a0104552.html fun fact : 1/3 of the population in dc is functionally illiterate, 
  yeah because uk has so many good teams , wait ... 
  i was trying to make a joke but i think i pulled a jfk on accident, 
  i like salzburgers , how about you ? 
   the term first-generation can refer to either people who were born in one country and relocated to another at a young age , or to their children born in the country they have relocated to . 
  the term second-generation refers to children of ** first-generation immigrants ** nice reading comprehension . 
  you literally had to read one sentence further to realize how wrong you are . 
  a first generation immigrant is someone who was born to immigrants .
