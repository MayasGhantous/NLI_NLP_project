  it is n't something you 're able to substantiate with any historical documents . 
  all we know is that the founding fathers justified secession from britain through divine providence . 
  in washington 's farewell address he emphasized the need for moral principle in governing society . 
   we helped out britain because they were our friend ... which goes completely against your suggestion that we operate strictly out of national interest . 
  you could say we helped them to maintain favorable trade relations but helping them `` because they are our friend '' is a matter of moral principle . 
   there 's the endowed by our creator stuff but there is also a list of very legitimate grievances against the king yes , both those things are present so i 'm not sure by what logic you discount one but not the other . 
  it was definitely a moral argument , and locke 's second treatise on government ( from which the declaration was derived ) also makes a similar moral argument . 
   they were our friend not an alliance . 
   yeah we were helping our friend because it served our interests in your previous comment you said that were forced into war because we were attacked by japan ... 
  i was arguing against that . 
   the declaration of independence has a lot of fluffiness in it but in the end it 's just about our national sovereignty it uses divine providence as justification for independence from britain . 
  that 's the very definition of a moral argument . 
   the problem with the third reich was that they attacked our allie well they did n't , because we did n't have allies . 
  plus france and uk declared war on germany before they were attacked . 
  talk about revisionism ...  were allied with japan who attacked us that 's a bit of an ex post facto justification considering the lend-lease policy and american military belligerence in both the atlantic and pacific  it 's incredibly revisionist to say we entered the war to save gypsies , slavs or jews holy straw man . 
  the us was supplying germany with iron ore and railroads ? 
  the declaration of independence and the preamble to the constitution are mostly `` moralizing and feelings . '', 
  i do n't really understand what you 're suggesting , that countries should be managed in manner void of moral principle ? 
  if that 's the case , what exactly was wrong with nazi germany ? 
  they were protecting their people and expanding the lebensraum after all . 
  i mean , sure , if you base moral decisions strictly on financial outcome they made a good call - boost the swedish steel industry and their capital city was n't destroyed . 
  on the flip side , they contributed to the massacre of millions of slavs , jews and gypsies . 
  take the good with the bad i guess ? 
  is hillary now a pro life , pro traditional marriage , anti-immigration , eurosceptic like fpo , afd , fn and ukip ? 
  or are you just talking out your ass ? 
  the spectrum is n't static throughout space and time . 
  trump ran his campaign on positions of economic nationalism , anti-immigration , pro-gun , and anti social justice . 
  that 's considered hard right . 
  hillary is diametrically opposed to all of those ... what 's really stupid is that some americans ( and even europeans ) claim bernie or other democrats are right wing on the european spectrum . 
  not seeing the resemblance in uk , austria or poland . 
  maybe in sweden or spain it could be an accurate statement . 
  no idea , but ubisoft did n't announce that the game was in active development until mid 2014 and it 's probably a small team . 
  i agree he seems to be taking his sweet ass time though . 
  that cliff hanger was brutal and here we are over a decade later . 
  my point was that sweden neutral in name only , not that they should have officially joined the war . 
  also , november ? 
  ancel reaffirmed he was still working on the game a few months ago . 
  there is definitely going to be a bg&e 2 unless there was another announcement i 'm not aware of . . ? 
  you must live in some kind of alternate universe where the [ family entertainment protection act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/family_entertainment_protection_act ) was n't sponsored by hilary clinton and backed by a bunch of other left wing democrats over a decade ago . 
  and all you had to do was supply 10 million tons of iron ore annually to germany to fuel their war effort and allow them passage through sweden to assist their invasion of the soviet union . 
  millions perish but what matters is that sweden maintains moral high ground through mental gymnastics . 
  you 're arguing with people who do n't understand the concept of human capital . 
  marxism is built on the same false premise -- that a trained professional has no more intrinsic value than a working horse ( figuratively and literally ) and that some people merely possess the means of production through random happenstance . 
  fortunately we can invest in humans through education and training and retain value when menial tasks become unnecessary . 
  the threat of automation is just socialist fearmongering . 
  the nazis also made the same nonsense argument about the dangers of `` english capitalism '', 
  nah , i was just making an observation, 
  i know ... 
  i was pointing out that my statement was n't any more jingoistic than what obama said because neither is jingoistic . 
  nato is weak without the us . 
  this is a well known fact and you 're the one who jumped up my ass for pointing it out, 
  [ he said in an interview that the other nato countries are free riders , incapable of defending against jihadism or russian expansionism . 
  ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/?version=meter+at+1&amp;module=meter-links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentid=&amp;mediaid=&amp;referrer=https%3a%2f%2fwww.google.com%2f&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentcollection=meter-links-click ) also , you 're sense of sarcasm is really non sequitur and lacks the irony to make it funny . 
  i guess obama is aggressively jingoistic too because he said the exact same thing when europe could n't handle a simple bombing campaign in lybia, 
  the eu does n't have the strength to impose jurisdiction on russia . 
  without the us , russia would shit all over the joke known as nato, 
   those that receive the most federal aid tend to be red this came up on / r/politics a couple months ago and it turns out it 's not actually true . 
  the statistic you 're referring to relates state spending and federal aid . 
  red states spend less as a % of gdp due to conservative fiscal policies so they receive `` more '' federal aid relative to state spending . 
  also , although red states are slightly poorer on average , the democrat voters in those states are generally poorer than republican voters so your collective grouping of republicans and democrats by state is exceedingly arbitrary and pointless unless you 're trying to push a narrative that paints conservatives as hypocritical and backwards . 
   out politicians certainly do n't create discriminatory laws like some of your poorest states well the guy bashing america for being `` backwards '' is from cornwall of all places . 
  and the poor and uneducated overwhelmingly vote democrat in the us so you do n't really know what you 're talking about . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_states_and_blue_states#socioeconomics  what are kippers in that context ? 
  ukip supporters, 
  did you read the thread ? 
  / u/millz is n't the one that brought it up ... he was responding to other comments that were jerking themselves off over how enlightened europe is and claiming that unisex bathrooms have never been an issue ... which is obviously not true . 
  he might be reaching a bit with the leftist agenda and naive college students but it sounds about right . 
  it 's not like the kippers are pushing for unisex bathrooms and gender fluid social ideas . 
  were you going to refute anything he said or just go on a butthurt rant ? 
  according to / u/atlas _ at it 's dialectal and completely normal to say that in bavaria and austria . 
  but bavarians and austrians do n't speak german correctly so i guess that 's to be expected ... ^ nur ^ zum ^ spass , 
  i 've never heard `` ich bin ein arzt '' or `` ich bin ein amerikaner '' so i 'm pretty sure you 're either trolling or just being pedantic , unless there 's something weirdly special about argentina, 
  normal people do n't say `` ich bin ein __ '' when referring to nationality or profession, 
  he 's an argentinian living in italy , emotionally fragile , fears right wingers , and ca n't speak german ... this guy must be pope francis, 
  i hope your italian is n't as shitty as your german, 
  do you really have to say '' * bin * nicht sicher '' for it to make sense ? 
  i do n't know how `` the ones '' translates, 
  i was trying to lighten the mood # . 
  \\  boarders \\  prooven \\  intensifly hmmm not sure the fpo politicians are the ones `` lacking education '' here lol, 
  those places are n't functioning though ... 
   the fact that lower stature mothers abort more does not mean that they would give less children for adoption than higher income mothers . 
  it does though ... and black babies with adoptive white parents are so rare that there 's no way you could have a statistically significant sample . 
   it 's a meta-analysis referencing tens of papers from about every corner of recent iq studies whatever you 're trying to say here did n't translate to english quite right . 
   a meta-analysis that would see if there actually is one like [ the bell curve ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_bell_curve ) ? 
  i assumed it was common knowledge . 
   somehow i have the gut feeling that lower income families leave more orphaned kids than higher income families , actually not true . 
  [ low income and non-white parents are more like to abort ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abortion_in_the_united_states#abortions_and_ethnicity ) so the sample of minority children up for adoption is super skewed . 
  that 's a major oversight in your study , and pretty weird that they would disregard it . 
   you ca n't just take a correlation and think that it means causation without eliminating the other variables ... which is exactly what your adoption study does . 
  there 's a very strong correlation suggesting that genetics are the primary factor behind iq and nothing but an oddly specific study showing that some of the disparity disappears in the case of adopted children . 
  if we 're operating under the principle of occam 's razor your conclusion is bunk . 
   and there are plenty of reasons and sources that most adopted kids are from lower-income to upper-income families . 
  sources ... which you wo n't provide for whatever reason . 
  what exactly is your explanation for the huge gap in test scores / iq tests in the us between whites and blacks ? 
  that they 're somehow malnourished and uneducated despite free access to food and education ? 
  keep grasping !, 
  yeah it 's definitely grasping at straws , because you 're citing a left wing radical , in a study which exclusively uses adopted children as `` evidence '' that genes play no role in iq . 
  what exactly precludes the possibility that couples prefer to adopt children from middle/upper class families ? 
  that would create a massive bias which flynn does n't even address , and in all likelihood is the probable reason . 
  more intelligent people tend to earn more .
