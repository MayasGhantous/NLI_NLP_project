  germany invaded western half of poland . 
  uk and france declared war on germany . 
  ussr invaded eastern poland . 
  no war declared . 
  uk did n't think they could fight russia and germany , and after germany shat on france it turned out they were right . 
  so instead of germany taking over europe and senselessly murdering millions , ussr took over and senselessly murdered millions . 
  such a noble war . 
   do poles have a problem with the vietnamese and just do n't admit it on reddit or not ? 
  reddit is n't even remotely representative of reality . 
  pis won 38 % of the popular vote and like two polish redditors admitted voting for them while the rest blasted them for being reactionaries . 
  69 % of poles view abortion as immoral and unacceptable , yet again only handful seem to share this view in / r/europe threads like [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3x3c5m/abortion_in_poland_and_nearby/ ) . 
   when the ussr attacked poland was already lost [ no it was n't . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/wrzesien2.jpg ) uk was just looking for an excuse to attack germany, 
  [ the agreement contained promises of mutual military assistance between uk and poland in the event either was attacked by any european country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-polish_military_alliance#polish-british_common_defense_pact ) . 
  it did not say germany specifically . 
  i suggest you research these things before spreading misinformation . 
   probably is n't bothering to interact with them i interact with them every week at del taco, 
  you were obligated to defend poland from the ussr in 1939 . 
  that did n't happen . 
  umm no . 
  i was referring to the higher crime rates and low literacy in hispanic communities . 
  [ hispanics account for 3x their share of crime in the us . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/race_and_crime_in_the_united_states#hispanics ) even if you discount immigration offenses it 's double the rate of whites . 
  [ 40 % of hispanics lack basic english skills . 
  ] ( http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/hispanic-literacy-in-u-s-shows-troubling-signs-1927954.php ) and here you are calling people `` scared of strangers '' for thinking this is an issue . 
   do you see how this works ? 
  pretty much . 
  i make a point based on statistical correlation and you counter it with a random anecdote . 
  ever been to east la ? 
   it 's just a community yeah `` just a community '' with high illiteracy and crime . 
  you 're missing the point , which is that you suggested in your original comment that i 'm xenophobic if i do n't like the fact that there are entire neighborhoods in the us that do n't speak english, 
  do you live in a majority hispanic community ? 
  i do . 
  it 's not as fun as you seem to think it is . 
  the hypothetical existence of long-term male contraception does n't change the validity of my argument . 
  there 's a double standard when it comes to reproductive rights and the feminists do n't seem to be bothered by it . 
  what if i get drugged and raped ? 
  still zero reproductive rights and 18 years of child support payments through no fault of my own . 
  or if i offer to take care of the child myself she can completely ignore my wishes and terminate pregnancy . 
  no , but we can offer an abortion which a woman can refuse and in turn milk us for child support . 
  that does n't seem very egalitarian that the woman gets to make a unilateral decision regarding the ( prospective ? ), 
  child, 
  do you find it outrageous that in europe reproductive rights only apply to women ? 
  there 's no concrete evidence that this actually happened or that brits were n't doing the same thing in their colonies where slavery was still legal . 
  you act like we were the only slavers but netherlands did n't abolish until 1863 , pretty much the same time as us . 
  the us abolished the slave trade in 1807 , same year as uk . 
   there is no self-defense we declared independence and they invaded . 
  that 's what self defense is . 
  the british gave up de facto control when they refused to assent to laws or even defend the colonies from indian attacks . 
  the first military engagements were the battles of lexington and concord in 1775 after the british deployed troops on our soil . 
  i do n't consider that violence in the equivocal sense that / u/nyxisto used the word by conflating violent resistance and systematic extermination of dissident groups . 
  i do n't really see how you can paint a moral equivalence between the founding fathers of the us and the man who created the gulag and massacred thousands of people just to instill fear . 
  the british and portuguese enslaved them . 
  do n't try to pin that shit on us . 
   yeah that usually happens when you unilaterally secede from a sovereign nation i do n't see what that has to do with anything or how the frequency of an action morally justifies it . 
  you compared our revolution to the bolsheviks but we did n't attempt to overthrow the british crown , nor did we mass execute ethnic minorities and clergy . 
  also our government was/is democratic and not a communist single party state . 
  pretty striking differences . 
  the british invaded of their own volition . 
  no one forced them to do so . 
  lenin , on the other hand , was a bloodthirsty psychopath like all bolsheviks . 
  it 's literally written in the manifesto, 
  you 're conflating chickens and humans . 
  if op ate human eggs you would have a point . 
   then sex with contraception or masturbating is committing genocide only if you jizz out embryos, 
   liberation for huge parts of the population yeah , liberation from their mortal coils if you 're a cossack or a priest  after all the creation of the united states was violent as well . 
  we declared independence and the british attacked us . 
  we only acted in self defense . 
  you can actually buy/eat fertilized eggs ( and they 're delicious ) , but his point is retarded anyway because eggs in the supermarket come from chickens , not humans . 
  lenin cared about human rights so much that he mass murdered orthodox clergymen and cossacks , and invaded poland unprovoked in 1921 to . . err ... liberate them from from their oppressive democratic government, 
  no it 's not . 
  unless you 're referring to the federal constitution which makes your word choice very odd, 
  your comment does n't contradict mine so i 'm really confused as to what you 're trying to say ... 
  taking japanese prisoners was n't a good idea anyway . 
  they would sometimes `` surrender '' and use it as a cheap opportunity to ambush the enemy or murder/suicide them with a grenade . 
  fuck that . 
  the atomic bombs were probably morally wrong but definitely understandable . 
   what country controlled california before mexico ? 
  what 's your point ? 
  op said our culture is a blend between american and * mexican * not american and spanish . 
  not sure what the grant quote has to do with anything . 
  mexico had no legitimate claim to california, 
  california was part of mexico for 27 years . 
  there were never hardly any mexicans in california prior to the late 20th century when the dems opened the border and offered free shit, 
  you 're claiming that the southwest has been a blend of hispanic culture for centuries when the area was like 2 % hispanic until 50 years ago . 
  seems like revisionist viva la mexico reconquista nonsense to me . 
  [ in 1970 san diego was 10 % latino . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_diego#demographics ) i 'm going to go out on a limb and say you 've never been here and have no clue what you 're talking about . 
  it did n't start turning into mexico until the democrats realized there were millions of potential voters ( uneducated just the way leftists like ) just south of the border, 
   what country or nation on earth was not at some point conquered * thailand * nepal * saudi arabia also the japanese ( until wwii ) but that did n't stop them from acting like homicidal lunatics, 
  i think you 're missing the broader point here , which is that europe and spain specifically have been involved in plenty of bloodshed over the last hundred years . 
  so it 's pretty stupid to accuse america of being blood thirsty when we have n't provoked much armed conflict . 
   plus franco 's government was very divided between pro-american and pro-german moot point . 
  your government provided soldiers and support to the nazis . 
  if we 're assigning blame for bloodshed , that one 's on spain . 
   the civil war was an internal problem ... so ? 
  it was still bloody as hell . 
  and i would n't call the republican defeat a `` problem . '', 
  in fact , i find that statement terrifying . 
   it 's not us who got involved in the two world wars spain supported nazi germany ( even though they claimed neutrality ) , and blaming the us for wwii and wwi is ridiculous .
