   compared to ... continental or northern european countries where people are happy and well off you would not have the same quality of life if you were n't so well integrated into the global system that is supported by the us and other powerful western countries . 
  and yea , you 're little tiny countries are lucky to have their social welfare system . 
  small populations allow you to have nimble bureaucracies that can efficiently serve everyone . 
  hard to do that with 320 million people . 
  oh , you 're saying that being assertive and proactive to hostile regimes is fascist ? 
  where would we be now if peacekeeping troops had been sent to ukraine 3 months ago ? 
  or what if the eu decided one up putin 's loan offer to yanukovych instead of ruling out a `` bidding war '' ? 
  or what if the eu abandoned their demands to free tymoshenko to guarantee that yanukovych would sign the partnership agreement which would have avoided provoking euromaidan ? 
  no , europe did n't want to be assertive when the crisis was small , it wants to wait until it becomes a fucking bloodbath before it acts . 
  okay , you 're totally right we should wait until everything gets so severe that we 're sucked into war . 
  nope , we should not stand up to backwards ass autocrats who do n't honor diplomatic agreements , we should let them do whatever they want until it blows up in our face . 
  edit : oh , and news flash : everyone will always hate us because their politicians use the us as a scapegoat for just about everything . 
  we could fucking save the world from aliens or some shit and ten years later they would go back to hating us . 
  ... and eu soldiers should start pouring in, 
  madrid making that up to scare you , nato does n't do that . 
  unless newly independent catalonia attacks spain , then it 's fucked . 
  no , when algeria fought for independence from france , nato refused to intervene . 
  then maybe it 's time for us to crackdown on this bullshit . 
  i do n't mean to be racist , but the western european/north american dream for the world is vastly superior and advanced than any other potential model . 
  period . 
  if europeans and americans wanted to , we could firmly reinforce the liberal ( us-english definition ) world order . 
  we have the power to do so . 
  edit : sorry for thinking that we should aggressively counter those who want to thrust us back into the way the world used to work, 
  idk if you 're british or not , but the guardian is a british publication ( with a large presence in the us and australia ) . 
  in the english speaking world , we have a very large number of people of african descent that have been a part of our society * for hundreds of years * ( as opposed to just a recent surge in immigration ) the guardian cares about this kind of stuff because it 's really important for societal cohesion for us to be ever vigilant against racism . 
  sometimes it goes to far , but there is a lot of shitty racism that still slips through the cracks . 
  ( for example , in the us if a black man commits the same crime as a white man , the black man is more likely to be found guilty and will get a harsher sentence . ), 
  artsy shit like this is good , i like it . 
  it reminds people of racism without being unnecessarily vicious . 
   in belgium , some of the 267 congolese being exhibited died during the show and were unceremoniously buried in an anonymous common grave . 
  speechless . 
  you know the ukrainian gov is way to the left of the russian gov , right ? 
  because nobodies knows anything about azerbaijan also azerbaijan is probably shitty because of russia . 
  so what english just turns into a bunch of related languages that are widely spoken ? 
  like latin did with spanish french italian romanian portuguese and bunch of other little random regional languages . 
  oh saint helen , as in `` mount saint helen '', 
  if you count proxy wars , the number between england and france shoots through the roof ( thanks to their centuries long , epic struggle for global imperial dominance ), 
  i do n't want to be russophobic , but i 'm not surprised that moscow might be behind this . 
  ** if ** those pictures of people being shot and strangled are genuine , then it 's true that is was n't a freak accident committed by pro-unity ukrainians but an orchestrated strike by forces loyal to moscow . 
  sweden vs denmark is like england vs france ? 
  what if your name is ellen or hellen ? 
  fantastic work !, 
  thanks you so much !, 
  it 's like admitting that it should n't belong to * moscow * but to k\u00f6nigsbergers ( the people that live there ), 
  guantanamo , drones , nsa = the trifecta anti american argument, 
  what the fuck man , this is like coming out against nazi bashing . 
  the biggest news in europe is the ukraine crisis . 
  took like 2,000 years though, 
  why do n't you downvote the posts you do n't like , and let the majority decide what should be on / r/europe 's front page . 
  i do n't think those are western values i think those are fucking perversions of western values . 
  actions by western governments = / = western values, 
  he 's fucking ukrainian , do you really expect him to post about anything other than what 's happening to his country ? 
  young russians in kaliningrad call them selves k\u00f6nigsbergers . 
  * something something it 's all america 's fault something something *, 
  not the most recent one in 2014 , but the one before in 2009, 
  no i would n't because in russia , professors get fired if their opinions run counter to the kremlin narrative . 
  like the the guy at moscow state university who got sacked because he spoke out against the crimea annexation . 
  meanwhile at american universities you have ** numerous ** professors who are ** the harshest ** critics of american policy ( * cough cough * mit 's noam chomsky ), 
   ** located at stanford university in california ** this is like the pinnacle of credibility . 
  what the fuck are doing calling the hoover institution right-wing and sensationalist ?!, 
  do you even know what the hoover institution is ?? 
  it 's comfortably center-right . 
  you 're quite the sassy bitch , are n't you ? 
  i get your jab against alarmism , but remember that in the years immediately following 9/11 terrorism actually was a pretty serious threat to the west ... 
  i mean world trade center , the pentagon , the london tube , the trains in spain , fort hood ... not to mention the numerous terrorist attacks in the middle east , the attempted terrorist attacks ( shoe bomber , that one guy who set his pants on fire ) and it 's still causing chaos in africa . 
  my point is that putins russia is currently a threat and it is not alarmist to say so . 
  if people are still screaming about putins russia in 13 years , then i 'll consider your suggestion of alarmism . 
  ( unless of course putins russia keeps annexing territory left and right , then it will be an even bigger threat in 13 years ), 
  everyone 's a beneficiary ( except russia ) . 
  holy fuck , japan 's unemployment rate is at 1.5 % wow and how ? 
  the ukraine situation is kind of a big deal though and it 's a really really * really * relevant crisis to europe . 
  i knew we had natural gas , but damn i did n't know it was * that * much natural gas . 
  no , because lithuania is run by decent people who would n't want to impose even more burdens upon k\u00f6nigsbergers . 
  umm idk spiegal , maybe it 's because theirs a major crisis in ukraine right now ? 
  hmm ... europeans = arrogant internet people = know-it-alls internet europeans = arrogant know-it-alls ... 
  well that guy was planting a soviet flag so if he was still alive and was in ukraine , he 'd be one of those pro-russia goons, 
  to be fair the title does n't say he died . 
  and honestly , if he had n't have died it would be pretty satisfying because karma . 
  edit : oh shit , i watched the video and it 's horrifying . 
  i think / r/clearlymoreeducatedandinformedthanthegeneralpopulation is better or maybe / r/canseethroughpropagandaandactuallyunderstandwhatshappeningandareconcerned, 
  no , because gypsies have really good music and cute children ( even if they are a bit too ... `` enthusiastic '' ), 
   consul that would be fucking badass, 
  austerity was not for the financial elite it was a german policy meant to introduce fiscal responsibility to certain eu governments . 
  for example , greece had exorbitant benefits but greeks were n't fully taxes to pay for those benefits . 
  like it or not that was very fiscally irresponsible . 
  instead of tax , they borrowed and borrowed . 
  when the financial crisis hit , it hit the fiscally irresponsible the hardest . 
  nevertheless , it will be good when austerity fully ends , which should be quite soon . 
  edit : oh , and ukraine under yanukovych was wildly fiscally irresponsible . 
  billions of dollars of taxpayer money was spent in building palaces for the elite . 
  if you work in the private sector , you 're guaranteed christmas and thanksgiving off . 
  but your boss will bribe you with overtime pay if you work on christmas and thanksgiving . 
  probably some gorgeous woman with the voice of a proud black woman . 
   i checked ( usa/canada ) if you 're willing to either be a really devout kyiv patriarchate orthodox or even better convert to greek catholicism and get in contact with some of those church communities in north america ; they will help you get immigration shit together . 
  i know that sounds silly , but seriously , you want to immigrate from ukraine to north america you get in contact with faith communities of ukrainian extraction . 
  and convince them that you 're devout . 
  edit : that 's how my grandpa did it , and that 's how he and his church helped some greek catholic ukrainians move here with their families . 
   in a monarchical system , the country automatically becomes hostage to the psychosomatic quirks of its leader . 
  all of his fears , passions , weaknesses , and complexes become state policy . 
  if he is paranoid , the whole country must fear enemies and spies ; if he has insomnia , all the ministries must work at night ; if he 's a teetotaler , everyone must stop drinking ; if he 's a drunk -- everyone should booze it up ; if he does n't like america , which his beloved kgb fought against , the whole population must dislike the united states .
