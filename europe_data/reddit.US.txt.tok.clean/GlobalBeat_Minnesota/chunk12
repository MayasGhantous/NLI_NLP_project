  a country such as this can not have a predictable , stable future ; gradual development is extraordinarily difficult . 
  ai n't that the truth . 
  it 's time to reform . 
  it 's never time to break up . 
  friends dad makes 120k a year as a cop in minneapolis , that 's with 15 hours of over time though ( 55 hours per week ) . 
  american police in medium-sized cities and big cities make a * shit ton * of money when they work overtime . 
  i 'm glad he 's the front runner , i know he 's the choco-king , but that kinda makes me think he 'll be more resistant to corruption . 
  also he know how to deal with thugs . 
  do n't know why you got down voted because what you was true . 
  it 's just a very colorful way of saying it . 
  yea but honoring napoleon is like honoring caesar . 
  honoring stalin is like honoring hitler . 
  oh that is a bunch of shite , so many peasants and workers were starved , slaughtered and sent to siberia by the soviet government that it completely invalidates their claim to true socialism . 
  also the fact that soviet leaders lived in luxury while the masses could n't even find shoes that fit right . 
  greece is not culturally balkan, 
  is n't thrace part of historical greece though ? 
  well okay , but i feel bad little fyrom ... 
  it 's just an itty bitty teensy tiny country , like a little drop on the map . 
  i mean , is it really that big of a deal if that little speck calls itself macedonia ? 
  oh man , that would be putins dream . 
  hard to be economically destroyed when you 've conquered the wealthiest continent on earth . 
  okay , then do n't ban any imports from the states that have constitutional bans on the death penalty ( there are many ), 
  says the guy whose name is `` all gypsies must die '', 
  greece is a mediterranean country ; like italy , spain , malta , cyprus , southern france and for some reason lebanon ( but no other muslim countries ), 
  * serbs are really `` intense '' as a collective . 
  they used to be really into ethnic cleansing , but now it looks like they are slated to join the eu which is sort of the opposite of ethnic cleansing ( ethnic blending ? ), 
  * serbian and croatian ( or is it serbian and slovenian or slovenian and croatian ) are the ** same ** language !, 
  they refuse to admit this and one uses the cyrillic alphabet and the other uses the latin alphabet . 
  * croatia has the dalmatian coast so i 'm going to assume that the croats are the ones who gave us dalmatians ( the dog ) . 
  * macedonia is maybe not really macedonia , according to the greeks . 
  type ` putin ' into the search engine and you 'll see that there are no articles criticizing putin and dozens , if not hundreds , or articles criticizing germany , the eu and the us . 
  how come italians get to be loud and we do n't ? 
  double standard !, 
  ( although i admit , italians are entertaining to overhear and watch , even if you do n't understand the words ), 
  western leader lie too , it 's just ** no where near ** the same level as what the russian leaders are saying . 
  oh my , world socialist website is not really a proper socialist website . 
  very pro-putin , which is * very * anti-socialist edit : if anything , the kyiv government will steer ukraine closer to socialism since it 's steering ukraine towards europe and it 's social democratic values . 
  well it 's moscows own fucking fault if that happens . 
  yea , i 'm pretty sure our war of independence was a proxy war of a much larger , global conflict, 
  oh yea , because this will lead to nuclear war . 
  we endured an entire cold war , but this is what 's gon na do it . 
  russia would be destroyed too . 
  yea , didnt the dutch provide guns and poland provide mercenaries spain did something too . 
  i do n't remember what that was though . 
  yea , i 'm a solid obama supporter and democrat . 
  hilary clinton is a goddess , athena incarnate . 
  i was counter-trolling . 
  well there we have it , if you try to join odessa to novorossiya , you 'll burn, 
  oh whatevs , ukraine proves that nato is needed . 
  if be down for belarus , ukraine , moldova , georgia and ... depending on whether or not russia invades e. ukraine , even kazakhstan to join nato . 
  i mean it 's not an attack organization , it just allows countries to keep their own borders . 
  woah there , one wack job is all it takes to burn down a building . 
  do n't blame the entire movement edit : okay it was like 5 guys, 
  left wingers in that part of the world are all corrupt as fuck . 
  well maybe if you had done the smart thing and align with the west over russia , we would n't have funded terrorists against you . 
  dude , wtf are you talking about . . 
  even the us would not have gained independence if the french had n't intervened with boots on the ground, 
  well , maybe if you would n't have genocided a bunch of people , nato would n't have intervened . 
  okay guy , thanks for omitting several relevant facts to make your point seem plausible . 
  i love it when people do that . 
  then why did [ gong farmers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gong_farmer ) exist ? 
  and fewer wolves , eagles , and coyotes to eat those outdoors cats, 
  i have a feeling that there might be more cats per km ^ 2 in europe than there are in america ... 
  if you 're a little kitty cat , yeah . 
  it 's depressing that as soon as american society started to become really anti-war , we are needed to be more assertive . 
  i 'm staunchly anti-war , but it has become clear to me that we must go to war if our allies need it . 
  is n't shitting in other peoples gardens something people would like ? 
  shit is good for plants . 
  now that they 've started kidnapping , they are terrorists . 
  they are desperately trying to avoid that war , even though the enemy has * already * invaded, 
  you would n't say that if you 'd have followed maidan from the beginning . 
  it was a beautiful display of humanity , no journalists or international observers were kidnapped or tortured at any time . 
  canada 's actually being super aggressive about this . 
  my theory is that : 1 . 
  they have a shit ton of ukrainians in canada , and harper really wants their votes 2 . 
  they are showing russia that they can be aggressive which sends a message that russia wo n't be able to push them around in the arctic . 
  yea , but did you guys walk around holding pictures of mass murderers ? 
  they have no idea who those men actually were . 
  and you forgot the 10 million + ukrainians . 
  there was a global financial collapse in 2008 , once europe emerges from the crisis once and for all , bulgaria will feel the effects . 
  they have no choice, 
  yea were similar but the british would rather die than admit it . 
  just replace us with canada and they would agree ... 
  even though american and canadians are very similar , at least * northern * americans and canadians are similar . 
  btw , which part of the us are you in ? 
  woah , uk coming in at a whopping 28 % of gni followed by sweden at 6 %, 
  no it 's used , it 's just politically incorrect . 
  it 's part of the wasp acronym : white anglo saxon protestant, 
  ** 2019 ** did you not read that ? 
   any single member had an absolute veto, 
  no it wo n't , it will be another one of those small countries that makes all it 's money in banking . 
  furthermore it will be totally economically dependent on england, 
  yea , its really the first and fifth points that really make the difference . 
  my state you need a background check and have to take a class . 
  if you drive to wisconsin , a 30 minute drive from where i am right now , you can buy a gun no questions asked . 
  that 's how it works . 
  hard to match the us growth rates when you do n't have * supreme authority making decision that has ultimate authority over states * less than 1 % of people in the most independent craving state , texas , actually desire independence . 
  * same language and certain cultural standards ( i.e. 
  vermont pensioners can be sure that property bought in arizona is theirs ' whereas a british pensioner might be * legally * swindled after ` buying ' and apartment in bucharest ) * big , highly developed coasts on the both the atlantic and pacific * energy is extracted from home territory or from canada ( which is a lot more reliable and easier to work with than russia ) * mafia clans dating back to the middle ages ( southern italy and spain ) * the vast tracks of farmland of the american mid-west , the fertility of which is rivaled only by the chernozem of ukraine . 
  i 'm sure there are other things .
