  good news is that the biggest differences can be bridged if europeans want it . 
  also do n't need to be in nato , because you 're surrounded by a sea of friends . 
  well it 's a celtic name so that makes it okay right ? 
  rome is in italy , venice is in italy , the renaissance was born in italy . 
  they 're western, 
  no , it 's just that it only recently became diplomatically correct to say it in public . 
  what ? 
  he 's a bleeding heart progressive . 
  he ran for president in 2004 against bush and his entire campaign was : `` elect me and i will end the iraq war '', 
  hey good news about europe !, 
  especially since this author is usually pessimistic as fuck, 
  i think more people will need to become entrepreneurs and artists . 
  with the help of robots and a 3d printer , one creative person could create amazing things in their own basement . 
  combine this with crowd-sourced funds and imagine what a group of creative , innovative people could make, 
  kind of confused as to how italy and iberia is not western europe ... latin europe ( except romania ) is undeniably western in terms of values . 
  oh fucking really ?!, 
  i 'm so surprised that ukrainians are being anti-moscow and russophobic !, 
  i 'm mean , it 's not like russia invaded and annexed a part of their territory and now has 60,000 troops amassed on its borders , prepared to overrun the country in 3-5 days ... 
  i hate to say it but , if you make a european equivalent , gchq will just take the data and share it with the us gov. 
  and if you make a european equivalent that excludes the uk , dgse will just take the data and share it with the us gov. 
  do n't forget about the 9-eyes club . 
  yea , it 's nice to have genetic diversity ; keeps the masses strong . 
  helps us avoid the problems that you inbred hapsburg shits have . 
  what , the oily water ? 
  that oily water is injected into the cavities that * used to be filled with just oil *, 
  haha kegel is a type of exercise middle aged women do to strengthen their vagina muscles, 
  i follow toomas ilves and he spits fire in face of the russian bear . 
  cool to know the old president did that too . 
   very rich wasteland [ thats a gross exaggeration of the environmental damage ] ( http://i.imgur.com/masrapx.jpg ), 
  romania , do n't do this to yourself . 
  stockholm and albania ? 
  yugoslavia is a now extinct nationality . 
  its kind of like saying your ethnicity is soviet . 
  more accurate to say you 're slavic , mostly croatian and slovenian . 
  as was the backlash to the backlash . 
  euros will give you sass for this comment , but it legitimately was one of europe 's greatest contributions to the world . 
  religion has no place in the school curriculum for children , that 's for sure . 
  but religion can for sure have a place in the curriculum of a institution of higher education . 
  i 'm personally atheist , but there 's nothing wrong with private , religiously affiliated schools . 
  edit : especially when the religious message of those schools is inclusive and tolerant , for example gustavus is a strong supporter of lgbt rights, 
  this dispute is kind of funny considering that the ancient greeks resisted accepting ancient macedonians as greek until philip conquered them . 
  and even then , they only recognized the macedonian aristocracy as greek and staunchly refused to recognize macedonian commoners ( 90 % of the population ) as greek . 
  you 're saying that a christian affiliation is not compatible with swedish culture ? 
  how about being a monarchy , does n't that conflict with modern swedish culture ? 
  does that mean the swedish crown is n't swedish ?? 
  ... and you do know that theres a cross on sweden 's flag , right ? 
  i 'm just going to go ahead and say that you do n't really know what you 're talking about . 
  being swedish does not make you an expert on `` swedishness '', 
  because you 're implying that gustavus is backwards for upholding the lutheran tradition it was founded on . 
  edit : so are you saying that anything that does n't perfectly reflect modern swedish culture is n't swedish ? 
  like , a swedish battleship from 1600 is n't swedish ? 
  or a church in stockholm is n't swedish ? 
  were your great-grandparents not swedish because they were religious ? 
  oh shit , you know nothing about gustavus ... 
  it 's a major science and engineering school . 
  and it 's super left wing . 
  spot on . 
  this made me think of this coke commercial , were they sing an [ american folk song in many different languages ] ( http://youtu.be/443vy3i0gjs ) it 's ** very important for social cohesion ** that americans recognize and embrace our ethnic differences . 
  for example , when a vietnamese immigrant realizes that she can be both vietnamese and american and that she can pass her vietnamese identity to her american born children , ** she will be more likely to embrace her american identity and strive to integrate ** edit : i shed a few man tears watching that video, 
  this comment actually offended me . 
  you do know that sweden was once a very strict lutheran country , do n't you ? 
  are you saying that the entire history of sweden does n't matter to modern swedes ? 
   yugoslavian made me cringe . 
  if you 're grandfather was native american , that would make you native american . 
  is there really a gypsy season ? 
  like , do they start moving around once it gets warm out ? 
  edit : i realize it sounds like i 'm implying they 're like animals , but they 're nomads and i was thinking they hunkered down somewhere for the winter and then resumed nomadism in the spring . 
  the plains indians used to do this , so i thought roma did too . 
  my bad, 
  you believe the ottomans brought the gypsies to europe ? 
  it makes me really sad , i love the union jack and do n't want to see it go . 
  it is a humanitarian one . 
  do it . 
  it 'll definitely get that transnistria problem taken care of , once those separatists get an eu passport , they wo n't want to give it up . 
  it might be a cultural thing , ukrainians maybe have a different concept of what a terrorist is, 
  euromaidan : 300,000 ukrainians of all walks of life peacefully protested for ** three months ** without a single incident before being provoked into violence by draconian laws that curbed their civil rights . 
  rt and other russian propaganda given free access . 
  eastern ukraine affair : balaclavas and ak-47 's on day 1 . 
  19 journalists detained . 
  what , moscow !? 
  really ? 
  texas does actually have a foreign policy of sorts , as do most states with big economies . 
  it 's just that it is submissive to us foreign policy and is mainly about securing business deals abroad and dealing with immigration snafus . 
  for example , a swiss mining juggernaut wanted to start working on extracting a massive copper-nickel-platinum deposit in my state and they worked with ** state ** authorities to get the go ahead to set up business . 
  unless it 's ww3 , the federal gov has no business interfering in our economic deals . 
  but we can assure that these economic deals are fair to us because we negotiate with the geopolitical weight of the united states balancing the scale ( very useful in a minnesota-china economic deal ) europe should try a model of this . 
  the eu does n't follow anyone 's direction ... not even the eu . 
  the perception that the eu is the america 's dog is because europeans refuse to have a common defense and foreign policy . 
  also , american and european geopolitical and economic interests are closely aligned ( in the case of britain , perfectly aligned ) . 
  oh shit , i did n't know about that that was probably an ethnic thing though , bostonians of irish extraction are tigerishly proud of their celtic roots . 
  well , people on the left and right are making a fuss about here too , so maybe ourside will be forced to oppose isds ... 
  but that opposition might be until elections this fall are over . 
   i would , quite frankly , support state terrorism on us soil . 
  well , you 're just an knavish old goat , are n't you ? 
  a knavish goat with utters full of sour milk . 
  or if there is no pollution , but an inspector from the government says you wo n't get the okay unless you pay up, 
  well , if a culture that committed atrocities accept what they 've done , and teaches their young about the horrors of such atrocities ; they are less likely to repeat them . 
  look at germany , who teach their young about their atrocities , they certainly wo n't commit another holocaust any time in the next few centuries . 
  then look at russia and ukraine , millions of ukrainian peasants starved so moscow , leningrad and stalingrad could eat . 
  moscow refuses to accept this and do n't teach their schoolchildren about its horrors .
