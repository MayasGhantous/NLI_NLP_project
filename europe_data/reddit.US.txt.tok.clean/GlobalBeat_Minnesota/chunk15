  they just decided that it would be better pr to not make these terms public . 
  the govt has already made huge budget cuts and has implemented anti corruption reforms . 
  the imf would not be giving these loans if it did not trust ukraine to pay back these loans, 
  obama is a fucking amazing president , he is only a disappointment because of shithead tea party republicans in the house . 
  they are ruining everything and are truly evil . 
  he has two years left , just wait and see . 
  russia 's carrots was offering carrots while at the same time undermining the ability of the ukrainian state to remain independent . 
  do n't equate the eu 's carrots with russia 's carrots . 
  the difference in transparency should give you an impression of how different the offers were . 
  the carrots are the association agreement which would open up the massive european economy to ukraine and would also establish a business environment in ukraine that is friendly to foreign investment . 
  those were carrots for the oligarchs not for the people who wanted to see a modernized ukraine . 
   but historical precedence is in my opinion miles away from trying to predict what will happen . 
  true , it wo n't predict exactly whats happening but quite clearly we are seeing that russia is acting in the same way it has for the better part of the past 500 years . 
  * an authoritarian government reasserted itself * bullying neighbors to force them into unequal political associations * annexed the territory of a sovereign country * has troops on the ground in a sovereign country in an attempt to destabilize that country ( ukraine , georgia and moldova ) * has been conducting highly aggressive military exercises near the borders of neighboring countries ( finland , estonia , and a sailed naval ships into lithuanian territorial waters and forced lithuanian merchant vessels to move . ), 
  * has announced they will build military installations on the kuril islands , a disputed territory between russia and japan ( and have been scrambling jets to fly into japanese airspace to incite a response from the japanese ) * has stoked imperialist sentiment in its population with rhetoric like novorossiya , ukraine is not a real country , protection of ethnic kin , holy orthodox russia and the overall glorification of russian imperial history with a complete disregard for the atrocities of that era . 
   you are trying to argue that people in europe are generally anti-russia in this case because the actions of russia do not fit into some common set of values that europeans all developed in the 1700s yea , thats exactly what i 'm arguing  and what about , you know , that awkward 200 year period of brutal european colonialism , racism , apartheid , and anti-semitism that directly followed the europe 's enlightenment i think that those 200 years are what drove european society to accept the enlightenment values as core societal values . 
  the ideals of the european enlightenment didnt immediately spring into mainstream european society ; it took time for them to soak in . 
  even the united states ( whose state and political foundations were created by men who were avid admirers of the philosophers of the european enlightenment ) had slavery and restricted the vote to white men . 
  but these ideas held on in western europe , even while emperors rose in france and kaisers rose in germany . 
  those ideals were added upon , streamlined and made applicable to daily political life . 
  germans after wwii looked back at the holocaust with horror through their enlightened lens that said that all people are equal . 
  same with americans after they heard the words of dr. king and saw the struggles of southern blacks . 
  also the british after they saw the determination of gandhi in india . 
  the ** ideals ** of the european enlightenment are just that : ** ideals ** i.e. 
  something that can never be fully achieved because achieving them would mean achieving perfection , which is impossible . 
  you do n't know how things will be in 30 years . 
  look at europe 30 years ago and you 'll see how things can change . 
  historical precedence, 
  interesting though , i think the ukraine conversation highlights so much of what is happening in europe . 
  * european attitudes towards far right-wing groups * eu foreign and defense policy * east-west divisions in european society * economic situation in europe ( hesitant to impose sanctions , endanger recovery ) * tension between germany and the rest of europe with regards to germany 's leading role in europe * strengths of the european union ( charismatic draw ) * europe 's role in the world . 
  and there 's so much more that i have n't put into words yet . 
  as an american , i 'm really learning a lot about europe through the ukraine conversation on this sub edit : americas role in europe . 
  how europeans see american influence in terms if defense . 
  if russia thinks it 's strong enough , it will push into nato territory . 
  if russia is strong enough , it will push into poland . 
  might not annex territory , but it would force it into the eurasian union . 
  i do n't think it 's geographic , i think it 's the acceptance of certain values . 
  my opinion of the situation is heavily influenced by the imperialist past of my country , and the countries that imperialized the land i now live on ( france , britain and spain ) . 
  what russia is doing to ukraine is the same damn thing that those imperial powers of the past did , and i do n't want to see a return to that world . 
  ukraine is a sovereign state , and the eu used * carrots * to attract the ukrainian people into the western fold . 
  this is legitimate because the eu proposed a deal that would benefit both parties . 
  this is business and diplomacy . 
  russia is using * sticks * to pressure ukraine back into an unequal relationship that benefits russia and the ukrainian oligarchs . 
  this is imperialism . 
  firstly , you have to recognize that many european states subscribe to the western system of values ( which were born in europe during the european enlightenment ) . 
  now analyze this through enlightenment values : * russia invaded a european country and annexed a portion of its territory . 
  russia is actively trying to destabilize ukraine ahead of its upcoming presidential election in an attempt to further its own geopolitical interests . 
  * it 's not because if astroturfers or shills , it 's because the values of the european enlightenment find russia 's actions in ukraine abhorrent . 
  obama thought medvedev was the real deal i.e. 
  he thought medvedev had been fairly elected and was the top power in moscow , only to find out that putin was actually in charge and this made him intensely dislike putin . 
  hopefully not . 
  manning should be in prison and stay there . 
  there were so many diplomatic cables that revealed how noble the us state department really was , full of adept analysis that showed real concern for human rights when it was being violated and showed how disgusted american diplomats where by the corruption they saw in foreign countries, 
  do n't compare the two . 
  chelsea manning deserves to be in prison for 35 years for what she did . 
  she has even admitted it herself . 
   red and blue are reversed in europe because commie eurosocialists, 
  theoretically we could get to the point where you 'd need a `` virtual visa '' in order to visit sites from another country . 
  virtual visa could be either a classic virtual visa issued by the country controlling the site you want to access or a virtual exit visa issued by your home country, 
  what a load of garbage , in the end ttip will be good for both of us and the world at large . 
  yea , economies will change but you can still create the socialist paradise you 've always dreamed of . 
  and i find it funny that some europeans are against it because they think it 's a scary american trick when in reality americans are more against it than europeans are . 
  so are moldovans direct descendants of the romans like the romanians , or what ? 
   `` we laugh at the cult of masculinity and the bling-bling , '' he wrote , `` but in the contempt there is also a grudging admiration for a way of life that we no longer have the confidence to strut . '' i really hope this is n't true . 
  because then we have a serious problem, 
  terrible bot idea, 
  there are actually quite \u00e4 few cool russians who comment in this sub . 
  and you need to understand there 's a difference between `` russian opinion '' and `` kremlin mandated russian opinion '' just because russian media spews something 24/7 does n't mean russians agree, 
  must stand by the land that gave us [ kosciuszko ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/kosciuszko_5c.jpg ) and [ pulaski ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/general_pulaski_1931_issue-2c.jpg ), 
  uh oh maybe they are going to scare off the russians with a division of `` filthy homosex '' soldiers, 
  apparently they are sending [ big red one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ieg0hup.jpg ) america 's oldest and most combat experienced infantry division . 
  they are probably equipped with the best equipment money can buy . 
  these are definitely the kinds of soldier you send if you expect to be fighting on the ukrainian steppe edit : the one is red because it 's been so soaked in blood over the years, 
  american jews are super progressive actually , i 'm not sure why exactly but they were very active in the civil rights movement in the south , marching alongside dr. king and such . 
  as far as philanthropy goes they support really progressive groups too . 
  i think this has to do with a part of jewish culture that develop in the old days in europe when jewish communities had to stick together and supported each other i.e. 
  the rich jews always made sure the poor jewish families got fed and the educated jews always made sure no jewish child was illiterate , no matter who 's child it was . 
  in the modern day i think they 've extended this mentality to the rest of americans . 
   watch cnn to know what i think cnn does n't even talk about this shit , they talk about celebrity selfies , lost aircraft and obamacare . 
  key word in comment `` vision '' very important , that word is . 
  yea lots of indians here . 
  and they 're all fucking republicans too . 
  george w. bush was ( and still is ) their hero . 
  at least the indian famolies i know, 
  it 's not the neoconservative perspective though . 
  neoconservatism is dead in the us , never to return to the white house or pentagon . 
  isolationism is the shiny new thing on the right in the us . 
  just so you know , because i 've seen europeans and russians throw that term around a lot lately and it 's really not appropriate to describe the way americans view international relations anymore . 
  edit : my god that , dude the co-founder of the new america foundation which has been sucking snowden 's dick since june . 
  it 's also run by the self-described ` russophile ' ann-marie slaughter, 
  no it 's not , but my personal vision was that europe , brazil and india would become new `` poles '' not autocratic russia . 
  autocratic superpowers are really not in the worlds best interests , considering that even democratic superpowers mess up and cause big damage . 
  there is something very serious going on in eastern europe and i think it 's extremely dangerous to just bury our heads in the sand . 
  and this is not propaganda , this publication is meant for an american academic / policy-making audience . 
  edit : and yea russia is totally a war-mongering imperialist nation . 
  `` let zem eat brioche '' but really , marie antoinette was austrian !, 
  you 're right , a lot of the improvements could be made by the private sector if russia would just clean up their legal system . 
  i remember ikea wanted to open up in st petersburg but called it off because they had to spend so much legal overhead . 
  no , we need to actually * scare * him . 
  that 's all he will understand .
