  based on the actions of moscow in the past few months ( ... also last few centuries ) we can wager that the claims in the video are entirely possible and unsurprising . 
  so for now , absent more concrete proof , it would be pragmatic to accept what the video says as true ; while remembering that if sufficient contradictory evidence turn up , then we must reverse our initial judgement . 
  tl ; dr pending further evidence , accept it as true . 
  i heard that euronutella has more hazelnut additive than amerinutella , so thankfully amerifat nutellavores wo n't be as harshly affected . 
  one could consider the npr window sticky on my rear windshield to be propaganda ; ( i personally have it there to advertise for them since i do n't donate ) but it does say `` look at me , im an educated progressive . 
  i 'm so worldly . '', 
  and thats kind of what this warsaw army parade is , polish propaganda saying : `` look at me , i 'm prepared for war . 
  i have all these tanks , no ones gon na fuck poland over ever again '' ... russian propaganda is different though , russian propaganda would be like me adding sirens , flashing lights , and details to my car to make it look like a police car . 
  which is a whole different ball game than an npr window stickey . 
  do n't compare manipulative fraud with window stickeys . 
   what are you talking about `` elected '' ? 
  the rurik dynasty had a tremendous number of heirs . 
  there were dozens of branches and nobles of rurik blood held various levels of authority in cities and regions throughout the rus ' lands . 
  the city councils of kyiv and novgorod had the power choose their princes amongst these nobles ( who all claimed to be of the rurik line ) . 
  they city councils could dismiss their prince and choose a new rurik prince . 
   moscovy ( russia ) is considered the protector of christian orthodox faith ( if you believe the third rome theory ) , the successor to roman and byzantine empires . 
  right ... im not really going to address that because i do n't to want to start the ( silly ) argument of who is the successor to rome and byzantium . 
  but you should know that muscovy was under heavy mongol influence for a very long time  do you mean vladimir the great no , he was a prince of kyiv , not a tsar of moscow . 
  the first tsar of moscow was ivan the terrible, 
  russia currently has the highest growth rate of aids in the world . 
  the average lifespan of russian men is 64 years among ethnic russian women , there are more abortions than live births the ethnic russian population is rapidly shrinking . 
  in 2070 , the ethnic russian population on russia will be half what it is now . 
  the muslim population , now at 20 + million , is growing like gangbusters edit : the eastern slavic culture must be saved , and moscow ca n't save it ; only kyiv can, 
   the rus people fought amongst each other , tribe vs tribe and eventually things got so bad , we invited rurik and the varangians to come and rule over us and establish order . 
  which he did when he landed near novgorod . 
  then his brother ( presumably ) , oleg was the one who moved the capital to kyiv . 
  yep , and then do you remember what happened in kyiv ? 
  * they developed a thriving civilization ruled by all free kyivan men and the prince they elected . 
  a mighty state governed by the rule of law , codified by the rus ' pravda . 
  the rulers of moscow are christian in name , but mongol at heart . 
  funny that the first `` christian ' tsar of moscow married 7 women and beat his daughter to death for immodesty ... thats something i 'd expect from a khan ... 
  [ you watch this video ] ( http://youtu.be/sinstpbmclo ) and then you tell me , who do you want to be the cultural leaders of modern rus ' : these devout , yet progressive , christians who are fighting for their civil liberties or an autocrat in moscow ? 
  now , regardless of who you want be the cultural leaders ; who do you think will be able to save the east slavs from the tragic social ills it faces ? 
  which group will lift ukraine and russia from the rampant drug addiction , soaring hiv rates , the rapid population decline , the mafia infestation , the alcoholism and lack of hope ? 
  and you may call that video propaganda , but it was created by an unpaid artist who was inspired by a beautiful ideology, 
  well pladimir is more like a bulldog - yea he 's aggressively anti-moscow , but when you engage with him in a level-headed way he is respectful vigorous is like a feral cat - he 's super aggressively anti-ukraine and is super hostile when you engage , even in a level-headed way . 
  ( get it ? 
  because bulldogs are aggressive to intruders but are friendly to nice people and feral cats are viscerally hostile to anything that even remotely approaches them ), 
  more like guy with a ukrainian grandfather who has been fascinated with the history of the east slavic peoples since first learning to read . 
  who believes that the capital of the `` rus world '' must move back to kyiv ; because moscow has become rotten to the core . 
  i personally believe that this is becoming a conflict between the progressives , small businessmen , academics and independent clergy of the east slavic world who now control kyiv and the old kgb elite and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in moscow for dominance over east slavic / modern rus ' civilization . 
  you want to restore the superpower status of the descendants of the rus ' ? 
  take away moscow 's iron grip on power , that city is cursed to breed autocrats - from tsar to soviet to ex-kgb elite . 
  and restore kyiv 's status as the rus ' seat of power . 
  i believe if this happens , then there is a chance for real social democracy to take root throughout modern rus ' . 
  as you probably know , the old rus ' was first ruled through kyiv , where the * vizhe * ( aka city council ) made up of all the free adult males in kyiv ruled . 
  while there was a prince who ruled most of the time , the * vizhe * had ultimate authority and could expel and replace the prince . 
  a shift came when byzantium fell to the turks and the economy of kyiv collapsed . 
  trade in all of europe shifted from the mediterranean to the hanseatic league , of which novgorod was a member city . 
  as novgorod became the center of rus ' economic activity , it also became the political center of rus ' . 
  there , in the novgorod ** republic ** the * vizhe * was even more powerful than it was in kyiv . 
  this republic , ruled by all of the free men of novgorod , thrived until ** the prince of moscow , ivan the terrible , and his mongol allies slaughtered the free men of novgorod and torched the city to the ground . 
  ** edit : this comment was written specifically for fans of kyivan-rus / ukraine / novgorod republic / russian history not for bizzarre ethno-nationalistic reasons, 
  i do n't mean to be rude , but i think you 're being a sourpuss about the matter . 
  hey , do n't hate on pladimir pladimirovitch all he does is post the links . 
  people find them interesting and upvote . 
  edit : fyi i have been waiting to say * pladimir pladimirovitch * for like , the past three weeks . 
   someone in russia comparing boy scouts with the hitler youth or buying european wine is * not * important it 's not someone in russia , it 's the russian embassy in estonia calling them nazis and its very high ranking russian officials who are buying sanctioned luxury items . 
  those tell us something interesting about the russian governing elite and their propaganda techniques . 
  how surprising , considering russia is the largest threat half of europe faces . 
  considering how russia is actively bullying most of eastern europe i think you 're a little detached , to be honest . 
  it 's like saying `` it 's so annoying that all those people in new orleans are obsessed with the huge hurricane that might be coming their way '' even though you know how devastated that city has been by hurricanes in the past . 
  and really though , what 's going on right now with russia , both internally and externally , will have as big a consequence throughout the world as 9/11 did . 
  also it 's as entertaining as it is important . 
  pardon my french , but russians doing crazy shit is entertaining as fuck . 
  that 's really why there are so many russia posts : * they actually are super entertaining * people like russia posts for the same reason they like russian dash cam videos . 
  now ** please ** do yourself a favor and go look up relationship between the holy roman empire and the european union . 
  it 's fascinating as fuck . 
  do n't hate me for saying this but ... iraq lost like 400,000 in that war and iran something around that too ... ukraine lost almost ** 10 million ** during the second world war . 
  also , both the iranian and the iraqi industrial capacity to rapidly mass produce armaments was nowhere near the industrial capacity of any of the major combatants of wwii ... 
  i 'm skeptical that either iran or iraq were able to produce even half of their war supplies domestically ... 
   europe gradually underwent various processes starting in the beginning of the late middle ages , running till today , that have allowed for the formation of what we see as `` modern '' , tolerant , rule-of-law nation-states here 's the thing though : church law and the legal authority of the church was a key piece to the development of the rule-of-law . 
  in the church you had the holder of supreme legal authority ; an authority that was the rock of god 's holy church . 
  but this supreme legal authority had a massive deficit of hard power . 
  so here we had a unique separation of powers in christendom : monarchs with hard power and the pope with divinely bestowed legal authority . 
  ( i know the system was so cut and dry , but these elements were very real and they laid the ground work for the development of a more sophisticated legal system ) this role was crystallized with crowning of charlemagne as hre . 
  initially it was an `` inheritance court '' due to the pope 's sole authority to anoint and crown europe 's monarchs . 
  while a claimant to a particular throne might have the hard power to reinforce his authority ; his regency would not have divine legitimacy and thus would be insecure - both to internal and external rivals . 
  the church 's authority in legal matters extended down to regional levels as well : abbeys , priories , dioceses etc all had a degree of authority in the feudal system . 
  monastic communities were often the keepers ( and publishers ) of records , wills , royal decrees , land deeds and other legal documents . 
  they were also entrusted with the task of reading , analyzing and authenticating ( is this the genuine royal seal or a forgery ? ), 
  said documents . 
  many minor legal disputes would first be taken up with church officials ( for example matthew the stutterer accuses karl the saxon of breaking his plow , and demands karl saxon fix it . 
  they visit brother john to mediate / pass judgment . 
  the result of brother johns judgement was considered valid , and punishment would be passed for disobeying it . ), 
  now it 's important to note that the church was not necessarily concerned with bringing about * justice * i.e. 
  determining who is correct and who is incorrect , but rather finding compromise between two parties ( to avoid violent conflict ) . 
  one huge case the pope arbitrated was between spain and portugal over territory in the new world . 
  through the treaty of tordesillas ; the pope drew a line on the map and said everything left of the line is spain 's and every right is portugals . . and that is why you get brazil on south america 's east coast and hispanic nations lining south america 's west coast ( argentina was the exception , but no one wanted patagonia and the rio de la plata flowed straight from heart of spanish territory . 
  also , portugal and spain , and later argentina and brazil both fought over whether uruguay was rightly portuguese or not ) another interesting legal case decided by a pope was determining whether native americans were human beings with souls or not . 
  after establishing that they could accept christ , the pope declared them human . 
  also in the later middle ages , we can see the rather sophisticated , complicated legal jungle of the hre . 
  senior church officials , played an integral role in his legal system . 
  in the highest tier of law - * makers * was made up of three princes and three prince-bishops . 
  those prince-bishops were directly under the hre in terms of rank . 
  the lower tier of law-makers was half lay aristocrats and half religious leaders : lesser bishops , powerful abbots and others . 
  christianity and the leaders of the christian faith played a major role in the development of hre legal system . 
  the hre high courts also sought to find compromise between parties rather than ascertain true justice . 
  this was especially important because these courts only dealt with princes , free-cities and other power players . 
  and if a major power player lost a court proceeding , they were likely to take up arms to get their desired result .
