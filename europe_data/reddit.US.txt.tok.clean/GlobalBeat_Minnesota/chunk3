  and , fyi there is a * very * strong argument to be made that eu legal institutions are in many ways the direct descendants of this hre system . 
  ** oh ** and christianity 's role in the development of modern western legal systems was n't only what it brought to the table ; but crucially what it ** did not ** bring to the table . 
  mainly , a set of rigid laws ** spoken from the mouth of god himself ** that governed a wide range of legal issues ; from divorce to inheritance to punishments for crimes ( both petty and great ) to clothing , food , and appropriate art . 
  while such laws exist in the old testament , they do not matter because christ declared that his law should replace the old law ex : love your enemies ; bless those that curse you and ; if one hits you on the right cheek , present him your other ( revenge is bad ) etc this is super important because it meant , christians ( at first just the senior catholic curia but later scholarly protestant theologians and nowadays , any joe shmoe ) could tamper and augment laws / theological doctrine without offending god . 
  there is much , ** much ** less room for modification of koranic / shariah / judaic law & amp ; amp ; doctrine in islam and judaism . 
  ex : some pope way back said it was a sin to eat meat on fridays during lent , then some pope after changed that dietary law saying that forgoing meat on fridays during lent was not a requirement . 
  no jewish or muslim leader could ever , * ever * declare that pork is now halal / kosher . 
  edit : i wrote this on my phone , and my hands are about to fall off so ... forgive the spelling / grammar, 
  catholics believe god inspired the writers of bible . 
  this is the official church teaching . 
  source : catholic school for my entire childhood, 
  i 'm down for that , we have money to spare . 
  pretty sure 30 billion has been approved and another 50 billion is being discussed ( that 's by the us alone ) . 
  and now that putin has given this conflict a terrible , bloody russia vs west dynamic , i 'm sure american voters would be quite supportive of giving even more aid . 
  the most traumatizing experience a society can have is armed conflict between multiple , evenly matched , heavily industrialized , technologically advanced societies . 
  mechanized war is essentially a massive human meat grinder . 
  cities incinerated , entire battalions of soldiers ripped to shreds in minutes ; weapons , tanks , planes , battleships , missiles and artillery mass produced at lightening speeds 24 / 7 ... 
  really has nothing to do with their genetic makeup ; more of their cultural makeup . 
  you do n't seriously believe that culture has no effect on a nations socio-political outcome , do you ? 
  and you mentioned christ-loving , and honestly i 'm an agnostic who holds no holdup of religion or whatever ; but christianity is a lot less rigid and legalistic - this has allowed christians to have more personal control over their beliefs ( which exploded after the printing press ) . 
  additionally , muslims and ultra-orthodox jews believe that their religious books * are the actual , direct words of god * . 
  they believe god / angels whispered the words in the prophets ear . 
  christians on the other hand , believe their holy books are * inspired * by god . 
  which fundamentally changes he dynamic . 
  additionally , there are numerous factual contradictions in the new testament ( one gospel says mary was there when jesus was crucified , another says she was absent ... devout christians believe both are equally * inspired * by god - that 's a massive theological difference ) this is a big deal , because it allowed christianity to drop the desert-shepherd mumbo-jumbo ( leviticus and shariah type laws ) . 
  which had the effect of creating a dynamic legal code ( pope at first says `` no usury '' then later pope says `` actually , usury is great '' and more importantly , pope says `` no heretics / burn heretics '' then after the reformation the pope says `` alright , being a heretic actually is n't a huge deal anymore '' ) the only real , laws devout christians are required to follow are the ten commandments ( sort of , because no . 
  2 says thou shall have no other gods before me , and then we paint pictures of venus and celebrate christian holidays that suspiciously are exactly the same as a previously celebrated pagan holiday - * dia de los muertos * in mexico is a catholic holy day , but it actually is pulled straight from aztec paganism / christmas is actually yule ) and the supreme commandment which is `` do unto others what you would do unto me [ christ ] '' which means christians should treat all other people like they are sacred creatures . 
  ( really tough to follow , also what does that mean exactly ? ), 
  this is why in the modern day , you can get super duper extremist christians who call for a new crusade and also get super duper extremist christians who are hippy pacifists . 
  over several centuries , religion can have a profound impact on the cultural development of a society . 
  and i do n't look down on islam btw , so please do n't say i 'm islamophobic . 
  yep , you 're right . 
  i feel that way because i 'm a hardcore imperialist . 
  has nothing to do with the how tragic belarus ' fate was when moscow brought them to heel . 
  also has nothing to do with the success that other culturally / politically similar nations such as poland and the baltics have had with the social democratic model . 
  no , i voted for him because my childhood coincided with the gw bush presidency ; and that traumatized my innocent brain so severely that the deal was sealed as soon as he said he would end the war in iraq . 
  yes i know , and i felt very victorian as i wrote that . 
  but it 's true , they are civilized . 
  isis and the taliban are not . 
  yes i admit my language was a tad too `` rudyard kipling '' but i voted for obama twice and rep. keith ellison ( who is black and muslim ) thrice . 
  realpolitik is real , and states do engage each other geopolitically but sometimes a potent mix of economic hardship and a desire for liberty / equality / fraternity causes the people to rise up ; storm the royal prison / armory , march on the palace , drag the king and queen to the guillotine , chop their fucking heads off and declare a republic . 
   in truth i think us/eu called russias bluff do n't insult ukrainians by suggesting that their noble revolution is the result of anything but the hard work that ukrainian civil activists have / are investing in it . 
  when you say `` us/eu called their bluff , '' you give the impression that maidan was just a western move in some grand geopolitical chess game with russia . 
  obama does n't give a fuck about russia , the germans had spent decades crafting their * ostpolitik * policy of engaging russia as a partner , france / italy / spain had a growing economic relationship with russia ( which they desperately needed after the 2008 crisis ) and * londongrad * was earning the british finance sector billions . 
   but , after 23 years of chaotic post-soviet independence , ukraine now has a wired and educated civil society prepared to fight for democracy and a leadership that knows how the west works and wants to emulate it . 
  when this thing started , ** so ** many people were saying that ukraine was doomed like the arab spring countries , iraq and afghanistan ; and i told them time and time again : * ukraine is different , ukraine is european : they 've been through worse ; they 've been locked in this same epic struggle for hundreds of years and they will succeed * and i was right . 
  they really are an inherently civilized people . 
  john mccain said something of that ilk in his 2008 presidential campaign against obama i suppose we should start paying attention to our aging cold warriors again ; their experience still applies as long as the old kgb types rule russia . 
   6.2 % really ? 
  unemployment in the upper midwest it nearly half that ... n dakota - 2.7 % s dakota - 3.8 % mn - 4.4 % iowa - 4.5 % and even barbarian nebraska is at 3.5 %, 
  hypothetical europe 2050 : english is the dominant language , but spanish is now indispensable , and it has replaced german as the number two language . 
  there is also a proud francophone region which fiercely protects it 's linguistic purity . 
  ... kind of reminds me of this other continent i know, 
  wow guy , i have to tell you that you are ignoring a lot of loopholes and other ways that make it easy for unworthy people to get guns . 
  in mn we have some effective gun laws ( not strict , but smart ) . 
  i personally am a progressive democrat and i own a gun ( for funzies ) , this is typical here since guns are not a partisan issue . 
  so in this state , one must be a responsible person with a sound mind in order to legally obtain a firearm . 
  however , if you go across state lines to wisconsin or south dakota , any old dumbfuck with an iq of only 70 can get a high-powered firearms with very little hassle . 
  the gun culture varies a lot in the us . 
  i think in some of the more northerly states with vast tracts of wilderness , the gun culture is different and probably shares a lot in common with swiss gun culture . 
  for example , where i 'm from people who : * have a criminal history of violent crime or significant property theft are prohibited from obtaining or owning firearms ( however , those convicted of petty crimes are allowed to ) * have a record of significant mental illness ( extreme depression , psychosis etc ) are prohibited from obtaining or owning forearms and people are required to spend a certain number of hours at a shooting range and must take gun safety courses , and pass a test in order to own most firearms ( i think basic hunting rifles do n't require the course )  lanza i personally believe that cases such as his are not the result of poor gun culture or lax guns laws but rather inadequate mental health care . 
  i suspect this will change once obama 's health care reforms begin to bear fruit . 
  edit : also i think it 's better to describe our gun laws and swiss gun laws as `` smart '' rather than `` strict . '', 
  so , context is needed for `` hate crime '' concept . 
  the idea of hate crimes was developed in the united states during the civil rights movement of the 1960 's ( that 's when that martin luther king jr. guy was active ) . 
  in those days in the deep south , blacks would often face violence ( and in rare cases , murder ) because they defied the racial status quo . 
  the white perpetrators of said crimes would rarely , if ever , be brought to justice for their crimes against blacks because in the us almost all crimes are death with by states and most southern states would willfully refuse to carry out the law . 
  in response the federal government enacted hate crime legislation that made hate crimes a federal offense . 
  this distinction gave the federal government the authority to step in and bring the murderers / perpetrators to justice before a national court instead of a state court . 
  idk about europe though , might have the same motivations ( ie a crime against gays in a really religious region would be tried in a less religious region to ensure an unbiased ruling ), 
  coming from north america ( aka the wonderful land of grizzlies , black bears , wolves , bobcats , lynx , cougars , coyotes , wolverines and wild boars ) i have to say i disagree with you . 
  man , if wolves are killing sheep then i totally support my tax money being thrown at some poor farmer every once and a while if it means that we can have wolves . 
  some things are just important because * they 're just important * . 
  wildlife is one of those things . 
  looks like they just make jokes about eesti, 
  every american with an iq of average and above ... pretty much from charlemagne until 1776 , we learn world history with a heavy england focus . 
  also , high schools ( at least in my state ) are required to fill an entire years worth of curriculum with british literature, 
  or germany or sweden or the turks or the mongols ;-) edit : jokes of course, 
  [ very relevant map answering the question : `` what country does your country joke about the most ? 
  this is a classic and well known joke in the states as well heard it so many times and it still makes me laugh, 
  * rule britannia * and * le marseillaise * because they harken back to the old days when britain and france were constantly fighting each other for world domination . 
  i always imagine a huge army , filled with soldiers with fancy hats , gloriously marching to battle when i hear * le marseillaise * and i always image a gigantic flotilla of warships , gloriously sailing to battle when i hear * rule britannia *, 
   impossible to sing yes , i swear it was written with the intent that it be sung exclusively by large , soulful black women . 
  definitely read that like a speech that was announced through an old timey radio . 
  black people . 
  that 's the boogeyman they use : '' * if we offer adequate social welfare services , the blacks are going to come and devour the welfare - turning the white man into tax-slaves . 
  * '' . . even though the * vast * majority of welfare benefits are claimed by white people . 
   getting miffed at fox news is pretty played out here in the states . 
  basically an eye roll and a head shake is the only response i agree , and honestly i sometimes watch fox news * solely * because i want to get some energy from getting a little riled up ( kind of like how self-mutilation makes masochists ` feel alive ' ) . 
  but then sometimes , if you really think about the toxic effect that fox news has had on our political culture , it can * really * bum you out . 
  fox news ' effect in the us is probably akin to the effect that kremlin propaganda outlets have in russia . 
  as an american , there is really only one way for me appropriately respond this video ... [ the shame is unbearable ] ( https://markystar.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/seppuku-o.gif ), 
   shropshire that is a ridiculously charming name for an ~ ~ english ~ ~ region edit : fuck , i mean welsh region, 
  how about not ... we are completely secure where we are in north america . 
  let 's just continue to support japan & the philippines in their tiff with china ; support poland , the baltics & ukraine in their tiff with russia ; and lend logistical support to our european / asia-pacific allies when they need it . 
  we should do nothing more . 
  such blatant homophobia, 
  okay , go check out tunisia , they 're making pretty solid progress . 
  dude , democracy do n't turn a country into a stable , economic engine over night ; it takes many decades . 
  but . .
