  but ... midwesterners have always taken pride in being * wild germans * i.e. 
  when you release a german into the lawless wilds of north america , they revert to their true barbarian nature . 
  but really though , the german and scandinavian influence on the midwestern character is profound and is probably * the * defining feature that separates us from the rest of american sub-cultures . 
  as long as brazil has influence and power , its not so bad . 
  they have good values, 
  wait , what ? 
  expl\u00edcame por favor, 
  i said average . 
  and you can have reasonable republicans , for example some good ones have come out of maine and washington state, 
   * full of moors haha i love it so much that you still call them that and that it 's still a problem that there moors on spanish territory, 
  it 's actually really fascinating how * similar * the average russian and the average southern white american are in terms of worldview and ideology . 
  so , on a scale from 1 to juche ; how psychologically groomed to hate russian progressives do you think you are ? 
  yea , but does the us produce holy meat , [ blessed by an entire convent of romanian orthodox nuns ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oyc4g8q.jpg ) ? 
  would us authorities really deny romanian orthodox christians in the us their constitutional right to practice their faith in the traditional way : with several tons of blessed meat for every meal ? 
  * wrap it in white cloth , fumigate it with frankincense , stamp a cross on the cloth , use an orthodox nun as your `` mule '' and say it 's holy meat - it would zip on through customs *, 
  yea but , they 've been with us ( westerners ) since * before * collapse of the roman empire . 
  i 'm not being racist , i 'm just saying that 2,000 years of history kind of justifies ultra orthodox jews in their little communities ... whereas muslims do n't have that historical precedent ( in europe ) of such behavior . 
  jews going off and establishing faith communes is the same as hardcore christians going off and establishing faith communes . 
  i agree , and it 's actually cheaper too . 
  russia rejects your cow products in an act of economic warfare ? 
  it 's okay , just call it sell it to americans and call it freedom beef !!!, 
  the kkk was n't a single entity . 
  sort of an amorphous series of social movements . 
  there is n't really one kkk that has been in continuous existence . 
  the first klan was established after the civil war , it was an vigilante attempt by white southerners to wrestle back some of the authority they lost after defeat . 
  as white southerners began to regain * mainstream * political power , the klan started to fade away ( aggressive law enforcement from the federal government helped too ) . 
  this is kkk 1.0 then in the last two decades of the 1800 's alone , a whopping 25 million european immigrants poured into the us . 
  only a tiny portion of whom were protestant `` anglo-saxons . '', 
  most were irish , italians , germans , poles , russians , hungarians , greeks , jews ... 
  this surge in newcomers caused a panic amongst native , white protestant anglo americans . 
  this panic pumped new blood into the kkk . 
  this is kkk 2.0 and kkk 2.0 was more nativist than racist , ( they targeted white , european immigrants ) . 
  the patriotic wave of wwii ( a pro-unity , `` were in this fight together '' wave ) along with increased pressure from the feds , swept away kkk 2.0 kkk 3.0 swept into being as a back lash against the civil rights movement of the 1960 's . 
  they wanted to `` keep blacks in their place . '', 
  again , kkk 3.0 came about at time when white southerners felt like they were losing power ( the federal govt imposed civil rights on the south ) . 
  kkk 3.0 faded away as well . 
  today there is a kkk , but it 's full of legit weirdos and has no influence . 
  the other 3 `` real '' kkk 's actually had a good deal of political power . 
  read his first sentence over again . 
  he 's taking about a full scale invasion , not some punks trying to rob him . 
  i agree , we 've got a big somali refugee population where i live ; and my state insists on busing all the somali children from the inner city where they live to all around the metro area : somali kids from the same block get shuttled away to different ends of the city , [ like dragonballs ] ( http://www.picgifs.com/movies-and-series/series/dragon-ball-z/picgifs-dragon-ball-z-8777801.gif ) . 
  it 's more expensive , but they had to do it because they literally began tribal warfare ( * warefare jr. * - knives instead of guns ) when they all went to the same schools ( legit , actual tribal / clan warfare ), 
  to my ears , the south wales uk accent and any irish accent are absolutely charming and sweet . 
  in heaven , the angels speak with those accents , i suppose the [ seraphim ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gaxca65.jpg ) speak with an irish accent and the [ cherubim ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uvbnbzw.jpg ) with a south wales accents . 
  well these ones were at least smart enough to call it `` sao-in '' and not `` sam-hayne '', 
  the witches student group at my university very vocally protests halloween every year because it `` commercializes samhain '', 
   tomter we have something called tom thumb . 
  he 's a little magic guy whose name is tom and he 's the size of a thumb . 
  and he 's associated with sweets . 
  i wonder if scandinavian immigrants brought over tomter and he integrated into tom thumb edit : actually he 's from an old english fairy tale !, 
  * it is said that in the days of the famed prince arthur , who was king of britain , in the year 516 , there lived a great magician , called merlin , the most learned and skilful enchanter in the world at that time . 
  this great magician , who could assume any form he pleased , was travelling in the disguise of a poor beggar , and being very much fatigued , he stopped at the cottage of an honest ploughman to rest himself , and asked for some refreshment . 
  the countryman gave him a hearty welcome , and his wife , who was a very good-hearted , hospital woman , soon brought him some milk in a wooden bowl , an some coarse brown bread on a platter . 
  merlin was much pleased with this homely repast and the kindness of the ploughman and his wife ; but he could not help seeing that though everything was neat and comfortable in the cottage , they seemed both be sad and much cast down . 
  he therefore questioned them on the cause of their sadness , and learned they were miserable because they had no children . 
  the poor woman declared , with tears in her eyes , that she should be the happiest creature in the world if she had a son ; and although he was no bigger than her husband 's thumb , she would be satisfied . 
  merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a man 's thumb , that he made up his mind to pay a visit to the queen of the fairies , and ask her to grant the poor woman 's wish . 
  the droll fancy of such a little person among the human race pleased the fairy queen too , greatly , and she promised merlin that the wish should be granted . 
  accordingly , a short time after , the ploughman 's wife had a son , who , wonderful to relate !, 
  was not bigger than his father 's thumb . 
  the fairy queen , wishing to see the little fellow thus born into the world , came in at the window while the mother was sitting up in bed admiring him . 
  the queen kissed the child , and , giving it the name of tom thumb , sent for some of the fairies , who dressed her little favorite as she bade them . 
  * - from project gutenburg, 
  they were * imperial * yes , but not quite * colonial * in the same way . . somalia / libya and the congo are not tied to italy and belgium in the same way as quebec / algeria / sierra leone are to france , or canada / america / australia / new zealand to the uk , or latin america is to spain and portugal .

  ha ha , i did n't calculate i randomly chose a tiny fraction to be humorous . 
  i just know i have an ancestor who was `` from around prague '' on my maternal grandma 's side . 
  it 's ethnic asshole , i was baptized in the greek catholic church , two of my grandpa 's older brothers died fighting for ukrainian independence against the nazis / soviets and my grandpa was taken to austria as a * zwangsarbeiter * on account of his older brothers actions . 
  they sacrificed a lot for ukraine and i 'm not going to dishonor them by forgetting the heritage they left me . 
  edit : and you should not that i tried to be all politically correct by saying i had 1/4 * ukrainian blood * instead of 1/4 ukrainian ( since europeans are super sensitive about that ), 
  as man of 1/4 ^ th ukrainian blood and 1/3425 ^ th czech blood , i say we use this day to look back upon the prehistoric [ * slavic dreamtime * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6dcnbjx.jpg ) when our ancestors were still [ mysterious forrest-dwellers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ijdlkag.jpg ) who carved [ these silly , yet spiritual , stones ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r26m4av.jpg ) and knew that [ swatiskas represented the sun god ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mkctkpl.jpg ) and * not * genocidal austrians . 
  forget the ethnic * blah blah blah * , just use slavic friendship day to ponder our ancestors : their worldview , their fears , their daily lives , their spirituality , their superstitions , their lost wisdom etc. . 
   the us is an imperial power hidden behind treaties says the british guy . 
  yea , it says junk food but i think all the asians and mexicans have pushed us down as a collective, 
  do n't mistake the us left for being right leaning , i think it 's just that the american right is so staunchly right that the american left has to move right, 
  * shooting * them would n't even be unreasonable force , if there actually were kicks to the head involved, 
  yea i 'm pretty sure he is actually improving the catholic church , which is a colossal task . 
  i say spain replaces juan carlos ii with president muj\u00edca . 
  it 's time someone do to the spanish crown what bergolio did to the papacy . 
  she would be in the mental state of being whose psyche has been fertilized by the ineffable majesty of elysium , irradiated by the shadowy horrors of hades and baptized by the swirling , bloody seas of tartarus . 
  * `` in place of a dark queen , we will set up an iron lady . 
  and i shall not be dark , but beautiful and terrible as the morning and the night !, 
  fair as the sea and the sun and the snow upon the mountain !, 
  dreadful as the storm and the lightning !, 
  stronger than the foundations of the earth . 
  all shall love me and despair !,

  ** old world : ** 10,000 years of ethnic struggle create states that are centered around ethnicity . 
  ** new world : ** 5,000 years of ethnic struggle that is almost totally erased when western europeans come , conquer even the most powerful native empires , latinize / anglicize the natives , enslave them and when  50 % of them die off from disease they import millions of africans to replace them . 
  now let everything boil for 500 years , add a sprinkle of east asians , a heaping load of christianity , a dash of judaism , and ( while the native part dissolves to almost nothing ) , pour in another 50 million europeans , and 10 million africans . 
  make sure to constantly stir to ensure the individual ingredients constantly mix together . 
  tl ; dr the new world is a result of amerindian , african , asian and european cultures being forced to smoosh together by the brits , french , iberians and their colonial successors . 
  the history syncretism between such disparate cultures makes it easier to absorb new cultures . 
  uk is different , and france is too . 
  their huge empires made them different , but even they would not fair well if their native ethnic groups lost their majorities . 
  and it 's not really a matter of ethno-nationalism , it 's a matter of social cohesion and the undeniable reality that european nations are generally defined around a certain ethno-linguistic group . 
  that 's not a reflection of those states as being backwards , it 's just how human beings organize themselves when given enough time . 
  honestly i do n't believe this article . 
  * this claim is coming from a russian website . 
  given the falsehoods and lies of the past few months , i really ca n't bring myself to trust any russian website * those `` peoples republic of donetsk / luhansk '' guys already have a solid track record of * gruesome murder * * they have a track record of brutal , senseless violence * they also have a track record of intimidating journalists and spreading vicious propaganda * i have no doubt that these types of thugs have it in them to do this , anyone who has seen that video where russian neo-nazis decapitated a central asian migrant worker will agree .
