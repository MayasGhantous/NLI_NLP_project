  i at least want to do what germany did to greece after the eurocrisis . 
  except more ; like force them to teach evolution , introduce social reforms to get southern blacks out of absurd poverty , eliminate the death penalty , enact judicial reform to stop the racist overcriminalization of southern blacks , undo their gerrymandering , clip the wings of southern political dynasties , force them to actually enforce proper environmental regulations . . and etc the eu forced potential new members to enact certain key reforms , i want to force our already existing underperforming members to enact certain key reforms as well . 
  edit : and yea , i know it 's politically untenable, 
  no , i just want to temporarily take away their states rights and impose northern social values on them until they learn how to properly govern themselves . 
  our country would be far better off and as a result the world would be better off too . 
  edit : reconstruction was ended to early anyway because president grant fucked it up . 
  they 're pulling us down , and they have consciously chosen to do so . 
  they are obsessed with their own backwardness . 
  you know as well as i do that 90 % of the negative stereotypes of americans and negative impressions of america are from the south . 
  another 5 % from new jersey . 
  it 's shit like this suggests we need to reimpose reconstruction on the south . 
  i 'm not saying northern states do n't have problems , but i am saying that the south is sucking down the rest of country through its absolute , stalwart opposition to change . 
  honestly , we would be better off letting the south secede and uniting with canada ... ( and then reconquering the south and reimposing reconstruction ), 
  did ... did you not watch the same video i did ? 
  once it hit that war montage , the argument is sealed . 
  the european union is good . 
  period . 
  congratulations to both of us for being from a pretty neat place !, 
  minneapolis, 
  see my reply to him . 
  he also might not have a total feel for the culture of american politics , since a lot of stuff on politico is only exciting if you know certain obscure facts about the topic or know the obscure social connections and background of the person being interviewed / quoted . 
  like the article about dgse spying is a lot more interesting if you know the drama of * merkels handy-aff\u00e4re * because you know if dgse is spying on the us ; you better bet they 're listening on merkels handy too . 
  1 ) west wing and house of cards fanboys / girls are a pretty educated bunch . 
  they fucking cover american politics , the pinnacle of voyeurism . 
  you can not write about us politics without being voyeuristic . 
  and that 's okay , voyeurism is n't * always * bad . 
  3 ) they cover the issues almost exclusively through the words , statements and actions of politicians . 
  do n't expect investigative journalism other than digging for insider gossip , hunting for leaked emails or covering obscure political galas / forums / book signings . 
  4 ) they are featured daily on npr , and therefore rank among the gold standard of american news media - if npr recommends it , then it 's golden . 
  no sarcasm at all . 
  it 's not biased because they do n't really give opinion , unless it 's an opinion piece . 
  they just provide top notch political analysis . 
  it gives real insight , and the people that work for them also work on capitol hill or worked for politicians in the past . 
  they follow around policy makers to the most random venues where no other press goes ( like at a book signing or whatever ) . 
  they have [ stories like this ] ( http://politi.co/1szwhep ) that no one else in the country talks about because it 's really low key , but actually revealing or off the cuff statements from politicians who are not super famous nationally , but still are very influential . 
  [ sen. rockefeller talks about racism against obama in the legislature ] ( http://politi.co/1jif2q7 ) ( * nobody * touches this issue , despite the fact it 's true ), 
  by the way , politico is * the premier * source if you want to know about american politics . 
  [ map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/castellano-espa%c3%b1ol-en.png ) since mexicans say espa\u00f1ol that 's all i was taught for the 9 years of spanish i took . 
  when i visited tarragona in catalonia a few years ago ; i visited this roman museum and asked for an english audio tour ... 
  they were out . 
  and the dude emotionlessly replies `` espa\u00f1ol no existe '' with a completely flat face . 
  i thought he meant they 're all out of spanish audio guides , so i asked for one in italian and had suffer though trying to hispanify the words in my head . 
  i later read a travel guide that informed me how stupid i was . 
  more like 50-70 years . 
  and soon after you started losing the empire , you coincidentally became ` partners in neo-colonialism ' with france , joined nato and joined the eu / it 's precursors ... 
   tiny island packed to the brim with 60 million people has done fine so far . 
  yea , thanks to the massive empire you had for the past 300 years . 
  i was making a point that ** most ** britons are center-left ( labour ) , center-right ( conservative ) or are people who believe bullshit as long as it comes from a charismatic / entertaining source ( ukip ), 
  singapore is a strategically located microstate . 
  under proper management , microstates have enormous economic and financial advantages . 
  the congo has a shit government . 
  both canada and australia have top quality governance and a remarkable capacity to manage their vast natural wealth . 
  new zealand has a very small population , basically a microstate with lots of territory . 
  let 's compare advantages : * continent packed full of treasure ( natural resources ) with 20 million people * half a continent full of treasure with 35 million people , * half a continent full of treasure and fertile farmland with 320 million people * and a fertile , temperate island country ( larger than great britain ) with 4.5 million people . 
  vs * tiny island packed to the brim with 60 million people , whose economy relies heavily on trade with the economic superpower that lies 20 miles away . 
  bonus : a sizable chunk of its territory is mulling over whether to declare independence or not . 
  this left wing region values ties with europe and would probably see a eu exit and the resulting economic crisis as huge motivator to separate . 
  dear uk ( ip ) leaving the eu will destroy your country . 
  in the short term and the long term . 
  stop being a shit-head and think . 
  also the way you act towards bulgarians and romanians is downright shameful . 
  sincerely , canada , america , australia , and new zealand . 
  most brits can be stereotyped into three categories : those who read the guardian , those who read the telegraph and those who read the dailymail . 
  you sir , are the kind that reads the dailymail . 
  okay , have you seen a map of the aegean ? 
  so many islands , some of which are almost touching the turkish coast ... is it even possible to navigate those waters or that airspace without violating greek territorial waters / airspace ? 
  no one knows anything about it and instead of waiting for the terms of the agreement to be revealed , everyone is freaking out and saying it 's the end of civilization . 
  * there is no evidence of acta ii * there is no evidence of anything * because the treaty is still being written * the full text will be released and then the eu parliament and the us congress will vote to accept it or not . 
   hands are tied because of eu regulations thank god for that, 
  except the are further corrupting the current system by being a den for a massive mafia . 
  fuck that , russia is part of an * old * order of power !, 
  where it was just russia vs usa . 
  let 's have the eu get a common foreign policy and defense , to be a counter weight to americans ( in case of george w bush types becoming commander-in-chief ) and let 's help latin america get it 's shit together ( quite a tough job , but easier than asia and africa . 
  same level of fucked up-ness as ex-ussr countries ) and have latin america ( brazil , mexico ) be a counter weight to both the eu and the us that 's my dream for the world and it certainly does not include a powerful , aggressive mafia-state . 
  tl ; dr entities that should rule the world : ** europe ** , ** america ** and a modernized ** latin america ** entities that should * not * rule the world : ** russia **, 
  holy shit the abortion rate is astronomical compared to europe 's, 
  weimar triangle is more important anyway . . no offense , but what ally is better : france or slovakia ? 
  germany or hungary ? 
  but also , is n't slovakia defying gazprom by reverse the flow of gas back to ukraine this fall ? 
  that 's fascinating , but the second part of my question was asking whether he 's inbred or not ? 
  it 's wsws , it 's a nutjob russophile site . 
  only idiots take it seriously . 
  what ?!, 
  there are still hapsburgs ?? 
  and he does n't look so deformed , is n't that a prerequisite ? 
  russia has banned their communist party too , right ? 
  i 'm gon na guess that it 's because of falling russkiy trade . 
  shakespeare 's legacy ? 
  russian media is calling the government in kyiv terrorists too . 
  so it goes both ways . 
  i 'm sure there is a neighborhood or city that is either mostly jewish or roma . 
  just make a vatican city type area for all of those neighborhoods . 
  if autonomy for all ethnicities is really that important to hungarians then that should n't be a problem . 
  pretty sure germans and jews were in hungary before the magyars invaded . 
  they will be . 
  they do n't need too , ukraine will join the eu one day and schengen so it wo n't really matter . 
  anyway , how about giving jews in hungary autonomy ? 
  how about germans ? 
  and roma as well ? 
  it 's only fair .
