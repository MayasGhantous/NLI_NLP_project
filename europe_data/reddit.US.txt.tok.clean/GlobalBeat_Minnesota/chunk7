  well they can vote , ca n't they ? 
  problem solved . 
  that 's like saying the 11 million or so spanish speaking latinos in the us deserve their own special autonomous region . 
  they do n't need their own region they can participate in the political life the same as everyone else . 
  does n't that not matter anymore since it 's apart of schengen ? 
  it 's 200,000 thousand people for gods sakes . 
  that 's like , nothing . 
  besides they 're in far western ukraine which is the best part , so there 's no need to be upset . 
  it is, 
  * china and russia share a big , long , border . 
  * they both have to deal with separatist regions . 
  * their naval power is limited * they both have historically hostile enemies at one flank , russia with europe and china with japan / east asia ; potentially unpredictable muslim nations who must be controlled for safety at another flank - the stans / mideast * at their last flank , they have each other . 
  this is what pushes them together the most : they do n't want to create trouble on another massive part of their frontier . 
  if they became hostile to each other , we would see a fight for influence in central asia potentially with proxy-wars , provocations of each other 's historical enemies ( russia allies with japan/taiwan/korea and china allies with poland/ukraine/baltics ) which would really put a dagger at each other 's throats , and yes , even a potential land war between the two . 
  it 's not so much that they are friends , it 's that they are too afraid of being enemies . 
  so , what makes you so pro-ukip ? 
  it would be like the ` tea party ' faction within the republican party . 
   we would let foreigners extract our shale gas are they 're any romanian companies that have the proper technology to safely extract shale gas ? 
  if not , then its probably a good idea to let foreign companies that have developed the technology to extract it . 
   the oligarchy came about almost entirely because of dodgy laws passed during regans presidency though and then the supreme court justices appointed during the bush years who struck down 40 years worth of campaign finance reform in 2010 . 
  what 's this book and where can i pirate it ? 
  the kremlin arguably has the worlds best propaganda team , they know how to cover their tracks . 
  haha 100 % of all europeans are in welfare . 
  you 're using the argument of american racists , but it does n't work in europe . 
  the war of european unification . 
  grids need to be connected . 
  iirc the us has 3 power grids : east , west and texas . 
  europe needs to have at most 3 , and all of eastern europe ( russia 's favorite prey ) need to be connected with the german power grid . 
  well ... good for the eu, 
   we might go back in the 70s or 80s when the soviets were funding the extremists in europe . 
  * might * ? 
  i think it 's already happened , to be honest . 
  yea , i think that 's only because being pro-russia is way too controversial in britain, 
  damn straight , because they are good fucking people . 
  rt just makes shit up anyway , i really do n't care if we give them pr ammunition . 
  because literally anything we do , they will spin it into pr ammunition . 
  its all about bringing a washington security umbrella to ukraine 's fledging , besieged oil and gas industry if hunter biden and devon archer wanted to get rich in the oil and natural gas industry , they would do business in their own country or in canada . 
  plenty of hydrocarbon money to go around in north america due to the shale boom . 
  instead , they chose to do business in one of the most volatile business environments on earth . 
  i think biden jr. and archer are doing this out of service to society and not to get rich . 
  there are much , much easier ways for these guys to get rich than via burisma . 
  you 're missing the point bout those stations being important for russian ecologists and scientists . 
  russia is hurting itself to spite the us , and doing so loudly . 
  which is sort of a tantrum . 
  strengths of europe are strengths of the eu, 
  the biden 's are good people and dedicated public servants . 
  this is not corruption , this is opening up the floodgates for american investment into ukraine . 
  ... also ## former polish president aleksander krasniewski is on the board of directors too . 
  i just have to say , i have no doubt that hunter biden took this job to serve others . 
  i am 100 % convinced he has noble intentions . 
  the biden 's are good people and devoted public servants . 
  ~ ~ although , if this was the cheneys , i 'd be screaming bloody murder . ~ ~ edit : i just realized that this company will blow all of the decrepit , corrupt oil and natural gas companies out of the water in terms of efficiency and innovation . 
  * also the website states that biden and his associate plan to bring western technology from american oil and gas firms into ukraine * they aim to attract western financiers ( who will flock to them over their competition for the obvious reason that investing with these new england boys is a lot safer than with ukrainian oligarchs ) * the website says they aim to be the biggest oil company in eastern europe . 
  ( which is crazy ambitious because gazprom ) * website says they plan to use the already existing pipelines in ukraine to transport fuel to europe * there are two americans on the board of directors , one cypriot , and one greek . 
  ** all of their upper-level management is ukrainian . 
  ** * ## former polish president aleksander kwasniewski ( 1995-2005 ) is also on the board of directors, 
  well you do n't even need to become a federalized state to accept the concept . 
  a loose confederation of sovereign states still needs symbols to help glue them together . 
  i think they 're low-level , petty traitors . 
  i would n't say they are evil or criminal for this , but they certainly are super trashy for this . 
  i know europeans do n't see flags the same way as americans , but when you have a big , diverse population that needs to be united ; symbols of unity are very important . 
  even if you do n't think they are , they are , they have a powerful subconscious psychological effect . 
  this symbolism ** is not as important when you 're ethnically bound to your countrymen . 
  ** in absence of ethnic bonds , symbols of unity are vital . 
  just look at what the eu flag meant to the maidan protestors , they were not waving the eu flag as snipers shot them down because they were so obsessed with the eu bureaucracy and regulations , but because they saw the eu flag for what it really was : a symbol of a profoundly revolutionary social movement unlike anything the world has seen . 
  so , if if you want to seal europe together , you need to give it a special symbol . 
  real quick excerpt that demonstrates why the american flag is so important to americans ** and this is certainly relevant to european union ** ... ## the civil war made the flag an important symbol of north-south unity ### ____________________________________________  the modern meaning of the flag was forged in december 1860 , when major robert anderson moved the u.s. garrison from fort moultrie to fort sumter in charleston harbor . 
  this was the opening move of the civil war , and subsequently the flag was used throughout the north to ** symbolize american unity and rejection of secessionism . 
  **  before that day , the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of american territory , flown from forts , embassies , and ships , and displayed on special occasions like american independence day . 
  but after major anderson 's surprising stand , and as the long winter of 1861 turned into spring , that old flag meant something new . 
  ** the abstraction of the union cause was transfigured into a physical thing : ** strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for , and many thousands die for . 
  ______________________________________ ~ * 1861 : the civil war awakening * by adam goodheart, 
  and the dirty slavs !, 
  but that 's ... . that 's why you * should * post here to show a more balanced view of bulgarians . 
  quick question : is serbia like the us where there 's a big crazy part ( south ) and a big reasonable part ( north ) or is it mostly nutty people with a slim portion of reasonable people ? 
  well we already had a huge army in europe , we had european allies with armies on the continent and we had just defeated japan in a war were we had to ship our forces across the entire pacific , so we had the technique and skill to do so in europe . 
  and so estonia shows her true colors ... and they are very beautiful indeed . 
   i believe that my assistance in consulting the company on matters of transparency , corporate governance and responsibility , international expansion and other priorities will contribute to the economy and benefit the people of ukraine . '' he 's helping develop ukraine 's gas industry up to western standards . 
  the biden family are the best sorts of people and personally i trust them completely . 
  joe biden =\\ = dick cheney, 
  i googled it and one couric is equal to the weight of katie couric . 
   russian imperialism , service to the sovereign and the heavenly mandate of the russian orthodox church . 
  oh , so now they 're regressing back to fucking feudalism ? 
   this is n't exactly news yea but it 's fun to talk about , this is n't / r/europenews after all . 
  hungarians have been in the us for thousands of years . 
  everyone knows that , duh also , is your name a play on katie couric ? 
  because thats super random for some hungarian guy on the internet . 
  yea that 's true , but were still a hell of a lot less plutocratic than russia or china , so if that 's your argument for supporting russia then ... 
  it 's a pretty bad argument . 
  no i was talking about russkiy imperialist aggression, 
  200,000 hungarians in ukraine ? 
  that 's it ? 
  i am positive there are more people of pure magyar lineage in the us than that , so why does n't orb\u00e1n make a fuss about them ??? 
  could it possibly be he 's not talking about hungarians in north america because the us is n't vulnerable and crippled in the face of imperialist aggression ? 
  definitely pirating that, 
  well the thing is , western countries have shown a remarkable ability to progress forward via internal social movements ; whether it 's britain giving india independence peacefully , the us granting civil rights to blacks or generally all western societies being at the forefront of women 's rights , gay rights , minority rights etc. 
  there 's just so much evidence of this ... america has a black president , the netherlands has a gay pm , the taoiseach met with the queen , the german government is a ardent protector of privacy ... all that would have been unthinkable 25 years ago but our style of society is fluid , malleable and ever changing . 
  i do n't know about your country , but i feel that american society is always progressing ( even if its often at a snails pace ), 
  i kind of assumed that those guys would have been to burn out to continue fighting , but now that i think of it britain , canada and australia were probably able to give it another go . 
   united fruit , the coups in the honduras and guatemala , the contra affair , operation condor , supporting pinochet , etc.
