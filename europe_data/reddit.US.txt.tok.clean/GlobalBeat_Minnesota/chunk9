  you 're comment represents the mainstream narrative in the west and that demonstrates my point . 
  there are a lot of people in the west who share your sentiments about western imperialism . 
  there are not many in russia who share similar sentiments about russian imperialism and such sentiments are certainly not the mainstream view . 
  they have a bunch of movies and bbc specials about their imperialist past . 
  also , the british recognize that india , canada , australia , british africa and the rest ** are not ** part of britains exclusive sphere of influence . 
  well , bulgaria was under russian control for 45 years and is poor because of it . 
  if they want to be poor for another 45 years , then yea they should return to russian control . 
  the british , french , spanish , portuguese , dutch , belgians and americans have all worked hard to correct the shame brought on by their imperialist pasts and to reconcile with their former subjects . 
  in contrast , neither russia or japan have attempted to reconcile their imperialist pasts . 
  it 's no surprise that both of these former imperialist powers are reviled by their former subjects . 
  korea , china and pretty much all of southeast asia hates japan . 
  and pretty much all of eastern europe hates russia . 
  russia must acknowledge its dark past , and not just acknowledge it but the lessons need to really soak in . 
  sarcastic , yet insightful . 
  they 've changed their name because they 're a fucking mercenary company and everyone automatically hates them for that because mercenaries are basically legal hit men . 
  okay , i 'm not about to defend blackwater but they do have their uses and are disciplined , highly trained mercenaries . 
  they would n't be in business if they were n't effective . 
  bild is germany 's fox news / daily mail, 
  there is a time and a place for mercenaries . 
  eastern ukraine in spring 2014 is one of those places during one of those times . 
  the ukrainian military is not able to handle the little green men and western powers are not willing to send in their own troops . 
  ukraine needs to employ these mercenaries , russia has forced this upon them . 
  the first 3 minutes say it all . 
  well they do , but putin 's gov has introduced greater and greater control of the internet , such as shutting down independent news sites , limiting access to foreign media , requiring bloggers with over 3,000 followers to register with the gov , harsh `` internet obscenity laws '' etc. 
  they may be able to get online , but the average joe russkie wo n't be able to access that same crazy / wonderful internet as the average joe westerner . 
  fuck yea , i am so proud that those guys are there !, 
  sure , they have a dark reputation but if there was ever a time and a place for blackwater mercenaries , it 's eastern ukraine in spring 2014 . 
  i mean honestly , russia has ` little green men ' on the ground with sam 's and tanks , i think ukraine has a right to hire top tier western mercenaries in response . 
  edit : alright , saying i 'm proud is a bit too colorful . 
  i say that because i follow a few ukrainian guys on twitter and they 've been tweeting about how much they wish the west would send help . 
  people do n't realize that there is a considerable portion of ukrainians ( eastern and western ; russophone and ukrainophone ) who would actually be happy and ** relieved ** to know that blackwater mercenaries and cia operatives are working in ukraine to counter the russians . 
  well at least it showed that both ukraine and romania are n't gon na let russia win transnistria . 
  especially since the only way russia can get troops to transnistria is via air, 
  so what is he still stuck in transnistria ? 
  because that would be great . 
  those kids are gon na be so weird when they grow up : * limited internet exposure , which will make them * super weird * compared to the rest of their generation * creepy putin camps to make them all juche crazy, 
  you say that because you 're completely sheltered and you do n't realize how chaotic 70 % of the world is and the importance of either 1 ) containing the chaos or 2 ) reducing the chaos . 
  oh , so every single piece of journalism needs to be a vicious attack ? 
  yatseniuk is under tremendous pressure and he 's not a confident , super charismatic political type like obama or merkel ; he 's a behind the scenes technocratic policy maker . 
  since he 's not one to undertake crazy pr stunts like putin to assert his leadership , i think it 's fair that journalists do some investigating to uncover his leadership style . 
  in fact i welcome that , maybe our world would be a better place if we had more introverted , reflective world leaders . 
  okay , you 're kind of an ass . 
  fyi this comment got attacked by a / r/shitamericanssay downvote brigade , so suck my dick because i 'm right . 
  hell yea they were armed with bats and home-made trebuchets . 
  their country was getting the absolute shit raped out of it by extremely corrupt politicians . 
  that 's maybe similar to how i view minnesota and america . 
  i see minnesota as a cozy , safe land tucked into the very heart of the north american continent where my family 's roots have dug deep . 
  i see america as being this awesome juggernaut whose power ( economic , cultural and military ) can be projected to every inch of the earth and whose diverse population is a giant engine of progress ( technological , scientific and social ) . 
  is that kind of what you meant ? 
  i may be an atheist , but somehow i consider the european union to be sacred . 
  i say this because there is something profoundly beautiful and innately good about the european project . 
  to me it represents a step forwards in human evolution , where hundreds of millions of people with distinct ethnic and cultural identities are coming together in the name of peace and progress . 
  it 's hard to explain but i see the eu as being sacred : * in the way that an ancient artifact is sacred * in the way that a space program , dedicated to exploring the heavens , is sacred * in the way that shakespeare 's plays are sacred * and yes , in the way that the american constitution is sacred i also think europeans should starts shifting the way they see the eu flag . 
  they should see the eu flag how americans see the american flag ( yes i know you make fun of it , but it can be truly special sometimes ) . 
  the thing is that loving the eu flag is n't nationalistic or chauvinist , in fact it 's the opposite of these . 
  til i attend the 29th best university in the world , according to the chinese . 
  once you get a scenario where most of the elderly people , middle aged and young people can speak english at a highly proficient level , i think integration will accelerate . 
  and the really young european kids already speak english freakishly well . 
  my oma 's nieces , her daughter and her grand kids came to visit us this past summer . 
  the grandma could speak fairly good english , but with a thick german accent . 
  ( age ~ 65/70 ) her daughter spoke english fluently , but with a slight accent . 
  ( age ~ 45 ) and then two grand kids spoke absolutely flawless english . 
  zero accent . 
  ( ages 12 and 15 ) in 60 years europe is going to be full of people from that last category . 
  if china wants that shit , i bet they could take it . 
  no matter how strong the russian army is , you can not beat the chinese in a terrestrial fight right next to its borders . 
  there 's just so many of them , so many many soldiers they can field . 
  only a maritime power can beat china . 
  and russia is not a maritime power . 
  depends on the state . 
  some states , mine for example , allow you to register at the polling place . 
  you just go up to this table , tell them your name and address and you 're registered . 
  other states require pre-registration which is wrong . 
  a lot of those states are in the south and have large black populations . 
  and they for sure require pre-registration to put up a barrier for black people to vote . 
  the white majorities secretly ( or subconsciously , i 'm not sure ) fear that black people might become too powerful . 
  they 've been trying shit like that down there ever since president grant foolishly ended reconstruction . 
  the worst part is that the poor whites , who make up the base of the southern electorate , are the most racist and supportive of these policy despite the fact that they and black people * have the same interests * i.e. 
  support for the economically disadvantaged . 
  it 's been that way since english rule : the cavaliers bombarded the poor whites with propaganda to turn them against the blacks as a sort of divide and conquer strategy . 
  yea , with you about them believing they are freedom fighters . 
  the other day i heard about some canadian boys of ukrainian descent going to ukraine hoping to help , including to fight if it came to it . 
  they even brought bullet proof vests and small weapons . 
  i thought ( still think ) that they are awesome for going . 
  then i think about young european muslims heading to syria to jihad and i can kind of understand why they would . 
  the difference is that the canadians were going to defend the democratic , anti-corruption , westward looking maidan movement . 
  which in my mind , is very noble . 
  whereas jihad will just breed more violence and destruction . 
  that being said , if there are young arab-french boys who want to fight in syria to establish a jeffersonian democracy , then i support them . 
  it would probably work for 320 million people , but it would probably be extremely expensive to do so . 
  it 's cheaper to have people register themselves . 
  well , the only way we could have fully liberated north korea was to drops nukes in china . 
  american soldiers kept on killing and killing chinese soldiers and more and more keg on reappearing . 
  for every soldier the us killed , 2 chinese soldiers appeared to replace him . 
  edit : the military concluded that atomic warfare was the only way to stop the chinese , president eisenhower could n't bring himself to authorize such an immensely destructive strike . 
  aka ve day . 
  there is also vj day . 
  although probably only britain recognizes that in europe . 
  11 million non-citizen immigrants . 
  7 million additional illegal immigrants .
