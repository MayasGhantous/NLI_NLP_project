congrats guys !, 
  you are lying to yourself if you think the uk is n't a powerful country . 
  you are good at your job , i 'll admit !, 
  this guy is a well known troll on / r/europe by the way . 
  yeah , i get what you are saying . 
  i 'd say that 's just the internet in general maybe ? 
  i agree though . 
  i do n't think that 's true .

  well i do n't think we should be criticizing the french for that , the iraq war was n't really legitimate .

  wow finally  delaware is relevant !, 
  ( i am from delaware ! ), 
  hey why are you being rude, 
  this is very nice , great work !, 
  did someone say america ?!, 
  now it 's time for a game of handegg !, 
  i wish we just could get rid of the dnc and the gop . 
  we need more then two choices . 
   there is nothing which i dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties , each arranged under its leader , and concerting measures in opposition to each other . 
  this , in my humble apprehension , is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our constitution . 
  - john adams, 
  a bit rough around the edges , but i 'd say it 's still a democracy . 
  just needs a fix . 
  the fact that trump got the nomination kind of shows that the vote 's count . 
  what ? 
  the fact that you attack me like that shows your priorities and how you have no argument . 
  very mature of you . 
  and i only brought up the fact that reddit is american because i was saying how you are exposed to americans more . 
  but sure , as long as you make yourself feel superior . 
  you did n't even make an argument to my other points . 
  i think they do too . 
  it 's just the us is western , has a large population , and europe is exposed to us tv and culture more . 
  ( you 're on an american website right now . ), 
  which means it 's easier to see americans making the mistake . 
  what about south america , africa , the rest of north america , and asia ? 
  i think you just have a bias . 
  i doubt it 's just america . 
  source ? 
  surely you ca n't really label 1/2 of a population as dummies just because of a disagreement , can you ? 
  i wish they 'd have remained in the eu too , but it seems very silly . 
  we were in debt way before obama . 
  care to make an argument ? 
  europe messed with the middle east too y' know . 
  if you really think the us is trying to kill civilians you 're not the brightest . 
  * first off you 'd be hearing of much more civilian deaths if we purposefully targeted them . 
  * why would the us waste money ? 
  you realize how much weaponry costs , right ? 
  * if we let isil/isis roam free how many people do you think they 'd kill ? 
  you might be forgetting that the us is n't alone in their drone strikes ... unless you also consider [ canada ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/up-to-27-iraqi-civilians-may-have-been-killed-in-canadian-airstrike-pentagon-document-reveals-1.3213917 ) to be murderers too . 
  and last time i checked europe 's record was n't so great either ... 
  do you have a shorter source/summary or something ? 
  that one is like 30 + minutes . 
  dang you got us , guess we 'll just pull out of syria then !, 
  you do know what checks and balances are right ? 
  even if he get 's elected it 's not like he can do everything he wants . 
  well europe is giving the nsa it 's data so i do n't know how safe you are . 
  a true patriot !, 
  pie is good ( \u25e0 \u203f \u25e0 ), 
  the squirty kind of course !, 
  welp i 'm beat . 
  cuff me boys !, 
  we will meet half way then . 
  atlantic ocean it is !, 
  choose your weapon for duel . 
  fight me irl, 
  more like any progress is blocked by nra/lobbyist . 
  sounds good !, 
  maybe i should start watching got ... 
  thanks !, 
  i 've got a ton of respect for the soldiers in both world wars . 
  must 've been gruesome . 
  sorry i should of clarified , not my picture . 
  i already found it on the sub . 
  i get what you 're saying though !, 
  nice !, 
  that 's great to hear !, 
  how is that title gore ? 
  it 's just the name of the building . 
  also to my knowledge it is n't photoshopped . 
  please checkout / r/evilbuildings for more sinister looking architecture !, 
  good advice !, 
  yes that 's true , but the one 's that voted leave seem to be the more uneducated half , or at least quite old . 
  ( no offense . ), 
  i do get what you 're saying though , there had been a lot of warnings . 
  i get what you 're saying , but should we really wish ill on them just because they 're misinformed ? 
  i seriously doubt 52 % of the uk 's population is stupid . 
  i can at least understand * why * some of them did it . 
  why would you want that ? 
  i know ireland has bad blood with the uk , but there are innocent people there . 
  how would you think they 'd feel ? 
  i do n't like the idea of labeling some one as unintelligent just because you disagree with them politically . 
  what ever the uk votes i will still respect them . 
  yes but it 's not really our decision to make though . 
  he is a well known troll on / r/europe, 
  germany was caught spying on usa and israel and i have n't heard anyone talk about that ...

  well congratulations to you germany , hopefully we can learn from our mistakes .
