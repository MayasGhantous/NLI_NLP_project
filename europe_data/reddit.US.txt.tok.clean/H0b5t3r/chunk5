  i do n't support independence for kosovo but mexican-american war is something very different . 
  how could they not ? 
  both are authoritarian and culturally incompatible with the west . 
  every part of the us was politically aligned with every other point of the us at one point or another . 
  they want jobs causing terror because where they are from all the positions causing terror are filled . 
  in the middle east their is a high supply and a low demand in europe the supply is low and the demand is high . 
  if they cause terror where they are now no one will care . 
  their is no jobs for terrorists where they come from . 
  when will europe learn that these economic migrants want nothing besides to cause terror, 
  they are currently working on starting to genocide the kurds erdogan himself might not be an extremist but he halves the extremists internationally . 
  he allows isis fighters to flow freely through his country and bought oil from isis, 
  i do n't think this because of the coup or their reaction to it or even their dealing with refugees , i think this because of their support of islamic extremism and their policy of genocide to deal with minorities who want independence . 
  we could replace turkey with armenia , georgia , and cyprus so we would n't lose the strategic positioning . 
  if they bomb tourist beaches that 's a big problem . 
  i wish we would join them in this . 
  honestly we should put the same arms embargo on saudi arabia as well . 
  and kick turkey out of nato . 
  we are doing better than i expected , worse than i had hoped ... 
  if you only look at a war trough the lens of civilian deaths you can not judge wether it was a jut war or not, 
  ha , i guess you must really like wilson then , i think he would better learned his foreign policy from theodore roosevelt instead of william jennings bryan . 
  them wanting to become a part of america does n't have anything to do with any of this . 
  we should have done it again and actually taken land . 
  we should have been proactive and invaded mexico again instead of sending people to europe to die . 
  we should have just invaded mexico for their insolence and let the europeans be . 
  it was n't like ww2 where one of the sides had a moral high ground . 
  it is to bad he broke his promise, 
  do n't worry once we liberate you we will sell you some freedom fries !, 
  implied '' / s '', 
  if bush faces trial the us will just invade belgium and free him . 
  pretty sure east asia is the most globalize region of the globe , almost all of them have free trade with almost everyone else . 
  if ( displayingflag = = true ) { iscountry = true ; } / / thanks for the downvotes, 
  maybe not , but he is still representing the turkish state by displaying the flag of turkey . 
  i do n't think we should go out of our way , but russia can generally agree with us after all they are capitalist , secular , and in everything but practice a democracy . 
  i to would rather have global civilization reflect the west but historically russia is part of the west . 
  i think almost anything would be better than chinese based world rule . 
  bush dynasty is still alive ( george p. bush is big in texas ) he just defeated jeb bush , the least popular and most uncool bush alive . 
  clinton screwed over her self . 
  i do n't think he is an idiot or did it to make money , i think he mostly did it for attention and he usually has somewhat circuitous logic so the best way to get attention is to do something huge and unprecedented . 
  for the money comment you said he wasted a ton of money then and i 'm saying he will likely make it back so it is n't much of a concern . 
  trump wants attention . 
  he 's going to get rich ( er ) from all the benefits he gives his companies plus he has said that the republican party has to pay him back for the money he spent . 
  and i think most people would agree trump does n't always think things for the best reasons . 
  i 'd like the us and eu to be generally equal with russia as a friend , iran i can go either way on but china does n't deserve the position they have now, 
  you are one to talk . 
  congress can declare war on a nation who attacks a nato ally then if the president does n't fight the war they can impeach the president for not doing their job . 
  kasich says that trump wants his vo to be in charge of all affairs foreign and domestic, 
  assuming you are dutch based on your name . 
  i 'm not surprised that you do n't view russians as a threat , your people never lived under the soviet union and knew how truly terrible russian rule was for everyone . 
  but russia does pose a threat they repeatedly violate airspace of any western nation they can , they would do it to netherlands to but it is likely to far . 
  it wo n't be to far once they have poland though . 
  yes , most of western europe does n't care if eastern europe is part of russia . 
  perhaps they will care when they border russia . 
  it means multiple nations can free load . 
  it 's more like the countries that do n't want eastern europe to be part of russia meet the contribution or are on there way to doing so would like the other members to help protect eastern europe . 
  just because others are freeloading does n't mean others are n't as well !, 
  but yes the burden does often fall to those in eastern europe to `` pay their share '' when nations like spain , france , and germany should be leading by example and spending 2 %, 
  this is a big surprise ! / s, 
  he would n't be able to run for this seat as part of labour . 
  this is completely wrong , montenegro will not be a part of nato for another eleven days . 
   17 trillion dollars of gdp you mean 16.4 trillion, 
  or you need better european content, 
  the problem with this is that when someone in korea or europe comes up with a good idea for a movie they usually bring it to hollywood . 
  [ next time edit your previous comment faster . 
  what do you mean ? 
  [ the number two song in france right now is by a british artist . 
  ] ( http://www.billboard.com/charts/france-songs ), 
  i ca n't reaaly speak for indian movies but based on western movies that do well in china and chinese movies they believe are good enough to send to the west , you do not want o spend time watching most chinese movies , for example the new transformers movie is considered a masterpiece over there . 
  that 's an interesting sentiment as the user of the english website imdb have [ ranked 8 american tv shows in the top ten ] ( http://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv/ ) and zero from continental europe in the top ten . 
  yes but the independent european films are probably much less good and broadly appealing than the disney film . 
   unrestricted capitalism is quite a bad idea . 
  this is completely true but protectionism just makes capitalism worse . 
  lol . 
  you say i 'm wrong and do n't support it with any evidence at all . 
  even more lol . 
  you say bild sold 12 million , oops thats [ actually 2.5 million ] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/304799/bild-circulation/ ) edit : even more lol . 
  the website is n't measuring circulation , it is measuring most read . 
  uk cultural products include [ the first , second , eighth , and tenth most read newspapers in the world ] ( http://www.trendingtopmost.com/worlds-popular-list-top-10/2017-2018-2019-2020-2021/world/most-read-newspapers-world-best-selling/ ) , [ the first , fourth , eighth , and ninth best selling musicians of all time ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/best-selling-music-artists-of-all-time-2016-9/ ) , [ the second and third best selling albums of this century ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_best-selling_albums_of_the_2000s_ ( century ) ) [ the second , fourth , fifth , sixth , eighth , ninth , and tenth best selling books of all times ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_best-selling_books#more_than_100_million_copies ) , [ the fourth most watched sports league in the world ] ( https://www.sportskeeda.com/slideshow/top-10-most-watched-sports-leagues-world?imgid=76441 ) , [ the third most olympic medals of any nation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/all-time_olympic_games_medal_table#nocs_with_medals ) , a monarch that reigns over roughly 2 % of the worlds population , a language spoken by nearly 20 % of the world population , [ the second most nobel prize winners of any country ] ( http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-30-countries-with-nobel-prize-winners.html ) , and [ the most watched television network in the world . 
  ] ( http://www.worldlistmania.com/most-popular-television-channels-world/ ) so i would say that the british are pretty well promoted in the culture department globally . 
  i know you complained about the another commenter not giving you sources so i made sure to source almost everything . 
  shazam is obviously not a better source than the french music industry because shazam is self selected . 
  finally , `` that is from the seventies , stop living in the past , '' is nonsense when talking about culture , culture builds on itself and the past defines culture . 
  this is like forcing a liquor store in america to buy american beer instead of belgian and irish beer and american wine instead of french and italian wine . 
  i half-expected him to say `` sad ! '', 
  somewhere in there with how badly written it is . 
  i do n't think so because the `` actual '' socialists are polling at 15 %, 
  better than actually being socialist, 
  i wish we could send some f-22s to fly alongside greek f-16s and some b-52s , b-1s , and b-2s to violate turkish airspace . 
  i 'm guessing they ca n't but it is n't a point against trump . 
  under trump coal has shrunk though and green energy has grown . 
  killing foreign civilians is n't the benchmark of a bad leader . 
  plus if you want to talk about starvation , maduro might not be the best person to [ say does n't ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/venezuela-weight-loss-average-19lb-pounds-food-shortages-economic-crisis-a7595081.html ) [ cause starvation ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/20/venezuelas-crisis-cause-its-people-to-cut-meals-and-lose-weight.html ) plus [ xi jinping ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/23/asia/china-organ-harvesting/ ) , and [ china in general ] ( https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/china-and-tibet ) , are n't exactly well known for good leadership . 
  these are n't major papers , if you went to a small town in france what would you expect to cover more international politics or local news ? 
  i bet you fly the american flag upside down to be edgy as well , trump may be bad but he is nowhere near the level of maduro , orban , erdogan , lukashenko , xi , duterte , or any number of other world leaders . 
  edit : fixed the leader of china, 
  i can hear myself speak and i understand that you may think turks are on the same level as everyone else and i understand why you think that , even people sometimes overestimate themselves , but you must realize you will never be on the same level as western europe or eastern asia . 
  some americans are stupid and fat , all turks lack civilization . 
  you can bring fitness to an overweight person you can not bring culture to the illiterate . 
  is it racist if it is true ? 
  says the turk ... 
  an independent catalonia would have an economy about as good as venezuela .
