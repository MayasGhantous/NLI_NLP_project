very interesting . 
  as a conservative catholic american i feel pretty out of place here haha, 
  ahh thank you . 
  i always believed they were the same thing but i looked it up and found they were different . 
  so europeans and americans both love their countries , but only americans act like its the best country in the world, 
  interesting . 
  in america it 's considered a very positive trait . 
  why would it be considered bad to love your country ? 
  i 've heard that nationalism has a negative connotation in europe ? 
  is this true ? 
  as an american i 'm genuinely curious, 
  thanks for all the info til, 
  i never would 've guessed that the uk has strict libel laws . 
  are n't you guys known for your wide variety of ridiculous tabloids ? 
   in closing , bear in mind ; call me david is an unofficial biography written by one of david cameron 's long-time political rivals and based heavily on undocumented evidence . 
  it is to be taken with a grain of salt . 
  this is how they end it . 
  pretty obviously a smear campaign, 
  true and bavaria is low , especially when compared to the rest of germany, 
  the grocery store managers where i worked made about $ 110,000 which comes out to about # 70k, 
  catholic ? 
  that explains portugal and poland , but italy seems to a bit of a catholic anomaly, 
  true the eastern european immigrants i know still rave about the us . 
  they seem to become pretty successful as well in my experience, 
  i think , generally , immigrants assimilate well to america because pretty much everyone is an immigrant if they trace their family tree back far enough, 
  it 's useful for smaller countries i really know nothing about , but i would n't use it for any relatively major powers, 
  jesus christ this reads like a dark onion title, 
  you have a party called holy ghost ? 
  that 's awesome =d, 
  * hey kids ... lem me rustle your jimmies * ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i actually get to see him when he comes to speak at my school in a few weeks . 
  should be quite the show, 
  pshhh that just gets the adrenaline pumping . 
  like a real life call of duty game !, 
  free college and a chance to travel the world . 
  what 's not to like ? 
  it 's all good though , trump is gon na build a wall, 
   who joins the army these days you do n't know much about america friend . 
  the military is * faaar * from struggling with recruits . 
  with our patriotism and love of guns , there will always been plenty of recruits , poor or otherwise . 
  many of my friends went to the military for various reasons and i went to a private high school in upper-middle class suburbia, 
  it sucks for any politician , it 's basically a lose-lose situation . 
  you 're either a heartless babykiller or letting your country be overrun be foreigners who take all the welfare and free housing, 
  awesome looks like i will be headed there then . 
  banking is something i would definitely be interested in, 
  either university of mannheim of otto beisham school of management , they are my two options . 
  i have n't decided on a major yet , though i 'm leaning towards finance, 
   business in mannheim i 'm a business major learning german and have to study abroad in the near future . 
  university of mannheim and otto beisham school of management are my two options . 
  is mannheim the best choice you think ? 
  this is really concerning because i will be studying abroad in germany in about a year or two . 
  can anyone confirm or deny that german universities are actually like this ? 
  i realize that i 'm not ignorant , but if you say 2 billion people are cricket fans , 90 % of that is still people from india and pakistan . 
  i could show you a ton of examples of american football leagues across europe and asia but that does n't change that 90 % of american football fans live in america, 
  / u/hlpe is taking about the geographic reach that the sport encompasses , not the number of fans that the sport has . 
  cricket has much more fans , but is mostly confined to one area on the globe compared to the less popular baseball which is played regularly on 3 continents, 
  we only need full body armor to play football because we would literally die if we played our sport with no protection . 
  we do n't have pads because our men are weaker , we need them because our men would beat each other to death without pads, 
   when i went to the bar at 14 i got all the beer i wanted . 
  i 'm 18 and am currently buying a fake id to go to bars near my college :(, 
  join us and bring some freedom ^ tm to the terrorists !, 
  nothing i lean closer to redneck than progressive myself . 
  in my experience redneck is n't a negative word - i have a lot of friends who are self proclaimed rednecks and view the term with pride, 
  yep !, 
  [ it just takes a bit more work . 
  ] ( https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100117150719aapzyly ) people generally hunt large animals deer , boar , or elk with rifles and use shotguns to hunt small , quick animals like duck , pheasant , and rabbits . 
  the spread shot really helps when trying to aim on a fast little target while a powerful accurate rifle helps to down a large animal with a single shot, 
  haha man i was just trying to find a reddit-safe word to describe the kind of people he is looking for . 
  i myself vote republican and would probably self identify as redneck . 
  i just meant progressive in this sense as more similar to a european person . 
  i also think you would find many `` rednecks '' or `` gangstas '' would be proud to be called such titles , although that might be a bigger problem as they are sort of getting caught in the cycle of poverty through labeling, 
  yep !, 
  i believe a shotgun is defined by the way it does n't fire a single bullet but rather sprays [ dozens of tiny pellets ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=shotgun+pellets&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=si&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoamovchmihstwoo7axwivybesch1y9gri&amp;biw=375&amp;bih=559#imgrc=mt3vqhx5a2-i4m%3a ) in a wide range . 
  that 's why it is used in combat to clear smal rooms or recreationally to shoot moving objects . 
  it would be near impossible to shoot a moving clay target or a duck with a single bullet . 
  [ heres a little blurb about shotgun use and history ] ( http://science.howstuffworks.com/shotgun.htm ), 
  eh i just saw the question and commented hoping to spark some discussion ( which it seems i did ) . 
  if people feel like my comment does n't belong they are free to downvote it to the bottom, 
  nah you can go [ skeet shooting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs5me5uofam ) or [ just use it for hunting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uojsgpfzdgk ) . 
  and of course some people keep sawed-off shotguns underneath the counter if they work in a really bad part of town . 
  they are a lot fun to shoot , they kick like a mule, 
  well good luck to you man hope it works out . 
  feel free to pm if you got any questions, 
  the south gets a lot of shit on reddit ( and some of it deservedly so ) but it 's got its perks . 
  the weather is great , the food unbeatable , and most people are nice . 
  southern hospitality is a very real thing . 
  plus college football games are an * incredible * experience down south , try to go to a gamecock game, 
  out of curiosity why are you choosing south carolina to move to ? 
  honestly it all depends on who you hang out with . 
  anywhere you go you can find rednecks and progressives , the latter in large cities especially . 
  i 'm in columbia and there are a lot of redneck types who are all about guns and hunting etc. 
  but i 've heard charleston is much more metropolitan, 
  i 'm from jacksonville , florida but i 'm going to school in south carolina, 
  we are gun nuts . 
  i just moved into college and my roommate is complaining about not being able to bring his shotguns . 
  another friend and i are planning go shooting ar-15s over winter break . 
  everyone i know owns a pistol , and i mean nearly everyone disclaimer : i live in the south, 
  people treat bike lanes like extensions of the road . 
  no seriously , if you come here do n't use the bike lanes you will get run over, 
  nothing about education or arrogance .
