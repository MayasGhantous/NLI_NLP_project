  recently came back from vacation in florence , ca n't say enough good things about the city !, 
  everywhere you turn there is something beautiful - whether it be the architecture , nature , or just the people, 
  very interesting article . 
  i may be studying there in a few years and it looks fantastic !, 
  which is only another plus in my book ^ but ^ i 'm ^ in ^ the ^ minority, 
   a hole lot of money sounds like you need to plug that hole quick, 
  funny , most americans feel that exact same way about europe . 
  kinda like the opposite of ` the grass is always greener ', 
  rich people from all over the world fly to america to get treatment here . 
  people have always made fun of america for having expensive healthcare and that 's all well and good but you ca n't say that it 's low quality, 
  or rubio who is cuban and speaks spanish fluently, 
  abortion is * much * more hotly debated issue though , [ check out this gallup poll from one month ago ] ( http://www.lifenews.com/2015/05/29/gallup-poll-54-of-americans-want-all-or-most-abortions-made-illegal/ ) . 
  also , while the majority of young people support gay marriage young americans are pretty evenly split about abortion, 
  i 'm from florida and most the cubans here vote republican . 
  i do n't think hispanics are as set in stone to vote left as say blacks or gays . 
  there will probably be a battle over hispanics in politics for the next few decades, 
   expect to see a libertarian/socialist divide in the us replacing the old progress vs. jeezus one . 
  i hope so . 
  most of my young republican friends lean right economically but do n't care much for social issues . 
  the party will shift as well as more and more of these type of people reach voting age, 
  exactly . 
  i guarantee you the republicans wo n't be anti-gay marriage and anti-marijuana in 20 years or even 10 years, 
  the whole texas turning blue thing is overplayed . 
  is it ? 
  yes but slowly . 
  it wo n't be turning democrat anytime soon , maybe in 20 years, 
  as a republican i agree this is good for us . 
  i know a lot of people that lean right economically but are wary about voting republican because of social issues . 
  maybe this will allow us to capture some of those voters, 
  our healthcare is functional and very good . 
  it 's just * very * expensive without insurance, 
  what is the difference between `` new-con '' and conservative or are they just the same thing ? 
   americans wish they had stuff like healthcare and public education many of us do n't . 
  most redditors do , sure , but the average american is [ about 50/50 with the anti-government healthcare side having a slight edge . 
  ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/4708/healthcare-system.aspx ) from my personal experience as well , i 've almost never heard people say they desire the europe system , though i do n't know stems from a dislike of the european system of ignorance of it, 
  the only people i know who smoke tend to work in the service industry . 
  i find a lot of waitresses and cashiers smoke , but they may be doing that only to take advantage of the extra smoke breaks, 
  talking to people on the internet and realizing that there are many different interpretations of leviticus and the bible . 
  and that it 's pointless to put so much energy into controlling others . 
  live and let live, 
  can confirm . 
  i was opposed to gay marriage for many years, 
  that ... does n't seem fair, 
  wait you 're allowed to just ban a party you do n't agree with ? 
  he 's an embarrassment to the other americans on here honestly . 
  i cringe whenever i see his name in a comment thread . 
  he says crazy stuff like this :  this is what 's happening in scandinavia and finland ; the young generations are brainwashed by american media and reality tv and charlatan cults like the danish liberal alliance and are forcing austerity even though there is no pressing need for it . 
  he calls freemarketers `` teabaggers '' in the same thread and believes they should n't be allowed to vote because it `` threatens the safety net '' . 
  i sincerely hope he is a troll, 
  yeah i just came back from europe , the jaywalking is ridiculous there , especially considering how crazy driving is !, 
  i 'm surprised i did n't witness half a dozen roadkills in rome alone, 
  sounds like you would like america in that regard . 
  we have a society focused on personal success and do n't have much safety nets . 
  the country is perfect for individuals starting businesses and becoming wealthy and if they fail , they are fucked . 
  i personally love it as well and i would n't have it any other way, 
  some catholic schools have nuns that will hit your hands with rulers or spank you with a paddle of you do something real bad . 
  mine was n't like that , but it 's not a big deal . 
  parents choose to send their kids to those schools . 
  it would only be an issue of public schools did it which i do n't believe they do, 
  oh no i agree with you . 
  i just did n't want to say that a good portion of reddit is stupid hateful atheists who love to hate religion cuz i 'd be downvoted to oblivion, 
  yeah i agree . 
  i 'm still annoyed though when people paint every priest to be a child rapist and the pope to be some evil greedy mastermind, 
  i read once that to foreigner , yank means an american . 
  to americans , yank means a northerner . 
  to northerners , yank means someone from vermont . 
  to someone in vermont it means someone who eats pie . 
  i 'm from florida though so i ca n't confirm that last bit, 
  eh i 'm catholic myself but you ca n't pretend that the church has some views that progressives would be * very * opposed to . 
  that and the whole molestation thing, 
  invest in vatican real estate quick !, 
   portugal  5 - bullying is there something you 're not telling us portugal ? 
  he 's the one i was thinking of . 
  did n't know he was unique in that respect sorry, 
  a user-created comic that uses balls with nations ' flags to represent countries and make fun of international relations and country stereotypes . 
  [ link to subreddit here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/ ), 
  technically they do n't have to be born and raised in the basque country . 
  they can be the children of basque parents overseas iirc, 
  we always have . 
  the man who proposed the big bang theory , [ georges lemaitre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georges_lema%c3%aetre ) , was actually a catholic priest, 
  nah we do n't it 's just a very common misconception . 
  we do n't worship anyone besides jesus/god . 
  we pray to mary and the saints for intercession . 
  basically , we ask mary to ask god to help us . 
  and we do n't worship the statues , they are just a way to visualize saints and help focus prayer, 
  all the 1/252nd irish people in the u.s. certainly contribute to that reputation !, 
   i 'm praying that it passes interesting use of words haha but i 'll praying too friend, 
  that interesting i 've never heard that before . 
  but many of the others ' contributions still stand, 
  it is worth noting that the father of genetics , gregor mendel , was an augustinian friar and georges lemaitre , the man who first proposed the big bang theory , was a catholic priest . 
  issac newton was [ himself a christian theologian . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isaac_newton#religious_views ) johannes kepler and francis bacon were both christian , while rene descartes was catholic . 
  if you really think that religion has impeded science you should check out [ this article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_christian_thinkers_in_science ), 
  you could argue they are n't enacted in democrat states because illegal immigrants tend to vote democrat, 
  i agree with you , but people here say requiring an i.d. 
  to vote is racist because some people ca n't afford a $ 25 i.d. 
  and blacks are most likely to be pooor, 
  it 's always been easy to get votes by claiming to be `` anti-poverty '' or `` for the poor '' but in charge of a city or a government is so much more complex than that . 
  you ca n't just get in office and start handing out millions of dollars to poor people, 
  it 's always been easy to get votes by claiming to be `` anti-poverty '' or `` for the poor '' but in charge of a city or a government is so much more complex than that .
