  you ca n't just get in office and start handing out millions of dollars to poor people, 
  it 's probably better down south . 
  in northern florida ( jacksonville ) it 's pretty bad, 
  it really depends on what part of the nation . 
  i 'm from florida and the public schools suck . 
  i went to a private school and our advanced placement tests were scored 1-5 ( 3 or above being a passing grade ) and were curved between the public and private schools . 
  the joke was that you could score 3 just for showing up because the public school kids brought the average down so much . 
  that said i would want * all * schools to be privatized , there is room for both . 
  the poor need education too, 
   it does n't matter how iraqi 's feel that 's all i needed to hear , thank you your opinion has been duly noted, 
  but it 's never as cut and dry as you state . 
  most of europe was against our invasion of iraq , yet many iraqi citizens [ hailed us our saviors ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35x9sp/us_troops_strolling_through_romania/cr8xf3t ) . 
  the western world and much of the u.s. was opposed the vietnam war yet many vietnamese people i meet today despise the communist regime and are glad america tried to intervene . 
  there are two sides to every story my friend, 
   drink a soda can like twice a week why the username then ? 
  yeah now that school is over i do n't need caffiene to keep me on schedule as much so i 'm gon na try and stop . 
  diet soda my friend . 
  my insides are all fucked up but at least i 'm skinny ( ish ), 
  it 's what everyone wheres here in florida and i see it a lot in south carolina and alabama as well . 
  must be a southern thing, 
  it 's extremely unhealthy i know , but believe me it 's an abnormal amount over here too . 
  i do n't like coffee so i drink soda to wake up in the mornings and to stay up at night, 
  you have to look at it from the perspective of an iraqi citizen did many iraqi civilians die ? 
  yes . 
  but you have to understand that saddam hussein was a * horrible * man and did despicable things to his own citizens . 
  i mean [ check out ] ( http://civilliberty.about.com/od/internationalhumanrights/p/saddam_hussein.htm ) some of the [ shit he did ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/wnt/iraqcoverage/story?id=2761722 ) . 
  sure war was costly , but my iraqi born family viewed it as a necessary evil to dethrone a sadistic tyrant . 
  also , civilians died in the war because of saddam . 
  he would tie civilians to buildings and important military bases just to increase the death toll and make americans look bad . 
  [ he even mustard gassed his own people !, 
  ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/middle_east/02/iraq_events/html/chemical_warfare.stm ) edit : [ another source ] ( http://wais.stanford.edu/iraq/iraq_deathsundersaddamhussein42503.html ) saying that there were among `` 600,00 civilian executions in iraq '' , there was `` an average of 70 to 125 civilian deaths every day under saddam '' . 
  he also killed 100,000 kurdish iraqis as well, 
  wtf . 
  the pepsi logo looks like its a girdle preventing all the fat from spilling out of the bottle, 
  wow i do n't think we even have 2.5 liters !, 
  romania sounds like a pretty sweet place, 
  watch out it may be contagious . 
  save yourself before it 's too late !, 
  sorry i do n't speak foreign languages u fukkin commie, 
  oh yeah [ chubbies ] ( http://imgur.com/vqggbku ) are all the rage for young men . 
  can confirm : jacksonville is basically southern georgia . 
  in florida , the further south you go the more northern it gets, 
  and we would 've gotten away with it too if it wa n't for you meddling unionists !, 
  they do n't sell sodas in 2 liters in europe !, 
  i do n't know if i could survive over there , i drink a 2 liter everyday, 
  where i 'm from in the south , it is really popular to where `` preppy '' pink polos and bright colors like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/zb3mzpg ) or [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/lillypulitzer/status/598626537374638080 ), 
  i get a hardon watching europeans worship our military . 
  is there something wrong with me doc ? 
  edit : apparently a / s tag was needed, 
   we fucked around with `` hearts and minds '' it worked to some degree at least . 
  my family is iraqi and they are all huge fans of the u.s. invasion . 
  think it was the best thing the u.s. ever did, 
  and now people get pissed off when we try and act like an international guard dog . 
  make up your minds people !, 
  progressive for his position . 
  fish got ta swim , popes got ta pope, 
  i 'm considering taking german in college for my international business degree . 
  would you recommend it ? 
  are there any advantages to it ? 
  i mean it looks really bad obviously but there must be some sort of reason or logic to the law ? 
  america had yet to become a superpower . 
  we needed * some * recompense for the aid . 
  but it 's not like we were war profiteers and we were n't selling weapons to the nazis either . 
  it was a mutual benefitting program, 
  [ cash and carry ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cash_and_carry_ ( world_war_ii ) . 
  we gave tons of aid to britain in 1939 on . 
  here is an excerpt for you : `` the purpose of this policy was to maintain neutrality between the united states and european countries while giving aid to britain by exploiting the fact that germany had no funds and could not reliably ship across the british-controlled atlantic . 
  various policies , such as the neutrality acts of 1935 , 1936 , and 1937 , forbade selling implements of war or lending money to belligerent countries under any terms . 
  the u.s. economy was rebounding at this time , following the great depression , but there was still a need for industrial manufacturing jobs . 
  the cash and carry program helped to solve this issue and in turn great britain benefited from the purchase of arms and other goods . 
  ** this program also prevented us businesses interests backing the success or failure of any warring nation . 
  because of the conclusion of the nye committee , which asserted that united states involvement in world war i was driven by private interests from arms manufacturers , many americans believed that investment in a belligerent would eventually lead to american participation in war . 
  ** u.s. shipping interests were forbidden from entering into conflict zones and us passengers traveling on foreign ships did so at their own risk '', 
  i 'm not saying we were glorious saviors of europe or anything , i 'm just trying to dispel the belief that prior to pearl harbor we were war profiteers , which is false, 
  people often ask me what it means to be an american . 
  i tell 'em it 's triumph . 
  triumph when we nuke our enemies . 
  triumph when when peer down from the moon and laugh heartily at russia . 
  triumph when we depose one dictator after another . 
  triumph when we break into the homes of terrorist kingpins on the other side of earth and shoot them in the face . 
  triumph when we use flying robots to bomb other terrorists in afghanistan , and other nuclear robots to explore mars . 
  triumph when we free europe from nazis . 
  but it 's not just the the big things , see ? 
  it 's the way i can set up lawn chairs at my friends house on the texas rio grande and share a toast to freedom while watching mexicans charge into gunfire to enter my country . 
  it 's the way an italian cabbie sits up straight and floors the gas when he hears my accent . 
  it 's seeing the wide eyes and bead of sweat running down the forehead of a german customs agent when he opens my passport . 
  it 's the way a french waiter hangs his head when i refuse the wine and ask for coke instead , in english knowing full well he understands me ( and that they have it ) . 
  the way an aussie blushes and leans into the urinal next to me in the bathroom , or the scowl that meets my smirk when i tip an english waiter in us dollars covered with washington 's face . 
  the way small mobs of canadian school children follow me from a distance to see what a free man looks like , or how heads timidly rise and women gather when my accent stops the music in the clubs of amsterdam . 
  every bit of it , triumph . 
  that 's what it means to be an american . 
  the u.s. cared a lot . 
  they donated tons of money and weapons to britain and the people at home were firmly against the axis , but it was n't until the pearl harbor attacks that we had a justification to join the war . 
  entering the greatest war of the century is a big decision and we could n't just enter because `` it was the right thing to basically , we supported the allies with aid and ammo until we had a concrete justification to put troops on the ground, 
   why a young or poor person outside of the south east would think conservatives are in their interest is beyond me . 
  they would n't . 
  but young poor people outside the south east do n't make up a majority of the country . 
  the `` rich people , old people , and business people '' make up a large proportion of the country . 
  those people are in different situations and therefore have different views and vote differently . 
  how is it so hard to fathom that some people agree with the conservative policies,
