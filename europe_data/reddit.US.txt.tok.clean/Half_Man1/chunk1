well , they are dangerous ... 
  no escape ... 
  this makes me so disappointed ... 
  let 's not use that phrase mate . 
  would n't that violate their neutrality ? 
  i feel like we were just starting to make up for the bush years ... and now ... * this * ... no wonder you guys make fun of americans so often . 
  they got called deplorable . 
  and racist . 
  and homophobic . 
  and sexist . 
  but some of them are . 
  that 's the frustrating part . 
  like its great to say that we need to listen to them , but when you 've got people who suggest literally banning all muslims from entering the country - it is appropriate to call a spade a spade and say that its islamophobic . 
  you tried too hard here man . 
  a simple [ wrong ] ( https://youtu.be/3be95qqktc0 ) would suffice . 
  ** you got [ one old ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexican%e2%80%93american_war ) grandad **, 
  man on the moon . 
  not debatable . 
  milo ? 
  is that you ? 
  #why do n't you respond to my tweets anymore brother ? 
  nah , you 'd be surprised how many trump supporters think fox has `` sold out to the satanic liberals '' . 
  there 's always [ these fond memories ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9twur0jcavk ) though . 
  let 's break a streak boys !!, 
  wooo !, 
  how did you get upvoted so much ? 
  we both know that europe would n't find such a breakdown anymore amusing than we in america found brexit . 
  at least you do n't live here for it . 
  i 'm starting to think of [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/gnp8nfrb4g4?t=2m7s ) every-time i hear that now . 
  please let the memory of trump fade faster . 
  ** butt out of this birdless mexico **, 
  goddammit there 's no escape from this shit is there . 
  `` we 'll be closer to the americas '' * oh great ... *, 
  whoa low blow . 
  it was a joke . 
  a lot of youngsters do n't even realize how tight this was . 
  everyone who lived through it - of course they know . 
  how about u.s.e ? 
  watch out , you might cut yourself on that edge . 
   which is more evidence that you are full of shit and have an intent of misinformation . 
  for not buying you 're arguments that * all charities * are * bad * ? 
  tell me i 'm misreading you here , please . 
   that hillary is a criminal for occulting information , not necessarily for the content of her emails . 
  once again , there is no evidence of this . 
  you 're theorizing here . 
  you say i 'm assuming the allegations are untrue - yeah , because it 's innocence until proven guilty . 
  and there 's nothing available , to the public at least , that suggest she 's guilty of what you 're describing . 
   they have all been rigged oh , got it . 
  illuminati , media , bias , got it . 
  i guess they do n't believe in the peaceful transition of power where you 're from then . 
   this means what exactly ? 
  the donald trump does n't like the media ? 
  i would n't blame him since clinton have been sending thugs posing as journalists to fuck shit up at his rallies , in fact secret services had to protect him today in nevada ... 
  this is hilarious . 
  this is exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  already the trump brigade has spun this into utter lunacy . 
  you know what happened - a republican protester went to a rally in nevada with a sign that said `` republicans against trump '' he holds it up , gets attacked - trump eggs on the people there - someone shouts ` gun ! ', 
  and now you 've got a free for all on this innocent man . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/trump-protester-i-was-beaten-for-holding-a-republicans-against-trump-sign ) the fact that you 're so quick to rush to spew this misinformation before even knowing what happened is ridiculous . 
  people have attacked journalists - shouted about how jews run america . 
  literally called journalists l\u00fcgenpresse . 
  and you 're * telling me * that that 's not fascism . 
  wow . 
  just wow . 
  ah , so when all else fails , the go to is condescension . 
  you know what changed ? 
  huma abedin 's emails became part of it . 
  that 's it . 
  damn that makes me think . 
  that could 've decided the florida vote easily . 
  which in turn determined the course of world politics for decades to come . 
  crazy , huh ? 
  you realize very little has changed in the investigation since the few months that they 've dropped it , right ? 
  you 're assuming there 's wrongdoing , but if there is n't , nothing will happen . 
  it 's quite foolish to just assume things will go your way . 
  what does it mean ? 
  i 'm sorry , but the first part of your comment reads like a joke . 
  i 'm not going to agree with you that charities are * bad things * . 
   also your criticism of comey is a hypothetical potentiality ` coulda/shoulda/woulda ' , and also includes a statement without evidence , not even ` fake ' evidence : i did n't go into specifics - but the thing that fbi director comey was talking about was more related to the anthony wiener investigation . 
  anthony wiener ( an unfortunately named disgraced politician whose been caught up in a sexting scandal ) has a wife , huma abedin , who has been a clinton aide for years now . 
  because her emails are under investigation , some clinton foundation emails are also under-so due to their connection to huma . 
  but comey mentions none of that in his letter . 
  he mentions very little at all in his letter . 
  just that the investigation has been resumed . 
  i do n't have time atm to get bogged down in a discussion on the emails , but the fbi has already thoroughly investigated months ago and nothing came of it then . 
  since then her foundations been hacked numerous time and those emails have been made public . 
  and still nothing . 
  donald trump has said that he might not accept this years election results . 
  donald trump has threatened to jail his political opponent . 
  donald trump has been attacking the media for being ` dishonest ' and ` rigged ' since day one . 
  on donald trump 's campaign trail , the members of the media have needed their own separate security detail . 
  if none of that sounds fascist to you , i do n't know what will . 
  clinton foundation has been releasing its records , unlike trump , and they 're rated better than the american red cross . 
  unless they murder somebody in the next two days , that 's not gon na sink her . 
  gon na disagree on that one . 
  wonder what the plot would be ... 
  [ the 2000 presidential election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election,_2000 ) bush jr. first turn at the presidency was also the second time in american history where a president won the election without the popular vote - with al gore taking 48.4 % to bush 's 47.9 % , and bush only winning the presidency by two electoral college votes . 
  tack on the united states supreme court telling florida to stop it 's * legally * required recount of their vote , which could 've redecided the election , and you have a potentially very different looking past decade for american politics . 
  it 's unlikely gore would 've involved us in the middle east as heavily , and considering his ardent activism on climate change , our country - and perhaps the world , would 've had a bigger head start in tackling that ongoing crisis . 
  lots of young people today in america do n't realize how important this was .
