   of equal gdp  larger gdp per capita of course the map does n't account for population . 
  it accounts for gdp . 
  just what it says on the tin , man . 
   before being removed from office . 
  he 's the only president to step down actually . 
  though yeah , he probably did so to avoid impeachment and all that jazz . 
  `` i am not a crook '', 
  you 're reminding me of a conversation i had with a guy in paris . 
  he asked me what i thought about pence . 
  i then tried to explain that he wanted federally funded conversion therapy . 
  he understood that pence was building gay hospitals . 
  there was a lot of strange pantomiming going on as well . 
  i 'm sure ukraine and belarus are very comforted by that . 
  go to sleep . 
  there 's no explaining stupid , my friend . 
   i love it when americans act like they know anything about europe hey !, 
  i know some things about europe !, 
  i 've actually lived here for a while and know at least three irish drinking songs . 
  right wing americans on the other hand ... 
  i 've met a few people who think that paris is overrated . 
  especially people who are n't into museums . 
  i started to feel this after only a couple of hours at the louvre ( with a busted knee from drinking too much the night before ) . 
  you can only see so many priceless historical paintings before you start to lose interest . 
  personally , i 'm more of a fan of the smaller cities . 
  loved strasbourg and nancy . 
  he also thinks the orlando shooting was faked . 
  fuck alex jones . 
  damn , i got soooo pissed with my parents when they talked to me about watching out for terrorists while i 'm abroad . 
  terrorists attacks are actually way less threatening in terms of likelihood than straight up getting mugged , which was more likely to happen in the states anyway , and i still never worried then , i was n't gon na worry now . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , letting fear of terrorism govern your life ( and your travel plans ) is letting the terrorists win . 
  he 's appointing judges that will give him the execution . 
  and trump thinks he should be tried and executed . 
  this just makes it more readily apparent that the alt-right is in bed with putin . 
  the administration will try to spin it as `` making friends '' while putin continues to make threatening moves towards eastern europe , this time , sanction free . 
  i have zero faith in anything wikileaks says it will release after all the blabbering they did about insane dnc leaks that never came . 
  i 'm looking at the map still ... 
  are we saying then that all the non eu countries when added together with eu ( including the uk ) still do n't beat us 's gdp ??? 
  edit : sorry guys , just found it a bit hard to believe . 
  i expected europe 's gdp to be higher . 
  read that as  makes them more * british *, 
  yeah , that part i know first hand . 
  you realize california 's gdp is lower than the constituent countries you put in , right ? 
  wait , so is this saying that we nearly covered the entirety of europe with our gdp , or are there states repeating that i do n't notice ? 
  and what does that gray region in russia represent ? 
  you guys want to leave the eu , there 's a few nut-heads in texas who want to leave the us , it 's only reasonable . 
  cogratulations , the uk is officially the texas of europe . 
  [ and you know what they say ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyfsdj1j5vw ), 
  and that 's supposed to make it * better * ? 
  i mean , people left before trump , they 'll probably leave more with trump . 
  the fear is , that with trump 's isolationist and anti-intellectual policies , the chances at salvages a career in the long term for scientists and engineers in america is going to go down . 
  i mean , just look at solar power . 
  trump 's new energy policy does n't breath a word on it , even though its a huge deal in the energy industry . 
  hehe , i know a bunch of people who definitely are considering this way more seriously during their study abroad trips now that trump is in office . 
  problem with france in particular picking up on the scientists is the language barrier , though i admit i do n't know how significant that is in the workplaces in france . 
  sure , most americans will probably stay , but for all those who were already considering moving abroad , europe is indeed looking very appetizing right now . 
  believe me , the eu is ripping us bigly on representation . 
  it 's deplorable . 
  the argument back then was if you can be conscripted , you can vote . 
  well , it 's about the right to marry someone you love not just someone of the opposite sex . 
  that statement ... could be misinterpreted . 
  i 've literally had someone tell me in the states that gay men already had the same rights as straight men because both had the right to marry women . 
  it 's ... a silly line of thought . 
  [ wrong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celtic_nations ), 
  i mean , i was hoping for mexico to be state 51 , but those plans will need to be ... stalled ... 
  i do n't think so , at least from what i 've seen , most people do n't really view it as a great idea for scotland to leave . 
  obviously a horrible idea for the uk to leave but yeah . 
  would n't the irish just take it if that were to happen ? 
  make the celtic union a thing . 
  not intentionally ... 
  i 'm quite partial to sa but you may be on to something given recent events . 
  sometimes it looks like everyone from the anglosphere expects the eu to crash and burn and the euro to fail and russia to takeover . 
  i do n't understand . 
  when you look past all the wannabe economist who just jerk themselves off at the notion of the euro failing - and actually look at the struggles the eu has gone through successfully , it makes me very doubtful we ** wo n't ** see the eu in the next 25 years . 
  oh yeah , who 'd they pick when it was our turn ? 
   excluding both coasts , the rest of the us is still quite racist . 
  that is a gross oversimplification of the demographics of racism , and i have no idea who calls the midwest `` bad lands '' , or why you seem to think they are more racist for whatever reason , then people on the coasts . 
  there is a distinctly bigger problem with racism in ** rural ** areas and ** ghettos ** , but those can exist ** anywhere ** in america and are n't confined to the coast or the midwest . 
  i 'm not exactly sure why this is on r/europe . 
  i thought it was a common known fact that the irish and italians went through the ringer when they got here . 
  i would n't exactly call that `` anti-european '' . 
  more just anti-immigrant . 
  i thought the us had gotten past the anti-immigrant sentiments though ... but , you all know how that 's going . 
  that 's unfortunately how things tend to end up in america . 
  i was n't trying to say he was saying that . 
  but `` locked into oblivion '' did make me imagine that pretty quickly . 
  for starters i want to say i agree with you almost entirely , except for this -  he should stay in prison and locked into oblivion , eventually being forgotten forever . 
  this is what always troubles me with criminal justice . 
  if we as a society are going to say that one person is so far gone , so inhuman , that they should essentially be locked away and forgotten forever , than honestly , what 's the difference between putting a bullet in the back of his head ? 
  i honestly do n't want any people , even monstrous shit stains like the one you 're talking about , to be left in solitary confinement and left for days on end . 
  it 's tantamount to torture . 
  and if we 're going to rightfully call these people monsters , we should n't be monsters back . 
  lock him in a cell , and show him the error of his ways . 
  somehow . 
  and then , if need be , leave him in prison , let him perform at least some small menial task that will be of service to society , until such time may come that the public decides he can see the light of day again without bars in the way . 
  that was a very cowardly attempt at a rebuttal , and you should know that . 
  you added nothing of substance , and did n't even put your own opinion up for scrutiny . 
  all the dank maymays, 
  would n't this be more fitting with a cat ? 
  where france ? 
  france is not a very precise location .
