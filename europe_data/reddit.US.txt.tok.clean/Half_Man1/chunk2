  kinda strange to think how much different things could 've been . 
  i did n't realize john podesta was on the ballot , or that art taste was a domestic crisis . 
  should n't it read vnionem evropaeam ? 
  or does `` eurofederalist '' also entail a name change ? 
  would n't it just be fe ? 
  oh , come on , i 'm just poking fun , i thought germans were supposed to be funny . 
   you 're spiraling in many directions spare me the complaints , you 're doing the exact same thing . 
  nothing illegal about charities with your name on it accepting international donors . 
  they 're only doing it now so there 's no appearance of a conflict of interest . 
  indictment for what ? 
  setting up an email server that was * legal * initially ? 
  or for someone else 's emails getting out there because their husband sexted someone ? 
   again i dont know where you guys are going with the `` the people who know most about hillary hate her guts '' angle speaking of spiraling into many directions ... ? 
  do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  clinton 's had tons of support from her allies for ages . 
  [ can the same be said of trump ? 
  ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all )  the gay rights thing is largely regarding the fact that he 'd be better about letting in a religion which killed many gays in florida i imagine . 
  that 's a joke of a defense and you know it . 
  what 's more his party has been diametrically opposed to any form of gun control ** which would have prevented those deaths since the perpetrator had been on the terrorist watch list ** . 
  besides , the shooter was born in america . 
  nothing about his migration policy would 've saved those people . 
   that 's not much support . 
  so it 's a relatively minor lie in my opinion . 
  consider how much he 's pounded his chest about opposing the war - no . 
  it 's a big lie . 
  so big that he should probably stop repeating it every chance he gets . 
   collectively attacked . 
  once again , no connection to the clinton campaign , and [ it 's not like this violence is only happening in one way ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/us/black-church-burned-in-mississippi-with-vote-trump-scrawled-on-side.html ) . 
  stop only paying attention to violence against trump supporters . 
   i have heard nothing of nc voter suppression . 
  [ you need to read more about what 's happening on the other side of the race then ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/05/us/north-carolina-voting-rights.html ), 
  that 'd make it really hard to spell . 
  but jokes . 
  ( i 'm fine with latin ), 
  without free press democracy is a lie . 
  should n't it be in german , not latin ? 
  [ john podesta did n't even go to the piece ... ] ( http://www.snopes.com/john-podesta-spirit-cooking/ ) and even then . 
  it 's performance art . 
  who gives a shit . 
  yeah . 
  in the future . 
  she also does n't control the entire charity . 
  did you even read the article you sourced , btw ? 
   the clinton foundation has said it would no longer accept money from foreign governments if clinton is elected president and would spin off those programs that are dependent on foreign governments . 
  the doj advised comey not to tell congress . 
  and it 's in direct opposition to fbi guidelines to comment on ongoing investigations . 
  yet , somehow , trump campaign advisors knew this was coming * before * congress ? 
   you people are low info as hell . 
  you 've got to be joking here . 
  i 've seen trump supporters claim that he 's a champion of gay rights - meanwhile he literally plans to undo gay marriage and his partner * literally * wanted to start federally funded conversion therapy . 
  trump still continues to lie about iraq war support . 
  the mountain of misinformation peddled by trump supporters is sickening . 
  and on the ` booby trapping ' . 
  wearing a duck costume to a rally is not the same as organizing violence . 
  even if it was - there 's no connection to the clinton campaign there . 
  why do n't you care about the voter suppression in north carolina as much ? 
  you mean to the clinton * charity * foundation ? 
  everyone seems to forget that part for some reason . 
  guess some people do n't want to bring up the charity organization that 's ranked better than the american red cross ... 
  if you wan na compare relative sketchiness of charity organization , [ go ahead ] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/sep/23/politifact-sheet-comparing-clinton-and-trump-found/ ) . 
  only one of them has broken laws though and misappropriated funds ... as for the fbi `` excuse '' , director comey is legally not supposed to comment on ongoing investigations . 
  yet he did . 
  and even though the letter was largely vacuous with no evidence connecting to clinton - the effect that 's had on our politics is undeniable . 
  more over , rudy giuliani has admitted he was told in advance of this . 
  which is a direct violation of the hatch act . 
  republicans are acting like fascists these days . 
  they 've already decided hillary 's a criminal , now they just need to find a crime she 's committed . 
  real , weird as fuck performance art . 
  that 's it though . 
  and also does n't really have anything to do with hillary . 
  i think i misread the intent of your comment . 
  i 've been reading too much politics stuff lately ... 
  afghanistan would n't be more diverse than the us though . 
  it 'd just be less white ... and no . 
  it 's not because he 's racist or islamophobic . 
  it 's because he 's a man child who 'll probably run the country into the ground . 
  beats calling your opponent a satanist necromancer . 
  ^ i ^ wish ^ this ^ was ^ a ^ joke, 
  if he does get elected ... 
  promise me guys ... you wo n't give me shit about it when i flee the country ... 
  the right thing to do would just be to say `` you 're welcome '' pointedly and leave it be . 
  passive aggression  vaguely ethnocentric passive aggression . 
  not the time to be bragging about what every country thinks of you right now . 
  why do you say this ? 
  you got the `` new country ? '', 
  label . 
  lychees and cactus figs ... never see them . 
  pineapples are commonplace . 
  pomegranates , papayas , and mangoes less so . 
  really ? 
  i live in atlanta and i never see them . 
  maybe you 're just in a part of the us with better supermarkets . 
  granted i also do n't go to supermarkets regularly ... 
  if he 's blaming the peel ... whatever peel-able fruits am i missing out on ... ? 
  okay , are kiwis super popular in europe or something ? 
  hardly ever see them in the us . 
  went to dublin on an academic related trip once and we found kiwis in some of the sack lunches . 
  we were all very confused . 
  estonia few espa\u00d1a many, 
  but you can never leave ...
