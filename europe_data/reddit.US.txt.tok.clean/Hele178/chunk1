... are safe from the reach of islamic fundamentalists ... where in the article does it say anything about islamic fundamentalists ? 
  how do we know they are n't far-right terrorists ? 
  something that germany has no lack of . 
  the far-right has a long history of terrorism , so why assume ? 
  [ national socialist underground , a far-right german terrorist group , responsible for the murders of nine immigrants between 9 september 2000 and 6 april 2006 ; the murder of a policewoman and attempted murder of her colleague ; the 2001 and 2004 cologne bombings ; and a series of 14 bank robberies .

  i guess guarding amazon warehouses are the closest thing to guarding concentration camps for the fuhrer that they could find . 
  well , i do n't blame them . 
  it seems like most czechs do n't even want to live in czech rep , granted they have a choice . 
  [ around 250 czech doctors leave the country each year to work and live abroad -- particularly in germany and the uk .

  sorry about that . 
  i did n't see that it was posted , and it 's so rare these days to get any good media about the refugees . 
  they wo n't have to all go to sweden . 
  even us and canada are accepting them . 
  [ the uk will accept up to 20,000 refugees from syria over the next five years , david cameron has told mps .

  ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/accept-tens-thousands-refugees-150921013907236.html ) [ canada vows to accept 13,000 more refugees from syria and iraq ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canada-to-accept-13000-more-refugees-from-syria-and-iraq/article22332408/ ) i mean , the uk 's attempt to help is pretty pathetic , but we at least are supposed to take 70,000 refugees this year total , and up to 100,000 in 2017 . 
  i think the germans have really set the bar quite high with their generosity , accepting around 1.5 m refugees this year alone . 
  i think once sanders gets elected we might be able to challenge that number though . 
   i 've got a job that helps keep the peace in my country , i work hard and pay my taxes . 
  i 've never been a burden to my country , i help bring it forward . 
  oh sorry , i did n't see that list you made of all those things that syrians ca n't do in poland . 
  i guess you are right . 
  and to think . 
  all a person needed to do to deserve to live in poland was have a job , pay-taxes , and not try to be a burden on the country . 
  surely no person from syria , iraq , turkey , palestine , egypt , sudan , eritrea , afghanistan , and all the others , could ever do those three things . 
  you poles sure are a special type compared to the rest of the world . 
  edit : i just called my syrian friend and asked him if they have taxes or jobs in syria , and he said `` no '' . 
  i said , `` well , you better not go to poland . '', 
  no one has done anything , ever , to decide where they would be born . 
  being born in syria or poland is not a choice anyone has ever made for themselves . 
  you mentioning fighting in wars , working , and paying taxes . 
  what is preventing a syrian from doing that in poland ? 
  syrians are incapable of fighting in wars , working , and paying taxes ? 
  if that is all polish people have done them-self to deserve living in poland , then what is it that prevents a migrant from doing it ? 
  nothing . 
  there is fundamentally no difference between a syrian and pole . 
  a pole can learn arabic , become muslim , go to mecca , cook syrian cuisine , fight in the syrian army , and work in syria . 
  but god forbid the syrians do those things in poland . 
  then people like you might actually have to come to terms with the fact you are no different than them , and deserve to be treated no different than them . 
   what did ** i ** do to deserve to live in poland ? 
  let 's start off and say that my ** grandfather , his father and their fathers ** so you 've begun a list of things you 've done , with a list of things you did n't do ? 
  the question is still unanswered . 
  you did nothing to deserve to live in poland . 
  you deserve as much recognition for the fact you were born in poland , as you do for your skin color . 
   the syrians have not , are not and will not contribute anything to my country . 
  their ancestors did n't die for my country . 
  we have nothing in common , and do n't say humanity because you will make me cringe . 
  pretty much , all you want to say is , poland is a wealthy country that i was born in , something which i had no control over and no responsibility for , and i do not want to share this wealth , that i did nothing for , with a syrian . 
  imagine if there were a man who had been injured , and as a result of his injury , he needed physical therapy for several months before he would be a productive member of society again . 
  what should the state do ? 
  pay for his therapy so he could be a productive member of society , not pay for his therapy and have a disabled person that must be supported by the state for the rest of his life , or send this person to a bordering state so they need not care for them at all . 
  so it should be clear what my answer is , then . 
  yes , the refugees deserve to be paid more than the `` native '' europeans , because they are at a disadvantage in life . 
  most come to europe with nothing , others come carrying only their children . 
  when they arrive they need every necessity that people need , and then more to be able to compensate for what they do n't have . 
  more because they have nothing to begin with , unlike the `` native '' europeans . 
  the only way to make them productive members of society is to spend the resources on them to make them productive , and the more resources that are spent on helping them , the sooner they will be able to start caring for themselves independently . 
  now , i have a question for you , why would you take someone who is already marginalized in life , and then marginalize them again ? 
  all people should be treated equally , no matter where they were born , and where they end up living . 
  you treat being syrian , afghan , or eritrean as if it should be a handicap in life , as an excuse you can use to prevent them from being treated like the people you consider `` natives '' . 
  if terrorists or a fascist dictator , like assad , destroyed your home and killed your family and you were forced to flee for your life to another country , how would you feel if the people there said , `` you ca n't live here syrian '' or `` only give half the amount everyone else gets to the syrian '' . 
  or how about this , a favorite of some of the posters here on reddit : `` do n't let him work because he 's a syrian '' , followed by , `` the syrians do n't work they just live off of us . '', 
   a refugee , somebody who has ** not contributed anything to my country , is of different culture , religion , disposition ** why is this important ? 
  what did you do to deserve to live in poland ? 
  you did absolutely nothing , you were just born there . 
  and why does it matter if they are from china , india , libya , or turkey , or if they are muslim , buddhist , atheist , or whatever ? 
  none of that matters . 
  a lot of poles have moved to the uk , and there are some people there , like nigel farage , who do n't want them there . 
  who say roughly the same things as you , that poles have '' ** not contributed anything to my country , are of a different culture , religion , disposition , [ etc. ] ** '' . 
  and for these reasons poles do n't deserve the same as the british . 
  and for this people call him a racist . 
  which is quite right . 
  there should be no double standard here . 
  poles have as much a right to be in the uk as syrians do to be in poland . 
  and just like poles in the uk deserve to be treated just like the british , the same goes for any asylum seeker who would go to poland . 
  they might have to , and it 's probably best they do , because there might be asylum seekers hiding in the crates . 
  we would n't want them to mix with our `` culture '' or `` race '' , or allow them to travel through our countries to germany or sweden . 
  right ? 
  that 's what we 're doing here now in this sub , right ? 
   estpol 1 , made up of 25 officers , left for slovenia estonia has an interesting history with economic migrants , so i have trouble believing that they are against asylum seekers for economic reasons . 
  and , honestly , estonia needs * people * , they should be taking more `` economic migrants '' than sweden or germany , not trying to prevent them from coming to europe . 
  they 'll probably get it . 
  the worse consequence of all this seems to be that hungary will become trapped behind a large iron fence , and refusing to overcome their xenophobia , they will cease to communicate with the outside world by any other means than the internet . 
  then , when their economy eventually collapses , we will have another crisis , but hungarians in the place of syrians . 
   `` the french have understood that the eu does not live up to the utopia they were sold . 
  i want to destroy the eu , not europe !, 
  i believe in a europe of nation states . 
  i believe in airbus and ariane , in a europe based on cooperation . 
  but i do n't want this european soviet union . '', 
  -- marine le pen actively working to undermine the goals of the eu , and then giving speeches about how the eu is failing to fulfill it 's goals . 
  i see she 's taken some pointers from her financier vladimir putin based on his handling of ukraine . 
   how are we supposed to stop them from leaving ? 
  have you ever considered that maybe your country just is n't trying to be welcoming to refugees ? 
  instead of saying that the current amount of benefits are not enough for them to be comfortable , and that 's why you should n't have to accept them , why does n't your country do more for them , like romania ? 
   [ foreigners seeking asylum in romania will receive a state allowance of ... [ around ] 226 euros ... about 45 euros higher than the average pension in romania , or 13 times higher than a student 's monthly allowance . 
  the draft law approved by the government has been tabled in parliament for debate and approval ... each refugee can also get another 150 euros monthly to pay the rent , in case they could n't be located in structures financed by the state . 
  ] ( http://www.balkaneu.com/bigger-income-refugees/ ) edit : down-votes but no rebuttal ? 
  could it be that there is no away to justify the argument that asylum seekers are at fault for not being comfortable in poland , when the polish authorities will not even attempt to make their country comfortable for them to live in ?
