  do n't assume that opposition to irrationally strict regulatory burdens implies advocating insufficient oversight . 
  i know people who have worked with genetic engineering projects . 
  they shop at the same stores and eat the same food as everyone else . 
  if they 're trying to , for whatever unspecified and presumably dastardly reason , exterminate people they sure are being stupid about it . 
   cross polination this is a manufactured controversy . 
  cross pollination occurs with all sorts of plants . 
  if i 'm growing galeux d'eysines squash and you 're growing blue hubbard squash and your squash cross pollinates mine and i wish to save my seed , we might have a problem . 
  no one would ever say this is some sort of special problem with heirloom varieties , but somehow when the exact same thing happens with gmo crops , it is a big issue ? 
   effect on the surrounding insects such as ? 
  you can actually get higher insect biodiversity on farms using bt crops due to reduced pesticide spraying . 
  if i were you i would be more worried about the opportunity cost of non-ge crops . 
   what are basically bullshit copyright issues with organisms i 'm sorry but i fail to see how patents ( not copyright ) is bad here . 
  i work with plant breeding . 
  it is n't always simple , easy , cheap , and straightforward . 
  those who improve agriculture deserve to make a living . 
  if you do n't want to use a patented organism , do n't use it , or wait for the patent to expire ( as monsanto 's first herbicide tolerant soy does in a few months here in the us ) . 
  furthermore , even if we assume this to be a bad thing , it is n't exclusive to gmo crops . 
  for example , my favorite apple , snowsweet ( not yet sold commercially , and the trees probably are not available in europe , so you 'll just have to believe me when i say it has a phenomenal apple taste with a hint of lychee ) , is both non-gmo and patented . 
  let me ask you , without patents , how do you expect people like for example the ziagers , creators of delicious stone fruit hybrids ( pluot , aprium , nectaplum , pluerry , ect . 
  ) , or frankie 's nursery , developer of the amazing low acid meli kalima pineapple , to continue to develop new varieties of crop if someone else can just reproduce their work for free and leave them holding the bill ? 
   creating gmo 's that are resistant to pesticides specificaly made for those gmo 's so what ? 
  a goes with b , how 's that immoral ? 
  even if it was , glyphosate , the predominant herbicide you refer to , is off patent . 
  anyone can make it . 
  in a few months , the soybean that resists it will also be off patent . 
   you only hear the ermagerd bad for muh health part of the green lobby because that 's what best resonates with your everyday people . 
  are you implying that it is okay to blatantly lie to people if it achieves a goal , and a highly questionable one at that ? 
   the eu has a banned until proven safe policy looks a lot more like banned until the populism catches up with the science to me . 
  fact is , gmo crops have been in use since the 90 's , and they 've had a pretty darned good record . 
  there is no scientific justification for the european stance on genetically engineered crops . 
   and do n't act as if the biotech industry is full of saints . 
  ah , the old ` the industry is n't saintly therefore x is suspect ' , the staple emotional argument of anti-vaccine nutters everywhere . 
  you really want to do down that road ? 
  hell , it is n't as if there is n't plenty of good work coming out of europe , like [ virus resistant grapes ] ( http://www.gmo-safety.eu/news/620.apple-trees-destroyed.html ) in france , or [ disease resistant apples ] ( http://www.gmo-safety.eu/news/620.apple-trees-destroyed.html ) in germany , or [ late blight resistant potatoes ] ( http://www.biofortified.org/2011/05/french-anti-science-vandals-invade-a-belgium-farm-and-destroy-crops/ ) in the netherlands , or [ disease resistant olives ] ( http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/06/italian-anti-gm-group-wins-destruction-of-30-year-old-olive-tree-project.html ) in italy , or [ insect repelling wheat ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/9293301/scientists-insist-gm-wheat-is-safe-as-protesters-vow-to-tear-up-crop.html ) in the uk . 
  all publicly funded , none allowed to be commercially cultivated . 
  and by the way , the first three were destroyed by ~ ~ book burning thugs ~ ~ anti-gmo protesters , the italian project did n't even have the proper regulation in place to continue and was also destroyed , and the one in the uk was met with threats of destruction ... and somehow this is has to do with corporations ? 
  personally , i 'd love to spend some time working in a european country , that would be a nice life experience , but realistically , destruction of research is a very real threat , so do n't give me that tired trope that this is all about the biotech industry . 
  no european country has even approved imports of the transgenic rainbow papaya ( which i 've eaten quite a lot of and can tell you are delicious ) which was developed publicly by the university of hawai'i ... how does that play into the corporate angle ? 
  maybe if you lowered the absurd , unscientific regulatory burden there would be more publicly funded non-corporate gmos out there , but you 're kidding yourself if you think the anti-gmo crowd would be happy with that , look at the reaction to the non-corporate international rice research institute 's [ golden rice ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/08/26/golden_rice_attack_in_philippines_anti_gmo_activists_lie_about_protest_and.html ) . 
  according to the article , that 's what they want to do :  he said in a tweet : `` the image of david , armed , offends and infringes the law . 
  we will take action against the american company so that it immediately withdraws its campaign . '', 
   historical heritage and fine arts board curator cristina acidini has issued a legal notice to armalite to withdraw the image , saying it distorts the artwork . 
   the government says it has copyright on the commercial use of images of david . 
  i think there are newer plant designs capable of reusing the ` waste ' . 
  people are still learning about the streisand effect i see . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.ilpost.it/2014/03/08/david-armato-pubblicita/david_ar50a1_72/ ) the image . 
  does italian copyright law really cover things 500 years old , and is there really a law saying what you can and ca n't do with images of historic art ? 
  that 's rather silly . 
  i saw an interview with walter jones ( the guy who played the part of zack ) were he said that they wanted a white lead with a black best friend , and as it so happened , the red ranger and black ranger were best friends in the original japanese show . 
  also , the first person to be selected to play the yellow ranger was not asian , but she got the boot when she asked for more money ( which later was why the black , yellow , and red rangers were replaced once the show became popular ... tv executives do n't seem to be a generous bunch ) . 
  that 's as much of an explanation as there is to that anyway , if it helps your childhood any . 
  and if not , they 're still running new episodes after all this time . 
  not all things gmo are banned in all of europe . 
  in [ some eu countries ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-educ2h6kf18/uvxsgm7msbi/aaaaaaaaaog/frziqfovsxu/s1600/developing+vs+industrial+countries.jpg ) ( spain , portugal , czech republic , romania , and slovakia ) , some ge crops are grown . 
  also , there are medicines like insulin that are produced with gmo bacteria , so not everything gmo is banned ( although because most people do not know medicine can come from gmos they do not complain about it ) . 
  this issue is basically some eu people saying [ this new variety ] ( http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/event/default.asp?eventid=113 ) of gmo corn should be approved , while some member states are saying it should not . 
  gmo crops do not get approved very often in the eu , even after they have been shown to be safe . 
   we need a prescription for any medicine that can pose safety issues . 
  you are making an invalid comparison . 
  biologically active pharmaceuticals and crops not producing biologically active agents are not remotely comparable . 
  if we were talking about a plant producing a drug , one of the ` pharma-crops ' as they are called , things would be different . 
  but these are n't them . 
  a handful of specialized proteins , including a well studied and commonly used insecticidal protein , do not merit the same level of scrutiny that a drug does , but nonetheless , the approved gmo crops have been heavily studied with no ill health effects demonstrated . 
  number one and two both occur with conventional breeding . 
  take the [ lenape potato ] ( http://boingboing.net/2013/03/25/the-case-of-the-poison-potato.html ) for example , bred in the 60 's , it turned out to have high levels of toxic solanine . 
  and consider how many people breed crops to make a living , for example , the pluots which were developed and patented by zaiger genetics . 
  frankly , i do n't see a problem with plant breeders getting paid . 
  maybe you would like to work for free . 
  i do n't . 
  and speaking of lawyers , i 'm not too clear on the laws in the countries of europe ( any non-american people working with plant breeding in here ? 
  ) , but if you propagated those non-gmo , conventionally bred , patented crops without a license , then yes you could be sued . 
  that is n't lawyer controlled any more than any other patented thing is . 
  and i for one like it that way . 
  my favorite apple , snowsweet ( which is not yet widely commercially grown , unfortunately , but try it if you ever get the chance to try it ... it is very sweet with a faint hint of lychee ) was developed using money from the royalties on the honeycrisp apple , which used to be patented . 
  genetic engineering is a process , not a product . 
  i can not and will not claim that every single plant that has ever been or ever will be genetically engineered is going to be safe , but to put that statement in context , i ca n't claim that all conventionally bred crops are safe either . 
  well , the eu does import about [ 60 kg ] ( http://www.europabio.org/sites/default/files/europabio_factsheet3_trade_in_agriculture.pdf ) of ge crops per person per year , mostly i 'd guess for livestock feed . 
  if you are asking about benefits , they could benefit europe the same way they benefit others : insect , weed , and pathogen related benefits . 
  i fail to see the problem with that . 
  and , of course , if there was somewhat less european opposition to gmo crops , there could be other benefits from homegrown projects , like the virus resistant grapes in france that [ were destroyed ] ( http://redgreenandblue.org/2010/08/17/a-sad-day-for-wine-a-sad-day-for-science/ ) , or the disease resistant gmo olives in italy that [ were destroyed ] ( http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/06/italian-anti-gm-group-wins-destruction-of-30-year-old-olive-tree-project.html ) , or the disease resistant gmo apples in germany that [ were destroyed ] ( http://www.gmo-safety.eu/news/620.apple-trees-destroyed.html ) , or the disease resistant gmo potatoes in belgium that [ were destroyed ] ( http://www.biofortified.org/2011/05/french-anti-science-vandals-invade-a-belgium-farm-and-destroy-crops/ ) , or the insect repelling gmo wheat in the uk that fortunately was not destroyed but received [ threats ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/9293301/scientists-insist-gm-wheat-is-safe-as-protesters-vow-to-tear-up-crop.html ) of destruction , all of which was publicly funded research . 
   and heavy modifiying what do you mean by ` heavy modifying ' ? 
  so far the crops that are genetically engineered only have a handful of proteins inserted . 
  there are a few different bacillus thuringiensis proteins in the insect resistant crops , a pair of enzymes ( either the c4 epsps gene from agrobacterium or the bar gene from streptomyces hygroscopicus , depending on the type ) & the ctp4 gene from petunia to transport an enzyme in the herbicide tolerant ones , virus coat protein segments from papaya ringspot virus or cucumber mosaic , watermelon mosaic , and zucchini yellow mosaic virus in virus resistant crops ( again , depending on the crop ) , the cspb gene for drought resistance by acting as an chaperone for genetic messages from bacillus subtilisa , a genes called market or reporter genes ( nptii or gus genes ) that aide in the original development of the crop , and promoter and terminator sequences regulating the genes . 
  i do n't know that i would consider any of that stuff ` heavy modification ' . 
  this really is n't as frankenstein as its made out to be . 
  if you want to see some real striking differences , check out [ teosinte ] ( http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/070201_corn ) . 
  that is what corn was bred from.or get some broccoli , kohlrabi , cauliflower , and cabbage . 
  they are the same species . 
  or go buy some beets and chard . 
  they 're also the same species . 
  begun , the toblerone wars have . 
   one modification is to splice a pesticide producing gene in the target genome a pesticide in a plant is ubiquitous in the plant kingdom . 
  plants , as a general rule , do n't move too much , so unlike animal life , they ca n't run or fight anything trying to eat them . 
  how , then , is it that the trillions of insects on earth do n't devour all plant life ? 
  part of that reason is pesticides . 
  take black pepper , for instance . 
  do you think it produces piperine , the chemical that gives black pepper its taste , in its seeds so that some primate will grind up and eat its offspring ? 
  nope , piperine is a pesticidal defensive mechanism . 
  plants evolved the ability to produce chemical defenses to counter things that can move that want to eat them . 
  to simply talk about a plant having pesticides in them is pretty misleading without the context that all plants have pesticides in them , pesticides that can , speaking of putting things in context , [ be bred for ] ( http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/ar/archive/may02/corn0502.htm ) , though i ca n't help but notice no one cares when conventional breeders do that .
