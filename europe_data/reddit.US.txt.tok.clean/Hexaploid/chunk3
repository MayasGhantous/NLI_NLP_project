  furthermore , the insecticide you are talking about is from the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis , which has been used for years without ill effect , not been shown to be harmful , and at any rate , the crops themselves have not been shown to be harmful , and as feynman once said , ` if it disagrees with experiment it is wrong . ', 
  experiment says the currently used ge crops are safe . 
   what about biodiversity what about it ? 
  you ca n't just drop a word and call that a debate either , since there are multiple ways of discussing biodiversity . 
  if you are talking farm level , they you should support ge crops . 
  it has been shown that , due to reduced insecticide sprays on bt crops ( one of the three main types of ge crops currently in use ) there are higher levels of non-target insect life . 
  there are reports of both [ beneficial ] ( http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11153.html?wt.ec_i ) and [ detrimental ] ( http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5982/1151 ) effects of this , benefit in that non-target insect predators are more prevalent , detrimental in that non-target pests previously controlled by insecticides can become problematic . 
  if you are talking biodiversity within a crop , then the topic becomes meaningless . 
  the gmo traits are commonly bred into a multitude of different lines . 
  the original gmo with the desired trait is produced , not always in the line you want , necessitating that the gene be bred into other lines . 
  for example , [ here ] ( http://www.seminis.com/global/us/products/pages/professionalgrowerssummersquash.aspx ) you can see a number of lines of transgenic summer squash . 
  for the big crop like corn and soy , there are a lot more different lines with transgenic traits . 
  if you mean species level agro-biodiversity , like eating crops other than the major ones ( like teff , taro , pawpaw , salak , ect . 
  ) , then that , while extremely important and deserving of much more attention , cultivation , and research , than they often get , has nothing to do with gmos . 
   the huge socio-economical impact you mean like papaya farmers in hawai'i not going out of business thanks to transgenic papaya literally [ saving the industry ] ( http://www.agbioforum.org/v7n12/v7n12a07-gonsalves.htm ) ? 
  or farmers not needing as much insecticide due to transgenic corn and cotton , leading to less [ pesticide poisoning ] ( http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/07/bt_cotton_cuts_pesticide_poiso.html ) , [ reduced losses ] ( http://www.biofortified.org/wp-content/uploads//2012/12/bn712-bt_cotton_chomp.jpg ) , and [ higher incomes ] ( http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/06/25/1203647109 ) ? 
  or maybe we should talk about the socio-economic impact of hundreds of thousands of children going blind because greenpeace is working hard to block golden rice . 
  scientists do look lots of issues , the problem here is that there is two parts of the so-called gmo debate : the scientific one , and the public one . 
  the scientific one is looking at actual issues in a non-sensationalist way , for example , corn borers that have developed resistance to the gmo corn . 
  then there are the anti-gmo people who will run around misrepresenting the issue entirely with shouts of ` superbugs . ', 
   that 's the problem we do n't know the long term effects they have . 
  there is n't any evidence whatsoever that there will be long term effects either . 
  could there be ? 
  well , maybe , but you could make that same claim about anything . 
  maybe the smallpox vaccine has some crazy , complicated long term effect that will give everyone autism tomorrow , and you ca n't prove that it wo n't . 
  however , the inability to disprove a thing is not the same as proving it . 
   we go by the precaution principle . 
  the [ dragon in the garage principle ] ( http://www.godlessgeeks.com/links/dragon.htm ) would be a better term . 
  the precautionary principle demands that you prove that something will ** not ** be harmful . 
  problem is , strictly speaking , that 's impossible , so unless you set criteria for what is considered not harmful , otherwise you can move the goalpost forever . 
  without reasonable set criteria , the precautionary principle suffers the same problem that other poorly reasoned things do : no falsifiability . 
  for example , prove to me that the earth was not created 6000 years ago . 
  you ca n't do it , you ca n't prove that wrong , which is why creationism is not science . 
  under the precautionary principle , you can not falsify the claim that gmos are unsafe in the long term . 
  it is a poor risk assessment method . 
  you have to compare fact based benefits and fact based risks , not fact based benefits with speculation . 
  this seems like another one of those things were people who know what they 're talking about are mocked by those who do n't for their own misunderstandings . 
  i highly doubt they were just out to kill a giraffe , and as for the feeding , it does n't seem like they did it out of the blue on a normal visiting day . 
  what , did n't anyone grow up watching nature documentaries ? 
  anyway , i 'll bet the lions are quite happy with how things turned out . 
  [ see this ? 
  ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/photos/carcass-marius-male-giraffe-eaten-lions-put-down-photo-140745198.html ) those are some happy lions . 
  raspberries are [ rubus idaeus . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rubus_idaeus ) they are either red or yellow , although some species are [ purple-black ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rubus_occidentalis ) , and hollow . 
  this is what distinguishes them from the larger blackberries , which are not hollow ( and fun fact , can even be [ white ] ( http://bulbnrose.x10.mx/heredity/burbank/whiteblackberry/whiteblackberry.html ) ) . 
  ` brambles ' refers to fruits of the rubus genus in general . 
  blaeberries that the parent poster refers to are probably blue european members of the vaccinium genus , most likely [ vaccinium myrtillus . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaccinium_myrtillus ) your first image describes a bunch of hybrids among the rubus genus , most of which are not common in commercial cultivation ( not here in the us anyway , maybe they are in europe ) . 
  i always check the country of origin on everything i buy . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seeing anything made in russia , except some seaberry juice i once found in a local eastern european market . 
  what do they export anyway , besides gas , alcohol , and razor blades ? 
  good on them . 
  the notion that males should n't wear historically female clothing is a ridiculous notion that needs to die anyway . 
   modern gm crops ( and to some extent , traditional ones ) have nutritional gaps and other misalignments with our digestive systems . 
  i am unaware of any evidence of that being the case . 
   at least not in the long term you could say the same of [ conventional breeding . 
  ] ( http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2011/110124shuklegenes.html ) i understand your argument , but you must realize that your criticism is universal of plant improvement , not just genetic engineering , which makes singling out genetic engineering pretty inconsistent . 
  you should also be aware that , in the case of insect resistance , there were other factors at play , like cultivation practices and not enough variety in the resistance traits ( each of which is a topic in and of itself ) . 
   unpredictable interaction with native flora/fauna once the genes start circulating in the wild such as ? 
   broken promises of higher yields and pest resistance that 's a bit complected . 
  lets say you make something resistant to pests . 
  do you think that will increase yield ? 
  in theory yes , but what if farmers are already using pesticides to protect the crop ? 
  then the yield gain will be minimal , but there is more to things than yield . 
  now you need less pesticides , which i hope we can agree is a good thing . 
  also , consider that the genetically engineered rainbow papaya saved the hawaiian papaya industry ... how 's that for yield gain ? 
  if you are saying the promise of pest resistance is broken , consider this : in wheat , the resistance to hessian flies is failing . 
  in tomatoes , late blight has overcome the tomato 's resistance to the disease . 
  in raspberries , aphids have gotten around the raspberry 's defense to the aphids . 
  this was all done with conventional breeding . 
  when it comes to biotic factors , there will always be a red queen 's race as long as something applies selection pressure ( like pest resistance ) , and evolution does not care where that pressure comes from . 
  do you consider conventional breeding a broken promise because of the examples i listed ? 
  if not , why do you hold genetic engineering to a different standard ? 
   no long term studies and most existing studies have been funded and led by the producing companies . 
  [ take your pick . 
  ] ( http://www.biofortified.org/genera/studies-for-genera/independent-funding/ ), 
  do you consider wheat , triticale , strawberries , and pluots to be natural ? 
  good lord i ca n't believe people are upvoting that claptrap . 
  i 'm on that list . 
  i have no connection to any biotech company , although i could be making a lot more if i did , and unless the so-called shills are putting on a good show , some of the people on that list are farmers and plant scientists ( how strange that such people would have strong opinions on this !, 
  i myself work on some non-corporate research with roots , the goal of which is to reduce fertilizer use and increase sustainability , which apparently makes me a monsanto puppet ) . 
  this is why it is so hard to counter the anti-gmo movement . 
  no one supports genetic engineering ? 
  no one gets the facts . 
  people support it ? 
  they are dismissed as part of the conspiracy . 
  organic rally ? 
  industry funded or not ( and make no mistake , there is profit in organic ) , its grassroots !, 
  someone posts a lot on gmos ? 
  clearly making , according to the reply to the comment you linked , 38k a year for it . 
  if you believe that , you set yourself up to be ` right ' every time . 
  maybe frozen pizzas are just better on the other side of the atlantic , but i think they 're pretty good . 
  that and another brand are the only frozen pizzas my local stores carry that are n't awful . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jan/24/worldwide-cancer-rates-uk-rate-drops ) , our cancer rate is before norway and after france , so your observation might be off . 
  as for fruits and vegetables , there are only three of them that are genetically engineered in the us : summer squash , sweet corn , and papaya , all of which taste fine to me . 
  any taste differences you notice have nothing to do with genetic engineering and must be due to something else , like the season , or the variety of a fruit . 
  would learning norwegian be enough to understand , at least written , swedish and danish ? 
  i have always been under the impression that the scandinavian languages had some degree of mutual intelligibility , so one who learns norwegian would have some understanding of danish and swedish , which increases the value of learning one of them . 
  also , there 's [ \u00c6\u00d8\u00c5 , ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f488ujaqgmw ) which i think is pretty cool . 
  someone should convince people to stop [ blaming scientists ] ( http://www.nature.com/news/italian-scientists-vilified-in-wake-of-olive-tree-deaths-1.17651 ) for this .
