the green party is the de facto far-left party here . 
  that party which you mentioned ( which i never heard of or saw on the ballet ) only got like 50,000-60 ,000 votes last election , which is hardly anything to brag about . 
  usa = target of the memes russia = commissioner of the memes finland = essence of the memes, 
  what happened with the roma during socialist era ? 
  were they allowed to live their lifestyle under a centralized economy ? 
  you forgot to include the greek junta up in that too . 
  i ca n't think of any . 
  it seems that right-wing populism mostly worked well-intended when it was done by leaders like those mentioned who implemented more social policies and who were typically moderate when they actually reached office . 
  all of those mentioned would 've probably been disliked and would be going against progress in current times with their type of diplomatic and foreign policies and mentality , which could be argued were necessary for their times but no longer are n't . 
  it seems like in order for conservatism to work out with current global progress , it has to be far more moderate and emphasize more on technicalities and details , and not populism . 
  yeah , he 's more debatable , especially from a modern standpoint . 
  i guess for the context of his time , he was a centralist populist . 
  depends on how you constitute right-wing populism , but here 's some candidates i think were such by according to this definition :  right-wing populism is a political ideology that rejects the current political consensus and often combines laissez-faire , ethnocentrism and anti-elitism . 
  it is considered populism ** otto van bismarck ** : was a chauvinist but also adopted a bunch of social welfare policies to maintain power and win over the masses . 
  but did n't champion himself much as a common-man characteristic for the populace though ( which trump has n't really either ) . 
  ** theodore roosevelt ** : adopted a lot of politically-progressive social and economic policies advocated by the democrats of his time , and that were against the zeitgeist of the republican party . 
  was a somewhat american nationalist for trying to have a strong unified identity and was a believer of manifest destiny ( which was n't supported by most progressives of his time ) , and enacted pro-expansionist and imperialistic policies . 
  ** dwight d. eisenhower ** : resumed a lot of new-deal policies , expanded education and education planning on a federal level ( by subtly including the funding in defense spending bills ) , marketed himself as a political outsider , was in favor of market deregulation , enacted operation wetback that deported millions of mexican laborers in the us ( some of which were american citizens ) , ran on the appeal of the influx of vets in the us for his image as a general , was a staunch anti-communist and was tolerant of mccarthy . 
  called jfk 's social program expansions as being unrealistic and too liberal . 
  ** charles de gaulle ** : was a bit of a chauvinist , tolerant of french imperialism , advocated for maintaining frances ' ` whiteness ' and ` frenchness ' and making sure foreign influences and people did n't ` taint ' it , flirted between global powers at various times to make sure they did n't become too powerful over france ; but enacted the dirigisme which helped france recover , and in it , progressive labour policies . 
  help advocate for european integration to combat the dominance of atlantic and soviet powers . 
  flirted with quebec ' to become independent in the * vive le qu\u00e9bec libre * speech that it 's reasonable to say he was nationalistic .

  i 'm not familiar with the doctrines and canon of zoroastrianism , but sources during the achaemenid period certainly did n't suggest that slavery was forbidden in the empire or was condemned as an institution , neither with the parthians , as-well with the sassanids ( who is the earliest iranic empire that we have their literature and complete texts from pre-islamic persia , and can trace writers to ) it was n't banned either . 
  the sassanids forbid selling zoroastrian slaves to infidels , and allowed slaves who converted to zoroastrianism under a infidel master to be entitled to manumission so long as they compensated their masters . 
  during that era zoroastrians could own slaves and they could own other zoroastrians . 
  if a infidel master converted to zoroastrianism , then his slaves were no longer entitled to manumission if they also converted . 
  i 'm not sure how conversions could 've worked for a slave either , seeing how zoroastrians have conventionally in modern history rejected infidels from converting into their religion and argue that zoroaster was set on purifying the pre-existing mazda worshiping in ancient eastern iran from foreign influences . 
  there 's not a strong consensus of how ` zoroastrian ' achaemenid persia was compared to the mostly extant knowledge we have from the sassanid era which was much more documented . 
  old persian inscriptions and documents have achaemenid royals praising ahuramazda as a supreme god , but also venerating subordinate deities , showing that they were likely either polytheistic at the time or henotheistic , while not mentioning zoroaster . 
  we do n't tell him where the nukes are . 
  obama probably gave him the wrong codes anyways or took the battery out of the launch device . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  they took slaves of countries that resisted them or rebelled , and allowed slavery . 
  proof is slave receipts at persepolis and other achaemenid garrisons , the arsama letters , wills and marriage documents in the elephantine papyri , greek sources , and darius ' behistun inscription which he declares he restored the slaves to the people that gaumata took from them . 
  there is however , zero sources or inferences that they ever outlawed slavery -- neither with their own proclamations or with any sort of mentioning by other sources . 
  ah , yes . 
  ca n't forget that caltech , mit , epfl , titech , or so on being the progenitors of social activists or being the kind to enact these policies . 
  the greco-romans ( and most mediterranean navies of antiquity ) also had smaller light war vessels for swift river traveling , or to easily carry over land too . 
  the heavy warships were commissioned and serviced if they expected naval resistance . 
  the vikings ' lack of such ships just represents that their neighbors and enemies likely did n't have such naval resistance to warrant having those ships , or that they did n't confront those who did . 
  naval superiority to the greco-romans , meant more freedom to navigate around lands instead of having to relying on river jumping as their only option like the vikings . 
  and you guys mention the fact that the vikings vassals were such an innovation that allowed to plunder and conquer the lands that they did was something exceptional . 
  the greco-romans often did n't need that -- they often just led large and formal naval expeditions and land marched to targeted lands and just secured them rather than pillage , and made them pay tribute over time . 
   could you carry any of those ships you mention through the country ? 
  depends how far , but yes . 
  look up diolkos . 
  spartans carried their fleet of triremed like half a dozen km overland the isthmus of corinth with it to assault the athenians in 428 and 411 . 
   it is 21.58 m long and 5.10 m broad , with a mast of approximately 9 -- 10 m. with a sail of c. 90 m \u00b2 , the ship could achieve a speed up to 10 knots . 
  that 's cute . 
  that 's like , what , a couple meters shorter than a bireme ( 700-600 b.c ? ) ? 
  and over 10 meters shorter than a trireme ? 
  i just got my question for ya ' ... which is , um ... oh yeah !, 
  : how does it compare to the all mighty [ tessarakonteres ] ( http://imgur.com/a/5l237 ) ( obligatory [ sound music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vazsf8mtfyk ) ) !?!, 
  over 130 meters long , 4000 oarsmen , 300 oars ( 14 - 17 meters long - oh baby ) , 2850 marines , and ~ 400 officers !, 
  that 's a larger crew size than modern us aircraft carriers ( 6000-6500 ) !, 
  ^ here 's ^ a ^ compilation ^ of ^ classical ^ mediterranean [ ^ warships ] ( http://imgur.com/a/8jhjk ) no wonder the vikings waited so long to emerge . 
  racial crime statistics by the fbi actually do help document trends and changes to see what policies or causes might help or harm ( think changes in poverty levels in certain racial groups , health concerns ( like with gasoline lead-levels , current cultural trends ) as well as hate-crimes . 
  racial preconceptions would continue to exist if the fbi did withheld these reports from the public -- probably to an extent more severe . 
  it 's how these reports are interpreted and whether it 's done in a appropriate manner by the observer . 
  it 's appropriate for swedes to have access to immigrant crime numbers and data comparing them to the rest of the population before getting to vote on immigration matters . 
  later greek writers attribute the amazonians to be from regions conveniently practically inaccessible for them to travel to ( or have anyone travel to ) , often in central asian ( like herodotus , who restricts it to above the caucausus mountains where the historic scythians occupied ) or far regions of libya ( which libya , to the greeks , was the entire sahara west of the banks of the nile ) . 
  they were a fictional people -- probably derived from some archetype myth shared among many indo-europeans that was later rationalized by placing them near the scythians because of the similarity between the historic myth and the later allege customs that circulated in the geographical curious greek circles . 
  you mean like what resulted after the 1933 march election with the nsdap and dnvp coalition in germany ? 
  trump needs his own safe-space first .

  le dude, 
  plato was said to have died from old age while listening to a thracian flute-girl play for him one evening . 
  there 's references in literary sources -- especially plato 's own -- that state or imply that ` flute-girls ' were n't simply just music entertainers , but often attractive young maidens that also served as prostitutes at symposiums or other kinds of parties for the men , especially the thracian kind , which were likely always slaves who did n't have a say if they were to be used as prostitutes by their pimp owners . 
  so i imagine plato would enjoy this sight, 
  not that many people can go to the doctor if they 're uninsured . 
  many hold off going because they have high deductibles and co-pays and their condition worsens from them holding it off, 
  we have zero federal regulations regarding paid time here . 
  only in emergencies . 
  most bankruptcies are from medical debt -- most of them had insurance . 
  this is why we shoot up our workplaces when we snap . 
  we have no concept of setting aside income from our payroll to go into paternity leave here . 
  insurance does n't cover it and neither does the government with our payroll taxes in many countries . 
  only 12 % of work places have paid maternity leave policies . 
  practically none of them match up to any sort of developed european nation standard . 
  20 weeks is considered to be the upper range that those who get it receive . 
  50 % of us workers earn below $ 30,000 , 70 % under $ 50,000 , and like ~ 78 % under $ 60,000 . 
  do n't be fooled by gdp per capita that people like to bring up when ~ 60 % of people here are in the relative middle class while its ~ 70-80 % in many european countries , or by household income . 
  most us companies do n't have the concept of `` unpaid vacation '' , they might have unpaid sick or family leave at their will for employees that do n't have any paid days or used them up , but i have n't heard of any cases where people planned ahead to take off a week or two of unpaid vacation and told their bosses that it was for a vacation . 
  i do n't believe the number off people who have 28 days of vacation exceeds 5-10 % of the workforce , and most likely less , and i 'm not sure many of those even use them -- a shit ton of workers do n't even use all their pto for a variety of reasons . 
  when i heard that in some european countries , it 's a norm for a sizeable chunk of the workforce to take a month off for a vacation ( often in the summer ) i could n't believe it once i heard it . 
  almost no one here does that , regardless if they work in professional fields for decades . 
  iirc many eu countries require that those days are taken . 
  only 76 % of workers here have pto . 
  16 % have paid maternity leave . 
  at least the non-professional japanese workers have rights . 
  labor here is considered to be mere privileged dependents , not a fact of life for most people . 
  that 's why they 're treated like shit here . 
  his parents were n't and he was born in south africa . 
  musk is only american in citizenship , business ethics , and hubris , which makes him 90 % pure american but not 100 % . 
  were there any differences between the ideology of the young turks of the later era to kemalism ? 
  would it really ?
