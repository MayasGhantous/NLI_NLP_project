  everyone loves you . 
  i just started doing that yesterday . 
  i was writing something and had to check on whether it is , `` the netherlands '' or simply `` netherlands '' . 
  in the end , i decided to henceforth say and write it without the , `` the '' . 
  i did not consider the s at the end . 
  what is your reasoning for leaving the s off ? 
  wow . 
  i woosh that had n't happened . 
  [ sliders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slider_ ( sandwich ) ) ... tapas ... 
  perfect match ? 
  wait . 
  the restaurant was there for only one day ? 
  dude , do n't take it so seriously . 
  its just a fun/mildly-amusing question . 
  also , your analogy does n't work . 
  no country/culture/cuisine will be offended or get their feeling hurt by you having a favorite . 
  i love orange marmalade . 
  thanks for the explanation and the laughs . 
  i do n't know what either of those things are . 
  it could have been worse : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0pxvc8mgdg, 
  sticks the noun or sticks the verb ? 
  i first thought , `` but where are you ? 
  you do n't have any flair . '', 
  then i thought , `` oh , yeah . 
  people are always the most dangerous , no matter where you go . '', 
  mmmmm , fudge . 
  that 's quite industrious of you . 
  and the u.s. and canada . 
  as i always say , trying to cram in too much within a given time/budget is very common . 
  that said , it really depends on what kind of visit you will be satisfied with . 
  if i had 15 days to visit those 5 cities ... * in planning , i usually devote one day to changing cities ( traveling time , checking in/out , finding stations/ports , finding your way to hotel/hostel , waiting ) . 
  that 's ~ 1/3 of the entire trip spoken for right off the bat . 
  i am down to 10 days . 
  * what do i want to do when i am in city ? 
  research the specific places you want to visit . 
  some places have enough depth to keep one busy for years while others can be well-appreciated within a couple hours . 
  one or two attractions in a day is enough for me . 
  i do n't know how to get to the places and i do n't like being rushed . 
  the places i want to see might be miles apart and some public transport systems are easier to figure out than others . 
  * traveling can be surprisingly exhausting . 
  be prepared to take a break from your fun . 
  some days , i just lounge in a cafe or my lodgings . 
  * an often-overlooked facet of traveling is the return home . 
  after a whirlwind of trains , planes , and automobiles , i need some time to decompress . 
  this means getting into my normal routines before i have to go back to work/school/friends , etc. 
  for most people , making an international flight the day before having to return to work would not turn out well . 
  do yourself a favor and give yourself 2 days off at the end of your trip . 
  overall , remember that the time and money you have for the trip is yours to spend however you like . 
  have fun with it . 
  if you like that , try * neverwhere * by neil gaiman . 
  shieldwall !, 
  never say never . 
  i think `` the netherlands '' should be `` netherland '' ; and that 's how i refer to it now . 
  i 've had several conversations with dutch persons about it , here on reddit , and many of them agreed with me that it is/would be a better name . 
  sounds jamaican . 
  they probably thought amsterdam is the only city in netherland , and since they were in a city , they must be in amsterdam . 
  that too should not be consumed with potato . 
  i 'll just leave this here : http://www.videobash.com/video_show/key-amp-peele-ratatouille-2967931, 
  nothing ... until you eat it with potato . 
  damn . 
  is there anything left ? 
  that must be a different variety of asparagus than is typical here . 
  i 've flown into and out of north america , europe , and asia many times . 
  people do this everywhere . 
  i looked it up on youtube . 
  yes , i have heard the 2001 version , but i had no clue what the title was . 
  yeah , i am not into music at all . 
  never heard of it . 
  as usual , i am not a part of everyone . 
  i know , right ? 
  i do n't think people understood the question . 
  hello captain ? , ? 
  a loaf of bread , an omelette with cheese ? 
  underwear ? 
  little menu, 
  yes , exactly !, 
  agreed . 
  this is the worst . 
  socializing is one thing . 
  asking people for their personal information is another . 
  i agree that the above situation is invasive , but that does n't mean we should never talk to people we do n't know . 
  its the same here . 
  places charge high-end prices for medium-grade food and service ; and people pay for it because consumers are no longer savvy . 
  lol your username and '' ... no more burgers ... '' . 
  1 year `` ask the u.k. how it feels . '', 
  there 's nothing silly about knowing what you want and going for just that . 
  lol excellent job . 
  i lack the knowledge to make as good a version as you did . 
  \u266b in west serbia born and raised ... \u266b, 
  72 % 4:47 i feel as though i should have done better . 
  i do n't frequent this sub * that * much , but i have always been interested in geography and i 've traveled in europe . 
  i even took a geography course in college . 
  the balkans area has been fuzzy in my mind since the '90s , even though the current borders have been in place long enough for me to remember them . 
  just some fyi : * disneyland is in california and walt disney world is in florida . 
  * it was likely an alligator attraction . 
  there are some native crocodiles , but they are far less common . 
  hahaha !, 
  that taxi driver reference . 
  just like here . 
  the last name , `` doe '' is actually pretty rare .
