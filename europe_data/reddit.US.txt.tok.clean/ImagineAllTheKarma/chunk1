my mistake , i thought he had hijacked it like in berlin . 
  even if you cant get a gun , pulling a knife on a truck driver will have the same effect . 
  even within sunni islam there is conflict, 
  i mean if i was a truck driver and someone put a gun in my face i 'd hand over the keys/code . 
  maybe some sort of remote kill switch so the driver could shut off the engine after the takeover . 
  i took [ this photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vrel6un.jpg ) of snowplows filled with sand blocking the entrance to the st patricks day parade in chicago last month . 
  [ new york did the same ] ( http://abc7ny.com/news/sand-filled-trucks-to-line-macys-parade-route-to-prevent-terror-attack/1618454/ ) for their thanksgiving parade . 
  man that is fucked up to read . 
  something about seeing jihadis lay out their beliefs clearly in english really fucks with me, 
  from the wiki article it says he was targeting immigrants . 
  so it seems like it was terrorism , just not islamic terrorism . 
  it 's fucked up how each attack shocks/surprises me less and less . 
  seriously , i may have some beef with hardliners of all religions but islam seems to be the worst of the bunch every time, 
  they also define fascists as anyone to the right of marx, 
  i 've always wondered about people driving manual cars on right side , it would seem more difficult shifting with your non-dominant hand, 
  i wonder why that is, 
  but you guys still have a much [ lower rate of traffic deaths ] ( http://www.complex.com/sports/2013/02/germanys-fatal-accident-rate-is-less-than-half-of-ours-despite-driving-at-155-mph ) than us, 
  how so ? 
  what country are you in ? 
  in the states if you get a dui expect to pay 5-10 grand in the states, 
  it would n't suprise me . 
  some of the most popular guns in the us are made overseas, 
   and made in the us ? 
  porn and cheesburgers, 
  seriously , i 'm all for reducing our military but lets not pretend there are no benefits from the way things are now, 
  even in the days after 9/11 the pentagon was n't talked about nearly as much as the attacks in new york . 
  on any other day it would be front page news but because of what happened at the world trade center so many news outlets did n't cover the pentagon attack im depth . 
  the [ pentagon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_airlines_flight_77 ) ( basically where our military command works ) was also attacked on 9/11 , but it was overshadowed by what happened in new york, 
  seriously , everyone will point to oklahoma city , breivik or the mosque shooting in quebec and say `` right wingers are just as big a threat '' while ignoring that islamic terror is far more prevalent, 
  being murdered is rare , being murdered in a terrorist attack is even more rare, 
  i think you 're mistaken , the 1993 wtc bombing was on [ february 26th ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_world_trade_center_bombing ), 
  who said that ? 
  good thing this guy decided to attack the armed ones, 
  looks like a guy ran down people in a car and then was shot by police edit : looks like two separate incidents , a knife attack and the car attack . 
  til bic is german, 
  its a damn good thing terrorists seem to be getting dumber, 
  i mean germany does have the strongest voice in the eu post brexit, 
  a couple weeks ago someone ran into a crowd in new orleans , it was all over the news for an hour before we realized it was a drunk driver and not terrorism . 
  god damn it belgium, 
  maybe it got lost in the mail, 
  you think thats bad ? 
  someone has to open and count all of them, 
  i mean we do n't shoot each other while were high ( on weed ), 
   why the huge drop in russia ? 
  russian jews were protected by the holocaust , right ? 
  did they immigrate after ww2 ? 
  when the ussr fell a huge amount of jews left for israel/america , it actually changed the demographics in israel, 
  it 's pretty scary how often i see people supporting them . 
  i 'm not defending the ira and they are a terrorist organization . 
  now with that said i would n't say their as bad as isis . 
  the ira did somewhat try to reduce death from their attacks , isis does the opposite, 
  i watched the video and only heard one shot, 
  or hell just revoke their citizenship and do n't let them return from syria/iraq, 
  [ he definitely used to outright deny it ] ( http://dparchives.library.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/pennsylvania?a=d&amp;d=tdp19911122-01.2.24 ) but recently gave a [ half assed retraction ] ( https://tytnetwork.com/2016/04/22/rescinding-daily-pennsylvanian-article/ ), 
  but only because the queen chooses not to right ? 
   adolf niggler i just burst out laughing at that, 
  the same iran that funds terrorist groups ? 
  iran funded hamas ( sunni ) until just a couple years ago when hamas refused to fight with iran in syria, 
  i watched a simulation on where the us/ussr nukes would be fired if it went hot and both sides were hitting the germany, 
  and a higher chance dying in a car crash on the way to the airport than dying in a plane crash, 
  probably less danger in the immediate aftermath of an attack , everyone 's on edge and more vigilant, 
  i mean shawarma is pretty damn good, 
  you 're right about new york i have n't been there in a few years ( since before isis became a threat ) but i remember reading about how on new years eve they had [ heavily armed officers patrolling the streets ] ( http://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/12/30/a57e178d-5142-4488-bf7a-c78750c089d8/resize/620x/71dac9387ff6d258c4c42b31d19917a9/rtx2wvo6.jpg ) but even where i live in chicago i rarely if ever see officers dressed any more `` militaristic '' than [ this ] ( https://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/no-slug/6498fa2e45f7e85579506b1c785dd09c.jpg ), 
  i think israel is a much better comparison than mexico . 
  mexico has areas where the cartels have basically taken over . 
  i do n't see islamic groups taking over entire towns in france like that, 
  we only hear about the intelligence failures , attacks are stopped all the time but barley are reported on, 
  it 's pretty weird honestly . 
  i read that most airports in western europe have armed soldiers patrolling which is something i havent seen here since the weeks after 9/11, 
  it 's not just europe ... 
  i kept my support of trump hidden irl and sometimes i wonder if i 've ever discussed politics with someone who did the same and we both bullshitted about voting for clinton, 
  and also attack an armed soldier with your machete, 
  he spoke with trudeau over the phone but did n't make a public statement, 
   dumbest terrorist ever . 
  that has to go to [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_new_york_and_new_jersey_bombings ) guy set off pipe bombs , pressure cooker bombs , had a gun and managed to kill 0 people . 
  he was caught because the phones he used on his bombs were connected to his own family plan . 
  he was so incompetent isis refused to claim him . 
   it gives you the time to react , draw and aim your weapon , fire and gives enough distance for the attacker to fall to the ground before cutting you . 
  i think the soldier was wounded too , not seriously but the attacker did manage to get him with the knife before being shot, 
  i mean he basically did do that, 
  maybe rob a bank or something, 
  drug war is the biggest contributor imo, 
  this looks way more fun than the internet tbh ... 
  i 'd believe that but the police did n't find a gun in the trunk . 
  i doubt he 'd be able to throw the gun very far after shooting himself, 
  charlie hebdo , and boston bombers escaped their initial attacks, 
  dna and fingerprints inside the truck are the police 's best bet . 
  also the guy who did this is believed to have a gun , i would n't be surprised if he attempted another attack in the next few days either, 
  in america it 's the same thing . 
  if a crazy guy is running at you with a knife you can shoot him , but you ca n't go to the guys house the next day and kill him, 
  from what i 've read , guns and carry permits are easy to get in the czech republic , assuming you have one and a terrorists starts shooting people are you not able to defend yourself with your gun already ? 
  so does this law change anything ? 
  or is it just cementing the existing laws as a right in the constitution ? 
  also alerts others that the officer needs help, 
  but as a passenger it makes 0 difference . 
  we also dont have as many budget airlines, 
   best case scenario the stuff goes to some warring faction in libya/syria or something my guess is its pretty easy to get weapons like that in libya/syria anyway . 
  i 'd bet whoever stole them plans on using them within the eu ... 
  communists are pro-gun until they run the show ... 
  i just watched a documentary on him and breivik was something else .
