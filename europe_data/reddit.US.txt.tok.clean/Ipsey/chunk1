a group of slovakian erasmus students at my school have invited me back to bratislava to have a kofola with them . 
  i 'm sorely tempted . 
  - one of the girls went running through our dyrehaven at night , and got scared because she heard noises and thought it was the vodonik . 
  she said it made her run faster . 
  - she also had this awesome collection of liquor . 
  there was a particular herbed vodka drink that came in a dark bottle and was absolutely amazing . 
  - oh my god ; bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky - sheep cheese dumplings with bacon . 
  about the best thing i ever put in my mouth . 
  i 'm an international student here in denmark , from the us . 
  my eu friends do n't pay for school . 
  there are chinese students who pay . 
  i do n't pay , and i get su - but i lived here for a while before i started school . 
  the requirement with my type of immigration was that i had to be married for three years before my education was paid for ; and this was the same for the three other americans in my class . 
  http://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to_dk/studies/post_secondary_education.htm this is the basic requirements to study in denmark . 
  its more like we do n't have ac ; we live in giant ovens designed to retain heat here in denmark . 
  some days it 's just cooler to sit outside than inside because of breezes . 
  yesterday i sat on my porch and drank gin punch until it got cool , then went into my well lit house and melted . 
  i grew up in texas , so i 'm no stranger to heat . 
  ... well damn . 
  no wonder my husband keeps everything out of sight of the windows . 
  * well ... * hyperbole aside . 
  we do have things like farmer 's markets and ethnic markets and specialty bakeries . 
  i 'll concede that , and edit the post . 
  i 'm having memory and word issues right now , so when i get on a roll , i tend to go with whatever comes at hand . 
  there 's one street in the city where i live where you start at the center of town , and you can walk past a two ethnic stores , a cheese shop , three bakeries , a fish store , and if you go on the right day at the right time you can hit both the city market and the town square market . 
  i can take the bus to get my hair done at 8 , be done by 9 , walk down through the center towards city hall and have all my shopping done by 10 , and be home before 11 , all without ever going to a grocery store - but there is one on the way home from the bus stop , if i 've forgotten my milk . 
  i 've never had that luxury living in the states . 
  i would either have to live immediately close to the store ; or drive from one side of the city to the next in something that would take hours of errands to accomplish ( i lived in dallas ; so i 'm up to 6 million ) . 
  i love that sort of sprawl and the fun and the business of dallas , do n't get me wrong , but i do n't know how to * find * half the things in dallas ( i lived for half a year near a huge bollywood theater in irving before i had any idea it was even there ) . 
  and if you want to find some thing in fort worth , that 's a day trip , almost , because now you 're in another big city that you 're not familiar with . 
  hey , you 're in luck . 
  i talked to a of mine up in vienna for advice on your situation . 
  he says you go to the supermarket and check for the ama g\u00fctesiegel . 
  he says most supermarkets have butchers in them . 
  he usually only buys the fresh stuff but he says the frozen stuff is usually only schnitzel or stuff that 's not bad but not as good as normal meat . 
  as for vegetables he says that it depends on the vegetables - the discount supermarkets have good quality but you have to look through the stuff . 
  unless you want something extravagant ( `` extravagant ? '', 
  i asked . 
  `` like gold plated carrots and diamond encrusted cucumbers ? 
  platinum potatoes ? '' ), 
  like the stuff on master chef and hell 's kitchen . 
  so yeah , it 's gon na be more expensive than in western europe , but i was talking to my hungarian friend today and she buys most long term things in hungary and only does day to day shopping here in denmark , and my norwegian and swedish friends come down to denmark to buy alcohol because booze is cheaper here , but we go to germany to buy alcohol and soda and wine because it 's even cheaper there ( and it 's a short hop across the border for me ) and i get to hang out with all of them and they bring me chocolate . 
  i really should n't post on reddit when i 'm sick :d, 
  not really . 
  i did the [ slow carb diet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slow-carb_diet ) for a while and it was n't that difficult . 
  so like i said in my above post , we bulk buy , and that includes our meats . 
  we buy chicken breasts in something like a 5 kilo box ( i think , maybe i 'm off on the weight - i just checked and it has 2 bags of 2750 grams of frozen chicken ) ; then we buy cans of tomatoes in 20 cans per case , and we bulk buy beans ( that 's my lentils you 're sniffing / r/frugal ) and frozen vegetables in huge bags ( 2000 grams of vegetables ) . 
  it 's not amazing variety but it works and it keeps you fed ; but we come out on top with the spices , and with enough combinations of meat + veg + bean you come out okay . 
  we had a couple of recipes that we still have in our regular rotation from that time period ( i 'm currently extremely sick and do n't have the energy to maintain that sort of diet , so that 's why we 're off it ) . 
  some of the ones we still eat ( sorry for the abbreviated recipe , this is off the top of my head and with my shit memory from being sick ) : ** tomato , bacon , and bean soup : ** 1 ) cut up fresh tomatoes , roast under bacon and with spices and olive oil . 
  once roasted , separate out tomatoes and bacon . 
  reserve bacon for topping . 
  2 ) use canned ( or leftover cooked beans - this is probably better ) and blend roasted tomatoes and a can of cooked tomatoes together with the beans . 
  blend until smooth . 
  3 ) pour blended mixture into stock ( or water with boullion cubes ) and heat . 
  4 ) when heated and spiced to taste , top with bacon and serve . 
  * ( if your diet does not allow beans , leave them out . 
  this tomato soup is delicious with bacon . 
  also bacon is delicious with tomato soup . 
  also bacon is delicious . 
  ) * ** tuna salad ** what ? 
  tuna salad ? 
  but that requires bread !, 
  lettuce wraps , bitches . 
  put whatever dressing you require in your tuna salad , as per your diet 's requirements . 
  i like a little whole grain mustard , lemon , and oil , but i like things on the sharp side . 
  my husband likes remoulade , because he 's a dane and danes put that on everything ( sometimes i like it on my tuna salad but do n't tell [ him ] ( / u/thedanishdude ) because he hoards his like some crazy viking guy . 
  you need tuna frozen peas onion red beans spices dressing dice onion , drain and wash beans , rinse in warm water to unfreeze them , drain tuna and give the tuna water to your cat cause she 's going '' * neer , neer , lady , neer , you opened something in a can so it must be mine !, 
  * '' add in your spices and dressing , and mix that all up together so that it makes something to your tastes . 
  tuna is a highly subjective thing . 
  ** lazy lentil soup ** people will hate me for doing this , but this is what i make when i 'm feeling uncreative and i 'm tired . 
  i brown a package of ground beef , then i throw a boullion on top of it and pour a bag of lentils on it . 
  then when the lentils seem soft , i throw a bag of broccoli mix on it . 
  then i spice it to taste . 
  then i eat that for two days . 
  i wish i had lentils right now , because i feel really tired and uncreative but i 'm out cause i 've had a lot of those days recently . 
  but you can still do that with no lentils . 
  i dunno how keto and paleo feel about lentils ( i know how frugal feels about lentils cause they wo n't stop talking about it , amirite ? 
  but seriously , it 's kind of an eh food for me ) . 
  beyond that , pork is super cheap here and they practically throw it at you . 
  ( salmon is cheaper in norway , where they were packing it in our suitcases as we were leaving . 
  '' * oh you 're going ? 
  no , i do n't know where the reindeer sausage and side of salmon came from ... * '' ) i dunno how paleo/keto feels about certain meats , but some things are easier to find than others . 
  meat tends to be seasonal too , some things you can get cheaper than others . 
  duck comes out during the winter , turkey around thanksgiving ( and by god we had some gorgeous turkey breasts at thanksgiving , which is apparently when the americans came over and brought advertising to denmark ) , venison and lamb around spring ( ? 
  ) , and ymmv on other things . 
  another thing is to try shopping different places for different things . 
  i used to live across from a butcher ( they closed it down ) : ) so we used to get crazy good deals on sausage and they 'd have barbecues in the summer . 
  fresh fish is cheaper by the harbor than at the places in town . 
  the chicken farmer might give you a cheaper deal than the grocery store . 
  shop around , maybe ? 
  i do n't like to settle for what 's in front of me and i 'm big on hunting to find what i like ( lol , paleo right ? ), 
  so if i want something , i go out and find it . 
  i hope you find what you 're looking for :d, 
  the best thing is we 're out of the [ food deserts . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/food_desert ) when i was n't driving in the states i would pick places to live near grocery stores so i could walk , otherwise i would have to rely on people to give me rides to the store , or schedule grocery visits around my parents . 
  i talked my mom into getting a sams club membership with me so she would drive us , but i would pay for the yearly membership . 
  she kept it after i moved here , so i guess she liked the benefit of bulk buying . 
  i miss that , mostly - there 's some things i feel we have to have as staples , so we buy those as often as we can at the big big grocery store here in denmark ( 20 cans of tomato sauce ? 
  20kg of rice ?
