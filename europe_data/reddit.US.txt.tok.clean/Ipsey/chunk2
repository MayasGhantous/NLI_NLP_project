  ginormous bags of frozen vegetables ? 
  yes please ! ), 
  because they never go bad and we eat them regularly enough that it 's worth the cost of storing them . 
  other things , day to day stuff , i appreciate the corner grocery store for . 
  i like being able to go to my store if i 'm out of milk or if i need peppers for dinner or if i get a wild idea to have my husband make frikadeller for dinner but we do n't have the meat for it ( he 's best at danish food and shut up those things are delicious ) . 
  the best thing though is the specialty markets - the cheese shops and the bakeries and the fish markets and the green grocers and the little ethnic markets . 
  we ~ ~ absolutely do not have those ~ ~ * these things can be difficult to find * in the states and they are gorgeous . 
  i love walking down town in my city and being able to do an around the world tour without leaving the city and without breaking the bank - a big bag of fresh strawberries from the green market on wednesday , some good danish havarti from the cheesemarket , a nice side of smoked salmon from the fish market , plus a nice fresh baked rugbr\u00f8d and a french bread from the baker , then down to the spanish store for a fuet , the turkish market for some dates and figs , across to the asian market for some cherry juice for me and some mango juice for my husband , then it 's on the bus and home ; and all in the time to be back by lunch . 
  i mean , and that 's just here in the tiny town i live in denmark . 
  go to somewhere bigger like copenhagen , oslo , berlin , amsterdam , brussels , london , barcelona - i mean your options are greater and your possibilities are endless . 
  ( ps - spain , i think i could live off of cava , turron , and bacalao for the rest of my life , just sayin . 
  i mean , it might be a short life but i would die happy ) . 
  sk\u00e5l !, 
  yes !, 
  haha , mothafuckaaaassss !, 
  i belong here like sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d and tuborg , bitches !, 
  i saw , just wanting to make sure i read it right :d maybe my question was n't worded so well . 
  thank you for making it clearer . 
  does it show our one wolf in danemark ? 
  i am subscribed to / r/denmark and i 've posted there a few times . 
  thank you for the help though . 
  i wrote half a dozen articles in preparation for my last test based on articles in / r/denmark , actually . 
  i just do n't think they would care so much about my opinion pieces . 
  native english speaker - i speak `` grocery store spanish '' which got me by in barcelona recently , and danish . 
  my mother is puerto rican , so my comprehension is much greater than my ability to speak it , aside from my semester of collegiate spanish . 
  i know enough to get around but not enough to hold conversations , but technically , it 's my second language , from growing up in a bilingual household . 
  i know danish because i moved to denmark a few years ago after marrying a dane , and i am wrapping up my governmental danish lessons in november of this year . 
  i just passed my level 3 ( collegiate level ) module 4 ( beginning advanced ) test with high marks in listening , speaking , and reading , and low marks in writing , but i have a few months to improve before my final test . 
  i studied japanese for five years in school but it 's been years since i had a practical application for it , so i 've forgotten most of what i learned . 
  i did get to use it a little in barcelona too , with the hotel guests where we were staying . 
  that is way more than i ever knew about dr pepper before . 
  including the tomato bits . 
  i prefer the sucrose one for the sweeter flavors , plus the high fructose corn syrup can get a bit ... heavy after a while . 
  i can only drink about half a bottle at a time anyway . 
  my husband calls it a `` funky cola '' too , but he likes it when we have it in the house . 
  huh . 
  did n't know that . 
  haha - thanksgiving in denmark . 
  they have almost all of the traditional stuff for thanksgiving dinners out here and make a big show of it , but it 's not a ` thing ' for danes . 
  previous years we did an all out full dinner like we do in the states , but this year we did a danesgiving pie , like a shepherd 's pie , i saw someone make on reddit , and it came out fabulous . 
  i have the pictures from the event here . 
  http://imgur.com/a/k5agj now i could be completely mistaken about the origin of this beverage and have completely misread the label , and i admit to that fault . 
  i bought it in denmark last summer at a 7-11 . 
  normally we get our dr pepper imported from england , and i do n't know what the deal is with the eastern european stuff but it tastes different from the english stuff . 
  i made my own stuffing for danesgiving this year that was better than stovetop . 
  it was really easy too . 
  brb going to london ( maybe paris ), 
  it 's not quite the same , though . 
  i had a slovenian dr pepper and it had lemonade on the label and it tasted funky . 
  i have a picture of it somewhere . 
  oh man yes . 
  real , proper kraft macaroni and cheese and some proper fritos for frito pie , or even better ? 
  so delicious . 
  ca n't fucking find goldfish over here either , goddamnit . 
  haha , nope . 
  it just [ is n't behind the counter ] ( http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/12/111208_ex_drugstore.jpg.crop.rectangle3-large.jpg ) in the states . 
  [ pharmacies ] ( http://sharpsburgpharmacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/prescriptionareadropoff.jpg ) tend to be larger on a whole , and tend to be a function of a larger store . 
  a ** drugstore ** , which is like a small grocery store that sells makeup and a few perishable goods and candy and small , useful items , but primarily prescription medication and over the counter medication ( which is usually out and readily available for people to pick and pay for at the normal registers , not at the pharmacist counter ) . 
  a portion of this does get stolen , but most people just pay for it . 
  most ** supermarkets ** have pharmacies in them , which is what makes a supermarket different from a grocery store ( some also do other things like tires and sell tvs , like walmart , costco , and sam 's ) . 
  they also have over the counter products . 
  over the counter medicines are cheaper in the states too , and easier to access , so if you wanted to , you could buy [ 25 bottles of cough syrup ] ( http://www.violentacres.com/archives/193/what-would-happen-if-you-bought-25-bottles-of-nyquil/ ) and nobody would really care . 
  you can also get them in [ larger quantities ] ( http://m.cvs.com/img?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cvs.com%2fbizcontent%2fmerchandising%2fproductimages%2flarge%2f5042816031.jpg&amp;ttl=30d ) . 
  my parents send me a package one a year with all the medicines that i need because it costs them about $ 20 for the year and it can cost me upwards of 300 dkk every four months . 
  on top of that , one of the medicated hand creams i use for my allergies is only available with a prescription . 
  it 's taken me three years to actually get a prescription for it , and it 's .1 % and the strength i get from the states and use on a daily basis is 1 % , and comes with aloe and lavender in it . 
  one of the medications i use to treat my migranes , which i have taken to my neurologist and shown to them , is not available here at all . 
  they just laugh at me and tell me to keep importing it from the states . 
  one of the bulk sizes lasts me over two years , and costs $ 15 . 
  or i could pay monthly for a prescription here . 
  this , again , is not good or bad , it 's just different . 
  the flip side of this equation , is that my prescription medication for the stuff i super need to take , every day , or i stop breathing and i stop being able to function like an adult , is a fraction of what i was paying in the states . 
  i paid over $ 3000 annually for my medical care , including medication , doctor visits and hospital stays , for issues related to epilepsy , migranes , asthma , and other conditions , and i was fortunate enough to have medical insurance . 
  i pay * less * than 10 % of that here in denmark . 
  the * only * thing i pay for is medication , whether over the counter , or by prescription ( and dental , but that 's separate ) . 
  that 10 % is a fraction of the real costs associated with that medication , so even if my source in the states dried up , i 'd still be satisfied with what i have and would n't be complaining . 
  just think of it as more remoulade for you , man . 
  mostly it 's been healthcare issues . 
  i 'm used to the american system , where i can just throw money at my problem until i get an answer or it goes away . 
  i am a student , but i do n't have to get financial support because i am married to a dane . 
  i did have a hard time understanding how su worked , because i had to apply through a gymnasiet for one course and my academy for another su when i first started . 
  there was a lot of confusion with that . 
  i 've had tons of trouble with the language school in my area and trying to get my exams processed . 
  i took my test last week and i got an immediate result on my speaking test but i have n't heard on my written test . 
  i passed my hearing and reading tests a month ago . 
  this is the final test i need to complete my residency requirement , and my government sponsored period ends in april , so i 'm super antsy about this . 
  the response i 've gotten from them was `` we do n't know . '', 
  udl\u00e6ndingrestyrelsen has been nice , they just take a really , really long time , which has made me paranoid . 
  i live in esbjerg so i 've never had to deal with them in person . 
  jobcenter assigned me to a job finding program that has twice sent me out to the muslim ghetto across town from where i live . 
  and though i have absolutely nothing against muslims or ghettos ( when i lived in the states , i lived and worked in close contact with both ) ; it does make me feel that there 's something of a ` one size fits all ' approach to these sort of programs . 
  regarding schools - in the states , i worked in pharmacy for five years . 
  i do n't want to move to copenhagen for school , and the only healthcare school in town rejected me three times because my danish was n't good enough . 
  the third time i applied they accepted my husband . 
  i have since been accepted into a different program . 
  i help him out with some of the subjects he takes in school . 
  he tells me that i speak better danish than some of the people that he goes to school with . 
  despite what it sounds like , i 'm not really complaining - in the end , i think i 'm happier with the program that i 'm in now than with any of the other options that i would have been set up with otherwise . 
  it 's been an uphill climb to get where i am , and i 've had to do a lot of navigating in a system i really do n't understand and i do n't have anyone to explain to me . 
  but i really like where i 'm at now , i like my teachers and my class mates , and the place where i live now .
