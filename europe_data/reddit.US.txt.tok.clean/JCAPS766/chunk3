  right ? 
  why you heff to be mehd ? 
  for anyone wondering , that 's a joke about russian nhl goaltender ilya bryzgalov , who was hilarious in a documentary series two years ago on the leadup to the nhl winter classic . 
  and an american chiming in because he thinks he 's entitled to an opinion ? 
  russia does not treat prostitution as illegal . 
  i find that to be a very convincing argument . 
  thank you for helping me understand, 
  how petulant and pathetic . 
  what , are they worried that gayness from the open air will infect the dairy supply and turn russian children homosexual ? 
  dammit . 
  i need to learn \u043c\u0430\u0442 better . 
  this is the memorial of the brest fortress , which was one of the first places struck by operation barbarossa in wwii . 
  the fortress held for over a week against incredibly fierce german assault , while all along the front , other soviet forces were being completely overwhelmed . 
  isolated resistance in the fortress lasted for weeks after that . 
  it holds significance to russians and belorusians akin to pearl harbour for the us . 
  yeah , i 've heard that the moscow neighbourhood in riga is a rather unpleasant place . 
  riga is a wonderful city !, 
  western lies !, 
  you foreigners do n't understand russia !, 
  my mistake . 
  i thought that russia was simply going to back out of giving ukraine a sweet price for its gas , making it far more expensive to run the country in the winter . 
  1 ) they fear it leading to aligning with nato . 
  this possibility was quite real when bush was president , but kiev eventually decided they did n't want to pursue a pathway to nato . 
  get a taste of the sweetness , though , who knows what can happen ? 
  maybe , like the rest of the former warsaw pact/ussr , they 'll want nato membership to secure their future in the euro-atlantic political and economic community , permanently and certifiably free from any future fears of armed russian bullying . 
  2 ) ukraine ( specifically kiev ) is the ancestral heart of the russian people . 
  the nation came from the kievan rus ' . 
  a very large portion ( concentrated in the east of the country ) of the population is ethnically russian . 
  millions of russian sons shed their blood for ukraine 's freedom from the fascists . 
  for ukraine to turn towards the west instead of toward her ` russian heart ' would be a massive slap in the face ; a profound insult to the russian national mythology and pride . 
  3 ) unlike most of the rest of the russian export market ( for products excluding natural resources ) , ukraine has a pretty decent and developed economy . 
  to lose privileged access to it would be troublesome . 
  russia sees the expansion of western influence , and the crumbling of their own , as a real threat to their long-term relevance as a global power , and when you get down to it , their security . 
  the russian endgame is to maintain a ` sphere of privileged interest . ', 
  i guess kind of like declaring the monroe doctrine over most of the former soviet union , and wishing that they could over the balkans and the countries of the former warsaw pact . 
  also , the occupants of the kremlin are conniving , stubborn , petulant little bitches . 
  source : studies russia and us-russian relations, 
  holy shit !, 
  my post made it to / r/bestof !, 
  kinda . 
  you clearly have n't been to eastern europe, 
  a newly-constructed ( 2011 ) supermarket collapsed , killing , so far , 54 people in latvia 's capital . 
  not the time or place . 
  which market was this ? 
  was this the big one made of zepplin hangars near the train/bus station ? 
  i was in riga a few years ago , and i have a feeling i 've been to this market ( even if it is n't the one i described ) . 
  * edit : nevermind , this one was relatively new . 
  christ almighty ... 
  despite my love for the country , russia drives me right up the wall sometimes . 
  til scandinavian ethnic politics !, 
  amusing . 
  it 's a particularly dreary former soviet republic , replete with an autocrat , all sorts of corruption , and repression . 
  they also have significant hydrocarbon reserves , and a long-standing conflict with armenia over the nagorno-karabakh region . 
  good . 
  i think his point was absolutely correct . 
  soviets who fought for the freedom and independence of poland my balls . 
  ah , that shitty soviet architecture !, 
  so is `` \u043a\u043e\u0431\u044b\u043b '' just another word for horse ? 
  i 've only heard `` \u043b\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0434\u044c '', 
  russian has an interesting phrase for lazing/fucking around/doing nothing : < < \u0445\u0443\u0451\u043c \u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0438 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c   `` to hit a pear tree with one 's penis to make the pears fall down . '', 
  surprisingly , when i was abroad in russia and eastern europe , i did not have a single beer that i disliked . 
  indeed , i had one beer in ukraine that was the best beer i had ever tasted , but that was largely because of the circumstances that preceded its purchase . 
  a lesson i hope all of you learn : alcohol is , strictly speaking , poison . 
  if you 're going to drink poison , it might as well taste good . 
  there is never good reason to drink bad alcohol , especially with european alcohol prices . 
  if you ca n't afford something worth drinking , you do n't need to get drunk that badly . 
  trust me . 
  there is worse than pbr . 
  you 're sure it was n't kvass , right ? 
  til, 
  i think he should be prosecuted for having sex with minors . 
  it is part of a carefully-cultivated image, 
  in italy ? 
  learn how to swim , learn how to save your own life . 
  that simple . 
  there are the potato jokes ... 
  i visited riga last summer . 
  i was able to get around everywhere with my russian and english . 
  riga is quite a nice city , and it has a western european feel to it . 
  that being said , there 's a great deal of poverty , distress , and stagnation . 
  what i know of moldova is not good . 
  they have serious , serious problems with sex trafficking , corruption , the flight of the country 's best and brightest ( or most anyone with much skill ) , and just general decrepitness . 
  one of my friends spent time there , and she told me how -- especially with the women -- the people just do n't have much respect for themselves . 
  i 've also read really troubling things about the sex trafficking out of there . 
  families send their girls off with ostensibly trustworthy people to find work/education elsewhere in europe , and they 're forced into sex slavery . 
  really rough stuff . 
  ` prostitutes ' implies they 're in the trade willingly . 
  your point is that the soviet union was once a genocidal , culture-destroying monstrosity . 
  so , , , okay , what are you saying ? 
  done and done !, 
  care to come aboard ?
