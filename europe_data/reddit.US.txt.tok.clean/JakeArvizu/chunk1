which is why i always go for an abundance of mountain troops in hearts of iron . 
  incorrect . 
  he has his fans but he definitely is n't beloved by all or anything . 
  a lot of people dislike his schtick . 
  the mountains are the only critique i 'd give . 
  they look more flat or drawn on a tolkien map . 
  no offense but your opinion as a reader does n't matter much . 
  if someone told me they as a reader looked into 9/11 and they found that jet fuel does n't melt steel beams does n't make it historically significant . 
  it 's a book based on widely discounted theories and conjectures . 
  it 's all maybe this and maybe that would of happened , obviously i ca n't argue with hypotheticals or change your mind . 
  for me though i 'm going to place my faith in the historical community . 
  you can read countless books about countless topics does n't make a valid point . 
  if someone is discussing a book about holocaust denial that is widely discounted by historians do i have to read it and make my own opinion before i say holocaust denial is stupid . 
  `` suvorov 's view that a soviet invasion of germany was imminent in 1941 is not sharedby most historians '' '' summarising the western scholars ' opinion on icebreaker hugh ragsdale concludes that the book is `` generally considered discredited '' by now , [ 7 ] whereas jonathan haslam notes that suvorov 's claims `` would be comical were it not taken so seriously '' . 
  i do n't claim moral high ground ? 
  first of all i am not my government just like you are not yours . 
  how is it so hard to realize the fact of the matter that karremans was at the very least complicit in the rounding up and separation of muslims . 
  as far as the ground level failure i 'd say the blame starts somewhere around karremans or morillon . 
  soldiers for the most part follow orders . 
  not like one lone dutch blue beret was going to muster the troops and lead an assault against the do n't think you can blame anyone for that . 
  the only thing i find unacceptable is their level of complicity and karremans completely inappropriate handling of the situation . 
  a helping hand , you have to be kidding me . 
  they were all but marching them to their death . 
  is holding the door open for jews as they entered the holocaust chambers considered giving them a helping hand ? 
  unbelievable . 
  i do n't think they were too appreciative of that * helping * hand . 
  answer me this , why did they have to help mladic though . 
  standing down and not fighting clearly overmatched opponent is one thing the rounding up and orginization of non combatants ** with ** your ** enemy ** is another . 
  where 's the answer for that . 
  hell it 's better to be taken as an unwilling pow or hostage than do what karremans did . 
  he complied with mladic and showed him amity along with directing his troups to round up muslims and help separate them . 
  that sounds like a level of complicity to me . 
  i do n't demand anything near the death of those soldiers . 
  i 'm not ignoring any of these facts . 
  you 're the one deflecting the issue . 
  i will outright acknowledge it to you , yes there should have been air strikes , yes their should have been support and the dutch were in a difficult position . 
  however at the end of the day they were soliders and they laid down their arms and sent civilians off to their deaths . 
  why are you so eager to deny that . 
  are you denying that they did n't play an active on site role in complying with the serbs ? 
  yes or no . 
  exactly there was something like ~ 800 dutch troops , do people actually think the u.n was going to let them just get lined up and slaughtered . 
  it would have been an unprecedented incident . 
  was karremans exchanging gifts with mladic and wishing him a safe journey ( off to slaughtering ) a part of those heroic acts of standing up to the serbs ? 
  what about the troops being complicit in the sorting of the men and woman while rounding them up , was that standing up ? 
  by not literally helping to round up then hand over the people to mladic and his forces ? 
  i disagree , no one is saying they needed to launch a full on spartan assault on mladics emplacements outside the city . 
  that 's just being naive . 
  what they could have done though is completely deny any support or semblance of amity towards the serbs . 
  force mladics hand , the u.n was n't going to strike first as clearly demonstrated by their failure to execute airstrikes , but that does n't mean they would have let the dutch be attacked or slaughtered at the hands of the serbs . 
  they would have cratered the serbs if they attacked . 
  face it mladic played a game of chicken and karremans folded . 
  oh come on you really think they had no clue what was going to happen to those citizens . 
  they were n't handing over militants they were handing over civilians , can civilians even be pow 's ? 
  that has to be a violation of the geneva convention . 
  and i 'm pretty sure the courts agreed after the dutch were sued . 
  how so . 
  yes they would . 
  or at least do n't be complicit in the war crime . 
  no shot on earth would mladic have ordered a full on assault and execution of all the dutch soldiers . 
  if they would have held their ground and denied them entry mladic would have stood down . 
  or else the u.n would wipe him off the face of the earth . 
  yea true kinda dumb comment in retrospect . 
  more like good job un . 
  it was a 100 % preventable . 
  when did i say i did n't want to see that . 
  i agree the u.s did n't do shit either . 
  just that there is a difference from failing to provide air support and this , skip to ( 3:20 ) https://youtu.be/2jf1yihmiy0 . 
  the dutchbat are clearly on camera literally helping in the orginization of the separation and rounding up of muslims , are you denying this ? 
  discussion of the event and denial of the absolute fact that it happened are to separate things . 
   if the us had provided air support the dutch would n't have needed to do nothing . 
  agreed we all failed the people , u.s included . 
  however the dutch were complicit with being on site and literally being complicit in loading/separating the citizens into the hands of mladic and his people under the orders of karremans . 
  as in there is literal footage of the dutch loading up citizens into mladics trucks and separating the woman from the men . 
  skip to about 2:40 , the blue helmets are clearly visible . 
  death of yugoslavia is the obvious one . 
  for a bit more nuanced look at the particular massacre watch the documentary srebrenica , a town betrayed . 
  goes into the failings of the u.n and the on site dutchbat . 
  we all really failed them . 
  we 're at fault too , everyone fucked up . 
  it 's just the dutch actively aided mladic in rounding up citizens off to their death . 
  a little different . 
  okay they did n't have the tools to fight that 's one thing . 
  being complicit in literally handing over innocent citizens including woman and children is another thing . 
  why did they need to do that . 
  at the very least remain spectators i suppose . 
  i so wish the u.n was n't so teethless . 
  then how about instead of firing they just say no we are n't going to hand over citizens to you . 
  mladic was bluffing , they handed over the citizens no two ways about it . 
  their job was to protect the people and if need be lay down their lives for them . 
  do n't become a soldier if you are n't willing to fight . 
  mladic would have never openly attacked the u.n it would have been suicide . 
  he planned on scaring the dutch into submission and it worked . 
  because of stuff like this https://youtu.be/-tqcqzdfnkc or this https://youtu.be/mnaleecbz-k, 
  mladic was n't going to attack the dutch . 
  they gave into him and quite literally handed people over to be murdered . 
  if they would have stood their ground it would n't have happened , there was n't going to be a battle . 
  mladic was n't dumb enough to take on the u.n, 
  there 'd be no reason to believe trump even would know about the wall in the first place . 
  that 's hardly a problem that 'd need attention from the owner . 
  more than likely whoever the local manager was .
