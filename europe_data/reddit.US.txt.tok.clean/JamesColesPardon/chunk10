  tragic , yes . 
  case closed ? 
  be afraid , citizen !, 
  give your intelligence services ( which run your governments ) ** more power ** !, 
  it is extremely suspect . 
  it is illegal to drive in the states without a license as well , although i 'm sure it is regulated differently among the 50 states/commenwealths . 
  same thing . 
  this is all too common in these kinds of things . 
  it happened with [ charlie hebdo ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/01/07/what-we-know-about-the-attack-on-charlie-hebdos-paris-office/ ) . 
  it even was reported on 9/11 [ if you can believe that ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-qyctzwv7c ) . 
  keep it up . 
  there 's more to this . 
  well , there 'd be dudes with guns , too . 
   a nation 's ( and therefore its government ) main obligation is the security of its citizens and its citizens alone . 
  in america our executives swear to uphold and defend the constitution , not the security if it 's citizens . 
  you could argue that they are * somewhat the same * , but there is a difference . 
   sometimes such security happens to align with the security of citizens of other nations . 
  however , in actual fact , in the case of say , poland , no number of foreign citizens should be worth more than one polish citizen . 
  some people are just worth more than others , eh ? 
  wait until that * second class of citizens * is no longer content . 
   nations should look after their own first . 
  when they fail to do so , they become failed states and no longer have a purpose . 
  if the government of a nation no longer looks out for the interests of that nation and its people , they no longer have a right to be the government of that nation . 
  period . 
  i agree . 
  which means reforms should be coming . 
  everywhere . 
  soon . 
  is there a list or database of all the * terorrist * acts in europe over the last 15 years ? 
  besides all the downvotes ? 
  stop arming and funding * rebels * in other soverign nations ? 
  assist democratically elected leaders with financing and infrastructure to promote economic growth and eventual financial independence ? 
  your turn . 
  i 'm just an arrogant american who sees what his government 's policies have done to the world after 9/11 and am increasingly worried that more of the same will continue . 
  especially now . 
   mass surveillance might not work but it is equally impossible to expect every attack to be caught . 
  nobody says this . 
  but when you have been spying on your own citizens for at least 2 years ( that we know about via snowden ) , and then ** this happens ** , of course there should be scrutiny for those that are violating numerous privacy rights if citizens without getting the job done . 
   that does not mean that intelligence officers are not doing their jobs . 
  umm . . 
  yes it does . 
  their job is to rob you of privacy in the name of security . 
  if they can not do that , then you have given up privacy for no gain . 
  at all . 
   just that there is far too much to process for anyone to do so effectively and the effective groups will organize without raising a single flag until the attack . 
  then maybe we should be focusing not on how to improve the security state , but a root cause analysis of the problem and take steps to mitigate it before it happens . 
  and you know what ? 
  sending aircraft carriers to syria ** will certainly not help the problem ** . 
  as a brown-haired dude - i am offended . 
  they think they do ( my original point ) . 
  ... they do ? 
  that does n't sound like a ** world ** doping agency then . 
  should n't the ** world doping agency ** know how to detect ** doping ** ? 
  sounds like an utter failure on their part . 
  not really . 
  pretty much as expected . 
  ah , but then what will get the eyeballs to * tune in * ? 
  how else are you supposed to sell ad time ? 
   yes , for a lot of people , but its hardly a significant majority . 
  ** they do n't want us to live in fear . 
  ** they should turn off the tv and stop reading the news then . 
  if it bleeds , it leads . 
  maybe goldman sachs ? 
  if you think senate republicans will refuse to vote for ratification of the ttp on partisan anti-obama grounds , i have a bridge to sell ya . 
  i am stating that the argument of :  you need 2/3 of the senate so it wo n't happen is not exactly correct , considering it is already established that 60 of the required 67 senators already seem receptive to this treaty ( which is secret and they have n't even seen it , mind you ) . 
   for a treaty to be ratified in ** the us the senate needs to give it a two-thirds majority which basically means it wo n't happen . 
  ** the president still decides foreign policy however , and they 've had the foresight to see that following international law is better for the country . 
  they were fine * just 6 months ago * to give the president and his trade representative * the authority * to negotiate the tpp , so this statement means `` basically '' nothing . 
  all your link states is there were no warning or distress calls before or after impact ( which we know ) . 
  we know that they were flying just above the threshold cleared ( 33k ) to fly above a * literal warzone * . 
  this implicates kiev as much as it implicates moscow or donetsk ( which is little to none ) . 
  as an american , i certainly do appreciate the slant that my media portrays , throwing non-referenced one-liners such as  reports suggest it was shot down by * pro-russian rebels * . 
  within the article itself . 
  it 's the same trick that got the americans to think saddam had someting to do with 9/11 . 
  same game . 
  what does the mh17 black box say ? 
  edit : of course i 'll get downvoted to shit in r/europe for being even slightly less * all-in with putin being the next hitler * compared to the lot of you . 
  not once in 4 years have i complained about downvotes - but some of you act like fucking children . 
  and that is all speculation anyway ( your post , that is ) . 
  it was positive when i saw it . 
  a shame you are being censored . 
  this post will be tough to top today . 
  bravo . 
  i dug it . 
  without the flair i would agree with you , though . 
  here 's a brief explanation - and full disclosure - i believe the open internet rules that the fcc in the us * adopted * is a strangely orweillian term - as they will eventually make the internet * less open * . 
  let 's see if i can elucidate this further . 
  a link to the fcc 's open internet rules ( [ pdf found here ] ( https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/fcc-15-24a1.pdf ) ) starting on page 7 :  no blocking . 
  ** consumers who subscribe to a retail broadband internet access service must get what they have paid for -- access to all ( lawful ) destinations on the internet . 
  ** this essential and well-accepted principle has long been a tenet of commission policy , stretching back to its landmark decision in carterfone , which protected a customer 's right to connect a telephone to the monopoly telephone network . 
  considering what happend to the us , you are quite right . 
   well the majority of syrians are fleeing the assad regime , so if you think russia is actually helping resolve the migrant crisis you are mistaken . 
  the majority of syrians are fleeing their country * that has had a civil war for 4 years * . 
  that a foreign nation ( the us ) has openly stated to be funding * rebels * . 
  and the migrant crisis \u00a9 is not russia 's problem . 
  russia 's problem is one of their allies ( what 's left of syria/assad ) is under siege . 
  surely you understand this ? 
    jfk was n't fucking around with the fear thing . 
  it 's the key . 
   did you forget your tinfoil hat ?
