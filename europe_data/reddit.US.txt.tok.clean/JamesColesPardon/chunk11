  did you forget your argument or do you just respond to these things with  lol tinfoil hurr durr and  something something steel beams/dank memes your reply adds nothing . 
   and the vast majority of the world may not respect american cops but they sure do when it comes to the fbi if i told you the majority of * terrorism * cases ( successfull or patsies ) were either being surveilled by or set up by the fbi would you even click the links ? 
  i doubt it . 
  your flair says poland - have you ever been to the states ? 
  i have lived here my entire life . 
   so it 's really funny you accuse them of `` ruling by fear '' which is complete bullshit . 
  well , your argument so far is `` tinfoil hat '' and `` bullshit '' so you 're not helping your case at all . 
  why is it bullshit ? 
   i assume you 'd also say them bringing down silk roads was wrong , a website that sold everything from body parts to crack with ease . 
  why would you assume that ? 
  you do n't know me and you certainly know my feelings on the matter . 
  but go ahead and disagree with a statement * you assume i agree with * . 
  low level discourse right here . 
   the problem is , the fbi catches so many fucking people and the nsa takes credit by default ... making it look like a worthless program is giving results the fbi sets up idiots to do stupid things . 
  they , like the rest of the agencies - rule primarily by fear . 
  once you conquer that , you 're * free * . 
  jfk was n't fucking around with the fear thing . 
  it 's the key . 
  when we stop complaining * here * , it will start to stop . 
  not before . 
  no worries , kind sir . 
  of course this is really it . 
  but you ca n't just * come out and say it * ... 
  [ here ] ( http://www.nber.org/papers/w9873.pdf ) is a pdf of this study from 13 years ago . 
    my argument is it is very convienent . 
  too convienent . 
   so what 's your explanation ? 
  how could i possibly explain how this actually happened ? 
  i 'm jus a random dude in america with insomnia ( that has improved tremendously ) . 
  i do know that [ this ] ( http://www.worldlingo.com/s5jz3iuwwlqkbxgkofgaqcf3t3gzetjrp/translate ) is interesting . 
  as well as [ this ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20150104153809/https:/pp.vk.me/c619118/v619118911/12350/jjtlj0lgifc.jpg ) , the * alleged * ukrainian buk . 
  i am at least * wiling to entertain an alternative view . 
  * i highly recommend it - at least once in awhile . 
  see you around . 
   i 've read the news , there were plenty of screenshots from multiple independent sources who saw the rebels celebrating the downing of a ukrainian military plane . 
  these are * just screenshots of a random youtube video * . 
  it 's * even less credible tham the videos/tweets themselves * . 
   then the civilians from that area started going through the crash site , uploading pics of normal passenger jet wreckage , so the separatists ' tweets were deleted . 
  they 're still on those news sites . 
  you should know , if you 've been following the news at that time . 
  you are missing the point . 
  of course these tweets/videos existed * and were then deleted * . 
  my argument is it is very convienent . 
  too convienent . 
  it 's not that you are not trustworthy . 
  but i do not think your sources are . 
  now , i 'll ask again :  how do you know ? 
    . . and were these tweets from rebels cited in this thread verified ? 
   no , they were deleted soon after the rebels realised that they shot down a passenger jet and not a ukrainian military cargo plane . 
  ... according to who ? 
  think , man . 
   that 's very much not the issue at hand . 
  answering a question about censorship by pointing at * classification * is disingenuous at best . 
   over-classification is a serious problem and one seemingly endemic to large organisations focused on national security . 
  but it 's absolutely nothing to do with the question being asked . 
   ** simply put , what the state feels it must conceal from the public is totally different to what the state attempts to hide or remove from plain view . 
  ** thanks for the quote of the day . 
  whats the difference between the * public * view and * plain * view again ? 
  i have no idea . 
  but they are capable of much more , and can spin things however they want and are fantastic at narrative creation . 
  but i did demonstrate that * entire social media ecosystems can be manipulated and created . 
  i provided a kink from time.com to back up the claim . 
  ... how hard could a couple tweets be ? 
  i could make an airazz account on twitter today and start tweeting things . 
  does n't mean it 's you . 
  . . and were these tweets from rebels cited in this thread ** verified ** ? 
  just keep believing what you are told then . 
  my life rocks dude . 
  i have n't been this happy in awhile . 
  yours ? 
  i did n't say anything like that . 
   if i insisted that the earth is actually flat and kept discussing it with other flat earthers , would you think that i 'm a smart person who has the ability to reason and to think logically ? 
  i 'd think you better have some fantastic evidence for the fantastic claim - but that does n't mean i would downvote them * just because * . 
  we all believe what we believe based on our experiences and our inputs . 
  different people have different inputs and therefore different belief systems . 
  maybe * to them * their views are * reasonable and logical * . 
  i would n't know without engaging and weighing their evidence , respectfully . 
  how else are you supposed to learn and grow ? 
  so who determines what is classified ? 
  those who are * following orders * ? 
  just as i thought . 
  i hope you find peace . 
  i wo n't be going anywhere . 
  and i 've been here for months . 
  ad hominems do n't help your argument in the slightest . 
  i guess you have to ask yourself - why is an alleged * 9/11 truther nutcase * more stringent with the facts and less vulnerable to propaganda than yourself . 
  i have a +20 comment in this very thread linking to quote from op . 
  have you even read it yet ? 
  i do n't think you 've acknowldged a single thing i ' ve linked to or mentioned thus far ( besides downvote of course ) . 
  i have even remained positive and respectful inspite of constant insults from you . 
  why does your worldview need to be so right ? 
  why are you so sure ? 
  do you question anything ? 
  either way - i am so sorry for you . 
  what conspiracies have i spouted in this thread besides pointing out that social media bullshit can be and is manipulatable , and it 's disengenuous to speak of it in a literal evidence thread ? 
  why not point out what the dutch report says about this ? 
  what does it say about the * youtube videos * ? 
  i was going to say that whole 28 pages thing ... 
  but it 's not censorship if it 's * internal documents * , right ? 
  so what do you define as censorship ?
