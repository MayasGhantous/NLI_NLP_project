  why not steal his wallet and watch and shit to at least make it * look like a mugging * ? 
  seems like it would be easy . 
  they did n't because whoever ** murdered ** seth wanted everyone to know it * was n't a mugging * . 
   i would not be surprised if he fumbled searching for stuff to steal but in panic could not find anything and fled . 
  i would be . 
  this is america . 
  we know how to do gun violence . 
  it 's * common sense * here . 
   also , this reminds me of a conversation i had with some guy that was telling me how disappearance of the malaysian airlines plane was orchestrated . 
  first of all who would that benefit ( beans were already spilled , and dnc is not kgb ) , and secondly why not consider the occam 's razor ? 
  are you seriously just throwing as much shit out there to see what fits ? 
  you watch too much cnn if you 're still pining for a malaysian airline coverage . 
  federal background checks and waiting periods do exist you know . 
  far cry from the * any joe schmo felon can get a gone and get ` er done * as you implied . 
  and no rebutted from the mugging comment ? 
  now that we know half your comment was wrong - let 's address the other part . 
  in georgia - does * mugging * mean something different ? 
   sources allege that the case is being investigated as a suicide , ** as the journalist had reportedly sent an email to a relative saying he had planned to commit suicide . 
  was n't mugged . 
  unless this particular mugger does n't steal anything ( wallet/watch/etc was still on his person ) from their dead victims ? 
  and your joe schmo argument about same day gun purchasing is laughable . 
  10/10 good troll . 
  got me to bite . 
  straight up murdered . 
  media silent . 
   usa has never annexed any country post ww1 . 
  ** the iraq war was a mistake by a president that is long gone ** and not a lifetime dictator like putin . 
  and let 's not forget hussein started this whole thing by invading its neighbours ( iran , kuwait ) and gassing the kurds it was voted for by the us congress , not just a unilateral action by a president . 
  oh - and one of the senators who voted for it is a hawk who actively proceeded with * regime changes * in countries with her position as secretary of state as recently as libya ( and i count ukraine as well in this mess ) . 
  and she has been the media 's favorite since last november to become president . 
  these policies will continue as long as they have to . 
  more accurately the people voted for how their government should act . 
   what is the effective difference between that an secession ? 
  it 's all about consent . 
  maybe my neighbor likes all this eu/america crap . 
  good for them . 
  if it makes them happy more power to 'em ( although i 'll be trying to get them to reconsider in a nonviolent way ) . 
   still being able to call yourself a citizen ? 
  because if they have no power over you that is functionally the same as being independent . 
  why not take it all the way ? 
  secession are usually messy and i see no need for violence . 
  to make it more of an eu scenario - it would be like a citizen of france acknowledging that the eu exists but that that person is n't subject to brussels decrees and regulations . 
  kind of like -  i acknowledge the idea and existence of eu citizenship and those who identify with such , but i 'd rather live my life as a french/dutch/etc citizen instead . 
  i have no idea how this relates to what i was saying . 
  well that sounds silly . 
  then the folks i 'm talking about would still be able to enjoy those services , showing again that / u/bloodysneeze jumps to conclusions too easily . 
  if you people are so neutered that you need to have your communications logged and sniffed for safety - more power to ya . 
  i will tell stories of you to my children . 
  if the district ca n't show that you 're in their jurisdiction it does n't matter either way . 
  if you know what i mean . 
   while it 's important to not fall into the founding fathers deification , some of them tried to crated a better system not only for themselves . 
  how the comprise is came out and how it fits today is another thing . 
  far from it . 
  there were tremendous economic incentives for the founding fathers for a stronger central government . 
  hamilton advocated a return to monarchy !, 
    when do the people 's personal whims convert into the people 's whims ? 
   in a ideal world when they vote and the government implements it as policy . 
  ymmv but generally you get that in places that are democracies and no just have in the name . 
   err yeah - the ` many ' you talk about do n't make up a big voting demographic and the ` snoopers charter ' is a mixed bag - increases investigatory powers but also increases oversight . 
  like the patriot act ? 
  nice . 
   our intelligence spending is unremarkable ( much lower per capita than the us , for example ) but much more efficiently spent . 
  you spy on your citizens far more efficiently than your american counterpart . 
   as the use of the data is still going to be restricted to intelligence and law enforcement then yeah democracy . 
  this has nothing to do with democracy . 
  why conflate the two ? 
   i still ca n't find an objection in what you 've written aside from what amounts to ` the people who were outvoted did n't get what they wanted ' which is pretty core in a democracy . 
  when did i say anything remotely close to this ? 
  i 'm not sure tbh . 
  i just find it fascinating from a legal perspective as some of their arguments are quite sound . 
   the people are the sum of the citizens ( it 's the the one from the preamble to your constitution ) , we the people were a group of lawyers , landowners and slave owners and bankers who wrote the us constitution . 
  i know who the people are . 
   the people are just some guys . 
  i would say that they wish to usurp the power of all of the people to apply to any of their personal whims . 
  when do the people 's * personal * whims convert into the people 's whims ? 
  what is his state again ? 
  why would a state have to secede ? 
  states have citizens too . 
  with constitutions and rights secured . 
  in fact - the federal government in the united states is the guarantor of a republican form of government for the citizens of the ( so-called ) several states . 
  there is actually a growing movement in the states specifically about this . 
  if it actually gets off the ground it would be fun to watch . 
  for these folks ( at least in the us ) - yes . 
  they want to be left alone from the feds . 
  not ** all ** authority . 
  popular misconception . 
  i hear there are many out there who are against the surveillance state and the snoopers charter from where i 'm from . 
  seems were spending an awful lot of money to be spied on . 
  but then again the author of that is now your prime minister so you 're sol anyway . 
  democracy , right ? 
  then you should be very happy !, 
  are your police and fire departments run by your federal or local authorities ? 
    subject to a government  democracy says that the people ( citizens ) are the sovereign of the country and the government express their will . 
  kind of . 
  it merely states that the people are the government . 
  in the united states we do n't have a democracy ( in a sense ) - we have a democratic republic ( by definition ) . 
  these things are different . 
  in reality what the united states currently has is mostly resembling an oligopoly at this point but americans do n't like discussing such unpleasantries . 
   these people just do n't the understand that in that relationship you speak of the people and not just the people . 
  this statement makes no sense .
