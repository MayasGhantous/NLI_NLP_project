  if the people wish to be free of their government , and the people ( in a democracy ) are the government ... should n't the government listen to the people ? 
  exactly . 
  just a couple murders and no big deal . 
  they 're better at making sure reporters do n't get access as well either . 
  edit : it appears you 're down voting here for whatever reason and i have no choice but to respond in kind . 
  even though that 's not an * i disagree * button . 
   yea , thats why the government did nothing with the bundy siege other than wait it out . 
  if that shit happened in the 1990s there would have been more violence . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the fbi shot the latest bundy protest group in the back . 
  are you deliberately or just accidently uninformed ? 
  ... and way to root for more government sanctioned violence ( including the tanks and firebombs used in waco ) . 
  how many children died that day again ? 
  so instead of a police state you have a secret intelligence state not run by the police . 
  way better !, 
  i mean ... would n't you want to be left alone if you could achieve such a thing ? 
  mostly things like the open society foundation which has funded some pretty neat divide and conquer * movements * in the us to keep everyone busy and distracted . 
  not just dwb are ngos . 
  just a surveillance state . 
  ran by police ? 
  you do know that the united states kills * bad guys * all over the world via predator drone from a base in colorado with no oversight and no accountability , without regard to whether or not they are us citizens ( like it should matter anyway ) , and base their targets on meta-analysis and sim cards , right ? 
  oh wait - that 's whatabouttism . 
  disregard . 
  or most of them just want to be left alone . 
  those events you mentioned have plenty of issues with them with or without the sovereign citizen ( and oxymoron anyway - you ca n't be a citizen subject to a government and be sovereign at the same time ) . 
  source : used to roll with this group . 
  must be nice to just wipe away any worldview that differs from yours like a jedi mind trick . 
  you know what they call it when you refuse to accept reality as it is presented to you ? 
  how does one make the pot calling the kettle black from where you are from ? 
  this guy is offering * boots on the ground * anecdotal evidence and you dismiss him . 
  why ? 
  because it conflicts with * your * worldview ? 
  rhymes with newspeak . 
  i can run the numbers . 
  since 1950 ? 
  thanks , wesley . 
   guerillas putin supported shot down plane full of people . 
  it is a highly publicized event . 
  [ citation required ] . 
  the dutch safety board report does * not * say this . 
   when mh370 was lost it was highly publicized as well despite not being connected to russia . 
  then came russia 's obstructionism regarding the investigation which only inflamed things more . 
  it is no wonder why people were upset . 
  define obstructionism . 
   also , the afghanistan hospital was on the cover of major news outlets . 
  there have been many incidents like this . 
  coverage in passing and the pentagon and having no real response or repercussions lead many to believe that it 's just the cost of doing business . 
   yes they did . 
  they have no reason to organise a coup in turkey though because turkey is already in nato . 
  ** no reason for them to work with g\u00fclen either . 
  ** except he 's a billionaire holed up in pennsylvania ? 
  it 's nice to have * back up plans * just in case * regime change * is necessary . 
  and us courts just threw out a case against him weeks ago and we just had testimony in the us house * the day before * regarding turkey 's slide from democracy . 
  other than that . 
  so instead of calling him names and blowing him off - refute his/her points . 
  and who said anything about a conspiracy ? 
  i thought you guys got better educations than we do in the states . 
  it seems like * conspiracy * is a term many use to try and initiate a thought-terminating cliche to equate points ( that you have n't refuted , mind you ) you do n't like with lizard people . 
  so does that mean the degree is a 40 or a 60 ? 
  whatever that means . 
  i have a doctorate in the us . 
  where would i be on the graph ? 
  so how do you interpret the blue dots in the top right corner ? 
  are they 40-60 % educated ( whatever that means ) and have a 75-100 % chance of voting remain ? 
  it 's a poorly set up graph . 
  i get it . 
  the horizontal x axis just says ( more degree educated ) . 
  does that mean % ? 
  so 56 % of the dots have at least a college degree ? 
  does a medical degree carry the same weight as a lib arts degree and an art degree and a finance degree ? 
  does the school itself matter ? 
  and the y axis has no label at all . 
  * what do the numbers mean ? 
  * did the bbc declare to remain or leave ? 
  what does those axes mean ? 
  they 're not labeled and just numbers and red/blue dots more than anything . 
  the lines do n't appear to follow the curve well , either . 
  what does  more capable than the average voter mean ? 
  and [ citation ] please . 
  kthanks . 
  what does education have to do with it then ? 
  is there a data distribution/bell curve correlating education level with the likelihood of being cool with immigrants ? 
  ... that 's not irony . 
  why would n't they just roll up to switzerland ? 
  unfortnately they can reapply ( learn your treaties ) and cant leave for 2 years ( learn your treaties ) . 
    they still are if you follow the medical/recreational cannabis issue ( and gay marriage up until a year ago ... )  it is nowhere near the same . 
  back then states ' rights included the right to reject ** federal taxation and customs ** , the ** right to secede , ** the right to preserve slavery in spite of federal decisions . 
  today states still have rights but they are far more limited . 
  it is a federation today . 
  the commerce clause ? 
  texas v. white ? 
  come on man this is 101 stuff . 
  it 's a federation today because the south got roflstomped ( and goaded into it anyway if you start looking into fort sumpter ) . 
   what is shocking is that most of the southern officers in the federal army , by its very nature the most pro-federal part of the country , sided with their native states when the proverbial hit the fan . 
  are you seriously saying that the south was the most pro-federal part of the country pre-civil war ? 
   you did n't have a true federation until the civil war ( 1860s ) . 
  up until then the country was called the united states of america ( plural ) , it still is referred to as that , although according to subsection [ 15a-c ] ( https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/3002 ) the united states is also a federal corporation . 
   states ' rights were all the rage , they still are if you follow the medical/recreational cannabis issue ( and gay marriage up until a year ago ... )  and most of even us federal army officers from the south felt more loyalty to their home state than to the usa . 
  `` how can i draw my sword upon virginia , my native state , '' the most famous of 60 % of the virginian officers who turned against their army and their nation had said . 
  a confederate soldier and commander of all forces sides with his state in a civil war - shocking .
