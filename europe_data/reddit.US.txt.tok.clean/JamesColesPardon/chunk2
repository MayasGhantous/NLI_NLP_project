  not really . 
  the israeli ( re : not jews , but a nation ) plot is n't even first , but third down the line . 
  and if you 're still working on 9/11 you 're so far in the rearview that it 's tough to make up the time now . 
  but considering you have nothing else to say here , continue flinging shit against the wall about other online communities of 300,000 people . 
  everyone else here will see how your poor argument skills and lack of professionalism have hurt your cause , and will certainly lead to demerits ( or whatever negative enforcement they use ) in the morning . 
   ok , so , you were wrong . 
  saddam became an enemy by invading and annexing allies of the usa . 
  according to who ? 
  the state department initially signed off on saddam 's kuwaiti invasion . 
  have you read the [ glaspie cable ] ( https://wikileaks.org/cable/1990/07/90baghdad4237.html ) ? 
   it had jack shit to do with your petrodollar bullshit . 
  same thing with libya . 
  it was literally spearheaded by the eu . 
  wrong . 
  it was nato , not the eu , enforcing un resolution [ 1973 ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_1973 ) . 
  define spearheaded ? 
  the uk , france and belgium proposed it . 
  is that what you meant ? 
  it must suck when * facts * are on the * conspiracy theorist side * . 
  are we talking about gulf 1 or 2 ? 
  because i can go all night . 
   literally right this second the sub has a sticky blaming the jooz on 9-11 . 
  take it up with the mods then . 
  i am not a representative for the community ( and fail to see the sticky blaming jews anyway ) . 
  why argue with me about it ? 
   that sub is full of disgusting people . 
  i would argue this sub reeks of the same filth , but that gets us nowhere , right ? 
  where does it come from ? 
   our prime minister allegedly owns shares in a company that funds terrorist organisations in the middle east : }  the eu and the us are fully aware of that . 
  well , they do too . 
   haha . 
  that is amazing.i only based out on this one post that you belong there . 
  there 's some pretty neat people there , you should check it out . 
  they 'll believe anything , and if you breadcrumb them facts they will end up where they should . 
   i guess kuwait never happened . 
  sure it did . 
  but they also had the daughter of a kuwaiti ambassador pose as a nurse in hospital to congress , in order to propagandize the american government into into gulf war 1 . 
  [ that was a conspiracy , sure . 
  maybe you should go make a post about it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nayirah_ ( testimony ) to / r/conspiracy . 
   much easier to rant like loons about jews , shadow governments and the petrodollar . 
  way to paint a sub of 300,000 into 3 neat little pictures . 
  it 's refreshing to see that you have nothing left . 
  and i barely post there anymore . 
  how thick are you ? 
   lol the american is the bad one but the guy saying saddam was a good guy and all democracy 's is n't ? 
  i did n't say that saddam was a good guy . 
  but he was * our boy * and as soon as he served his purpose ( was a proxy check on iran ) and wanted to start selling oil in non-dollars he was gone right quick . 
  same with gaddaffi . 
  these are facts , man . 
   other americans want that guy , we do n't want hypocritical people as yourself who shrug off all opposing opinions as propaganda . 
  never have i said the word propaganda in this thread . 
  perhaps you have me confused with someone else ? 
  or did you read too far into the script ? 
  i 'm supposed to bring up propaganda via smith-mundt . 
  it should be on page 4 ( or 5 , i forgot ) . 
  not you . 
  it 's so hard to find good help these days . 
   in your eyes being orwellian is fine , so long is its some dictator doing it and we can quietly condemn them without actually caring right ? 
  never said anything like that . 
   rhe global system is anarchic our laws at home do not apply to the world and to act like they do is silly . 
  never said anything like that . 
   thats a prediction , not a plan . 
  whats the difference when the prediction comes true based on caclulated ontervenyions ? 
   you know many churchill himself predicted that an amphibious landing at gallipoli would end in disaster . 
  and sure enough when he tried it 10 years later thats exactly what happened , but to say he intentionally planned , that it was his intent , for that campaign to end like that would be wrong . 
  sounds like a shitty short term memory situation . 
   the plan going into iraq was not to have it turn out the way it did . 
  how can you say that when the guy who predicted this exact outcome had a had in the policies and companies responsible for the * exact * effect ? 
   well i made `` peace with it too '' for whatever that means . 
  ** i can tell you that no one planned for iraq to turn out the way it did , ** that was due to horrible incompetence , though it makes it no less of an atrocity . 
  i can . 
  the secretary of defense said this would happen in 1994 . 
  he said leaving a power vacuum in baghdad would leave the place a quagmire . 
  he was also the vice president stumping to do this less than a decade later ( and as the former ceo of halliburton , his company became rich with government contracts afterwards ) . 
  because war is a racket . 
  [ here is dick cheney in 1994 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6beszmvrq-i ), 
  other americans do n't want this guy either . 
  or at least i do n't . 
  did you read his fluffing of bombing campaigns with robots ( somewhat extralegal ) and civilian casualties ( unfortunate collateral damage ) ? 
  gow orwellian can you get ? 
  this is what it looks like when you come in contact with an * all in * ministry of truther . 
  doublespeak . 
  and it '' s doubleplusungood . 
  this is a very interesting display of votes . 
  why do you suppose it is so ? 
  i have followed reddiquette and have treated everyone here with respect . 
  why do you keep calling them migrants instead of refugees ? 
  or does the term * migrant * have a different definition/comnotation across the pond ? 
  looks like it 's on you , / u/gnobe . 
  how bad do you want change ? 
  sounds like all this surveilance is useless anyway . 
  are they really keeping natsec by issuin nsls to [ reddit ] ( https://m.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2u3sqp/reddits_first_transparency_report/ ) if they ca n't do shit ? 
  it 's all just doublespeak for some good old fashion brown shirting . 
  and it 's disgusting . 
  scroll up . 
  i only jumped in when fascism was discussed . 
  and * i 'm * talking about nationalism/patriotism vs fascism . 
  i fail to see yours . 
  we 're not talking about greece here . 
  more in generalities because aparently some here think fascism = hitler .
