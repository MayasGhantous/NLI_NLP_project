  it 's only a few words . 
  western troops are n't nato troops ? 
  everything not in a ** new ** member state , for starters . 
  yes . 
  to you . 
  i like how the premise is flawed from jump when it says  in ** new ** member states, 
  operation paperclip . 
  operation paperclip . 
  were doing that , i think . 
  and yet the downvotes go away . 
  funny how that works . 
  13 points a day ago in r/europe ? 
  this place is dead and you know it . 
  not you 're not making any sense . 
  who else is reading this thread ? 
  i do n't see any insults and i choose my words very carefully . 
  perhaps you can educate yourself regarding socrates and his questions and get back to me ? 
  any reason why you 're wasting downvotes in this thread ? 
  how can you have two soverigns ? 
  like i 've said before  i choose my words very carefully . 
  i think it 's an awful shame and crisis and wish it was the top priority to solve ( which includes syria and the middle east in general ) . 
  i 'd gladly help out as best i could . 
  but i do n't see any solutions . 
  this is what i warned against . 
  do not underestimate them . 
  yep . 
  which means if those parties are thinking ahead - they better have some good solutions for the migrant crisis that do n't include trains and camps . 
  what 's the downside in the rise of nationalism/conservatism ? 
  schengen being threatened ? 
  civil liberty erosion ? 
  i 'm not dismissing these claims - just trying to think ahead and entertaining a thought . 
   you choose your words as a trump-acolyte trafficking in meaningless buzzphrases . 
  exactly . 
   fuck `` high energy '' . 
  it means fuck all . 
  it 's the best thing they got goin ' . 
   let me give you a `` heads up '' , too . 
   we 're not going to let it happen here . 
  that 's fine man . 
  i do n't need the ` tude though . 
  i 'm not advocating for anything like that . 
  just giving you a heads up , is all . 
  and i choose my words very carefully . 
   the local alt-right authoritarians are flocking to him , and they will do it for them . 
   no need for them to set up an `` operation '' in an alien country . 
  the `` operation '' is already up and running , in the form of various populist alt-rightists trending in local regions . 
  sure . 
  all i 'm saying is they 're noticing how powerful being * high energy * combined with being * connected * can be ( and they 're not wrong ) . 
   they are going to win everywhere , because they will play on immigration fears ( some of them very justified ) and after they win , they 're going give all of these people the shaft and shift even more wealth from the middle to the upper class . 
  everywhere ? 
  i think they might in france ( although i 'm still going to hedge and would bet against it now but it may change in a month or two ) and it might in the netherlands . 
  if both of those pop - the european experiment is going to be put on hold because we 're all gon na be a bit too high energy to move in any coherent direction globally . 
  which is fine , i think as long as it 's temporary and does n't lead to war . 
  i thought the soverign was soverign ? 
  of all eurolamd countries , greece is the only one i can get my wife to agree to go to . 
  hoping to visit soon . 
  take all my tourist dollars . 
  that is a goal of a particular group of people , yes . 
  i think it 's fun to watch , but thats about it . 
  i would not underestimate them . 
  what a sexist program . 
  but the truth remains . 
  you do n't know the first thing about socrates . 
  do you have anything to offer besides insults ? 
  you can not have different truths . 
  not just that site . 
  because that boy has mammary glands . 
  it 's tough yo tell in [ current year ] . 
  based on the cup size i 'd say it 's more like jenna bush . 
  yikes dude be safe . 
  who said anything about world economies ? 
  again - either you 're moving goalposts or have a reading comprehension/attention issue . 
  i 'm talking about america . 
  and the issues that are bubbling up with munucipalities , their bond ratings , and their ability to stay afloat . 
  i 'm not saying it will ripple out enough to touch the world economy ( although who really saw credit default swaps in america affecting the eurozone ? ) . 
  why would you try and connect the two ( besides being about to dispute * that * and brush off any legitimate concerns i 'm actually talking about ) ? 
  nice goalpost move , comrade . 
  [ what 's this all about ? 
  ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/muni-bond-investors-left-holding-the-bag-for-pension-debacle-2017-01-16 ), 
  holy shit if you 're in ireland we have a serious media problem if these are things you actually believe . 
  cut the hyperbole . 
  that 's not at all how it works here . 
  the great american bond collapse is what it shall be called . 
  it 's good you know now . 
  but do n't repeat it here . 
  it 's against the narrative . 
  ah , yes , insults and mean words . 
  when you have no facts , you try and drag people down to pull yourself up . 
  such a sad existence . 
   lol jesus , was it a cia conspiracy now ? 
  i do n't know . 
  it usually takes about 40 years to find out what the cia is doing in any country regarding restructuring their government . 
  you 've read the history of their involvement in latin america , right ? 
  it 's not like it did n't happen . 
   was poor , innocent russia justified with their invasion ? 
  get that dumb shit out of here . 
  these year-old talking points are not relevant to anything i said nor did i resolve the russian federation of anything ( unless you meant to reply to someone else who actually stated this ) . 
   if euromaiden happened because america * `` sponsored '' * it , than by that same logic the eu striaght-up orfanized & micromanaged it . 
  how so ? 
  this is the part that i 'd love to hear more on .
