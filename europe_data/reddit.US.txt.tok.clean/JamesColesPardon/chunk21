   and nobody was talking about lethal aid . 
  she was n't talking about lethal aid . 
  the us was . 
  we had debates about it in the us congress . 
  [ in 2015 ] ( https://www.rferl.org/a/us-ukraine-russia-lethal-aid-bill/27356526.html ) and two weeks after we inaugurated the [ new president ] ( http://thehill.com/policy/defense/317592-mccain-to-trump-send-weapons-to-ukraine ) . 
   which makes the lack of support & cooperation from the eu to help ukraine that much more infuriating . 
  i agree . 
   and just how in the hell did it * `` strengthen '' * america ? 
  it utterly weakened our hand . 
  a weaker eu inevitably makes a stronger us ( especially when they get the eu to weaken the russian federation for them - this should be obvious , no ? ), 
  in a zero-sum kind of way . 
   the un is fucking useless , but we were forced to try & hit back agaunst russia through them because the eu was being , rather impressively , * even more useless than the un * . 
  what would have been their role ? 
  the main powers at the unsc are always involved in some way and as long as it is structured the way it is it will continue to do what it does . 
   she had a point . 
    the eu helped create the mess by pushing the trade agreement with ukraine in the first place , and when russia invaded they were paralyzed by infighting & did n't want to help america support ukraine . 
  i think the only thing missing right in the middle of this scenario is the state dept. 
  sponsored maidan * situation * which lead to breakaway crimea , but sure . 
  i guess i never faulted the eu for their negotiations creating that divide anyway and probably should think on it some more . 
  how was that agreement viewed in the eu proper ? 
  was it necessary or frivolous ? 
  was anyone worried about what would happen after popping kiev a bit further away from russian orbit ? 
   the state department literally had to turn to the useless as shit un to try & forge some progress in helping ukraine instead of being able to work with a close ally who helped create the mess in the first place . 
  the us congress was n't on board with sending lethal aid either , iirc . 
  if only they could say abracadabra article 5 like other folks ...  so yeah , when it comes to private conversations , fuck the eu in that scenario . 
  this naturally strengthens the us in the process . 
  this is nowhere near a fact in at least one version of america i currently reside in , for what it 's worth . 
  it 's times like these you have to remember then deputy secretary of state for the united states in a leaked phone call regarding the cast and characters of the new government being created in kiev :  fuck the eu i 'm sorry , fwiw . 
  most americans do n't want this but most ca n't even see it ( or fathom it ) and it at times feels like a sinking ship around here . 
  doing a helluva job . 
  was n't the snoopers charter her doing ? 
   yes , that 's what you are doing here . 
  was n't it you who started this `` esl '' and `` native language '' thing ? 
  because you do not understand the definitions to english words and you self identify as estonian so i went with the most likely scenario . 
  how does this not make sense ? 
  maybe it 's the estonian schools ? 
   you can repeat your bullshit how many times you like but you are the only one here who has flawed understanding of  the `` conspiracy theory '' term . 
  what 's the definition ? 
   please go study english and some reality more before trying to correct others - you are just putting random words to your sentences and think you have an `` argument '' . 
  the ironic part is you have even less of one than i do . 
  i just get triggered when people do n't know what the term * conspiracy theory * is . 
  you got a whole list of other issues you need to sort out it seems . 
   in case you did not notice you are on / r/europe so you can shove your `` esl '' and other `` native language '' things to your ass , right where all other your conspiracy theories are located . 
  such a surprise for you that there are 24 official languages in eu and even more unofficial . 
  not a surprise at all . 
  i 've been on this board for over a year . 
  but it * we * are discussing your lack of knowledge in english , so that 's the only thing i can go with . 
   ** edit : ** how come that you , a native speaker , are making a grammar/syntax mistakes , like : probably because it 's sunday morning in the states and i 'm just starting my second cup of coffee . 
  it 's also funny to watch someone pick on spelling and grammar when they are backed into a corner after getting called out on not knowing things . 
  it actually hurts what little argument you still have . 
    different in your native language ** than ** that explains everything want to try and get a definition yet ? 
  i can link the official english definition and you can translate it to your native tongue using any number of websites and software . 
   i see you are a mod of / r/conspiracy . 
  i guess you have great proficiency in facts like 9/11 orchestrated by cia , illuminati , moon landing that never happened , etc. 
  i 've spent more time looking at that stuff than you have , sure . 
    you 're one of those . 
   so , yes - i am one of illuminati and a cia & mi5 employee combined . 
  i meant you 're * one of those who does n't know what a conspiracy or a theory is * . 
  `` go google it , '' * they say * , because they ca n't answer for themselves . 
   do you know what was his original comment ( that is deleted now ) ? 
  i will recite it ( roughly ) for you , again : great . 
  esl . 
    `` with huge money wasting on pro-nato propaganda there is no surprise . 
  i bet this article is paid for by nato . 
  i see the opposite in germany - everyone i talk with hates nato ''   1 . 
  * `` with huge money wasting on pro-nato propaganda there is no surprise '' * - implies there is paid nato propaganda = = conspiracy theory do you honestly think that nato spends zero time , money and energy towards improving their public relations with the planet ? 
  they 'd be dumb not to . 
  there 's both pro- and anti-nato propaganda that exists . 
  again , not a conspiracy theory ( proving that you do not know of which you speak ) . 
  * `` i bet this article is paid for by nato '' * - see # 1 again , not a conspiracy theory . 
  * `` i see the opposite in germany - everyone i talk with hates nato '' * - implies that is nato being hated by the population = = false ( or a conspiracy theory in combination with # 1 & # 2 items ) again , not a conspiracy theory . 
  that 's that users personal opinion after anecdotal evidence . 
  is xe telling the truth ? 
  we 'll never know . 
  but none of the garbage you teased out of a 3 sentence comment has anything to do with conspiracy theory . 
  considering you dodged the question earlier - i 'm a dumb american so english is all i have . 
  if this is a translation thing and ` conspiracy theory ' means something different in your native language than that explains everything . 
  but in english it does n't mean what you think it does - and i suggest you familiarize yourself with their definitions . 
  who knows what other english terms you have inappropriately have assigned meaning to . 
   lookup `` conspiracy theory '' word definition . 
  oh , you 're one of * those * . 
   or do you also think that nato is extremely unpopular and this research is false and paid by nato money ? 
  because that 's what he claimed . 
  that 's not what he claimed . 
  is english not your first language ? 
  if so , i totally understand . 
  how is that a conspiracy theory . 
  what is the ultra left conspiracy theory ? 
  i see nothing in that comment . 
  yep . 
  the messy realities of * regime change * ... 
  those weapons went to isis in syria via the cia . 
  a drop was botched and the us embassy in bengazi took fire and an ambassador was killed . 
  cover was given by the usg as youtube video outrage and the weapons went to ` moderate ' rebels to take over damascus . 
  he 's also pretty much guaranteed cohabitation . 
  it 's gon na be great !, 
  alaska can come too . 
  nah dude everyone knows it 's israeli . 
  did they go on television to advocate resistance ? 
  because that 's what i was talking about .
