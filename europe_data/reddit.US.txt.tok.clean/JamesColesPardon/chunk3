  they were for germany at the time . 
  that 's ** not fascism ** . 
  that 's nationalism . 
  or being patriotic . 
  there is a difference . 
  what is your definition of fascism ? 
   is it really surprising anymore ? 
   we should start kidnapping random russian politicans or their super rich children who live overseas under pretext of them being a spy , just like they did with estonian guy . 
  yeah !, 
  and maybe then we can call them * enemy combatant * , put them in a military prison in a country we just started having diplomatic relations wit again after a generation , and #torture them maybe that will show the russian government we mean business . 
  it worked in the middle east - * terrorism * is at an all time low !, 
  i ca n't stop reading it . 
  over and over and over and over . 
  i fail to see why russia has anything to do with a proper investigation . 
  just investigate it . 
  the preliminary report ( which i 'm sure all here have read , right ? ), 
  said nothing of buks or * russian-backed rebels * or the social media/youtube videos the us state dept was prancing around with afterwards , and only mentioned ` high energy projectiles . ', 
  just release the report - make it transparent and accessible - and the truth will conquer . 
  or in latin , because i 'm feeling especially fancy this morning :  vincit veritas, 
  it 's worth noting that this whole period coincides with the clandestine operation gladio program , which was run through nato , as a * strategy of tension * under the guise of an underground force to combat a possible soviet invasion , but instead was utilized to isolate radicals and increase the state 's power . 
  my apologies , kind ser . 
  you chaps also are set up to have some solid gains . 
  are those made in house ? 
  boeing just had a big one with the house of saud so maybe their attention is over there currently . 
  if anything , i 'm sure nato forces will need to be updated over the next year or two and many of the bases will get refurbished . 
  a slow build-up , if you will . 
  what would trouble me is if this increase in spending has to come at a cost to social safety nets and other programs that help a population from the inside out - including affordable medical services , a focus on preventative health , national sustainability and independence , infrastructure improvements , etc , due to many being tied to the euro and ultimately not in control of their budgets . 
  american military industry must be feeling pretty good right now . 
  unless you were the us , of course . 
  we had to deal with this in america in the mid 1800s . 
  and we had just got rid of our central bank . 
  i wish you all the very best . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  or the flairing feature allows one to conceal their true origins . 
  i 'm still american though , fwiw . 
   `` the nation '' does not become more profitable . 
  ** the goods which were formerly produced in america are available for less to everybody . 
  ** this does not always happen . 
  at all . 
   i 've let myself be drawn into a discussion about this . 
  like i said , go take an online introductory class into economics . 
  i 'm done with this . 
  pathetic . 
  head on back into your bubble . 
  i 'm sure it 'll protect you when you 're outsourced . 
  at least bread and beer will be cheaper , right ? 
  it 's not a reflection economy theory - but a flaw in * your understanding * about how the world works . 
  sure , people will lose jobs , but * the nation * becomes more profitable . 
  the flaw in your logic is that profits do not necessarily help those who * just lost their jobs * . 
  fuck - the nation got more profitable because it could outsource * something somewhere else * because it was more profitable . 
  their joblessless is the cost of the profitabiliy . 
  now , in places with big social nets and take care of their citizens , you have a point . 
  but in america ? 
  we privatize everything . 
  everything is for profit . 
  even healthcare !, 
  this idea is ridiculous in many other places . 
  so yeah - bring on another one . 
  because frankly they deserve it for being so ill-informed . 
  it 's sad to see people not understanding what 's going on here . 
  you 're not alone . 
  i would tell all my friends for sure . 
  and the mod team here seems top notch after all grisis gweek . 
  when you give a lender institution the power to save economies and give them an out for having to participate , do n't complain when they try and manipulate the situation . 
  i complely agree - in the blame game there are rarely winners . 
  however - it is important to make note of , recognize , and learn from mistakes . 
  well , how silly of them . 
   the imf has its hands tied . 
  they are not allowed to lend in unsustainable situations , and who wrote that rule ? 
  it scales well too . 
  as long as you stay close together the entire raid gets the buff . 
  it will probably be nerfed with the next patch . 
  much obliged . 
  thats an * ad hominem * , ser , and a poor one at that . 
  at least they 're not even trying to be under the table now . 
  are we really making the jump from what happened in ukraine ( no actual investigation wit conclusive proof this way or the other - with the western and russian propaganda obviously pointing fingers ) to 9/11 just like that ? 
  i mean , their report came out a bit later too ( 3-4 years iirc ) . 
  i understand what it 's like to be new to a community , but i have certainly gotten warmer welcomes elsewhere . 
  which is interesting considering how great a job the mods do here during the grisis \u00a9, 
  we just downvote people for asking questions/having alternative opinions/views ? 
  i certainly have n't been disrespectful in any way . 
  well , consider who 's cited in the report ... [ rupert smid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supreme_headquarters_allied_powers_europe#deputy_supreme_allied_commander_europe_.28deputy_saceur.29 ) , a supreme allied commander ) and a dutch pilot trained by the us air force . 
  and the report even confirms that the ukrainian army had buks , and were technically difficult to use ( you could n't just find 'em and use 'em isil-isis-daesh style regarding toyota hiluxes ) . 
  the bigger conspiracy theory to me at this point is it was russian-backed rebels who took control of these things . 
  ukraine even did it to russia in crimea years ago !, 
   and the ** conclusion ** from the crash investigators that the plane was brought down by a missle . 
  [ but they did n't make that conclusion ... ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2015/07/16/mh17-investigation-one-year-on-conclusions-pending/ )  mh17 crashed where eastern ukraine separatists backed by moscow contended with kyiv government troops for territorial control . 
  this was near the ukrainian-russian border , in the donbass region . 
  almost two thirds of the 298 dead were dutch . 
   twelve months later , the netherlands ' investigation is still under way . 
  an internal report was tabled last september . 
  dutch legal authorities have revealed certain findings implicating pro-russian separatists in the disaster but definitive conclusions are not expected until the end of this year . 
  interesting , eh ? 
  proof besides the youtube videos the us state department claimed during their media campaign would be a good start . 
  was there ever conclusive evidence of this ? 
  you are a champion . 
  [ relevant ? 
  ] ( http://www.wikileaks-forum.com/anything-and-everything/8/greece-plan-pythia-1and8243-for-assassinating-pm-karamanlis/8990/ ), 
   it is not . 
  there are no referendums scheduled .
