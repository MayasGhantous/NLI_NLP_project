  if there were , the politicians would have even less room to maneuver . 
  sounds like we 're in agreement here . 
  there we go . 
  i think that is very fair . 
  is it currently set up that way ? 
  seems pretty time consuming . 
  fair enough . 
  i initially i was looking at eu and not ez . 
   yeah . 
  the writer is making the comment that since the greek people spoke in some referendum we should all abide that . 
  ** the rest of europe ( i mean the voters , not the politicians ) had no say in that referendum ** , and probably most would welcome a referendum on the matter in their own countries . 
  are you talking about the most recent greece * oxi * vote ? 
  why would other countries get any input on what the greek people want ? 
  i 'm with you after an agreement is made between greece and the troika - but not before the greeks decide on a package of funds/political reforms . 
  thanks . 
  he 's off by 10 % for greece and almost 50 % for the eu ... edit : #s make sense with ez not eu . 
   the greek people have spoken , sure . 
  the message was muddled and confused , and ** 10 million do not speak for the 300 million ** . 
  are you referring to greece ( 10 million ) vs. 
  the eu ? 
   the estimate was 1.2-1 .5 billion eur per week . 
  damage from the capital controls to the economy . 
  that makes more sense . 
  ... do you have a source for this ? 
   that party has cost at least 2 billion euros to greece 's economy . 
  do you have a source for this ? 
  are you referring to syriza or a party in the traditional sense ? 
  no doubt . 
  fuckin ' sick link ( especially now if you watch it all again ) . 
  i guess the issue i had was that doubted that `` varoufakis '' was listed on the ballot box in january , but if the people had an understanding that a vote for tsipras/syriza would include yanis comong aboard than that makes sense . 
  in america , we obviously do n't vote for these positions and they are just appointments via the executive . 
  well , [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/27/greek-pm-alexis-tsipras-economist-yanis-varoufakis ) says he was * appointed * , not elected after syriza was elected . 
  so which is it ? 
  well , varoufakis was n't elected - was he ? 
  sure , the government itself is representative of the people ( most of the time ) , but the ither beurocrats so not necessarily have the people in their best interests ( because they 're not representatives ) . 
  get it ? 
  war is peace . 
  freedom is slavery . 
  ignorance is strength . 
  so sometimes it 's a group of former ( unelected ) bankers hanging out deciding their country 's ( and eus ) monetary policy ? 
  that 's all i 'm getting at . 
  are the finance ministers elected ? 
  but ukraine is n't in nato ? 
  the ** lack ** of domestic/international espionage policies will obviously cut into so-called * cybersecurity firms * markets , and ** governments will have to pay to not have these practices legalized within their borders ... ** * shudder *, 
  or they are willing to appear to shake people down ? 
  you 're top notch . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9hol8tubum ) is interesting . 
  wan na talk about it ? 
  thanks mate . 
  fuckin ' proud of you . 
  it would be antisemitism not racism . 
  i think it 's cute that there 's a special word for special racism . 
  who cares what it 's called ? 
  same thing . 
  and you brought it up , not me . 
  i am not antisemitic . 
  literally all my friends are jews , and i mean literally in the proper form . 
  try living in the mainline right next to philadelphia . 
  there are jews as far as the eye can see . 
  that post was more for keks than actual serious discussion , though i do hate liberals . 
  ** your ** a retard if you think one race is genetically better then any other . 
  you 're  4 . 
  your joke was funny as fuck why are you backing off of it ? 
  jews give 0 fucks about any jokes about them . 
  most will probably laugh at them with you . 
  i 'm not backing off of anything . 
  juat disputing a racially charged accusation . 
  nothing more . 
  nothing less . 
  your hypothesis is proposterous !, 
  you are the one bringing racism into this , ser . 
  not i. 
  especially with [ this language ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/3ajvoh/things_we_can_learn_from_fall_of_roman_empire/csdl3xs ) it appears someone other than me is obsessed with race ... 
  not really . 
  lem me pick up this can first . 
  nothin ', 
  it 's almost as if there 's a world order afoot . 
  it can be . 
  as long as it 's consensual . 
  or it 's at a cia black site . 
  enhanced interrogation ... 
  i do recall the russian federation giving a boot to foreign ngos already . 
  [ like a year ago ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/24/europe/russia-bans-undesirable-ngos/index.html ) . 
  that 's ok . 
  the us is ok with torture . 
   nope i did n't know that , ** but nothing stopping you replying . 
  ** but , there is something stoping someone from replying . 
   you 're doing that too much . 
  try again in 8 minutes . 
   personally i think it is a bit silly but rules are rules i guess . 
  you could have the mods adjust the restriction ( or remove it ) . 
  rules are only rules until you change them . 
  just like asylum rules and treaties . 
  just change 'em and you 're good to go . 
  people who are constantly downvoted in subs must wait 5-10 minutes per reply . 
  or did you not know that ? 
  what was the threat again ? 
  it seems that lavrov just stated what would be a normal russian federation response to another border country contemplating ( or formally allying with ) nato membership . 
  good punt . 
   you are describing the political situation .
