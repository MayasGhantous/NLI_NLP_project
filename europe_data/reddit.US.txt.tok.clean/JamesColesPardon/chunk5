  i had in mind the military situation . 
   after annexing crimea , russia has invested a lot in their naval and air bases there , and even equipped their forces there with medium ranged iskander missiles , which are capable of being fitted with nuclear warheads ( not saying they have ) . 
  and ? 
  it 's their territory and their naval base . 
   this changes drastically the balance of forces in the black sea , where there are already 2 semi-open conflicts ( russia/ukraine and russia/georgia ) , one strategic conflict ( russia/turkey ) and it is in close proximity to the syrian war . 
  these sound like russian conflicts where they are bolstering their own positions ( although i was unaware that there was an official russia-ukraine conflict - somebody should tell the international community ) . 
   the iskander missiles deployed in crimea can hit the entire romanian seaside , including the largest and most important black sea nato port - constanta . 
  the iskander missiles in crimea are also nsense to dlnerable to the anti-misslie shield installed in romania . 
  why in the world would the russian federation fire nukes towards romania ? 
  it makes absolutely no sense to do this politically or militarily due to the agreed-upon consequences . 
   they mean annexing crimea . 
  which was a response ( a poor one ) to the ousting of the then-president of ukraine which was aided by at least the us state department . 
  and it happened after the people of crimea voted overwhelmingly to approveof the measure . 
  and it happened * 2 years ago * . 
  makes sense . 
  2013 was right before the coup . 
  but this would have hurt goldman . 
  this is not ok . 
  when did / u/greyfells say that he/she was being called a racist ? 
   well , anyone can read about that . 
  he was a socialist and supported the usual socialist reforms aimed at improving people 's lives , the big one being nationalization of the oil resources , then owned by a british company now called bp . 
  he was backed by the communist party . 
  [ citation required ] . 
  these are cia talking points . 
  you 're 60 years late on this propaganda . 
   the communists were backed by the soviet union , which , in 1951 , was a mass-murdering totalitarian regime that looked to us like pure evil . 
  stay on topic , please . 
   this is the problem with superpowers , as i said above . 
  neutrality is n't allowed . 
  every side in every conflict has one side associated with us , and the other side is associated with our enemies . 
  this is what other people fail to understand . 
  we have no choice . 
  please stop referring to ` us ' and ` we , ' as i am fairly certain we would disagree on almost everything at this point and we would certainly not be on the same team . 
  and every conflict does n't have to be about communism or capitalism . 
  it could just be the people of iran who wanted to kick aioc out and used iran 's oil reserves to improve iranian lives instead of enriching british interests . 
   being a superpower means being given a gun and told to shoot the kid who 'll grow up to be the next hitler . 
  absolutely not . 
   look at north korea as an example of what happens when we do n't pull the trigger . 
  during this whole timeline we 're talkin about the un was fighting a war with the dprk puling multiple triggers daily . 
  but i bet this irony fails to register with you as well . 
   we have to make terrible decisions all the time that leave lasting damage on everyone including us , and often any outcome will be a tragedy . 
  no , we dont . 
  we ** do n't ** have to use our intelligence services to interfere with other governments . 
  the tragedy is you think that these decisions ** must ** happen . 
  the white revolution you linked occured ** 10 years ** after the cia/mi6 backed coup . 
  how about you link to what he did days after being apppointed by the shah ( in 1951 ? ), 
  - including nationalizing the aioc and other reforms . 
  surely the class will be interested in both sides here . 
  does your version of this story have an explanation for all of the plans mi6 and the cia had for removing mossedegh years before his eventual fall ? 
  [ really ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol48no2/article10.html ) ? 
   in all the shah 's men , stephen kinzer of the new york times suggests that the explanation may lie ** next door in iran , where the cia carried out its first successful regime-change operation over half a century ago . 
  the target was not an oppressive soviet puppet but a democratically elected government whose populist ideology and nationalist fervor threatened western economic and geopolitical interests . 
  the cia 's covert intervention -- codenamed tpajax -- preserved the shah 's power and protected western control of a hugely lucrative oil infrastructure . 
  ** it also transformed a turbulent constitutional monarchy into an absolutist kingship and induced a succession of unintended consequences at least as far ahead as the islamic revolution of 1979 --, 
  you 'd have to ask the dutch government . 
  they do n't have to abide by this referendum . 
  regardless of the 30 % threshold . 
  for which government ? 
  serraj gets very interesting coverage in the guardian , among other things . 
  i 'm no sure . 
  ** let 's ask them ? 
  do the libyian people get a say in this ? 
  meaning - if it 's mandated by law - you are breaking the law by not wearing it . 
  reading comprehension , right ? 
  obey the laws of host countries . 
  nobody 's forcing them to work at air france ( or as flight attendants for that matter ) - so who cares ? 
  the flair 's not a problem !, 
  i can unflair whenever i want !, 
  watch it . 
  they just fixed the glitch . 
  in america we call that `` baby boomers . '', 
  so - things get obliterated in a warzone ? 
  who woulda thought ? 
  was it operational after the fight to retake it ? 
   monday 's clashes started after separatist militants stormed the sergei prokofiev donetsk airport in the early hours of the morning . 
   ** ukrainian military responded quickly with air strikes ** and an assault by heavily armed troops . 
  from [ ukraine crisis : stand-off amid fight for donetsk airport ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27578440 ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30876223 ) is what the bbc reported the airport looking like a year ago ( after the fighting alluded to above by ukrainian government forces to * take back * their airport from rebels ) . 
  so did the rebels shell the place on their way out ? 
  well , yes . 
  you should certainly do something * about that * . 
  that is not a step in the right direction . 
  one could say the same about america and them only giving two political parties 99.99 % of the coverage , especially when they all agree on the same issues ( some form of corporatism , unimaginable defense spending and domestic surveillance while funding overt and covert operations around the globe in the name of * national security * ) . 
  but yeah - when you control the media you can really do a number on a populace . 
  i 'll give you that . 
  well , that entirely depends on your perspective . 
  long live democracy ? 
  interesting piece . 
  you guys are one pipe bomb away from terror paint-by-numbers like we had in the states under bush ii . 
  dwight would be horrified . 
  exactly . 
  what source are you talking about ? 
  what source ? 
  speak english man . 
  what are you getting me to agree to ? 
  i can write you out a long drawn out reply if you like but i have other plates to spin and this one is becoming less worthy of my attention as time passes . 
  dude wants 4x the budget for toys he can get from northrup grumman , boeing , raytheon and others . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  how can one dispute a material fact ( he said something ... 
  and why do you think i 'm angry ?
