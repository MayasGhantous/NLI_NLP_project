  you 're the one who seems threatened and lashing out - as well as moving goalposts . 
  i ai n't mad . 
  of course he said it . 
  he needs to drum up a fury over a boogeyman so he has something to do . 
  does n't mean he 's right , though . 
  what ? 
  if you do n't think a media outlet funded by the us is n't possibly a bit biased - than i ca n't help you . 
  i am merely stating where their funding comes from . 
  we can call this us-state media - right ? 
  ah yes , radio free europe . 
  funded by the us congress . 
  no bias there . 
  shocked , shocked i tell you . 
   concrete and steel debris from one of the towers fell 500 feet damaging the third building followed by many hours of unchecked fire maybe ? 
  not really . 
  the fire was n't [ even that bad ] ( http://www.debunking911.com/wtc7_nypd2001.jpg ) and if uncontrolled office fires can cause a building to collapse , especially a building that was supposed to be the fema headquarters and had numerous governmenr tenants - we should be revising nyc building code . 
   why would they stage the demolition of a much smaller building ? 
  i 'm not sure . 
  what does the 9/11 commission report say about wtc7 ? 
   two 1000 foot towers is n't enough ? 
  they needed to add another small building for full effect ? 
  why not add a fourth ? 
  i 'm not sure what you mean here . 
    and why were all three collapses at nearly freefall speed ? 
   are you an architect , explosives , thermal dynamics , aviation and structural engineer ? 
  no , but i have two eyes and can count how long it took for those buildings to come down - and they came down at * near free fall resistance no resistance whatsoever from the other 70 + floors ( wtc1 and wtc2 ) or the entire structure ( wtc7 ) . 
  you do n't need an engineering degree - just a stopwatch . 
   i 'm not . 
  do you know anything about structural damage caused by large fully fueled 450 mph jets crashing into a building 80 stories up ? 
  depends . 
  considering 767s ca n't fly at sea level that fast anyway ( and they were allegedly going faster than that , btw ) due to thicker air at that altitude . 
   ( no one knew what would happen ) do you understand the structural dynamics that would be caused by such an event ? 
  what dynamics ? 
  there were big holes and fires in the buildings , and an hour later they exploded into dust and collapsed at near free fall speed . 
  that seemed dynamic enough and an hour after impact . 
  and why were they lobbies destroyed and complely blown out of both wtc1 and wtc2 ? 
  that was weird too . 
   if so , i 'm all ears . 
  otherwise i 'll take the word of the majority of structural engineers and architects who say that it is completely feasible , and was in fact the cause of the collapses . 
  there 's plenty who think otherwise as well . 
  majority opinion = / = fact . 
  there 's plenty of information out there for you to make up your own mind should you choose to look at it closer . 
  but that 's ultimately up to you . 
  i hope you were as entertained as i was . 
  and i argue that your statistic should be 100 % . 
  where 's the disagreement ? 
  how did 2 planes bring 3 skyscrapers down ? 
  and why were ** all three collapses ** at nearly freefall speed ? 
  what a strange response . 
  so the us ** did ** go to afhganistan because of 9/11 ? 
  * ( like i said above ) *, 
  what was tinfoily ? 
  which statements were outlandish ? 
  why did the us care about alqaeda and the taliban again ? 
  where did i support iraq ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  so the us did n't invade iraq and afghanistan for wmd and 9/11 , respectfully ? 
   no it doesnt and you cant . 
  you just spoke for yourself and applied it to everyone else . 
  i mean you can do this but it doesnt make it valid . 
  the majority of americans i know and love think that both invasions were necessary to preserve american safety and freedom . 
  this ai n't science \u00a9 . 
  this is psedo-anonymous internet banter . 
  all of this is opinionated anecdotes . 
   i can say , * everyone hates to eat . 
  * source : me  it doesnt apply to anyone obviously . 
  just relaying what i have seen and noticed over the last decade-and-a-half here . 
  valid enough for me , however misguided they are . 
  welcome to the internet , bro . 
  it should be 100 % , imo . 
  we went to iraq to purge saddam of wmd and because of terrorism ( or something ) . 
  and we went into afghanistan because 19 arabs ( mostly saudis ) led by a saudi billionaire with ties to the cia allegedly brought down 3 skyscrapers in nyc at nearly free-fall speed with what americans believe was 2 boeing 767s . 
  and then we found him in pakistan more than a decade later . 
   you being american doesnt make you a source and you cant speak for anyone but yourself . 
  yes it does and sure i can . 
  this is the internet . 
  but when / u/wongie says he meets people in the west ( a nebulous term in it of itself ) it 's cool , but when an american talks about what americans think ( because i live here ... ) it 's invalid ? 
  got it . 
  the majority of americans think this . 
  source : am american . 
  well , we had [ john mccain ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/15/john-mccain-ukraine-protests-support-just-cause ) and [ victoria nuland ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-victoria-nuland-wades-into-ukraine-turmoil-over-yanukovich/ ) in maidan before things really got heated . 
  the former stating :  '' ** we are here to support your just cause , the sovereign right of ukraine to determine its own destiny freely and independently . 
  and the destiny you seek lies in europe , '' said mccain ** , a leading republican voice on us foreign policy . 
  and the latter [ stating ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957 ) after the overthrow of the government  ** i think yats is the guy who 's got the economic experience , the governing experience . 
  he 's the ... what he needs is klitsch and tyahnybok on the outside . 
  ** he needs to be talking to them four times a week , you know . 
  i just think klitsch going in ... he 's going to be at that level working for yatseniuk , it 's just not going to work . 
  and then  so that would be great , i think , to help glue this thing and to have the un help glue it ** and , you know , fuck the eu ** . 
  so - current top dog neocon senator in another country supporting * protesters * and then the appropriate representative from the executive ( who 's married to a prominent neocon , ironically ) showing up and being recorded talking about the future government and how they 'll sell it . 
  that , like , happened . 
  do n't you think that 's at least * interesting * ? 
  i 'm pretty sure the war is because of a us state dept-backed protest movement in the maidan a little over 2 years ago - which was not received well in the eastern portions of the country . 
  * that 's * what started it - not putin 's approval ratings . 
  to claim otherwise is nothing more than a * conspiracy theory * . 
  unless you need to build pyblic support for an unpopular udea . 
  see us v afhganistan , early 2000s . 
   there is a well known [ isis village ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fgwps89.jpg ) o\u0161ve in bosnia and herzegovina which is recruiting people to fight in syria . 
   everyone knows about it and nobody does anything about it . 
  it 's funded by sunni isis supporters living abroad . 
  ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/islamic-state-flags-appear-then-disappear-bosnian-village-151825230.html )  on thursday , bosnia 's state prosecution said it had ordered security forces to search the village .
