  they came away empty-handed . 
   `` during the activities undertaken , isis flags were not found displayed , '' the state investigation and protection agency ( sipa ) said in a statement . 
  it gave no further details . 
   bosnian state radio cited villagers saying the flags had been erected by neighbors who had since left the community . 
   `` i do n't understand why such a fuss was made in the past 24 hours because of a simple piece of cloth , '' a man , who gave his name as edis and who wore a long beard and short trousers typical for wahhabi followers , told reuters . 
  that was from almost a year ago . 
  there 's absolutely nothing in this comment above that resembles * reason * . 
  at all . 
  you rock , man . 
  per study date : ** may 8 , 2014 **, 
  filthy canadians . 
  someone should tell dictionary.com then . 
  and i would agree with the toddler thing . 
  i have one and they do n't do shit around the house . 
  i 'm just talking about the actual definition ( just looking at the word ) . 
   without a job ; out of work : [ know what i mean ? 
  ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/unemployed ), 
  in america you can . 
  exactly . 
  just change the deginiyion of unemployed . 
  problem solved . 
  well , the difference is you were trying to bring things into a police state without proper papers . 
  hence the threat of violence . 
  probably because they said this back during the bailout negotiations and during the summer ? 
  i had to check the date to make sure this was current after reading the headline . 
  [ here they are saying this in july ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/business/international/international-monetary-fund-proposed-greek-debt-relief.html?referer=&amp;_r=0 ) . 
  in some of the states referendums are binding ( and are usually along the lines of tax issues ) . 
    how can you dismiss a 53 % vote of disapproval ? 
  what level is necessary for a referendum to pass ? 
   the dutch parliamentary system does not allow for binding referendums . 
  and you wonder now why most do n't vote ? 
   even if 100 % would vote , and 100 % would vote against , the decision is for parliament to make . 
    how is the will of a minority ( 47 % ) more powerful than a majority ( 53 % ) ? 
   neither are more powerful than each other , however the parliament is more powerful than a referendum . 
  and you wonder now why most do n't vote ? 
  i know i would n't waste any time in my day . 
   because it 's 53 % of 35 % which is 19 % of the population against the agreement . 
  the other 81 % is either in favour , does not care or does not mind . 
  no , that 's not how voting actually works . 
  53 % who voted said ** no ** . 
  47 % who voted said ** yes ** . 
  why does the lower percentage win ? 
  there 's nothing that you can cite or use to read the minds of those who did n't respond . 
  because they did n't vote . 
  does n't mean they are for or against . 
  they just had something better to do . 
  how can you dismiss a 53 % vote of disapproval ? 
  what level is necessary for a referendum to pass ? 
  how is the will of a minority ( 47 % ) more powerful than a majority ( 53 % ) ? 
  only those who were fooled by the hope & change of the new regime would think this . 
  i 'm fairly certain the us has bombed more countries in this installment of their executive than gwbs . 
  oh - and he got a nobel peace prize , too . 
  was it the brain washing ? 
  i 've got a doctorate in pharmacy from america . 
  will that help ? 
   we do not agree as it does not logical follow . 
  also the real life examples does not indicate that practise countries that conscription are subject to some form of subversion of democracy . 
  did n't say that , but nice try . 
     i 'm still waiting to see how this would change with conscription . 
  surely the political elite will find a way to avoid such a scenario ( as well as their children ) just as they always do . 
  how would this be enforced ? 
  is it by income ? 
  by what standards do you begin to ensure this policy is enacted equally among all its citizenry ? 
   in a country without significant problems with corruption laws like that are easily upheld . 
  can you point me in the direction of one ? 
  because i 'm at a loss at the moment . 
    and what about the real and present danger to liberties of citizens who do not desire such a policy ? 
  are we not in a democracy ? 
  such a large change in policy should certainly include their input on the matter ( which appears to be the case , as more than a quarter of swedes desire no such policy ) . 
   you can be a conscientious objector . 
  under conscription laws - sure . 
  ** in jail ** . 
  a workcamp , essentially . 
   no it is where i tell you that in a society with a strong democratic tradition , low corruption , and a sense of common obligation conscription is a strengthening of those factors not a weakening . 
  it is a sign of real legitimacy of government , when all its power holders come from as wide a range of back grounds as possible , and that include those that bear arms . 
  again , point me in the direction . 
  i 'll buy a ticket tomorrow . 
  i have many federal reserve notes . 
   finally , listening to you makes me think that you might as well argue for a mercenary army . 
  we have those , you know . 
  what makes you think they went out of style ? 
  i 'm arguing against conscription , as it will inevitably be used as a tool of the political elite class to impose policies that may or may not be in the best interests of the majority of citizens ( including an obviously larger burden for those lower on the social ladder , as we both agree ) . 
  i fail to see how anyone , after discussing these points - is * pro-conscription * . 
  is it a sense of nationalism ? 
  you do realize that a lot of that stuff is used to divide and conquer ( in a meta-sense ) and used as a political tool to incite large movements and events ? 
   finally , sure the us has a `` bad ass military '' , the most powerful in the world . 
  still its personnel is made up , in larger quantities , of the poor and minorities , than what is true of the us society in general . 
  therefore when the us goes to war , the people that end up dying are not the sons of the middle class and the rich , as much as it is the sons of the poor . 
  i 'm still waiting to see how this would change with conscription . 
  surely the political elite will find a way to avoid such a scenario ( as well as their children ) just as they always do . 
  how would this be enforced ? 
  is it by income ? 
  by what standards do you begin to ensure this policy is enacted equally among all its citizenry ? 
  and what about the real and present danger to liberties of citizens who do not desire such a policy ? 
  are we not in a democracy ? 
  such a large change in policy should certainly include their input on the matter ( which appears to be the case , as more than a quarter of swedes desire no such policy ) . 
  ... is this the part where you tell me democracy is a mob-rule scenario ? 
  i also have a pretty sweet beard in the wintertimes , and enjoy the comeback of flannel material ( specifically new england , regionally ) . 
  i also tend to drink to much and embarrass myself , but think nothing of it really . 
   that mechanism would be conscription ... unless you think that the corruption shown during the vietnam war , where the rich got out of serving in larger numbers than what was true for the poorer conscripts , is endemic .
