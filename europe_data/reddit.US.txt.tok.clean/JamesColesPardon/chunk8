  it is not though . 
  you misunderstand . 
  i am looking for the mechanism which would ensure the following : ( your words , my emphasis ) :  what about this then ; in a democratic society with conscription ** the cost of aggression will be born by all the layers of society close to equally . 
  **  as to the disparaging of armed services , i stand by that . 
  they are indeed represented by the poor and disenfranchised in larger numbers then society at large . 
  take a look at your own armed services . 
  i 'm from * america * , man . 
  we spend more on military than the next 16 nations * combined * . 
  despite my objections to how the usg uses the military ( almost every time , by the way ) , this monster that was created ( the us military-industrial complex ) is the baddest motherfucker on the planet . 
  we both know this . 
   as to them being dumb that is your own prejudice talking . 
  * i 'm prejudiced now * ? 
  do tell . 
   finally , is your end argument that it is easier for a political elite to wage war if it has a conscript army at its disposal ? 
  absolutely not . 
  how can this even be debated ? 
  this is n't even an argument - it 's like saying water is wet or 3 skyscrapers collapsed on 9/11 ( despite just two planes i guess ) . 
  it 's a fact . 
  american . 
  painfully mediocre but i 'm fun at parties . 
  i 'm cool if your cool . 
  as long as we alternate big and little spoon . 
  fair is fair , of course . 
  although you are probably taller than me , i 'm sure we can make it work logistically . 
   what about this then ; in a democratic society with conscription the cost of aggression will be born by all the layers of society close to equally . 
  i 'd love to see the mechanism for how this would be structured . 
   unlike a society with a purely professional army , where the poor or those with no other options for employment will bear a greater part of the burden . 
  way to disparage armed services everwhere ( most are poor , dumb , and have no other options ) eh ? 
   this makes it possible for the richer half to send the poorer segments to war with out having to bear much of the human cost . 
  or - you have a * free market * of those who wish to serve . 
  if the * richer elite class * dub a conflict worthy of military support - ** and the majority of the population state that no , they will not participate in such a policy ** , that the action is not feasible and the policy will be abandoned ( see us . 
  vs syria , chemical weapons , summer of 2013 for a recent example of this ) . 
  with conscription , i would argue the political elite class ( who exist in either scenario ) now would have support for any and all policies because to * not support it would be unlawful , leading to considerable pain not only for those forced to participate , but the civil penalties for excercising their free will * . 
   you 're talking as if conscription is some great slave driving torture horror show . 
  no , he 's not . 
  it 's about the freedom to not participate in something . 
  you boast above about how it 's important to be ready to defend the * homeland * - otherwise you 'd be stuck with an occupying power forcing you to fight * for them * and work * for them * or be put * in prison * . 
  when , in reality , this is the same aggressiveness you would be defending against , only it is not a foreign power - but a domestic one . 
  some would posit - what 's the difference ? 
  if 72 % want to participate - then * fuck yeah boys and girls have at it * . 
  but the other 28 % will be free to go about their day-to-day with liberty intact , and the other 72 % will be happy * serving their homeland * . 
  also - in wartime 100 % of the industry is not converted into military production . 
  other tasks will still need to be done . 
  what do you think the other 28 % would be doing ? 
  and instead of ramping up mikitary expensitures - why not invest in to finding out * why things are heating up * and work towards diplomatic solutions instead of more violence ? 
  every bomb dropped and bullet spent is less resources spent on feeding , clothing , and taking care of the rest of us , regardless of what side of a particular border * drawn long ago * we grew up on . 
  never forget that . 
  will you two get a room already ? 
  trading your anecdotal evidence back and forth is the most uninspiring foreplay of an internet argument ever . 
  it worked for iran ** because the cia engineered a coup of their demicratically elected leader ** to help the brit 's with the prospect of iranian oil field profits going to benefit the people , not british petroleum . 
  well , we all know that peoples ' perceptions can be manipulated ( and it has been throughout history ) . 
  maybe that should have been more eloquently stated above . 
  so if it is perceived - * this inherently means that this is not currently an issue * , but a manufactured one . 
  why legislate against something that is not a problem ? 
  is there a trend ? 
  sounds like this is unnecessary then . 
  why have n't they without these rules , then ? 
  something 's something 's nato encirclement . 
   tell that to the ~ ~ indians . ~ ~ native americans . 
  ... and we do n't like talking about it . 
  so there . 
  they scare so easily , these * crowds * . 
  exactly . 
  well , aparently saying you * feel like * someone accused of terrorism is illegal ? 
  that was [ news to me ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/02/10/384959376/the-french-debate-free-speech-versus-hate-speech ) :  one of those arrested in the wake of the attacks was controversial stand-up comedian dieudonne m'bala m'bala . 
  last wednesday , a judge ordered him to pay the equivalent of a $ 37,000 fine for condoning terrorism . 
   this time it was for posting `` i feel like charlie coulibaly '' on his facebook page . 
  the judge said dieudonne 's remark was clear support for amedy coulibaly , the gunman who killed a police officer and four people in a kosher grocery store . 
  know what i mean ? 
  because france 's laws , democracy , secular values , its way of life , are the total antithesis of what isis want . 
  you mean the * national emergency * that was extended for * 3 months * , ensuring more executive level power and prohibiting protests ? 
  allowing for unannounced raids of people 's homes * because terrorism * ? 
  and let 's not even discuss the lack of free speech . 
  seems like a shitty example of western values \u00a9 to target . 
  because france is one of the rare to really stand against them , at home against the ones who 'd like to introduce sharia law over human rights , and abroad , on their ` land '' . 
  examples ? 
  sounds like all this security we 're paying for is just theater !, 
  this is n't your backyard . 
   you defend russia as a matter of default :  1 . https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3qy0ba/russian_passenger_aircraft_with_220_onboard_goes/cwjgxjk  2 . https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3vpcxl/assad_says_britains_syria_strikes_illegal_will/cxqam55  3 . https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3q4wth/tony_blair_concedes_link_between_islamic_state/cwc6byh none of those ( highly upvoted ) comments linking to * credible sources * show me defending russia * by default * . 
  it just the ` legality ' of airstrikes whether or not you are russian , french , american , or british , in the eyes of the syrian government/people . 
   and ... you admit you 're a conspiracy theorist :  https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/3vb4n5/why_did_turkey_shoot_down_the_russian_jet/cxlyzv3?context=3  what credibility does a self-admitted conspiracy theorist have ? 
  who cares what you or i call myself?stay on topic - because all of these ad hominems and petty name calling is n't looking as good as you think it does . 
  if i were affected by these labels - do n't you think i would have used a different account ? 
  ... how much of my user history have you gone through yet ? 
  because you say you 're european but are awfully active at other ( nyc ) business hours . 
  interesting , is n't it ? 
    their reputation and reliability are exactly what i weigh when i determine whether or not an input is worthy to follow . 
   except , you and other cranks do n't determine what reliable sources are sure i do . 
  who else can determine truth but oneself ? 
  i do not take what you , eliot , washington or what moscow says as credible until * i * determine their worth . 
   because you have no clue whatsoever . 
    ela is fun to talk about , but to use it to blame whole countries for conflicts is both silly and irresponsible . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straw_man is n't ela this guy 's thing ? 
  how is it a strawman ? 
   also , the photos were subsequently proven false by studying the original satellite photos , which you will also deny , because you are an epistemological solipsist , meaning that because you deny reality selectively , you do n't get to make any claims whatsoever , because they can be dismissed by your own standard of selective reality . 
    i already spoke of bellingcat 's ( el ) analysis . 
   and you said absolutely nothing worth taking into consideration . 
  * `` my government worked with eliot and you 're stupid * '' is all you seem to be saying . 
   neither am i. i 'm european . 
  i actually belong here .
