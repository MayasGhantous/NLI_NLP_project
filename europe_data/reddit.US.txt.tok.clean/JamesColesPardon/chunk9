  oh - some eurocentric talk , finally . 
  i thought * open borders * was your thing ? 
  how dare you turn away a ~ ~ refugee ~ ~ migrant !, 
    so , in your view , america ( and the west ) do ** not ** propagandize their citizens ? 
  how am i infatuated with the russian regime ? 
  i guess that 's a yes . 
  you 're somebody 's citizen . 
  we all are . 
   we were `` done '' the moment you decided you could pick and choose which sources you 'd like , without taking into account their reputation and reliability . 
  their reputation and reliability are * exactly * what i weigh when i determine whether or not an input is worthy to follow . 
  bellingcat is n't one of them for me . 
  ela is fun to talk about , but to use it to blame whole countries for conflicts is both silly and irresponsible . 
   everything bellincat does , you can verify and do yourself , so you 're stuck being an epistemological solipsist : denying the existence , validity and integrity of data painfully exposed by the sloppiness of russian perpetrators and their weak-minded apologists . 
  i already spoke of bellingcat 's ( el ) analysis . 
   i find this pathetic and contemptible . 
  obviously . 
  i 'm not going anywhere , though . 
   and i know you replied because that characterization hit the sweat spot . 
  hmm ? 
  so , in your view , america ( and the west ) do ** not ** propagandize their citizens ? 
  no need for name calling , citizen . 
  if you ca n't see how easy it is for an operation for bellingcat can be co-opted or manipulated , i guess we 're done here . 
  you 're cute . 
  all countries propagandize to a degree . 
  why bring rt/sputnik into the conversation ? 
  i did n't cite any of those ( for good reason ) . 
  you 're not the boss of me , and i 've read plenty of books on the subject . 
  sure . 
  it 's propaganda . 
  because their homeland is likely at war ? 
  i 'd love a link or two ( if not english i 'm sure i can get some translation mojo to help ) ... 
  it sounds like you are describing pets , not people . 
  exactly . 
  limit what people can say ... and eventually you can limit what you can think . 
  so are russian pilots expected to understand english warnings ? 
  what percentage of turkey speaks english ? 
  do they use it for all official communications ? 
  . . maybe this is why the russian pilot is saying he never received a warning ? 
  404 on the link . 
  ... and why was it in english ? 
  ... why is it in english ? 
  why is turkey warning russian pilots to * en garde * ** in english ** ? 
  hatespeech laws go against freedom of speech . 
  you agreed to this . 
  now you got ta deal with the power creep . 
  someday . 
  i care about the silencing effect it has . 
  pointing out grammar and spelling mistakes ( as well as relating any tactics to sovietness , like whataboutism \u00a9 ) are signs that you are not losing an internet argument . 
  oh , and censorship via downvotes too . 
  r/europe tis a silly place . 
  it seems to me that you can both ** not ** be a euroskeptic ( whatever that means ) as well as put your national interests ahead of the political elite in brussels . 
  * details ... *, 
  one can only hope . 
  i 'm certainly not reading any brookings inatitute propaganda . 
  convince yourself all you want that isis is the big bad boogey man you should fear . 
  i just hope you know what you 're doing . 
  they 're either : 1 . 
  different legal entities/groups and the men and women running the world powers know their distinctions 2 . 
  their ambiguity are meant to confuse us all and it is in it itself a neurloginuistic programming technique 3 . 
  i 'm making mountains out of molehills . 
    a state of emergency my entire life  2001 . 
   wow i feel old no , just ignorant of things . 
  [ usa today 2014 ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/10/22/president-obama-states-of-emergency/16851775/ ) :  the united states is in a perpetual state of national emergency . 
   thirty separate emergencies , in fact . 
   ** an emergency declared by president jimmy carter on the 10th day of the iranian hostage crisis in 1979 remains in effect almost 35 years later . 
  **  a post-9 / 11 state of national emergency declared by president george w. bush -- and renewed six times by president obama -- forms the legal basis for much of the war on terror . 
   tuesday , president obama informed congress he was extending another bush-era emergency for another year , saying `` widespread violence and atrocities '' in the democratic republic of congo `` pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the united states . '', 
   those emergencies , declared by the president by proclamation or executive order , give the president extraordinary powers -- to seize property , call up the national guard and hire and fire military officers at will . 
  get it ? 
  and if you think your new leader will relax any powers given ( * cough c51 cough * ) willingly - good luck with that . 
  the war we lost . 
  why does the media typically use one , the pentagon use one , and the international community use another ? 
  why would they do that though ? 
  why not carve out their territory more and solidify it ? 
  you gain nothing militarily by blowing shit up in europe . 
  getting nato and russia after you is not good policy . 
  isis ? 
  or isil ? 
  or is ? 
  or daesh ? 
  how many of these groups are armed by the us ? 
  ** you ** have to understand that these powers to invade your homes and raid your loved ones on the guise of terorrism are not a slippery slope - that part is done . 
  we 're off the cliff , baby , and the only way back is to climb up the mountain again . 
  my ancestors did 200-300 years ago , but i doubt the same thing will happen again . 
  unfortunately . 
  makes no sense . 
  why would they do this ? 
  ... when do you think the * war on terorrism * will be over ? 
  american here - we 've been in a state of emergency * my entire life * and at war with * terrorism * for half of it . 
  this has been going on now since the reichstag . 
  at least . 
  hunting for who , exactly ? 
  some iraqi ghost ? 
  it was a private us company , the site intelligence group , whose headquarters is in washinton dc who * confirmed it * . 
  thats some interesting doublespeak with the arab spring and iraq . 
  the protsters got subsidized electricity and some other minor concessions . 
  hardly a coup . 
  where is the proof on either case that is was any one group ? 
  the dutch safety board only reported on a `` high energy object , '' and there are plenty of dodgy pieces of evidence for the whole buk think being in ppssession of both the ukrainian rebels and ukraine 's militay forces themselves . 
  and now with this airbus thing e most i 've seen about it are coming from us and russian * intelligence services * , which should certainly raise an eyebrow to those paying attention and trying to get a handle on the big picture .
