  respect is only * really * demanded when it 's being given and not reciprocated . 
  imo unless something significant happens to turn u.s.-polish relations away from being so lopsided and cause genuine efforts from the u.s. to be a steadfast ally to poland , then poland would be far better off affiliating itself with the eu . 
  america would start a world war for england , france , germany , japan , or korea -- the only way it would do so for poland was if nato risked falling apart as a result . 
  on the other-hand , a strong and united europe * would * actually stand beside poland , for a number of reasons . 
  poland does more for the u.s. than it gets in return , all that poland really gets are promises -- oftentimes empty ones at that . 
  for example , even after poland 's ** very ** significant contributions to afghanistan and iraq , they were awarded none of the valuable reconstruction contracts they asked for , instead those contracts went to countries that either did n't contribute or contributed far less , such as chinese and french companies . 
  and everyone knows how america reneged on its missile shield plan , just to get some half-hearted statements of support from russia for sanctions on iran . 
  if you think that this will seriously impact u.s.-polish relations then you 're either completely uninformed on the reliance the two countries have on each other , or you 're a fool . 
  u.s. and polish interests will not be derailed by politicians speaking their minds in private -- and honestly sikorski kind of had a decent amount of truth to this statement and u.s. diplomats are likely to understand where he 's coming from . 
  the germans made it to the gates of moscow long before any significant front opened up in the west . 
  kursk was n't a `` close '' battle . 
  stalingrad was at one point `` close '' . 
  the siege of leningrad was at one point `` close '' . 
  kursk was such an overwhelming success for the soviets and their defense-in-depth approach that the furthest german advance into the soviet defenses did n't even get halfway through , and the entire 3rd line of soviet defense was untouched . 
  the only credit for a soviet victory at kursk that can be given to other nations is that the british `` ultra '' program provided the soviets with the information necessary to begin building their defenses in the kursk salient in anticipation of a large-scale german assault . 
  80 % of soviet war materiel was still produced in the ussr . 
  what was given to the soviets by the western allies had a very significant impact , but even without those supplies the ussr would likely still have won -- it would have just taken them even longer and would have cost them more lives , and been a closer call . 
  it was still soviet made t-34s , katyusha rockets , and mosin-nagants that did the vast brunt of the fighting , and soviet war production only kept growing after the initial invasion and never hit its peak . 
  [ no dude ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/post-22308-youre-not-wrong-youre-just-an-nj28.png ) , the whole point of * debate * is that it has to have some modicum of civility . 
  when you make it personal , throw pointless insults into the argument , and generally act very immature ** you alienate people and weaken your argument . 
  ** people get the impression that you 're incredibly immature and generally unintelligent if you do n't know how to be a part of a reasonable and rational debate . 
  so if you lack the intelligence to know how to be a part of a civil debate , why should they possibly assume that you know what you 're talking about when you try to convince them on the topic being discussed ? 
  quit being so damn defensive and understand that your personal , childish frustration and anger ** do n't actually matter as much as the argument you want to convey . 
  ** and since they do n't matter , you should man up and start engaging in civil debates -- a good first step would be to go back and edit your comment . 
  you brought up some excellent points and it pains me to see such a strong case that i agree with brought forward with that kind of hostility , which will only serve to weaken your argument and alienate people that would otherwise be educated . 
  tl ; dr -- quit being immature and idiotic , you 're clearly an intelligent guy so you 're better than that . 
  you make a good argument but you lose any potential support by being ** way ** too aggressive and vulgar with it . 
  completely uncalled for . 
  you 're right but nobody will care if you 're being a dick about it . 
  oh there is n't a chance in hell that russia could beat nato in a conflict . 
  the u.s. alone could defeat russia 5 times over . 
  oh definitely . 
  i go back to see family every couple of years and the situation is definitely rapidly improving -- but then again its also improving in cz , and the two countries still have pretty comparable roads overall ( though poland obviously has much more miles of roads ) . 
  he 's a member of the duma so official letters would be addressed as such , but going so far as to claim that he and his views are representative of the russian duma as a whole is ridiculous . 
  that 's not a partition though , that 's a hypothetical effort to secure what bit of ukrainian independence you can . 
  partition would mean that poland takes back historically polish territories such as lviv/lwow and directly annexes them as part of the polish nation -- the first is a reasonable reaction to a dire political/military situation , the second is a radical action that tries to recover something that was lost nearly 80 years ago and is no longer relevant to the politics , desires , and needs of the region . 
  sadly there are very few poles remaining there , they were all deported or killed ( my grandfather among them ) . 
  while poland should have never lost much of that territory the reality is that it ` s done and over with , like germany losing prussia . 
  acting on these historical injustices now would accomplish nothing but cause pointless conflict and further tragedy . 
  at the most , the ukrainian government should probably work to help polish citizens recover their family 's former properties and estates that were stolen , or offer recompense , but anything beyond that is completely unnecessary . 
  not really , no . 
  literally no logistics up there means the slightest mistake or malfunction in what is very demanding weather on unknown and untravelled flight paths results in aircraft falling out of the sky . 
  the distance is also pretty damn significant ( you 'd have to not only cross the entire arctic ocean and canada , but also compounding potential problems , fueling , organization , and making it very likely that we 'd detect the attack from satellites in space before it got to us ) , leaving no secure route back or for resupply other than back the way you came , which the distance makes impossible due to lack of fuel . 
  it 'd be a futile , unsupported , vastly inefficient one-way suicide mission . 
  that being said , it could be a potential avenue through which to send a small ( 1-2 planes ) infiltration force , small enough to avoid detection and designed to land somewhere in the upper canadian wilderness before proceeding on ground ( you could probably arrange for a vehicle to be available nearby through spies/operatives in canada , which i guarantee you russia has ) to their target/the american border . 
  not really sure what that small of a strike force would really hope to accomplish though , plus there are plenty of other tried and true methods the russians have for infiltrating their operatives into foreign nations ( including the u.s. , but we also have tried and true methods for smoking them out/minimizing their capabilities ) that are likely easier and more cost efficient than flying them over the north pole . 
  but hey what do i know , maybe that 's the way they 've been doing it for the past 60 years . 
  edit : misread your comment , thought you meant from siberia into north america . 
  the basic premise of my post still applies , just replace the roles and add the fact that there is even less in terms of infrastructure , people , and things to attack along the northern half of siberia than even the northern provinces of canada . 
  it 's not really even measuring when ours is so overwhelmingly larger and better , that literally every other nation in the world combined does n't match up . 
  that and the problems created by having an overextended supply-line that runs hundreds of miles through occupied territory , territory where the infrastructure was either largely destroyed in retreat or never existed , and was constantly subject to attack and sabotage by well-organized and powerful underground partisan organizations . 
  they also seemed to underestimate exactly how men and resources existed in the soviet union , or how tenaciously the regime would hold on and it 's people would fight when faced with annihilation . 
  the japanese made that same mistake in china . 
  hey , at least the roads exist . 
  when i was driving from the east coast of costa rica to the west , i had to drive on dirt paths up hills , through jungles , and numerous times through creeks and small rivers . 
  had the weather not been ideal that week those roads would have been impassible and certainly would not suffice for any sort of large-scale transportation of people or goods . 
  while [ this may be indicative ] ( http://img.radio.cz/pictures/doprava/derava_silnice.jpg ) of significant stretches of czech roads , this is still paved roadway that requires relatively simple refurbishment and reinforcement to allow for large-scale use . 
  not to mention that even with those potholes you can probably travel at more than 25 kilometers per hour if you need to get somewhere . 
  and while those roads may be rough , there are still significant stretches of [ well-developed highways ] ( http://www.ceskapozice.cz/sites/default/files/imagecache/full_size_content_image/d5_rsd.jpg ) that would be handling the bulk of transportation ( the vast majority of transportation would be between major population centers and airports , there would be little need for much traffic to head to smaller locales ) . 
  in the event of a broader and more dire escalation in eastern europe , those 50 extra fighters could easily either be recommissioned for training new recruits ( or put into active duty ) , or leased to nations like romania -- even sold to developing countries to help finance expansion of the armed forces . 
  on our 12 available aircraft carriers ( 3 more on the way ) . 
  russia has 1 . 
  honestly , if a conflict as significant as war with russia were to break out ( basically wwiii ) , i would n't be worried about the logistics of the conflict being figured out . 
  just look at the massive-scale mobilizations of troops , armaments , supplies , civilians , factories , ships , planes , etc that were accomplished during wwii -- the logistics of it boggles the mind . 
  and mind you this was all accomplished before we had computers ( or even calculators ) , helicopters , anywhere near the level of infrastructure ( of any kind ) that we have now , gps , satellites , countless technologies hell the list goes on and on . 
  if the u.s. could somehow coordinate the massive overhaul of it 's industry , manufacture and supply billions of tons of supplies and war-materiel to war zones thousands of miles away , coordinate overwhelmingly huge bombing campaigns of europe across the atlantic , not to mention coordinate the worlds largest amphibious invasion ( they built entire prefabricated ports ) ; if germany could coordinate an invasion of 4 million troops across an 1,800 mile front , and if the ussr could coordinate the dismantlement and evacuation of * entire factories * in the wake of german advance thousands of miles east , and then mobilize soldiers a continent away across inhospitable wasteland , numbering in the tens of millions to fight back an invasion -- i 'm pretty sure with our modern technology , logistics , populations , and economies we could figure out how to supply any number of modern jet fighters . 
  i 've been to the czech republic several times , and yeah the roads are definitely worse compared to western europe and the united states . 
  then again the roads are pretty comparable to the roads in poland and hungary , and do exist in adequate form for transporting people and goods across the country . 
  compared to the roads i encountered in places like costa rica and se asia though , the czech republic definitely has what can be considered `` modern '' infrastructure that would suffice for mobilization and transportation of militaries and their supplies . 
  not to mention that with every large-scale mobilization of troops a large amount of effort is put into bolstering local infrastructure ( you 'd be surprised at how quickly the u.s. army corps of engineers can turn an shitty road into one that can transport entire divisions along it when the need arises ; if they can work miracles in afghanistan then they can sure as hell fix up the roads in the czech republic ) . 
   and czech republic ( public & most politicians ) have exactly zero wish to participate in any conflict . 
  do n't mistake empty words for actions . 
  that may be so , but as a member of nato the czech republic is bound under no uncertain terms to treat an attack on one nato nation as an attack on itself . 
  should war break out and a member of nato be attacked , i guarantee you that regardless of public opposition to war , czech military forces would be deployed to at least the minimum extent necessary to meet it 's obligations under nato requirements . 
  forfeiting on nato obligations after a member is attacked would have massive repercussions and consequences for the czech republic ( like it would for any nato ally ) as it would directly renege on a multitude of well-defined international obligations ; drastically inhibit if not destroy its international diplomatic reputation -- as well as ruin it 's relations with virtually every other nato country ( unless they too reneged on their obligations ) ; would leave the czech republic without any aid , backing , and support from nato countries not only militarily ( which would leave it completely on it 's own in the event that war reached it ) but also economically and diplomatically ( after going back on as binding an obligation as nato , you can bet that virtually all nato members would cut off or suspend economic treaties with the czech republic as punishment and due to lack of trust ) ; would cause intense division in the czech government and military ; and even potentially open up the czech republic to sanctions and in the case of a hypothetical eastern european war , military action by nato in order to secure vital strategic interests in the region . 
  if a massive ground war between nato and a resurgent russia broke out then the czech republic would gain little from refusing to join the fight as inevitably the fight would be brought to them regardless , and then it would have only earned the overwhelming enmity of most of the rest of europe as well as the united states , canada , and australia for reneging on it 's treaties and weakening the solidarity of nato in the face of violent aggression . 
  and do n't underestimate the effect that conflict close to home can have on the opinions of the people . 
  maybe the czechs are opposed to any conflict now , but if russia were to start attacking nato members in eastern europe ( as highly unlikely as that is ) i can almost guarantee that support for war against russia would grow very significantly in the czech republic . 
  being from poland myself , and having spent significant time in the czech republic , knowing it 's history and the czech people 's knowledge of what eastern domination was like , i firmly believe that the majority of czechs would quickly rise to the occasion and recognize the necessity of action against resurgent russian imperialism . 
  well obviously as a part of the visegrad group the czech republic is bound by alliances with poland , slovakia , and hungary ( all of which share borders with ukraine ) to come to their aid in case of an attack . 
  not to mention it being a part of nato which means it is likewise again bound to provide military aid to the aforementioned countries , as well as the other eastern european nato nations of romania , bulgaria , latvia , lithuania , and estonia . 
  this really is n't exactly `` new '' information , this is all a given . 
  also , with it 's relatively small air force ( only 163 total aircraft/helicopters , and as splergel laid out below only 31 combat-ready fighter jets and 12 attack helicopters ) the czech republic would n't really lead a hypothetical eastern european defense effort nor would it contribute all that much with it 's military -- poland would be the country to take the lead ( obviously after the u.s. ) considering it 's not only much more substantial military ( poland has invested much more in bolstering , training , and supplying it 's troops with up-to-date hardware than any other eastern european nation since the fall of the ussr ) , but also the level of experience that polish troops and their command have both in combat situations ( due to poland 's very significant contributions to the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan as well as numerous other operations in bosnia , kosovo , haiti , pakistan , lebanon , the first gulf war , etc ) and in coordinating efforts/working together with major nato armed forces , notably the u.s. , uk , australia , france , germany , canada , and italy -- which in a hypothetical war in eastern europe would be vital . 
  however where the czech republic would provide the most amount of aid is through logistics , by providing western nations with an excellent staging ground and avenue through which to move troops , supplies , and coordinate military operations . 
  the czech republic has even more serviceable airports than it 's neighbor poland , combined with modern infrastructure and highway , as well as the fact that due to it 's location and geography it would not be an battle-zone ( though it is still further east than germany ) make it an excellent candidate for the aforementioned roles . 
  i never said that her passport was forced to include her ethnicity in it , but it did and it does . 
  and the fact that they used that to influence their decision ( they literally told her so ) is utterly reprehensible . 
  and she had been guaranteed a relatively comfortable pension from her work as a civil engineer ( she managed a relatively large team , worked her whole life as a professional in a difficult field , not just ordinary work ) and this larger pension was exactly what she went to apply for and was denied exclusively because of her ethnicity . 
  she even remembers explicitly how everything was going great and the person processing her documents said that she fit the criteria perfectly , right up until they read her ethnicity , asked to be excused to speak with their boss , and came back and told my grandmother to leave because they would not be offering this pension to `` russians '' . 
  my grandmother left crying . 
   as many jews were considered soviet collaborators this was a common excuse used to murder jews , argued not only by latvians but also by lithuanians , ukrainians , and even some eastern poles . 
  jews were no more likely to work with soviet authorities than any other ethnic group , this was hysteria born of antisemitism propagated by many right-wing groups ( not only the nazis ) that the ussr was led by jews . 
  it does absolutely nothing to excuse the actions of those right-wing groups . 
  it is misguided of you to say that they only attacked jews because they were trying to attack `` soviet collaborators '' . 
  i was born in poland , most of my family is polish , i spent half my life there , i 've studied poland . 
  everything you say about the `` baltic mentality '' applies itself twice as much to the poles , who were deported in even greater numbers to siberia by russians and soviets for some 200 + years . 
  one of my grandparents actually grew up near yakutsk in a gulag camp , and did n't leave siberia until he was 22 years old ( he was 5 when the soviets annexed what is now lithuania and deported his family ) . 
  two others were deported and chased out of their homes in what used to be eastern poland by their soviet supported ukrainian neighbors who murdered more than 300,000 poles in the massacres of galicia and volhynia . 
  all of them suffered for another 40 years under soviet oppression . 
  my father was nearly beaten to death by communist forces when he marched in the solidarity movement .
