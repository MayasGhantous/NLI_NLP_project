  all of belgium ? 
  oil . 
  reddish flag ? 
  they used to own 1/3 of the u.s. too . 
  french is still a 1st or 2nd language in a small number of communities . 
  it 's the exchange students that perplex me . 
  we have a lot of germans and scandinavians that come here , they basically turn into joyous sun-worshiping hedonists . 
  but the romance language speakers seem absolutely depressed most of the time . 
  i 'm not fluent , but every once in a while i 'll overhear francophone tourists and students doing their shopping and complaining about everything . 
  a military is a reflection of the society that produces it . 
  i 'm not saying it will all necessarily be negative but you ca n't foresee what will happen . 
  i do n't know how to say lebensraum in russian . 
  good luck with age-related fertility problems , social changes due to longer lifespans , universal access to said treatments , the economy , the social welfare system , the military , the slowly increasing fertility rate in russia ... 
  as much as latvia may need to upgrade their capabilities , they either need nato or europe to guarantee their security . 
  you either have to make babies or settle migrants . 
  those are the only ways to sustain growth . 
  living longer just gives you an older population . 
   a quarter of europe 's people are already aged 60 or more ; by 2050 deaths will outnumber births by 32m . 
  the un warns that only migration will prevent the region 's population from shrinking further . 
  already working on it !, 
  africa has a billion people and massive public health problems . 
  if they 're growing now they 're only going to keep growing as the states and economies become more developed . 
  unless there 's a massive shift in societies and family structure it 's not going to slow down . 
  we 're also talking about a continent of more than 50 nations . 
  i think they meant the whole occupation and warsaw getting bombed to rubble thing . 
  it was a joke . 
  the nazis copied part of my state 's eugenics program , we 're all fucked up . 
  do n't look up the history of vw ... 
  assemble the golden reindeer horde . 
  i did n't make the map . 
  i was n't making a point i was just curious ... 
  did some google , my county ( san diego county ) has more people than lithuania and is slightly larger than cyprus but slightly smaller than montenegro . 
  weird . 
  california is roughly the size of sweden and has more people than poland . 
   having the capital in a city full of nuclear missiles !, 
  france and scotland would like to have a word . 
  if it makes you feel better , this is what a [ brit did to the u.s. ] ( http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2013-11/enhanced/webdr03/26/7/enhanced-buzz-wide-25610-1385467469-21.jpg ), 
  used to be called east prussia until the mid 1940 's . 
  belarus is just jealous and spreads disinformation about its location . 
  west slav best slav . 
  buzzfeed did one a fill in the map thing , [ this is the best anyone did .

  it 's a fair bet that the vast majority of americans do n't know what or where kaliningrad is . 
  or that corsica exists and is french . 
  turkey = terrifying prisons the netherlands = amsterdam with some windmills , dikes , and flowers . 
  rest of it looks about right . 
  putin has promised to give back ostpreu\u00dfen if they do n't interfere in the internal matters of the union of slavic soldarian republics . 
  not really , they serve an entirely different constitutional role . 
  the upper house of a legislature is usually seen as a check on the more populist lower house . 
  part of the reason some of them are appointed and not elected . 
  it 's also the reason u.s. 
  senators have longer terms in office than representatives . 
  snoop is protected under admiralty law , everything within a 3-foot radius of his person is considered international waters . 
  i think the idea is that they do n't have to worry about reelection so they 're more inclined to work in the best interests of the country . 
  in the u.s. we used to have our senators appointed by state governments for similar reasons . 
  they 've been getting rid of a lot of the hereditary peers and moving to life peers if i recall correctly . 
  it was the first step in reforms that have n't been fully realized . 
  turkey and greece and british sovereign bases never forget glorious cyprus . 
  that 's what you get for not exploiting the family size eco-friendly panzer market .

  it can happen with any insular community . 
  here in the states it has become a problem in orthodox jewish communities and , though somewhat of a different case , the amish . 
  schmetterling !, 
  and a dumbed-down export version of course . 
  and people say the german language is n't fun . 
  i was mostly going for the play on words with char . 
  not every day you get to make a multicultural charlemagne tank pun lol . 
  introducing the kampfpanzer char-lemagne . 
  it 's literally linking to a different article now . 
  it was updated again 5 minutes ago . 
  no , the link now goes to a different article . 
  this post is from 2 hours ago , if you look at the article it links to now it says it was posted 20 minutes ago . 
  greeks would n't like it , too much macedonia going on . 
  rocket scientists and and a bunch of people that did n't want to live in new russia . 
  you mean the guy in charge of the british army ? 
  and complain about glorious russian mediterranean fleet instead . 
  [ the hapsburgs are still around . 
  it looks like they were from the urals and then invaded the area that 's now hungary . 
  doing some reading , people thought they were descended from huns for a long time , but they actually come from a different language group . 
  magyars , it 's what hungarians call themselves . 
  generally from the same area , but a different people . 
   police matter [ good thinking , britain . 
  ] ( http://image.slidesharecdn.com/koreanwar-150120111334-conversion-gate02/95/korean-war-8-638.jpg?cb=1421774048 ) they 'll never see it coming . 
  hell , i think it was in a vice documentary a few years back . 
  gornja mao\u010da from 2012 : https://youtu.be/rat1kthcgo0?t=201, 
  the vast majority of the early settlers ( not counting african slaves ) were english , scottish , and irish . 
  and u.s. domestic history is far from peaceful . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_incidents_of_civil_unrest_in_colonial_north_america https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_incidents_of_civil_unrest_in_the_united_states, 
  states still have a shit ton of rights , but they do n't have slaves anymore . 
  net gain of freedom !, 
  `` most . '', 
  and it was quite true for a long period of time . 
  though quite a few of the `` british '' settlers were disgruntled scots and irish , some of whom ended up fighting a small rebellion about whiskey taxes of all things ... 
   french and german establishment that 's actually been a very interesting thing to watch . 
  it does n't get much coverage over here . 
  lol you 'd be surprised at how being a `` white english-speaking protestant '' counted as culture . 
  still does in some unfortunate circles ... what you 're describing sounds more like the difference between the eu and the eurozone today than anything else . 
  right now it 's just a very informal arrangement . 
  i did n't mean to imply that anyone would be made to join by force , it 's those civil wars of secession that get you . 
  but yeah , it will probably be boring .
