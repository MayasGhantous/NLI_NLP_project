  granted , our shitshows make up most of the ... well everything in the news around here . 
  and i blame reddit for how much i know about your last general election ... 
  poor estonia ... 
  you and ireland should dig up some viking ships and claim your rights . 
  if i remembered i would have posted it already . 
  it was a piece by an economist that worked during the breakup of the ussr and was critical of the western response to russia 's economic situation . 
  that 's not exactly implausible nor something i would necessarily save for future discussions on reddit ... 
  that would be a logical argument , which unfortunately is n't used very often . 
  it 's the accent , not the grammar . 
  belgians just sound nicer . 
  it 's not my view , i said it was something i read . 
  it was a joke . 
   russia had it better than most ex-soviet states . 
  that was the argument though , the actual soviet states got `` let down '' while the central european and baltic states got tangible assistance . 
  not saying it 's 100 % correct , just another point of view . 
  it 's almost always a religious argument . 
  maybe the cold war was all a transcription error . 
  i remember reading something saying they privatized too quickly and were n't offered the same assistance that other post-soviet nations got , which they were counting on . 
  i think the main comparison was to look at the difference between the way poland was handled versus what russia got . 
   or just angry at life . 
  anglos , anglos everywhere . 
  i 'd say they consider quebec to be a nation , and themselves to be ethnically and/or culturally french . 
  the brits may have damaged them during the adoption process ... 
  obviously latvian soldiers on vacation trying to annex the hermitage . 
  while they may be immigrants , there 's a difference between hungarian citizens and ethnic hungarians . 
  i know with the western slavic languages they 're somewhat mutually intelligible . 
  my grandma used to tell me about her parents being able to speak between czechs , slovaks , and poles without really knowing the other languages . 
  quebec has a very rural quality too it , and i ca n't understand half of it even when they 're speaking standard french . 
  i usually understand belgians with the least difficulty . 
  on to the hard part , our dumbass congress ... 
  something something treaty of versailles something german colonial empire, 
  steak-frites !, 
  how nice for you . 
  oh my most sincere apologies , i just happened to move my mouse over your username when i was clicking on the article . 
  `` argentina is white '' piqued my curiosity . 
  what a wonderfully hateful post history you have . 
  hey , louis xvi . 
  thanks for the help with that whole revolution thing . 
  but did you really not see that backfiring ? 
  did we just kill greece to get half-life 3 ? 
  sometimes i wish the u.s. government could be kicked in the ass as often as some european nations seem to do . 
  but on the other hand it 's honestly a bit frightening . 
  there 's a difference between the single market and the euro . 
  and while they are intimately connected , the eurozone is basically a separate entity entirely . 
  when you say you do n't expect others to be equally responsible , it drastically contrasts with the article in question . 
   the economic union does n't end at the eurozone borders . 
  maybe it should ? 
  you have a monetary federation within a larger political confederation , and the monetary federation is basically in charge . 
  the non-eurozone members do n't appear to be equal partners . 
  i do n't think most people would say they want to sink a country , but this is about more than greece . 
  all of this is redefining the relationships between member states in the eu , and the brits were n't exactly in love with it in the first place . 
  tenure at wherever he is or ends up teaching , more fellowships , maybe a talk show . 
  if british conservatives really want out of the eu , this is like a wet dream . 
  if they do n't want out , this is going to be interesting . 
  in either case [ ... ] ( https://1w4ip62tb8kd3adq97eiq9j1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1409959005359_wps_21_nigel_farage_leader_of_uk.jpg ), 
  merkel was n't elected head of the eurozone , everyone shares responsibility . 
   at 8:00 am on 1 august , a georgian police lorry was blown up by an improvised explosive device on the road near tskhinvali , injuring five georgian policemen . 
  in response , south ossetian border checkpoints were assaulted by georgian snipers during the evening , killing four ossetians and injuring seven . 
  [ 99 ]  ossetian separatists began intensively shelling georgian villages on 1 august at the earliest , [ clarification needed ] with a sporadic response from georgian peacekeepers and other troops in the region . 
  [ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ] [ 30 ] [ 52 ] [ 103 ] during the night of 1/2 august , grenades and mortar fire were exchanged . 
  the number of ossetians casualties rose to six , and the number of injured to fifteen , including several civilians ; the georgian casualties were six injured civilians and one injured policeman . 
  [ 99 ] according to the osce mission , the incident was the worst outbreak of violence since 2004 . 
  [ 104 ] on 2 -- 3 and again on 3 -- 4 august , firing recommenced during the night . 
  [ 104 ] a 1992 ceasefire agreement was breached by the use of heavy weapons against the georgian villages . 
  nonono , the last war was war of georgian aggression that had nothing to do with the russian-backed breakaway republics getting uppity . 
  you mean the part where georgia tried to take back its own territory and the russians invaded , kicked out ethnic georgians , and set up military bases ? 
  hollande said they 'll extend the maturities . 
  sounds like some are going to be sold off outright , others will be run to make a profit until they hit whatever benchmark to get the rest of the bailout money . 
  it was in the announcement by eurogroup leader jeroen dijsselbloem . 
  `` assets will be transferred to a fund to be set up . 
  the fund will monetise them by privatisation or running them . 
  it will be used to help recapitalise banks . '', 
  they said the fund will be in greece , i guess that matters ? 
  bbc just posted this : `` his labour minister , panos skourletis , has said on greek television that it could be a hard sell for the prime minister 's own anti-austerity syriza party . 
  `` right now there is an issue of a governmental majority [ in parliament ] , '' skourletis said on ert . 
  `` i can not easily blame anyone who can not say ` yes ' to this deal . '', 
  `` we are n't trying to make this deal look better , and we are saying it clearly : this deal is not us , '' he added . '', 
  [ `` so eurozone and greece have done a deal . 
  but let 's not blithely assume terms will be acceptable greek parliament #greececrisis '' ] ( https://twitter.com/peston/status/620487839587942401 ), 
  the cyprus pm just tweeted `` final lap on . '', 
  and then `` deal '' luxembourg : `` after 17h of negotiations we are close to an agreement . 
  europe is strong . '', 
   `` his labour minister , panos skourletis , has said on greek television that it could be a hard sell for the prime minister 's own anti-austerity syriza party .

  saying reforms have to be passed by wednesday . 
  greek minister saying they 're being blackmailed . 
  merkel says no debt relief . 
  how much do you like owning those islands ? 
  i read somewhere that poland has more german tanks in service than germany does now . 
  oh i agree , but some parallels are there . 
  i honestly have nothing but respect for the people trying to make the eu work in light of what happened in the last century . 
  it just seems like nobody can decide whether they want a loose confederation or a strong federation and are trying to do both at once . 
  the u.s. did n't have fun figuring that one out . 
  got it . 
  it really is an odd situation to say the least . 
  i mean that 's kind of how these things work , rich states subsidize poor states . 
  the difference here is that you 're dealing with sovereign nations instead of constituent member states of a strong federation . 
  it honestly reminds me of the u.s. under the articles of confederation , we ended up with a strong central government and a civil war , which lead to an even stronger central government .
