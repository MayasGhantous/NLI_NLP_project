a week ago they were bragging that they could take 500k per year lol, 
  props to brave feminists for exposing those sick chauvinistic cultists !, 
  you 're welcome !, 
  god bless our troops !, 
  is spain a western democracy ? 
  guess not ... 
  left-wing pinheads traveling across europe to vandalize other people 's hard-earned property . 
  why am i not surprised ... 
  well , golly gee , captain obvious , thanks for explaining this !, 
  everything has magically changed since 2011 . 
  k lol here , a more recent social research study published 2014 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s1877042814000305  abstract  in this study , i examined the social problems lgbt individuals go through in their hometowns and later , in the places they move to . 
  data were collected using semistructured interviews that included thirty four open - and close-ended questions . 
    the sample is compsosed of 18 male and 12 female participants which makes 30 in total , residing in any city in turkey . 
  the findings demonstrate that lgbt individuals are exposed to verbal harassment and physical abuse , they are not accepted and are not able to perform social activities in their hometowns or if they migrated , in the places they moved to . 
   i 'm eagerly looking forward to your next excuse ;-), 
  so amnesty international and numerous other article reporting on the rampant violence against lgbt are wrong ? 
  please ... https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2011/06/turkey-must-take-action-over-lgbt-discrimination/ http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/12/turkey-honor-killings_n_1007335.html#s404121 http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/06/21/turkey-accused-of-ignoring-violence-against-gays/, 
  i know that recently they sent out the riot police to stop a gay pride parade . 
  proof me wrong . 
  try this in turkey and you will get severely hurt . 
  never go full varoufakis !, 
  translation : `` please save the french banks '', 
  if you tell a joke in german , is it still a joke ? 
  the most likely truth is that germany planned to keep greece in the euro all along to impose their power through it . 
  pushing greece to the edge and the imminent threat of a grexit was just a means to get the best deal possible . 
  at the end , syriza got played like a fiddle . 
  the banks always win . 
  congratulations to the 60 % of greek people for refusing to take any responsibility for anything !, 
   now he walks back in there , and the people across the table know he 's not going anywhere for months . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  i see greek leaving ez in a couple of weeks . 
  `` we have you 're money and we wo n't pay it back , suckers ! '', 
  democracy has spoken !, 
  oh wait , it 's only 85 % of those 80 million germans . 
  that does n't count , because 65 % of 10 million greeks say otherwise !, 
  i hope the greek people are smart enough and leave the euro . 
  otherwise , they will arrive at the same dead end a couple of months/years from now . 
  first , cuba 's isolation was not by choice but enforced and stipulated through the us . 
  secondly , if the greek people want to recover within the euro they will arrive at the same dead end a couple of months/years from now . 
  that 's not an unsolvable problem , . e.g , most of the us agricultural land would be desert without irrigation . 
  i suppose eu and international salvation organisations will help them during the transitional period to a more more agrarian and rural-centric economy . 
  thanks to the usage of drachma instead of euro producing their own food will become economically viable again . 
  not necessarily . 
  greece will probably become something like europe 's cuba and the people who are living there are in average more happy than the average american citizen . 
  no wins !, 
  looks like greece will become soon a very cheap country for vacation :-), 
  op is a good showcase why the eu and greece are better off without each other . 
  global warming is a hoax !, 
  oh wait , those are celsius values !, 
  was he drunk ? 
  there are several comments on / r/europe per day that are more coherent and eloquently written . 
  vote no !, 
  that will show them !, 
  merkel says no dice . 
  seems like tsipras and v have to lay in that bed they made for themselves . 
  i 'm sincerely sorry to hear that and hope it will somehow work out for you and ordinary greek people in general , who are clearly the biggest victims of this development . 
  brave guy . 
  i hope he knows that greece will blame him for their default if his campaign fails . 
  not bad , but you still have twice the gdp than greece . 
  hence , your relative debt is much lower . 
  there is a realistic chance that greece leaves the emu and eu . 
  hence , since you 're still an eu citizen you 're eligible to permanently relocate and work in france , uk , germany , etc. 
  i would recommend to use that option while you still have it . 
  you clearly do n't know anything about us . 
  come back when you 've managed to borrow 380bn eur and then conveniently default . 
  welcome to mother russia , my greek comrades !, 
  the sooner they 're gone the better for both sides . 
  it never has been more obvious . 
  shut up poorer eu states , because you do n't make such a loud case for being a special snow-flake like greece does and you do n't have systemic embezzlement of that magnitude . 
  do n't be so intolerant !, 
  just buy a burka for your wife and daughters !, 
  ironically , like icarus he falls victim to his own hubris . 
  varoufakis 's game theory panning out greatly : http://pbs.twimg.com/media/cihhhybuyaaifoi.jpg, 
  it was tsipras who ended the negotiations unilaterally and abruptly and , hence , their is no finger-pointing this time . 
  the greek government screwed up big time . 
  time for the greek ppl to get rid of this government to save their own and their children 's future . 
  what is this ? 
  medieval saber rattling ? 
  he said the anglo-saxons would try to break up the ez not ( ! ), 
  the eu . 
  but even that is baseless fear-mongering at best , esp . 
  when considering the us government 's huge interest in ttip . 
  so much salt . 
  that scary polish willingness to work hard !, 
  the west polish men are just getting those german broom sticks to return later . 
  [ because nigel farage is clearly sent by god himself to protect humanity against the eu !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30jl48/nigel_farage_sent_by_godapparently/ ), 
  another masterpiece , bravo !, 
  esa should hire jeremy clarkson and company to present their space news !, 
  i did n't know that napoleon dynamite 's brother , kip , has become an ultra-nationalistic russian : https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2413004564/image.jpg vs http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1391568/igor-strelkov.jpg?w=736, 
  `` for the honor of zeus and gyros kebab i demand satisfaction !, 
  down with the merkeltaur ! '', 
  south africa should claim compensations for german war crimes immediately !, 
   of course you do , it 's not like you could get any further . 
  k.uwin.thxbai ;-), 
   germany has very strict medical confidentiality rules , so if he was n't seeing a company doctor , no . 
  hence , the company is not at fault here . 
  they have to change the law to make an exception for pilots . 
   i know , so why do n't you try [ 1 ] being a smart boy . 
   a hint [ 2 ] , and good luck .
