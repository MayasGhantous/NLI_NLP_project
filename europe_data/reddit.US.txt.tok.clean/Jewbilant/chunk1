to be honest , i do n't really get what 's newsworthy abut this . 
  this would n't even be a big deal if an israeli politician said it . 
  no country in the world opposes the theoretical existence of a palestinian state . 
  my suggestion : [ anglosphere unification ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d4ruxmy.png ), 
  not necessarily . 
  it wo n't be multipolar , but it may be bipolar . 
  depends how u.s.-china relations progress . 
  i 'm skeptical that china will be able to challenge u.s. supremacy across the world , but they will be up to the challenge in the western pacific . 
  the united states managed to become the most powerful country in the world without fighting it 's predecessor ( britain i suppose , though they were never had as much relative power as the u.s. & it 's unclear when the u.s. passed britain ) . 
  the primary benefit is that when one state is significantly more powerful than any other state , interstate conflict becomes less likely . 
  the united states has been the dominant power in western europe & east asia for 70 years . 
  had the united states not been dominant , there likely would have been significant resistance to japan 's post wwii rise . 
  same for germany ( especially reunification ) . 
  what would the global economy look like if iran & saudi arabia had to go twelve rounds every few years because of regional tensions . 
  multipolarity is a recipe for disaster . 
  a colony ruled by the british . 
  at the time , palestine would n't have really referred to the local arab population , jews used the term too . 
  not that president obama deserved the award , but being willing to go to war is incredibly important in certain circumstances . 
  the world leaders who have done the most to improve the world have been those who were willing to go to war ( lincoln , churchill , fdr ) . 
  when he was bombing al-qaeda & the taliban ? 
  compared to what ? 
  pretty much every `` who did you vote for '' thread is dominated by people voting for the center-left party or a party to the left of that . 
  france is generally considered a major intelligence threat to the united states . 
  among u.s. allies , the reports usually name france , south korea , & israel . 
  billionaires have relatively little to do with it , though the relative success of the 1 % ( where the income threshold about $ 400k ) does . 
  the american middle class is richer than the european middle class . 
  it 's only at the lower percentiles of income that european countries pass the united states , largely because of generous welfare programs . 
  first past the post puts less pressure on political parties to select women than party list systems . 
  this is especially true in america because the national party does n't have as much influence in choosing who runs where . 
  i think a lot of people do n't realize how much stronger the american economy than most other major economies . 
  according to the imf , there are 9 countries with higher gdp ( ppp ) per capitas than the united states , all with less than 10 million people , most of which are big oil exporters . 
  i think that the american economic system , while not exactly popular on reddit or / r/europe , leads to people working harder & innovating more . 
  also , the world-class education system and nature of u.s. immigration policy means that more foreigners innovate here than in other first world countries . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21569024-troubling-similarities-between-fiscal-mismanagement-washington-and-mess ) is the accompanying article . 
  to summarize 1 : throughout the crisis , european leaders resorted to a bunch of quick fixes on the currency crisis . 
  american politicians did the same thing on america 's fiscal issues . 
  2 : europeans were unable to rise above `` petty national concerns '' to make big compromises , just as american politicians are unable to rise above party politics & interest groups . 
  3 : politicians have failed to be honest with voters . 
  hollande & merkel have not explained what is necessary to save the currency , just as obama & boehner have refused to explain what must be done to solve the fiscal mess . 
  some interesting excerpts :  in interviews with foreign policy , her european colleagues have described her as `` brash , '' `` direct , '' `` forceful , '' `` blunt , '' `` crude , '' and occasionally , `` undiplomatic . '' but they also stressed that genuine policy differences account for their frustrations with her -- in particular , her support for sending arms to ukraine as the country fends off a russian-backed rebellion , a policy not supported by the white house . 
   her popularity in washington stems in part from the aggressive rhetoric she employs to castigate the russians and push the europeans to take a harder line . 
   in march , she accused moscow of conducting a `` reign of terror '' in crimea and eastern ukraine . 
  days earlier , she became the first u.s. official to publicly use the term `` invasion '' to describe the kremlin 's transgressions in the country . 
  she has repeatedly blasted `` russia and its separatist puppets '' for committing `` unspeakable violence and pillage '' and has vowed to make russian president vladimir putin pay for any further escalation . 
  during congressional testimony , she has compared the process of negotiating with the europeans to herding `` cats . '' and last year , a leaked audio recording famously caught her saying `` fuck the eu '' during a phone call with the u.s. ambassador to ukraine . 
   `` many europeans , and certainly moscow , hate nuland , which is just one more reason why her political base on capitol hill adores her , '' said a congressional aide familiar with the issue . 
  personally , i think that while she may be undiplomatic , she 's ultimately right on the need to call a spade a spade and take a harsher line against russia . 
  the west 's response to putin 's aggression has been middling at best and at the end of the day , only gives him the green light to continue as far as he wishes . 
  it 's ridiculous that some in europe wish to appease putin or participate in diplomatic negotiations that putin will simply ignore . 
  the countries closest to russia - poland , estonia , latvia , & lithuania , are correct in their assessment of the situation and should not be abandoned .

  the united states has no defense obligation to georgia , moldova , & kazakhstan . 
  also , the vice headline is kind of misleading . 
  the ambassador called the number of u.s. troops stationed in the baltics a `` joke '' , not america 's commitment to the defense of the baltic states . 
  former french president nicolas sarkozy spoke yesterday at the herzliya conference in israel . 
  the herzliya conference is a major conference in israel featuring a variety of policy makers . 
  other speakers this year include israeli president reuven rivlin , former israeli prime minister ehud barak , czech foreign minister lubomir zaoralek , former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , israeli defense minister moshe ya'alon , israeli opposition leader isaac herzog , and many others . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prsoojxj1ec ) is a video of sarkozy 's speech . 
  i have n't been able to find an english transcript , but [ ben judah ] ( https://twitter.com/b_judah ) , a british journalist , provided some quotes . 
  sarkozy got a very warm reception . 
  he came out fairly strongly against western policy in the middle east and criticized the approach toward iran & syria . 
  panel 5 . 
  it 's not exactly the same question , but when gallup asked americans their opinion of france in 2013 , 82 % of democrats and 64 % of republicans had a favorable opinion . 
  overall , france had a 73 % favorability in 2013 . 
  it was at 82 % in 2015 , but i do n't see ratings by party . 
  so if each party increased equally , it would by 91 % for dems and 73 % for republicans . 
  interestingly enough , it was the only liberal democratic ally for which democrats had a more favorable opinion than republicans . 
  canada , britain , japan , germany , & israel all had higher favorability with republicans than democrats . 
  it might simply be a consequence of the fact that young people tend to be less informed and knowledgeable about politics & news than older people ( which may not be the most popular statement on reddit ) . 
  it could easily reflect a lack of knowledge about the relationship rather than a negative opinion of germany . 
  it might simply be a consequence of the fact that young people tend to be less informed and knowledgeable about politics & news than older people ( which may not be the most popular statement on reddit ) . 
  it could easily reflect a lack of knowledge about the relationship rather than a negative opinion of germany . 
  i suppose it depends on how you interpret the question . 
  one can interpret it as either `` which event impacts the relationship the most '' or `` which event is the most important '' . 
  the answer for each question would be different for many people . 
  some observations : * the split on policy toward russia is very important . 
  it may also be surprising to some how much of a consensus there is in america on russia policy . 
  only 4 % think we 've been too tough . 
  * i was actually a bit surprised that the marshall plan was viewed so importantly by germans . 
  similarly , i 'm surprised that relatively few people saw world war ii & the holocaust as the most important . 
  * the fact that spd voters see the u.s. as a more reliable ally than cdu supporters really shocked me . 
  * the divide on britain is pretty surprising . 
  why are germans lukewarm on the u.k. ? 
  * the difference when it comes to obama & merkel within their countries is interesting . 
  i think it 's just a result of president obama 's foreign policy being very unpopular . 
  when pew polled president obama 's foreign policy , only 36 % thought it was `` about right '' . 
  54 % saw it as not tough enough and only 3 % saw it as too tough . 
  fox asked a similar question around the same time without including an `` about right '' choice ( but still recording those who said `` about right '' . 
  6 % saw him as too tough , 74 % saw him as not tough enough . 
  the 16 % refers to the proportion of the jao that was jewish , not the share of soviet jews who lived there . 
  18,000 jews would be about 0.5 % of soviet jews in 1939 . 
  but then why did snp succeed with miliband leading labour , instead of the much more moderate blair ? 
  it 's why they won three elections between 1997 and 2005 , including two by historic majorities . 
  i said absolutely nothing about president obama in a domestic context , which seems to be more relevant to most of your spiel . 
  not to mention that what you 've said basically echoes my statement that there 's a lot of congressional opposition to his foreign policy . 
  world war ii is among the greatest triumphs of freedom liberty in human history , along with the fall of the soviet union . 
  also , it 's in pretty bad taste to compare nazism ( the oppression he references ) with a constitutional argument over legislative prayer or nsa surveillance . 
  * iran-style sanctions on russia would be pretty effective in the capital markets sphere , but without backing from europe , it would n't make a difference with regards to exports . 
  * he did n't propose immediate membership for ukraine , but indicated that he would n't take it off the table in the future .
