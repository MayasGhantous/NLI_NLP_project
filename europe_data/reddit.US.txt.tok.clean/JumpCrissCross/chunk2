  when ted cruz 's u.s. government shutdown , treasury yields fell . 
  this is why bund yields are falling . 
  the ecb , with the esm and efsf , are credible in their capacity to couple eurozone rates . 
  grexit has been priced into the euro , eurozone rates , national bourses and the implied volatility on options thereon . 
  ( greek options have traded more like the balkans than the eurozone for more than a month now . ), 
  there will be idiot traders still surprised . 
  but at worst , private participation in peripheral interbank lending will subside for a while . 
  if anything , grexit produces a coherent eurozone , institutionally and economically . 
  that * decreases * uncertainty . 
  ** edit ** : i was an impolite bayesian . 
  you hold the view , with conviction , that grexit will cause a eurozone crisis of confidence and meltdown . 
  this is a minority view in the financial markets . 
  but if you 're right , options across the continent are mis-priced . 
  would be willing to buy , with 10x leverage , a basket of eurozone options ? 
  if not , or not with significant leverage , consider that the unknowability of the outcome is a two-tailed distribution . 
   so this whole `` more money '' thing does n't makes sens [ * sic * ] to me they * were * running a primary surplus . 
  tax receipts have been decimated . 
  athens will need financing while tax collection ramps up . 
  also , the banking system is closer to insolvency if not already insolvent . 
  business destruction in cyprus after capital controls was tremendous . 
  that was with a relatively healthy economy going in . 
  a bank recapitalisation may be necessary at this point . 
  but in broad strokes , you 're right . 
  greece only pays about 2.2 % of its gdp away in interest [ 1 ] . 
  that is less than portugal , italy , ireland , belgium or france . 
  the issue is growth , for which austerity is the wrong answer . 
  the right answer is structural reform . 
  greece had been doing well at that , rising from 108th place in the world bank 's ease of doing business ranking in 2008 to 62nd in 2015 [ 2 ] . 
  but progress on that path is questionable , given the syriza government 's apparently total inability to form and execute even medium-term plans .

   the eu will be a better working organisation when greece leaves only if it seizes the opportunity . 
  on sunday the ft reported that `` folllowing a banking union , '' sch\u00e4uble `` wants joint institutions , including a permanent administration and a eurozone parliament '' [ 1 ] . 
  these are steps towards fiscal integration . 
  if grexit allows for a closer union , i think it will have been worth it . 
  ( greece 's public institutions are not ready for such an integration . ), 
  otherwise , it will simply serve to demonstrate the eurozone 's structural problems . 
   what is a bail in for non native speakers ? 
  imagine a simple bank . 
  it has $ 100 in deposits . 
  with these deposits , it makes $ 90 of loans . 
  suppose half these loans are to people and the other half are to the government . 
  but , crisis !, 
  everyone wants their money . 
  the bank only has $ 10 in cash . 
  it has another $ 90 in assets , but people do n't like getting mortgages in lieu of cash at the atm . 
  the bank is in a ** liquidity crisis ** . 
  to solve these , we invented modern central banks . 
  the central bank , or `` lender of last resort , '' can make new money . 
  it lends that money to our bank . 
  but it does n't want to lose money . 
  so it takes our bank 's assets , or `` collateral , '' in return . 
  remember , our bank made the loan . 
  not the central bank . 
  the central bank does n't know if it 's buying dud loans from our bank . 
  to protect itself , it pays $ 0.90 on each euro of assets . 
  this is a 10 % ** haircut ** . 
  our bank gives the central bank $ 33.33 in assets and gets $ 30 of loans . 
  woot !, 
  but , crisis !, 
  government says `` fuck you '' to its creditors . 
  central bank looks at the government loans our bank gave it and thinks `` these might not be worth $ 100 any more ; they may not even be worth $ 90 . 
  i could lose money ! '', 
  so the central bank tells our bank it is ** raising its haircut ** . 
  it will now only pay $ 0.75 on each euro of assets ( a 25 % haircut ) . 
  our bank already borrowed $ 30 from the central bank . 
  but it tendered just $ 33.33 in assets . 
  it must now give the central bank another $ 6.67 to bring its collateral on deposit at the central bank to $ 40 . 
  this is why when a haircut is raised banks must produce more collateral . 
  what if our bank has no more collateral the central bank will accept ? 
  then it is ** insolvent ** . 
  it defaults on its loan to the central bank . 
  this means no new cash . 
  it also means the bank owes the central bank $ 6.67 . 
  first , our bank will try to sell its assets . 
  this probably wo n't work ( if it did , our bank would n't have gone insolvent in the first place ) . 
  this leaves deposits . 
  so we take the $ 6.67 out of our $ 100 of deposits . 
  this is called a ** bail-in ** . 
  everyone 's bank account will be reduced by 6.67 % the next day ( presuming we decide to distribute the pain equally ) . 
  no more `` impertinent questions '' . 
   wish he could be head of finances of my country . 
  i would truly be proud to be an american a large part of our success comes from keeping people like him ( firebrand ideologues appealing to base instincts ) either out of or marginalised in government . 
   the europeans were ... saying that he was ** the ** impediment varoufakis colourfully personified syriza 's na\u00efvety and arrogance . 
  that said , europe has always held the syriza government , and not just varoufakis , responsible . 
  the troika continuing to distrust the tsipras government will be consistent with their messaging . 
   we have the capacity to print $ 20 notes according to the ecb , greece has n't had the authority to print $ 20 notes since 2013 [ 1 ] . 
  ( currently , it may only print $ 10 notes . ),
