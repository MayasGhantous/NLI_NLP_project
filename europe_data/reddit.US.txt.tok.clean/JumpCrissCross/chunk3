  * after accounting for leverage ( from both borrowing and derivatives ) . 
  greece defaulting would have been embarrassing for germany in the way puerto rico defaulting will be embarrassing for american asset managers . 
  germany could handle greece defaulting in 2012 . 
  what it and europe could * not * handle was italy tanking . 
  due to ring-fencing issues at the time , greece 's collapse could have caused that . 
  the proximate motivation is thus political , in a uniquely european way , more than financial . 
  ( unless one believes eurozone politicians only care about the euro for their own banks ' sake , a view which creates more absurdities than it resolves . ), 
  side note : `` derivatives bubble '' makes no sense . 
  derivatives are n't priced to each other but to assets and rates . 
  you can have an asset or rates bubble amplified by a certain set of derivatives . 
  but a stock option is unlikely to have any effect on my renter 's insurance . 
  i 'm not promoting or rejecting the report 's accuracy in this thread . 
  ( though it should be noted that this is a recent , backward-looking report . ), 
  i 'm attacking the cherry-picking of its findings . 
  it 's intellectually dishonest to cite the report as vindication of syriza 's debt reduction platform while dismissing its position on syriza 's role in precipitating the crisis . 
  not saying it 's an invalid position . 
  but it ca n't use this report as evidence for its claims . 
   it literally could n't be syriza 's doing . 
  according to the imf , had the november 2012 framework 's trajectory been maintained the debt would have been sustainable . 
  samara 's government caused a divergence . 
  nobody holds them faultless . 
  but the confident rendering of syriza blameless over the ensuing 7 months is not supported by the data in the report . 
  i 've commented on this elsewhere in this thread [ 1 ] . 
  yes , the report tacitly blames syriza for rendering greece 's debt burden unsustainable . 
  but it also vindicates their position that greece requires debt write-downs . 
  the barn is burning . 
  water needs to be thrown on it . 
  syriza is saying this . 
  the imf agrees . 
  the imf concedes that since before syriza 's time the barn was old , dry and neglected to the degree that it was less a barn than an elaborate pile of kindling . 
  but it also says syriza caused the barn to light on fire . 
  before anyone wastes their water , they want assurances that the barn wo n't promptly re-ignite , the same way it did the first time , upon completion of their efforts . 
  the people in the barn are not thrilled with this conditionality .

  on the first page :  by late summer 2014 , with interest rates having declined further , it appeared that no further debt relief would have been needed under the november 2012 framework , if the program were to have been implemented as agreed . 
  but significant changes in policies since then -- not least , lower primary surpluses and a weak reform effort that will weigh on growth and privatization -- are leading to substantial new financing needs . 
  coming on top of the very high existing debt , these new financing needs render the debt dynamics unsustainable . 
  http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr15165.pdf so , yes , the imf says the debt becoming unsustainable was likely a result of syriza 's policies . 
  it acknowledges , however , that the situation was precarious previously . 
  either way , to make greece viable some of the debt needs to go . 
  the problem is the same guys who made the last debt burden unsustainable are in office today . 
  what stops them from tipping over the cart and requesting additional reductions in the future ? 
  this is one of the nexuses of distrust propelling this crisis forward . 
   the polls are media made and are fake when you said `` fake '' , a comment above [ 1 ] , did you mean `` falsified '' or `` unreliable '' ? 
  polls in the u.k. and u.s. have been wildly off-base without any propaganda motive . 
  instead , sampling or statistical errors were made . 
  either way , the wikipedia article you point to [ 2 ] shows accurate polls within a reasonable margin of error . 
  in mid-2012 they showed syriza and new democracy winning 25 to 30 % each . 
  starting from the summer of 2014 , syriza breaks ahead to right around where the election landed .

   really , the only thing that always deters tourists longterm is violence . 
  from the article :  [ andreas andreadis , the head of the association of hellenic tourism enterprises ( sete ) ] went on to warn that food and drink stocks will only suffice to cover hotels ' needs for one more week . 
  greek tourism depends on cross-border supply , in addition to financial , chains . 
  severing them suddenly will dramatically reduce the number of tourists greece can service properly and profitably . 
  there are many countries and cities on coasts and islands with low levels of violent crime . 
  yet tourists do n't flock to all of them . 
  where proximity is n't the answer , lack of a functioning service infrastructure usually is . 
  source ( s ) ? 
  thank you . 
  as the ceps report linked to states , `` adjusting the fiscal balance for the effects of the cycle is more of an art form than a science '' . 
  let 's look at table 1 , at the top of page 2 in the ceps report [ 1 ] . 
  this is the first mention of the `` 6.7 '' figure . 
  the source claimed is the winter economic forecast published by the european commission in january 2015 [ 2 ] . 
  i searched the document for `` 6.7 '' and got zero hits . 
  i also searched the full , europe-wide report [ 3 ] . 
  nothing pertaining to greece came up . 
  on the bottom of page 76 of the full report [ 3 ] ( second page in [ 2 ] ) , we find greece 's cyclically-adjusted budget balances for 2014 , 2015 and 2016 at 2.5 % , 4.1 % and 2.1 % of gdp , respectively . 
  in the footnote at the bottom of page 2 of the ceps report , greece 's debt-service burden was quoted -- without a source -- at 2.5 % of gdp . 
  add that to the 4.1 % cyclically-adjusted budget balance for 2015 and we get 6.6 % + / - rounding errors . 
  ( to have fallen to 4.2 % in 2016 , still a respectable figure . ), 
  the ceps report linked to claims `` the commission compares actual gdp to its own estimate of potential gdp '' to cyclically adjust its numbers . 
  so to trust the cyclically-adjusted number , we need to trust how the ec allocated items between `` cyclical '' and `` structural '' ( this is where the `` artistic '' element comes in ) . 
  greece was meeting a high bar for austerity through january 2015 . 
  this is consistent with the imf 's claims . 
  since january , however , the country has reversed course . 
  some of this is sensible . 
  a good amount , however , was populist . 
  the types of reforms greece needs are n't of the mathematically-clean budget-slashing type . 
  it 's in reforming labour laws , licensing requirements , the ease of starting companies and doing business , property rights , contract enforcement , and tax collection , * et cetera * . 
  a sensible path forward would be promising pre-negotiated official debt reduction in exchange for implementing , to the satisfaction of an independent third party , these structural reforms . 
  to cap moral hazard , the same opportunity could be made available -- with retroactive applicability to official loans -- to other efsf , esm , etc.

   in may , vadim pokrovsky , the head of russia 's state-run aids organization , told afp that the country 's hiv epidemic has worsened dramatically in recent years , warning that at least 2 million people will be infected with the virus within the next five years . 
  pokrovsky added that there are now around 930,000 russians infected with hiv , using official 2015 estimates of russia 's population [ 1 ] , this implies 0.6 % of russians are infected with hiv . 
  a further 1.4 % are expected to get infected over the next 5 years . 
  if these estimates are to be trusted , by 2020 a full 2 % of the russian population will be infected with hiv .

   it 's $ 50bn ~ $ 36bn the imf quotes its shortfall estimate in euros , not dollars . 
   financing needs add up to over $ 50 billion over the three-year period from october 2015 to end -- 2018 http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr15165.pdf * bottom of page 9 *, 
   everyone including tsipras and varoufakis knew this in 2009 except the imf considered the debts payable as recently as `` late summer 2014 '' . 
  it was only after `` significant changes in policies since then -- not least , lower primary surpluses and a weak reform effort that will weigh on growth and privatization '' that the burden became unsustainable . 
   why not admit that the debt is actually unpayable , just like the imf did in this report the imf considered the debts payable as recently as `` late summer 2014 '' . 
  it was only after `` significant changes in policies since then -- not least , lower primary surpluses and a weak reform effort that will weigh on growth and privatization '' that the burden became unsustainable . 
   the imf today let the world to know that all plans that do n't include a debt cut ( as the one we are voting on and does not exist anymore ) are not going to work . 
  greece 's debt was sustainable as recently as `` late summer 2014 '' . 
  only after `` significant changes in policies since then -- not least , lower primary surpluses and a weak reform effort that will weigh on growth and privatization '' did the burden , once again , according to the imf , become unsustainable :  by late summer 2014 , with interest rates having declined further , it appeared that no further debt relief would have been needed under the november 2012 framework , if the program were to have been implemented as agreed . 
  but significant changes in policies since then -- not least , lower primary surpluses and a weak reform effort that will weigh on growth and privatization -- are leading to substantial new financing needs .
