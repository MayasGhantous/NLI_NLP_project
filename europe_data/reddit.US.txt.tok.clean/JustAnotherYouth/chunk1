i mean yeah , that 's reasonable . 
  europe has by far the most wimpy weather of all the continents . 
  we do n't mix them up , pretending we think you 're all mexicans is super fun , you get so annoyed about it . 
  i 've rarely met a spaniard without a poorly concealed sense of superiority over mexicans . 
  i 'd have asked `` so good at killing russians '' but you 're also smart . 
  what 's your secret for producing mud ? 
  because imperialism , durrr . 
  with europe not being conquered in its entirety , and in perpetuity , by nazi germany ? 
  though i guess if no one but germany had prepared the war would have been shorter at least . 
  if you think that would have been a preferable outcome ? 
  this is correct , but for the sake of clarity it 's worth pointing out how this works in practical terms . 
  for example one very critical element when talking about sub v. surface combatant is speed . 
  surface ships , and u.s. carriers in particular are fast , really really fast . 
  diesel electric / fuel cell powered subs are by contrast pretty slow . 
  this means that if a submarine wants to sink a carrier it first needs to find it ( not very easy ) , then it needs to put itself in the right place ( very difficult to intercept an actively maneuvering vehicle that is much faster than you ) . 
  even in a simple red vs. blue scenario the game parameters usually prescribe boundaries , and restrictions . 
  if you 're running a war game you want to actually have a practice engagement , you do n't want to waste a shit ton of money sailing around and ** not ** engaging the `` enemy '' . 
  that is after all the majority of navy life , and the reason to run a game is for the sake of practice . 
  in other words war games , encourage engagement . 
  but in real life conflicts your primary goal is often to avoid being engaged directly . 
  and in this real life scenario it is actually very difficult for any submarine , and particularly an electric submarine , to interdict a surface fleet , unless you know where that fleet is and you more or less know where it 's going . 
  it turns out that international politics and business is a little bit more complicated than `` made in britain , just vote leave '' , or `` build a wall '' ? 
  turns out there 's all these complicated international ownership structures , and trade agreements , and long term contracts . 
  turns out that the international company that sells you chips ( sorry , crisps , weirdos ) does n't give a fuck about your english pride ? 
  nope they 're concerned with their ** international ** bottom line and they do n't give a shit about your self obsessed bullshit . 
  that 's right guys down vote this fucker with his facts and figures , what does he know , rah rah european nationalism . 
   il start being worried when space x actually carry a single payload safely , so far it has n't worked all that great ... 
  the falcon 9 still has a better record than the ariane 5 at comparable stages of development . 
  and the f9 is pushing the boundaries off rocket science far more aggressively than the ariane 5 or six ever will . 
  two complete failures does not a failed launch system make . 
  space x on the other hand has an extremely minimalist supply chain and they try to do as much as possible in house . 
  and their launchers are much , much , ** much ** , cheaper than the ariane family . 
  colbert 's character was * supposed * to be more than a republican , he was supposed to be the ultimate republican , in other words satirical . 
  unfortunately actual republicans apparently took the mockery as a challenge and upped their game . 
  this happens pretty much every election honestly . 
  also republicans playing songs by artists who publicly denounce them is more or less par for the course . 
  public school in virginia , 9th grade english class ( not an elective ) . 
   what happened to the e pluribus unum ? 
  i really do n't see how our national motto relates to the issue . 
   you guys have a weird definition of separation of state and religion . 
  the bible is an incredibly important and influential piece of ** literature ** if you do n't know a thing or five about the bible a lot of books are going to contain big confusing bits . 
  i guess i should sue my high school for forcing me to read `` the bible as literature '' and while i 'm at it that comprehensive review of greek literature and mythology . 
  also the odyssey because jesus fucking christ , fuck reading the odyssey . 
  as an american who interacts with a lot of europeans , and is married to one . 
  a major communication issue i 've noticed is that american english in particular is heavily referenced based . 
  i know american music / tv shows / movies / sports / celebrities are ubiquitous but even still there 's a whole lot of `` culture '' that is very popular here but does n't gain much notoriety world wide . 
  even americans are n't plugged into all of this stuff because there 's just so much of it . 
  but we often talk as if the cultural references we 're making are obviously understood by everyone around us . 
  and then the cultural references become idioms , and while regular english is already very idiomatic american english is even more idiomatic . 
  ** tldr : ** a lot of people have trouble with english particularly american english because the usage of cultural references and idioms is so over the top . 
  yeah , i was thinking it makes much more sense to have some sort of central water tower . 
  or even better two actual lakes ( man made or natural ) with a significant altitude difference between the two . 
  then run pumps powered by a set of windmills to move the water to a higher potential energy position . 
  but i do n't see any reason you need to make the windmills themselves the primary power storage locations . 
  here 's a basic list from best to worst . 
  1 ) family owned business 2 ) small business 3 ) business 4 ) company 5 ) corporation 6 ) multinational corporation, 
   evil with their companies and stuff . 
  ** corporations ** companies does n't sound sinister enough . 
  so what you 're saying is that curiosity is * basically * a european rover ? 
  [ jamie oliver is crying again ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfzaru9zmas ), 
  the brazilians have them too ( french retirees ) but i 'm somewhat skeptical of their ability to actually operate the things in a meaningful manner . 
  that 's the enterprise , not a nimitz , you can tell by the two prongs on the front of the ship . 
  ehhh but arguably the charles de gaulle is better of both ( or all five ) combined . 
  it 's status as the only catobar carrier in europe is the huge factor . 
  catobar enables vastly increased sortie generation rate , the ability to launch heavier ( and more heavily loaded ) , higher performance , and longer range aircraft . 
  i think it was a very poor choice by the royal navy to cut the catobar systems from the queen elizabeth class .

  `` we do n't even care about america , we just talk about them all the time so they know how much we do n't care '' . 
   they are called gutter punks and are some of the most entitled shits you will ever meet . 
  also called : crusties , or crust punks , there are a surprising number of trustifarians among their ranks . 
  within my demographic the iphone is seriously dominant . 
  i would say something like between 70 and 80 percent of the people i regularly interact with use iphones . 
  alternate messaging apps like whatsapp are n't nearly as popular in the u.s. as they are in the rest of the world . 
  you can , but you run into a lot of problems with group texts , sending pictures / videos , other weirdness . 
  yeah , if apple does n't get their shit together before my phone breaks i think that 's where i 'm going . 
  imessage , if imessage played nice with all of the other messaging apps in the world i would drop apple in a heartbeat . 
  i 've only had one iphone and i 've never bought into the `` apple everything '' ecosystem . 
  i 'm absolutely willing to leave apple behind if they start leaving out essential features . 
  if you do n't want to go past the basic capabilities of your phone ( out of the box ) i think you can argue that apple is the better choice . 
  the fact that every manufacturer is using its own modified version of android , which may or may not have its own issues . 
  the fact that other manufactures tend to have a more aggressive release / revision rate as well as selling half a dozen ( or more ) models of their own phones . 
  some of which are budget , some of which are performance models , etc. 
  then on top of that you just have to deal with the fact that the relatively low numbers of phones ( of any particular model ) sold by a manufacture , tends to mean less support / testing / community understanding . 
  in other words the android world is filled with a lot more potential failure points on both the hardware and software side of things . 
  for example when my 2 year old htc one x had a broken digitizer i could n't find anyone who carried the part for a reasonable price . 
  that would n't have been a problem with iphones simply because there are a shit ton of every , single , version , of the iphone . 
  this also tends to mean that if an app is n't working on iphones ( of basically any model ) the developer is sure is shit going to fix it , and fast . 
  if an app is for some reason not working well on whatever android phone you 've got , there 's a good chance that ( if that phone is n't wildly popular ) figuring out what is wrong is going to be a much lower priority for the developers . 
  oh an then there 's the fact that imessage does n't play nice with other messaging apps . 
  which is apple 's own fault , but that does n't make it any less annoying when you ca n't receive images , or group text does n't work , because everyone else in your life has an iphone . 
  apple 's slogan `` it just works '' is actually pretty accurate , so long as you do n't intend to use your phone in any way apple did n't originally envision . 
   which is heavier : a kilogram of feathers , or a kilogram of lead ? 
  trick question , in matters of what is heavier the answer is ** always ** your mom . 
  do n't worry , i wont . 
  but i actually prefer the iphone to android phones i 've had ( boo , hisss , gasp ) . 
  so i 'm fervently hoping that the iphone 7 takes a severe enough sales hit / generates enough ill will , etc , for apple to actually change its policy . 
  unlikely but a boy can dream . 
  if they do n't , whenever my current phone dies i 'm going to have to either get an iphone 6s plus , or i 'm going to have to go back to android . 
  ahh simple mistake , you first need to transfer me $ 500.00 ( it 's a good deal because euros are worth more ) to my email at thistotallyisntascamyouidiot@gmail.com . 
  then the email will work .
