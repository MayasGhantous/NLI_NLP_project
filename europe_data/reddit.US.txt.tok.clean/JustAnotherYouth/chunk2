  fuck you apple , i want my god damned 3.5 mm headphone jack . 
  you can tell it is n't obsolete because the ** vast majority ** of iphone users use it ** every single fucking day ** .

  airbnb host here , you can ask your perspective host . 
  very few people are going to post that information publicly , or give you their exact address before you make a reservation with them . 
  if people ask me the exact address i tell them `` no , but here 's the nearest intersection , we 're 30 seconds from that location '' . 
  this combined with strict cancellation policy means that no-one is going to learn the exact address of my residence without paying at least a couple hundred bucks . 
  which is a good way to keep the government , and the general public suitably un-aware of the information they need to hassle you . 
  maybe the confusion is because certain european governments have recently banned wearing too many clothes in some situations . 
  perhaps some people now feel that society has sanctioned their hatred for people who are n't willing to conform enough to their societal standards ? 
  yes , the only an-225 is operated by antonov airlines as a specialized cargo transporter . 
  there was some talk a while back about them completing the second 225 but i 'm not even certain that project has gone ahead . 
  all in all mass producing 225 's does n't strike me as a particularly good idea . 
  aside from its massive size which allows it to access a small market of super specialized cargo transport it is n't a particularly good cargo aircraft . 
  most significantly it is n't a particularly efficient aircraft . 
  the 225 was a one off ( 2-off ) modification of the 124 for carrying the buran orbiter . 
  using a purpose built speciality aircraft as some sort of generalist super heavy cargo plane seems , odd . 
   kerolox rockets have been optimized to the point that they 're pretty damn close to that limit . 
  it does n't matter how you ignite it , it 's not going to get any better . 
  not even a little true . 
  most rp-1 burning engines are run fuel rich , there is literally not enough oxygen in the mixture to 100 % com-bust the rp-1 . 
  this is done for a number of reasons , heat management , lubrication , maintaining the right environment in the chambers . 
  example , in a fuel rich cycle you 're typically dealing with a reducing environment . 
  in an oxygen rich cycle you 're dealing with an oxidizing environment which likes to eat through engine chambers . 
  of course there are ways around this problem , having an oxidation barrier ( typically a fluid layer of rp-1 , but other fluids would work as well ) . 
  in short there are lots and lots of reasons why we are no where near 100 % optimization with kerolox rockets . 
  different materials , different engine designs , a greater understanding of fluid dynamics as well as increased modeling capabilities etc. 
  basically even the concept of `` optimized '' does n't make sense in this context . 
  optimized for what , at what altitude , with what performance ? 
  likely eminent domain . 
  basically the government has the right to buy property from citizens at market value , if it requires that land for public projects which are in the interests of `` the public '' . 
  this law can also ** sometimes ** be extended to companies / corporations / etc. 
  if you 're granted this right you are given the right to buy out other property holders ** even if ** they do n't want to sell . 
  before you get to outraged by this , it should be noted that in cases of corporately granted eminent domain the initial property owners are almost always compensated at a rate significantly greater than market dictated property values ( being paid 10x 's the market value of property is not unheard of ) . 
  this is simply because companies often value their time far more than the relatively small sums they 'll pay to acquire the necessary land . 
  it 's more effective to pay off property holders big time than to have a long court fight over fair valuation in court . 
  it 's still a pretty big deal for a corporation to be granted eminent domain rights , it happens but it is n't the norm . 
  you 'll hear ( true ) stories about developers building around a tiny property owner they are unable to buy out , this would n't happen if your average developer could gain access to eminent domain , but they mostly can not . 
  dude i 'm done with you , you 're being deliberately obtuse to further your own argument . 
  it 's obvious and it 's boring . 
  no , i specifically said that the arms length principle ** as being applied ** by the european commission is not a known principle and has n't been applied before . 
  point 1 . 
   you should be ashmed of yourself for lying . 
  point 2  to summarise the main points , the 2010 oecd guidelines : \u2022 reaffirm the position of oecd member states that the arm 's - length principle is the fairest and most reliable basis for determining where profits fall to be taxed and reject alternatives such as global formulary apportionment ( chapter i ) . 
  the european commission has conceded that apple was in adherence to oecd guidelines . 
  so if that was the basis for the european commissions `` arm 's length '' standard they 're conceding apple is in compliance . 
  the european commission has already stated that ** their ** `` arm 's length policy '' is not derived from oecd transfer pricing guidelines . 
   if apple us charged apple ireland prices that bear no relation to what the eu commission deems market value , then that can be argued as being tax fraud rather than tax avoidance . 
  the eu commission has conceded that apple adhered to oecd guidelines on the matter . 
  as that is in essence the adhered to standards of the eu : [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oecd_guidelines_for_multinational_enterprises ) what is the further cause for grievance ? 
   on the plus side , you have at least now read part of the article . 
  fun insult time , it 's a real wonder that people think of europeans as arrogant . 
   the investigation is into activities such as transfer pricing which allows companies like apple europe to essentially pay no corporate tax as they make no profit in that specific corporate entity . 
  oh cool attempting to broad brush the entire realm of transfer pricing as being solely implemented for tax avoidance . 
  good start with the impartiality here . 
   apple 's defense is that any other company could potentially use this means of tax avoidance . 
  except not really , apple 's defense is that the standard they are being held to regarding the determination of tax burden , the so called `` arm 's length principle '' . 
  is n't actually a standard and has n't ** actually ** ever been applied in a case like this . 
   1 ) the collusion between the tax authorities and apple see the before mentioned `` arms length principle '' which is n't actually a principle and has never been applied in the context of tax calculations / state aid / transfer pricing . 
   2 ) that the transfer pricing charges do not represent actual market value ( e.g. 
  if apple usa charges apple ireland $ 1.2 bn per year for trademark and ip rights , the commission may argue that the actual value of those only amount to $ 100mn and that the $ 1.1 bn is illegal and potentially fraudulent ) the most common transfer pricing guidelines are those published by the oecd . 
  the european commission has ** conceded ** that the deals in question are ** consistent with oecd guidelines ** . 
  the extra criteria the european commission is implementing come from ** literally nowhere ** . 
  this is a ** political play ** by the eu as a mechanism to counter the current nationalist / anti-globalist forces in eu politics . 
  the eu has picked primarily american companies to investigate . 
  so they can define themselves as the tough guys , defending europeans from globalist exploitation . 
  the legal basis for doing this is much less important than the optics of doing so . 
   the eu has been investigating whether apple 's tax deals with ireland , which allowed the company to pay very little tax on income earned throughout europe , amounted to state aid . 
  the commission is expected next month to rule on the case , the biggest single corporate tax avoidance investigation . 
   investment bank jp morgan has warned that if the commission requires apple to ** retroactively ** pay the irish corporate ** tax rate ** of 12.5 % on the pre-tax profits it collected via ireland it could cost the company as much as $ 19bn . 
  i believe the word you 're looking for is bullshit . 
  what a nonsensical line or reasoning , apple has every right to enter into legal contracts that benefit them financially . 
  and so does ireland , what is n't acceptable is claiming ( decades after the fact ) that the deal is n't fair and you 're actually owed the difference . 
  cool , lets write those laws . 
  instead what european countries have been doing is writing into law specialized tax rates to attract large corporations tax income from ** other countries ** . 
  then after years of using this tactic to generate domestic income the ec wants to retroactively instate taxes because they feel they 're owed more . 
  and suddenly the only bad guys are the big bad corporations that were n't paying enough ? 
  maybe if you want to take the moral high ground you should write fair laws with fair rates from the start . 
  if that means you do n't get to poach international corporations i suppose that 's too bad . 
  but do n't write laws and then complain about those laws 10 years later when you decide you want a better deal . 
  cute suck up and all but on what legal basis is the european commission basing its claim ? 
  on the fact that apple and other multinationals incorporated in countries which ** legally ** offered them a particular tax rate . 
  i 'm all for tightening tax law , and cracking down on tax fraud . 
  but it 's a dangerous precedent for random semi-governmental organizations to arbitrarily demand taxes that they ** feel ** they are owed . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  monasticism is an element of religion , if the problem is `` secularism '' as the french are attempting to argue , monastic status should also be shielded from the public eye . 
  what you really mean is monasticism is part of catholicism , the unofficial ** french religion ** and so it is tolerated regardless of `` secularism '' but islam is not . 
  right and if some nuns went for a walk on the beach , or to have a picnic and were wearing their habits they would be asked to leave ? 
  give me a fucking break . 
  yeah , it 's called bdsm a lot of people are into that shit . 
  and it 's up to you to decide what 's degrading ? 
  news flash there are some people who think that skimpy bikinis are `` degrading '' to women . 
  i get laws about preventing full on facial covering , that can be convincingly argued as a security issue . 
  aside from that i think it 's best to let people do what they want , and that means some people will be stupid . 
  also this :  never express your own opinion unless the same opinion has already been expressed by the majority in the room , at least not until you get the hang of the social crowd . 
  norwegians tend to shy away from people who express opinions they disagree with . 
  people a little overly obsessed with conformity ? 
   the germans get up at the crack of dawn , go down to the beach or pool , leave their towels on a sunbed then go for breakfast or back to bed for a bit . 
  fixed that for you . 
  `` super carriers '' uh huh .
