   people live on islands , and use boats to fish . 
  they would see any turkish ship . 
  does n't mean they 're going to rush back to port and call the turkish navy . 
  yes , you can . 
  satellites have defined paths that can be avoided . 
  they can not see through things like clouds . 
  a naval ship is not readily distinguishable from other types of ships from space . 
  during the cold war the u.s. navy sailed ( during exercises ) entire carrier groups to within f4 range of soviet airbases . 
  they were n't detected until they ** intentionally ** broke cover , and even then it was an extreme effort for the soviets to locate an entire carrier strik group . 
  it is vastly over estimated just how much real time awareness any nation has over the entire globe , and turkey is not the top dog in this regard . 
  love you too , crush those god damn frenchies today please . 
  portugal portugal portugal !!, 
   `` if anyone claims that there is no democracy in poland today , they should undergo medical checks . '' that ... that is n't ... that 's not what i said . 
  please laugh . 
  what ? 
  no i was mostly implying that the german attitude of trying to suppress a minority of idiots is in error . 
  you 're better off just letting idiots be idiots and explaining why they 're idiots than outright criminalizing the saying of stupid things . 
  in essence i 'm saying that more open / less controlled societies seem to be better at dealing with these issues over time . 
  many northern europeans treat southern europeans in a manner similar to how racist americans treat mexicans . 
  ie * with an attitude of condescension and superiority , second class citizens who are lazy , perfectly nice people just not industrious like us americans . 
   in west germany , the first post-war generation in the 1960s openly rebelled against the former nazi generation that was still in control of the country . 
  what followed were decades of talking about it and proper education on the issue in schools . 
  so the part of germany that engaged the past and the racism now has reduced the problem , while the one that pretended there was no problem now has a big problem . 
  is n't that sort of an argument against the current policies being used in germany ( and other parts of europe ) ? 
  you 're joking but the attitude on this sub regarding this enormous scandal has been something of a `` move along , nothing to see here '' response . 
   that you do n't understand any of those in not europe 's problem . 
  we do , and if you visit school in europe you should emerge at least trilingual . 
  most hungarians do n't speak portuguese , and vice versa . 
  a significant number citizens in both nations speak english . 
  that is helpful for an entity which is trying to in some manner be unified . 
  you know ** most citizens being able to talk with each other ** . 
  unless you adopt some sort of general language most europeans wo n't even be able to talk to each other . 
  and it just so happens that english is by far and away the most convenient language to act as a general language . 
  i know eu policy is to encourage tri-lingual-ism if the english is removed as an eu language will english no longer be considered as one of those tri-lingual options receiving eu support ? 
  because to me , that would seem like a bad idea . 
   tall-as-fuck dutchies we may not all have your genetic elongation , but we have a saying for these unfortunate genetic oversights . 
  `` god created man , but samuel colt made them equal . '', 
  wait so are you actually going to move to another official language ? 
  and what are the implications for that and the populous learning english ? 
  because bitter at the uk or not the simple fact is that english is the global lingua franca . 
  the worlds largest economy primarily uses english , it 's the most common far reaching language in the eu , most of the western world will not be learning mandarin ( really too difficult ) , india even considers english to be a co-official language . 
  basically english is ** the ** language of trade and global commerce , for westerners in particular it is by far the most useful language . 
  so it would seem extremely silly for europe to change this policy just to what , spite britain ? 
  children , a bunch of god damned children , hopefully we do n't see a similar story regarding trump in november . 
  people sometimes like to be contrary under the assumption that they are part of the edgy minority . 
  the strange thing is that they do n't actually want to face the results of their rebellion , they just want to rebel , while living in the nicely functioning un-rebellious society . 
  i 'm hoping we do n't experience the same with trump . 
  as disgusted as i am with hrc . 
  i am not prepared to issue a `` fuck you '' vote to the establishment , if that means a potential crazy person ends up in control of button / american military . 
  it 's annoying being an adult sometimes , but while just throwing the finger to the system with no plan for the future might be satisfying , it 's pretty irresponsible . 
  i got mine , screw everyone else . 
  it 's a pretty typical human behavior . 
  amazon has ** successfully ** gotten a u.s. patent on `` one click purchases '' . 
  they actually are seriously anti-competitive , they do their damn best to use law / tax structures / etc. 
  to make it impossible for others to compete with them . 
  blue origin ( amazon owned company ) actually attempted to patent the concept of launching a rocket , and landing that rocket on a barge ( you know what space x has actually done ) . 
  that 's right a jeff bezos attempted to patent just the concept , not the particulars of achieving that concept . 
  just the ** idea ** of landing a rocket on a barge , despite the fact that it 's a really old idea . 
  new york really does have a pretty enormous tech startup community . 
  i 've had lots of contact with them , but i like them so i do n't really have anything negative to say . 
  romanians are awesome , they 've had a really hard history and a not particularly easy present . 
  they deal with a lot of shit , and prejudice from a lot of european countries , and yet they are n't bitchy or negative about it . 
  for me the easiest way to describe why i like romanians is by comparing them to hungarians . 
  you 've both dealt with a similarly shitty set of circumstances and despite being the poorer of the two countries romanians are friendly , fun , warm , and open . 
  and hungarians are grumpy , whinny , and have a persistent victim-hood complex that has a not insignificant portion of the population flirting with outright fascism . 
  so yeah , romania is cool , hard working people who are actually making better lives for themselves instead of constantly bitching . 
  your reputation as being a bit ... roguish , is deserved but i do n't really see it as a bad thing . 
  having a bit of an outlaw streak is good for society , do n't want to end up like fucking austrians , ie * breaking a rule may cause spontaneous brain aneurysm . 
  oh right you think you 're `` direct '' . 
  yep . 
  never been to the netherlands , just deal with a lot of dutch tourists . 
  my wife ( portuguese ) lived in the netherlands for three years and she ca n't stand them , because she felt they always treated her like a second class citizen . 
  dark hair , dark skin , dark eyes ? 
  well you must be turkish , or moroccan or something , definitely not one of us . 
  also they tend to be quite friendly to your face and then they leave you a shitty whiny review , or bitchy feedback , about things they never bothered to bring to your attention . 
  direct my ass . 
  they 're racists , and probably sleeping with their cousins , i meet fewer people from alabama than people from france . 
  eh i would but the british are already so good at making fun of themselves . 
  with countries and people the ones who understand their many many faults ( and we all have them ) and can acknowledge them , and make fun of themselves , without getting their panties twisted , they 're just so much more likable . 
  the british are cocky , and self obsessed , and have a major superiority complex , and they 're also kind of dull and trashy , but they at least fucking know it . 
  and that makes all of the above funny , instead of annoying . 
  but the dutch / belgians etc. 
  do n't make fun of themselves , certainly not to the degree the british do . 
  in a technical sense sure , but being connected to the mainland seems to have neutered their personality or something . 
  i do n't think i 've met many danes from zealand , maybe they 're more fun . 
  oh do n't get me wrong , you 're fucking annoying , but at least you 're legitimately aggravating . 
  the lowlanders do n't even have the good graces to be abrasive to your face . 
  they 're just sort of unpleasant , but they 're so quiet and boring about it that it 's hard to be pissed at them in a coherent way . 
  at least the french have balls , at least you can get into a decent fight with them . 
  the lowlanders are so whatever that you ca n't even have an argument with them , they either do n't have the balls , or they 're just so arrogant that they see fighting as unnecessary because they 're so obviously right that an argument would be pointless . 
  i 've met people from luxembourg , and i did n't find you any more unpleasant than the rest of the lowlanders . 
  in my mind the danes , the dutch , the luxembourgers , and the belgians are all lumped together as a group of dull , vaguely unpleasant people , who do n't have much to say but always project a quiet air of superiority . 
  basically a bunch of typical western europeans without the somewhat endearing arrogance of the french , the self awareness of the germans or the friendliness of the scandinavians . 
  tldr : i do n't think you 're any worse than a bunch of people i basically do n't like . 
  for me it 's more the desire to have a conversation but the total awkwardness of it . 
  i deal with a lot of german tourists and i very often get the impression that they want to talk with me . 
  while at the same time they 're just really awkward and they are n't good at carrying on that conversation in a `` natural '' manner . 
  then there 's the self effacing attitude of `` our bad , we fucked up '' which resides awkwardly right beside the attitude of `` but really , we know what we 're doing and you americans should totally take a chapter from our playbook '' . 
  the whole nazism thing is obviously very over the top , and it dates the sketch more than anything else . 
  but from my personal experience at least the other elements have a note of truth .
