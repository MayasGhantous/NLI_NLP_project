  i do n't really think humor needs to be `` smart '' what 's funny is mostly conveying something that 's true . 
  and the skit really does getting something right about how i perceive germans ( especially german tourists ) . 
  and that 's what makes it funny , it strikes a note of truth . 
  well yeah , it is n't funny . 
  but still funnier than the german opinion of britain . 
  good comedy ages well , shitty comedy is shitty no matter the vintage . 
  i love fat tire !, 
  what 's a belgium ? 
  looks like they made a solid landing and did n't even block traffic . 
  so hot in the face . 
  it 's relative stagnation , we are n't at zero but 2 % year on year growth while several major economies are in recessions is not an economic boom time . 
  damn romania , you killing it , relatively rapid gdp growth , hugely reduced crime rate . 
  all during a period of economic stagnation . 
   tortilla ? 
  those used in burritos ? 
  it might hurt your feelings but tortilla means flat flower or corn bread to way more people , than it means dish made with potatoes and eggs or something . 
  not that tortilla is n't good , but you 're fighting a losing battle there amigo . 
  i really just want to be able to vote for obama again , is that so much to ask ? 
  hey i 've never called a french a surrender monkey , i 've just quietly thought it . 
  usually with a french accent :  `` you know we think you americans are crazy for ____ xyz ____ reason . '', 
  cool , thanks for telling me , i did n't ask and i really do n't give a shit about your opinion on the issue . 
  but by all means lets continue . 
  i mean i totally agree , in what world could teaching a dog how to do the nazi salute be funny ? 
  i mean it 's just sad indoctrinated our pugs with nazi propaganda , and ** now ** the dog gets excited at the prospect of `` gassing the jew 's '' how awful . 
  i 'll have you know that the holocaust was tragic event and making jokes about the holocaust is ** wrong ** and ** offensive ** and ** not funny ** . 
  there is no excuse for this sort of behavior , there are lots of clean and funny jokes . 
  like this one a ) my dog has no nose !, 
  b ) how does he smell ? 
  a ) awful !, 
  hahaha !, 
  ( three laughs is the appropriate number of laughs four laughs should be considered unnecessary exuberance and punished with jail time ) . 
  this joke is funny and appropriate , and this is the sort of humor we should be teaching our dogs . 
  they are n't real racoons , they are n't even closely related to racoons . 
  the amish ( men at least ) are usually highly educated in practical trades . 
  advanced plumbing / construction / finish carpentry skills in the united states are way more valuable than a high school diploma . 
  highly skilled trades people do n't have much difficulty pulling down 100k plus per year . 
  i 'm guessing the amish women are much less educated in these practical trades , they 're much more trapped in the system than the men are . 
  their education continues past the 8th grade . 
  their continued education just is n't academic . 
  they are extremely skilled in a wide variety of trades that make them extremely valuable to both the amish community and everyone else . 
  the amish are high end business people , they just have a strong cultural bent towards practical trades . 
  you know what 's extremely underated ? 
  yellow bellies , yellow is a nice color why not cover your stomach in it ? 
  dear god i wish all i had to be embarrassed about was a shitty newspaper headlines , count your blessings man . 
  little known fact color was actually invented before the conclusion of the war in 1939 , in kansas . 
  there is even live footage available of the transition from a black and white world to a color world . 
  more like it 's fucking insulting , so people are offended ? 
   it 's a nice and sturdy diesel , much unlike the abrahms . 
  it 's america , we like jets , we even put jet engines on our tanks . 
  some of the medium hard salty goat cheese . 
  and some of the buttery soft cheese but with cows milk not sheep . 
  yeah most places are more predictable than that . 
  new york 's weather is famously all over the place ( sudden temperature swings are pretty typical ) . 
  but as a general rule if you tell me you 'll be here between mid-november and mid-march i can pretty much say it will be cold . 
  you might get lucky there 's usually some not so bad weeks thrown in there , but for the most part it 's cold and kind of gray and dark . 
  there 's usually 1 or 2 semi major snow storms a year . 
  this winter was strange we had some 70f / 20c + weather in february . 
  and that has n't happened since 1997 , but on the flip side while the end of february was freakishly warm , the start of march has been pretty cold , snow in the forecast tomorrow , and possibly a major storm early next week dropping up to 30cm of snow . 
  temperatures ranging between 0c and -8 c. 
  it 's almost 18c out right now so you get my meaning when i say that temperature swings are pretty wild . 
  but it illustrates my point pretty well , hows the weather in nyc between nov 15th and march 15th ? 
  it 's shitty , every now and then it 's nice but for the most part , winter sucks . 
   she 'll then be a little homesick , so try to perk her up by finding the closest spot that sells her favorite food from back home . 
  it 's called new jersey , and it 's right on the other side of the river . 
  got some portuguese cheese in our fridge right now . 
  there 's a distinct possibility that she 's just a huge wimp about cold , and has ridiculous standards for what constitutes `` good '' weather . 
  though to be fair she 's toughed out her first nyc winter reasonably well . 
  that being said we 've had an impossibly mild winter this year 18 to 20 + c days during january and february . 
  my portuguese wife says that winter in portugal is usually shit , non-stop rain , cold ( not super cold but cold enough to be uncomfortable ) . 
  so i 'm guessing this is an unusually nice day ? 
  i mean ... sort of . 
  i live in new york , i 've got a model friend . 
  a rich old dude ( and i do n't mean silver fox ) , pays for her apartment , for her school , for all of her stuff , bags , jewelry , electronics , vacations , etc. 
  and in exchange she pretty much does whatever he wants , he 's got her class schedule and so he 'll literally just book a flight for her and say `` you do n't have class , you 'll meet me in paris from date x to date y '' . 
  is she a whore ? 
  i mean she definitely would n't call herself that but practically speaking ... not that i 'm judging , i think she 's smart she 'll walk away with a degree and zero debt . 
  i 'm just saying that nobody thinks they 're a prostitute until someone offers them enough money . 
   will go out in a while , it is windy today though . 
  go learn kite-boarding !, 
  i 'm sure there 's a school on most greek islands !, 
  sounds like you picked a good time to be on vacation , get off reddit go hangout by the street grills . 
  mattis did n't give a hard deadline , he said that adjustments should be made to start moving things in the right direction . 
  many countries are n't even moving towards the goal , and 2024 is nearer every day . 
  it 's funny crossing that super modern bridge , and looking out on the marshes , where fisherman in wood skiffs are out picking clams at low tide . 
  very portugal . 
  what is with all these weirdos and their weird fucking hair ?!? 
  [ well it 's good to see we 're running ahead of schedule , did it in only 15.3 years ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=612deotfh0o ), 
   it 's just about some rural community discriminating against anyone that doesnt share their views . 
  which is actually very undemocratic . 
  but it is very swiss at least . 
  it 's switzerland they do n't want anyone in their towns that stands out , simple as that . 
  so flat ... hnnnnnngggg, 
  is kiteboarding allowed here ? 
  because this would be a perfect , perfect , spot for it . 
  it 's just sorta of bizzare how unconcerned everyone seems to be . 
  the burning of 650 cars would be on par with orr significantly worse than the ** very worst ** rioting / protests in the u.s. over the last two years . 
  events which received no small amount of international attention , critique , commentary , etc. 
  it 's a bit strange that when it happens in paris , annually , it 's barely remarked upon . 
  cultural appropriation , that 's cultural appropriation !, 
   besides the fact that it is stupid to quantify murder like that , for the sake of argument , you have like 4-5 thousand dead there .
