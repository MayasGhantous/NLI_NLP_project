  it 's not about the number of murders , more about the nature of the evident ( s ) and their cause . 
   iraq invasion killed ( even conservative estimates ) way over 100.000 people , not even considering the destabilization of the region and isis . 
  death toll of the iraq invasion is currently estimated at between [ 168,000 and 188,000 ] ( https://www.iraqbodycount.org ) of course the vast majority of those deaths were brown people killing other brown people ** so i guess that does n't count ** ? 
  and go wank it to the splc 's blacklist , are we done here ? 
  you 've put some words on paper but i 'll be damned if they mean anything . 
  no , there really are n't .

  they are not the same , and the behavior of their followers are not the same .

  these things ** do not have analogues ** in the the born again movement , or the southern baptist movements in the u.s. 
  there is are many many problems ** in islam ** in the modern era . 
  and it is not racist or ignorant to acknowledge that these problems exist , they are not all the `` fault '' of `` the west '' . 
  we need to start speaking seriously about this issue , which does n't mean blanket discrimination against muslims . 
  but we need to get our head out of the fucking sand and recognize that there is a problem , and constantly wringing our hands and saying `` the vast majority of muslims , blah blah blah '' will not solve these issues . 
  oh so they did n't catch him at a weird moment , he 's always wearing that expression . 
  the definition varies depending on your source , in either case that dude ai n't middle aged , he old . 
  i honestly would n't trump is chaos , and chaos may be preferable to a known evil monster creature .

   that old man and his middle aged trophy wife , but do n't worry it 's totally respectable she has a degree . 
  unlike the american presidents trophy wife without a degree and always posing in bikinis , with guns , on her husbands airplane labeled all over with his name . 
  i hope we can find a happy middle ground ? 
   middle aged couple it 's ok buddy , we all get old , just accept that you 're old and you 'll feel better about it . 
  you know how they say people start to look like their dogs ? 
  as someone who interacts with a lot of europeans , i do n't object to the awkward silences . 
  what i do object to is the way europeans keep hovering around even when they apparently are done speaking . 
  it makes me feel like they want to socialize but at the same time they are n't trying to socialize . 
  when i reach an awkward silence i just kind of say `` yeah i 've got shit to do '' and walk away , and do some shit . 
  americans will respond with `` yeah me too '' and they will go off and do other shit . 
  but with europeans i frequently hit this point where no-one has anything to say , and they do n't need have any reason to be where i am , but they wo n't fuck off . 
  maybe the problem is that american culture is kind of binary , we love to socialize and talk and interact , but we also really like to be alone . 
  europeans seem more comfortable just being around each other and not interacting , which makes ( at least some ) americans uncomfortable . 
  [ nobody puts balls through hoops like we do . 
  are you saying i 've got a problem !? 
  they can be reasonably compared , the italian carriers are singificantly smaller , and they operate harriers which are arguably a lower class of aircraft . 
  that said without a catapult the russians are hardly launching fully armed and loaded aircraft themselves and their air wing also is n't very large or capable of rapid sortie generation . 
  their crews and pilots are also relatively inexperienced as demonstrated by the recent accidents . 
  honestly if i had to pick between the italian carriers and the admiral kuznetsov i 'd take the italians . 
  they 've more reasonably accessed their budgets and their achievable operational level . 
  the russian option is too expensive and too dangerous and they 're very likely to be totally incapable of performing an operation when needed . 
  the italian theoretical peak capability is lesser but you could actually feel certain that an italian carrier , crew , and air wing would be able to effectively execute a deployment . 
  with the russians its a complete coin toss , the ship is constantly laid up and in need of an overhaul they ca n't afford , the air crews are n't receiving the regular training that is required , and the crews spent so little time at sea operating the equipment their speed / familiarity / skill must suffer a lot . 
  oh cool there 's a club ? 
  well there 's a silver lining after all i love clubs .

  best airline food i 've ever had . 
  ohhhh canada , my home and native land !, 
  sorry , i tried this is as close as americans can get ... 
  do n't worry they only complain about that sort of thing when they 're out of power . 
  miraculously as soon as they 've won they election and they 're in power the debt and the deficit no longer matter . 
  eh most do n't but if you 're solidly middle class you 'll definitely know plenty of people who have spent time in europe . 
  well not op but the first time i came to europe i went east to the less visited countries . 
  simply because everyone and their mom visits france / germany / italy / spain and i wanted to go somewhere a little different . 
  that is n't horrifyingly inhumane at all ... 
  this is the least surprising thing i 've read in the last month . 
  well he might be the new secretary of state , so kind of relevant . 
  voted for hillary , yeah she was / is super weird , creepy , unnatural , and un-genuine to a frankly disturbing degree . 
  as much as i am profoundly freaked out by the idea of president trump the fact that she managed to lose is totally unsurprising . 
  i mean what 's with the fucking giggling , you 're talking about killing people ?!, 
   the problem though is that in their frustration both the brits and americans decided to vote for something that will make their countries more neo-liberal , not less . 
  oh i know , we 've been here before . 
  all the reasons people claim to be voting for trump will be thrown out ( even stuff like build a wall ) but his constituents wo n't notice / wo n't care / wo n't understand / will blame obama . 
  that 's just how it is to be a liberal in the u.s. you spend a lot of time arguing with brick walls . 
  and pointing things out like `` facts '' or `` records '' or `` broken campaign promises '' carries very little weight . 
  that being said even after this election it is abundantly clear that ** most ** americans do n't see trump as the future . 
  they just need someone to actually inspire them to get out and vote for a cause they feel will actually aid their day to day life . 
  and while voting the lesser of two evils is the pragmatic and logical thing to do it is n't inspiring and it 's past time for the democratic party to inspire people again , rather than just being the `` not crazy '' people . 
  the obama administration had the opportunity to prosecute the bankers ( see fraudsters ) who were responsible for the 2008 crisis . 
  and they basically decided not to do ** anything ** significant ( fines are not a fitting punishment for criminal fraud ) because they were worried that they 'd damage `` the market '' . 
  i voted for clinton , but i can absolutely understand why there was a huge deficit of support / enthusiasm for her . 
  all were doing is voting against the other side while progressive views and candidates are largely derided and ignored by the `` liberal media '' . 
  the last generation , ever since carter changed the home brewing laws and there 's been a microbrewery explosion a lot of people have switched to better quality beer . 
  some people just do n't care and they 'll drink bud light because it 's cheap and contains alcohol . 
  what exactly are googles practices exactly as you understand them and what makes their behavior unique compared to other companies who are n't being pursued for these fines ?

  the motivation behind brexit is n't and was n't ** logically consistent ** in any way . 
  the promised benefits of exiting outright contradict the tangible benefits of the union . 
  and those benefits are central to ** being a part of the union ** . 
  in much the same way that american voters elected someone who demonstrated no logical consistency with his promises . 
  you can not build a wall , get better healthcare , increase military spending , cut taxes , ** and ** reduce the deficit . 
  and surprise surprise these contradictory promises have led to paralysis and inaction . 
  keep up with the news , they hacked into voter registries , that means that if they had n't been caught ** before ** the election , they very well may have been able to alter results . 
  simply by removing people from voter registry you could prevent people from voting and considering the extremely narrow margins in some states this could ** easily ** change the results of the election . 
  i 'm not saying this actually happened , but do n't pretend that all the russians did was hack into some embarrassing internal democratic communications , no , they hacked central parts of electoral infrastructure in 39 states . 
  yes , you did . 
  https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/iduskcn11m153 and you did not pay russia a penalty you simply returned the funds they 'd pre-paid . 
  tldr : i am dumb, 
  you realize it goes way beyond leaked emails ? 
  russia hacked into the voter registrys of ** 39 states ** . 
  europe spent several centuries raping your way across every continent on earth before turning around and finally doing the same to each other . 
  now are we done with history class so we can get back to talking bout the matter at hand ? 
  oh please you sold the ships to egypt at full price .

  there 's something about her face that makes me think she already wants to complain to my manager .

  that 's not what my wife says ...
