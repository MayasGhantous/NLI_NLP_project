lets not forget that irish people being generally biewed in a positive light in general on a global scale is a rather recent development . 
  around the turn of the century , irish immigrants and their descendents [ were definitely not treated well in the us . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-irish_sentiment ) i 'm neither , but if i had to guess ( and maybe i 'm talking out my ass so correct me if i 'm wrong , of course ) , i would imagine that the anti-irish sentiment would lead to a lot of children being told `` never stop being proud of being irish , no matter what the kids at school say '' from their parents , and that that same pride would cause the irish in ireland to look skeptically at the irish diaspora and their descendants when they claim to be irish . 
  * i totally agree . 
  i need practice . 
  german tv is easy to come by but norwegian dubs are basically nonexistent . 
  chill brah , do n't get all sad and bail just 'cause you do n't speak some crazy language . 
  be stoked on how you speak . 
  west coast best coast . 
  * it 's not so bad . 
  you do n't have to get upset and leave just because english happens to be your first language . 
  we can still have our own fun with some regional slang . 
  just do n't call it cali . 
  i think it 's just because i like to find my cursor by throwing it against the left edge of the screen and i have a feel for how far i have to rebound it to line it up with the comments link . 
  when there 's a little bit of extra space it feels weird . 
  i like the way that sub looks , though . 
  there 's probably so much extra space that i notice it easily , and so it does n't throw me off . 
  this sub is n't guilty of this ( and it does n't look like your preview is either ) , but i 'm not a fan of when subreddit styles move the vote arrows far from where they are on the front page or a non-styled sub . 
  i had to disable the style on / r/askreddit . 
  i do n't speak for every redditor , obviously , but it 's a thing that bugs me . 
  if you 've never done it , i recommend taking a trip [ up highway 1 ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@35.730617,-121.314333,3a,75y,348.97h,88.31t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s5iu_tyhkfdt9ix8ksokopg!2e0 ) next time you 're out here . 
  specifically the stretch from san luis obispo to monterey . 
  and the midwest is nuts . 
  see how [ this area ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vturgik.jpg ) is a weird light green color ? 
  if you street view a random road , there 's a pretty good chance you 'll see [ something like this . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@42.425802,-89.17949,3a,75y,266.58h,88.4t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sw8ztijpr3yi3s9yjpg-emg!2e0 ) if there are no trees in the way , the corn can stretch to the horizon ahead of you , behind you , and on both sides . 
  and if there are trees , it goes to the horizon behind them anyway . 
  i do n't know how well that area would be able to support the entire danish population , but based on [ this , ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jrks0cu.gif ) it looks like half of you are packed into the capital region anyway . 
  oh it was n't anything you said . 
  i actually came in here kind of hoping someone would bring it up . 
  it 's just that i was 11 or 12 years old at the time and did n't realize that it was anything more than a passing attempt of fox news to rile people up . 
  but the government was involved too !, 
  i remember hearing that some people stopped shopping at target because they thought it was a french company . 
  in reality , it 's been based in minneapolis since it was founded ... edit : removed a doubled word, 
  wow , i never realized how far we took that . 
  i always thought it was just our media being our media . 
  i ca n't believe there 's still some businesses that stuck with it . 
  the article says a poll found that 66 % thought it was silly . 
  i 'm surprised it was that low . 
  i 've never heard anyone use the term in a serious conversation , then or now . 
  i do n't . 
  a lot of it is true . 
  i 'm not sure how serious he was being , but i 'd believe you if you said there are people that think that way . 
  making a comparison like that is like saying california culture is surfing and hot babes and tacos , and louisiana culture is racism and poverty . 
  or that greek culture is being the cradle of western civilization , and turkish culture is being about being butthurt about greece and the armenian genocide . 
  it 's not like we do n't have charming cities or polite and gentle people . 
  the issue i had with his comment was n't about sports . 
  i 'm okay with people liking things i do n't like and vice versa . 
  but comparing the best of europe with the worst of the us is kind of stupid . 
  edit : and i 'd have expected better from an international subreddit like this . 
  and i 'm not really sure what 's so bad about having big cities . 
  istanbul , london , and berlin are huge too and the urban population percentage of the us is comparable to a lot of european countries . 
  you 're the butthurt one if you think my post was serious . 
  i know it 's hard to imagine being part of a non-monolithic sports culture , but the truth is that some countries like certain things , and other countries like other things , and * that 's okay * . 
  it 's not something to get upset over . 
  no i think their sport is called epl . 
  germany has a pretty good team though . 
  this summer i saw germany play elp against ireland ( they were green and yellow , anyway ) and germany won like 7-1 . 
  man you really have us figured out , do n't you ? 
  it 's true though . 
  one time i was watching soccer ( we do n't give a single fuck about this , i 'm glad you guys only play it once every four years ) and all i could think about was getting back to mcdonalds . 
  the biggest difference looks like it 's in the volume units . 
  do you really use ounces , pints , quarts , and gallons often enough to have a preference ? 
  is n't it easier just to use liters ? 
  unless i 'm measuring milk and that volume happens to be 1 gallon , non-metric volume units are completely useless to me . 
  i think there 's a distinction between `` introduce you to [ someone ] '' and `` introduce [ someone ] to you '' that has to do with which person is being brought or `` shown '' and which is doing the seeing , or which person is more important in the context of the introduction . 
  say i 'm a king 's senior advisor you 're just my friend . 
  the king does n't know you and he probably does n't care about you one way or the other . 
  i could say `` i 'm going to introduce you to the king '' and it would be fine , but saying `` i 'm going to introduce the king to you '' sounds kind of weird . 
  i would only say the second one if the king were a guitarist and a huge ozzy fan and you happened to be randy rhoads . 
  the relationship of the first one is person/king but the second one is fan/musician . 
  the way i 've always heard it is `` austria 's greatest achievement is convincing the world that beethoven was austrian and hitler was german . '', 
  i ca n't tell if op 's map is accounting for size distortion from the map projection , but [ this one definitely is ] ( http://mapfrappe.com/?show=30560 ) and it even makes it look a little bigger . 
  edit : yep . 
  slide it around and it can touch ireland and newfoundland . 
  i 'd say embedding is common , but not three layers deep like that . 
  the sentence definitely sounds like one that was purposefully constructed to be confusing and hard to read . 
  it would be just as hard to say as it would be to understand . 
  the longer they get , the better off you 'd be to put the information in multiple sentences . 
  there is n't really anything special going on . 
  sometimes we drop tje `` that '' that would normally separate the phrases . 
  short ones are all over the place . 
  the food * i had this morning * was great . 
  the package * you sent * arrived late . 
  the two sentences * i just wrote * rhyme . 
  the rat * the cat chased * escaped . 
  if i drop the `` that , '' i change my voice a little to set the insertions apart from the rest of the sentence . 
  maybe little deeper , faster , or quieter . 
  it can be cleared up a lot by keeping `` that , '' and if this were spoken aloud , by adding a short pause to separate the phrases too . 
  the food * that i had this morning * ... was great . 
  the rat * that the cat chased * ... escaped . 
  the pauses are n't long at all , though . 
  they 're just long enough to make it clear that i 'm not trying to say `` chased escaped '' as if it 's a single thing . 
  hopefully that makes sense . 
  as a native speaker , the only reasoning i can give ( < -- ha there 's another example ! ), 
  is `` because it sounds right '' which is pretty unhelpful . 
  that sounds pretty similar to [ garden path sentences , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/garden_path_sentence ) which take advantage of how some nouns , verbs , or participles can be identical . 
  `` the horse raced past the barn fell . '', 
  `` the old man the boats . '', 
  if you 're feeling stingy with commas , you might even end up with something like `` the rat the cat the dog bit chased escaped . '',
