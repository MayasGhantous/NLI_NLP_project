  but it 's another thing to impersonate us . 
  thanks , europe !, 
  now how about i tell you how to fix all your problems , because i know your situation so well !, 
  first , what you really need to do is to convert your europoor `` money '' into good , ol' - fashioned dollars ... 
  thanks for the clarification, 
   the liberal parts of reddit are usually the ones frequented by americans . 
  yeah , educated/middle class americans are more liberal than europeans seem to think we are, 
  not to mention them dumping off the christians, 
  oh , well there we go, 
  `` putain '' ... whore ? 
  i speak spanish , not french , but the similarity is interesting, 
  do they have an equivalent to the us national guard ? 
  i 'm surprised that they do n't deploy whatever the french equivalent of the us national guard is, 
  come to texas . 
  the austin area has quite a few due to the german influence on central texas . 
   we 're a very self loathing people even compared to other ex-commies . 
  good guy bulgarian -- willing to fight so that other people do n't get saddled with the misery of being bulgarian, 
   military conflicts are usually ` solved ' by the us with some support from the european states . 
  what does this mean , then , for a russian invasion of a nato country ? 
  because it sounds an awful lot like americans dying while you sit on your ass and `` support '' us . 
  this makes me so fucking mad , though . 
  we love you too , uk, 
   i think nato is a good deterrent but a bad thing once you actually have to follow through with it . 
  wow ... just wow . 
  flair up . 
  are you american too ? 
  yeah , i do n't know why we 'd volunteer to die for people who do n't like us . 
  yeah this made me fucking furious . 
  are american lives worth less to these fucks ? 
  we 're people too , ya ' know . 
  but i guess it 's easy to let * other * people 's children die for you instead of protecting yourselves . 
  you 'll still be close to us . 
  americans fucking love the uk , canada , and australia . 
  except you can think of it that way . 
  your citizens voted . 
  so should americans , who have sons and friends in our military , trust you to uphold your agreements ? 
  are you an * honorable * sort of people that we can rely on ? 
  it pisses me off because it makes me think that these nations feel that american lives are worth less than theirs . 
  let us shed the blood , right ? 
  and then when america involves ourselves , the same people scream about america being the `` world police '' or `` overreaching '' or whatever . 
  guess what ? 
  you ca n't have it both ways . 
  it 's all right . 
  we 're already pretty aware that american lives are n't worth a fuck to you . 
   you can be pedantic if you want . 
  i think that 's what most people would prefer to be here . 
  or just ... you know ... correct . 
  america is the biggest player in nato and the team captain , like it or not ... hence why many european countries are ambivalent about nato . 
  america is n't a member of the eu . 
  that 's a pretty stark difference . 
  i 'll take it . 
  america can into eu ? 
  americans are ... well , we 're americans , texans , whatever . 
  whereas in my experience , canadians try to play up their `` not american-ness '' to emphasize their own culture . 
  honestly , we 're pretty similar . 
  we have a lot in common with australians as well, 
  * cracks whip * yeah , canada ... bomb that middle eastern shithole ... bomb it good 'n' slow, 
  plus you always hear about stripper poles , so polish people must be especially attractive, 
   english and american pop culture is very very ungenerous towards him , and always paints the man in a negative light . 
  actually we like napoleon because of the louisiana purchase . 
  we do that in english . 
  `` hottie '' , `` blondie '' , `` shorty '' , etc. 
  ah , but then there 's the american country breakfast . 
  when i was a boy , my grandfather would take me fishing , and my grandmother would cook us a massive breakfast . 
  her folks were pig farmers in rural oklahoma , and although she was college-educated , she had rough hands , strong hands . 
  that woman could * cook * . 
  baskets of soft , buttery biscuits , doughy rolls , ham off the bone . 
  fresh persimmon jelly , eggs scrambled or over medium , cream of wheat or oatmeal , and even pancakes or grits if we were lucky . 
  we 'd eat in their big dining room , watch the morning mist curling lazily off the lake as the sun rose and birds started to sing . 
  and then , once we were full , it was off to my grandfather 's battered ford , willie on the radio , and two lunchboxes with ham sandwiches and cokes in our hands . 
  i like living in a city now , but i 'd be lying if i said there are n't things i look back on fondly from being a kid out in the country . 
  it 's more that i doubt soldiers from an allied country would go kidnapping our citizens . 
  i 'd be really surprised if they pulled that shit on an american, 
  i 'm not a yankee !, 
  i 'm from the south !, 
  i 'm pretty fond of the sr556 ( piston-driven ) , but i do n't know how they 'd handle in sub-zero temps . 
  mosin-nagant it is !, 
  wait , they did n't play skull-football at your church ? 
  nope , i 'm referring to the * other * [ dagon ] ( http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2013/040/2/5/dagon__demon_prince_of_the_sea_by_michaeljaecks-d5ubvvz.jpg ), 
  yep , we unwashed barbarians literally wipe our asses with corncobs and literally sacrifice family members to dagon . 
  this is n't / r/askhistorians , but i 'll humor you , despite the fact that i feel like you 're just trying to play `` gotcha '' with me . 
   american aircraft , flown by russian ferry pilots across the vast expanse of siberia , were put to good use by the soviet air forces even with planes that were less than popular with western pilots . 
  a case in point was the bell p-39 airacobra , used both as a low-altitude fighter and as ground support . 
  ** its odd shape gave soviet censors fits because it was difficult to conceal that it was the favorite mount of their second-highest-ranking ace , the future marshal of aviation , aleksandar i. 
  ** http://www.historynet.com/russias-life-saver-lend-lease-aid-to-the-ussr-in-world-war-ii-book-review.htm, 
  the soviets had a nasty habit of not mentioning to their men what was american and what was n't . 
  it was a propaganda move . 
  i 've read anecdotal stories of soviet soldiers being surprised when they saw american soldiers with garands , m1 carbines , and jeeps because the russian personnel had assumed that was soviet-made hardware . 
  / u/live _ free noted that  it has been estimated that american deliveries to the ussr through the persian corridor alone were sufficient , by us army standards , to maintain ** sixty combat divisions ** in the line sixty divisions is an absolute * fuckton * of men . 
  a modern us army division is like 20,000 guys , and i 'm about to look up a wwii one for you . 
  from the wiki breakdown [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/united_states_world_war_ii_ ( square \\ ) _ infantry_division_1940_structure . png ) i 'm thinking maybe 13-15 ,000 men in a 1940 infantry division . 
  that may be way off , though . 
  who are `` you guys '' ? 
  i like the eu flag . 
  it has a nice simplicity to it , some elegance . 
  the [ nato flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/flag_of_nato.svg/1024px-flag_of_nato.svg.png ) is nice as well, 
  james bond should be a fighting a muscular eastern european man there, 
  do n't worry , it 's just more russian bullshit . 
  damn , just eight hours . 
  that 's fucking amazing to me , as an american in a right-to-work state .
