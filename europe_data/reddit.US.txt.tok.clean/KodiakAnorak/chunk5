  your great-grandfather was either exaggerating or mistaken . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35aswe/survey_in_france_what_is_according_to_you_the/cr2vrjy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_production_during_world_war_ii#production_overview:_service.2c_power_and_type / u/live _ free gave a great answer, 
  russians also seem to conveniently forget that while the united states did n't contribute as much blood as they did , we pumped a ton of weapons , supplies , and equipment into the allies . 
  we also laid down quite an ass-beat on the japanese , so there 's that . 
  he * always * has his big stick, 
  someday teddy roosevelt will burst forth from the capitol dome on a horse made of flame , wielding two winchesters, 
  it 's okay , they do n't even get texas right most of the time and we 're in the same country . 
  no country for old men did a good job , though . 
  no country for old men , beyond the action-filled bits , is pretty accurate to west texas . 
  a bunch of it was filmed near marfa, 
  it 's cool , he 'll get upvoted because this is / r/europe and oooh !, 
  guns are scary !, 
  regardless of ... you know ... whether what he 's saying is factual or not . 
  except if you 're taking entire families into account , that includes babies , children , and invalids . 
  households is a better metric for adult gun ownership . 
   less than half -- 44 percent -- said no one in their household owns a gun . 
   nearly one in four said they or a member of their family is a member of the nra , and less than half -- 44 percent -- said no one in their household owns a gun . 
  as for the rest , 43 percent said they or a member of their family owns a gun , and 13 percent answered `` prefer not to say . ''  most of those who do own guns own more than one . 
  only 19 percent said they and their families own one firearm , 44 percent said they own two to five , 20 percent said they own more than five guns , and the rest chose `` prefer not to say . '' -- http://www.texastribune.org/2013/03/05/uttt-poll-texans-mostly-dont-want-more-gun-laws/, 
   is it ok to have an event mocking jesus , just because some kkk idiots are being idiots ? 
  piss christ is a thing . 
  nobody was killed over it, 
  or maybe something like the atlantic treaty organization ... north american treaty organization ... new atlantic trade organization ... 
  i mean , i 'm just spitballing here , but an organization that furthers defensive ties between north america and europe would probably be a good thing . 
  soldiers are disarmed on army posts , for the most part . 
  they ca n't even protect themselves . 
  we trust them to carry a gun in * other * countries , though . 
  just not our own . 
  it 's a fucked up system . 
  way off ? 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  i split my time between texas and oklahoma , and there are a ton of gun owners both places ... including me . 
  [ * you wild colorado * , johnny cash ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oclaz2fparc ) just a nice sound to it , very american . 
  lots of native americans and modern-day cowboys where i grew up , so i can identify with it . 
  reminds me of tinkering on cars and motorcycles with my old man , or just hitting a fishing hole on a warm summer day . 
  it 's just * a * prince ? 
  i thought it had to be prince ... at least , in the most traditional stories, 
  hmm now you 've got me . 
  and the hunt for red october . 
  iirc the captain in the tom clancy book was lithuanian, 
  would n't the stereotype be that you * never * eat potatoes ? 
  excellent, 
  but you see the point i 'm making ? 
  same directors , but look at the difference . 
  that 's like america as a whole -- same foundation , but very different style and culture depending on location, 
  you could n't tell the difference between * no country for old men * and * fargo * ? 
  are you just feeling argumentative today for some reason ? 
  damn dude , maybe you need to eat a snickers, 
  america is much larger than any european nation ( unless you count russia , of course ), 
  ** texas and oklahoma ** ( america is too diverse between regions to easily stereotype , i think . 
  new yorkers have different stereotypes than us ) * ranches -- yes . 
  my grandfather divested himself of cattle this year , but up until that point he had about 100 head . 
  that 's not a huge number for here . 
  cattle are common outside of cities . 
  * cowboys -- not as much . 
  although i 've worked with cattle , can ride a horse , have/can shoot lots of guns , etc. 
  i would n't consider myself to be a cowboy . 
  there are n't really trail rides anymore , and with modern conveniences like atvs ... well , ranching is quite a bit easier . 
  there are still a few cowboys out there , but not many . 
  * guns -- yes . 
  yes . 
  ** yes ** . 
  i 'm pretty liberal ( in american terms ) , but i still have a gun cabinet in my bedroom , a gun safe in the garage , and a license to carry a handgun when i wish . 
  around here almost everyone has firearms , regardless of whether they 're liberal or conservative . 
  i can see five guns from where i 'm sitting now . 
  we do n't really regard them as problematic in the same way that new yorkers or californians do . 
  * fatness -- yes . 
  depends on location , though . 
  austin is very fit . 
  lubbock seemed very fat . 
  i think this has less to do with the personal character of americans and more to do with outside factors , though . 
  people with jobs tend to get worked like slaves , which makes fast food a very attractive option ( as well as cheapness ) . 
  we have lots of poor people , and poor people foods tend to be laden with fat and salt in order to make cheap foods taste good . 
  * violence -- mehhhhh , not sure ? 
  i think that all human beings have ( on average ) the same capacity for violence . 
  some people are more violent than others , but that 's an individual thing . 
  but without universal medical care , we have no support network for mental health . 
  it 's not like you can check into an emergency room for it , most of the time . 
  and i think that has caused long-term issues . 
  in addition , i think a lot of violence here is driven by economic desperation . 
  * militarism -- no . 
  iirc only about 1 % of our population serves/has served in the military . 
  i do n't think we 're any more militaristic than other `` superpowers '' / historical empires ( such as the british , romans , etc ) . 
  i feel like people tend to shit all over america for `` military adventurism '' without considering the fact that if their country was in the same position , they 'd do the exact same things . 
  plus we get criticized no matter what -- when anything goes wrong , people ask why america is n't intervening to fix it . 
  then , when we do intervene , people say that we 're trying to `` police the world '' or whatever . 
  * greed -- not sure on this one , either . 
  some people here are incredibly acquisitive , but most people are just trying to get by . 
  on the other hand , who would n't want to be wealthy ? 
  or at least comfortable enough not to have to worry about money ? 
  but some people here do take it way too far . 
  * stupidity -- no . 
  there 's a segment of the population that i would consider willfully ignorant , but that has more to do with cultural homogeneity in rural areas . 
  hillbillies are hillbillies across the world ... ours just happen to have access to the internet/facebook . 
  many americans attend college and historically we place a high value on education . 
  * ignorance -- ties in with the above point . 
  something i 've noticed is that europeans are * generally * more aware of american affairs ( which makes sense , we 're a single superpower while europe is a hodgepodge of nations ... also , this leaves out the less-educated parts of eastern europe ) than vice-versa ... however , while we are aware that we are uninformed about you , europeans tend to * severely * overestimate how much they know about the united states . 
  we also get criticized for not traveling internationally enough , but ... 
  i live as far from canada as london is from tripoli . 
  obviously mexico is closer , but the level of violence there has dissuaded some of us from vacationing in northern mexico .
