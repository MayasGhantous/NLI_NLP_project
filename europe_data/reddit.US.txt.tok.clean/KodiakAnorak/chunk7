  you do n't know how lucky you are to have an actual system of healthcare , though . 
  i 've lived in texas and oklahoma my entire life ( though i 've traveled extensively both domestically and internationally ) , and i love a lot about us -- we place a high value on inventiveness and individuality , we 're heavily-armed ( i 'm a hunter and i enjoy shooting ) , and people here are just so * open * and friendly . 
  today i had conversations with a random gas station attendant , a lady out walking her dog , and several people at the courthouse . 
  folks here are n't guarded , and i like the relaxed-yet-polite demeanor here . 
  but i envy your healthcare . 
  i envy your ease of travel to foreign nations , your love for learning/culture/history , and your progressiveness . 
  we 're going to have to find our own way -- somehow , to care for the poorest in this nation without sacrificing the vast freedoms we believe in . 
  we ca n't chart a fully european path , but neither can we continue on our current trajectory . 
  we have plenty of sun in texas and oklahoma , but we desperately need a healthcare system similar to yours . 
  my turn , my turn !, 
  pleaaaaaase ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  why would the usa want europe to be dependent on russia ? 
  not everything is the big bad american boogieman 's fault, 
  it would make it easier for us to invade someday * sinister expression *, 
  ... blackwater ? 
  really , guy ? 
  tinfoil hat much ? 
  i would assume that we 're a ) making a point , b ) who gives a shit ? 
  ukrainians can paint their own vehicles however they want , and c ) it may not be ineffective depending on the terrain . 
  do n't be so quick to criticize the `` top brass '' . 
  these decisions are made by politicians . 
  hey , remember how germany armed themselves with brooms instead of automatic weapons and you proud french came begging for fuel and ammunition because you could n't sustain operations against fucking * libya * by yourselves ? 
  i certainly do . 
  http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nato-runs-short-on-some-munitions-in-libya/2011/04/15/af3o7eld_story.html so maybe we * are * protecting europe . 
  come back and argue with me when you can actually defend yourselves . 
  you 're welcome . 
  of course ... this is why we do n't have public healthcare and our defense spending is through the roof . 
  the kind of food that explodes, 
  not going to be surprised if we start sending buffs pretty soon . 
  we 've got tons of mraps . 
  i think that the kiowas just went out of service too , so they can score some free rotary aviation assets . 
  rpgs are going to look real cute when we start sending mules and bradleys, 
  he 's german , maybe he 's just confusing them with brooms, 
  oh no , we see weird stuff all the time in austin . 
  but it 's usually pretty innocuous and people tend to be warmer and friendlier here than up north, 
  okay , see , i thought they were just doing their thing for the hell of it . 
  i did n't realize they were bugging people, 
  * shrug * i 'm huge , so i generally do n't have people `` almost knocking me over '' . 
  i also did n't know they harassed people , since i have n't been to nyc in years . 
  you 're welcome , * bro *, 
  why is this awful ? 
  being from texas , it seems like it 'd be kinda amusing . 
  i 'd probably sit there grinning like an idiot, 
   that 's the problem and the problem so many people have with the eu : this sort of petty , silly , irritating meddling in people 's lives that 's entirely unwarranted and really just the result of a bureaucracy trying to justify its own existence and budget . 
  right , because we americans have so many problems with the eu, 
  i ca n't tell if this is a norwegian the dude or if he 's like a nordic liam neeson from taken, 
  kareem abdul jabbar laughs at your pitiful arm game, 
   in oakland you need to worry ~ ~ outside the stadium . ~ ~, 
  if it was near austin , locals are mad at californians for moving in and taking up the tech jobs while they worsen traffic and drive up property prices . 
  but that 's specific to californians , not people from anywhere else . 
  mediocre , huh ? 
  did you ride eternal , shiny and chrome ? 
  weird ... no , that sounds really mexican to me . 
  i do n't associate corn or bell peppers with any mediterranean country . 
  roasted corn is definitely a mexican thing ( but is mainstream and enjoyed by everyone ) in the form of [ elotes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elote ) . 
  buuuuuut texas is closer to mexico and has strong mexican influence from first generation migrants , so we may not be as comparable as some of the northern states . 
  this is interesting , because i live pretty much across the country from you ( texas ) ... maybe not in geographical area , but we 're cultural opposites . 
  ** what foreigners get wrong about texas/oklahoma ** * pretty much anything that caters to `` cowboys '' is going to be for tourists . 
  more oklahomans than texans seem to still be directly involved in ranching ( per capita ) , but you likely would n't be out on the ranch or the farm assisting them . 
  it 's a business !, 
  * most of the tribes are very nice and are very * normal * here ... as in they live in houses , have hourly or salaried jobs , shop at grocery stores , play video games ... all that kind of stuff . 
  but if you can catch the red earth festival in okc , it 's pretty cool . 
  just try not to hurt their feelings , and do n't go in saying something like `` me smokum peace-pipe ? '', 
  they probably wo n't beat you up or anything , but they 'll think you 're an asshole . 
  * guns mostly just are n't a big deal here . 
  my grandfather was ( is ) a hunter and always had a .30 -30 marlin in a rack in the back of his beat-up ford pickup when i was a kid . 
  i think of it nostalgically . 
  it 's just a tool , not a symbol , and i think that sometimes outsiders do n't understand that about us . 
  for the most part we grew up with guns , so they do n't get the same reaction out of us that they do from foreigners . 
  it 's very `` meh '' . 
  * so that said , texans and okies may enjoy teasing you a bit about it . 
  it 'll be lighthearted , and they do n't mean anything by it . 
  i do n't really know of anyone else who is as eager to help a stranger as texans or oklahomans . 
  just look sad and lost , and somebody will probably approach you and offer to assist you . 
  * we have hillbillies . 
  they annoy me . 
  they tend to be obnoxious and abrasive . 
  you learn to ignore them . 
  machismo is definitely a thing in rural areas here ; remember , a lot of texan culture is derived from mexican . 
  * eastern oklahoma and east texas are * very * beautiful . 
  the [ talimena scenic drive ] ( http://www.talimenascenicdrive.com/ ) is n't well known , but it 's worth bringing a motorcycle and checking out when the colors turn . 
  [ beavers bend ] ( http://www.tripadvisor.com/attraction_review-g51225-d209044-reviews-beavers_bend_resort_park-broken_bow_mccurtain_county_oklahoma.html ) is another gem that very few people have ever heard of . 
  [ robbers ' cave ] ( http://www.travelok.com/listings/view.profile/id.6415 ) is regarded well . 
  those are just in oklahoma , and there are all kinds of other beautiful parks tucked away across oklahoma and texas . 
  *** my impression of ** nyc ** : dirty , crowded , people were n't nearly as rude as they 're rumored to be . 
  smells horrible . 
  lots of interesting things to see and do , but expensive . 
  we enjoyed walking around and just looking at things , taking in the neighborhoods , and talking with people . 
  ** philadelphia ** : interesting if you like revolutionary war history , but otherwise i 'd probably skip it . 
  i caught a bus to gettysburg from here , which was fascinating . 
  the liberty bell was crowded and sorta a let down from how you picture it in your mind . 
  i took some fun walking tours , though . 
  ** dc ** : i like museums , so the smithsonian was great . 
  you always feel kinda rushed , though . 
  i especially liked fdr 's memorial . 
  as you said , all the memorials are quite beautiful at night . 
  it was fun to watch people protesting over by the white house too . 
  ** dallas ** : dallas is the new york of texas . 
  people there have a reputation for being pushy and rude .
