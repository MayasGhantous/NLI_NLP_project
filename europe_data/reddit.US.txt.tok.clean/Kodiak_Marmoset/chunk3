  i was in my country 's infantry , and even after the months of training new guys would get before they arrived in the fleet , it took a solid * year * of additional instruction by us before they become an asset instead of a liability . 
  modern conflicts have shown us that a reliance on conscription , while cheaper , is a recipe for mass casualties : look at the russian experience in afghanistan and chechnya for proof . 
   the useless professional army model i 'm sorry , i do n't quite understand you . 
  are you suggesting that a professional standing army is useless ? 
  as in , professional soldiers are less capable than conscripts ? 
  because that 's laughably wrong . 
  lenin also created the * cheka * and oversaw the red terror . 
  he was n't a progressive whose good works were ruined by stalin . 
   someone calling their son mark marks ... [ did someone say `` marky mark '' ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=marky+mark&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmiql7b76skxgivgxcsch32kqw9&amp;biw=984&amp;bih=744#imgrc=_ ), 
  that sounds more like the result of good canadian pr , honestly . 
  see an asshole with a canadian flag patch ? 
  canadians * ca n't * be rude , they 're obviously americans trying to hide . 
  you may not have noticed , but americans do n't take well to what they consider `` treachery '' : pearl harbor and 9/11 both had relatively low casualties ( in the grand scheme ) but the american people were howling for blood after each of them . 
  in an already-hot war with russia , who is both a historic foe * and * just dropped a nuke on american troops ? 
  forget it . 
  americans are too warlike to just roll over like that . 
  not against black bears , if you 're ever in north america . 
  brown and grizzly bears most often attack people because they get angry , so playing dead will usually make them go away after gnawing on you for a while . 
  black bears attack people * for food * , so playing dead will just get you eaten . 
  if you 're talking about military graffiti the answer is always `` dicks '' . 
  but you have to admit that choosing the tower of babel as a symbol is a bit defeatist , considering how that story ended . 
  eagles and flags are kickass . 
  we also have a sweet buffalo , did you miss that ? 
  i do n't believe it 's unique , i 've seen fringe like that in town halls as well . 
  it 's certainly not on flags that are meant to be flown on a normal pole , just carried on a little guidon pole like in the picture . 
  i think it may be a governmental thing . 
  as a serious reply , i 'm not sure * exactly * what the fringe is for , but i 've seen them on unit flags before : each unit generally has its special unit banner which lists the battles and glories its won , and a paired stars-and-stripes . 
  they 're displayed together , in the foyer of the command building , so that their staves cross . 
  the national flag is often dressier than normal , because it 's only ever trotted out for ceremonies . 
  is there something wrong with wanting your flag to look fabulous when traveling ? 
  that 's multicam , it 's excellent in wooded and grassy terrain . 
   when newly-powerful morons took a completely destroyed and looted europe we looted europe ? 
  because the marshall plan sank the equivalent of ~ 100 billion dollars into rebuilding europe . 
   that nato ` alliance ' seems more like it 's just some us protection-racket . 
  is that why the us has been trying to get other nato members to increase their military spending so the us can shift more of its focus to the pacific ? 
  encouraging others to be more able to defend themselves without you is a very odd `` protection racket '' . 
   rabid hypermilitary corporocracy ... police-state . 
  wow , so many meaningless buzzwords . 
   they had to train with broomsticks and imaginery vehicules recently come on man , that was just a joke by a single non-combat crew that somehow exploded in the news . 
  [ because this . 
  to be fair , the only french city i 've been to is marseilles , but the people there * were * the rudest and most impolite people i 've ever met in europe . 
  i had a wonderful time everywhere else , but i could n't leave france fast enough . 
  it 's ours now , pops . 
  those vertical stripes are so slimming . 
  do people live above those shops ? 
  that 's why the us has a balance between the house of representatives , where the number of representatives are proportional to each state 's population , and the senate , where each state regardless of size has two senators ( and is more powerful ) . 
  that 's precisely so large populous states ca n't simply overrule smaller ones . 
  battlecruisers and battleships like in your first picture were designed to cruise within visual range of the enemy ships and pummel each other with cannons . 
  wwii , especially the pacific theater , showed that no matter how much armor you put on a battleship , or how many cannons it carried , cheap aluminum aircraft can destroy it before your mighty battleship can ever see the enemy fleet . 
  that shifted naval development more towards supporting and countering aircraft ( and submarines ) . 
  with the advent of guided long-range missiles , cannons have become relegated to close-defense role ; in essence a weapon of last resort . 
  we have lots of b-52s parked in storage in the desert . 
  one of our b-52s was recently in an accident , and they deemed it cheaper to resurrect a replacement plane than to repair the damaged one . 
   elg does this mean `` elk '' ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.nps.gov/features/yell/slidefile/mammals/elk/images/00305.jpg ) is what we refer to as an `` elk '' in north america . 
  what do you norwegians call it ? 
  i did misread that , apologies . 
  terrorists were using it in iraq a decade ago , it 's nowhere close to being `` the pinnacle '' of any technology . 
  if i came across as overly condescending , i apologize . 
  that was n't my intention . 
  i 've seen a lot of posts similar to yours from people pushing a certain agenda , and wanted to nip it in the bud . 
  a cursory wikipedia search can be a dangerous thing , because only a tiny bit of knowledge about a subject can lead to misinformation . 
  for example , that `` delayed fuze '' you edited into your first post is a * safety feature * : it detonates the missile in midair if it fails to hit its target . 
  but not knowing that , and seeing `` delayed fuze '' , it puts all sorts of evil associations into your head . 
  you 're a perfect example of someone who argues about a subject despite ignorance of it . 
  you even admit you do n't know anything other than what is on wikipedia . 
  anti-aircraft missiles , even ones with impact fuses , are not designed to hit a target and stick inside it before detonating minutes later . 
  whether they detonate on impact , or milliseconds afterwards is immaterial in this conversation . 
  stingers are heat-seeking missiles . 
  they lock on to , and ram the engine of their target . 
  if that airliner had been hit by a stinger , even one that failed to detonate , * the pilots would have noticed * . 
  they would have said something over the radio , they would have immediately turned around for an emergency landing , they would have done literally * anything * except continue climbing as if they had no idea what had happened . 
   maybe it was shot while the plane was climbing , penetrated in the hull , and waited for the correct height . 
  that 's not how missiles work . 
  you should visit / r/snackexchange . 
  those are n't nearly as common as movies would lead you to believe . 
  outside of places like new york city or los angeles , i 've never even seen one . 
  the * japanese * were the ones that dragged the us into wwii , unless you 're trying to say that the british bombed pearl harbor in what would have been the greatest false-flag attack in history . 
  he 's not a socialist , he 's a full-blown communist . 
  you 're trying to reason with a brick wall . 
  that 's a very brave man . 
  foolish , but very brave . 
  show us on the doll where the mean american touched you , szkwarek . 
  you 're from bulgaria ? 
  that 's awfully rough talk from a country that rolled right over for the nazis , and then rolled right over for the soviets . 
  i 've never seen a dog learn that trick so fast . 
  what happened to `` banter '' , and mocking people who get so incredibly butthurt and offended over a little gentle ribbing ? 
  my car has a manual transmission , so i use my parking brake . 
  automatic transmissions just put it into `` drive '' and go , hills do n't bother them in the slightest . 
  manual transmissions used to be clearly superior , but modern automatic or even semi-auto transmissions have advanced to the point that any advantage a manual transmission had in the past is gone . 
  even formula one gave up manual clutches in the 90 's . 
  i know europeans love to live in the past , but let me extend you a formal invitation to the 21 ^ st century . 
  there may have been something messed up in the translation to german , but he did n't go into crime to fund his treatment ; he got into crime to provide financial stability for his family after he was dead . 
  but if you 're just trying to circlejerk , carry on . 
  `` weapon of mass destruction '' means nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons . 
  it has nothing to do with yield or size , but the nature of the weapon itself . 
  [ war in darfur ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_in_darfur ) the u.n. response was pathetic , and `` after the fact '' ; they sat on their hands for the majority of the conflict because the sudanese government did n't want them to intervene . 
  i agree that the u.n. security council should be ashamed of its inaction , but the conflict in sudan had upwards of half-a-million civilian deaths . 
  syria ca n't compare to that , and i pray that it never does .
