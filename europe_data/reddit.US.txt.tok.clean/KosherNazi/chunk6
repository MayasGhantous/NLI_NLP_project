  again in 2003 , france and germany [ colluded to escape sgp rules which would have enforced fines and further austerity ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/27/qanda.business ) on their economies , knowing that what was needed was deficit-fueled growth , not adherence to arbitrary accounting rules . 
  the french pm at the time , raffarin , even said something to the effect of `` my first priority is jobs , and not the math some government or other far away wishes to trifle us with . '' yet now , when greece is the one in need of assistance , they 're given `` bailouts '' that primarily bail out french and german banks , they get limited debt forgiveness , but only of its tied to * even more * austerity , and they get an insistince that greece run a primary surplus -- something germany was saying was impossible in the midst of its own recession just a decade ago !, 
  maybe the average german just does n't remember these events , but this is why many people are hating on germany . 
   sorry , wrong . 
   the stability-focused central bank was france 's concession to germany and similarly minded northern countries ( netherlands etc. 
  ) , it 's what they got in return for there being no fiscal enforcement . 
   france blocked any sort of strict fiscal rule enforcement and that 's why we got the maastricht criteria , the weak-sauce rules that were wholly lacklustre in a number of ways , even if followed . 
  spain , for example , did follow them and got an enormous problem with private debt and a huge bubble , the debt ended up being nationalised during the financial crisis . 
   this process is exactly how europe works , there is a compromise and both sides make concessions . 
  the northern concession was the lack of fiscal rule enforcement , the southern concession was the stability-oriented central bank . 
  it could n't be further away from a german imposition . 
  you 're being pedantic . 
  how is `` both sides make concessions '' wholly different from `` germany imposed its conditions for joining '' ? 
  the end result is the same , germany got an emu that would allow it to use europe as a dumping ground for its exports . 
   actually , germany was doing very bad economically after around 1998 ( start of the euro ) and introduced these reforms to spur economic activity and get out of the slump . 
  this was when germany was named ` the sick man of europe ' and everyone else was growing massively , back when economists predicted spain would overtake germany in gdp in some years . 
   0 points for your lack of historical context knowledge . 
  it was never about hurting other european countries , it was about getting out of economic slump . 
  ... and germany got out of the slump with the hartz reforms , giving them [ a decade of wage stagnation ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=germanywaggro&amp;d1=20070101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;url2=/united-states/wage-growth&amp;title=false&amp;h=300&amp;w=600&amp;ref=/germany/wage-growth ) . 
  they realized they could no longer manipulate their currency to boost export growth , so something else had to change -- might as well be labor , right ? 
   in reality the maastricht criteria allow 3 % budget deficits , not perpetual surplus . 
  germany ( and the ec , and the imf ) has literally been telling greece it needs to run a primary surplus . 
  how else do you think they 're going to pay back all those loans ? 
   also , back then the centre-left government of germany teamed up with france to run higher than allowed budget deficits without being punished , they succeeded . 
   0 points for faulty history : germany actually weakened budget rules back then , they did not demand strict discipline . 
  yes , and they 've apparently forgotten that deficit spending is the appropriate response to a depression , not enormous , unpayable loans . 
   actually , this is exactly my field of expertise . 
  i studied european law and politics . 
  what did you do , read blogs about it from america ? 
  congratulations , your arrogance and ability to [ consistently get it wrong ] ( http://i.imgur.com/szkag6k.jpg ) qualify you for a job at the imf !, 
  with the euro , you faced the opposite problem -- the death of domestic businesses because they could not compete with the artificially cheap imports from northern europe . 
  this will simply reverse that trend . 
  painful , sure , but with a terminus this time -- something not found with the euro . 
  as for energy , greece will soon be a major energy transfer hub , with new pipelines bringing gas from russia , the caucasus , and iran , and they 'll be able to earn a good deal of hard currency from transfer fees . 
  greece has also recently settled seafloor energy deposit borders with it 's mediterranean neighbors , and there are significant gas deposits off its southern and southwestern coast . 
  this , combined with tourism , and a new re-invigorated domestic economy now that it does n't have to compete with cheap german imports , will put the greek people back to work and create real economic growth . 
  absolutely . 
  if greece stays in the euro ( and the current troika mindset does n't change ) , greece 's economy will continue to fester . 
  staying in is basically a challenge to greece that if it wants to flourish economically , it must out-compete northern economies like germany for the limited pool of euros ( every country ca n't run a surplus of euros , after all ... for one to run a surplus another must , by definition , run a deficit ) -- this is impossible !, 
  there is nothing left for greece in the euro but pain . 
  default is not ideal , but with a return to the drachma greece has a real option for growth and a renewed ability to attract foreign investment . 
  fill greek beaches with tourists again -- europe would flock to greece for cheap holidays ( and americans , and russians ... ) . 
  return to the drachma would see immediate devaluation of the currency , but this would quickly reverse once the world saw that greece was now able to spend its way back to employment using * sovereign * debt , debt which it does not have to borrow from foreign creditors , to match idle labor with idle resources to create real economic growth . 
  the euro is a straightjacket which offers * no * future for greece ( at least until european federalization ) ... the drachma offers a path to prosperity . 
  to me , there is only one realistic option left for the greek people . 
  unfortunately , syriza has thrown this momentous ( and confusing ) decision back to the greek people , displaying an enormous lack of leadership , and likely dooming the greek people to austerity , as most greeks are scared and will vote to keep `` the devil they know . '', 
  the foundations of the emu are based on bundesbank culture and `` fiscal discipline '' , which prizes price stability over all else , including unemployment and economic growth . 
  [ these were literally the conditions germany imposed upon the emu in its formation . 
  ] ( http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=27168 ) what 's so ridiculous about this , though , is that germany grew its economy throughout the latter half of the century by expanding its export market . 
  under a single currency , what 's going to happen if germany continues to insist on running euro-denominated surpluses ? 
  the rest of the eurozone * must * run deficits , it 's basic accounting . 
  in pursuit of this goal , germany even went so far as to push down domestic wage growth with all sorts of bullshit like `` minijobs '' to further expand their export market at the expense of european partners . 
  and in the midst of all this , they have the gaul to demand * everyone else * to run surpluses !, 
  it 's insanity on a grand scale . 
  with all due respect , your interpretation of `` everyone shares equally in the administration of the emu '' is woefully na\u00efve and completely ignores the enormous influence of the german economy both before and after entry to the emu . 
  uhh ... austerity was not the only tool they had . 
  that fact is literally the basis of the last 7 years of political dissent across the eurozone . 
  the only thing stopping the troika from ending this madness was germany 's insistence of the `` moral hazard '' of doing so , while ignoring the moral implications of letting an entire generation of greeks stew in 60 % + unemployment and a 25 % contraction in gdp . 
  and of course , the germans apparently have no memory of the london debt agreement , which forgave enormous postwar german debts and tied further payments to export earnings , ensuring he debts could be paid in a sustainable fashion without killing domestic growth . 
  nobody here has any fucking idea what they 're talking about , you 're all just repeating the same old ignorant platitudes that let you justify your predetermined views of what is `` right '' . 
  literally anything is better than a continuation of the last 7 years ... 
  yet you just voted for more of the same . 
  even with the enormous lack of leadership syriza has demonstrated , it blows my mind that you would choose more austerity when given the choice . 
  no vision ? 
  they 're literally the only legitimate party to envision any path for greece that * does n't * involve greeks acting as indentured servants for the next 20 years . 
  i agree they lack leadership and are full of populist rhetoric , but the other guys are full of that too , while offering no alternative to the economic annihilation of the last 7 years . 
  literally anything is better than more austerity , and you took your one opportunity to choose a different path and said `` no '' . 
  it blows my mind . 
   both claims are simply not true . 
  nether is the surplus this high , nor does it come from these countries . 
  [ your current accounts surplus has been that high since late 2011 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yxqzcop.jpg ) ( see the [ ec report from 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/documents/2014-03-05_in-depth_reviews_communication_en.pdf ) , pg 13 ) , and germany is the [ top exporter for each of those nations ] ( https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/ita/ ) . 
  the share was even higher before their economies began to collapse . 
  but more to the point , the eurozone has created a pyramid , with germany and other northern states at the top and greece/italy/spain at the bottom . 
  all trade balances flow from these weak debtor nations to stronger creditor nations . 
  their economies can not compete with artificially cheap german exports . 
  and if they still had their own currencies , they would n't have to . 
   you also may want to explain how `` germany '' ( whoever that is ) keeps `` its domestic wages artificially low '' . 
  when germany joined the emu , it could no longer manipulate its exchange rate to ensure a strong export market , so it looked for other variables to manipulate -- enter labor . 
  the hartz reforms created bullshit like `` minijobs '' , which allowed employers to hire people without paying any benefits . 
  german wage growth has been [ abysmal over the last decade ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=germanywaggro&amp;d1=20070101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;url2=/united-states/wage-growth&amp;title=false&amp;h=300&amp;w=600&amp;ref=/germany/wage-growth ) , struggling to average 1 % annually . 
   the `` zero employment growth '' is much less worrisome when you realize that germany is approaching full employment . 
  i guess if you define `` full employment '' as `` 20 % holding a minijob '' , sure . 
  why ? 
  are you conservative/nationalist ? 
  not critiquing , just curious . 
  but you guys are n't even investing them in germany !, 
  you 're hoarding them . 
  your external surplus is near 8 % , draining other member states of euros , and your imports are only half that amount . 
  yet you suffer from years of wage stagnation , chronically underfunded infrastructure investment , and zero employment growth . 
  i agree that a federated europe would have been a better choice , and i completely empathize with how powerless it must feel to think of giving money to people who can spend it without recourse , but the alternatives are much worse . 
  instead of pushing for an outcome that could see the partial dissolution of the eurozone and the eu , push for one that gives more oversight of where your money goes -- federation . 
  a greek exit of the eurozone seems almost inevitable now , and if it does , german exports to greece will evaporate . 
  if spain and italy go , [ so to does the engine that has been driving german growth since the eu 's inception ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yxqzcop.jpg ) . 
  the economic consequences are dire , but the social consequences of a re-fractured europe are even more severe , especially considering the emerging threats on europe 's borders . 
  i agree in theory . 
  however , the social consequences of the failure of the eurozone , or the eu as a whole , will be catastrophic . 
  it will take decades for an attempt to be made again , and not before nationalist parties gain even more influence in the aftermath . 
  my analogy breaks down by design , as a way to illustrate the flaws inherent in the eu , which has a monetary union without a fiscal union . 
  by removing the power of individual european nations to control their monetary policy , and simultaneously demanding that they adhere to strict fiscal controls , you force greece into a catastrophe . 
  greece will never out-compete germany , yet this is essentially what is being asked of them ( and italy , and spain ) .
