  america has had very little to actually say on the matter . 
  as beyond stating its opinion generally the us leaves eu matters to the eu . 
  iraq was a voluntary commitment by the european countries that participated . 
  it had nothing to do with nato . 
  even then the `` fallout '' for not supporting the us , was hilariously minimal . 
  unless you think insults from american right wing pundits are some sort of coercion . 
  also you have failed to provide a good example of nato being used against europe . 
  how is nato used against europe ? 
  i 'm curious as well . 
  i highly doubt that obama just decided to come over . 
  i 'm imagining some one in the uk government invited him . 
  i find it interesting that obama just came out and said the us does not have that much interest in ukraine . 
  not that it has any truth in the first place , but it highlights how ridiculous that kremlin conspiracy is that the us started the crises . 
  you do realize that under sofa agreements if germany wants americans troops to leave they can make them ? 
  ever wonder why there are no american bases in france ? 
  because the french told us to leave when they left nato , and big , bad , evil , imperial america ... . left when we were told to . 
  our troops are in your countries by the consent of your own governments . 
  not as some ridiculous imperialism conspiracy theory . 
  i gurantee you that american troops and germans who work at us instalations put way more into the economy then what any of those cost . 
  surely this thread will be a haven of rational discussion !, 
  our defense spending already is being cut , as i said in the original post its at about 3.5 percent of gdp right now , and is currently in process of being cut a further half percent by the close of the decade . 
  even if the us gutted it defense spending it would not `` obliterate '' the deficit . 
  it might slow down its growth temporarily , but [ entitlement spending is going to consume all federal revenue by mid century at the earliest ] ( http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/10/federal-spending-by-the-numbers-2012 ) . 
  even now it already accounts for 60 percent of all federal spending . 
  the defense budget consumes 20 % and is still declining . 
  for education the us does not need to spend more money . 
  we have been throwing money at the problem and it has not worked . 
  [ only four countries spend more money per capita on students , austria , luxembourg , norway and switzerland . 
  ] ( http://www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2014_eag-2014-en#page4 ) while it is true that these countries do better in education , so does virtually every other country on the list , and they spend less money that the us does per capita . 
  teacher pay is not the issue either . 
  [ teachers in the us make the 6th most globally behind germany , luxemburg , south africa , switzerland and denmark . ], 
  ( http://educationbythenumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/screen-shot-2014-03-07-at-10.53.48-am1.png ) . 
  note that both finland and south korea which are generally regarded as having two of the best education systems in the world are 17th and 21st respectively . 
  the issue with us education is not the amount of money , but how that money is spent . 
  drastic cuts to the defense budget will leave the us unable to fulfill its security obligations in europe and especially asia . 
  while giving no long or short term gain to the us , and could potentially detabilize [ what is the most peaceful period in human history ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/12/the_world_is_not_falling_apart_the_trend_lines_reveal_an_increasingly_peaceful.html ) . 
  right , but the point is the us can afford to spend that much . 
  it does not hurt us economically . 
  pure dollar figures do n't matter , its how much of the economy the spending takes up . 
  the issue for the us going forward will be funding our entitlements , as these will consume virtually all the federal budget by mid-century or earlier . 
  we could zero out our defense budget and it would not put a dent in it . 
  we used to spend significantly more money on defense during the cold war . 
  if you think the us is spending to much money on defense you need to look at defense spending and realize that the us has cut it by half or more since the end of the cold war . 
  it reached 10 % of gdp during the korean war for example . 
  the us is on course to have only spent less money on defense in the periods before wwi when we were isolationist . 
  the us has no need to further cut its defense spending . 
  we actually do n't . 
  we are spending 3.5 percent of our gpd right now , and will prolly be spending around 3 percent by the close of the decade . 
  our economy is just so large it looks like we spend way to much money on defense . 
  you wont find a sane economist that says 3-3 .8 percent of gpd is unhealthy for an economy . 
  mmmmm ... can you smell freedom 's freedom ? 
  yes , i ment the city . 
  yeah , that is why it so hard to pin down what benefits americans have , since most of it is provided privately instead of publicly . 
  it also leads to huge disparities in things like vacation time . 
  i have friends who have six weeks off a year , and others who barley have two . 
  75k does wonders almost anywhere in the us outside of probably new york and some parts of california . 
  to be fair , especially in ww1 , the reason we entered those conflicts so late was because of all the german ancestry in the states . 
  kasich , bush , and rubio are all for strengthening nato and european ties . 
  none of them are economic protectionistists either . 
  do n't confuse republican disdain for the european social system as disdain for europe . 
  when have we thrown you under the bus ? 
  you are missing the cultural realities of the special relationship . 
  in terms of legal and governmental systems the us and the uk are very similar ( common law system ) . 
  the uk has by any measurement the most cultural and societal influence on the us of any country in the world . 
  there is also a history of very close relationships between us and uk heads of state ( clinton/blair , thatcher/reagan etc ) . 
  the only country in the world that has a higher positive rating among americans is canada , and among countries that americans say they would go to war for , the uk is always near or at the top of the list . 
  there is also massive collaboration between the defence and intelligence agencies of the two countries , and may actually be the largest collaboration in modern history . 
  even in mannerisms americans treat the uk as special . 
  i.e if your are flying to europe it 's common to say : `` i 'm going to britain/u . k then onto europe . '', 
  this is not even going into economics where the amount of trade between the two countries is staggering considering the size of the uk . 
  in terms of help , it 's more of a matter of the uk not asking for help , than the us not providing it . 
  no it does not at all . 
  i do n't know why this subreddit is obssessed with this . 
  the us does not see the eu as a rival . 
  we want a strong unified europe with a strong military and economy . 
  we are extremely similar culturally compared to the rest of the world . 
  there are other interpretations of ir besides realism . 
  the us takes a liberal stance in our approach to europe . 
  i swear i could start a political party in almost any european country , and get 5-10 percent of the electorate by just blaming everything on the us . 
  europe : `` america is trying to make europe weak !, 
  they do n't want the eu as a rival ! '', 
  america : `` hey guys , you should stick together and not let this eu thing fail . '', 
  europe : `` america is trying to make us weak !, 
  they are trying to keep the uk in the eu ! '', 
  it depends , socially yes they are different , but on foreign policy and economics the parties are very similar . 
  these might be something that could help you answer your questions .

  right ... 
  the dollar figure does not matter because the eu is not a unified military . 
  there is no unified command or anything close to a nato like organizational structure . 
  each country has to maintain their own respective armed forces so there is a ton of redundancy which reduces total force capacity . 
  the eu also faces the same issue that the us does in that its costs much more to equip and train most of its forces than say russia or china . 
  also the eu is most certainly not capable of projecting power outside of europe on any meaningful scale without having to lean on the american logistical network ( see libya or the french intervention in mali ) . 
  also i included the uk in the post not just the us . 
  i put `` dependency '' in quotes , because i am extremely suspicious of anyone who says that europe is dependent on the us for anything . 
  europe and the us work together because of strong mutual interest and shared values . 
  not some machiavellian plan by the us to keep europe `` down '' . 
  even in a real politik sense the us * wants * a strong , stable eu with a strong military . 
  hence why the us is always asking european countries to increase defense spending . 
  if european powers want to break this `` dependency '' on the us , they need to increase defense spending .
