  you can see it at 2:40, 
  you can spend whatever and get windows of any type . 
  a lot depends on the age of the home and the climate the home is in . 
  flimsy how ? 
  most american homes are just [ wooden frames ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cl6evdr.jpg ) with drywall interior and brick/stone/whatever exterior . 
  how else would you do it ? 
  i thought it was canadian for the longest time . 
  its depends who . 
  ww2 was pretty profitable for the us, 
  you 're the third person on / r/europe i 've met from raleigh . 
  i do actually !, 
  there 's a meadery near me that makes some great stuff . 
  usually go through a bottle or two a month . 
  thanks !, 
  i 've seen plenty of strongbow . 
  might have to look around at some of the larger bottle shops to find some good international brands then . 
  might not be able to get anything decent on tap :( but i 'm always willing to try new stuff especially if it 's recommended . 
  at least our tourists have options !, 
  lmao wow that 's kinda terrifying . 
  still is a rough town with plenty of gang violence . 
  [ here 's some stats . 
  it 's gotten better but still has a ways to go . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_washington,_d.c . ), 
  [ ranks pretty well ] ( http://www.beeradvocate.com/lists/top/ ) . 
  we have over 4,000 breweries so i 'm sure someone will find something they like . 
  cider was never really big here but it 's [ starting to take off ] ( http://www.ciderguide.com/cider-maps/united-states/ ) . 
  give it a few more years  personally i 'm starting to find myself ordering cider more over beer when i 'm out . 
  any european brands to recommend ? 
  you guys should look into automation . 
  it 's amazing how well planes hold up . 
  i would n't be surprised if there was still stuff in the air from the 70 's . 
  well you guys should advertise other places more !, 
  or build more cities !, 
  wow now that you mention it i ca n't think of a capital city that is n't hated by the locals . 
  ever since they lightened up on micro brew laws there has been an explosion of amazing beer across the country . 
  it has truly become a beer lovers paradise . 
  in my home town they just opened up a place with over 350 beers on tap . 
  welcome to the club montenegro , 
  well basketball is a lot more popular outside of the us than i would 've thought . 
  we beat them in the last world cup . 
  it is our right . 
  pretty new plane for something to have gone wrong :( hope everything works out ok . 
  great point . 
  there 's the problem when comparing international metrics that a lot of people seem to overlook . 
  for us metrics from the bureau of labor statistics they [ define unemployed as ] ( http://www.bls.gov/bls/faqs.htm ) :  * all persons who had no employment during the reference week * were available for work , except for temporary illness * made specific efforts to find employment some time during the 4 week-period ending with the reference week . 
  * persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed . 
  eurostat ( op 's source ) on the other hand [ defines unemployment as ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/glossary:unemployment ) :  * someone aged 15 to 74 ( in italy , spain , the united kingdom , iceland , norway : 16 to 74 years ) ; * without work during the reference week ; * available to start work within the next two weeks ( or has already found a job to start within the next three months ) ; * actively having sought employment at some time during the last four weeks . 
  so i think it 's fair to consider these different sampling methods close enough to have a not insignificant similarity . 
  sure , but you can [ look at almost any state with a decent population at county level ] ( http://data.bls.gov/map/maptoolservlet?survey=la&amp;map=county&amp;seasonal=u ) and it still does n't come out to as bad as spain . 
  mississippi for example only has a few counties near spain level . 
  thank you for the serious response . 
  [ there actually are n't ] ( http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm ) . 
  do n't take this the wrong way , but can someone explain to me how spain is a functioning country ? 
  slowed significantly . 
  enough so that they devalued the yuan and nearly killed the shanghai composite . 
  easy mistake . 
  we could send [ william hung ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ts5tvbyjsc ), 
  that would actually be kinda cool . 
  `` tell her she has n't emptied my trash all week ! '', 
  does n't snow more than a day a year here in the south . 
  for fucks sake canada . 
  my top two are tartu and tallinn . 
  got ta say , i 'm surprised . 
  raleigh !, 
  im curious to know what your parameters were . 
  i work with a team of ukrainians that my company out sources to . 
  all great guys !, 
  expensive !, 
  good luck !, 
  i 'm sure you 'll love it !, 
  dammit . 
  i love danish pastries too . 
  wait in line , dad . 
  does n't exist . 
  may i ask where ? 
  he 's so dreamy ... 
  ohhhhhhh next to st petersburg ? 
  yes . 
  and do n't even get me started on `` aluminum '' !, 
  it does n't really matter when the us military is larger than all 4 of them combined . 
  i use my card for literally everything . 
  i have n't carried cash in years . 
  when i was traveling abroad i was amazed at how many countries still use cash . 
  wow i 've actually never seen one of those before . 
  i myself have a hand brake . 
  parking break pedals ? 
  i have no idea what you could be referring to . 
  when an accusation like that is made it needs to be taken seriously every time . 
  since they just called him up front to talk instead of sending in the cops to pull him out it sounds like they thought the lady was crazy themselves . 
  this is so stupid what the fuck ? 
  soon to be two carriers are least . 
  still surprised you guys did n't go with a nuclear power source . 
  you 're nuts if you think the typhoon can compete with the f-22 . 
  if anything , it * might * have a chance at very close range , but the f-22 is designed to dominate the sky at very long range before you even know they 're there . 
  i do n't know why they just do n't get it over with . 
  it 's like a sitcom . 
  back in the good ole days you just needed a drivers license or general id to get into canada :(, 
  those are n't eu passports . 
  those are individual country passports with eu written on them . 
  i 'd rather play hockey in canada than get beheaded in mexico . 
  when the eu starts distributing official eu passports and eu countries no longer have their own then we can talk .
