  education , or lack thereof , is n't the issue here . 
  boston marathon , underwear bomber , shoe bomber , san bernardino . 
  germany and japan were also very successful and industrial countries with a history of good work ethics . 
  none of the middle east can compare . 
  it 's hard to fix a country that does n't want to fix itself ; that has no history of exceptionalisn to relate to strive to . 
  with the declining yuan and chinese growth on the slow down i do n't see what you mean by the us losing it 's role as world police . 
  as long as europe and other countries continue to use us to supplement their military we will always be world police for better or worse . 
  unfortunately true , presentation has a huge psychological effect on the perceived quality of the food . 
  its like how teeth are naturally yellowish but everyone expects them to be pure white . 
  that 's why we 're so fat . 
  assholes managed to make garbage food cheap and delicious :(, 
  other than pesticides can you source any regulation differences ? 
  i always thought we were pretty much on par . 
  keep up the good work !, 
  there are a * lot * of variables that can impact food quality in the us , what state you 're in , price of that particular food , store bought or at a restaurant . 
  in my experience you can get anything from anywhere on the scale of quality . 
  in the us , german tourists tend to wander out into the mojave and die ... 
  i would assume soccer hooligans . 
  louis jones jr retired from the military with good standing . 
  looks like he fought in the gulf war . 
  my stat was regarding active military personnel . 
  i do n't know a whole lot about adxf to be honest . 
  only that it 's probably one of the most secure prisons in the world and houses some pretty big names . 
  i know i would n't want to be locked up there that 's for sure . 
  [ i think this is the footage you 're talking about ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paaabru9zwc ) . 
  i see dark spots but i thought that was just debris . 
  it 's hard to tell compared with how bright the first pic is . 
  only three federal inmates have been executed since 1988 . 
  usually terrorism stuff like the boston bombing or the oklahoma city bombing . 
  a member of the military has n't been executed since 1961 . 
  you have to do something really serious to even be considered for death row let alone being held by the feds instead of a state . 
  i 've always found that most federal inmates get life over capital punishment which is why places like [ adx florence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adx_florence ) exist . 
  that depends entirely on the state . 
  19 states have already abolished it and the ones that still have it rarely use it . 
  my own state has n't executed anyone since 2006 . 
  texas by itself though is pretty crazy with how many people they execute ... 
  people do n't like obama . 
  he 's considered a slightly below average president who made a lot of promises then kinda fell flat . 
  trump is so popular because he 's not the establishment . 
  not too much more than that . 
  all the other gop candidates are hated by most of the republican voters . 
  i 'm far from a fan of our prison system but i think it 's probably just right for guys like this . 
  ~ ~ i 'm surprised the runways/tarmac seem so intact compared to everything else . ~ ~ [ here 's a much brighter picture with much better detail and lighting . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jdcsicy.jpg ) [ ^ ^ google ^ ^ maps ^ ^ link ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/donetsk+international+airport/@48.0709025,37.7480282,987m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x40e084b5ea939fed:0x490282f2b67e87be!6m1!1e1 ), 
  we are currently at ~ 4.9 with canada at ~ 7.3 and rising . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/canada/unemployment-rate ), 
  it 's all about the money . 
  canada relies a lot on imports so overall cost of living in virtually all industries is a lot higher and that adds up quick . 
  a young canadian programmer can do far better in the us than anywhere in canada . 
  like / u/serupael said , with `` several neck injuries '' :p, 
  apparently like this http://i.imgur.com/w212ts8.jpg where the lights are nearly above the `` stop line '' instead of on the other side of the intersection . 
  well i mean yea you can get sick like that , but i mean people think you get viruses like the cold and the flu just by * being * cold . 
  especially with the weak cad right now, 
  yea , if they did n't sell they would end up just like rim i think and the whole company would be at risk . 
  no , i 've never said it would be crucial or critical . 
  like you said raw telemetry and sensors are far more beneficial . 
  my argument is simply that cameras serve a much greater purpose than simply pr  . 
  when you 're dealing with rockets it makes no sense to not utilize every possible data point for analysis . 
  as far as nasa and spacex is concerned they put cameras on everything they launch . 
  [ a quick google found this article talking about the benefits of an on board camera system ] ( http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/cameras-at-sls-booster-test-will-provide-critical-data-for-rockets-first-flight.html ), 
  same way we livestream from the iss and all the streaming data from satellites and probes . 
  not just pr . 
  if something goes wrong they have a video to look for clues . 
  nasa has dozens of cameras on the ground and on their rockets just for analysis . 
  bbq does not involve an open flame . 
  it 's essentially burying the meat in coals for hours if not days . 
  carolina bbq best bbq !, 
  i would n't say they 're confusing except for the giant multi lane ones . 
  most are just you 're typical 3/4 exit one lane roundabout . 
  if it has upside down bits i go with spanish . 
  we 're allies dude . 
  that 's what allies do . 
  we comment on brexit just as your government does about trump . 
  yea , if at any time a state is allowed to leave the union , the federation has failed entirely . 
  states rights and independence is a very big deal . 
  that actually makes a lot of sense . 
  no one says laser it 's laser . 
  my whole life is a lie !, 
  i believe the dakotas were originally settled by germans and russians so yes probably . 
  although with todays tech it practically is like playing a video game !, 
  i 've never heard of the draft thing before but there are people who think being cold means you 'll get sick . 
  i hope so !, 
  election is still far off so a lot can change in these coming months . 
  at this point i would n't be so sure . 
  he 's polling extremely well . 
  but bins are great !, 
  you can even automate pickup with robot arms on the garbage trucks !, 
  i want to go to finland and just make fins feel awkward now . 
  asia pacific , middle east and africa combined only make up a little over 25 % of mcdonalds revenue . 
  europe is ~ 36 % and na is ~ 33 %, 
  i do n't know . 
  all that taxation without representation was a pretty dick move . 
  burgers , apparently . 
  by 1st and 2nd largest do you mean by class ? 
  they look pretty bad ass too . 
  because all their ships are on fire ? 
  well shit i need to go there too . 
  this is such a great picture . 
  i really want to go to portugal now . 
  i 'm super excited for energy weapons .
