  i ca n't wait to see how the laser cannon trials go . 
   what 's a mile or two either way ? 
  well depending on the yield , quite a lot :p, 
  that 's why we have those war games . 
  this way we can identify what we need to fix . 
  if nothing was `` sunk '' during that time it just means we 're not preparing hard enough . 
  subs are n't easy to find for any country . 
  that 's the point of a sub . 
  i knew we had a lot of subs but damn !, 
  that looks so surreal . 
  like a cruise ship was left on the moon . 
  i forgot all about that !, 
  i wonder how it got in but not out . 
  :p catobar is the system used where the plane attaches to a track on the runway . 
  the track acts as a catapult to fling the plane off the side since the runway is too short to take off traditionally . 
  britain is sticking with vtol aircraft for this carrier so they do n't need to worry about take off and landing distance . 
  yea , i was n't aware the charles de gaulle was n't considered a super carrier . 
  boy , when you look at [ the list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supercarrier#supercarriers_in_service ) of global super carriers in service . 
  i always thought russia at least still had something operational . 
  cool !, 
  welcome back to the super carrier club !, 
  interesting that they chose to have two control towers . 
  i was also surprised to see it does n't use nuclear propulsion or a catobar launch system but i guess in the end those would 've drove costs up drastically . 
  is britain building carriers again ? 
  if so are they like ours or more like your old ones with the little ramps . 
  are any of your lakes deep enough ? 
  of course it will be . 
  it 'll be full of new yorkers !, 
  the new [ london one ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01584/embassy_1584664c.jpg ) is pretty crazy . 
  my person favorite of [ all our embasies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_diplomatic_missions_of_the_united_states ) is the one in [ dublin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/embassy_of_the_united_states_in_dublin ) . 
  edit : apparently we 're looking to build a new embassy in dublin :(, 
  looks like something out of mirror 's edge !, 
  beautiful !, 
  [ it varies on a state by state basis ] ( https://www.cars.com/articles/2013/10/how-many-states-require-front-license-plates/ ) . 
   ny at least has ** some of the best ** , but craziest , drivers in the world . 
  with all the new yorkers moving to my city over the last decade i 'd debate that . 
  considering all the saudi princes that fuck around in la and nyc with their super cars i would be so happy if they just started impounding their toys until they behaved . 
  oh of course not . 
  it was a minority . 
  but just goes to the extreme to show how much some people hate russia to the point where they would wage an extremely bloody war over it . 
  if the us were crazy enough to attack buddy canada i doubt russia would try to get involved since we 've lost our minds . 
  i think it 's safe to say we respect russia and russians but despise their government to the core . 
  what , no they do n't . 
  some people even wanted to go to war with russia over it . 
  we share the same dream , good luck !, 
  but i thought the eu had a higher gdp :(, 
  serious question : does anyone know how much this would actually decrease latency to europe servers ? 
  as an american , brazil is very close relative to europe but they still have lousy ping to us servers . 
  could you explain what would be hard ? 
  i always assumed the nsa and gchq operated however they wanted . 
  that has n't stopped the us from spending billions in wasteful spending before . 
  which i image collect and hand to their own governments just as much . 
  they would n't last very long acting like that, 
  i still ca n't believe no one has gone back . 
  god speed esa . 
  personally i think it would be cool to build a large construction station in orbit around the moon . 
  could be used to support both long range missions , experiments , and collaboration with any kind of moon colonies . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ look , ^ ^ ^ ^ dad ^ ^ ^ ^ does n't ^ ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ ^ out ^ ^ ^ ^ much ^ ^ ^ ^ anymore ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ let ^ ^ ^ ^ him ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ one . 
  it was a joint effort . 
  they started it , we continued it . 
  thanks for making english so popular globally , dad :p, 
  half true . 
  due to population and small number of good chinese universities they 're extremely competitive to get in . 
  this leads to only very smart or very good at cheating people get in . 
  that 's a different situation entirely and depends completely on the employer . 
  some companies will keep a vacancy if you have a legitimate reason for long term leave . 
  otherwise you 're just eating through a salary without compensating your employer with any work . 
  some smaller companies could n't afford that loss of productivity even if they wanted to . 
  i doubt we 'd ever turn completely to asia . 
  europe and its various members are our oldest and strongest allies . 
  the pivot to asia is just to secure our position for the continuation of our global economic dominance and the potential of new chinese influence on the global stage . 
  i know many americans that would love to visit europe . 
  the barrier of entry is mostly the very expensive flight from north america to europe . 
  a lot of people do n't have an extra thousand usd lying around let alone all the living , food , and travel costs . 
  if european countries were willing to subsidize some of the initial plane costs from the us for tourists there would be an explosive growth in euro tourism i 'm sure . 
  well whatever you have heard was the lie . 
  it is true that employer coverage covers pretty much everything . 
  as for being fired , depending on the state you can be fired for anything . 
  i could only see something like fast food firing someone for being sick . 
  companies with salaried employees i 'd find very hard to believe would do such a thing . 
  it is true we do n't have sick leave though . 
  you usually have to use your vacation days . 
  this is weird . 
  you 're the second triangle person i 've seen in / r/europe this week . 
  last year we took in 85,000 refugees . 
  10,000 of which are syrian . 
  this year i believe they 're trying to bring in the same amount . 
  cool . 
  well i wish you luck in whatever way you pursue !, 
  you seem to have given it plenty of thought . 
  sas is a pretty great company if you ever want to consider trying to work for them directly . 
  they 're only a couple miles from me . 
  i ca n't speak for europe but in the states a lot of the bi jobs are based in the finance market so things have been relatively stable . 
  a qualified bi person could be making upwards of $ 70k starting . 
  cool , that 's exactly what my company does ( `` corporate intelligence '' ) . 
  have you tried applying around ? 
  you may be surprised with how many companies may be willing to sponsor you . 
   my health insurance here in germany covers psychologists and psychological treatment . 
  it really depends on what plan you have but it 's possible to get coverage there . 
  my plan for example covers psychological treatment .
