and gammon . 
  gammon is fucking ham, 
  lingonberries should go on everything, 
  why phoenix or estes park ? 
  lol there 's plenty of cities before estes, 
  tons of europeans to to disneyland paris as well , it 's not just for americans, 
  i would imagine it 's because disney wants perfection and probably does n't achieve it . 
  disney world in orlando is actually pretty interesting to read about because of the massive amount of being the scenes work that goes on . 
  i did n't say they were similar i just said i would rank them as both not good tasting . 
  i think you might be underestimating how bad london and italian water tastes, 
  madrid and seville, 
  that word actually looks like someone slammed their face on a keyboard, 
  and when it 's legal you can purchase it with a card, 
  in my experience : good tasting water : north england/scotland , netherlands , austria , iceland , hungary , czech republic meh tasting water : spain , portugal bad tasting water : london , italy why is london water so gross ? 
  this is why western europe is so relatively warm for their latitude , yeah ? 
  can i ask why all the produce in the uk is packaged ? 
  it seems like such a waste . 
  in the us we just have mountains of produce sitting in grocery stores and you bag however many you want yourself . 
  in the uk it 's similar except everything is individually wrapped ( or wrapped in threes or whatever ), 
  not really the same , is it ? 
  they 've had war at their doorstep, 
  til, 
  they both have ~ ~ mountains ~ ~ ~ ~ coasts ~ ~ uhh people ? 
  i met a canadian who thought that denmark was a place in the us ... 
  so it 's not just americans, 
  more interesting than a tricolor at least, 
  it would be good in paris just like it was good in london . 
  brazil did n't work because brazil, 
  it 's like 65 countries though, 
  extreme temperatures in us for comparison http://images.intellicast.com/wximages/customgraphic/wgfhi.gif 70f = 21c 80f = 26c 90f = 32c 100f = 37c 110f = 43c 120f = 49c, 
  except it is illegal . 
  actually legalizing it would be much much better, 
  it has the netherlands in that list if that 's what you 're talking about, 
  oh yeah i meant within the context of the eu !, 
  yes . 
  but most of these countries are in europe . 
  which is what this post is talking about . 
  i 've travelled to a dozen european countries this year without any trouble at all . 
  [ 31 destinations in europe . 
  more than the eu even covers ] ( http://www.three.co.uk/support/roaming_and_international/roaming_abroad/destinations#countries1 ), 
  it works in 60 destinations . 
  [ list on the website ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jgortrw.jpg ) http://www.three.co.uk/feel-at-home/?id=1523&amp;aidset=1  from 15 june 2017 we 'll be adding the following destinations : brazil , singapore , aland islands , french guiana , guadeloupe , martinique , r\u00e9union , saint barth\u00e9lemy , saint martin and san marino . 
  which means it was already free for the most of the rest of the eu, 
  3 has had roaming for years . 
  i pay # 20/12gb in 60 countries, 
  # 20/12gb in 60 countries . 
  it 's been great . 
  i mean 3 has n't had roaming for years ( in europe ) . 
  i have 12gbs pretty much everywhere for # 20, 
  that 's definitely a plot point in an adam sandler movie, 
  i did that in colorado . 
  it 's fun and easy , nothing wrong with line dancing . 
  plus it gets kids out of their comfort zone, 
  i love line dancing are you kidding ? 
  so fun and easy !, 
  by and large , beer is lower percentage in the uk than it is in the us . 
  besides , there 's 4k breweries in the us , we do n't all drink macrobrews . 
  this stereotype is outdated and stupid when you think about the shit macrobrews that europe puts out like carslberg/carling/hieneken / amstel . 
  we have a bigger microbrew culture than many euro countries, 
  i 'm aware of how the geography of the uk is divided , i live here . 
  i 'm just saying the condescension was unnecessary . 
  everyone knows what he meant by gb , it 's not like people are unsure of what country you 're talking about when you say `` america '' and not usa . 
  yeah i was more pointing out that there was no need for the canadian condescension . 
  all of the attacks have happened in england . 
  and it 's not going to happen in wales . 
  england is a fine substitute for gb in this case, 
  i 'm at 8,000 ft so if the water comes up this high i think we 'll all be dead anyways, 
  in linguistics this is the distinction between saying a letter with your vocal chords ( voiced ) and saying a letter without ( voiceless ), 
  when i was learning arabic , my professor said the hardest sound for her to distinguish in english was `` p '' . 
  because in arabic there 's only a `` b '', 
  you sure ? 
  voicing is adding sound . 
  hold on the th of `` that '' ... 
  when i do that i 'm making a sound . 
  but when you hold on the th of `` thorn '' my vocal chords are n't doing anything . 
  also dumb american, 
  tbf , `` yuge '' is just `` huge '' with that gross ny accent, 
  only the one lol but the name calling helps your point, 
  oh look i can use your site and put the us at 11th http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/environment/municipal-waste-generation-per-million total waste instead of municipal is 16th http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/environment/waste-generation-per-million 105th in air pollution http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/environment/pollution-perceptions/air-pollution, 
  yeah i 'm sure not caring about climate change will fix the problem . 
  lol delusional, 
  except we produce less waste per capita than norway and we recycle more than many euro countries, 
  i lost a couple dollars reading op 's post . 
  they just spontaneously caught fire, 
  do n't let him do that !, 
  we have families over here !, 
  do n't forget , lots of people see the us as a literal boogeyman . 
  especially on the internet . 
  the us does a lot of stuff wrong but we 're scrutinized so much more than any number of european countries . 
  browse r/mapporn for your anti-american statistics if you 'd like . 
  we 're obviously the poorest , most violent , unequal , dumb , fatasses that are also somehow very rich with large houses and cars . 
  everyone dies immediately from healthcare issues and all of our food is disgusting and made from plastic . 
  sometimes it 's actually more efficient to not buy local if the local produce was grown in a greenhouse, 
  if you 're asking about businesses avoiding certain tax rates but still do business there , those use tax avoidance techniques like transfer pricing to pay lower tax rates . 
  basically , pretend i 'm starbucks . 
  i want to sell everyone on the planet my overroasted caffeine . 
  what i do , is i set up a branch in luxembourg and and a branch in the uk and i then lease the starbucks ^ tm name to myself from my branch in luxembourg and i buy coffee from myself at ridiculous prices and so on . 
  this makes it look like my uk branch is hermoragging money ( and therefore untaxed ) and my luxembourg branch is booming ( taxed but at the lower , tax haven rate . 
  i 'm gaining the same as i would , but i 'm lowering my tax rate through transfer pricing . 
  [ oh also this is a real situation ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-starbucks-tax-idukbre89e0ex20121015 ) .
