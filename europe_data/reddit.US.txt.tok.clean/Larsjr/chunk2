  in economics this is often called the `` race to the bottom '' where countries compete with lower and lower tax rates, 
  those are all things i hate about european grocery stores lol i guess different strokes . 
  especially baggers , that 's just essential imo, 
  meanwhile it snowed two feet in colorado a week ago at the same latitude as naples ... not in the arctic circle lol, 
  sometimes those special lines backfire , because i 've been in situations where the european lines are super long and i ( american ) just walk up, 
  did you fly over ? 
  i 've had to go through border control every time i 've gone to the uk, 
  wow those are so much better than euros, 
  hahaha cool !, 
  til, 
  lol what is a swamp german, 
  can confirm . 
  i took arabic for awhile and it was hard af, 
  ohhh is vosotros more informal ? 
  useful !, 
  they just do n't use that tense, 
  most state flags are [ atrocious ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/41/df/58/41df580888bbadf1e819becbfd744247.png ) which of course makes us even more proud of our own . 
  i 'm sure she appreciates it !, 
  especially because learning a language as an adult is difficult . 
  i think this is why a lot of people speak mixtures of languages like spanglish . 
  you can practice stuff you know but not fully struggle with a complex thought . 
  example : i can small talk in spanish but fuck no could i express my philosophical take on the world, 
  cool !, 
  [ here 's my state flag !, 
  ] ( https://statesymbolsusa.org/sites/statesymbolsusa.org/files/primary-images/flagofcoloradoco.jpg ), 
  i mean i definitely agree . 
  even the easiest languages are difficult to learn . 
  esperanto requires work and that 's dead easy for westerners, 
  oh man , it always dismays me when the natives switch to english if i 'm obviously struggling . 
  like i understand why , but it always feels like * `` i 've failed '' * . 
  i do n't speak dutch , but i speak spanish fairly well , and most spaniards would n't switch to english when i traveled to spain ... i do n't know if that means i 'm good enough at spanish not to necessitate it , or if they just were n't super well versed in english or what , but it was a good feeling . 
  i definitely have an awful spain-spanish accent too , because in the states we learn latin american ( particularly mexican but not as fast and no slang ) spanish . 
  also - sorry spaniards , i have no idea how vosotros works , us americans are taught * `` you do n't need to learn that , they only do that in spain '' * . 
  cool flag btw , i 've never seen that one before, 
  dutch is supposedly one of the easiest languages to learn for english speakers . 
  i have no idea how true that is , but there you go . 
  yeah i know . 
  that 's what a kebab is in the us . 
  people call them either shish kebabs or just kebabs . 
  usually it 's meat and vegetables grilled, 
  there are two incorrect `` winners '' in the polls the * week before * . 
  i would n't call that always . 
  [ british polls are notoriously unreliable tbf ] ( https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-u-k-snap-election-is-riskier-than-it-seems/ ), 
  everyone needs more tatziki, 
  that makes sense . 
  i was very confused about kebabs when i went to the uk . 
  in the us , a kebab is basically anything on a skewer but in the uk it 's often a half-assed gyro with doner meat on a pita . 
  holy shit what . 
  thanks for that in advance, 
  i do n't often visit spoons haha i just love me some cold pork pie, 
  no problem !, 
  yeah exactly !, 
  it 's not like there 's no wilderness in the uk , it 's just that you ca n't ever really be lost like you can in the us . 
  and definitely , if you have a british accent americans automatically swoon . 
  yeah definitely just a cultural thing haha . 
  everything just feels nicer to me when random strangers are smiling and talking , even if they do n't really mean it wholeheartedly . 
  except i live in the north of england , so it 's fairly rural . 
  i do n't know what it is, 
  what i really need is some of those delicious pork pies that the pubs sell, 
  yeah that 's probably really what it comes down to . 
  personal preference . 
  i 'm very glad to have gotten the opportunity to move out here , but i 'll be happy to move back, 
  hmm maybe i will never understand . 
  i could buy a better sausage roll from walmart of all places, 
  so i live in the uk and everyone raves about greggs . 
  but i seriously do n't understand why ? 
  it 's just mediocre coffee and some microwaveable pasties . 
  maybe i 'm missing something ? 
  for some reason , i decided a couple weeks ago to try my hand at esperanto . 
  so maybe when i 've given that up i 'll hop on the german train, 
  damn that 's bootstrap mentality if i 've ever heard one, 
  paid leave is not a government mandated system in the us ( except for some states ) , it all depends on the employer . 
  the zero number is misleading though , the vast majority of people have about 2 weeks off not including holidays . 
  it 's a shitty system but it 's not like no one gets time off . 
  if an employer did n't offer anything they 'd be pretty hard pressed to keep employees, 
  happens in the us as well, 
  i think this is the real answer, 
  ** ancedotes below ** i 'm american and i live in the uk . 
  i much prefer the us and will thankfully be moving back soon . 
  ** for myself ** , i think it 's a combination of the weather , culture , and honestly an outdoors thing . 
  culturally , people feel very outwardly cold here . 
  they 're incredibly friendly when you get to know them , but there just are n't as many smiles from strangers and small talk with people in a queue . 
  the weather is obvious but the outdoors/population thing is a big one for me . 
  unless you have the luxury of owing a car ( which are incredibly expensive to own/run/maintain here ) , you 're completely at the mercy of wherever the public transit goes , which is almost always other cities . 
  i long to just hop in my car and drive to where there are n't people like i could back home but i ca n't do that here . 
  it 's incredibly populated and it 's time consuming to even get away . 
  i understand that there are millions of people that live cities and european cities are much easier to get around and much nicer to look at imo . 
  it 's very nice to have stuff like the nhs and public transit and mandated leave , but i 'd trade it all to live in the us . 
  ** these thoughts are 100 % ancedotal , please do n't hate me **, 
  sitting over here like `` damn ... '', 
  are there any good publications in the uk ? 
  [ 29 % smokers in france as compared to 19 % in the us . 
  us smokers smoke more but far fewer people actually smoke in the us . 
  ] ( http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/tobacco/use/tablet/atlas.html ), 
  life in the us is 1000x cheaper than in the uk in general i 've found . 
  us gas/alcohol/food are all cheaper than here in england . 
  it 's about # 1.20 / l here which is $ 5.90 / us gallon . 
  fucking ridiculous . 
  last time i was in the us it was under $ 2/gal, 
  this is better than my explanation .
