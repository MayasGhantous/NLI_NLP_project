if russia give me some of their women ? 
  or unlimited breadsticks would be nice . 
  nothing speaks of democracy like an oversize 1000 room palace . / s, 
  it 's official . 
  the south is like a former communist country . 
  as a pennsylvanian i am jealous of both of your country 's roads . 
  religion and government are two seprate entities in america that never touch each other ( except for those random oaths to a bible or god ) . 
   does every entity have a right to secede , in your view ? 
  thats how the united states was born . 
  just the regular concern pro-russian ukrainian civilian getting fighter jets from their local hardware store . 
  [ thats why we need to hire the mongolians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongol_invasion_of_rus' ), 
  i believe it is peace for our time . 
  we thank you from the bottom of our hearts . 
  go home and get a nice quiet sleep . 
  fapping . 
  but they were going against an argentina that went full retard . 
  what will russia do without nutella ? 
  its like if garrymandering was a country . 
  there are a lot of giant secret facilities in poland it seems . 
  to be honest , i want this to happen . 
  i just do n't trust the murder to investigate the crime scene . 
  yea , president obama mention him in his speech . 
  one american, 
  either way , we do n't see 4, 
  considering most of the factions are almost the same and all commit crimes against humanity . 
  why should i help any of those people to win . 
  especially with my life . 
  i 'm waiting for the information on his mental condition . 
  i would put money that he was a schizophrenic . 
  there have been cases of schizophrenics beheading people in public . 
  [ like this one in canada ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/greyhound-killer-believed-man-he-beheaded-was-an-alien-1.1131575 ) and [ this one ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3134592/paranoid-schizophrenic-beheaded-great-grandmother-82-killed-two-cats-believed-demons.html ), 
  [ this is my favroite protest picture . 
  ] ( http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/199985/how-kkk-rally-image-found-new-life-20-years-after-it-was-published/attachment/kkktoddrobertsonphoto/ ), 
  so you do n't want a debate or have your beliefs question . 
  instead you just want everyone you do n't agree with to go away . 
  you need donal trump to be your president to kick out alll the mexicans and build a golden wall . 
  walls and germany goes hand in hand . 
  no no no , the clean coal waf from the coal companies that had the whole `` obama 's war on coal '' storyline . 
  perfect timing though , migrant crisis with a healthy dose of economic pain . 
  they taxed our papaer and teeaaa, 
  there ar n't 200 countries in the world in the first place . 
  why leave nato when russian long range bombers are buzzing around your country ? 
  why leave nato at all ? 
  is it one of those `` clean coal '' bullshit they tried to pull over here in america . 
  [ that hartlepool , brittian lynched a monkey because they thought he was a french spy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monkey_hanger ), 
  yea but good luck trying to remove russia and iran form syria . 
  world war two ? 
  there are us spec ops on the ground too in syria , no surprises that russia are doing the same . 
  academi ( blackwater ) owns a warship . 
  soooo sure . 
  thoes fucking ~ ~ mexicans ~ ~ ^ syrians, 
  yea , never heard of a `` special relationship '' with the uk . 
  [ so uk now have basically have there versions of the mormons fundamentalists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polygamy_in_north_america#current_polygamist_groups ), 
  you forgot kardashians butt . 
   coming to steal your jobs , steal your welfare , rape all the women oh , so like mexicans but darker . 
  [ here is forest cover by us state . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest_cover_by_state_in_the_united_states ), 
  people who want to go to slovenia . 
  well turkey does n't seem to see a difference between ypg and the pkk, 
  at least you fought for your capital . 
  us gave up washington dc without a fight . 
  i mean the city was save from razing by a thunderstorm and a tornado but we still gave up our national capital without any resistance . 
  yea , but as an american i am jealous of your warsaw uprisings . 
  i wish there was anything in us history that could compare to that . 
  [ i understood the reference ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xs5lk.gif ), 
  you mean i ca n't sue you ... 
  lol , sounds like a modern day homestead act . 
  let me put this , this way . 
  terrorism is only really used for forgien people we want to bomb from the air with drones in the us . 
  i mean we could argue that pkk are terrorists and mass shooters in america are terrorists , and they fit the definition . 
  but at this point terrorism is only used as a political boogie man . 
  a justification and a quick way of getting public opinion on your side . 
  they are smarter than most americans who believe if they try and work hard enough they will be millionaires . 
  it should just be a russian flag with the face of putin on it, 
  looks like belarus is in the closet . 
  as a pennsylvanian i never knew something like that ever existed . 
  i do n't think we even get referendums . 
  thank you brittian for settling in north america and losing a rebellion to allow us to exist . 
  thank you poland for pirogies . 
  and thank you russia . 
  i was born after the cold war but now i 'm living in another one !!, 
  i 'm digging the cold war feel . 
  it reminds how spain dresses up as the kkk for one day . 
  just imagining nazis , kkk , ultra nationalists and communist all in the same room seems funny to me . 
  am i the only person who does n't wish for putin to be removed in a coup or died . 
  i hate the man to death but seeing how extreme the possible replacements would be and a huge nuclear stockpile i rather have putin in control of the country than something worse then putin . 
  there 's no real usa subreddit to talk with people , plus i enjoy people from other countries sharing stuff about their country . 
  i would remember my training of watching red dawn . 
  can confirmed , belarus haunts me in my dreams . 
  why is belgium called red devils, 
  we have a lot of things to fix domestically in america and shaving some of our military would go along way . 
  we want germany be able to defend themselves more so we can roll back some of our units . 
  most do n't carry their weight . 
  even if they are smaller they should be hitting 2 % gpd on military . 
  problem with those safe zones was it was a clear political move to block the two largest kurdish territories from merging and to make sure that aleppo fsa still have access to foreign arms and reinforcements . 
  im going to say russia would say no to this . 
  soon as mexico was defeated in the mexican american war , it was clear there was no real competitors on na other than the british . 
  final destination : 9/11 / s, 
  because it was n't accidental , it was a pre planned attack . 
  how the hell can you call 9/11 an accident .
