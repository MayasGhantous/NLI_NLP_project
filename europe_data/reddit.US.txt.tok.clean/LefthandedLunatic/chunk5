  only 10s of thousands of americans went to vigils for the orlando shooting , i guess the rest of the 300 million american are homophobic .

  pretty soon it will be illegal to own cats that look like hitler, 
   fear of trump results in increasing temperature its because of that high energy is heating up the atmosphere, 
  it would be better if we were lead by an unelected white man with black hair a sour personality and a very thin mustache . 
  oh yea i bet us is going to be happy about that/s also im pretty sure plenty of americans including me be very mad if our tax payer money is now being spend on germany 's primary personal defense . 
  nope they do n't , its just a myth . 
  no one can leave the us without another civil war . 
  like out of all of the states ? 
  ohio ? 
  thats like the last state with an independence movement . 
  if anything he should have said texas or california . 
  so its kinda hard to tell as most modern farming techniques are mixed together so its hard to separate the variables . 
  but gm crops with other modern inventions have started the slow and steady decline of aces used in farming with increase productive thats able to sustained a gently growing population . 
  basically we can feed more with less land . 
  for example :  according to usda 's estimates 6.6 million acres of us farmland has been lost from 2008 through 2015 , with a 1 million acre decline last year alone . 
  closer to home usda estimates that both alabama and georgia lost 100,000 acres last year , and 50,000 acres were lost in florida in 2015 . 
  the us farming base has shrunk 7 % in eight years . 
   [ meanwhile the farming output sustainably increased . 
  ] ( https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/charts/productivity2013png/productivity2013_450px.jpeg?v=42352 ) [ here is more numbers if you want to read about the productivity per acer of farmland in the us .

  turkey is the west virginia of europe , it all makes sense now . 
  [ there is a planet money episode on npr about when argentina refuses to pay debts . 
  ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/11/470136949/episode-689-a-hedge-fund-a-country-and-a-big-sailboat ), 
   but mr davis hinted no assessment of the brexit options will be carried out , saying : `` you do n't need a piece of paper with numbers on it to have an economic assessment . '' you know there are economists who are payed to put numbers on a paper for economic assessments . 
  yea like when mao made his farmers make steel and kill as many birds as possible and they starved to death , sure people died without direct hand of the government but the government stupidity defiantly killed them . 
  [ and while your at it here were the policies in place for ukraine during the famine . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/causes_of_the_holodomor ) * if you had extra grain after meeting your quota , you had to give it up . 
  * if you could not meet your quota , you had to give up all your livestock . 
  * if you were a part of collective farm and could n't meet the quota , then the farm was placed on a blacklist and had to give up 15 times the quota . 
  to make sure you did that , activists relieved you of all food . 
  * the quotas you were supposed to meet were then raised impossibly high . 
  * you were not allowed to trade for food . 
  * you were not allowed to receive deliveries of food . 
  * you were not allowed to leave ; the borders were sealed . 
  * you were not even allowed not to help relieve other people of their food if so ordered , under penalty of death . 
  * the policies still continued even when after the larger scale requisition targets were met . 
  you need 5 before you can call it a massacre , then throw the tea into the bay . 
   come and get it [ got a flag for you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/come_and_take_it#/media/file:texas_flag_come_and_take_it.svg ) . 
  its a famous flag from the texas war of independence . 
  give me moderation or give me death, 
   think of the eu as an economic version of mad , where going to war against another member state is just too painful to consider , because you 're indirectly destroying the foundations of your own economy . 
  thats the bases of free trade in general . 
  the idea is if everyone is making money , have easy access to everything they needed and have alot of their assets in foreign lands war would n't happen because its just economically inefficient . 
  its hard to have a resource war when you can just buy the resource . 
  job loss is a minor step that only targets a small minority and this is due to redundancies or more inefficiency then their neighborly counterpart . 
  but this is a nessary small forest fire that needs to happen . 
  do you real should blame the german steel mills for running the us steel industry to the ground or should you blame the us steel industry for being well behind the times using century old facilities that no where matched the effiencies of the foreign brands . 
  even so the job loss attributed to free trade are minimal and the vast minority . 
  the [ estimated job loss from nafta for example was 682,900 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nafta's_effect_on_united_states_employment ) easily negitable by the constant us growth considering during bill clinton presidency the us gained 19 million jobs . 
  2 . international trade courts . 
  this is where the most of the environmental , job safety and protection laws . 
  its just a gross misscolorization of what these courts do . 
  they are here to protect the corporation from discrimination . 
  i know people will roll their eyes when they read that but if people and nations can sue they why ca n't business . 
  this keeps governments in line and not picking favorites when enforcing tariffs and laws . 
  lets say that bmw is the hottest shit right now in the us . 
  everyone is driving them and the us brands are being stifled . 
  a drunk trump then finds a tariff law in his couch cushions on german cars but decided that only bmw will get the tariff . 
  he is singling out a single company and punishing them because they are just better than the domestic brands . 
  you see it all the time in russia , they ban a foreign porn company for `` deviancy '' then replace it with a domestic brand a few months later . 
  now with any court system you get bullshit charges and of course there have been a few that kinda spoil party . 
  cigarettes companies for example argued that they are targeted and try to drag nations into long lawsuits that will probably be thrown out anyways as long as all cigarettes are punished and nations do n't pick favorites . 
  its nessary to have a way to enforce the rules or then whats the point of ftas , over time this have been bastardized to the point of `` eval corporations can sue nations for enviromental standards '' but thats again if they say `` only dutch companies have to follow the standards everyone else do whatever they want '' . 
  other fluff . 
  [ income post fta ( which is 1994 for this example ) have either increase or show minimum effect ] ( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/mehoinusa672n ) even if it did its canada , its not like canadians pay their workers pennies and have kids in the coal mines . 
  how much lower are canadian standards are to yours ? 
  free trade is one of the few things that the vast majority of economist can agree on is a beneficial good for all parties . 
  only a minority of jobs are lost for a large positive net gain in productivity , reduced prices and allows the economy to scale to an even larger size . 
  sure its not free without criticism and some agreements are better than others but generally there is always a positive good even in the worst of treaties . 
  the first iteration of the eu was the `` european economic community '' with the sole purpose of economic integration and the eventual single market in 1957 . 
  and was the foundation of which the rest of the eu was built from . 
  clearly free trade was a top priority because at the time and to this day economist believe free trade prevents war . 
  though the motives i might have gotten wrong the free trade basis of the eu is undeniable and you really ca n't be against free trade while an strong supporter of the eu . 
  oh man this hitler guy is taking over czechoslovakia . 
  oh it looks like they are too weak to counter him i guess we just have to sit on our hands . 
  polish, 
  i mean if you supported the eu but are against the ceta do n't you think you kinda hypocritical . 
  eu is basically built upon free trade between european nations to counter economic us dominance . 
  so why would anyone who support eu thus supports free trade in general would be against ceta ? 
  ca n't wait for picture from the republic of catalonia, 
  should we put all of our opinions on the side of trains and send them to people we hate ?
