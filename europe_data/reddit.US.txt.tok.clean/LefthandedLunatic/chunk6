  itt `` we are tired of these experts with their acronyms and knowlege '', 
  according to the associated press ,  `` according to one u.s. official , national security aides have sought information about polish incursions in belarus , an eyebrow-raising request because little evidence of such activities appears to exist . 
  poland is among the eastern european nations worried about trump 's friendlier tone on russia . '', 
  soo is that the polish incursions that trump though poland was doing ? 
   hey , hey . 
  i kinda want belarus to make something about itself . 
  they are big in make tractors industry . 
  soo they have that . 
  am i the only one having problems with the new name , i keep saying chechen as in chechnya, 
  see they took the deus ex school of architecture, 
  one thing i notice about the united states is that we never really have a military parade . 
  we had a russian who was adopted in america in our school , she was kinda cool but then was homeschooled later so i never really gotten to see her . 
  she was also decent in soccer . 
  kinda sad that the russian adoption program fell apart , one of the first victims of the russian us divide in recent years . 
   i mean it even counts birth ratio into the `` country score '' . 
  thats probably due to china one child policy leaving alot of female babies being aborted as male children are preferred in their culture . 
  unless you are lockheed martin :p, 
  welcome to the balkans, 
   ( i do n't know why this is being downvoted ) because you made a comment in the balkans so now you are in the crossfire of the balkans karma comment war . 
  so not / r/russiadenies, 
  yea considering that the us population have been heavily anti war since iraq . 
   if you ask americans you mean / r/the _ donald not all americans . 
  / r/merica will wait and sell arms to both sides until they join the side that 's clearly winning . 
  reminds me of the [ huroncane ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_lake_huron_cyclone ), 
  markets do n't like upsets . 
  i should have put an / s i though i was obviously not serious . 
  i think this is the plot to death stranding . 
  can your butt tell me who will win the second hundred year war ? 
  will quebec be a french colony again ? 
  buy buy buy . 
  soo when do we get ww3 . 
  ca n't wait until the british and the french get killing eachother again . 
  i still think penty of americans still have some shock and fear left over from 9/11 . 
  [ wew lads , looks at the cliff we have fallen off too . 
  ] ( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/gdpc1 ) [ or how violent we have all become ] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/191219/reported-violent-crime-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/ ) . 
  lol , us is no . 
  1 for business eviorment . 
  i am not surprise, 
  ca n't wait for the `` secret negotiations '' , `` free trade is a zero sum game '' , `` corporations can overrule law '' and so on, 
  does anyone else find the tower creepy . 
  because the other canidate was le pen, 
  or you can make your unique identity and culture the center of tourism . 
  we have a unique dialect here in pittsburgh that is n't seen anywhere else in the us and we put it shirts , commercials , mugs whatever . 
  part of reasons why people want to go to a location is to see something new and different not the same thing they always have been seeing . 
  so even with an influx of out of state people going in and though our city our dialect have not diminished abit infact its now bigger than it ever was . 
  subtitles exist bae , plus [ just because it did n't happen in poland does n't mean it does n't happen . 
  recently we had a case in florida were a neonazi converted to islam and murdered his roommates in the name of allah ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/05/23/a-neo-nazi-converted-to-islam-and-killed-2-roommates-for-disrespecting-his-faith-police-say/?utm_term=.7bdc8a7d854c ) . 
  [ then we have people fleeing to isis ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/22/world/middleeast/german-teenager-isis-iraq.html ) people are violent and they are going to look for any justification possible . 
  allah or not they will bomb you . 
  for example in columbine the goal was n't to have a `` school shooting '' it was to bomb the school . 
  they wanted to be terrorists and not mass shooters even though they had no political agenda planned . 
  i mean look at the rise of nazism on reddit in the past few years , are you really thinking that islamic groups ar n't sharing the same success as the alt right ? 
  then tell isis to stop using the internet then , clearly their propaganda is not working . 
  no one forms beleifs or get radicalized from the internet apparently . 
  we do n't have teenage girls converting and running to isis . 
  why do we even bother have political campaigns on the internet then if they clearly have no effect on people what so ever ? 
   completely wrong , lol . 
  radical islamism spreads primarily by migration and then by direct contact . 
  lone wolf radicals radicalized over the internet with no prior connection to islam are extremely rare . 
  there will be no islamist attacks in poland as long as they stick to their strict immigration policy . 
  [ its so rare it does n't even have a handy wikipedia list that shows 94 lone wolf terrorists attacks since 1988 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lone_wolf_ ( terrorism ) #list _ of_lone_wolf_terrorist_attacks ) ( yes i counted them all ), 
   well , a lot of things are ` homegrown ' . 
  the fact that there are islamic terrorists who were born in europe does not change the fact that they are still inspired by islamism . 
  you know you have such thing called the internet . 
  they do n't need to see a radical islamist to get radicalized . 
  radical islam is n't a little disease that spreads by direct contact . 
   this is a comparison i reject . 
  please do not distract from the topic which is islamism . 
  we do not need to make analogies . 
  islam has its own specific problems . 
   what happened in ireland was a ethno-religious conflict and was about a specific place . 
  the threat of islamism has no borders or region as islam is a globalist religion which does not discriminate based on region . 
  wew lads , i was making the point of where do we cut the line in calling a population to dangerous for poland . 
  i mean should we worry about americans exporting their radical sovereign citizens ? 
  they already exist in germany !, 
  sure they might not have the exact same issues but i though we were talking about banning populations for their violent minorities here . 
   what nation are you talking about ? 
  we were talking about islam . 
  well i hope if we are going to ban islamic nations the same rule applies to all nations :p or are we just banning people from the islamic world because they look scarier ? 
   brekvik 's ideology is not endorsed by most people from norway . 
   on the other hand , islamist principles is being endorsed by hundreds of millions of muslims . 
  in some countries , it is even the majority . 
  does that even matter ? 
  they are only going to be a small percentage also you know political change exist . 
  you know moderate muslims are common and vast majority are non violent . 
  people tend to be less extreme when they do n't live in an area where terrorists attacks , beheadings and war is common . 
  almost all terrorists attacks have been [ reported to police by fellow muslims ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/thirteen-terror-attacks-foiled-in-under-four-years-10791804 ) , [ thousands upon thousands of them come out to condem the attacks in uk ] ( https://muslimscondemn.com/ ) and [ 500 imams refused to buried the attackers . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-attack-imans-no-funeral-prayers-terrorists-refuse-500-muslim-clerics-islam-isis-burial-khuram-a7776861.html ) [ here is some more cases ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/muslim-women-stand-solidarity-london-terror-attack-victims-westminster-bridge-khalid-masood-a7651361.html ) [ 2 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/23/uk-muslim-leaders-condemn-cowardly-london-attack ) [ 3 ] ( http://orlandostatement.com/ ) [ want over 5000 cases of muslims condemning terrorism ? 
  ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e8bjmw36cmnc4-qc9unqku0blstzszp5fmtkdlavqzc/edit#gid=0 ) at this point we should start investigating people at an individual level then broadly banning whole 1/7th of the world from poland . 
  this flat ban does n't fix the problem at hand , it hurts the economy and does n't allow us to intergrate the islamic population . 
  xenophobia is an irrational fear of outsiders and here you got millions of non violent muslims who do n't conduct terrorists attacks who have a proven ability to intergrate . 
  report more islamic terrorists to our police then anyone else and have done their part in condemning it and combating against it . 
  unlike most europeans , muslims are on the ground fighting tooth and nail against isis . 
  but they are too dangerous and want to kill us all huh ? 
   to be honest considering the terrorist attacks in combination with the ungratefulness of many islamic migrants in western countries , it is not illogical that poland , a country with a history of being torn up by foreigners is being wary of radical forms of religion . 
  ya know alot of terrorism is home grown . 
  there is n't anything banning migrants will do considering polish themselves will convert to islam and conduct attacks as well . 
  and if we are going to ban dangerous people , of course then that brings the whole logistics of where and how do we consider what people are what you see as `` inherently '' violent because they carry out attacks . 
  [ would n't that then have to include banning all americans from poland ? 
  ] ( https://apps.revealnews.org/homegrown-terror/ ) i mean americans have been bombing and killing other americans long before islam was a thing and have been killing each other much more often then islam has there so its clearly the bigger threat .
