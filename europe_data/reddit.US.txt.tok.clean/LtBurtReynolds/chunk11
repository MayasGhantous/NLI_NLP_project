  but then again it is completely reasonable as a strategy . 
  that 's desperate . 
   yeah , countries that mess with the us have a tendency to collapse . 
  the us has had trade , diplomatic and territory disputes with virtually every country on the planet . 
   venezuela right now etc. 
  yeah , the us created their horrible leadership . 
   according to my reddit-influenced view , most us church goers would be laughed out of german churches for their radical views . 
  yeah man , they 're crazy extremists . 
  they 're so crazy most go once a year !, 
  you heard about bernie sanders being jewish or how ted cruz seemed to reference god a lot . 
  we did ? 
  the only thing i can recall is trump saying stupid shit about muslim immigration and he was massively made fun of for it . 
  but candidates do try to pander to religious groups like they do any other voting bloc if that 's what you mean . 
  it 's mostly shallow rhetoric . 
   just following the us elections you see a lot more people caring about the faith of the candidates than here in germany then your media is pretty shitty considering religion has n't even been a remotely important issue in this campaign . 
  is that why you 're banning religious clothing . 
   you guys are also very prone to treating every individual of a given country as if its people were a single consciousness . 
  you mean like you 're doing right now ? 
  this is a classic case of projection . 
  work on it . 
   individual dutch feel no more or less gratitude towards individual canadians than any other people . 
  that 's not what i hear from you guys and canadians every time it 's brought up . 
  here are some examples . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/35undr/til_the_dutch_royal_family_took_refuge_in_canada/ https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1dq5ue/til_that_for_one_day_in_1940_a_section_of_a/ https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/17x58u/til_every_year_the_netherlands_sends_20000_tulip/ https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2l7myt/til_that_the_netherlands_sends_20000_tulips_to/ https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1tmtvj/til_the_netherlands_has_been_sending_canada_10000/ https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1opud1/til_that_the_netherlands_sends_20000_tulips/ https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1bpwl7/til_the_netherlands_sends_canada_10000_tulips/ https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/131fsc/til_the_dutch_royal_family_sent_canada_a_gift_of/ https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/d3t8l/til_that_canada_receives_an_annual_gift_of_10000/  whereas you guys still seem to feel pride over something you did n't even helped do ; that has become hugely exaggerated through propaganda ; putin , is that you ? 
   speaking of which , you also seem to be one of the few countries where people do n't seem to be aware that making holocaust jokes about germans is actually extremely insulting and considered wildly inappropriate i thought you did n't take history personally ? 
  nothing you said is even close to consistent . 
  i feel sorry fro you , you 're irrationally angry and hateful . 
   we are not the us exactly , you teach religion in schools , we do n't . 
  [ i think this would be a better tactic ] ( https://youtu.be/s5y8tfq01oy?t=15 ) , obama is a huge john cusack fan . 
  you 're the one taking it personally and emotionally . 
  i 'm having a laugh at historical context . 
  as if it happened last week and they were personally there . 
  is that why you guys send flowers to canada every year . 
  very key given their closeness to russia and reluctance to do anything for quite some time . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28423733  but she has powerful lobbyists whispering against sanctions in her ear . 
  the heads of adidas , siemens and thyssenkrupp have all expressed big unease about tougher sanctions and questioned whether western leaders had mis-handled the relationship with mr putin . 
   the guest list for president putin 's recent birthday party had a substantial german contingent , not least former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , who was pictured hugging mr putin . 
  mr schroeder is chairman of the shareholder committee of nord stream , a pipeline company owned by the russian energy company gazprom . 
  meanwhile former chancellor helmut schmidt said that russia 's actions in the crimea were `` completely understandable '' . 
   the question is how much cooperation with russia a nato member can afford before they become a liability for the alliance . 
  you talking germany or turkey ? 
   now kick out the us . 
  they should . 
   europe has some very complex internal issues to focus on , which are arguably more urgent . 
  this is not unique to them . 
   america and canada remove some of the need for militarism , so we 're actually part of the problem . 
  i agree , the us needs to remove itself from nato because it 's not a n equal partnership . 
   others adopted pacifism and neutrality because of disasters caused by militarism . 
  no one ever did that . 
   fairly nationalistic myself no you 're not , all you do is whine and seek the approval of people who would n't piss on you if you were on fire . 
  you 're the obnoxious self-loathing american stereotype . 
  for fucks sake , you claimed ireland is a major world power on par with the us and russia . 
  gtfo . 
  if the facts about nato make you uncomfortable ignore the discussions . 
  thanks for some random link to a useless index . 
  3 # 1 's , that great . 
  that 's very well known . 
  now answer the question . 
  do you just make this shit up as you go or are you really this delusional ? 
   , but we ca n't let them get away with what 's happening in donbass . 
  what exactly is ireland doing to thwart russia ? 
  ah yes , vote manipulation is a good tactic when you do n't have a point . 
  he 's wrong , she 's wrong and you ca n't even come up with anything to say . 
   his ego is already inflated speaking of which . 
   the most civilised and cultured place on the planet ,  we might call it another level of european civilisation  the biggest question for europe today is , how to get along with the rest of the world which is n't on the same level yet ? 
  holy shit . 
  that 's a good idea . 
   what you perceive as contempt is merely a reflection of the good deed not cancelling the bad one . 
  i perceive it as contempt because the title literally has nothing to do with the video . 
   so the type of discussion is the same . 
  nut it 's not the same , not at all and it 's based on a fabricated title . 
  and it 's not like this is news , what 's the point of this at all ? 
  that makes sense . 
  it 's also funny that he 's suggesting others should act against their own interest so his nation does n't have to act against their own interest . 
   due to history and bloody past , europeans want peaceful solutions and to get along with everyone over anything else . 
  is that why you were bombing libya and are bombing isis . 
   we might call it another level of european civilisation since europe got so humane compare to its own past and the rest of the world . 
  europe , humanity evolved . 
   the biggest question for europe today is , how to get along with the rest of the world which is n't on the same level yet yes maybe one day nations like japan , canada and the usa will be on the level of the czech republic . 
  but the comment was from a german . 
  oh and the title is just made up , there is no study just some random wwii video . 
  and despite that we have a huge circlejerk going on here . 
  latvia should take a stand and sanction the us until they cut ties with the ksa . 
  show the world that america is the `` problem . '', 
  the funny part about this whole thread is , the video in no way even matches the title . 
  it 's fabricated . 
  but trust us , america is bad . 
  i 'll take that as a no . 
   amazing , an entire page of discussions all talking about literally just a misleading title . 
  why do you think that is ? 
  it 's called sarcasm , i thought i piled it on pretty thick.you should let the people who are actually saying things know your feelings . 
  like the guy i responded to . 
  how long do you plan on stalking me ? 
  if it 's going to be a long time can you at least try and be clever or funny ? 
  not really but you have to admit there is some humor in a german smugly lecturing others about their history in the context of wwii . 
  the video does n't even really fit the title . 
  but the thread has brought out some crazy shit a guy talking about how he wishes the russian liberated france and another telling me the us was only in it because of a business conspiracy . 
   thing is , people that stupid , will never know they are stupid . 
  i suppose that 's why they 're stupid . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychological_projection you 're the person who does n't know what lend lease is , thinks the war was a massive business conspiracy , and has no idea how arms were procured during the war .
