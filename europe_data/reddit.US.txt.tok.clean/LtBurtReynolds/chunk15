  no one , those troops are there to play basketball and drink beer . 
  we agree that the us is n't protecting europe and needs to go right ? 
   i do n't see how 62,000 troops provides meaningful protection in europe . 
  of course , you 've played civ 5 and know all about this kind of thing . 
   the uk and france have their own nukes which can easily be in range of any proper threats . 
  yes , step one of any conflict is nukes . 
   nobody is really going to invade europe , at least not western europe ( which is where all the american troops are ) agreed . 
   america is clearly protecting their own interests and wiggling their wang at russia . 
  it is n't about europe at all . 
  yes nothing says protecting our own interests like pending billions of dollars on troops in the richest nations on the planet which are our economic and diplomatic adversaries . 
   what ? 
  firstly , because they 're not needed . 
  [ neither are us troops as you guys have said ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4uzsak/military_expenditures_per_capita_and_as_of_gdp_in/d5ubonn ) and workers would add more to the economy . 
   it generates economic activity for the local economy . 
  so it 's only a benefit for europe and americans should be trying to gtfo , agreed . 
   you claim it 's a `` demand '' , but you ca n't actually provide a source for that , right ? 
  the fact that they exist is n't enough , do you think the us forced these bases on them ? 
  lets all work together to get the us out of europe . 
  i just hope you 're there to back me up in the threads where i say nato should be dissolved . 
  so kick them out . 
  but according to the people here [ the usa is not in eruope to come to their aid ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4uzsak/military_expenditures_per_capita_and_as_of_gdp_in/d5uaayn ) and only creates problems . 
  an estonian told me the otehr day that russia was right to spy on the us and we had it coming . 
  so i can see where trump is coming from in that regard . 
  good to see the german media is back on track . 
  we 've established in [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4uzsak/military_expenditures_per_capita_and_as_of_gdp_in/ ) that nato is a us tool for hostility and does n't help europe . 
  now we have evidence that it 's creating wars in europe . 
  wish i could upvote this twice . 
   money ? 
  those bases are good for the economy . 
  so why not just invite american workers to set up shop , why the military if it 's about economics . 
   as for `` demand '' , who are you talking about ? 
  every nato country with american troops there . 
  they are n't , why do your leaders demand us troops to be there ? 
  here 's what you 're missing , he does n't want american troops in europe or the middle east . 
  it 's strange you 're being downvoted for not wanting to waste your own money . 
  epecially when these people decided [ america is the root cause of their problems ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4v0b09/why_europe_is_paying_for_american_sins/ ), 
  yeah all the real germans play for their national soccer team . 
   europe and america together try to push `` democracy '' in other countries , and what you get then ? 
  current situation . 
  yeah , this is why someone who grew up in belgium attacked france . 
  i wish i could upvote this twice . 
   a total of 800 germans have joined the ranks of isis since the beginning of the syrian conflict , a third of them have already returned to germany . 
  america is the reason young europeans are becoming radical and attacking their home nations . 
  you should have turned on the bbc or read the guardian . 
   perhaps us corporations act like they can do anything they want without regard to consumer protection/environment etc no , that 's not how this works at all . 
   give asylum to a whistleblower , what a crime . . 
  he 's a spy and by no means a whistleblower . 
  you are not our ally it seems and should be treated accordingly . 
  no , look at the protectionism we see here and the eu constantly suing us corporations . 
  look at germans and others sucking the cock of putin . 
  look at all those that want to give snowden asylum . 
  i do n't think they concern americans . 
   best food in the world lol you 're a funny guy . 
   open and transparent elections where you elect repressive sexist leaders . 
   5 weeks paid holidays a year minimum if you 're lucky enough to have a job . 
  massive emigration . 
   no one cares about your religion here you 're either a troll or delusional , you live in a theocracy . 
   healthy lifestyle there is nothing healthy about living in pubs and chain smoking . 
   , higher earnings and better quality of life . 
  and troll confirmed . 
  when you 're up to speed let us know . 
   here is the link that is used by every nato sceptic in the world you should be ashamed and embarrassed . 
   and russian military for the past seventy five years has been build to beat you . 
  yes all those times warsaw pact gear beat us gear . 
  gtfo, 
   baltic states are n't worth fighting a world war over . 
   poland is n't worth fighting a world war over . 
   central europe is n't worth fighting a world war over . 
   a couple of german states are n't worth fighting a world war over . 
  this is all completely reasonable . 
   when is it worth fighting a world war then ? 
  when you got that cancer spread all the way to viena ? 
  to paris ? 
  maybe canada or mexico, 
   baltics are literally on the doorstep of russia . 
  its their turf . 
  except for of course , the people actually living there . .  baltics are simply to easy to encircle and turn into a kettle . 
  we have a war nerd expert here !, 
   and russian military for the past seventy five years has been build to beat you . 
  which is why they pretty much do n't exist . 
   here is the link that is used by every nato sceptic in the world you mean from every armchair teenager who knows shit about nothing . 
  they lost their appetite for war upon even thinking about fighting the germans and were complicit in all their crimes . 
   the us has a different goal . 
  a huge share of its military spending gets used in the pacific for aiding sk , japan or australia . 
  and a huge part of yours gets wasted by not existing . 
  we 'll be out , you can handle your won business . 
   but you have to admit your current elections and economy are an utter mess . 
  no , they are n't . 
  your knowledge if the us comes entirely from tabloid media and reddit . 
   most of the world favoured america very very favorably until 2001 . 
  things changed dramatically after that . 
  that 's far from true , especially given during the ideological cold war . 
  i take it you never lived during that time ? 
   i do n't know any other country who did that many did , but your countrymen and neighbors took to telling us we deserved it until about a year ago . 
  even the guardian and bbc aired shows the day after 9/11 discussing how the usa deserved to be attacked . 
  and many british and european were happy to see it . 
   i 'm not alone in the world thinking that america 's relations with the world went downhill fast after that . 
  except they did n't because your leaders shared the same views . 
   we admire your ambition and all the good you 've brought to society too bad you ca n't even manage that . 
   equally laughing their assess off and seriously worried about who you 're going to elect the next president .
