  agreed , you ca n't trust the us and should not be in an alliance with them . 
  so half do n't . 
  that 's good . 
   some people seem to think that brexit is an internal matter which only brits are allowed to say anything about . 
  unlike us politics which everyone thinks they should be involved in . 
  they 're not claiming it is n't are they ? 
  they 'll hate you regardless and this shows how their media spins things . 
  the state departments releases reports on every country . 
  it does n't denounce anything it just reports that facts they were able to gather so us diplomats and politicians can be better informed . 
  stick around , the people on this subreddit literally think americans have no access to cheese , real food , only one type of bread and the only beer that exists is bud or the equivalent . 
  cuba , unlike america , has real cheese . 
  why did n't they name it * save the babies or else you 're a commie nazi * if that 's what they 're going for . 
  unfortunately since the us can literally not get cheese that does n't come in a can and only can make one type of bread , we have no pizza . 
   dude ever heard of per capita ? 
  doing that would mean that the us has as many nobel prizes as about france and the netherlands and germany and uk are higher . 
  yeah because per capita is a reasonable metric for something that only applies to a subset of individuals and not the general public . 
  i guess this means trinidad and tobago is the greatest nation in sporting because of their performance at the olympics . 
  but you are right for the rest , america is a shit country and awful . 
   our top minds were killed or left . 
  actually it was mostly just your poor and minorities . 
  yeah , why stray from the norm . 
   xactly the same reason why `` patriot act '' was so named . 
  `` oh you 're against the patriot act so you hate patriots so you hate america hurr durr . '', 
  they think giving it a positive name makes it immune to criticism . 
  hate to break it to you but , that 's not even it 's name . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patriot_act  its title is a ten-letter backronym ( u.s.a. 
  p.a.t.r.i.o.t. ), 
  that stands for `` uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 '', 
   also , sweden is possibly the most socially advanced country in the world . 
  greatest nation in human history . 
  have you been told what life is like in the us ? 
  i was n't 100 % sure either but luckily reddit has experts from europe to tell us . 
  you will be shot within hours of arrival due to the [ constant rampages ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ca0ks/donald_trump_britain_and_europe_are_not_safe/d1gbok8 ) and if that 's not bad enough there is a 99 % chance the police will [ randomly assault you ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ca0ks/donald_trump_britain_and_europe_are_not_safe/d1g9uyo ) . 
  most europeans [ are scared to go to the us because of this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ccl5l/british_man_dies_after_brutal_san_francisco/d1hn5ie ) and there is literally no healthcare in the us . 
  you will die in the street . 
  if you 're lucky to survive the day [ our massive food portions ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1ih3ew/nonamericans_what_about_the_americaamericans_has/cb4e04s ) will kill you because food in the usa [ is literally poisonous shit that would be illegal in europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4bbmjh/why_is_the_quality_of_food_in_europe_wheat_fruit/ ) . 
  america has no [ history or culture ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4el5x8/czech_republic_aims_to_be_called_czechia_in/d2191qt ) so there is nothing interesting to do there . 
  [ and as most germans agree , the usa is an evil country ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/documentaries/comments/4agj3q/%e4%ba%ba%e6%9d%83%e5%8d%ab%e5%a3%ab%e7%9a%84%e4%ba%ba%e6%9d%83%e7%ba%aa%e5%bd%95_%e5%a4%ae%e8%a7%86%e5%88%b6%e4%bd%9c_2015_documentary_from_chinese/d10fcai ) . 
  go to the uk instead , [ they are literally better at everything ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/4dfv0j/what_does_britain_do_better_than_america/ ) . 
  i know , he does n't seem to . 
  what romanian in their right mind would want to visit the us ? 
  agreed , it 's time france and poland cut ties with the us and place sanctions of them for iraq and libya . 
   as far as i know you mean you googled it a few seconds before you wrote this . 
  russia claims a lot of territory in the arctic that canada says is canadian , will you cry when they take it ? 
  which they will . 
  this is what our great allies actually think . 
  with any luck one day the us will have the a global cultural impact like that of lithuania . 
  agreed , it was very unsafe for the us ship to be 70 nautical miles from kaliningrad . 
  apples to apples , and what business does amerikkka have being there at all . 
  only for provocation . 
  yeah there are massive cattle farms and cowboys in delaware . 
  like cheese , wine , beer , and edible food , americans ca n't get dogs . 
  it 's a european thing really . 
  swedes have spent years telling everyone they are the pinnacle of human civilization . 
  nothing can stop them from being the best at everything . 
  there is no american education system . 
  people in glass houses . 
   i know you guys lack a beer culture per se , yeah , there is no beer culture in the us . 
  we also ca n't get real cheese , chocolate and are not taught evolution . 
  americans are backwards , upvote !, 
  yeah i 'm sure these guys are really up on their 1950 's french history . 
  yeah , 1400 of them whoi left 6 years ago  and being more effective . 
  see , this type of shit is ridiculous . 
  well since you 're so sure of that you clearly do n't need ineffective shit soldiers like americans in an alliance with you . 
  i 'm going to the market after work , when checking out i 'll tell the young immigrant working there that my ( as described here ) * `` tasteless shit american food that would be illegal in europe '' * will be purchased by ` global influence ' ... send a bill to latvia . 
  jesus with allies like this who needs enemies . 
   come with better proof . 
  and after there was only token support  here was more proof that saudi arabia was behind the attacks then afghanistan . 
  uh no , the people who conducted and masterminded the attack were living in afghanistan , it does n't matter where they were born . 
  they were given a home there to train and live and the rulers refused to turn over the leadership . 
  if you 're opposed to backing a nation member who has been directly attacked by this group several times resulting in the deaths of thousands you should n't be in an alliance . 
  [ i saw americans fighting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_security_assistance_force ), 
  the german government usually opposes everything the us does and always is going after us business . 
  the iraqis forced him out and at the time everyone on the left and in europe was saying iraq would be better off without americans . 
  [ as was pointed out , it really was n't . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dvo6h/united_states_sends_additional_troops_to_eastern/d1v3hx2 ), 
  with maybe one or two exceptions the us does n't just decide to arbitrarily `` meddle '' there is a reason and it 's usually a group or nation asking for assistance . 
  look at the cold war , us troops keeping west germany safe from a russian invasion and what does the us have to show for it , billions of dollars lost and a germany which is as close to openly hostile to the us as it can be . 
  the germans hate americans and i do n't see this being any different . 
   food laws regarding what chemicals get into it are much stricter here than in your country such as ? 
   because majority of americans are afraid of `` communism '' aka universal health care , free education and free housing , which are publicly funded through taxation . 
  the us has all those things for the ones who need it . 
   lose global superpower status an be dictated by china or india or brazil or russia . 
  no one will be dictating anything to the us if we remove troops from europe . 
   lose global superpower status an be dictated by china or india or brazil or russia . 
  but i thought terrorism against us was our won fault for meddling ? 
   upside is the united states has the final say in nearly every aspect of nato european nato members called for action in libya and syria . 
  only a handful did anything in libya and they all rejected syria . 
  the us got nothing but token support from everyone but the uk in afghanistan and iraq . 
  nato nation are n't very willing to help each other and the us hardly dictates policy . 
  the polish leaders have had some choice comments about the us and obama lately , you 've heard ? 
  and historically that 's how it starts quite often . 
  look at how often we see germans tell us the us is `` occupying them . '', 
  a few years down the line these people will be saying what i wrote and no good will or benefit will come from this . 
  is that it starts most of the time ? 
  american [ literally ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4bbmjh/why_is_the_quality_of_food_in_europe_wheat_fruit/d17sujh ) lacks the ability to produce or import good chocolate . 
  it 's weird . 
  having a strong navy does n't mean we need army bases in europe . 
  one only one party even says is true . 
  i dunno man , it just seems like you really care about what some anonymous americans on reddit think about nato .
