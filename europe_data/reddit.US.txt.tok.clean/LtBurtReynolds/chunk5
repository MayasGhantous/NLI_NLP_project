  are you sure you 're not a useless idiot hired to make americans look like braindead dickless man children ? 
  if you have an opinion on the topic we 're discussing , feel free to join in . 
   i delete all of my non science posts , because it takes more time when i want to reference something . 
  it 's called `` save . '', 
  and there are no comments in this thread , do you have anything to say aside from * stop mocking the ridiculous ideas of morons * ? 
  now back to your regularly scheduled groveling . 
   oh cool , so having an actual debate and listing sources is groveling ? 
  i do n't see you doing that , why are n't you ? 
  i am , as you can see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dqm51/eu_may_require_visas_from_americans_and_canadians/d1uygs8 ) , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dvo6h/united_states_sends_additional_troops_to_eastern/d1uwnzd ) and [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dvo6h/united_states_sends_additional_troops_to_eastern/d1uvu73 ) nothing from you . 
   you do n't have a sharp enough wit if that 's your goal . 
  i do n't care what a guy who says shit like `` human exceptionalism that has been the greatest enemy to ecosystems worldwide . '', 
  human exceptionalism , that 's the most retarded thing that anyone has ever thought of . 
   when some europeans say dumb shit like `` americans ca n't make good beer '' you can actually link them to all the cool stuff happening with craft beer here instead of a long winded string of pissy sarcasm . 
  if you disagree why are n't you correcting what i wrote with cited facts ? 
  see , no . 
  that is a waste of time and does n't get through to them . 
  hateful people are not interested in facts and groveling to them wo n't change anything . 
  mocking the fact that they think such ridiculous things is the only option . 
  there was a thread about how food in europe is perfect and the us was inedible pig shit . 
  either you agreed or you got downvoted even when linking to facts showing they have the same ingredients . 
  it 's an echo chamber of confirmation bias . 
  have some fun with it , you ca n't actually win . 
   yeah that 's exactly what i said ... not . 
  you really want it both ways , insulting americans yet demanding their respect . 
  saying america is n't strong and mocking the idea that anyone would even say it is . 
   also about the links , call me naive or whatever but if nato is such a bad thing for the us then just stop taking part it , we 're working on it . 
   not entirely true but whatever america big i guess . 
  perfect , then we agree , europe is so powerful it does n't need the us . 
   america big i guess . 
  sooner or later it always comes out . 
   we did for example , probably everyone else too , citation needed and can you show when it happened and when it was originally called for ? 
  [ perhaps most significantly , mr. gates issued a dire warning that the united states , the traditional leader and bankroller of the alliance , is exhausted by a decade of war and and its own mounting budget deficits , and simply may not see nato as worth supporting any longer .

   while the libya war was unanimously endorsed by nato nations , less than half are participating , and less than a third are carrying out strike missions . 
   `` frankly , many of those allies sitting on the sidelines do so not because they do not want to participate , but simply because they ca n't , '' mr. gates said . 
  `` the military capabilities simply are n't there . ''  the libya operation has proven the alliance is desperately short of intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft , as well as aerial refueling planes -- all are crucial to modern combat, 
  and ? 
  without you no one would be confirming their beliefs . 
  `` muricans ca n't get real food ... '' `` as an american i agree , our cheese comes in a can an all we have is bud lite ! '', 
  the cycle of the circlejerk . 
   yeah because a strong nato is not in the us interes nato is n't strong , the us is . 
   his visa waiver thing ? 
  i 'm for removing that . 
  i 'm against having americans in their country or a military alliance . 
   that 's why they totally did n't demand eu countries to increase spending in their military and no one did . 
  go ahead and quote the part of that article that proves anything or is anything other than opinion . 
  you skipped the pdf with the 48 different citations . 
   i did n't read the nato one because it 's from nato . 
  would you read a source i link you from the russian government about the issue ? 
  you pretty much did . 
  and here 's the bottom line . 
   russian officials claim that us and german officials promised in 1990 that nato would not expand into eastern and central europe , build military infrastructure near russia 's borders or permanently deploy troops there . 
   no such pledge was made , and no evidence to back up russia 's claims has ever been produced . 
  should such a promise have been made by nato as such , it would have to have been as a formal , written decision by all nato allies . 
  furthermore , the consideration of enlarging nato came years after german reunification . 
  this issue was not yet on the agenda when russia claims these promises were made . 
  you guys never stop tell us these things so lets not forget them . 
  you did n't even bother to read them , that much is clear . 
  like the us and germany . 
  they do , but seem to expect the world in return when they contribute very little . 
  the us does n't act in it 's own interest as we can see by their participation in the black hole of nato . 
   and they do have a point , powerful countries like the us and germany for example have sometimes fucked eastern europe in the ass good then they should want nothing to do with us if all they receive is victimization . 
  the us was the world leading economy since the late 1800 's . 
  bernie wants to keep nato in place , trump does n't . 
  his only sensible position . 
  but they 're allies ? 
  just like the us and germany . 
   world 's only superpower no we 're not , we 're poor , backward , religious , have no healthcare , are bankrupt , fat , stupid , fascists and we live in a violent cesspool of guns . 
  which you guys always like to remind us , we have shit to sort out . 
  china and russia will get your back and you 'll have that `` multi-polar '' world you 've been hoping for . 
  [ this is more than just demanding respect ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dqm51/eu_may_require_visas_from_americans_and_canadians/d1ul1k6 ) . 
  they 're claiming they are the victims of the us and hate us for the things `` we forced on them . '', 
  they can kindly fuck off . 
  not really , when every european you 've met for over a decade has been calling you a nazi and your leaders `` literally hitler '' you tend to change your worldview . 
  the older people feel a connection to nato because of the cold war but people 40 and under can do without fake allies . 
  the fact is [ european nato nations do n't feel there is a need to defend each other ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/opinion-a-slap-in-the-face-for-east-europeans-and-americans/a-18509284 ) and [ support for nato ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/1-nato-public-opinion-wary-of-russia-leary-of-action-on-ukraine/ ) is falling . 
   spain do more than half of people on the left have an unfavorable attitude toward nato . 
  in the u.s. , a majority of democrats ( 56 % ) voice a favorable opinion of the organization , but only about four-in-ten republicans ( 43 % ) share that view . 
   the greatest change in support for nato has been in germany , where favorability of the alliance has fallen 18 points since 2009 , from 73 % to 55 % . 
  germans living in the east are divided -- 46 % see it positively , 43 % negatively . 
   the american public 's attitude toward nato belies the u.s. role in the organization . 
  u.s. defense expenditures account for 73 percent of the defense spending of the alliance as a whole . 
  and this is among the highest proportion of total alliance security spending since the early 1950s . 
  but only 49 % of americans express a favorable opinion of the security organization .

  the us needs to stop meddling in the affairs of others . 
   america fuck yeah at least you stick to your guns with who you think the bad guy is . 
  oh please , the fact is poland sent a token force and is not even close to an equal partner . 
  acting like the us owes them the world for that is insulting . 
  when poland can respond to an invasion of the us let me know . 
  that was discredited long ago .

  really , i 'll make note of that the next time this sub has a `` america did nothing in wwii circlejerk . '', 
  is that how it works ? 
  so the us can reduce it 's military to 20,000 and send 500 guys to europe for nato . 
  good plan .
