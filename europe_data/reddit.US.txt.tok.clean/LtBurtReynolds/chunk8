   what ? 
  you understand that amount of migrants coming in ? 
  r/europe will be happy to tell you about the ecnomy of scale and how this does n't matter . 
   they are illegal economic migrants . 
  you mean like the millions who have came into the us ? . 
   they did not pay taxes so they 're refugees . 
   how could you expect a french taxpayer to shoulder the burden of their healthcare ??? 
  because the french are always telling me healthcare is a human right . 
   that 's the reason why the soviets lost the cold war , they play a defensive game while the us plays an offensive one . 
  not so sure about that , the soviets topped government and invaded nations just like the us . 
  they were n't as good at it because their culture and government systems blew goats . 
  rock n roll and mcdonalds beat ak 's every time . 
  the first link even says that there is no actual change in the number of troops . 
  compare the number of troops in the 1990 's to now . 
  there is a trend . 
  are n't these all people in need of help ? 
  you guys have free university and healthcare along with free housing for the poor . 
  help them out . 
  i agree , interventionism rarely works out . 
  the us should have stayed out of it . 
  what gave them the right ? 
  or the americans it seems . 
   well we let us warplanes refuel in shannon airport on their way to iraq . 
  would we let iraq do the same on the way to the us ? 
  iraq is n't at war with the us . 
  and personally i think it 's shameful that you let the us do this . 
   they are wealthy , prosperous poorer than europe , in debt , no healthcare and you know the list of this we read of europeans when discussing how shit the us is every day here . 
   safe i 'm told that crime is `` out of control '' here and there are daily mass shootings , many europeans say the us is third world and too dangerous to visit . 
   ty much have the main say in what happens to our planet as a whole . 
  [ yeah , not so much ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zee5s/us_warns_europe_over_plan_to_demand_millions_in/ ), 
   if the european armed forces are needed to intervene with foreign nation , it should be done only through un . 
  like korea , libya , somalia and dozens of other situations that you would describe as `` murdering civilians or combatants in foreign countries for it 's own foreign policy reasons . '', 
   they acted like a occupation force with the traditional amount of abuse . 
  so true , the us was brutal against the french . 
   the french population begun to hate the american . 
  who does n't hate americans really ? 
  hopefully this hate can run it 's course and rive us apart where we belong . 
   we 'd already be a contender to them as a world power and no longer half-vassal states . 
  this is the multipolar world europe has been seeking , more power to you !, 
   hey guys , we 're gon na strip education and healthcare of money to spend it on the military which protects us from nonexistant threats because the us said so '' . 
  exactly , there is no threat to europe and nato is n't needed . 
  if anything the usa is your enemy . 
   there is actually quite a lot of sources saying that in some regions the people experienced more sexual assault from the us troops . 
  really link some and make sure they 're not just reporting that book where the guy made a faulty extrapolation . 
   it 's not hard to imagine that some non jews were happier with the germans than with the americans . 
  yeah the french were very happy with german occupation and hated the americans . 
  i agree . 
  i see , it 's a math issue you ca n't count . 
  thoughts on the visigoths ? 
   you can see the prevailing anglo-saxon narrative in the burkini threads and now in the new scotland yard fashion . 
  if you go to subreddits like worldnews the only thing you can see is americans talking about europe with 0 knowledge on any of the subjects . 
   holy fucking cancer . 
  it 's not enough that most of reddit is an anglo-saxon echo chamber , now even subs like this one are becoming like the rest . 
  pathetic . 
  you seem to have an obsession with america and `` anglo-saxons '' ... i have to ask , do you have a time machine ? 
  how do you think the russians would have handled the liberation , or should i say reoccupation . 
  i understand that , but there is a world of difference between seeing a liberating army attack an occupying than them both being the same . 
   70.000 french civilians died . 
  are there no accidents there ? 
  do you know what war is , are we at that level here ? 
   what else did you have in mind ? 
  what alternatives were there ? 
  did these people seriously not understand the realities of war having lived through it for years by then ? 
   t would seem like your whole live revolves around the opinion of people that are on the other end of the atlantic . 
  r/shitamericanssay also do you have any self awareness ? 
  your first page of comment history is nearly all about the us . 
  including an epic comment about how the us is `` going to attack europe '' because of corbyn .

  one , accidents are accidents . 
  two , comparing the liberation of france to syria is absurd . 
  `` liberate us from the nazis , but please do n't use weapons , anything but a war ! '', 
  i 'll ask again , what else did you have in mind ? 
  what alternatives were there ? 
  did these people seriously not understand the realities of war having lived through it for years by then ? 
   is it not okay to accept that when liberating france , the allied forces did a lot of damage holy shit , you mean that during a war , weapons are used including bombs ? 
  what else did you have in mind ? 
  what alternatives were there ? 
  it 's complete nonsense to complain about a military fighting a war . 
   the french people at the time did n't like the allied that much ? 
  then they are hopelessly ignorant . 
  it 's like complaining about a doctor cutting you open to remove cancer . 
  lets call it what it is , an illegal invasion and war crimes . 
  it 's a shame no one was tried for the allied invasion of france . 
  i agree , the allies were not the good guys and had no business invading france . 
  they should have charged those people with war crimes . 
  it 's a shame they thought they had the right to invade france . 
  that 's because they knew the soviets would win the space race and the cold war . 
  the best part i thought was the title . 
   new american and british studies have debunked the myth that french people were happy for liberation myth debunked , america is literally worse than nazi germany !, 
  a perfect storm for karma . 
  there are about 280 comments there , nearly all of them based on the title alone . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's called the circlejerk . 
  there were a handful of brave souls who did click the link and they were astounded to find that the video in no way had anything to do with the title the op chose , he just made it up and everyone ran with it . 
  it 's just a clip from an episode of * wwii in color * , which was on the history channel 24/7 a few years ago . 
  and as we [ learned here in r/europe , new studies show the french people were not happy with the liberation ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4wvkff/new_american_and_british_studies_have_debunked/ ) . 
  french redditors even spoke about how the us destroyed france and they wished the russians had [ been the ones to get to france first ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4wvkff/new_american_and_british_studies_have_debunked/d6ab7ne ) . 
   it is regrettably the normal state of affaire that spying is done by many countries , not just the us . 
  two wrongs do not make a right . 
  there 's nothing wrong with spying on foreign nations . 
  i do n't feel offended and expect your nation to do so in it 's own interests .
