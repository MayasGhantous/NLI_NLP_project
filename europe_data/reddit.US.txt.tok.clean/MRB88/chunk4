  poland is a wonderful country with a rich cultural tradition and a very bright future !, 
  i 'm thankful that our countries have been such good friends for centuries and hope that relationship continues for centuries to come . 
  obama did n't want to do anything legislatively because it would then be open to public debate . 
  he undertook a lot of actions through executive action and administrative rule making - that way he could keep them in the shadows . 
  let 's not forget countless extrajudicial killings , routinly violating the sovereignty of foreign states , escalating civil instability , creating an interest rate . 
  bubble ... well , the list goes on . 
  sure - my question was more aimed at the public opinion part . 
  i glean that charles is far less popular than his mother . 
  do you think that would have any impact on the vote if she is gone due to public opinion ? 
  oh now , nothing bad could ever come from the british parliament denying self rule to a people based on a domestic economic and political situation . 
  ( cough ) 1776bestyearoflife ( cough ), 
  nato would want scotland in but it all depends on how nasty the remaining uk delegation wants to be with it . 
  may i ask another stupid question - how do you think the situation would change if , between now and the referendum , liz kicks the bucket and scotland would have king charles if they follow that path ? 
  not so much about the legalistic side , more about popular opinion ? 
  ( not that i wish it on her at all mind you , the queen seems like a sweet old lady but she ** is ** an exceptionally old lady . 
  or because he actually plans to crack down on international wire transfers from illegal aliens residing in the u.s. as opposed to deficit spending to build a wall . 
  eh ... i 'm actually in a position where i might be able to afford one sooner rather than later . 
  been saving a few hundred a month since i finished paying off my car over a year ago for that purpose and a friend of a friend has an m16a1 lower he is ready to part with for a reasonable sum . 
  if he has valid papers being the key term . 
  i 'm sorry but documents from nigeria are far more suspicious than those from a first world nation - identity theft is a thing . 
  besides , you 're missing my point . 
  anyone going to a foreign country agrees to play by that country 's immigration rules . 
  period . 
  its almost like you guys need something on your border to keep out those you do n't want flooding into your country !, 
  maybe something like a fence or some sort of barricade ... there has to be a better word for what you could build but ... i ca n't seem to think of it off hand . 
   for real though - it seems that keeping people in turkey just increases the number of migrants in turkey and thus strengthens erdogan 's bargaining power . 
  are you at all nervous that turkey might let the floodgates go if erdogan gets increasingly more demanding and the e.u. 
  is n't willing to accommodate him ( full e.u. 
  status comes to mind ) ? 
  cool !, 
  well i 'll be reapplying again soon now that i have the all clear from the docs . 
  ( though i 'll probably put in for dss . ), 
  sigh ... because its nearly impossible to get one here . 
  machine guns start at about $ 20,000 usd and require a ton of paperwork and almost a year of waiting for the government to process your request . 
  do i have ** a ** gun ? 
  no , of course i do n't have ** a ** gun . 
  oh i can beat q 8 for poland !, 
  `` yes , but only if they are catholic . '', 
  yeah - but there 's context . 
  he was asked a professional question because he was claiming to be an expert computer engineer . 
  if i 'm trying to enter another country as a technical expert , i have no problem demonstrating professional skills to immigration officials . 
  eh ... that 's actually been happening since 2006 with democrats using poland and romania 's visa waiver program exception as a bargaining chip . 
  actually not the case !, 
  the foreign service has a series of four silos that rarely allow crossover . 
  the people issuing foreign visas are part of the consular office and do n't touch management , economic , public affairs , or political roles . 
  you might get assigned a different fso at any given appointment but they will all be visa specialists in the consular branch and follow the same rulebook . 
  source : i passed the foreign service exam and had an offer as an economic officer but could n't get medically cleared for worldwide service so had to let that go . 
  as an american , i 'm totally okay with this for poland and hope trump fulfills his promise . 
  poland is a staunch u.s. ally and has been for decades . 
  the eu can `` fight back '' but until you get rid of all the national embassies in washington and have only one eu embassy , that 's not how the game works . 
  that 's not actually true - it was debunked . 
  even if ivanka took on some of the ceremonial duties , melania is still the first lady . 
  honestly , from what i 've seen , melania seems to just not like the spotlight at all . 
  i do n't really blame her for wanting to keep a low profile as possible . 
  there are massive differences between republicans and islamic immigration from the middle east . 
  while some republicans are quite religious , we pretty much hold western liberal democratic values even though religion is a part of life . 
  look at parts of spain or italy , poland , etc. 
  for other places that are similar . 
  some might oppose gay marriage or abortion but no one is calling for the mass execution of gays or for banning travel for women without a male family member . 
  both of those are prevalent in the middle east and they are deeply ingrained cultural values that are hard to break . 
  even moderate muslims hold relatively extreme views - look at the study that was done a few years ago on muslims in britain . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law . 
  while i know liberal muslims too who are rational , these are considered the extreme liberal in comparison to the overwhelming majority in islamic societies . 
  basically , its cultural not religious . 
  i think a lot of people would happily move their financial centers to glasgow as opposed to having to find a new home that was totally geographically separated from the uk . 
  and the reason the city of london is the financial center is because the uk is in the eu . 
  do you think that if the uk is disallowed from clearing euro transactions , that the banks wo n't up and leave ? 
  nothing - but the problem is the there were serious lies told to the people pre vote . 
  scrapping of eu regulations is not going to happen because they the products ca n't be sold there . 
  immigration is not going to slow because of the influx from places like india and pakistan as opposed to eu nationals . 
  the banking sector is probably going to lose passporting rights , with a loss of jobs , international prestige , and global influence . 
  the people who said these things were shouted down but now the people have to face reality . 
  well , let 's ignore the fact that forcing medicaid expansion was illegal and those states that did expand the program are facing serious financial issues . 
  maybe if the democrats had n't rammed through the law without a single republican vote using shady procedural maneuvering , the republicans would n't have felt the need to undermine . 
  you 're getting down votes but it is a real concern . 
  forced relocations , silenced leaders , brutal political oppression , and curtailing the freedom of religion also happen . 
  but please , let 's totally ignore the right of self determination . 
  its almost like it is n't a good idea to cross the mediterranean in a tiny boat . 
  or deliberately sink the ship so that you are rescued or delivered to italy/greece , though i 'm not saying that what happened here was a deliberate sinking . 
  the migrants need to realize that they are taking on a huge risk if they get into a boat in the first place . 
  the problem is - how does anyone verify that the person in question was actually against the assad regime ? 
  short version , you ca n't . 
  i expect that if isil won , many of those same people would claim to have been against isil to stay . 
  eesti can into religion ? 
  yeah , this seems like a short term win for greece and a long term win for china . 
  i 'm not sure i 'd be thrilled with having chinese hooks in an eu member state ... 
  because islam is still a minority in europe . 
  do n't worry , the flags will go away eventually . 
  let 's also not forget how fdr seized gold from the us population paying a fraction of what it was worth and declaring holding any sizable amount illegal . 
  if polish women are n't enough to motivate to learn polish , what makes you think bureaucrats of any ilk will ? 
  looks delightful !, 
  - signed a guy who is living in 35 c weather and hates it !, 
  hm ... is that a generally known fact ? 
  implying that the unsc holds any value in today 's world is laughable . 
   because it 's pretty dangerous ( and unconstitutional ) to ban things you find uncomfortable or jarring . 
  you mean like swastikas and holocaust skeptics ? 
  not in the slightest . 
  i 'm very happy not to have a monarch and i 'm glad you guys have found something that works for you . 
  though i wonder if a wave of republicanism will sweep the u.k. when liz kicks off in the next few years . 
  it 's a book .
